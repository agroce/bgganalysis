Just one solo play, so missed out on someone fleshing out the descriptions with flavour.
Far less decisions than I was expecting.  Its a sit back and enjoy the ride (or not) game.  By the end I was sex-changed, crippled and On Pilgramige, so not going to win any time soon.  Not that it is about winning.
Not really sure its my type of game, but will try it again with someone else.

This isn't a game, it is an experience.  You enjoyment level will be completely dictated by the group you are playing with.  I do not recommend playing with more than 4, as the lag time between doing something (reading, playing, being the matrix person) can really drag.

Variant: First to 20 combined D/S wins; no need to return to Baghdad. Only one status per character. 

Essential house rule: change the daytime every time the first player begins his/her turn again. Otherwise, you will be stuck in the morning phase throughout the entire game and won't be able to reach and experience many of the book's encounters, as running through the whole encounter deck (which normally triggers the change of daytime by the official rules) literally never happened in my many games with 2-4 players.

I love Talisman.  I still have my collection of Choose Your Own Adventure books sitting proudly on my book shelf.  I even love the Arabian Nights theme.  But I really dislike Tales of the Arabian Nights.  Perhaps I only dislike it because it pales in comparison to similar games.  Maybe my expectations were misplaced.  

I never expected to be shocked by how pointlessly random a game was.  But this one did it to me.  It's literally more fun to buy a copy of the book this game is based and have your game group take turns reading it to each other.  Actually, that sounds like a pretty fun idea.

This game is heavily dependent on your group.  With the right mood, setting, and people, this game can be a blast.  Also, I think that the game plays a little long for what it is.  Often, I tire of the game about 3/4 of the way through.

(Oct. 2012) Whenever I play, I usually put victory at any combination of 10-15 points depending on length.  This drastically helps the game and has caused my opinion of Tales to rise.

I understood going in that this was less of a game and more of an interactive story so I was still looking forward to it.  However, it ended up being better in concept than execution.

The game just feels too random and tedious to be fun.  We played a 3 player HALF game and didn't even finish in 2 hours!  

I didn't care that much about winning but even then it feels impossible to even make choices that will advance the game period.  You end up wandering aimlessly around when you even do get a choice.

The stories were fun, but choices that would seem to make sense end up randomly punishing you so that you feel like you made the "wrong" choice instead of a "fun" choice.

I'd play again, but definitely not purchasing this.  Try before you buy!

RATING: 9
Just one 2 player game so far and really enjoyed it. The fact that winning or losing has little to do with skill (or so it seems) adds to its charm - its a story with a board, not a boardgame as such. Initial rating is 1 off a 10 because I think this would drag seriously with four or more players. I'm sure three is the sweetspot, although two was excellent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a really special game. As countless others have stated before me, it is less of a game and more of an experience.

The unique strength of this game is that most turns involve some fundamental change to the character's fate and, over the course of a game, it does feel like life... not life when things make sense but life when it throws you a sidewinder and you live through it and forget it and then look back at it and say, "was that really still me?"

Those are the kind of changes that this game abounds with. Another aspect of it that is unique is that most of the decisions that your character has to make are not "how" decisions but "what" decisions. This brings the game-play experience closer to "who do I want my character to be" and further from "how do I get what I want". 

There is now a slew of story-oriented / reading games on the horizon but, from what I've read about them, they do not offer this kind of radical freedom. 

My only complaint is that the point-system can distract from all of the above - if ever you think you can somehow 'play' the game, that's when the experience can die down... and that temptation does arise from time to time.

RATING: 7
Strategy be damned! Sometimes you just need to go on a roller coaster ride and see what happens to you. Tales of Arabian Nights shines in the story-telling department, bringing exciting tales of wild success along with depressing and hilarious tales of woe. 

With just the slightest "game" structure added for motivation, Tales is really an activity-in-disguise. But that matters not when there are thousands of different story snippets to guide the variety of put-upon heroes, such as Aladdin and Sinbad. Another game that is important to play with a crowd of people just looking to have fun, Tales excels at weaving strange and unpredictable stories.

Add a little extra flavor to the game by having one player make sound effects during a story reading, while another player acts out the events of the unfolding event.

RATING: 6
First play was with two - and it was very fun. Played in about 90 minutes. I recall playing this in the 80's and loving it then - although it played itself out after awhile. I think that might happen again, but for now, I'm looking forward to our next play. It's great fun.

Second play was with three - and played in about 2 hours. Still very fun - and quite the variety of things happen. It's very much an adventure and nice for a change of pace.

Third play was with four and at times, five (one fellow left). The game didn't know when to get off the table and there was no way to speed that along. Getting thrown in jail is truly annoying and then later, completely easy to get out - the one place that is repetitive in the tome. This one is probably just a holiday game now - bring it out once or twice a year at most.

And then it has left my collection. Regrets? Not really. More of a fondness now than actually wanting to play again. It is at times amazingly fun. Then it is amazingly not.

Traducido al castellano, megacurrada de Decanox de Asylum Games! Reglas + MEGALIBRACO! Es un juego único en su especie. Una fusión de juego de mesa con juego de rol. Y se puede jugar casi con cualquiera, que guste del género narrativo y aventura. Recuerda en parte a aquellos libros de "elige tu propia aventura" :)
Se recomienda hasta 4 jugadores o menos. Con más, hace el entre-turno demasiado largo. Recomendado usar ciertas variantes que mejoran el juego.

Te mueves por el mapa, tienes encuentros en las localizaciones y en función del tipo de acción que elijas & las habilidades que dispongas  lees un párrafo en concreto con lo que sucede & que consecuencias tiene para tu personaje, pudiendo encontrar tesoros, aumentar o conseguir más habilidades, estados mentales, físicos o sociales positivos o negativos, aumentar o disminuir tu estatus de riqueza y conseguir puntos de destino y puntos de historia, que la combinación positiva de ambos y regresar a Bagdad, es lo que hace ganar la partida. Toda una experiencia de juego a disfrutar!

Only played 4 player but doesn't really feel that much like a game. Tried to be an RPG but lacks the story element and doesn't really have much choice to be a board game. Quests are quite random with large fluctuations in difficulty. Seems far easier to earn Story over Destiny. Too much downtime in larger games is evident.

RATING: 6
Adventure gaming at its best. If that's all you care about that is. It is not a game, rather than a collage of different mini-encounters that write your story. It is rather long with many twists and so a lot can happen to you but trying to find what paragraph to read next becomes tedious quickly. This is a very unique experience for a board game and for that it is worth a try.

This game is a super fun "I don't really have all that much control but I'm loving it anyway" game. I laughed a ton in my few playthroughs, it's not a strategy game, it's not a game about winning (at least for me), so if you go into it thinking that you will be sorely disappointed.

If there is one thing I repeatedly argue about with the Other Player, it is the inability of certain board games to actually tell the story they are trying to sell. Well, here comes the King of all story telling games that all others will have to compare themselves to. 
Playing Tales is as beautiful as the eyes of Sheherazade, as exciting as a trip on Aladdins magic carpet, as mystical as the dark grove in Sindbads adventures. While playing, you can easily forget that it is indeed not a cooperative game. You may actually forget you're playing a board game. Tales is much more like a friendly introduction to role playing games.
If there is on tiny thing I would wish for if a magical Genie turned up and asked me about my whishes, I would ... naturally speak to him about something entirely unrelated to board games. But if, say, the designer of Tales 2.0 climbed out of that lamp, I would probably ask him for a digital version of the story book, because shuffling through the pages all the time really gets annoying after a while. But really, this feels like complaining about the color of the fabric after someone gave you a flying carpet for Christmas.

This game is a blast, but I do have a small problem with it. That is of the feel of the game. Sometimes it feels more like the game is playing you and not the other way around. At time it can feel like you don't have any control whatsoever over what is happening to you. Still, the stories can pull out a lot of laughs and most of the time everyone at the table is interested in everyone else's turn (which is rare these days).

I can play this game over and over and not get tired of it. Every time is different. Yes, you might run into some of the same storybook scenarios, but not often, and even then I don't generally remember which choices give which outcomes (with the exception of being Imprisoned, which can be terribly repetitive if you can't get out!). This game rarely feels like someone is dominating, and generally, I don't even care who is winning since the playing itself is just so fun! I have played with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 players, and all were fun, it just takes longer with more people. Most of the time, I don't want the game to end anyway!

RATING: 8
FANTASTIC game for groups that enthusiastically commit to role playing their characters and dive into immersion gaming practices. Also great for storytellers, readers and creative minds alike. 

People who won't like this game are those who like quick play games, do this, then that, then add up points type gamers. There's a lot of dice rolling so less strategy than many would prefer. Also, people who are closed minded to various world cultures and religions would suffer tremendously through this brilliant game. Those who want to learn more about folklore of the "others", well, this is a win.  Those offended by "Allah" best pick a different title.  Or better yet, play it and read some factual unbiased material before/after to become educated on the good (oft forgotten toward those) who do know "Allah". It's really a minor part of the game but enough it will create disdain for extremists. 

For me and my family, we deeply enjoy enriching our minds, hearts and lives with other cultures, ways and beliefs AND we tremendously devour creativity and imagination type adventures.  Naturally this game was a big hit at our home.

I don't understand the draw of this game.  The decisions you do make seem to have a totally random result.  Plus the cards are devastating, unforgiving, and in some cases almost impossible to get rid of.  Based on that the "game" is broken.  However this isn't a game - it's a story - and a poor one at that.  It blows me away that people make fun of monopoly and play this!  I would say it's more fun than getting your teeth cleaned - but I'd be lying.

Fun.  The goal of the game is to have a good story - winning or losing is incidental.  I like how it plays and how it forces other players to pay attention when it's not their turn (by making them handle the interaction tables and book).  Loses some points for the randomness inherent in the gameplay mechanics, but gains points for theme.  Will gladly play again.

AVOID THE LAKE OF COLORS!

RATING: 8
A great story telling game, but not one for actual "gameplay". As an experience it is fantastic, especially if you can get into a character and go with the story. I recently played a game as an attractive merchant, who sold his wares into two far off cities, then upset a Djin who banished him to a far off land. He then met some people who wanted to tease a vizier, who wasn't happy about it, and sent him to jail. I then spent the rest of the game trying to bribe, attack and converse with the guards to no escape. 
The game is random, but so long as you go along for the ride and accept this, it'll be a fun time. There really is nothing like it.
I wouldn't say this is one that will always be brought out, but when it is, you are in for an evening of amusing tales.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The very random nature of most encounters and paragraphs takes away a lot of strategic thinking.

1st play: I appreciate the exposure to a mythos that isn't classic middle ages fantasy.  That said, the game is extremely random, and the charts and page flipping seems kindof excessive.  Mechanically it's warranted but still it's too much.

Even if you like storytelling 'games', there just isn't anything going on. Your actions don't even correlate to basic cause-and-effect a lot of the time. 

Sometimes games are held up because they pioneered certain mechanisms. Like Cosmic Encounter, I think this game relies on that completely.

TotAN is a make-your-own-adventure game, very nice if you look for this kind of experience.

What I didn't like:
- it's not really a game, so you must have the right crowd with which to play

RATING: 6
Right - straight off. This isn't a game.

It's a storytelling experience for several players to go through independently at the same time.

The decision of what score you're aiming for is meaningless as there's very little indication in the rules or on the cards what your actions might score. 

Skills are also a luck based thing - you may use one skill repeatedly, or get no skills used at all without any basis in your decisions.

That being said, it's a great fun way to spend an evening!

The board and pieces are functional and beautiful in equal measure.

I'd like it in trade to while some time away with the other half...

Great 'experience' game where winning isn't really the end goal although it is there if you need it to be. Create your own narrative to a unique story as you play. The game play is surprisingly simple allowing you to sit back and enjoy the fun unlike my other favorite experience game, Magic Realm. The game works with kids for the most part as well as non-gamers to some extent although you often will get some confusion over the concept of a game without a real need to win. The components in this version are very nice and the game is well worth the price. Lots of fun.

I recognize that this should not be rated as a game, or even approached as a game, but rather as an experience, and that's what rates it a 6 for me. Thematically, it's wonderful, and the art is great. And there is SOOOOO much bad luck in it, that it is worth playing just for laughs. It's a fun experience, but not a great experience. I like the theme.....but I'd probably rate it higher with a different theme (like Norse mythology, or the Chronicles of Narnia). I might also rate it higher if it didn't take so long. For me to play something like this for such a long time, it would have to have FAR more tension to hold my interest, and it is not at all tense. I can't understand at all why it is rated so highly here, but I suppose RPG fans would dearly love it. I am not an RPG fan, but I have certainly played much more interesting RPG's.

*Revised from 7 to 6 due to new storytelling games casting shade on what's starting to feel like a more dated game.

At least 60 minutes per player, unless you house-rule the points cap downwards to speed things up. Feels WAY too long without that change, and you will probably never get through the deck to reach the 'afternoon/night' phase of the cards unless you also house-rule that encounter deck down to a set number of cards. I strongly recommend implementing both.
By the end of a game, I was a crippled scorned insane beastperson, and still loved the game. A game for existentialism, not strategy. Unfortunately, play depth vs play time is not a good balance.

Less of a competitive game than a shared choose your own adventure.  The story book is a work of genius, the theme is fantastic, and the play is fairly smooth once you figure out the encounter mechanics.  The fun comes from your group and how it plays together, although the game has ample suggestions for interesting/comedic reactions to situations.  There's a bit of down time between turns if you have more than 3 players, so you might want a drink or two in hand.

Update: Once you have played a few times, it gets really old.  I made it a point to get to the dusky land, and I've been twice with limited success.  There are better ways to spend a long session, although it's still a good activity for non-gamers.

Tales is essentially a story telling game. It's weakness is that the story it tells is just a series of disconnected incidents, many of them trivial. Too often I get the sense of wandering aimlessly about the board from one encounter to the next.  The quests don't do enough to correct this because their pay-off in terms of plot development and character progression is poor.   

The Z-Man edition is very well produced, though the artwork is only so-so.

Not a game, but a hostage situation. The lack of any actual, meaningful choice is stunning, and even when an action seems completely logical you may wind up hamstrung by your choice.

I played a single game, and that was enough. "Grief-Stricken" from turn one, I could do nothing throughout the entire 3+ hours it took to plod through this crapfest. Further negative status effects meant that my actions were predetermined by the game and that someone else made all my other decisions for me, including where I moved on the map, so even while the game's choices are completely arbitrary I didn't get to make a single one of them.

You can tell me that I got unlucky, that the chances of getting so screwed are remarkably slim, that it'll be better next time, but there won't be a next time. The simple fact that the game would have been no different had I left the table, and that I was taken out of the game from the very first turn, means that this is not any sort of actual game. A fun activity? Maybe for some. As for me, I'd rather perform DIY dental surgery or play house-rules Monopoly with a bunch of PCP-intoxicated bonobos.

RATING: 10
A VERY nice product which is even better than the original version. This game is playable with 2 players but is far far better with 4. A gift for storytelling helps as the game centres around encounter cards and especially the Book of Tales, which is best read with a bit of ad-libbing to give the game a storytelling feel. It gears itself well to the non-gamer as there is very little skill involved, it is mostly on the encounter reactions which may not end out the way you would expect....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's basically a choose-your-own-adventure novel collaborative experience. It's great. The theme is brilliant and the 'Book of Tales' is clearly crafted with love and inhuman levels of perseverance. Essentially it's a game where you get into the mine cart and hang on as the game takes you along its varied and entertaining twists and turns. You know what? That's fine. Non-gamers and gamers alike have taken a shine to this. It has literally thousands of stories to tell.

More of a really fun and immersive experience than an actual 'game-game'.  A lot of fun to be had for those who are able to focus less on winning and more on the adventures each player goes through.

Very simple and easy to learn game. Plays like a choose your own adventure book with everyone living their own story. Some of the choices and outcomes don't always seem to make sense (I chose to sneak, so why is Weapon Use skill a choice but not the Stealth and Sneaking skill? and "what the hell did have to do with me sneaking?!") but is still a decent story game. Traded away as Above and Below and Agents of SMERSH just do a better job with the story telling aspect.

RATING: 6.5
Not so much a game as playing through a huge choose your own adventure fantasy story. There are some gaming mechanics within such as trying to complete goals chosen on cards at the start of the game and throughout. But mostly you are making decisions via multiple choice and hoping that things go well for you. Do you attack the beggar that requests a coin? Do you flirt with the princess that accidentally walks into you in the market? Choose carefully. You never know what might happen. No skill required. Just a decent imagination and about 2+ hours that you'll need to play. Not much of a game truly but still so so so much fun.

The tale's the thing, and the journey is the best part of the game.  Honestly, winning and losing doesn't matter - this is not a game to fire your competitive juices.

I am not sure if any story-telling game will top either the complexity or the satisfaction of the Arabian Nights. Grinds to a miserable halt with more than 4 players; best with 3, because everyone is always involved. Even when it's slow as molasses, though, a greatly enjoyable game which always results in laughter and a grand time.

Well, you do have to be very clear that there's not much of a game there. Anyone expecting to find a strategy to pursue towards winning will be greatly disappointed.

Rated on its design and implementation of story-telling. I agree with others that this is less a game per se and more an experience, which is, on occasion, exactly what I am looking for. At the end of the game, I don't care at all whether I have won or lost. Having only played it three times so far, I don't see how to decide about my story/destiny end game points when it appears entirely out of my control which track will advance the most.  I also wish that logical decision making with regard to one's skills paid off more than it has so far in the games I've played. That said, I still enjoy each experience and look forward to trying some of the official variants.

RATING: 8.6
The production values here are great, with a wonderful board, cards, and pieces, plus the massive Tales book which you will be referring to as your characters move through this ancient world. It's an interactive story telling game, though that interaction is in how the players narrate eat others tales; sort of like a massive multiplayer Choose Your Own Adventure book but with a board component and a minimal rules structure to make it slightly more gamey. You'll keep track of your movement, Story and Destiny points (each player hides his ultimate goal), and the rewards you get from Encounters and completing Quests. I do really like the simplistic Skills tile system, offers some added variety each time you play. Arabian Nights is a lot of fun, but just know what you're getting into here.

10/9/16: The lamp appears to be too strong because you can use it to obtain the 'blessed' trait which which you can use to offset any dice roll that would cause you to lose the lamp.  Next time we play we'll say that you can't use 'blessed' the same turn you acquire it.  We also roll the '+/-' dice to determine the time of day.  Otherwise the time doesn't change enough.

3/5/16: There's a free android app from 'Cruelty Free Pirates' that really speeds up playing.

8/21/15: Choose your own adventure.  One of those classic, "the journey is the destination."  Similar to Talisman in that your destiny is determined by wild swings of fate.

This is a great family style game.  For the eurogamers, not so much.

Plays well with 2.  I'm not certain that I'd want to play with more than four because of down time.

Still vivid in my mind, an absolute blast. Never think I've had so much fun, laughing at my own and others misfortune. Granted not much planing can be done in this game, but it's a game that you play for the experience. And what an experience that is.
Will introduce this to my family next time I get the chance, though might play for less than 20 points as they are not used to playing games that are too long.
In what other game can you be a married envious deceased crippled female, trying to return to your home city so you can then have a child and then go on a pilgrimage, and hopefully win the game? (Well I didn't win, but I really had a fun time playing).

You can't beat nostalgia. This was the first serious board game I ever played - well, the '80s version was. I had resigned myself to never having it myself, when I learned that Z-Man was remaking it. It was an instant buy in California, and we had to pack it in for our flight home!

The best way to play this game is with a storytelling variant (no bonus rewards necessary). The best advice I have for that is to tie each adventure together! Have recurring characters and items. Maybe even role play a bit? The Book of Tales is just the beginning, and it doesn't have all the answers - but it certainly poses the right questions.

Despite being impressed at the amount of work it must have taken to write the game book... I found this game to be annoying, repetitive, and void of any interesting/meaningful decisions. Granted, it's a story-telling game but the format seems inappropriate; it tells a short-story and makes that experience incredibly fiddly. 

There's certainly an audience for this game. In fact, a young girl asked us to play and she seemed entirely enamored with the game. But be sure to know what your getting into... because it's not a typical game.

RATING: 3
"will play sporadically if in the right mood" prefectly describes my attitude towards this "game".  (I gave it a bump to 6.5 because it can be a great time with a good crowd)

As others have said, Tales isn't really a game but more of an "experience".  Which is a shame because I think there are probably ways to keep the primary ideas behind it (a story-telling / choose-your-own-adventure style production) but still give players a bit more control over their destiny.

As long as players have the right expectations this is a fine (and lavishly produced) title.  I can't help thinking that it could have been a home run if it had a bit more "game" in it.

UPDATE:
Ultimately Tales is a "beautiful failure".  I respect its scope and ambition but it falls short of its goal -- even if you agree not to evaluate this as a "game" and more a story telling experience.

Stories are supposed to be focused and purposeful.  Character's usually should have goals and this gives their actions meaning.

Because the gameplay in Tales is so weak, the character's dont really have goals to speak of or any challenge to overcome.  Nothing really drives their decisions.  Not only does this make for a bad game (which fans will say is not the point of Tales), but it makes for dreadful stories (which is supposedly the whole point)!

Mostly Tales is just one perplexing schadenfreude gag after another.  It's a collection of surprising prat-falls with no actual narrative to string them together.

plus...despite a huge book of tales, you still get a surprising amount of repeats (even in a single session).  "you got beaten by monkeys...again"

Tales is a non-game that generates boring, non-sensical stories.

Based on one game: nicely produced story driven (pick-our-own-adventure style) game. Not too many decisions to make on a logical basis, since the outcome is quite arbitrary..

Provides its fun through narrative events. The default rules end up causing Arabian Nights to run a bit longer than we want. We typically house rule it to shorten the length. 

Edit: May 2017. I ended up selling this game, as there just isn't a game here. It's a randomized choose your own adventure with dice rolling and a board. It has the potential of being a fun romp that generates laughs, but it vastly overstays its welcome without house rules. Not for me.

This re-make of the 1985 classic is a winner.  The game is faster (usually a bad thing in re-makes; for example the gutted re-make of Fury of Dracula) but in this case it's good. The glitches where one gets over-burdened with statuses  (although I sometimes miss the resulting chaos), can't get out of prison or find their way home have been largely fixed and I can throw away my home-made sheets listing all the statuses, their effects and how to get rid of them.

The only real drawback is that I actually prefer the art-work on the smaller, old board than that on the newer, brighter one, but the larger pieces don't really fit on it.

This game has you cross-referencing complex tables by TWO players before you get a completely random result that you have no influence on whatsoever. You might as well just pick a completely random story from the book by throwing a dart at it. There is a game board, but there is no way to influence or predict the outcome of your movements. Therefore your decisions don't matter at all. You might as well walk around blindly. This is the worst "game" I've ever played.

I'm not sure this is a game, it's more of a barely-interactive story. That's not a criticism though, this is unique and is worth an occasional play. Just don't try and boast that you've beaten someone at it.

What a fun game experience and nice break from typical games.  We don't really play to 'win' so much as tell a story.  The 'win' aspect is just a timer for us as the game can get kinda long.

Reading the (real)book, regardless of translation, may give extra ideas on how to tell the story.

Approximately one hour per player with the "win combination" total at 20. To speed things up lower this total.

First Play: The production quality is excellent and the story book and matrix took me back to my D'n'D days.

But.........

This isn't a game unless you class snakes and ladders as a credible game. Apart from the judgement required to move your character, you can input no meaningful strategy into your turn. You select skills, you encounter a situation, you decide whether you have a relevant action that supports one of these skills, you make an informed choice, roll a die and the corresponding passage is read from the master tome. In all cases your skill has no bearing on the subsequent turn of events and you receive a random allocation of points and perhaps a treasure.

The random flip of encounters just adds to the chaos. 

Our 6 player game lasted 4 hours with enormous down time between turns when you have nothing to do or consider.

It started off as a little fun but after 2 hours I was willing the experience to end but could see that the points gained were no where near.

If this game had been around 30 years ago when the Fighting Fantasy books had come out it would have been a smash hit. Now it is just a lame passive slog through a series of random die rolls and equally chaotic illogical responses that decide what points, hindrances or benifits are given to each player.

I really should give this a 1 as I never want to play again and don't think its a game, but we did laugh from time to time, but what a waste of 4 hours.

More of an experience than a strategy game.  A little long if you play to 20 points.  Playing to less points and only one status at a time makes for a shorter better game.  A unique experience.

I used to have the West End Games version of this as a teenager and just loved it (wish I saved it). This version is great, but I just don't get the same adventurous feeling playing it now. It seems too "gamey" and less story based. I am going to play solitaire very soon and will update this when I do. Update: Played the solitaire game twice this month and enjoyed it! You have a little more control over the fate of your character then you would originally think. It was tough using the "night" numbers of the encounter deck, but I managed 2 wins, 1 right when the encounter deck would have ran out, handing me a loss. Will be doing lots of solitaire T.O.T.A.N. in the near future.

RATING: 7.5
Really fun (and funny) "storytelling" game that plays like a choose-your own adventure novel on a gameboard. The wide variety of encounters, reactions, and outcomes is truly staggering when you think about it. A feat of game design to be sure, but one that often leads into random outcomes and setbacks when you least expect them. But hey, such is life, and it doesn't discredit this game as being a fun one to play.

I have no doubt this will be a treasured life-long possession. There aren't many games that can pack this much magic into a box. Definitely worth every cent of the 100+ bucks I paid for it. It's great for bonding with friends, as you'll always come away with things to laugh about together and stories to tell. To really enjoy it, though, you'll need to forget about making meaningful strategic decisions, since no matter the choose-your-own-adventure choices you make, you can be led in any number of unpredictable directions. It's not a game that you play; it's actually the game that plays YOU. Just strap in to your magic carpets and enjoy the ride! And here are the house rules that I play with: 1) Change the morning/midday/night tokens after every round, instead of when the card deck runs out. More variability that way. 2) Each player holds only one status card at a time. Two is okay too, but any more than that and it starts to get too unweildy and confusing. 3) Men are able to court men, and women are able to court women. The fact that same-sex romance was banned in the original rules is just anachronistic rubbish. 4) Having a sex-change does NOT prevent you from winning the game. Again, that's just outdated dinosaur values getting in the way of a good game. Solidarity to all the beautiful transfolk out there.

TEDIOUS.  BORING.   POINTLESS.  Just try to make me play this again.  Huge disappointment.  Draw a card.  Roll a dice (add/ subtract random stuff).  Look that up.  Decide what to do.  Look at the chart.  Roll dice again.  Add or subtract result to number you found.  Grab the book and look up what happened to you.  "The other runs away.  Gain 2 story points"  Next players turn.

RATING: 9
This was a very pleasant experience, best compares to Arkham/Eldritch Horror and Relic/Talisman, but a more general game suitable for wider and not so nerdy audiences and with more control on what you do. And a competitive game, not a co-op. Lots of small stories emerge during the game with many unforeseen twists. I would say this game is like a delicacy that you want to have occasionally, but not in too big portions to not wear it off. Currently my only worry is the replayability, but the story book plus matrix is big, so that should be ok.

Very nice looking RPG/Boardgame hybrid. It can get a bit fiddly when looking up everything on the charts, but the stories that unfold while playing this game are just fabulous! This game is dripping with theme and a pleasure to play. If you just want to sit back and enjoy the ride with this storytelling game in which you have no real say in what is going to happen to you, you will have a great time. However, if you have the illusion that you're going to win this game by using your well thought out strategy you better stay clear.

I enjoyed the game; we played with 5, probably too much downtime; sweetspot should be 4.

You can randomly be thrown in jail or lose control of decision-making abilities, which is frustrating and limiting.  Aside from this, the game is enjoyable to experience the happenings of your adventures.

Very well-done as far as the theme and style of the stories is concerned, very impressive in just how convoluted those matrices and paragraphs are.  If they are a little too convoluted...well...oh well.

I played for one hour the solo variant to try out the game. I couldn't stop. I was thinking to myself ''one more turn, just one more turn'' but the time was 4 am so I had to stop eventually. I am starting with an [b]8[/b]

11.Oct.09
First play with three players. I had build up my expectations through out this year while waiting for this to come out. I am a little disappointed but it may be because it was our first game. 

Rating 8>7

A note to gamers who don't speak English fluently: To fully  enjoy the game the players have to read dramatically, do voices etc. You also need to have a decent English accent or a really good fake Indian accent :laugh: Our natural eastern European accent didn't fit the setting one bit!

Amazing game.  Cannot get enough of it.  Never the same twice, especially if you move the time marker every trip round the table.  One of the best experiences you can have at a gaming table.

Then this probably isn't for you as it contains actual fun.

A pretty game that takes quite awhile to play usually at least 3 to closer to 4 hours to play.  As a role playing game it is good but as board game somewhat less so.  Has a tendency to be rather negative in its decision process and usually has no sense when it comes to decisions as to how one responds to a given situation.  Results are usually negative and penalties can multiply on any given character which can become very burdensome later in the game.

I might get tired of this after dozens of plays, but right now I have a blast every time I play.

Update: A little tired after seven plays. It's great but too long to recommend in most situations. The one-status-max variant is recommended to keep everyone in the game, else it can really, really bog down.

Great family game. Don't bother strategizing, you'll just get frustrated. Instead, focus on creating a believable character and getting into his role, then enjoying the adventure.

This game is not about winning at all, because there's very little you can do to strategize. It's really about creating a story. 

Every turn you perform a small action and then you face a random encounter and decide how to react. How do you react to a crazy beggar? Do you hire them? Beat and rob them? Question them? Maybe they're a dethroned prince and you can help them or maybe they're just an old man. You really have no idea, but it'll be a great story. 

There's an android app to help you parse through the gigantic book of all these scenarios that's useful to have.

Never played the first edition copy I bought used. However, we broke out the Z-Man edition the moment we got it and simply started setting up and playing as we read through the rules... This game pretty much has it all: well-written and easily understood rules; engaging play; replayability; several paths to victory; lavish production. If you enjoy thematic, immersive games with great narrative  (Such as Star Trek: The Adventure, which is Tales' precursor) then you'll absolutely love this. Grand-Slam homerun for Z-Man!

At the end you can write your own story of the game which is very nice for some cool sessions reports.

I REALLY wanted to like this.  I was hoping to play it with my family.  Beautiful components.  Looks very nice.

2 problems
1 . its essentially a solitaire game where every turn you roll to see if you succeed in the space you enter.  You can easily spend a few turns in the same space.  You will get some good things here and there (treasures) and some curses.  Some of thos ecurses will really screw you, and you might never get rid of them.  Your decisions are worth little, except in some very obvious cases.  (dont drink from a poison lake).  I had a skill that I was a master at, I chose a course of action that emphasized it, in an appropraite situation, and got screwed.

2. It takes 2 hours!!!  Given its nature, if the game took 30-45 minutes I'd rate it a lttle better.

There was nothing really fun about it after 30 minutes.
It seems way outdated and there are much more fun games avaialable.
Its Beautiful, but far too long for a mediocre solitaire game.  Play someone elses copy one time, and you will see what I am talking about.  Also - too much down time with many players, but since its random and decisions dont matter who cares.

Is this a game?  It's probably better described as a way to pass time because it feels like the game is playing you.  Effectively, this is a race game with a lot of luck from cards and dice rolling.  With 5p, it took way too long to play.  Often you take a turn, accomplish very little, then wait 15 minutes for another turn.  In order to do well in the game, you need to have the correct "talent" tokens for random encounters; however, the talents (aside from starting talents) are usually obtained by chance or luck... and the talents that are helpful for a given encounter often do not make intuitive sense.  There are many other games that I would rather spend 2-3 hours playing.

Too bad that there are several confusing rules.  I don't get too caught up in the concerns about stories that don't quit fit the location, or even stories that seem to have contradictions already in them, but the rules about Wealth and Treasures and Statuses have a lot of unanswered questions in them.  It seems that less complicated Treasures and Statuses would be an improvement.  Definitely don't play this with more than 3 players... would take too long.

It breaks my heart to rate this a four. What an incredible theme. What a beautifully produced game. How beautifully the rulebook is written, with so much work and affection for the source material. As a game, though (at least one I'd like to play), it just doesn't hold together. The decisions just don't matter. It's "Choose your own adventure" in a group, waiting for each person to go until you finally make your decision. And your decision doesn't matter. You need to track the changes to your character. They don't matter. You need to keep track of cards affecting your character which don't matter either. My heart is completely in sympathy (empathy, even) with those who define "game" more broadly and present "Tales" as a storytelling game more than a strategy game. Here's the thing, I don't think it succeeds there, either. The paragraphs are too well defined and too specific to encourage the kind of narrative play that I've heard the game can promote. See "Once Upon a Time" for a more constructive option there. I hope one day I can find a niche for this game in my life as I'm strangely glad that I own it - I just can't get it to work as I wished it did.

Years back a friend who I don't see much of anymore brought this around one day.  We looked it over and fooled around with the Book of Tales for a fifteen to twenty minutes, but didn't really play the game.  The book fascinated me, so I kept it in the back of my mind as something to check for myself one day.

Now I have a copy and I understand why he didn't really want to get into back then.  This can be a lot of fun, but a full game seems to take about an hour per player.  And in the end, though someone wins, the outcome seems largely random.

Still I like it, not so much as a competitive game, but as a pastime when I got time to spare and have no particular interest in something else to do.

Fun, fun, fun.  This is the type of game you generally only take out and play through two or three times a year, but when you do it is just a blast.  Just don't go in expecting to formulate a grand strategy, or even a set of tactics.  This game plays you, and it does a grand job at doing so.  If that type of thing will bother you stay far, far away from this game..but if you've got people to play with who will not get upset being laughed at as they encounter misadventure after misadventure you owe it to yourself to try this one.  And don't worry..they will have their chance to laugh at you as well.

The first time I played it was some of the most fun I've ever had with a game.  The second time (with a different group) was one of the worst.

My only conclusion is, if everyone is playing to have a good time, they will.  If anyone is playing to win, nobody will have a good time.

For me, this one is a homerun, only ruined by the frustration of others.

Physically it's a beautiful game with top production values.  Playwise it's not much of a game at all.  You move your guy craw a card roll some dice and hope for the best.  Sometimes your choices can affect the outcome, more often they don't.  TotAN isn't so much a game but rather a group storytelling experience.  I find it boring but my wife and kids like it so I guess I'm stuck.  The game does get better with several beers however.

When no one was looking I was able to sell this very pretty but ultimately boring "game".

You have encountered an AMAZING TOME (Matrix Y).

Do you:
TAKE IT
USE IT
AVOID IT
BUY IT

"I'll BUY IT."

That's Matrix 4090: roll the destiny die.

"I rolled MINUS."

[b]4089[/b]
You encounter a strange arcane shop filled with many boxes painted bright cheerful colors.  One of the larger and heavier boxes catches your eye. It has a picture of a djiin and the legendary sailor Sinbad etched across the top.

NO SKILL: You look inside but do not understand the grandeur involved in the strange cardboard and large spiral bound book.  The shop keeper instead edges you towards Abstracts and Eurogames with defined goals and strategies. [S:1]

ENDURING HARDSHIP: A large man comes into the shop and says "Put that down, I had it on preorder."  He pays for it and quickly runs off. Not to be denied your prize, you follow him to an area with chairs and tables where other people await him.  They quickly punch out many cardboard chits and pull out a map of Arabia.  They pretend to be heros of myth, like Sinbad and Aladin.  They pass a large book around and dramatically roll dice in order to have numbers told to them by another of the gathering.  They seem to be enjoying themselves, but their choices seem to have little bearing on the outcomes of these short stories and one player seems to be constantly beating a Hunchback in order to try to escape from being in prison while another complains that being a sex-changed, beast-form, grief-stricken and married isn't making things very fun for them.  One of them eventually causes an event that makes them put everything back into the box to a chorus of 'good game'.  You walk away confused. [S:1, D:1, [i]Confused[/i] ]

STORYTELLING: You open the box and believe you have found the suitcase of Marcelas Wallace. Contained therein are colorful chits and a map of Arabia. A tome, weighing many pounds, has many thousands of paragraphs of entertainment and adventure to be shared with your friends.  You quickly empty your pockets and whisk this new found treasure to your next game meeting, where you accept the fact that you cannot control the fates, but are only along for the ride.  You delight in the storytelling, acting out the characters of an enraged djiin or a crazed beggar. Your friends enjoy themselves as well and are glad you made this purchase.  [S:1, D:1, W:-1 (no minimum), [i]Beguiled[/i]]

WEAPON USE: You draw forth your scimitar and slay the mighty dragon, shouting praises to Allah. A small green creature from outerspace chances upon you and says "I believe this paragraph is a typo and should have been #2583.  Sorry about that." [S:2, D:1, [i]Typographical Error[/i]]

Game is actually well-crafted.  I had no control or influence on how well I did, but it's not one of those kind of games.  I would characterize it as a Choose Your Own Adventure game put to a board game which is nice for a change of pace, but not a steady diet.

Wow. What an amazing first game.

This game is simply incredible. While there is a winner, everyone creates their own story as the game progresses. Destiny plays a role for all, and as one might suspect, destiny can be unpredictable.

I had this game in its original 1985 printing, and my Book of Tales was getting quite worn, so I was glad for the reprint. I played and played and played and played this, and now it's played out. Now I avoid bringing it to gaming nights because I'm sick of a) hearing all the other players hoot and holler as they read the Book of Tales for the first time and b) waiting until the building closes for a six-player game to finish.

This was certainly completely different than anything else we've played. It's actually a pretty impressively put together game, and you can tell a lot of careful work was put into developing it.

I ended up winning our first game, but I can't exactly say that I had much of a role in that happening. I suppose there are a few decisions to make (doing attack oriented things when you have a weapon, for example), but that doesn't always work out how you expect. So, it seemed pretty random to me, and 2 or 3 particularly good fortune events helped give me take a solid lead in the middle of the game.

It was fun seeing the stories develop, and the status cards really are well designed. I would certainly play this again, and would be interested to see how replayable it is. Initial rating an 8 due to quality and enjoyment, although as a competitive game it really can't be compared to other titles.

I enjoyed the old version of this game, and I found the new one to be even more fun after my first 2p game.  I can see the possibility of certain things getting repetitive (Jailer encounters if you're Imprisoned, for example), but overall, I found it delightful.  And that's after spending most of the game Fated, Insane, Imprisoned, AND Grief-Stricken, with only two skills, while my opponent (just Insane and Respected) had an amazing array of skills to work with.  But this isn't a game about winning and losing, but the story along the way, and I was delighted with the story we told.

In some ways, I wasn't expecting too much from this game, mostly because it was a reboot of an 80's classic (the reason I got it, never having played the original).  Those "classic" games from the 80s often are more fun to think about playing than to actually play  (I'm looking at you, Avalon Hill).  I thought it would be fun once in a while, a game to be played when the mood hits you, but which you wouldn't want to exhaust.  After more than a few plays, the game seems pretty well inexhaustible - we've hit repeat encounters a few times, and probably will hit them more the more we play, but really, they blended right in with the action.  Stringing together the episodes into a tale (of misery, usually, in my case) is fun and funny.  Ahhh yes, unless you've been a ravishing woman turned into a hideous ape, forced to wander, crippled, blind, and lost, infected with a horrible STD by a hideous hunchback, well, you might not know what I'm talking about.  The production values of this game are second to none, natch for Z-Man, and the game can be played quite handily in 90 min.  Yes, this has already hit the table more than I thought, and there are many mechanics you can control (subtle thought they be).  Get this game - now.  For around $35 at online retailers, you cannot go wrong.

RATING: 6.5
Utterly hilarious, ridiculous storytelling boardgame. It does remind me of those old choose-your-own-adventure books, as well as some of the old text-based computer RPGs I used to play as a kid. The events are arbitrary, players have little to no control over the outcomes of their decisions, and there is not even a hint of strategy or tactical decision-making, which obviously rankles some of the more uptight users on BGG. 

The game is meant to be experienced, however, not to be won. (If you play this game to win there is seriously something wrong with you). We were laughing so hard when my wounded, crippled, grief-stricken and insane hero tried to limp his way to complete his pilgrimage before having to head home to check in with his wife. Being married totally sucks in this game.

With that said, we were lucky to have finished in three hours. The game is just too long, especially because of the number of cards that prevent you from winning even when you have enough points. I love the idea of the game, I admire the amount of work that went into writing all of that text, and I definitely won't trade the game away anytime soon, but I will probably only play it a couple of times a year. We may try to shorten the game by setting the victory conditions a little lower.

RATING: 8
A very fun game if you get into the role playing aspect of it.  The one problem I have with it is that you don't seem to have any control over how your points get awarded to you.  Because of that, we now play that you only need to get 20 points total (you no longer need to predict how many of each type of points you will get.)  While I do enjoy it very much, it can go on a little long.

Amusing, but highly-random and takes a little too long.  Would be nice to have a soft copy of the paragraph book to speed things up a bit (paragraph number searching).

Fun for a bit, but looking up numbers and flicking through the book is tedious! Not to mention keeping track of half a dozen status cards per player. For once I wish there was an app...

A long standing interest was re-awakened by having recently read the book.  Very pleasantly surprised on a partial first play to see that play zipped round quickly.  It also confirmed my suspicion that this could be a very good game in the right circumstances but may fall a bit flat if not in the right mood.  I think this is a 9 or a 10 for me in the right circumstances. 

Having now played more, it certainly is; duly uprated.

RATING: 9
UPDATE: I do like this game a lot. But it's probably another game I am fated to like a lot more than most people who share most of my other gaming tastes (see also El Capitan).

After our last game, Kim had an intriguing suggestion for tightening the screws just a touch on this: start players with 4 or even 5 skills instead of 3. This would let players hit the ground running instead of having the slightly slow early game as it is, where players both can't accomplish too much until they get a break, and where some debilitating conditions can be quite nasty and lead you to end up being stuck.
---
I thoroughly enjoyed this game and felt like it did a ton of stuff right. I thought had good narrative arc, not just for the obvious reasons, but because players gained skill and wealth at a generally good clip, allowing them to develop and exert more control over the encounter matrices as the game went on. It wasn't too long, at 2 hours-ish. It's a bit mechanical with all the page-flipping, which is a bummer, but once you get into the groove it's not all that bad. And the stories are great.

But, and it's a big but, some of the statuses you can get stuck with really suck. Insane is good for a laugh for a few turns but gets old quickly. Ensorcelled is just awful and sucks the fun out of the game very rapidly. Scorned is a flavorful irritant the first time, but it seems to get handed out a fair amount and having to deal with it more than once also sucks. Maybe there is more control that you can exert if you are familiar with the flavor of the game, but you don't want to strip the players of the couple real choices they make each turn.

I think it also helps if you have some sense of the flavor of the game and what choices it is likely to reward.

We played with four, two of us really enjoyed it, two of us less so. A lot depends on whether you can feel like you are making some progress. Obviously, it's a somewhat random game, and if it works out that you can't, it can be not fun, especially given the length. 2-2.5 hours in 1985 was not a big deal, these days, it a little more on the outside edge. 4 players was decent, 3 is probably the sweet spot, and I would definitely not play with 5 or 6.

Regardless, I thought it was a lot of fun, was an evocative and flavorful game, and would happily play again. But it clearly won't be for everyone.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is such a hard game to rate!  I absolutely love it when I do play it, but then once I play it I'm pretty much done with it for a year until I want to play it again, and I'm even kind of tired of it by the time I finish the game.  I think it's because Tales is more of an activity than a game.  It's basically a choose-your-own-adventure exercise with points being semi-randomly distributed and stuff happening to you that you really don't have a heck of a lot of control over.  It makes for a really fun story telling experience although in the end, it's not really a game so much as an activity.  An activity that, for me, is great fun maybe once a year.

Sure, there isn't much "game" here. It's totally random and defies any strategies applied to it. You wander around the world, make choices in a "choose your own adventure" style,  and things happen.

However, this box is magical. The stories you will create are bustling with wonder and amazement. It's very difficult to explain, but the way the enormous storybook (filled with over 2000 different encounters) is designed so that every response to your choices makes sense...the fact that this game works at all is pure sorcery.

It's simple. It takes a few minutes to get it on the table and explain the rules. There's very little downtime since the game smartly gives three players something to do each round.

Reading about this I was extremely excited, however when I finally brought it to the table no-one was having fun. The random dice roll changes the players choice more often than allowing them to go in the direction they wanted. Even then the actual story takes wild twists and turns. While this is fun narratively we found the game lacked for a real goal. I had no real way to work towards collecting points/treasure etc other than hoping for the best. Several of the curse/negative attributes can ruin turns. We had several players basically unable to make decisions for multiple turns in a row which really put a dampener on their enjoyment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
SPECIAL NOTE: Make sure you house-rule the hell out of this game to add to the narrative and RPG aspects. If someone is stuck with a lousy status half of the game, think of a clever way to help them get rid of it; read in character; don't try to make the objectively 'best' decision, rather make decisions in character; play to fewer victory points; make great stories together. It's a unique board-game and unbeatable for what it does. A word of warning though: If you're all about maximizing and winning, this game may not be for you (I'm usually about maximizing and winning though, and I love it). And yes, it is random as hell, so enjoy the ride (and the crazy amount of work that went into the design.

After second play: I REALLY, REALLY like this game. It isn't a competitive 'game' in any sense that would satisfy a person who is looking for that sort of thing, but as a collaborative story-telling adventure it is unsurpassable. The fact that it adds some 'game' aspects to what is basically interactive story-telling is icing on the cake. If it covered a theme of more interest to me (Homeric Greece or Wild West or...the possibilities are endless), I would probably just pass-out into a drooly, orgasmic puddle. My game design retirement project: use this system to develop a game with an even cooler theme. Top 10. Love it. 

Great storytelling and tons of fun. I prefer playing to lower victory point totals, and perhaps giving each player an extra skill because it tends to drag (especially if you get stuck with nasty statuses that you can't shake--that's part of the fun though right?). It's very different from any other games that I've played and must be considered a cooperative storytelling-fun-rpg type of experience, rather than a competitive game; you're telling stories together. Given those expectations, and a lower winning totals to keep the playing time reasonable, I can't imagine a more enjoyable social game. Newbies should enjoy it a lot, just don't play with too many people (5 or 6 would drag I think) and consider playing to a lower point total. Fun, fun, fun creative story-making that is all about what you bring to it and make of it. I need more games like this (too bad there aren't any; so sad).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun storytelling game that works well with 4 or more.  Decent with 2, but the constant trading of the book of tales distracts from the storytelling aspect of the game since you can't sit and be absorbed in this otherwise beautifully thought out game.

After a few more plays, I still like the idea, but the game seems to drag on forever, even with a limit of 15 story/destiny combo

Sold for $40 via Kijiji

Re-bought for $55 at Game On! in Summerside since everyone likes it so much.

RATING: 4
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

This game is something of an oddity. Players don't have a lot of control, there's almost no meaningful decision making (especially since all skills are essentially the same), and no real player interaction... and yet it somehow manages to remain engaging, even over about two hours. You just want to listen in to other people's stories.

Lots of chaos and luck, so I could see how this could easily drag on.

Still if you don't mind a game that's less like a game and more like a group activity with fun storytelling elements, this is one of the better ones around.

I suspect this is best with 3 and that my rating would go up or down dramatically if I played again.

Not so much a game as a 'choose your own adventure' story for multiple players. Two or three would appear to be the optimum number as everyone has something to do. The matrices (1-120?) in the book should have been printed out separately as they will get a lot of use. Enjoyable to see how the tales unfold though the decisions are not based on anything substantial. It would have been good if there was a bit more of a description than just "serpent" or "con game" on which to base your decision. Amusing but overall quite random. Beautiful board and pieces. Writing the book must have been a real labour of love.

This is a game that does what it does rather well. However, you won't find a game that demands much of you as a player: decisions are limited and, in the case of encounters, usually based on a best guess. Still, the game moves along fairly quickly with four or fewer players, and the sheer quantity of potential encounters means that the stories won't grow stale too quickly. Take it for what it is, let the stories develop, do a bit of roleplaying, and enjoy the ride.

Choose your own adventure in boardgame form is quite fun.  I really like how everyone wins in this game just by experiencing it and actually winning is just the way to end the game.  In my first game, I got Lost and Enscorelled, tried to get with a hot princess only to have an Efreeti kill her first.  I had to go home to Baghdad then and got married to the ugly daughter of a princess to which we luckily had no children.  I then chickened out in the face of a gigantic Efreeti war.  Great fun!

Tales of Arabian Nights is a storytelling game, with a board and a massive "choose your own adventure" style book that drives the story. Theme, story, and flavor alone are not my cup o' tea, hence the low rating.

At the same time, I appreciate the tender loving care that went into this game. For someone who wants to watch the story unfold, I'm sure there's plenty to explore. And admittedly, player choices are not totally random... common sense does seem to be slightly rewarded (i.e. don't taunt an animal that looks threatening, don't "do nothing" in the middle of a storm, etc.). There's an audience for this game, but it's not me.

At least it's better than Talisman.

Find a group that likes the idea of a game that is more of a story than a challenge and then play this and have a wonderful night.  This game have a wonderful system to keep the table involved, 3 players being involves in everyone's turn keeps the table from wandering to their phones between turns as long as you keep the game to 3 or 4 people.  The stories feel great and you get invested in your character and there is so much choice that you feel you are them.  Can have some real bad luck, but that almost makes for a better story. After another play I feel this holds very true.  I believe the group you go into this with will determine how the game goes.  I recommend having fun in the reading of the stories, adds a layer well, I'd almost pass on playing the game if I got to just read all the stories dramatically, but so would everyone in my group.

This is a pretty silly game, if you like off beat stories.  There's not a ton of strategy to this game, it's just a fun one to play.  I have found it more helpful if one or two people are in charge of reading the book.

If you play to win, steer away from this one.  If you play to have fun, Tales of the Arabian Nights is an absolute must have.  While it is a story telling game, it doesn't exactly carry a solid framework storyline from start to finish.  It's a series of entertaining misadventures that aren't trying to melt your noggin.  Just ease back at the game table and enjoy whatever happens.

Awesome game to bring out if your game night is a tad light on it's attendance. I'd recommend playing to a smaller number of story/destiny points. 20 total is just too high.

Very fun paragraph style game (those old SPI/West End/Victory Games paragraph style adventure games are classics).  Very nice components and fun play if you take the bad events in stride.  The game definitely shines with a few house rules to smooth out some of the tougher status effects.

The ultimate choose-your-own-adventure. Almost relaxing to play. Winning is secondary. However your story turns out, it's a good time. 

Even with all the variety, there seems to be a good chance of repeating scenarios in any given game. Over time, one might be able to commit the best outcome to memory, taking the wonder out of it.

Not a whole lot of player interaction, but having others there to experience the stories with you creates interaction outside the game itself.

RATING: 8
This is less a game than an exercise in storytelling, although even the term "storytelling" is not quite appropriate, since it implies a level of control that this game does not permit.  The game itself is the story teller, so call it "story exploration" instead.  IMO this tracks more closely with what happens in Middle Eastern fables--characters in that genre generally are pushed out into the world, get clobbered by events fantastic and mundane, and deal with it as best they can through endurance and subversion.

You will like this game if you can handle absurdity with laughter instead of with frustration.

For a game with no real strategy at all, this one is still fun.  Kind of a multi-player fighting fantasy gamebook.  But, I really enjoyed gamebooks when I was younger, and this game captures that nostalgia.  Just due to the nature of having a book for the encounters, I think it will have limited replay value, but I imagine it will take quite a while to start seeing repeated patterns.  If you don't play it frequently - I'm sure it's not a problem at all.  I do feel like some of the Status cards are a little rough, though, and it seems more difficult to find treasure than I would like.  Getting treasure is fun, so it seems like you should have a good shot at getting one or two cards during the game, but that usually doesn't happen.  Personal preference, I suppose.

RATING: 7
Tales of Arabian nights is a great game, but it gets a 7 because it's not the type of game that I will always want to play.  

It's essentially a large interactive choose your own adventure story, which you're completing simultaneously with other players.  

The choices you make are more or less illusions, because while it may seem like a good idea to make one choice or another in a given encounter, you're never really sure of the outcome and things more or less just happen to you whether you want them to or not.  (Hey! Just like real life!)

Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable, albeit long experience.  It does have an enormous amount of replay value because there are various quests and story paths to pursue.  I imagine I could play this dozens of times and still come up with a different character destiny each time.  

What's a little odd is how the game is won under these conditions.  Eventually a player will accumulate enough story and destiny (victory points) to win the game.  Unless that player specifically had a random negative status assigned to them during the game, the other players pretty much can't do anything about it. 

So while the game is fun, in my view it loses points because there's less player interaction, cooperation, or competition.  In fact, the most interactive you get is just passing the story book and decision matrix tool around so that the players on your left and right help read the outcomes of your decision. 

Thus, this is not a high skill game or a way to flex your mental prowess.  It's a good for people who appreciate a good story, or kids, and you can laugh and cry at the luck and misfortune of your character and the others in the game.

Very much a story-telling American style romp. Very random. You do make choices, but those choices don't have much to do with your success or failure throughout the game. Fun theme. The game is helped by online tools if you can find them - would probably do well if they published an app version, as the original game has a little too much flipping around books.

However, there is not much gaming element. It is just a experience sharing with your friend, reading the hilarious moment with your fried.

Arabian Nights is the greatest game you'll never play, because it's inherently unplayable. It's not a game. Now if you're okay with it not being a game, it ranks among the better things you could be watching this evening with your friends. Remember when we heard that sports games and dramas would soon let you change the camera angle through your remote? That might be the best way to describe this. You'll have no real control over your story - you can make decisions, but very few of them have an impact, or at least the impact you want - and seeing who will end up winning is actually the point of the fun, rather than trying to win yourself. That's probably not making it sound too great, but trust me: try a "game" of it and you might get hooked.

Either you litterally roll on the floor laughing, or you have a "meh" experience if no good stories show up.

My funniest moment ever was when, due to being insane, my opponent choose what I was to do when I encountered a blind man. He choose that I should follow the blind man and as I did, I came upon a secret organization of blind men. Alas, I got caught and severely beaten. Only the fact that they were blind saved me from a certain death...

RATING: 3
I... really don't know what to make of this. I was very, very excited to pick this up, and I suppose I didn't realize this is almost a pure storytelling-based game with very little player agency. It really doesn't feel like you have a lot of control over anything that happens - things randomly occur and you choose and action to respond, which gets you another random event, and so on. I don't really mind that there's not much game to it (I enjoy Betrayal, after all), but the storytelling aspect seems so random, and sometimes simply doesn't make any sense based on whatever combination of circumstances you're in.

I need to play this more, and perhaps with more people, to get a handle on what I think about it.

Update: So, after playing this again, I decided that this really isn't for me. It feels like a "snakes & ladders" of storytelling, which removes any sort of intrigue or player agency. You can also fall into a state of not being able to do anything for quite a long time without any way out of it except for a random lucky draw. I do really like the idea of the game... the execution just isn't interesting enough for me.

This narrative-driven "experiential" game was much more fun than I expected. Its a little procedural in the constant looking up tables and paragraphs, but once you get into the routine of that the game flows pretty quickly.

The theme holds up extremely well. You're constantly making small choices, but for the most part your fate is out of your hands. There isn't a whole lot of direct character-character interaction, but it feels like there is plenty of player interaction because you look up and read text for the players next to you. 

The game provided lots of laughs, and ended just when it was starting to feel a little long. I would gladly play this again. I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes over with grade-school aged kids.

If you know anyone religious no matter if Muslim, Jewish, or Christian you will feel the familiar feeling of wrath of your monotheistic god old school style.  All kidding aside, its a fun storybook game that follows one of the characters in the Arabian Night stories that have been collected.  Prepare for a long night though as this seems to run 3+ hours with 4 or 5 players.  I have had shorter games but only when Allah had more pressing things to do then curse me.

You need to come at this game with a sense of humor. It's not even remotely fair. It's going to be randomly punitive. If you can laugh off being destroyed for doing something totally innocuous, you'll have a ball laughing at the silliness of the whole thing. Stay far, far away if you feel strongly that victory should result from clear, well-executed strategy.

RATING: 6
(Play with streamlining variants including only allowing 1 status at a time and playing to 20 combined score, min 5 in each to avoid cheese wins with a status that prevents scoring in one of them, no pre-game choose as it just slows the game down).

Tales of the Arabian Nights isn't really so much a game as it is an amusing activity with a board, a book, and some dice to spice things up. I can't really rate it highly as a game, because you really aren't making decisions that I would consider all that gamey at any point in the proceedings. Yes, you can make some choices based on their perceived value to your point scoring goals (if you play with those: I find the game random enough to make choosing them not worth the trouble, YMMV) but what happens is so up to the vagueries of fate that there isn't much point in thinking things out logically beyond the obvious things: like I have a lot of money or negotiation skills, so choices that might use those in resolution seem reasonably more likely to work.

So yeah, you wander Arabia, you have encounters, you read stuff out of the book, and eventually someone wins. It's not really role-playing per se, though you can definitely get into amusing story-telling mode if you're the reader. And it's not really gamey as there is usually an obvious path you should be taking to score points (i.e.: your quest). All of that said, I find it fun as a once in a while activity. That also said, the game can take a while, and if you play it with more than 4 you are going to be hurting for time. 

I think this also benefits from a GM type arrangement and I am generally willing to run the game for other interested players in that capacity, as I think a good story-teller with some familiarity with the game can both speed it up and make it more fun for casual players; this is particularly the case given the way I play it with only 1 status allowed, as there is room to come up with funny reasons why after encounter X you are no longer Y but are now Z. I would have also liked some more ways for the players to interact, but given that this is based on a very old title and how narrative driven it is I can understand the way it was formatted. Great flavour throughout and fun for what it is, though you definitely have to be in the specific niche for this to enjoy it at all.

This is a good purely thematic game best played with 3 or even 2 players so as to minimise downtime. As opposed to other storytelling games, it seems that your choices do have a reasonable impact on how the game plays out.

An interesting idea of an unfolding story but VERY little game involved here at all with massive amounts of randomness and little decision making...especially informed decision making. The storytelling side is so broken up by the taking of turns and the looking up of tables lists and readings.

This is not in the truest sense a "game" that you want to "win."  It's actually an experience for the group as the whole as you listen to tales of triumph and woe.  Perhaps you can work together to help solve each other's problems.  Or perhaps you'll set off on a solo quest.  The choices are truly yours.

This is full of so many stories and variations, it's hard to imagine getting bored with this game.  As a fan of "Choose Your Own Adventure" fiction as a kid, this tickles my fancy.  In a way it's an evolution of the party game - a big leap towards thematic games like Arkham Horror or BSG.

A lot of thought has gone into the design of this game and it really shows.  Worth its nearly 8# in weight!  The only negatives would be a little downtime when you're not reading or taking your turn, and the game can get quite long when you have more players or rotten luck.  But for a rainy day where you're not in a rush, who cares?

I've had fun with this once or twice. But it seems to be a see-what-happens experience - your decisions are certainly relevant (they affect the outcome of things) but rarely if ever meaningful (the linkage between "what you choose" and "what happens" seems incredibly unpredictable).

RATING: 7
It fails miserably as a game, as you have virtually no control over your ultimate fate. But as an activity it really is quite enjoyable, with a well-paced development arc and interesting emergent stories (like the time I decided to attack everything in sight, many djinns included, with my Master Weapon Use and got Beast Formed three separate times). This is really something you have to play with the right group; competitive players will find this distasteful, and it extends a bit too long for most players that don’t have a specific interest in adventure games. Three seems to be the right target number of this, too, as it minimizes downtime, with everyone having something to do on a turn.

Within that context, though, there are still some things that really nag. Quests are poorly balanced, with some completely up to the whims of fate, others so time-consuming as to take longer than a full game, and a few way too easy. Likewise, the method for advancing through time is broken; I can’t see how anyone could ever progress into night or even midday as written. But the most frustrating part is some of the statuses. It’s not that many encounters will randomly stick you with negative statuses, as this is simply part of the fun of the game; it’s that some of the effects they laden you with tend to suck the fun out of the game. An early Grief-Stricken robs you of even your limited choices for an hour or so; Sex-Changed prevents you from winning and is very difficult to get rid of; a lingering Ensorcelled is a real negative play experience; and so on. Alternative ways to lose these by paying story and destiny would have been a real bonus.

RATING: 8
Components: Attractive board, with a few tiny details to make it seem inhabited (including different symbols for the cities on different continents). Clear paths between locations. Quality cards. The Book of Tales is spiral bound and sturdy. This game would greatly benefit from an app to handle some of the randomization.

Experience: What a cool experience. There aren't any strategic choices, but there is a fair amount of deduction, as I try to interpret the situation and guess which reaction will lead to an encounter where I can favorably use my skills. However, the paragraphs need to have more skills available to them, as I seldom have an applicable skill.

Though the various encounters don't chain together very well, there is some carry-over in the form of treasures, statuses, skills, and quests. I'd like more of an overarching narrative.

The storytelling is a delight. Well-written passages, with a variety of circumstances. This is exactly what I was looking for when I came to it, to be immersed in a fun story. This game is so clever, and I am amazed at the care that went into its creation.

Some of the statuses are particularly harsh (Imprisoned, Sex-Changed); others are cumbersome to use (Respected). Treasures are seldom meted out. I like that the Quests, location encounter cards, and a few other mechanisms provide me geographic direction for where I should head.

Wow...just wow.  This one blew me away.  I was expecting really good and got really really really really good.  This storytelling game is asked for more times than any other game.  The only negative is that no matter what, the players have very little agency in what happens to them.

TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
Fun game that plays like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.  Very unique!

RATING: 7
Extremely innovative game -- a unique offering which has a lot of its value in storytelling, and in the one-of-a-kind nature of the gameplay. If you're looking for strategy, or for thoughtful decisionmaking to be rewarded, look elsewhere. If you like stories, semi-RPG frameworks, components that create feel and setting, you've found a game you'll like. We like the game, but could not replay this too often.

EDIT:
Just played again with a new gamer and it was fun as hell. Again it was heart-breaking to finish the game and end the experience. Once more I'm struck by the thought that some people just don't get it. I will NEVER get rid of this game.

My wife loved the 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books when she was younger so this seemed like a good idea for a Mothers Day present. The SUSD review also played a large part in the decision. We played this twice yesterday so this is an initial impression. 
It is great fun.
It is not to be taken seriously.
Feel free to laugh at the misfortunes of others.
Do not expect a strategy to work in any way shape or form,

A great game for the imaginative mind. A sort of board game version of a choose your own adventure book.

Excellent "game", but needs to be played with the right group. The truth is that this is not really a game, but a fun and interesting social experience where the game trappings are just a wrapper for the story-telling and -experiencing that is the heart of this title. The wrong group will argue about the rules and the lack of clarity about what to do with each situation where the right group will fill in all the holes with interesting story elements. True gamers will probably hate this game or, more likely, just won't get it all... missing the point. This is an excellent example of a social "game" that simply acts to add some structure to a fun social experience.

Play it for a fun relaxing story adventure. Like most tabletop RPGs this should be played for the experience and not as a competitive game between players. Far too random for a competitive game, but enough decisions alongside that randomness to provide for a fun hour or so of storytelling.

RATING: 7
At its core, its a disguised and very simplified racing game, while giving false pretense to the players that they have much influence over their impending fates.

But if played for the sake of discovery, to learn what happens next, it's an amusing way to pass the time. If you can tap the inner role-player in you and tell your inner gamer to give it a rest, it's worth "playing."

This is not a game.  I would rather go read a book that may have a decent plot than deal with this garbage again.  I am moving my rating up (to a 2 from 1) due to the fact that this game is playable.  That doesn't mean it would stop me from getting up and leaving whatever situation I was in if I ever saw this game again.  I do want to make the point that if you are reading this and thinking about purchasing the game, be prepared that none of your decisions will matter, the game is 100% luck, and it won't make you smile or laugh.  Trust me, trade or buy a different game.  Go to Wal-Mart and buy a cheap romance novel, you will get more enjoyment out of that.

My issue with the game arises from the way you win: you must hit 20 points in the combination of the Destiny/Story points that you chose. So if you choose 13 Destiny and 7 Story [i]and[/i] you eventually hit those numbers, you win. (very simplified)

This is all well and good. But to me, there was something weird about this mechanic. Basically you are unable to control where the points go, they are dictated to you and almost impossible to foretell which answer will get you which points.

So, as I said above, I've been thinking and took some things into account.

1) The day/evening/night markers. Sag told us (stormseeker75 and I) that he had never seen anything but the day be used and even commented along the lines "I have no idea how you can even get to the next marker, perhaps 6 player."
2) The sheer number of [destiny cards] - I can't remember what they are... but every player receives one and gives you some idea of what to do in the game.
3) The choice of the winning combination. There was no way to insure you getting more story if you needed it or vise versa.

My conclusion:

I'm wondering if a mistake has been made in dealing out the Destiny/Story points. (not by the game we played but in general)

When you complete an event successfully on the paragraph it might say:

+1D/+2S/+2W (which translates +1 Destiny point and +2 Story points and +2 Wealth)...

I wondering if it should really read: +1 Destiny point or +2 Story points or +2 Wealth.

This fixes an issue I had, namely being able to choose where your points go.

It would make the game go significantly longer... very much so [i]but[/i] it would be able to use all three of those time markers that I commented about above.

It is still a 8.5 for me though... simply great game.

I have had a great deal of fun with this game, and have friends for whom it is their first-choice game.

Interesting game. However not one I would like to play all the time. Some things that bother me is how much being grief stricken can pretty much ruin the game if it hits you early enough. Also I guess it makes sense but the downside to cripple isnt nearly bad enough to counter the good side, which to me makes it an amazing negative status. The main thing is the game takes to long for me to want to play it all the time.

The game happens to you as much as you play it, and fumbling with the book and charts is a chore, but I must admit that it was one of the most thematic game experiences I've had in quite a while.   This game is polarizing, I know a lot of people that hate it, and just as many that love it.   I'm right in the middle.   There's almost no strategy (besides selecting actions that align with your skills), and you need to find the right mix of players.  But if you find the right combination, it can be fun.   Don't play with more than 4, and keep the game moving by having multiple people looking up results.

Players wander around most of the world encountering adventures.  Unique game where spaces combine with a card deck, die roll, and reaction choice to trigger an paragraph of adventure text from an enormous book of Tales.  This may instantly resolve, or lead you onto further adventures.  Adventure outcomes usually grant talents (good) and status (not always good), as well as treasure, destiny points and story points.  Destiny and Story are what you're trying to obtain to win back in Baghdad.  Fun game that really plays you.  If you're not prepared to strap in and enjoy the ride, you will hate it.  Otherwise, good fun.  The Z-man edition has to be the heaviest game per cubic centimeter in my collection.

RATING: 9
A heavy game box containing high quality materials: map board, booklets, player aids, playing pieces and lots of cards. The map portrays our world along with places found in the 1000+1 nights’ fairy tale. Each player selects a character and chooses in secret how many points of Story and Destiny points will need to achieve his goal. Then he gets a mission and he is on his way to fulfill it. After every movement, each player reads a huge book and tries to find out an event that occurs to him taken from the famous fairy tale. Upon finding the event he has to take an action. The action has to be based on the logic of the fairy tale event. If successful he gets Story or Destiny points, if not, he can be jailed, transformed into another being by a wicked wizard, get enslaved, diseased, blessed, crippled, pursued, mad etc. Also during his adventures a player can upgrade, master or lose skills that might be useful in a future unpleasant encounter. Along your travels you can use magic carpets, teleport and find magic places. The game ends when a player has managed to reach the points he has secretly assigned. Fun, interactive and recreational.

RATING: 2
For me, to qualify as a game, you have to make decisions.

A decision at its minimum involves at least knowing a probability distribution of outcomes.

This was an illogical choose your own adventure where a paper towel has as much of a chance of winning as you do.

With 5 people, it just dragged on and on and we cut it way short.

Travel the ancient world having exciting adventures and enduring terrible hardships.  With a well-written novel-sized book containing 2,600 paragraphs describing what is happening to your character, there is a nearly endless variety of things that can happen to your character, from marrying a rich princess and becoming Sultan to being crippled and turned into a woman.  The game is mostly luck, but as long as you can relax and enjoy the ride it's great fun.

This is a very special game. For one, it has not much like a goal or a winning condition. Sure, the rules tell you that the player doing this and that has won in the end, but it doesn't really matter. Second, the fun really comes from the stories, the players make up, and their imagination. The stories the game presents you are often very random and sometimes boring or make no sense. The choices you make often have very little impact on the results of the encounter.  So it's the task of you, the player, to fill in missing pieces and create a fun story. Really, really, really depends on the guys you play with.

This isn't your standard "game" but more of a fantastical story that is told thru the use of a board, cards, dice, tokens, and a thick book - and that's rad if you ask me.

Theme to the extreme.  :D

WARNING: A functioning imagination is absolutely, I repeat, ABSOLUTELY required to enjoy this game; so if you don't have one - don't even bother.

It's not very solitaire friendly...  I have a hard time docking points for that in this case though, since this is more of a "story created thru shared imaginations" than a game - other imaginations are inherently over 75% of it.

Incredibly easy to play and incredibly random, however this story driven game is absolutely fantastic.

Each player travels around completing quests in a choose-your-own-adventure story. There's a gigantic story book of paragraphs that the players reference depending on the situation. You encounter a situation, decide what you want to do, and see what the outcome is.

Everyone should have this game in their collection.

A choose-your-own-adventure style game that has a lot of detail.  There are thousands of paragraphs, which is pretty impressive.   Turns play out like isolated vignettes, but they don't quite connect together into a larger narrative arc, which is somewhat unfortunate.  The board and scoring of story/destiny points is almost unnecessary, and that's where I think Talisman can be a better experience.  In Talisman, the board matters, and the character building is more over-arching and relevant to the state of the game, and there is more drama at the end.  Tales ends anti-climactically. Still, this game delivers on its promise and is a one-of-a-kind experience and a very creative game.

This is such an enjoyable game/experience with people who want to just sit back and tell a story because, that is essentially what you are doing.

I'm always up for a game of Tales. We never play with scores, but just play until we think it's time to go home or do other stuff. I once played a session of 4 hours with a friend till 3 in the morning, and we only stopped because we thought it was a better idea to go to bed.

This is a great experience, usually. There have been some very memorable experiences and stories from this game, but there's also been overall a sense of it living past its prime. Without any way to really plan or do anything that impacts your character it mainly comes down to who just gets lucky. Which in an of itself isn't bad, until the game starts to drag on past the one hour mark. This is something though that I recommend everyone trying at least once because it is very unique and very colorful.

We counted the effects of the status cards--whether their effects were positive, negative or neutral.  It broken into something like 4 positive, 8 neutral, and 16 negative.   That wasn't fun to me or my guest, although we loved the mechanics of the game.

Love the idea - would like the character skills to guide encounters rather than being essentially random/irrelevant; so, tempted to play some more to see if the immersive 'roll with the story' aspect clicks, or if I'm just too much of a role-player...

Straight from the eighties, this is not even a game but more of a "choose your own adventure" book to play with friends.

It's totally random, there's no strategy nor 'clever choices', but usually the stories that build around your characters are so funny and absurd that with the right group you're gonna have a lot of fun.

Not everybody is gonna like it, but it's a little gem in its own right.
Note: there's a lot to read.

RATING: 4.65
Wonderful idea and amazing hard work which made me long for this game until I finally bought it. Sadly it was really disappointing. I admit I had more fun the more I played it, but mostly thanks to the people I was playing with who accepted pointlessness of the game and joined the ride. There is no game here. Nothing you decide to do makes sense in the end. There is no way that you can influence whether you will get Story points or Destiny points in your stories so there is no actual competition and points don't matter. But it lasts long, too long for what it is. I really wanted to love this game, but there so many better options I traded it to my friend in the end, and he loves that game so I got that going for me, which is nice.

I was crippled, insane, and enslaved, so I had to move slower, was unable to choose my actions, and had to give away my treasures (which I never got any of) and my much-needed Destiny points.  I felt more like a leaf in the wind than a player of the game--it played me!  Oddly, I enjoyed the experience enough to want to play again.  Weird, huh?

I would recommend 3-4 players.  5 just takes too long.  You need at least 3 to operate the book + chart with enough efficiency.

Getting a copy from a friend. Played twice so far. Needs to be played with 2-3 characters, no more. 4+ game takes way longer.

Not for everybody. That said, it`s a game for me. I simply love it.

Role playing. Better if one person does the game master and reads for everybody.

Great when the person who reads, gives a performance. It adds to the gameplay.

Probably as close to choose-your-own-adventure as you can get in a board game. A bit like Eldritch Horror in that your character can get very messed up.

AKA "Schadenfreude with Scheherazade"

Played once and oh my goodness this is fun -- a great combination of a storytelling game and a "choose your own adventure" book, maybe with a little of Arkham Horror's overproduced joy. Get lost, imprisoned, married off, and turned into an ape all in one game. Don't expect to have some big strategy. Just adventure around and laugh at the misfortunes of others and they're going to laugh at yours.

Some of the statuses (statii?) are a real drag though (You can't win if you've been sex-changed and the only way to fix it is to get another sex change? Nuts to that.)

Also, the ramp-up time can get a little frustrating: you flounder around for a bit until you can start getting slightly better results in encounters. The next time we play I'll probably take some suggestions here and start with four or even five skills for each character.

RATING: 5
I like Arkham Horror because it tells an interesting story and winning is not the primary goal of the game, however I wanted something that doesn't take as long to play and set up. Along comes Tales of the Arabian Nights. The game offers a rich story, however I find the rich story (Matrix N and Places of Power) will only happen if you or one of the other players randomly happens to have the correct skill relating to your encounter paragraph(s) or when a player randomly gains a treasure. There is very little game play and it's so random that playing to win is very pointless, but this is pretty much expected from a choose-your-own-adventure game. I think this would be a good gateway game for people too shy to play a pen & paper RPG. That being said, if you want a good story you would probably be better served reading a book or playing an RPG. If you want a game with story elements Arkham Horror would probably be a better choice than this since there is much more game play and strategy involved.

The components really left something to be desired when it came to functionality. The primary example would be a full flat worth of tokens to set your secret goal of Destiny and Story points. It's suggested you place them under your mat which is kind of silly, when pen & paper is quicker and more convenient. 

The extra flat could have been used for more skill chits because some of the skills only have 3 chits but the game plays up to six. I don't think it would be unrealistic to have 6 players get Piety throughout the game which means that multiple players would need to record this on a sheet of paper. I guess it's not a huge issue because I would never play this game with six but you still could run into this issue with less than 6. This same issue exists with having only 4 of any given status.

As for the Book of Tales, it has great stories in it, but why God, why did Z-Man choose a coiled spine?!  There are just so many things wrong with a coiled spine.  I also think the Encounter Charts in the beginning of the Book of Tales should have been separated into it's own chart reference like the Reaction Matrix. If they had decided to do it this way, it would allow 4 people to do something every round.

As mentioned earlier, I find the Places of Power and Matrix N encounters (if a character has the proper skill, so they can read up to about 5 or 6 paragraphs in a row) to be the most entertaining aspect of the game. The unfortunate thing is that these Place of Power encounters don't happen nearly enough in a given game and if they did, they may become old. People will be given Matrix N encounters more frequently than Places of Power, but usually will not have the proper skills to get multiple story paragraphs in a row.

Overall, this is a fairly enjoyable experience. Initially, I had great fun at the variety of the encounters and laughing at other people's misfortune with their negative statuses, but eventually it got a little old. I think this will be an amazing game for the right individual, but for me it's an average game with some poor component choices.

RATING: 6
Okay - I had a bad first game - being imprisoned for more than half the game and constantly being grief stricken (even with a 3 round house rule) whilst everyone else ran around and did things. It seemed interesting, but very, very random. And I get the feeling the random may be lost when you've played it a number of times. Still interesting.

RATING: 7
It took me a couple years, but I finally broke down and played Tales of the Arabian Nights, a game on the opposite side of my taste dial. As it was explained to me, it was more of an experience than a game, and this is a good thing it didn't muck this up game mechanics and rules.

Essentially it is a choose-your-own-adventure book with a convoluted randomization system to get you to the next chapter. Mechanically each chapter (turn you take) just adds 0,1,2, or even negative points to your score, so the winner of the game is the one to be lucky enough to choose the right path. Meaning, don't play this is looking for any strategy.

As a story driven social experience it does a great job. I played Time Stories last year and was wishing for a stroke to take me out of my misery, Arabian Nights moved quickly, did not require too much reading (for those who are shy), and did weave a memorable story.

Fantastic production quality.  Four player game seemed way too long and many of the encounters ended up with debilitating effects that sucked the fun out the encounters.    I can see why this game resonates strongly with some but I’m just not one for "choose your own adventure" games I suppose.

I enjoy it well enough but this is wholly dependent upon who you're playing with, and how of you there are (3 max).  The downtime between turns is marked and with too many players this can really drag.  Can be a lot of fun but my rating reflects my desire to never seek it out in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is very much an experience game - there is some skill involved, based on picking the best response to an encounter - but overall, things do happen and you can end up in a bad way through little fault of your own. It's not a competitive game either. The players are there more to share in your experiences than to compete and that's really the fun of TotAN. It's all about the theme, story development and just plain old adventuring! 

Nevertheless, things must be kept moving and downtime kept to an absolute minimum if this game is to work. Repetitiveness and downtime is the killer for games like these. 2 hours is the limit. Anything longer and the game enjoyment will head on a downward spiral. Thus, 4 players is the absolute upper limit, and it will help if everyone is into the theme.

I don't completely agree with the "Always want to play it" part of this rating, because you really have to be in the right mood for this game.  A few beers helps.  In any case, it doesn't get much better than Tales if you are looking for a story game.  Would love to see a Cthulhu or Space version with stronger gameplay behind it.

I've only gotten through one full game so far. The theme is fantastic and the mechanics of the game are sound. It's the play length that keeps this from hitting the table more than it has so far. It's hard to commit more than a couple of hours to playing something in our house.

Hands down one of my favorite games. Heck, it's not even a game, it's more of an experience, especially so if people are invested in each other's stories. The interaction between players in the base game is rather minimalistic though, so I do recommend playing the Storytelling variant (available on the publisher website) for an engrossing experience unlike any other. But even in the normal game, this game is fantastic and truly unique. I cannot fathom why there's no expansion.

Choose-your-own-adventure and storytelling element makes this a lot of fun!  Very fun game!  Some minor issues: 
* Best with 2-3 players. with 4 or more down-time can start being an issue.  
* Replayability is a minor concern, some events happen quite often (e.g. Imprisoned) and kids can memorize some results, but overall you'll get your money's worth out of this game before you're tired of it.
* The stories and the game do have a decidedly Islamic flavour at times
* Rulebook does need some clarification [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/489237/why-do-i-have-more-rules-questions-about-this-game]at times[/url]
Overall, my kids have really enjoyed this immensely however.  

Suggested house rules:
- Rather than pick separate Story/Destiny points, have a cumulative total for players to aim for, e.g. 20 points.
- Divide Encounter deck into three parts, and use Morning, Noon, and Night for each (or use the Destiny dice to decide which it is).
- Allow a win when [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/426429/sex-changed-now-evil]sex changed[/url].

RATING: 3
Quite disappointed with this game. The matrix system is a bit fiddly so you end up wasting more time looking up tables/pages/matrices in different places than enjoying the game. The more people you have playing the longer it lasts and more boring it becomes as you wait longer for your turn. It discourages you from calling more people to play together. There's practically no player interaction and there's nothing to do if it's not your turn. The artwork and play pieces are very nice and so is the story, but since story is all you get out of this, I'd rather read a book than play this again.

Very nice narrative game. The randomness is part of the package, so if that's a hang up for you, this isn't the right game. Actually moves a little faster with 3 than with 2 and great in a group of 6 (especially if you play to 15 combined points rather than 20).

See Chris Farrell's comments on this game.  I couldn't put it better. We all really enjoyed reading the text and getting a chance to do silly voices, calling "places!" before reading the story, etc. but it can be a fun game or a drag depending on the status you get stuck with. In my one play, I had fantastic luck and I had a *great* time, but I saw other players not quite having the romp to victory that I did and that could very well be me next time. 

I think Chris' suggestion to start with more skills is a good idea b/c if you get off to a bad start, you're most likely doomed. More skills would give you a better chance to manage some bad luck.

UPDATE: Played a 2nd time with a different group of people and we called the game about midway. Just didn't go over well with them.  Definitely a niche game for the "right" group.

Hilarious game to play with some friends, if they are up for the challenge of constantly flipping through the enormous "Book of Tales" (The phone app helps a bit but not really). The only problem I have with it is that there is absolutely no strategy to the game. Stuff just happens and you gotta deal with it. If, be some miracle you gain enough points to win you start making your way back to Baghdad and that's it really.

A fairly interesting storytelling boardgame. The decision-making is fun, but not overly interesting. Mostly a lot of blind guessing for the sake of potentially funny outcomes, or cool rewards. I like that choosing skills has a chance to make story elements more rewarding. The point system is a pretty arbitrary way for tracking who is "winning" the game, but all it really does is makes it so the game ends in some reasonable amount of time. In the end, it doesn't offer the type of game play that I truly enjoy in modern gaming, but it was an interesting experience. I can appreciate the amount of work that went into making the huge book of potential story outcomes, though.

Be prepared for a lot of bookkeeping. This game plays more like an Ian Livingstone adventure novel than a boardgame and while some adventures may be fun and zany the game can potentially lock a player out with some of its more punishing status effects. Patience is advised though frankly I'd look for my emergent story moments elsewhere in a game that rewards investment beyond a series of random paragraphs.

Very pretty and seemingly endless gameplay combinations. Somehow the game manages to sneak in the same encounter twice in a single game though. Also, don't play to win.

Oh I came from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where they cut off your ear
If they dont like your face

And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right

Stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another arabian night

RATING: 6.5
Very nice production, nice components, good flavour, but the usual teeny tiny fonts that make you squint. The mechanism works well, but despite winning, I felt that the rich got richer, and conversely, it was near impossible to get out of some situations (one player was sex-changed and so could not win until somehow they got changed back - practically an impossible task). The texts generally worked very well, only a couple of incongruous matters, but mostly it was good. Difficult to decide which responses would work, but we became bolder as we went along. I found the movement quite limited, which reduced my enjoyment as I'd have liked to explore more. I never competed my first quest, whereas my friends all got through a few each. Also, the game was three hours with 4 players, and little downtime.

On balance therefore, I wouldn't buy this myself and I'd be wary of joining in a game on a club meeting, but if you like 3 hour games with a good flavour, then shell out the bucks for this one. I didn't dislike it, but I could have been more entertained.

A game about telling stories. There's eventually a winner, but it's not really a competitive game. This isn't for everyone, but if you're just looking to sit back and tell stories while watching your character's story unfold, this game is a masterpiece.

Not a game as such. Very intriguing, would like to play with more people. This is the game that is defined on the group you play with. Know anybody that's into amateur dramatics or is a budding novelist? Get them into your group and I'd imagine this game could be awesome. I enjoyed my only play but struggled to come up with ideas for the story.

RATING: 6
I like the educational aspect of the game including the basis for the map. I like how the game can be modified in many different ways to vary the length or complexity of the game.  I like how everyone sets their own secret goals for winning.  I haven't figured the odds, but playing the same game twice is virtually impossible.

The game is attractive and the components are very nice.  Although an expensive game, you get a lot of value for your buck.

There was a lot of down time reading--but the short paragraphs are often humerous and well done.  Since there are a thousand different paragraphs, there is very little repetitiveness.  If I enjoyed games with a lot of text, this game would have rated much, much higher with me.  

If you are a poor reader and don't enjoy reading, this game is not for you.  Middle school reading level and up shouldn't have a problem.

This is one of my favorite games, and I've been playing it for years. It's sort of like those Choose Your Own Adventure books I read when I was a kid. You go around adventuring and getting in different encounters, which have different outcomes based on your skill set. This can also can be successfully played as a solo game, and I have done so many times. (However, the official solo rules that you can get online obviously were not play-tested very much, so you probably have to tweak them and make your own house solo rules.)

Seriously good for what it is, which is just what it sounds like - a choose your own adventure on a board.  There's really no "game" to it, but it's really quite enjoyable.  There no strategy, but it's fun to interact in the story.  It would seem like a fantastic family game, though I would warn that as my first action I mercilessly beat a dying hag.  If your children aren't a-holes, they'd probably never even realize this possibility existed.

Betrayal at house on the Hill does some things better, but on the whole this is definitely the better "game" and more fun throughout.

It is a unique experience that is probably not meant for everybody, but certainly capture the feel of those great Choose Your Own Adventure books from my childhood.

Very fun game - more like collective "Choose your own adventure" than a regular game.  Lots of fun, lots of laughs.  It reminds me of Arkham Horror, only the text is so much better written that you can have fun with the story that unfolds, rather than just worrying about the game mechanics.  

I would probably rate this higher except for two things - the text on some of the cards is EXTREMELY small, we found them very difficult to read sometimes.  Also, there is very little player interaction, other than laughing at the silly situations everyone is getting in.  More player interaction within the game story would have made it more fun, I think.

Other than those 2 little things, this is a super fun game and I hope to get to try it again!

I need to try Above and Below or its sequel.  I have this feeling they would completely replace this game.

I (as Ali Baba) ended up on the far side of the map on the first turn after having saved a village.  They erected a statue of me and a woman fell in love.  I welcomed her advances, but avoided entering cities lest she force me to settle down.  At some point I was gifted a hairless ape by a djinn, and cursed by another djinn.  On my way to trade the ape for transport to Baghdad, another player stole it.  I finally made it to Baghdad, where I tried to help an imprisoned princess and found myself in jail.   I managed to eventually talk my way past the guard - I was exceptionally good-looking, after all - and finally settled down with my wife in Baghdad, ending my turn there to win.

I'm not really sure of the point of the pre-game story/destiny point selection.  You don't seem to have much impact on whether you get story or destiny points during the game.  As such, it's hard to see what import the choice has beyond simply handicapping yourself if indeed we can expect story and destiny points to accumulate at roughly the same rate.  For this reason, we all played with 10S/10D as our choices, and I will probably continue to do this in future plays.

Had a ton of fun with this one so far.  It's a different kind of game, not meant to be taken so seriously with regards to winning and losing.  The way I see it, as cheesy as it sounds, everyone wins at this game because the stories are so entertaining.  There are some unclear rules issues, though, which keep the game from getting a higher rating.

Absolutely recommended, though you'll need to houserule a bit.

Haven't played many times yet but the sheer amount of choices and options to explore is brilliant! You have to play with a like-minded group of people though.

After 2 plays, it has not gone very well.  This would probably be fun with someone who was really into it and we could laugh a lot.  First 2 plays did not reach that point.  It tells interesting stories, I guess, but lack of meaningful decisions is a big negative.

You have to know what this is going in.  It is more about revealing a story than a more traditional game.  (Hence the huge book of paragraphs.)  Sometimes bad things (or good things) happen to you just because, and sometimes your decisions have very unexpected consequences or don't seem to matter at all.  Ok with that?  Then you might have a lot of fun.

RATING: 1
As cute as the game can try to be, gameplay itself is a crapshoot.
Players wander around a board, attempting to solve individual goals (with as limited a player interaction as that implies) while making nearly random guesses at actions to perform in encounters before they are told what happens. Players can't control their accumulation of points or even what statuses they pick up, particularly troubling as the game can grind to a total stand-still from a combination of statuses or limited acquisition of points.
Even if we assume that players can simply enjoy "the experience" of the thing, that is even hamstrung by the massive number of tables. Each turn starts with looking up how far you can move, then moving (which is either arbitrary or automatic based upon your current quest), drawing a card, cross-checking the space, adding together your modifiers, going through the book of tales, rolling the dice, picking a reaction (which is largely arbitrary based upon your quest and skills), looking it up in the reaction matrix, rolling the destiny die, flipping through the book of tales again, and finally you get a paragraph of text randomly burped at you by the book of tales and maybe the choice to use a skill if you have a relevant one. There are five minutes of bookkeeping for every two minutes of play!

If you are looking for a strategy game, pass on this one.  This is all about narrative and F-U-N!  The rules are very simple and really easy to teach.  The Book of Tales literally is the game here and the stories are wonderful funny and sometimes just downright hilarious!  Sometimes it is the person in last place (because they are sex-changed, beast form, cripple) that have the most fun.  What other games can say that?

RATING: 6
This is really fun even using the printed solo variant. The interesting part is you never know what is going to happen with each encounter. The more you play the game to it's end, the more powers you get, and the more things you have to mess around with. It's just plain fun to take your time and . At one point a had a magic lamp I could rub and I had a choice of things to choose from to help me along the way. This would be fun for multiple players too and even if you lose the game, it's interesting. You have to be willing to read a lot of cards and short paragraph stories out of a book of encounters.

I suspect after a few plays of this game it might get somewhat stale when you begin to see the same pieces of stories appearing from the book. I think it's only good for so many plays. The differences won't be enough to make it a life time game for you other than to introduce it to someone that's never played it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome piece of work, but needs very relaxed conditions to be played - lots of time and comfy chairs, and maybe some wine.

After 4 plays, I'm convinced there's something in there. If you choose to play a seductress character, and choose seduction skills and seduce when you can, good things will happen to you. If you choose a seductress character with irrelevant skills and attack when you can, it won't work and bad things will happen to you. 

There's often a way out of the bad things. If you're wounded, rest and get rid of it. If you're imprisoned, you need to figure out how your character can defeat the jailer. If you're lost, become hopelessly lost and get over it. Don't keep the bad statuses around - take active steps to remove them.

The key to succeeding in this game is believing that you can make a difference, no matter how random it seems. As far as I can tell, it's an awesome design achievement.

Atmospheric adventure game set in fantasy Arabia in Tales of 1001 Nights. Perhaps designed for non-gamers and kids in mind; I find it too random to be fun.

Pros:
- very thematic
- creates funny, evergreen stories
- good introduction to some of the RPG mechanics, like character evolution and decision making
- beautiful art on the board, on the cards and in the books.

Cons:
- lack of real player interaction
- stories don't always make sense. Stories are not always epic.
- very few interesting decisions. It is more about listening to a story unfolding rather than actually influencing it, as the consequences of your decisions are most of the time quite unpredictable.

Fun for telling stories, though it can also drag, particularly near the end. I recommend house rules to make the game go by more quickly. That said, you may have a rollicking good time, or you may have more of a "meh" experience, depending on any number of factors. 

My own house rule I've settled on is using any combination of Story and Destiny points to reach 20, i.e. you don't choose your own combination at the start, just forgo the tokens and whoever has a total of 20 points and gets back to Baghdad with a successful encounter wins the game.

Places of Power are hard to get to, and treasure cards are hard to come by. I do wish they came up more often.

Update: My group still enjoys this game and asks for it. We're just a bunch of story-readers and story-tellers, I suppose. Nobody ever minds the sheer randomness of it.

Wow, what a fun adventure. I can't wait to play again. Zman did an excellent job with the components on this game. This is a totally unique and fun experience.

Do note though that this is more of a fun sit down adventure with friends game than it is a competition to win type game. In fact losing is just as fun as winning most of the time.

If you remember and loved the Choose your Adventure books from your childhood. Than you will most likely fall in love with this game. It is just a really fun time with friends.

Also, there are some mildly adult situations that can arise through out the game. So, please take this into consideration if thinking of playing this game with children.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is extraordinary. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure novel but with so many more options and the story is so much more enjoyable because you share it with your friends.
Of course, luck plays a MAJOR part in this game. If you have the ill fortune to become grief-stricken, that usually takes away your chancce of winning. Not being able to use your skills really sucks. If you are really unlucky, it is possible that you are effectively not participating in the game anymore because the other players get to choose where you go, who you encounter and how you react. For these reasons, I totally understand if other people don't like this game. 
To me, the experience is unparalleled and because the stories are so unique each time, I simply love this game and luckily my friends do too.

I really like this game, as you know it usually a paragraph system, there isn't any combat like Ambush! and its not very strategic and doesn't really reward your choices.  But what is amazing is the paragraph book which is huge and many games are just plan fun to see what happens to your character.  The game isn't lacking and decisions, its just many of your decisions lead to unpredictable results (I actually think the results do have a pattern in tune with the Arabian Nights stories.)  Its great fun with other people, its not a game for everyone, you need to be someone who daydreams a lot.  And that someone is me!

You need to have the right group to play this - no one too concerned about "winning" since it is basically a multi-player choose-your-own-adventure game.

Probably plays best at 3 or 4 players since any more would seem to have a lot of down-time between your turns.

RATING: 6
If you're playing to the full 20 points (destiny + story) this is an hour per player. You must absolutely submit to the story, because you often have very little control - to the extent that it's not really a game, more of an interactive story. But if you're in the right frame of mind there are many laughs to be had.

I like the idea of Z-Man's PvP variant - seems a good way to add a thin veil of strategy, and also gives more options for getting rid of very difficult statuses like Sex Changed. But having tried it I'm tempted to house rule even more (and more positive) opportunities for interaction between players.

Some seriously quality stuff inside, with a simply massive tome for the book of tales, and a beautiful mounted game board. The box itself is practically bullet proof. Z-man really delivers on the quality vs. price for sure. The only complaint about the components I can make is that the finish on the cards is a bit thin, and looks like it's going to wear out fast. My board is also warping slightly the longer it's sat in the closet. other than these two minor gripes, the components are really, really nice.

The game looks easy enough to play, and offers a great amount of replayability. This one looks like it'll spend lots of time off the shelf, as the Lady and I both enjoy adventure games, and the fact that this one is purely story-telling is a nice change in what normally constitutes an adventure game. ie. killing monsters, levelling up, and getting treasure.

The game is a very unique, and really tells you a neat little story. I assumed there would be a lot more descriptive text in the paragraphs, and my adventure as Sinbad seemed a bit lacklustre.
That said, it's a really fun game with a lot of replayability. I just don't think it had enough suspenseful moments or action for my personal tastes. 

I also found the constant page-flipping to be a bit of a pain, and the encounter tables printed on a sheet like the matrices would have been much easier to use.

A really good classic, unique board game experience.
Get this game if you seek something different with a lot of theme and a great deal of charm.

This is a story telling game that uses elements from 'Choose your own adventure' and dice rolling.  The dice rolling kills it for me, it's fine for randomization, but several players got 'Ensorceled' and couldn't make the opposed die roll to break it.  This actually prevented the winner from winning, and is a bad design.  Several house rules need to be made to mitigate this bad luck potential.  One house rule we did play with made the condition that removes all your skills (grief sticken?) made the condition a pain, but reasonable.

This would be good for a break for a regular role-playing group (IMHO) to play once.

this does remind me a lot of Talisman.

There doesn't seem to be much logic behind the consequences of your choices, so this becomes mostly a game of "wander around and see what happens."  I guess the value is mostly in the storytelling element, but for that, you're better off with a RPG.

I would play again on one condition: that I'm given the chance to get solidly drunk first.

RATING: 7.1
First play lived up to the storytelling billing. My character was imprisoned on the first turn, then turned into an ape, then taken by an enchantress to a volcano and thrown in, which resulted in me by thrown out far away, lost and wounded. We didn't get to any places of power in this game, and only got one treasure at the end of the game, so it feels like there is a lot to see in this game over multiple plays.

Charming game to play as long as you don't expect any strategy nor even real tactic. There are choices to be made but they are often quite apparent and the result is often very chaotic.

Depending on my mood, I'll want to give this game a lower, or higher score. Right now, it's sitting at 7, but as I type this I want to change it to 6.5.
Maybe 6.
But I can't. This game has something no other game in my library can boast: REAL STORY TELLING. I bought Mice and Mystics because it was supposed to be a story-telling game.
It isn't. 
I play the card game Once Upon A Time with my friends, but those stories become goofy efforts at one-upmanship that OCCASIONALLY linger in my mind. It's one great game for every four or five plays. 
Tales of Arabian nights is Pure, Amazing, STORY!
And, not much game. 
Not much game at all. 
Oh, sure, it has a gorgeous game board, great artwork, loads of tokens, and lots of cards. LOTS OF CARDS! But the "game" element is almost non-existent. 
The basis of this experience is a mammoth book of tales that enables you to participate in a group "Choose your own adventure." One person looks up a matrix of your current stats and location and then gives you the name of an encounter (person, place or thing) that you choose to interact with based on another matrix. It gets a bit challenging, but all that cross-referencing results with someone reading you a WELL WRITTEN (looking at you Mice and Mystics) engrossing, paragraph that ends with you making further choices, or gives you options based on your stats. From that point, you might make a choice, and your narrator might read some more, and in the time it takes you to rub a magic lamp, you end up in prison, or changed into an animal, or gain some cool new trait.
It's very linear, but absolutely brilliant.

The person reading your story can add to the game immensely by using their own unique personality and verbal/acting skills as they tell you about the Sultan who dispatches henchmen to throw you into a pit for beating a beggar, or how you used a magic bow to shatter a crystal mountain. 
The stories are good, but it's all in the performance. A good reader can elevate your game experience to an evening of high art, or leave you yawning into your palm if they read it like a stodgy librarian who's too bored with their own life to bother breathing life into the printed word.

That's why I waver on the score because this game is all about who you play with. 
That, and it takes TOO long, and as you get more traits and skills, it gets harder and harder to understand the choice matrix which leads to confusion and can leave you arguing over the rules.
It can fall apart very quickly, but you have to respect what the designers have done with this game, even if it leaves you wishing they had actually included a game.

What they have done is gift you with a box of wonders, and it's up to you what you do with it.

I think that, in itself, is an excellent use of the theme.

Fun story that works on the right night with the right people. With two people the game plays more quickly but keeping track of Book of Tales and Reaction Chart as well as resulting status cards and skill chits can seem cumbersome. With more than 3-4 the game will just drag and drag.

I wish there was more of a long term developing story aspect (the quests add a little of this). Without this the game feels repetitive and by the second hour begins to bore me. I am considering shortening the game to 15-16 story/destiny points to keep the game under 1.5 hrs.

RATING: 5
I fell in love with the whole story-reference thing, but soon realized that your choices don't actually mean you make those choices. Pretty bad design there. e.g. If you pick "Combat" when you meet a Djinn, you're most likely not actually going to attack it and something unrelated happens...

A bit disappointed by this. I played the West End version long ago but barely remember it. This edition is richly produced and pleasant enough, but it overstays its welcome. The theme is wonderfully realized, but the narrative actually falls a little short to me, as the encounters don't really link into any greater epic -- I want a great story, not a series of random encounters. The statuses and changing story and destiny points are supposed to create a character and story arc, I suppose, but they fall short. Some of the status effects are excessively debilitating (especially those that degrade movement). I play it with my son and run it like a light RPG, throwing out statuses that would make the game drag. I like it enough to play it again but this won't hit the table often.

Played 3+. Takes about 3 hours to play with 3 or 4 players I would imagine with 6 it would take forever. I would now not want to play with any other number but 3. Nice change to the other games I own though one playing every 6 months would be enough for me. Everyone I have played with (well educated teens and my partner who is an English teacher), struggle reading some of the words, I know they are being true to the original names but the effort of reading challenging pronunciations for 3 hours is fatiguing. For me they could have westernised some of the text to aid the flow when reading aloud.

The game has a really unique feel which I think works best when played on a lazy holiday afternoon with a couple of teenagers. Jan 11

I decided to get this one out and play it solo since it has official solo rules. I really enjoyed this game even though most of what happens in the game is largely out of your control. That being said, it was still fun to flip over those encounter cards and see what would happen. As for the solo rules themselves they were pretty good. I had the hardest time with the objective of becoming "fabulously rich." I had no issues getting my destiny and story points, which are the two tracks you move up in the normal game to determine victory. Overall this game is extremely unique and is definitely one I'm holding on to. It is quite the gem of a game.

A very strange game in that you make many decisions yet it is still entirely random.  You might as well roll dice to decide what to do on your turn.  That said, for a totally random game, it's fairly entertaining.  I'd imagine that after a few plays it would become boring.

More of a game then I thought that it would be. We had a player get a sex change, be turned into a snake and become a Sultan, I just spent most of my time in the ocean being put in jail.

It's hard to determine a rating for this game. On the one hand, it is engaging and fun to play, but it isn't really much of a [i]game[/i]. Starting with a 6, may drop to 5.

Players move their characters through a map and have adventures which reward them with points (Story and/or Destiny), treasure, skills, or some combination of those. The game ends when someone has reached their predicted level of Story and Destiny points.

Unfortunately, there's very little one can do to actually influence what type or how many points one receives. Also, you have minimal influence on anything that happens to other players as well. So you must listen to their stories, and on your own turn make just one choice and listen to your own story. Listening to all these tales takes a long time, and that's a problem as well.

If this game moved more quickly and gave you more direct control over your destiny, I would like it better. However, both of those things are kind of the opposite of what the game is going for. It's supposed to be a leisurely meandering storytelling session with friends, so on that level it succeeds.

I imagine that people who like this sort of game would rather be playing D&D, and those who don't would rather be playing anything else.

RATING: 6
Definitely an experience kind of game where the winning or losing doesn't really matter. The cards and stories that happen each turn are fun and interesting so that even if you are just watching it's an entertaining experience. I think it goes on a little bit too long with 5 or 6 players though, so I'd probably prefer to play with 4 or less.

For 1 or 2 players.  Don't play it with the higher player counts, but with the lower counts, this game can create the most amazing storytelling experience.

Need versions in other languages, especially french since it's so colourful.

This game would be really awesome in French because of the greater vocabulary that language has... I am pretty sure it would be also great in Chinese and other languages with great vocabulary.

Highly re-playable, never same game twice even if you play with max players for 10 games.

It has some randomness, but it is a good randomness.

The game would be even greater if it was modernized with a complementary application for phones, tablets and laptops that would take charge of the storybook and the tables. But what kills it is the changing sex bug where there is no way to change back unless you randomly get that event again. If that would be fixed then this game would be 10/10 for me.

I got this game first of all to play 2 players with my wife. I figured my gaming group would not be into it because they are all more of a "I'll kill him...uuuu I got 8 on a die he is toast!" So once one of my friends came to my place with his girlfriend and she is not into the whole board gaming so I suggested we play Arabian Nights. She loved it. More of a suprise was after a few days when we had our regular weekly gaming night and that friend came he asked for it. We took it out and played 6 player. Everyone was focused on it, everyone loved it.

Other that the fact that rules are really simple and only thing you really need to be able is to read English. People are having fun with this game and do not seem to care if they win or loose here. Story kind of keeps them interested and they always seem to want to know "What will happen next?"

Since I fairly frequent get new games and takes a while to master some of them. This one was also loved because of it's simplicity and easy to follow the game flow.

This is not a game, it's a chaos simulator. But like a good slapstick comedy it will keep you entertained and surpises are around every corner. 2-3 players works very well, 4 is the maximum I'd play this with and more just ends up in too much downtime. Production values are also the best I've ever seen, it's just beatiful! I'm happy to own this, but the limited times when this is the correct choice keep it lower than Battlestar Galactica, which is another game, where the game and winning it is a side-quest and the experience the most important part.

Played at Origins.  The game plays you.  It is a very cool group story telling exercise but calling it a game implies that the choices you make can influence in the outcome in a more than arbitrary way, and that simply is not true.  This is a very cool "experience" game and looking at it in that light ONLY might score 2 or 3 points higher.  Looking at it as a board game it doesn't have much going for it.  On the other hand, this is one of the sweetest choose your own adventure style games I have ever seen.  Z-Man did a great job with it.  Difficult to rate, because it depends on what you are looking for.

Update:  Played a second time.  My initial impressions of this game didn't really explain what is so fun about it.  You basically sit around and hear a story about each of your characters, and after a while, someone will win.  As a game, it isn't much, but as a fun cooperative activity, it is really great.

An epic game. Very different. It's about the journey, not winning, in spite of having win conditions. It's amazing with just a couple of people but can be very slow and boring with more than 4 people. I prefer 2 players. It takes a while to flip through the massive book to read the scenarios. That's the only real downside. I recently heard of an app to speed things up, though. Need to try that out. Besides the length of turns due to dealing with the big book of scenarios, the game is very interesting. Every time you play it's different. Best story telling game I have seen and has great replayability.

I am completely enamored of this game at the moment. I love the narrative it creates. I love watching the fortunes and failures happen. I recognize that this may not even be a game in the truest sense of the word, but it doesn't matter. Winning isn't the point. It still feels great when you do. This is 2 hours of fantastical escape into a harsh and magical world and while other games I love have pieces of that experience (Chaostle, Betrayal at House on the Hill), nothing distills that storytelling aspect down to its purest form quite like Tales of the Arabian Nights does. This one will be on my shelf forever.

RATING: 5.5
As they say, this is a game that is not about winning, it's about enjoying the story.  It's exactly what the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure "novels" of the 1980s were all about.

One point of strategy is that you might want to set your goal to be skewed towards more Story, because higher Destiny gives you higher encounter rolls (which makes things more difficult, I think), and because you can sacrifice 3 Destiny points while Diseased to give other people the Diseased attribute!

I want to like this more than I do, but it really is an exhausting game that doesn't give much in the way of payoff or reward. As frustrating as that can be, there's still a lot of fun to be had with enjoyable storytelling, a well-realized theme, and a massive scale of possibilities. Just don't expect to have much control over any of these things, even when you're confident in your decisions. We hardly finish any game of this but always come away with some fun memories of misfortune...and there's plenty of that to go around.

Interesting game. The story events are very dream-like (imagistic, episodic). It was hard to string these together into a common developing narrative, and I'm not sure it's possible. The stories are a collection of events without the internal unity of development (or rather, without that special something makes experiences reasonate together in a continuous thread rather than remain segmented into atomized events). I have decided (for now) that that games without a unity of development don't have narrative, and therefore that TotAN cannot sustain a running narrative. As a result, while the game is fun to play and hang out with, it is missing one key element for compelling stories: dramatic tension.

Tales of the Arabian nights is a game I really wanted to like: I love the idea of a choose-your-own-adventuresque boardgame rife with storytelling. Unfortunately, the game drags on with too many players, the decisions feel random, and without players storying the disparate story events together into a coherent narrative, the game falls somewhat flat.

It doesn't help that I played this after a few heavy games... but I could play this again.

A relaxing game where you get to laugh at your own and others (mis)fortunes. The outcome of the stories can be very random and funny. The experience is very dependent on the players mood and their efforts to immerse themselves in the storytelling.
The game should not be played with a competitive mindset, it's too random for that.
It's a bit long for what it offers. Don't play with more than 4 players.

My comments didn't reflect a 7-worthy game, so I've lowered it to a 6.  I still feel this game is too random and feels like a toy rather than a game.  Below comments still apply.

Everything is far too random.  You randomly pick how you win, you randomly guess what actions to use on which encounters, hoping you've picked the right choice to get you the right amount of random points for your random winning condition.  You pick up random skills trying to use them at random times, and random curses and positive statuses will come your way.  The quests come out randomly for each player and everything feels like it is out of your hands.  As though you're not really playing, but just watching.

It can be good for some laughs but seems like more of a toy than a game.  With the right people I'd play it again but I'd likely prefer something else.

Was one of the first batch of games I bought when I got back into the hobby.  Originally had this marked as an 8, but maybe my tastes have changed since or I've had a run of bad games, but I didn't find it very enjoyable the last few times we've played this. 

Too many options remove any form of player agency (handing other players control over your character's choice of action, or forcing the character to stay in the same location and repeat the same encounters until a certain condition occurs).

Several of the rules on cards are open to interpretation.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is a Choose your own Adventure game, with lots of deliberately added chaos thrown in, all for fun.

While not a roll-&-move, there is a deliverate amount of variability in a player's ability to choose their own actions (much less destiny), and a plethora of chits and statuses needing sorted and maintained.

Furthermore, it's longish- but I like it. The Choose your own Adventure model was fun, but too limited- this takes players in hundreds of directions, and gives them a chance to role play, and just enjoy the hand of Kismet in their alter-ego's lives.

Rather than having each player choose a secret combination.  For example, first person to get S+D=12 can win.  (This converts a multi-hour slog into a delightful hour-plus—which means we get to play it more often!)

SO many improvements on the original: a few confusing rules dropped, and better component design to reduce the amount of chits, although there's still way too much crap on the table. Love how everyone gets an encounter on every turn.

We played with 5p and set the winning condition to 10 combined story/destiny points (user-determined formula). It went a bit over 3 hours; would probably try 8 points for that many players next time.

3/5 players ended up winning, so with that kind of pacing I think it would be easy to project game length if you know the relationship between the number of rounds & points to win the game. Gotta remember to track that next time.

Fun party game.

RATING: 6
I knew what to expect going in and it didn't live up to my expectations. The stories are disconnected and totally random. Sure it generates a series of potentially interesting/amusing anecdotes but they only merge into a real narrative arc if you supply heaps of your own imagination. Which I can do better via some kind of storytelling RPG like Fiasco or Primetime Adventures or Baron Munchausen.

Several of the actual mechanics of the game fail badly: you get to choose between two different kinds of points as your final goal but none of us could ever figure out how to get one versus the other. Taking anything other than the default split seemed silly. The game has morning, afternoon, and night phases but we didn't get anywhere close to morning (after ~3 hours of play).

This is for people who want to play a storytelling RPG but don't want to try to convince family/friends.

I think most of us are familiar with the story of Scheherazade and the tales of 1001 Arabian Nights.  Given that the whole collection is about a woman using her skills as a storyteller, it's entirely appropriate that Tales of the Arabian Nights revolves around story rather than strategy.

This is entirely an "experience" game, where the primary goal is enjoy the "story" rather than win the game.  There are decisions to be made but no way to reasonably predict the impact those decisions will have.  That said, the paragraphs are well written and entertaining, all the more so for being unpredictable.  If you don't mind the random feel to decisions and the story aspect of the game appeals to you, chances are you'll really enjoy this game.  If not, I'd suggest steering clear or, at the very least, trying the game before buying it.

As for me, I'm a professional storyteller (part time).  I think the game is brilliant.

This game has to be played in the right frame of mind.  First of all, treat it like a shared story telling experience and less like a game.  There is too much randomness to truly have any meaningful effect on the outcome, so just give in to the story.  It can be absolutely hilarious and fun if you can accept that mindset.

This was like reading a choose your own adventure story concurrently with other people.  Your choices didn't matter one bit about how likely you would succeed or if your skills were important or not.  And as a building a narrative kind of game, it was so disjointed it didn't make any damn sense.

A simple role-playing game that essentially consists of making a random choice of action is response to an equally random encounter. The problem is that no real world common sense can assist you, the 'barber' that you meet may turn out to be evil, the 'beggar' scorns your assistance. No matter how many skill tokens you acquire you never seem to have the right one to benefit, so the game only ramps up slowly. This may be playable for a laugh, but that's highly group dependent, gamers tend to be a logical lot, making this more family fare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is such a departure from the sort of game I usually look for, and also an amazing amount of fun.  It's all about the stories, and the stories are pretty good. I also like how players are free to wander around the world and do their thing; it compares favorably to games like Betrayal at the House on the Hill where eventually you all just have to go to some room and roll dice, which isn't very exciting. In this game you are always doing something interesting and new. Well, as long as you aren't in prison.

The best part? Reading the paragraphs for someone else.  That's why it seems best to play with four; you are usually either reading or playing.  

There is some ablism in the game, and, you know, I kind of wish there weren't.  But it's not enough to put me off the game.  (1 play)

The game is too random. Not that I care if I win or lose, that's not the point. But depending on the paragraphs you are pointed to, it could be a blast, or just plain boring, dragging too long.

Hint: Use the optional rule of max 1-2 conditions and use whatever other house-rules you can think of, to help it be as fun as possible. After all, that's the game's goal.

Hint2: Acting out the paragraphs you read can take the game to a whole new level!

PS: Really good grasp of the language is required of all players.

First played July 16th, 2009. Taught in 15 minutes, played in 2 & 1/2 hours with 5 players. This game is more about an adventure and taking your character on that adventure. Everone is given a quest card the must complete before they make it back to Bagdad. You also must gain 15/20 points as well. Before you start, you choose a token from both Story and Destiny to total this number and keep it hidden. Everyone starts at Bagdad as well. Each person has a Story, Destiny, and Wealth track(start on Poor). The Wealth track determines how fast you move(3 on land and 2 by sea to start). Each person is allowed to pick three skills to start as well. On your turn, you can move on the board towards ful-filling your quests and then you draw an encounter card. The person on your left looks up the matrix number on the card in the book and then the person on the right looks up the matrix table for what you drew and which action you decided to pick and then the person on the left looks up the outcome. You are rewarded with skills, lose/gain story/destiny/wealth points depending on your current skills and what action you chose. You can also get city cards that you keep. If you reach that city again, you get two encounter cards. It seems to be a bit overerly figity for me. If you like stories and a group game with some light fun, this is a good game to try out.

Gotta love this "game". Not that its really a game. Its more a "see where the story takes you" feeling. 
You can win with points tho. and my boyfriend who doesn't like the game as much as i do is always mad when he doesn't get the points he deserves. :) 
Its just not that kind of game where you have to aim for victory. 
I dont like roleplaying games cus i don't like to make up my own story.. This game is doing it for you. Its more like reading a book! The fantasy is made for you, only in your head you can make it how you want it. 
So if you like this element this is a game for you!

Choose your own adventure path game.  Very simple mechanic with an entertaining story line.  Not a lot of weight to the game, but very rich story telling feature.

It's got some great flavor, and it can serve as a fun "experience" game for the right group. I find it's a little dry with repeated play, though.

This game is definitely not for everyone and even the right people probably need to be in the right mood to get the most out of it. The game takes the form of a story driven adventure, where you take one of the heroes of legend from the tales of the arabian nights and take them on a romp attempting to find fame and fortune. There is no final battle or required ending to the tale, once you have enough points you can return home to win the game. However I don't think trying to win makes this game fun, trying to tell a good story is where the magic happens. So if you can dial back the competitiveness and try to ham up the story a bit, you can find a fun distraction in Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Is it technically a game? Debatable.

Is it incredibly fun? Yes. Oh, yes.

I can fully understand the misgivings about this game due to some of it's random nature, and the ambiguity regarding player decisions impacting the game. HOWEVER, for me that does not preclude it from being one of the most entertaining games I've played. Seeing the narrative of a given game twist around, hearing all the various stories, it's really a delight to take part in the experience. 

This has become a favorite amongst the people I regularly play games with. Is it for everyone? No. Gamers looking for a mechanic-heavy strategic experience will probably loathe this game. But people that enjoy the more social aspects to gaming, the sharing of an experience, will really love this one. I have a feeling storytelling mode (in which players take the core aspects of a story result from the book and then apply their own spin) will truly be the best way to play the game. 

Update: Indeed, after playing a few games in which the player's took liberties with the story results in the book, and applied some of our own narrative flavor and personality, the game launched into another stratosphere. Easily one of the most fun games ever, and it's always requested that I bring it along to any game nights. I will play this anytime, anywhere, with anyone.

Can be either really thematic, fun and satisfying or leave you crippled, shunned, cursed and a slave who is unable to do anything but wallow in misfortune while others progress towards victory.

Sometimes having the 10000 horrible things happen to you works out and feels great in a twisted way, but still it seems a bit too easy to get totally stuck on a single thing that stops you from participating properly in the game. 

If one can make peace with the vagaries of chance and the unability to totally control ones fate it's awesome.

Belongs to my most awesome fianceé.

Arabian Nights borders on being a thematic party game.  It's largely random and you often don't feel in control of your own fate but this aspect of its storytelling system are 100% true to the Arabian Nights stories.  Some effects can be major setbacks but you're often rewarded for taking risks and doing things you wouldn't normally think are good ideas like abducting beautiful princesses or beating beggars.  If you want a thematic experience light on the gameplay and heavy on hilarious interactions, Arabian Nights is THE beer and pretzels game.

Purely an experience game, there is really very little strategy to the game.  Even when I tried to match up my skills to my choices it seemed pretty much a crap shoot as to whether it was a good event or bad. All in all a fun game but not something I'll be pining to play a lot.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is less a game than a group choose-your-adventure story.  Set in the fantasy setting of Arabian Nights, you each choose a character along with two starting skills.  You then each take a turn moving your piece on the board.  You each have a mission card that can provide some direction to your travels but basically you just want to go to happening spots (with a high number).  There you pick a card to discover what happens and roll a die to find out how big an encounter it was.  You cross-reference a table and then your fellow player tells you what sort of character or event you have encountered (e.g., a hungry tiger or an ugly barber).  You then make a choice, consisting of a single verb from a table of relevant actions (e.g., "drink", "fight", etc).  The fellow player then looks up the corresponding paragraph number and rolls a -/+/0 die roll and then reads aloud to you a brief story about your encounter, full of djinn, evil viziers, monsters, and treasure.   The relationship between your choice and the resulting story is often a bit mysterious.  Oftentimes if you have a particular skill (e.g., "magic", "faith", "storytelling") then you'll have a good ending and some kind of payoff, including more skills or the Story and Fate points you need to win.  You can try choosing actions that steer the stories towards your skills but that can get boring.  If you have an advanced version of the skill (by getting it twice) then the reader will skip the final die roll and simply choose the story that allows your master skill to be used if such an option is present.  The multiple steps can get a little clumsy but the stories are quite charming and fun.  Needless to say, there is a huge luck factor and a runaway winner syndrome as accumulating skills result in yet better outcomes.  It's best to approach it as more of a party game and just enjoy the ride.  Taken in this way, I definitely enjoy playing it from time to time with the right group.  I do recommend house ruling the status "grief" to be just until the next good thing happens to you as otherwise its effect (to not have any skills) is crippling and, worse, leads to boring stories.

Tends to drag on a little bit, and the statuses that make you lose control of your character are annoying. The narrative of your story is usually disjointed and nonsensical. Not quite the jaw-dropping experience a lot of people make it out to be. That being said, I've never laughed so hard playing a board game.

Not so much a game - more of a story-reading experience.  A huge laugh with the right people - and becoming grief-striken, ensorcelled and enslaved all at the same time can be great fun.

But I don't think there's enough control over what happens to rate it as a boardgame.

This game is a lot of fun. Come up with a character you want to play and watch what happens—it can get ridiculous! Being in jail is no fun, though; we use a variant where, the third time you fail to get out, you're out of jail, but you suffer some penalties.

RATING: 7
This game is about the story.  Some pretty amazing things can happen, and that is the real draw of the game.  Watching the players develop can be very interesting.  Unfortunately, the beginning of the game can lead to some players feeling like they cannot get anything going well for them.  The better rewards only happen after a few skills have been built, and the players that start gaining skills faster will tend to do better.  As a result, there is some runaway leader problem with the game.  This has turned off some that I play with (namely my wife) who want more competition and less story telling.

A great story-telling game in the world of the Arabian Nights tales.  Lots of bits, the whole thing is saturated in theme, and it's a lot of fun.  The only reason I didn't give it a perfect rating is the fact that players have very restricted control over what happens to their characters, and choosing a goal out of story and destiny points seems pointless, as it's entirely random what you get each turn.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2012)

I didn’t think I would like this game but I do. You don’t have a lot of deep, meaningful decisions to make in tales of Arabian Nights, however the game is too fun to pass and I really enjoy myself when I play it :D. In this game you can´t plan your moves, you have to let yourself go and flow with the story. 

The game is hugely thematic, the status cards are hilarious and the adventures are very exciting. It is great to play with non-gamers as the rules are so simple, however it can take a while to play.

I think this is a 3 player game, more than that and the downtime can be excessive (as you don’t have anything to think/do until it is your turn). This is the first game I really wish had an Spanish version, last time we played I got throat ache because I had to read and translate everything.

Good game, I want to play it again, just not every time.

Based on the previews and rules, I was optimistic that Z-Man had done an excellent job with this reprint.  But that couldn't compare to actually experiencing the redone Tales.  In almost all ways this printing improves on the West End version, and it will undoubtedly become the definitive version of the game.  Statuses are now cards, eliminating the irritating need to look up a paragraph for each status a character has.  City cards have been fixed so that they lead to an encounter, and are uniformly positive thus giving players an incentive to actually use them.  "Take that" cards are gone, mercifully, though certain statuses allow one to bestow their effects on other players.  Quests are a fun new addition.  The art is fantastic, and the new board integrates the fiddly "cradle of civilization" encounter modifiers and loses the fiddliness.  The story paragraphs are detailed enough not to force any embellishment on the reader's part, but open-ended enough to allow for some if the reader is a talented storyteller.  Also there are more than twice the number of paragraphs as in the old Book of Tales, and the reaction matrices have been updated to eliminate stupidity like the "infinite hunchback loop" from the old game.  Skills have been cleaned up so there's no longer that silly distinction between Minor and Major magic, and Bargaining and Evaluation are combined into one skill that actually doesn't suck.

I'm still not sold on the story/destiny goal, which seems to reduce the game to a collection of victory points, but I'm not sure how to replace it.  Possibly with a time limit or a set number of turns.  Once in a while a group should play to Sultan for the epic experience, but one thing I noticed when playing a Sultan variant is that the players tend to figure out what roads lead to Sultan.  That's bad.

For what I think about the original game, see my comment on the West End version.  To sum up, it's a fantastic roleplaying experience that only vaguely fits the definition of "game."  As long as all players know that going in, that isn't a problem.

I agree with those who play only with 4 or less - I would even say the optimal numbers are 2 and 3.  Watching the action is fun, but it's much more fun participating and the downtime really would get intolerable with 5 or above.  2-player, 2 characters each is probably also viable.  It was viable with the West End version at least.

2013-12-10 - Everything everyone says about this game is completely true. You can't go in thinking you have any control at all, or, even worse, thinking that smart play and good decisions are going to win you the game. If you go in with the right mindset, though, that you're playing a story that's happening to you, it's a great way to pass some time and have a few laughs.

TotAN is a huge hit with my entire family.  =D  A narrative storytelling game where player enthusiasm seems more focused on the randomness in thematic adventures than overall scoring.  The 'Book of Tales' is utterly amazing in effort and content, I can't imagine the time it must have taken to create this game.  It doesn't take long to figure out the significance in 'which' of the many Skill (ability) markers you need to better advance.

As a house rule, we may soon increase the initial Skill markers from 3 to 5 and/or decrease the VPs from 20 to 15.

RATING: 4
This isn't a game.

There really is no decision making outside of what space you'd like to move to and how you'd like to engage the encounter. Once that's done another player will read a little story to you, ask if you have an applicable skill then read you the outcome which is most often ridiculous.

Now I admit that I did get a few laughs out of the stories but there was really nothing that I did with my character that made them better or worse. In several cases I was directed in how I was to respond to an encounter by a trait I had, or worse yet, someone else deciding for me.

If you've enjoyed playing any RPG you may want to give this a try just to see what it's like. My guess is like me you'll suggest playing the RPG instead of this.

If you haven't played an RPG and enjoy this then you should really look into playing an RPG to experience what a good story adventure game can be.

RATING: 8
This game goes totally against the grain of the types of games I rate highly, and yet... Although I had not played this prior to 2011, it sure takes me back to my days of reading "Chose Your Own Adventure" books and the old "Alone on Halloween" solo Cthulhu adventure, where I used to narrate the story to a friend as he adventured and then he drew pictures of the various grisly ways in which he died. Ah, good times!

I know some contend this isn't even a game, but I disagree with that. You do make choices throughout, even if the outcome of almost all your choices is uncertain. The point here, though, is to have a story unfold, with your choices as the primary driver of variability and destiny, and it works on that level. I think what impressed me most is how the concept of "leveling up" manifests itself in the form of greater control. While the outcome of your choices is heavily influenced by luck, the destiny and story points and skills you obtain primarily give you a greater ability to manipulate outcomes, bringing the whims of fate more under control (although never completely). The game works so well in fact, I have to tip my hat to the designer. Being a former RPG'er I enjoy a game with a good story just as much as a tense, mind-bending economic exercise. Sadly, most story games (games with a developing character arc) become victims of their own labyrinthine mechanics (Magic Realm) or reduce the story aspect to a monotonous loop of fight, get loot, fight, get loot, and so on (too many to pick just one...). Arabian Nights, though, maintains huge variability and successfully adapts a solo adventure framework into an exceptional multi-player experience. I can't wait until my kids are old enough for this!

The big knock for me with this game is length. It can outstay its welcome, especially if everyone isn't totally into the stories unfolding.

This review is after one play only; I have never quite played a game like this, (although it sort of reminded me of my D&D games as a kid), but I really liked what I experienced. Love the Arabian Nights, and I really like the beautiful pieces. I think the key to enjoying this game is playing with the right people. The other 2 people I played with don't like cut-throat strategy games where everyone is out to win, so this game was right up their alley. At first, while reading the rules, I really did not like the homophobia present in terms of courting (and no, I don't want to get into that. Already been done on the boards), but any house rule can override such silly rules. I'm wondering what play will be like with a larger group.

This game is more like a choose your own adventure book than a game. There is some game there - there are points and a winner, but it is best to enter the game with an attitude of, "let's see what adventure unfolds." On the down side, the adventure can be frustrating at times (you might end up stuck for several turns) and it can run too long, but over all this is a very enjoyable time. Also, some of the story elements are so general that they can be nonsensical, but that can be amusing, too. RPG'ers or other storytellers can paraphrase the story line to make it more relevant and interesting, but you don't need this skill for the game to be fun. As in many games and game nights, the right attitude is the key.
Relax with a glass or two of your favorite beverage, some snacks, and share the adventure with your family and friends.

Warning: not a competitive game (at all). See my comment on the original West End Games edition for more detail. 

I've now played the new edition once (7/22/09). I've played the original West End Edition around 15 times, and it's one of my favorite games. This edition certainly looks better (although the original can stand on its own merits), but the functionality has been greatly improved. Statuses are in card form instead of on counters, so the effects are right in front of you and do not need to be constantly double-checked in the book of tales. The city cards have been fixed, although they were so sloppy in the original it's hard to imagine anyone opting not to house rule them. Quests have been added. The DP/SP ramp ups have been tweaked and now trigger somewhat sooner. Bargaining and Evaluation are now one skill. Major and Minor magic are now one skill. The WEG Book of Tales has 1400 paragraphs. The Z-man edition has 2600 and comes in a very durable spiral bound book (several plays would reduce the WEG book to tatters). 

A great edition of a great game. 

Thanks to Z-man for reprinting one of the most entertaining games ever. 

**My one caveat with this game is that it could better match outcomes to decisions, or narrative to role-playing. However it's tough to feel strongly about this when Tales does it better than every other game on the market. Face it; designers suck at this.

I can see why this game was so highly sought after while it was out of print.  It certainly is unique, especially for those (like me) that have never played an RPG.  I'm assuming that this is not really an RPG, but it my mind I imagine them to be somewhat similar.  I guess that's all conjecture, so I think of it more as a choose your own adventure type game.

You definitely have to have the right kind of group for a game like this.  Since it's not really a competitive event, but rather mainly solitaire, getting into the spirit of the game, especially while reading from the book, is essential.  It also needs to keep moving along quickly, since there's not really anything for you to do during someone else's turn other than listen and enjoy.

The work that went into organizing the game is tremendous and is truly impressive.  It's really cool how the matrices work and it's fun to consider your options.  An imprisoned princess?  Hmm...would it better to aid or attack her?  A shiny artifact - take it or enter it?

The only thing I wish it that there was some easier way to get to where you need to go in the book.  This type of game is just screaming for an iPhone/iPad app that will quickly tell you where to turn.  I don't mind turning to the actual paragraph, but having to look at the two different matrices is a little annoying.

This is not even a game. It's an activity, a la Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. If you go into this hoping for a strategy game with elegant mechanics, you're just going to be disappointed. Yes, there is no way to know whether to rob the beggar or aid him. Yes, bad things happen to good people and vice versa. Yes, there is hardly any forward-thinking that goes into it at all.

This game is one of my favourites.  It requires the perfect storm of 3-4 players and a few quiet hours to kill, which doesn't actually happen often in my playgroup.  Usually we have like 6+ people who want to play something light, party games etc.

This game is everything it wants to be.  I'm very impressed by the choose your own adventure style to it and how well the stories do seem to flow.

That said I hated it.  A lot.  I hate it when people leave a game in progress... but leaving this game had absolutely no impact on any of the other players.  It was a 6 player game of solitaire where a die could have played nearly as effectively as I did.

Stick to two or three players or else the pace suffers. Downward spirals happen often, and they still feel terrible, despite that this is a story-based game. To partially alleviate that, Grief-Stricken, Insane, and Ensorcelled should be house-ruled to provide less of a downside, and less of an "I'm not even playing this game anymore" feel.

I first played this at Gamestorm 2012 and had a blast.  We laughed our heads off and I realized immediately that it wasn't a game where the winner has the most points.  It's simply a game where everyone wins because they had a good time.  The scoring system is worthless in my opinion.  A second play was also enjoyable but I realized that ultimately I prefer games with at least some strategy.  This was just too random and could go on and on and would only end when finally someone said is should.  Both times some people were definitely ready to quit before others.  I probably should have held onto this game; the theme and mechanics are very unique and the components good (that box is solid!) but it just wasn't going to see enough gameplay.

Compared to previous editions the third one discards the flawed merchant rules entirely; dispenses with the storytelling and solo rules, although they are available as downloadable texts adapted with minimal changes from the second edition; exchanges the largely themeless quest rules for a new card-based system that is part of the standard game; changes the city cards so that they provide encounters and also have no outright bad results; and adds a considerable amount of new paragraphs. There are a few other improvements that could have been made and ambiguities that could have been resolved, and the city cards may be a tad generous, but all things considered this is the version most people should be playing.

This game is so random it's impossible to plan a strategy for winning. Normally I would hate that but Tales the entire point it to see what horrible thing happens to your friends. There's nothing like watching someone else fall into a sex change spring, go insane, get depressed, fall into the ocean and marry a merman prince. You don't care who the game thinks is winning because everyone wins.

This might be the most difficult game in my collection to rate properly because there is nothing else like it. This is not my kind of game. It's not about creatively developing strategies in response to what other people do. It's about surviving what happens to you. And yet, it is a fascinating game and one that is unlikely to ever leave my collection.

Excellent story telling game.  Not for the gamer who demands perfectly balanced games with firms rules on how to win. This game relies on chance and it's not really "played to win". Rather, sit back and enjoy the story that unfolds.

I HIGHLY recommend using house rules to lessen the negative effects or at least lessen the duration of the effects. Download the home rules and player mats in the Files section here at BGG. Otherwise, this game can be brutal and frustrating at times.

Once one realizes that the winner of the game is s/he who has developed the best story for hir character, and not s/he who has attained the required story and destiny points, Arabian Nights is exactly where it should be. 

In this sense Arabian Nights is more a way to generate a fun story - and it is always fun. It doesn't take very long to learn, either.

Not really a board game, but a highly random series of unconnected events.  Skills seem to have little bearing on results.  No truly meaningful choices, and excruciatingly long for what it is.  It took us 3 1/2 hours to play with 4 players.  Had it taken an hour, I would have given it a rating of 5.  Two hours would have dropped it to a 3 or 4.  After three hours, all but the game's owner were losing their minds from sheer boredom.  It'd be better to just ditch the victory conditions and use this as a Mad Libs type of party amusement, stopping after the novelty wore off.

What can i say about this one?
I don't think it is really a game like anything I've played before. It comes closest to a dungeon crawler.
In the game you will have many encounters and depending on which action you take you are given a situation. In that situation yau may use one of your skills  or even have to use one of your skills. After that encounter you get some  story points and destination points, perhaps some nw skills, treasures and some statusses.

Basicly the game is build upon the situations you can encounter (2600) a lot with different options.
You should know by now if this is something you want to play or not. the game was won by someone who likes to carefully plan . And actually yhat's pretty strange. As a lot of these encounters just happen to you. He just got lucky allthough he will certainly disagree and after the game he explained that a good skill set was important.
Probably forgetting that he acquired the skillset by the lucky draw of encounters.

He liked it,  the other friend I played it with didn't.
I wouldn't mind playing it again with someone who likes it. Actually it's light on the brain to play. so it would make the perfect game in between two heavy ones or end a gameday. allthough it takes rather long to play
The downside to it is that the game is heavily language dependant (you read stories) and the english isn't exactly the most easy ones (you read stories with a lot of flavour and mysterious encounters)

Would I recommend it?
that's a tough one and you really have to decide that for yourself. 
I would stay away from it, if you can't find it in your language and you don't have a big friendgroup that can play it in another language.
I also would stay away from it if you want to play this seriously. It's a game you just have to play for fun.
You have some say in your destiny but you can also go insane and then you don't have a say, or be grieve stricken

I do think it is the perfect game for 3 or 4 players.
3 because everyone is involved. Player , storyteller and matrixreader.
4 because someone can get some chips or drinks when he/she has nothing to do (you can listen to the crazy stories developing though)

I like this game because it is so original.  Thought I feel that no matter what you guess when given an option, you are probably always going to be wrong.  :)  But that became fun for our groups as you would get to laugh at the other players at the table.  I also think that it is a game that as we play it more it will speed up and currently it seems longer than it should be, but that will correct itself over time.

This is my brothers favorite game. For quite a while I wanted to get this game, but decided to wait for a new germand edition. Finally I figured there probably never will be another one, so I got the english edition.  Considering this game is extremely text heavy, this severely limits the people I can play this with.
That aside though, I think the game is brilliant. It reminds us a little of the fighting fantasy and lone wolf adventure books, but due to its randomness it has more replayability. So far I have never won a session, but still had a lot of fun while playing.

In Tales of the Arabian Nights, you are the hero or heroine in a story of adventure and wonder just like those told by Scheherazade to her spellbound sultan! You will travel the land seeking your own destiny and fortune. You will learn stories and gain wisdom to share with others. Will you be the first to fulfill your destiny? The next Tale is yours to tell! There is, of course, a winner in Tales of the Arabian Nights, but the point of the game is less to see who wins and more to enjoy the unfolding and telling of a great story!

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] 1 very minor house rule is necessary to unlock the game's full potential (see below).


Because of its very strong focus on storytelling and overall high randomness, some people would probably not consider [b]Tales of the Arabian Nights[/b] to be an actual "game". Maybe they are right, but it is to me still without any doubt an achievement in board gaming: absolutely fantastic components (with a certain unique vintage charme), high replay value (thanks to the gigantic Book of Tales), very easy rules, many and at the same time very different choices on how to react to the game and - last but not least - often absolutely hilarious humour.

Don't play this game if you are a competitive player or someone who needs to have full control at all times in a board game. Instead, gather your friends, hand out preferred beverages and enjoy the ride, as choosing and seeing your reaction play out to an event often feels like getting your wish granted by some mischievous Djinn bound into the Book of Tales, meaning that the outcome of your reaction often can play out quite differently than first expected.

I would like to rank this game a full 10/10, but it's objectively just too random and light for that, plus downtime with more than 3 or 4 players can be a problem.

A truly unique gem, and I absolutely love it for what it is and offers.

After reading the rules and watching some reviews I would consider this a 3 player game. And a 3 player game only, with 2 you don't have a small breakpoint to reconsider choices, with more than 3 you sit there waiting for your turn shows up again.

Playing till 20 points might take a bit long, 15 points was nice. (Although when I tried that I didn't fulfill my basic quest before winning the game.)

Really depends on the mood of the other players.

The book in this game is seven shades of awesome.  Some many possibilities, all flavorful and humorous.  This is an ultra narrative adventure game that's best played with a crowd who enjoys role playing type activities a little.  You control very little and luck plays the most significant part of the result but the process of getting there is what it's all about.  If you want adventure games where you are a bit more in control & with more traditional mechanics, look into Prophecy or MageKnightBoardgame.

RATING: 3
I understand it's a classic, there are some interesting story telling ideas that could be used in other games, especially solitaire games, but the game is really annoying to play since you have to dig for paragraphs through the story books which requires 4 successive lookup, very ridiculous.

Being able to make a choice is interesting, but in the end it's very arbitrary. If I find a glitering artifact, can somebody tell me the difference between action "Take", "Use", "Open", in all scenarios, you are going to take the item and possibly use it.

I also go a load (7) of status cards which in the end had chains of interaction together which prevented me to remove any of those cards until a specific condition arrived. At one point I could not even move, because I was lost which forced me to move 1 space, and the Visier card prevented me to enter a city, and I was surrounded by city. 

So yes, contradicting card, ambiguous rule and conditions all made the game long and annoying. If you want to design a story based game, give it a try to get the ideas, but that's about it. Else I imagine it could be a nice solo game. Still, even with all those paragraph of text, it's basically roll dices, if you have skill X or not get certain rewards or not. There is not much in those story text.

I mean, with those many paragraphs, they could have made each city have unique adventures of their own. But no, they are just generic random encounters that could simply have fit on cards like Eldrich/Arkham Horror.

A game that is totally random and has pretty much no strategy, a choose your own adventure board game.  But is still a lot of fun to play just so you don't over do it and it becomes similar and you start getting the same encounters.  It can get annoying if you have a lot of bad luck, there can be whole games where you're pretty much stuck in prison or crippled or whatever, but still fun.  Just a fun game to relax and play and see what happens!

Definitely an enjoyable, story telling romp through the stories of Arabian nights!  Reminds me quite a bit of the old choose your own adventure books except in the game you likely will have skills that will at times help or hurt you in how you respond to situations.  As other people also have written, this isn't really a game you play to win, it is more a game you play to experience and enjoy the story.  Winning is just another reward on top of the experience.

I do take issue with the complaint some people have that you have very little decisions to make in this game.  In my six plays thus far, quite often taking into account which skills you have will play a significant role in the outcome of an encounter.  Sure, there will be those times where blind luck comes in for potentially the whole game (or unluckiness), but not as often as people sometimes say.

I would recommend only playing with 3; perhaps 4 at most.  Consider also just playing with a variant where instead of deciding on your victory condition before the game - just make it that your two scores have to = 20 and the minimum of each category is 5.

I do wish Z-man would have made a separate printout for the matrices.  I dislike flipping through the book twice for an encounter.  Ah well, maybe I will make a copy of that section so I can have my separate printout...:-)

This is not a good game. I've played twice and both times the game seemed to delight in making me suffer. The first game I played I ended up in prison and literally was unable to get out no matter what I tried to do. Because of this I was basically unable to play the game. Combine meaningless turns with a long time to get around the table for me to try again made for a poor experience.

The second time went better, but turns still took forever and it didn't seem to matter how well I played the role I chose at the beginning, the results of my actions were almost always bad, and sometimes very random, for instance I went into a barbershop and got hit by a cart on the way out leaving me crippled.

In neither game I played did I feel like I was playing against the other players, I felt like I was playing against the game. That can be great for cooperative games, but this isn't meant to be cooperative. It may feel better to just play by myself if I want to enjoy a fun story.

The game elements are trivial, you choose skills and choose where to go and roll a die. Most of the time I felt like my skills were meaningless, I tried playing a warrior and fighting my way out of things, but it always ended badly. Choosing where to go is almost meaningless and sometimes results in situations that make no sense, for instance in one game we had a whirlpool on a mountain top. And rolling is just to make things a little less predictable. Often the situations have outcomes that are based on information you weren't given as a "player." For instance I saw a jewel in a tree, went to take it, only to discover that the jewel wasn't actually in a tree, but was hanging around the neck of a heavily guarded woman under a tree.

If you don't care about playing an actual game and just want to enjoy the storytelling, this will be great for you. But don't expect it to feel like a fun game because it's not.

I get it. It's not really a game, it's more an exercise in story telling. I went in with high hopes for this one because I thought it sounded like a pretty interesting concept. After playing all I can ask myself is "why didn't I just play an RPG?" At least in an RPG I would feel like my choices had some bearing on the outcome of what was happening to me. It is an exercise in story telling, but it's not like you are writing the story yourself. It's more like a story reading exercise. The events happen and you are reading them out loud, but that's it. Encounters are completely random.
the components are quite good in this version though, and everything works pretty well together. I just don't understand the draw. Maybe it isn't for me. I would like to play it again, and see if this is really how the game is, or if it was just my imagination.  I would like to play a 3 player game instead of the longish 5 player game though.

After thinking about this one for a few weeks, and wanted to try it again I finally got a chance to. We went into this one taking out the "winning" conditions for the game, and just playing for a set amount of time. This made the game WAY more enjoyable to me, and allowed players to discard any min-maxing that they would have done had it been a game (in the competitive sense).  Instead we just did the craziest things we could think of to see where the story took our characters. Find a mystical fire? Why don't I just drink the mystical fire? Run into a Wicked Enchantress? Well of course you should rob her. In the end I think this makes for more enjoyable TotAN experience. The story grows, and you see where it takes you. You laugh at your own, and other player's, misfortune.  And of course getting to one of the magical cities makes each game worth it, as you sit riveted to what could possibly happen to the character. 
I certainly don't want to play this all the time, but once every two months, or so, would make me happy. I think I might even have to pick this one up for myself.

It's been a long time wanting to play this paragraph-based story game. I bought it for some time now. The eye-bewildered stories should stimulate my nerves, which have been not functioning recently. It can be a solitaire exercise with a lot of readings.

When first opening and viewing the game, I was overwhelmed & thought I'd gone in over my head. Even as we went through the rules the first time, my friend & I thought this would be really complicated.  HOWEVER, after starting a game & REALLY, thoroughly enjoying the first gameplay, the two of us, his wife, & his 11-year old son ALL enjoyed it & had a LOT of fun!! (Well, I didn't have all that much fun, but that's only cuz I ended up spending half the game imprisoned!! haha)

This is a very fun, story-making, themed game full of crazy-fun twists & lasting stories!! We want to make this a regular part of game nights with multiple people (although we worry at this point if too many people might make it go too slow...we will see!)

An exciting and enjoyable story telling game. I have found that this is one game that has nothing to do with winning or losing, and everything to do with having a good time with people. Lots of memories of this game, from the one character with 'luck' getting eaten by a Rok, to 'avoiding' sex-change springs and ending up falling in (somehow), to becoming an honoured/respected sultan when in ape-form!

RATING: 5
The game premise is great: A choose-your-own adventure romp on the Arabian Nights world. It can be fun to play once, but it's deeply flawed.

You only have 2 decisions to make every turn:
1. Where to go.
2. Which action to choose in response to the encounter.

The second one is basically random. Most of the time the outcome will be nothing like what you expected, so you might as well roll a die and let it pick for you.

The first one will matter if you're trying to reach a quest or city location. Other than that, it's pretty meaningless.

However, the ultimate game design sin is that there are plenty of statuses that will take away one of those decisions (ensorcelled, insane, etc).

This is either a game or an experience, I can't decide which. The matrices and story choices are ingenious, and create new experiences every time you play. The Arabian Nights theme is perfectly captured. The chrome seems a little tacked on sometimes, since it tries to create meaningful decisions where there are no others, but it is so well designed at I can't [i]really[/i] complain. Everyone should play this at least once.

I can't accurately describe my loathing for this game, but I will try.  I don't mind complete randomness in gameplay, but 2+ hours is too long for that.  Plus all the fiddling with the charts is too much.  This game provides the cruel illusion of meaningful decisions; however, it is exactly that, an illusion.  Though there are literally dozens of decisions to be made through the game, none of them matter.

This is not a game.  At best, it is a social activity.

RATING: 7
A masterpiece of random crap happening to you. Definitely more of a shared story-telling activity than a game. Don't buy if you don't like that. Can be exhausting after a while. There are also some serious problems that need to be house-ruled:

- The target score of 20 is too high for player counts greater than 2. The game drags on absolutely forever. I recommend even going as low as 10-12 in a three player game.

- Some statuses are brutally hard to get rid of and ruin a new player's fun. (Lost, Grief Stricken, etc.) I sometimes house-rule these to expire after a few turns.

- If you switch to noon when you run out the entire encounter deck as the rules prescribe, you will never get to noon. I don't know what they were thinking, I have never run it out even in a four player game to 20 points. I recommend switching the day/night cycle every round, or shrinking the encounter deck if you want to experience the noon and night encounters.

- No player interaction! This is a story-telling game, we need more things for players to do together! There are only a couple statuses you can lose or gain by interacting with another player. (Giving another player "Grief Stricken" using Storytelling is *hilarious*, we need more of that please!)

- Many situations do not involve the skill you would expect. I can roll with the disappointment, but it does seem egregious after a while, since the non-skilled result is usually "nothing happens" or "something awful happens". I sometimes make up my own skill checks if a player has something that seems like it should be relevant, but the book of tales should provide more options. (Wtf is the difference between "seduction", "beguiling", and "appearance"?)

- The encounters are capricious and brutal. Some players will be fabulously wealthy with 20 magical artifacts, while others are just lost for 10 turns and lose all their skills. Sometimes you can get screwed for *having* a skill.

This game is brutal. You get hit with a lot of negative status cards that make it hard do win. You better be able to commit a lot of time to this game. I love the choose your own adventure feel of the game. It's a shame that there are a bunch of different characters to choose from and they don't have any special abilities. I think it would be cool to have certain characters start off with some mastered abilities: Scheherezade and storytelling, Sindbad and seamanship. Skills that they would have from the stories they're in.

RATING: 6
This is the hands down best Choose Your Own Adventure Game to date.  For what this game is there is none better.  If you go into this expecting some sort of strategy game you will be very disappointed.  If you go into this with the expectations of having a great time with friends telling stories and enjoying the way the tales unfold you can do no batter.

Your choices are relevant in this game regardless of what some think.  The 3 skills you choose in the beginning of the game should be the way your character approaches the choices.  So if you have the Stealth and Stealing skill you should pick Rob and NOT attack.  You have a better chance of seeing your skill come up if you play your character right.  Now this doesn't apply 100% of the time but it sure does apply a lot. Choosing to attack someone without the weapon use skill is also a dumb move.  Same with Insult.  

Just know what you are going to be playing before you sit down to the table.  This is NOT a game for everyone and just wanting to try it when you know for a fact that the randomness and status cards could make you hate the game why even bother.  The game take 90 minutes with 3 players and I do not recommend any more then that play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A story telling game based on the stories in Tales of Arabian Nights.  You move around a board encountering a character, location or item.  You then consult a table and roll a dice to see what specifically you encounter.  You then have a series of options that you can choose from in a "choose your own adventure format".  This points you to a location where you read aloud what happens to you and then you may benefit from abilities or make decisions that impact the outcome.  

The game is pretty light and it seems the more outrageous way you deal with an encounter, the better you seem to perform. 

I like the game, but you have to enjoy the story element to the game.  There is not much strategy.  

Be warned that for kids under 12, there are some elements of Tales of Arabian Nights (slavery, violence, indirect sexual references, etc) that may be inappropriate for younger kids.

Interesting storytelling game reminiscent of the "You are the hero". The game makes for a light and entertaining affair with no real strategy other than have fun.

I loved the Choose your own Adventure books and I'm a huge fan of the storytelling aspect of things like D&D. That said this game hopes to emulate aspects of both but results in a random mess. I think I'd be able to go with the random flow if managing all the statuses/treasures/etc didn't become such upkeep. If I had to play again I'd just volunteer to be the reader of the stories.

Understand that this is an experience game. Setup is fiddly and play calls for multiple lookups. Encounter results can be arbitrary. It can run a bit long. That said, it's fun storytelling, and the production is outstanding.

I suppose releasing the book electronically is worrying/trouble for the author/publisher, but automating lookups would go a long way to make this game better. I contributed to an [thread=536347]open-source web app for lookups[/thread] which does what it can short of providing the text.

The new Z-Man edition is clearly a labour of love, but on the whole, this has not aged too well, I’m afraid. While the idea of a collaborative storytelling tool is very appealing and the Decision Matrix coupled to the three results per decision point is a brilliant approach to ensure somewhat dynamic pathways, the lack of consistency that plagues many entries lets it down for me.

As outrageous or unlikely as many of the original 1001 Tales of the Arabian Nights might be, even the voice of Sheherazade herself could not have saved a story where Sindbad happens to discover a secret cave on a ship. His own ship. Such clunkiness prevents all immersion, and without immersion, there’s just not a lot of game here. Consequently, this is an interesting artifact of gaming history, but everything it does has been done better by computer games or tabletop RPGs.

Light on gameplay and heavy on narrative, this game is a pure story-teller. There's really no decision making other than where to go, but the game's fun is to be had in the story that each game tells. Each story offers players the chance to make many different decisions, but the outcomes are mostly random. The multitude of status cards help define the characters, building them as the game progresses.

This is NOT a game for anyone looking for strategy, but it is most definitely makes for an entertaining game night.

There's something hugely enjoyable in this game dripping with silly theme, non sequiturs, grotesqueries and funny anecdotes. Some mechanisms are dated, yes, but the sheer fact that it exists and that I can play it twice a year makes me, as someone who likes narrativism more than anything in games, very contented.

Less "game" and more of an adventure you all go on. You can't play to win or really give a fuck about anything other than enjoying a fun story. But then again, if you can't get with that vibe sometimes then you kinda suck anyway so who cares.

Being a grief stricken ape-man in jail is a pretty shitty way to end up though.

I almost don't bother giving quest cards and worrying about Story points or Quest points during the game, cause the point of the game isn't about winning, so why bother spending 20 minutes on rules that don't really matter anyway. This one is all about the Story book and the Reaction Matrices. I really enjoy the way the matrices correlate to different pages with individual stories relevant to the answers you pick. The math in how that all works out just seems to fascinate me. however, the answers you pick don't really seem to have the outcome you would expect, it's more of a crapshoot. I guess that's good in the sense that you can just pick crazy and wild answers and laugh at the outcome. Very unique.

A story telling game set in Arabian mythology (Ali Baba, Sinbad, etc). Each turn players encounter stories and decide how to respond. Outcomes of stories could include quests, being mainmed, being married, drivne insane, finding treasure, etc. Aim of game is to earn enough story and reputation to meet their personal goals.
Game works best with players more interested in hamming up  a story, rather than trying to win.

A really fun game.  Somewhat hard to control one's fate, but that is part of the enjoyment.  Being evil can really pay off...  Mechanics are straightforward and enough to enable the theme (which is great) to shine.  This game is all about enjoying the story unfold.

Great game when in the mood for something longish that is reasonably light.

RATING: 9
When I was a kid, I couldn't get enough of choose-your-own-adventure books. They provided a simplified RPG experience with more storytelling and less bookkeeping.

Tales of the Arabian Nights does exactly that in a board game, each player taking turns encountering all sorts of fascinating scenarios, attempting to use the skills they've learned to overcome obstacles. What ends up happening is often out of your control and frequently hilarious. The game tells a story about your character that can sometimes be steered in your favor, and other times not, but it is always an entertaining experience that is fun to share with others.

RATING: 8
Seems fiddly at first, but the "gameplay" is really simple.
Roll dice, other player reads you stuff, next turn.

The "game" is only about the stories and i have really enjoyed every story so far. 
Maybe the story doesn't unfold as a story per se, because it doesn't have a beginning, middle and an ending, it is only the middle part all the time, until the game just ends because someone reached the necessary points.

Most of the time i rather play a game over Arabian Nights, but every now and then i feel like reading some funny stories and for that Arabian Nights has delivered.

I rate it this high, because it offers something completely different, it has a lot of variation in stories, items and statuses and it has generated a lot of laughs in a year already.

If you want a game that is about the trip more than the destination, you want a game that doesn't involve competition and you like to read stories, you can't go wrong with this one.

EDIT: 1.7.2016 the game has legs. We still play it every now and then and the stories feel fresh and funny each and every time. Can't recommend it enough really.

Played at BGG.con and loved it...but maybe I was just high on the con.  Or maybe it was just one of those "magic" times that my character's talents and the choices made for her worked perfectly together.  But somehow that time has been the only time that the game hasn't seemed like a totally random "let's read a story together and declare one of the participants the winner" exercise.  I want to love it again...but I think the first time might've just been a fluke.

Great fun.  My opponent(?) described it as "Dungeons and Dragons without all the crap."  I think of it as the game that Arkham Horror wanted to be.

It's not too often that people want to play a two-hour game twice in a row, but the three of us immediately wanted to play again after our first game, and we did.

If we're not in the mood for a brainburner, Tales is a good bet.

Passed on to someone else in my group as I'm moving out of town, and it's a very group-dependent game.

Very unique choose-your-own-adventure game. You're telling a story as you play, much more so than using strategy (which is practically non-existent). Great even for people that don't typically enjoy boardgames. Fun game that my wife and I can play together. Best with a low player count of 2 or 3 people (max of 4)as downtime is long with more people. Works better to just play until you feel like stopping rather than playing until someone "wins" as winning is almost entirely random.

Another truly unique story telling game in which you travel the world of Aladdin encountering the strange and wondrous.

The consequences of your decisions are found in a thick book from which results are read and possibly other options chosen in a choose your own style adventure. The book is so well done, with so many options and such imagination.

The game plays differently every time.  It's a delight with the right group.

RATING: 6
As many have said, this is more of an experience than a game, and I have to agree.  Unfortunately, in both of my plays (with 4 and 6 players), each one outlasted its welcome after playing for several hours.  There was a noticeable amount of downtime between turns, especially with 6 players, and we were all getting distracted and bored by the end.  I can only assume it would be considerably better with fewer players, and perhaps ideal with just 3.  There's decisions to be made every turn, but they have little strategic importance; you're basically just running around world, interacting with it randomly.  While that might sound like a negative thing, there's a ton of story to this game, and it really is a great role-playing opportunity.  With the right crowd and less people, I can picture this game being a great one to pull out for a fun change of pace.

Game in a Nutshell: A choose-your-own-adventure book style game where players explore many strange parts of the world and encounter unpredictable events that never seem to turn out the way you thought they might.

Played as: 3,3 (+1 reader),4 player

Pros: A completely unique game that creates a story like no other board game has ever come close to doing. The shear mass of possibilities is staggering and each one is so well written. Even though there’s a lack of control in the game, it’s still fun no matter where you end up. I’ve spent half the game in a jail cell and had a blast trying fruitlessly to escape (which I never did). Die? Done that, it was a riot! On a separate note, the game is beautifully presented, art and component-quality wise.

Cons: Definitely runs on the long side, and as such, anything over 3 players can quickly become tiresome. Even at that, I think I’ll play with a shortened total of required points to end the game quicker. Speaking of endgame, it’s very anticlimactic. It would have made a big difference if they’d written in some ‘and so he lived happily ever after’ or ‘and wasted away the rest of his years locked in a padded cell’ type conclusion tree that would punctuate the story line. As it is, the game never feels finalized, and you just start putting it away.  And finally, flipping through the book becomes the biggest slowdown of the game. Nothing probably can be done about that, but it still sucks.

Other: I’ve watched two groups of people immediately buy this after playing it the first time. It is possible to see some of the same storylines after only a couple plays as people instinctively always want to ‘attack’ the ‘warfleet’ rather then try approaching the encounter in a new way. So if there’s one word of advice, it’s to never hold back from trying something different.

Best Use: Turn off the TV and try creating your own storyline.

The stories in this are beautifully written, and the variety will keep you going for quite some time. Definitely 90% story, 10% gameplay as others have mentioned, but that's exactly why this game is so brilliant: it's a much more varied, robust version of the Choose Your Own Adventure books I loved so long ago, with an awesome, awesome theme. The girlfriend loves it, and she has been itching to play it again. 

TOTAN will go down a treat with casual gamers, and board game enthusiasts will probably get a kick out of it too. Highly recommend.

One of our favorite games. There isn't really all that much game to it, except maybe trying to get to locations that match your skills. However, it often creates really nice stories and who doesn't want to be vizier or sultan?

We only play this with two. There isn't much interaction and one play with three already had too much downtime.

I like to set myself a certain character scheme when I start. I will pick skills for that and try to choose my actions accordingly, even if in a game sense they seem stupid. This works quite well for me.

My wife tends to rack up the story points super fast. This means that she never suffers from Grief Stricken(?) all that much, whereas it has been crippling for me.

I would encourage to instantly house-rule silly situations like endless suffering from stuff like being Grief Stricken or being Lost. Do check the rules for those things and maybe FAQ, cause the rules can be misleading. E.g. I think you can still walk while being lost.

Very nice game, with pretty components and a large book to keep it replayable. A wonderful way to spend a couple of hours: watching your story and those of your friends unfold... 

If you like storytelling, it's a must. Otherwise, more along: it's (like many rightfully say) an experience, and a very cool one at that, but not really game. You have almost 0 control on what happens to your character, which leads to the winner of the game being determined by luck. However, the game is not about winning at all, it's about the stories.

My friend Cody once died in about 5 turns, not before falling obsessively in love with an demoness who abducted and then abandoned him, and after being shipwrecked by mermen and then taken onto a pirate ship where he was abused and thrown overboard to use as target practice because they found out he had become too insane to be worth anything on the slave market. In my mind, he won the game at that point, because of how incredible his story was. He just shook his head and started up a new character.

We play with what I think is a mandatory fix:  Grieving lasts at most three rounds, including the round in which it is given (in addition to the other rules for removing it).  Very commonly, you get it on the first few turns, then you can't ever "win" any stories to get the points you need to get rid of it.  A fundamentally broken negative-feedback mechanic.

This is one of my favorite games.  It's a story game, and while it does have you going back and forth to look up scenario endings for your character, it's all about the story.

An absolute favorite. Not much of a game, I suppose, but who cares about the steak when the sizzle is this good? With the right group (and thankfully I have a few of them) this absolutely sings. The storytelling is occasionally nonsensical, occasionally maddening, occasionally moving, but is always, always pleasurable to listen to and participate in.

I wouldn't really consider this a game, but rather a great way to pass time with your friends laughing and having fun.  It is a roller coaster from start to finish, one in which you are strapped in and there just for the ride.  Player agency is minimal, as you may or may not have any choice in what happens to you (to any significant degree) but the events that do happen are generally fun and exciting.  Great design with the game flow and excellent for any group that likes a good laugh.  Also, the post-game stories where you recall what happened to your character while filling in the blanks are simply the best.

The book's an insane GM. Best with three people and a few drinks, when someone drops out of D&D night. That said, at higher player counts and/or without a shared willingness to tell your character's stories, not the best choice. Still, a thing of beauty.

I love games (like Android and Arkham Horror) whose function is to build a narrative. Seems like this might be my kind of thing. 

Picked up a copy from Amazon using a Gift Cert. for Birthday 2010.

============================

Thoughts after a first (solo) play. Strangely immersive. I found myself stumbling a bit through the charts and process of looking everything up - at least at first - but the story itself that it seemed to build was spookily NOT random - at least not in the way I expected. Sure, strangely random events occurred, but as I made my choices and read the results of my decisions, there was a thematic continuity to all of it - not a continuity of character or setting mind you - a THEMATIC continuity. In front of my eyes, a story of a young man seeking wisdom and truth unfolded, one where as he learned to rely on his piety and simple faith, he would not only be able to weather storms or overcome challenges, but even inspire others and gain great wealth because of it. The game seemed to be telling me: have faith. The world is a strange and terrible place - one you cannot predict or control, but the pious man, the man of wisdom and faith, is patient, prays to God, and always finds an answer.

It was touching, and beautiful, and I was almost inspired to sit down and write it all out. And then I remembered it already had been. It was sitting on my shelf over there. The Richard Burton edition.

So for what it's worth, the game is a literary treasure.

-----

Right now, relative to Android, which is the only other game I've come across that seems to want to build and develop narrative to such an extent, TotAN does feel a bit more like a wacky choose your own adventure. So while there was a thematic consistency, there was also this lack of feeling of control. It was a roller coaster, and I was along for the ride, rather than an agent of my own destiny. In Android, there is a similar sense of thematic consistency, but players still seem to be able to exert control over the narrative - at least more so than with TotAN. Still, I suspect that I will be a million times more likely to get my wife and extended family to play TotAN than Android, and perhaps that makes it the better game?

Fun game. The point doesn't seem really to be to try to win but just have a good time.  Very unique and a nice change of pace.  Great quality board and pieces.  Can run a little long but you can stop whenever you want or at an agreed upon time and you don't feel like you're missing much.

RATING: 8.5
Fun, impossible to take seriously, goofy, and totally bizarre. This game mostly consists of herping around the game board while terrible things happen to your character. Not a game you want to play many times in a row, but a game that I will never get tired of busting out a couple times a year. 

The only problem with it is that some of the statuses you can acquire are really harsh. Most of them are fine, but the one that makes it so you can't use any skills until you get to 8 story points is insanely rough if you get it at the beginning of the game, to the point where it can pretty much ruin the game for you. We had to implement a house rule on that one, so if you get it before you have 4 story points, it only sticks around for one turn.

This box has a lot of fun in it when you play with the right group, but it is not really a game.  Each session brings lots of laughs and discussion and crazy story-telling moments.

Really?  All the fuss and foaming for this?  I was harshing on Arkham Horror for its lack of decisions and tactical choices, but AH is a deep strategy game next to AN.  Of course, AN apparently is all about storytelling, but the stories are disjointed and make no sense.  My character is traveling overland and gets sucked into an ocean whirlpool?  OK, why not a galactic black hole instead?  A player's choices mean nothing in this game; you can make guesses based on your skills for how to proceed, but since anything can happen, educated guesses are meaningless.  Very often the stories and the events can be intriguing, but detatched from all context, who cares?  Luck conquers all.  A pity, for this new re-vamped edition has gotten a lot of love and is a visual work of art.  Better instead to read the Tales upon which this game was based.

Haven't played this yet but, based on the reviews, I don't think I'm going to enjoy ToTAN as much as I originally anticipated. ToTAN looks akin to one of those kids games where you mix and match pictures of people or animals to come up with wacky combinations but the fun is limited to the rapidly decreasing novelty of making those combinations. At least Arkham Horror and Betrayal had game mechanisms in support of their game narrative. I really can't see me playing ToTAN without also using alcohol or other mind-altering drugs at the same time. ToTAN might have value as a family game for the occassional rainy day. Otherwise, I'd prefer to read a book or play an RPG on my computer.

RATING: 9.1
I think players will either love this game or hate it.... with nothing in between. 
The game is very heavily themed and if you play if for what it actually is: AN EXPERIENCE and not an out & out strategic board game, then you will thoroughly enjoy seeing your character go through the trials and tribulations as they travel the Arabian Nights world. The encounters are very well scripted and always provide laughs from the other players. It plays very much like a fighting fantasy book style adventure and works well with 3 players (one taking the actions, one looking up the encounter charts and one reading passages from the encounter script book). With more players, it could suffer from immense donwtime problems whilst people wait for other players to take their turn, and rushing things by skip reading the text will remove the theme - something to be avoided.
So there it is: for 3 players looking for an expereince it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. For more players, then they need to be patient, and for people looking for a strategic board game - look elsewhere.

I have very mixed feelings about this one.
 I love it for the interesting stories, relaxed game play, and the fun we always get out of playing. I hate it for all the missed opportunities as to what it COULD have been. 
Wish there were an equal ratio of male/female playable characters and that the movement on the board correlated better with the story you receive. Wish the choices we make had some logical connection to the outcomes we experienced. Why are the goals semi-irrelevant? Etc. etc. There are so many elements that could have been executed better. 
And yet, this is still one of the best examples of this genre. We will continue to play...but not that often.

Random events that happen through boring walls of texts for hours. Annoying.
The extensive searching for numbers in a big matrix and book makes it even more annoying.

You need a lot of fantasy to see the totally non-connected story parts as a bigger adventure, the book itself does NOT tell a meaningful story!

I could imagine though, it could be fun if you have good readers that are good at "acting" the stories.

It has a sense of adventure, not the least thanks to the map. I love how your character gets new skills, almost feels rpg'ish. You can bounce back to win, since things take such unexpected turns. After three plays it does feel pretty random & am not sure you can play it well or poorly. Still, I quite like it when you expect a light, fun game. A different kind of game.

This is a game, that really isn't a game. It's like a choose your own adventure book with a light board game element. This may have been a bit less than exciting if the Book of Tales wasn't written very well. I assure you, that couldn't be more wrong. There are so many different outcomes for every encounter and ALL of them are amazing. Does this game excite me with it's game mechanics? No. Does it blow me away with a fantastic theme and crazy stories? Absolutely.

While this game may take a little long, my gaming groups consistently keep playing after the game is over just because it's so much fun to read through the Book of Tales. Very few games have given me as much joy as Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Lots of fun played with the right group: people who like the unexpected, are amused by sudden horrible things happening to their character, not overly focused on winning and losing. The game can run a little long: best with three players (that way everyone's doing something every turn), still good with four. Wouldn't want to play with more as the downtime would start to build....very entertaining and the components are very nicely done.

Nice game with abundant play tokens, nice board and huge book. Clever principles, fluent gameplay but may drag somewhat with 4+ players.
First play was a blast as each encounter was a jump in the unknown. Some of them become recurrent after even a few plays, which is a shame (prison for instance). Also the whole victory condition thing seems pointless as you have very tiny control over your destiny. Pleasure is found elsewhere, seeing the story unfold.
Still a pleasant and original game to play.

Looking forward to playing this one soooo much!

Played it. Mixed feelings. Like the look, the story aspect, and aesthetics. Can't see how much I'll actually play it because actual strategy is low which is fine except there's not much actual decision making. I do like other "spactator" games but somehow this one seems more like a family game to me. Which again, is fine, just not sure how often I'll pull it out despite the amazing story telling mechanic.

Any game which left my non-board game playing housemate in floods of laughter (in a good way) has to be something special. This game certainly is just that. I loved choose your own adventure books as a kid and Tales of the Arabian Nights takes that concept, expands it, and puts it in a board game. A fantastic experience and by the end you won't care who has "won" because everyone's had a good time.

RATING: 4
Tales Of The Arabian Nights is a relic from an age before the advent of the role-playing video game.

TotAN has so little player interaction that it is essentially a solitaire game. Other players involvement is relegated to operating the machine that spits out a result from the players once-per-turn decision. It does provide a limited role-playing experience, while doing away with a D&D-style RPG need for an imaginative Dungeon Master, but severely limits players' ability to affect the outcome of the game.

TotAN should have been converted into a point-and-click adventure RPG back in the 90's where all the fiddly work is done behind the screen by the programming, leaving the player to be immersed in the narrative.

Z-man's updated version has lovely artwork, but is the equivalent of a nicely painted telegraph machine. It might be pretty, but is obsolete to the level of pointlessness.

When it's not your turn you just can't wait for it be your turn (thus I recommend playing max 3 players). It's so easy (and kind of random) to get some really, really sucky statuses such as Ensorcelled, Scorned, or Grief Stricken, which can really make the entire game experience kind of a bad one. And unlike most popular modern games, there is no good way to estimate the length of time the game will take. But there's something wondrous about playing it, the storytelling, trying to intuit how best to react to a particular encounter based upon your available skills. E.g., I have piety, so I'll pray when I encounter the jealous wizard. Or throw caution to the wind, see what happens when you drink the house fire.

I'm loathe to call this a game.  It's more like what they'd call in the Sixties a "happening".  If you go into this "game" thinking you're going to have a winner, you've just lost.  If you go into it thinking you're going to have a *story*, you win.

This "game" is all about creating a story for your character and the weird things that happen to you in your life -- the points system and the "first person home wins" thing is just a MacGuffin.  And it's amusing, but SO MUCH DEPENDS on playing this game with the right people -- with creative folks willing to put in the time to talk between the dots, this game is as good as Munchausen.  Without them, you're playing Agricola without all that wonderful storytelling of the Agricola experience.

Another Book of Tales would help.  And this game has more errata than any I've seen.

The randomness of this game makes it a fun story, but not a fun game.  Someone will be wanting to win, or accidentally stumble into encounters that give them huge benefits for no reason.  Great if you want a group experience, poor if you want to play competitively at all.

Not really a game. I didn't make any meaningful decisions during this. Can be fun if you get into it, but otherwise no big deal. Your skills don't really seem to mean anything when choosing how to handle your situation. Most outcomes are random, and either give lavish gifts or extreme punishment, also randomly. It's more or less several hours of dice rolling. Less to do than Cosmic Encounter.

a game that i will always look forward to playing. It lets you tell dumb stories about how you beat the beggar or drank the house fire and then how you got completely screwed afterward. 

Word of warning though, do not go into this game to win it. There are no strategies, everyone is just subject to the tides of fate, and your role in it is to enjoy the absurd stories that it paints

RATING: 5
Disappointed by this. A string of randomly drawn encounter cards does not make a story. I also felt like too many of the entries in the book didn't even feel linked to the encounter at all, and there was no strategy in trying to pick which skills to acquire or use ... it all felt random. Same for choosing the balance of Destiny Points vs Story Points to go for - no knowledge means no reason to chose one over the other.

Theme is nice though - I wish we'd see more in that setting.

Do not want.

Only played one game so far.  I can't honestly say this is a game I'd want to play a lot.  I'm quite ruthless in clearing out my game collection of games that don't get played much but I'll probably hold onto this one just because of its uniqueness.  It's a clever little game that can at times be very funny.  However, it's a little too long for what it is and some of the encounters don't make much sense.  Like I said, I've only played one game but we had a fair few duplicate encounters in that single session.

I think this is one more for collectors than players, although it'll be the sort of game that gets brought out every now and then for a laugh.

OMG! This is an outrageously fun game! I would say that if you enjoy Betrayal at House on the Hill with its amazing book of haunts, and if you enjoy Arkham Horror for it's endless encounters, then you will enjoy this! The theme is all 1001 Tales of the Arabian Nights and the stories are incredibly addictive and will leave you immersed! Your character will simply journey around the board, but every turn brings you a new encounter and new story! As we are discovering, ZMan games do not disappoint! The huge book of stories and beautiful components are outstanding! 

The game isn't perfect, in some rare cases it can play for a long time with no end seeming likely. For example, my wife and I played a game where we were both sex changed and could not win the game unless we changed back! Never happened...game ended in a draw after 4 hours of game play! Still, we didn't complain...too much fun!

We have found that adjusting the point totals for your gaming needs works really well. For example, in a 6 player game...especially with new players...the game can go really long. So setting the points around 3 story and 3 destiny works quite well. Also, if you are short on time, setting the points around 5 and 5 also works really well. Ultimately though, when we play with 2 to 4 experienced players and we have no limit on time, then we set the points high and have one thrilling journey.

At almost 30 plays of this game...we still haven't made it to all of the places of power. High replay ability!

What I like:
- Well-done game system with strong story element
- Pretty

What I don't like:
- Seemed to take a long time (2+ hrs)
- The story and theme didn't add enough to be worth the convoluted process

It's not a bad game, but leans toward the social, rather than cerebral, experience. Folks were having fun with it, as their characters became slaves or went insane. I would play it, but would prefer something more intellectual. The game system seemed really well designed.

I would put the weight around 2.5, a bit heavier than BGG voters say.

RATING: 5
Fun game but with six players it took five hours, and we didn't even play to a full 20 points (15 instead). It was honestly like 30 minutes in between turns. It dragged on painfully long. I'd give it another go with two players, or three max. Another gripe is that story points and destiny points feel completely arbitrary, and also there is no advantage to weighing one more heavily over the other, but as a newbie there is no way to know this. Your goal in the game is to get a combination of 20 story and destiny points, and before the game you decide what that combination looks like (e.g. 10 of each, or 15 and 5, or 18 and 2) but it would never make sense to overly weight it to one side or the other. I'd say 12/8 max but really I can't envision why you wouldn't just always choose 10 and 10. I guess there is some mystery in that other players don't know which combination you've chosen, but other players also don't have much control over if and when you'll receive points, so it seems pointless. The best part about this game is the Choose Your Own Adventure aspect. That's the only thing that would bring me back to play it a second time.

Looks really good, but after reading rules, I'll definitely need to try this one before buying it.

UPDATE- 

I am so glad I instituted a "try before I buy" policy on this "game". 

THIS IS A LONG FUCKING "GAME"

My first, and ONLY game- over 3.5 hours. I am so close to winning, and more importantly- ending it, at about 2 hours. I'm a turn away from returning to Baghdad and winning when- WHOOPS! I get an involuntary sex change as a result from an encounter. 

I'm thinking...so what, right? 

Except you can't win until YOUR SEX IS CHANGED BACK!  

So...I go back to a city where I have a card, that... IF I'M LUCKY and roll a Friggin' 3... I can then "Enter the Sex-Change Pool". 

I roll.

I ROLLED A 3! 

YES!!!

I choose to respond to the encounter by "Enter". Yes!...I want to ENTER the "Sex-Change Pool". Yes, please. 

At this point, the game has way way way overstayed its welcome for me and I really want it to end.

Anyway, something DIDN'T work out. I wasn't ABLE to enter the "Sex-Change Pool". Although I had ALL the right traits. 

But instead, and get this....I get to fill a flask with the water FROM the "Sex-Change Pool".

OK. Maybe this isn't so terrible...So then please, may I drink this water, so that it will change my sex, so I can win this damn game?

"No."

So...I can't win because I need a friggin' sex change. And...I'm now carrying around a flask with "Sex-Change" potion in it, but I can't friggin' drink it?

Fuck You, Arabian Nights. 

Every logical decision made in this game bestowed a completely illogical response from the system.

A shame, because I very much like story telling. I fully expected to really like this game.

This is not a game. 

And I want my four hours back.

Very different from other board games.  Similar to "Choose Your Own Adventure" books in that you choose an action each turn from a list of options and then another player reads the encounter to you.  If you have something bad happen very early in the game (such as being Imprisoned or Scorned) you can get stuck - which might not be much fun.  The theme of this game fits well and it's easy to learn and appealing to many players.

This is a great game, however Tales and I have had a conflicted past. I played it and immediately thought 'Wow what a great game!' So I immediately bought it!

Then I didn't play it for a while.

Then I got to school and EVERYbody wanted to play it ALL the time! I thought "Cool, everyone wants to play, wasn't a waste of a purchase!" Then they wouldn't stop playing it. So I had to put a lock on the game for a while simply because it was being over played. 

After several months without experiencing it I played it and I remember why I loved this game. Now every once in a while I'm more than willing to pull this game out. A wonderful simple game that's great for families and friends.

This game really feels more like reading a book than playing a game, the real joy is not in clever play but rather in discovery--you really want to find out what happens next.  Thus, the game is better at lower player counts so that you can follow each player's storylines more closely.  That said, there are some statuses that are really over-powered in a negative way and can sap the enjoyment from the game, such as Grief-Stricken or Enslaved.

I think this is a hilariously random game that had potential to be great. It has some flaws (namely the scoring), but it's ultimately a fun game. We had a few rules mistakes which I think would have made the game go a bit smoother and feel less random.

Hardly any decision making at all, this game doesnt give you a chance to look at any context to make a personal choice. Game absolutely plays you which is a drag with the cumbersome way of going through the stories (you need to do a couple of things with the help of preferably 2 other people to figure out what happens to your character after its turn.)

 I dont mind getting screwed over for some light hearted party fun but this one seems weak; you have to make up a lot of stuff to fill in the gaps, which may be its purpose, so you can laugh at the stories and consequences that pop up,but it seems forced. I can see this working for a drunk group however.

Do ignore laminatedlucys bogus negative politically correct review, this game is not meant to be taken seriously and if we corrected every old story, how would we learn the lifestyle and behaviors of our actual past (in other words, we're secluding ourselves with a manipulated history therefore being ignorant of what really happened.) It's pretty much like westernizing or white-washing any current misognistic, transphobic, and heteronormative story from a different culture of todays world.

An enjoyable EXPERIENCE. This isn't really a game. It's more of a "tell stories to your friends with the help of this product" kind of deal.

It can be fun and enjoyable with the right people, especially kids.

Too bad that you can't really affect your destiny (gameplay) too much nor even guess the skills used in some type of encounters. But with right attitude, this is a total success. 

WARNING: Not for competitive players!


Edit: 

A few points of criticism: some of the encounters appear just too often and usually you have no clue which skills would be useful in corresponding story. A bit annoying.

With the right environment - taking your time to enjoy the story with others who are also all on board - this is a blast. Having grown up with Fighting Fantasy and Choose Your Own Adventure books, this game takes me right back there. We still talk, laugh and cry about how my daughter got eaten by a Gooleh two games in a row, almost like it was a real experience. The stories are random nonsense, but in a good way. They're vivid and stay with you...

Completely and utterly random. There is nothing you can do to affect what happens to your character. Also a pretty long playtime. We never usually play til the "end" but simply play to "whenever" and declare the game over once we're bored.

But everyone I play it with seems to like it.

More of an afternoon diversion than an interesting game. The stories you create by making choices from a list of actions are interesting and entertaining though. I had a lot of status cards and it got a bit difficult to manage in our first play. Probably with a few more plays under our belts, it wouldn't be as confusing.

Mildly entertaining. I would definitely house rule to make the game much shorter.

Even though the players are presented with choices, they have very little influence over the outcome and it's hard to predict. So the game is way too random for me.

The individual events themselves are entertaining enough, but not enough to warrant a game of this length. It reminded me too much of Talisman. Better than Talisman obviously, but still not my favorite.

Skill tokens feel very underpowered and I only got to use one once or twice throughout the game even though I tried to base my choices on my skill set.

A really neat game that requires a lot of creativity and engagement on the part of the players. This is not one to just bust out at a party, but rather to build a party around. I've also heard people having a lot of fun writing down their adventures. If you're playing to win, you're doing it wrong.

One of the best family games I have seen. The mechanic of having people rotate the rol of reader and matrix handler is a must so people don't get bored out of their turn. Now, as for winning strategies and such, I would really tell you not to worry about it. This game is not about winning, is about enjoying the storytelling and making it a well acted/told story. If you are looking for a game where strategies would make you win, this is probably not the best one to go for. If you don't enjoy short stories or hate the idea of the traditional arabian setting, don't go for it. I personally find it really appealing and it is one of those games that puts everyone on a very similar level.

RATING: 8
..Not much of a 'game', in the rawest sense.  More of an experience or RPG.  Quite literally, this is a choose-your-own-adventure board game.

On the positive side, this game is truly a wonderful experience.  All of the components are of the highest quality, the art is beautiful, and writing in the adventure book is fantastic - and clearly all of these things were laboriously considered and tweaked for the re-release.

On the negative side (and these are minor for me, but will be major to others) there are A LOT of cards, especially for statuses, that take up a large footprint on the boardgaming table.  The action choices don't really seem to line up with your skills (ie, if you come across an Angry Bandit and you were a swordsman with excellent skill in fighting, don't be surprised if you have to make a piety check in order to succeed an "attack" choice for the encounter).. this disconnect does get frustrating from time to time as players can easily come to learn that a) the skills that they want and want to improve will have little to do with the outcome of their action choices and b) the over arching and over powering randomness to the whole game.

Having said the above, I still enjoy this game.  I love the adventures that unfold and I love that despite playing the game 6 times there are still hundreds and hundreds (and hundreds?) of paragraphs, outcomes and locations that can still be explored.  Wonderful.

RATING: 8
Let's get this out of the way first: if you're looking for a game of applied strategy, go elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a storytelling experience that envelopes you and allows your imagination to run wild, you've come to the right place. 

Absolutely beautiful board and presentation in general. I can't say enough about this: I love setting this one up and diving into the world laying on the table in front of me. Gorgeous. The writing is high quality and done in a style that draws you into the exoticism of the lands and creatures you encounter.

It would be nigh impossible for every single choice and subsequent paragraph to be perfectly meshed, and there are times when the effect is disconnected to your choices. But even these can be fun if you approach the game knowing this in advance. Any choice can be appropriate and you always have an opportunity to be surprised and delighted (or frustrated) by the outcome.

If I could change something at all in the game, it would be this: I would have liked to see a few given attributes for the individual characters you play. Scheherazade, for instance, should automatically have a Storytelling skill, while Sinbad should be gifted with Seamanship from the outset. A minor quibble to be sure, but it makes sense to me. The long playing time can wear a bit as well, but I haven't really minded too much as I was enjoying the stories so much it didn't really matter. 

I love this game. Great fun with the right mindset and the right people. Another one that plays well solo as well.

RATING: 7
I've played a handful of what I call experience games - long duration, strong narrative, chaotic subsystems (e.g Lord of the Rings, Fury of Dracula, Marvel Superheroes) and this is the best so far for me, mainly because mechanically it is easy to get into: move (according to wealth level), encounter, choose response and award.

The other reason I like TotAN is the narrative is done the best way possible: verbally. The other experience games rely on unwieldy mechanics to stimulate the imagination, but I find it doesn't work as well as the spoken word.

Rating based on 1 play shortened to 12 victory points, which clocked in at 1/2 hour per player. Next time will implement the other short play rule of only 1 status in play as more is heady and longwinded for a first time players.

Update: one thing about playing games is that although the conditions of winning may be easy to comprehend, sometimes (or in my case often) the focus on how to reach that victory is difficult to achieve, especially if new mechanisms have to be mastered first. From my first play of TotAN I couldn't see how movement could contribute to victory, it appeared to be a random exercise, though the quest cards provided a distracting, short term goal. Then I examined the encounter deck and realised there is purpose to visit certain terrains.

So I've upped my rating because part of the game is about timing your movement to end on a terrain which will hopefully result in encountering the desired terrain encounter e.g lion in the desert. Obviously it helps in the decision making process if you know what the destiny/story awards will be but the refreshing joy about this design is the genuine feeling of exploring and discovery behind the real mystery of the Palace of a 1000 closets etc. Players can increase their chances of a desirable encounter by either rolling a 6 on the city cards or holding on to city cards to reduce the encounter deck, to recycle the desired terrain or character.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm quite a fan of games that tell a story (although definitely not a role-player) and I like the book-driven mechanic here; the hundreds of paragraphs, made even more uncertain with the addition of the dice variable, ensures that no game is ever the same.  A player's skills can sometimes positively sway an event, but most of the situations are random, albeit with a connection to the terrain space (city, sea, mountain, etc).

I feel that the randomness of the paragraphs detracts from the storytelling power of the game; there is no true connection between the paragraphs, no story progression.  Nevertheless, I still enjoy this a lot, and it gives those players so inclined to ham it up with a few funny voices in the readings.

This was a really enjoyable game where you build a rudimentary character and then move around the board having adventures. The "goal" of the game is to get 20 points in some combination of points and then make it back to the city at the center of the board. The real goal of the game is to just have a wonderful time seeing where everyone's stories take them. The game is sort of a giant multiplayer choose your own adventure book, where each encounter gives you 5 or 10 different ways you can react to the situation. Sometimes, it can be a little ambiguous as to what you chose to do at any point, for example, I had an encounter with "Dark Creatures" and I looked at my options and saw I could pick "Aid". I was thinking this would be 'aid the dark creatures' but as it happens when the book was read I had actually chosen to aid the previously unmentioned victims of said dark creatures for which I was rewarded handsomely. Still fun, but maybe a little confusing. Another example was we had a player who encountered a small treasure. He was like, sure I'll take it, and chose "take". This lead to the book describing a scene of thievery that the player had not really intended. Despite this, everyone had a marvelous time getting into the stories that unfolded. Player's only real complaint was that with 6, the time between turns was a little too long.

Great narrative, but it often feels like there is too great a disconnect between the choices the player makes, the skills required for those choices to work out in the player's interest, and the actual outcome of the choices.

I like its storytelling theme. Your character wanders the land sometimes purposefully, sometimes aimlessly having encounters that enhance the stories one can tell. The encounters the characters experience well capture the feel of the Arabian tales and legends.   

It is not a game to play to win, like a party game it is more of an experience game as you listen to the stories of woe and success. The decision making is rather simple and much of what happens to the character is beyond the players control. Most times the talents you have do not help the character, I use them to set my character's outlook and try to follow it in each encounter for good or more likely for ill. In other words to enjoy, it is best to relax and let the game unfold around you. 

This is one I could see my wife enjoying

A great story telling board game where stuff happens at you and is particularly suitable for family and friends. The more serious board gaming group may not find this so much to their taste but that will also depend on the players. 

A recommend game and well worth a try. The two hour play time is accurate but allow an extra half hour to 45 minutes for your first game so as to get a hang of the rules which fall into place after the first two rounds. Prepare for plenty of matrix checking and reading. 

Enjoy and Happy Gaming :)))

A very accessible game.

One reviewer called it 'a game that consists of random events happening to you, but masterfully so'.

Your choices don't necessarily have much impact on the game, but it doesn't really matter as the game is hilarious.

You could think of it as the ultimate evolution of one of those 'interactive story books'. "Do you open the door? Yes: Turn to page 125, No: Turn to page 354".

Probably Deb's favourite board game - outside of an RPG.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is a pure adventure game.

When a player takes a turn they move based on their wealth, and then have an encounter in the space they've landed by drawing a card.  These encounters can be everything from a disguised princess to a dark whirlpool (take my advice and DO NOT DRINK from the dark whirlpool).  There's some dice rolling and the player chooses how they want to respond to the encounter.  Finally another player reads the results of the encounter to them out of a huge book which literally contains thousands of possible outcomes.  Skills and possessions can affect the encounter's outcome.

Technically players are trying to acquire "story" and "destiny" points in order to win the game, and encounters almost always, no matter how bad, reward you with them.  You can also acquire wealth and new skills.  Or you may end up wounded, accursed, scorned, on a pilgramage, married, a vizier, the recipient of an unwanted sex-change and so on.  All these statuses affect how you can act on your turn.

Players start out with quests.  This gives the game a little bit of structure, but players are under no requirement to fulfill quests, though the quests often provide great rewards.  Winning the game is not the point.  The point of this game is to have grand and entertaining adventures.  The main source of player interaction is when one player reads aloud another's story.  It's a game version of telling stories around a campfire.  It's "Choose Your Own Adventure" the board game.  It's amazingly well crafted and brilliant.  

When an experienced palyer is teaching new players I would recommend having the neophytes just jump right in.  Most of the rules can be explained as they pop up.  I wouldn't recommend playing with more than four people.  The book of adventures is huge and it can take some time to find and read the various stories.  Players have to interrrupt their story for the other players to take turns.  It can be kind of annoying if you have to postpone your story long enough for five other people to experience the next chapter in their own.

Odd Note:  The insert is actually glued into the bottom of the box.

This game is so cool. What? No, that isn't sarcasm. Yes, I know I rated the game a four. But it's true, this game is really cool. It just didn't pan out for my group... like, at all. You see, I'm really great at reading out loud (and no, that is not an "I am very smart" statement), [i]and[/i] more importantly, I think it's fun. Unfortunately, nobody else in my group thinks that (my wife outright refuses to do it, and one of my group is just really, really bad at it so we just end up having to ask him to let us read cards and such ourselves when he does). Even [i]more unfortunately[/i] that is basically this entire game. It has a board and tokens and "skills" but this is, at it's heart, a storytelling game. You move, you read a specific entry from a huge tome of possible scenarios and outcomes, you make your best guess at what you should do, and something good or bad happens. That's about it. But there is a lot of reading out loud, and I think this game lives or dies on a group's willingness to get into the story and [i]read aloud[/i]. My group doesn't much like either of those things, so Tales is pretty much going to sit on my shelf gathering dust, forever.

RATING: 7
Very fiddly. Rating based on one play with two.  May be more fun with a few more people.  Should be a little less fiddly with more people since one person would get the reaction matrix and another gets the book of tales.  With two, the non active player gets both and it seems like too much of a chore.

Amusing choose your own adventure "game."  I put game in quotation marks because there's very little thinking or decisions that matter while playing this game.  The stories are always amusing and is a good time.  However, 5-6 is too many players as there is way too much down time between turns.

I have never felt such pure delight as I did as I sat down to play my first game of Tales of the Arabian Nights.  I love the role-playing and the storytelling.  This game is so different from any other game I've played because there is very little to do in terms of strategy; it's only about laughing and enjoying while the game plays you.  Before I played Tales I would have thought that there isn't much to a game where it doesn't matter who wins.  Perhaps I still think that is true.  But that doesn't mean that this game isn't one of the best experiences I've ever had with a game.  It's pure fun.  I love the theme, the interactive game play and I love that there seems to be no downtime.  There is also no reason for AP.  In fact, I enjoy everyone else's turns as much as my own, which is a rare quality in a game.  It doesn't hurt that the game itself is beautiful--the board, the cards and all of the art is superb.

RATING: 7.5
Maybe it's just because I come from a role-playing background, but I found Arabian Nights to be highly enjoyable. There really isn't much game here. It's mostly a choose-your-own-adventure book with A LOT of random consequences. I think this game would be a little better if if the skills you earn were more closely aligned with the choices you make throughout the game. For example, you would think having the Piety skill would result in the Pray action succeeding more often, but I haven't found that to be the case.

The natural comparison here is Agents of SMERSH, which perfects the skill/choice system, in my opinion. That being said, I think Arabian Nights is still better at the story-telling aspect. Best for a lazy afternoon with a few friends. Overall: lots of fun and a ton of laughs as long as you're willing to let the game lead you by the hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun but flawed. The adventures can be delightful, but there are too many occasions when you are simply not allowed to play: penalties make other people choose for you, or you are stuck in prison for turn after turn, or you must skip a turn. I think this is a huge design flaw, but I suspect it can be minimized with a carefully-chosen house rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rated 8 after first play.  Lots of fun, but think that there would be too much downtime in a game with 4 or more players.

Update : after playing some more I really like this game.  I will say it is very "mood/group dependent".  If you have 3 people that enjoy a casual/noncompetative game and have a little bit of a RPG'er in them, they should have a great time.  It can be a bit long if you play to the recommended 20 point total/combo.  If you think the patience of the players might wear thin after 2 hours, you may want to knock the victory condition down to 16 or less.

I also think it is important to let new players know that they need to relax and let the story flow.  If they are too concerned with winning or losing, or if they are prone to frustration if "bad" things happen to their character (and they will) they will likely not enjoy the game.  Player selection is key for an enjoyable experience.

A pretty good game and it will be popular with casual gamers.  I find it a bit frustrating as the events are pretty random - hard to go for any strategy.  2 plays so far.  The '6' rating is perhaps a bit harsh, with the right group I would definitely play again a few more times but it won't be a favorite.

EDIT: I have tried it with a number of casual gamers and it was not very popular.  Weird - it seems a natural match.  But looking up paragraphs is fairly slow.  I would suggest that you play with a maximum of 3 players.  I am dropping my ratings by a point to 5.

I really enjoy narrative games like this one. When you approach this game from the standpoint of exploring what's happening to your character and the story it tells rather than just as a competitive attempt to win, the game becomes far more enjoyable.

The massive book is somewhat cumbersome, but it's actually pretty well written and nicely made.

Neither good fiction nor good game. The decisions you make are completely meaningless and the results have minimal connection to the action you choose. Fails as a "story" experience because the writing is poor and the narrative is ridiculous.

Z-Man reissue.  Just one 5-P game and one 4-P game so far.  Very impressed, very fun.  Really looking forward to next session.  I suspect it will play better with fewer players.  I would not be in a rush to go to 6-P due to down time.  Much better if played with a role-playing rather than a "gamer" mind set.

played solo and with two, fun for a story but not for those who want a serious game of competition.  If you are looking for heavy theme with light game play than this might be the game for you.  reminds me of a light RPG with chrome although I really don't know much about RPGs.  My wife enjoyed this.  after a few plays some of the same passages are encountered but not that many.  Some house rules are needed as the FAQ doesn't hit every scenario.

RATING: 7.5
It's not just a board game. It's a book of tales which changes throughout the decisions the players make while playing, several times with a result quite different they could imagine.  It's not about strategy, nor taking control about anything... it's about happing fun while discovering the hilarious adventures you and your mates are involved in.

If you don't like the idea of throwing dice and looking for instructions definitely it's not for you. For people with imagination, RPG lovers...

With 2 players it's fine, but better with 3 or 4.

RATING: 8
A game that plays very differently from any other game that I played before. Much reading of text results in many distinct brief adventure episodes. It is a great formula that appeals to everyone I have played it with so far. Lots of luck and, especially at game start, not much chance of influencing outcomes, but this improves in your favour as the game progresses and your abilities increase.

When this game was published I was not sure if it would be my cup of tea, and the price tag prevented me from trying it out. When it was later offered for a reasonable price (by Dutch standards) I jumped on it, and I am glad that I did. Also because I apparently got the second print run with the minor errors already corrected. Good production quality too. This was a very good buy that is likely to hit the table often.

Initial rating after 3 plays: 8 out of 10, with the potential to become a 9.

As others have said it's not much of a game in terms of strategy, which must mean the story and roleplaying elements are strong right? 
Well, the stories are genuinely intriguing but it takes so much busywork to actually get there, even when using an app to assist in page-selection.
Meanwhile the roleplaying is handled in a classic choose your own adventure-style, which i usually love, but so often your choices will lead to unexpected outcomes, leaving you feeling like you have almost no agency in the game. 
In my opinion, play dnd or any other rpg instead, you'll have a much better time.

This reminded me a lot of the Steve Jackson books I use to read many moons ago.  Not so much a game, as an adventure.  Each turn you move your character to new destinations within Europe, Africa & the Middle East.  You then draw an event card and a story unravels before you.  From a pre-scripted selection you can then make a choice on how your character deals with the event.
It is certainly different from any game previously played.  Highly luck driven, its a game not for everyone or indeed every occasion.  
Its more like an expensive Christmas whisky, something to be savoured and enjoyed on those rare occasions when friends get together and want to just enjoy each others company.

The gameplay is rather random, but as many have said before, this is a different kind of experience, facilitated storytelling of a sort. Strictly as a game, I'd rate it much lower, but as a hilariously entertaining activity or a social event, I'm tempted to give it a 10. Your enjoyment might depend on how predisposed you are to constructing and embellishing narratives while playing games. It does not require as much imagination as a storytelling RPG, so it should appeal to a much wider audience. I love this game.

I like that it is a unique adventure game. While it does not reward creativity, it provides a narrative which resembles the original stories and language style. I like that if you use your skills to back up your choices, you tend to fair better. The destiny die throws curve balls at your plans every so often.

This is not a strategy game and winning seems to come from a combination of factors and good choices is only one of them. Victory feels a little more than a timer to let everyone know that the story has come to a conclusion. 

I like TotAN for what it is. A light adventure game in a unique setting.

I still think your best bet is to roleplay your character. Choose skills that make sense together. If you have weapon use, attack people. If you prefer to talk, choose seduction, beguiling, Courtly Graces/Storytelling. If you want to explore, Enduring Hardship, Wilderness Lore and Wisdom or Magic are good bets. 

Grouping the skills is important because sometimes it is ambiguous which one will be used for a specific choice and the Destiny Die may also shift what skill will be used.

This is not a strategic game but it is not mindlessly random either.

Tales is a great storytelling "game" that works really well if your group is okay with basically sitting back and seeing what kind of insane story the RNG comes up with for you. Strategy is not this game's highpoint, but the style of the game is perfect for a night where you just want to have a couple drinks and shoot the shit with some friends or family while your character is sex-changed, doomed, cursed, weakened, and under geas.

Theme is totally rad. The giant book full of snippets from the arabian nights is amazingly cool.

And do not play this game to win or to lose for that matter ... because it ain't happening.

An enjoyable experience, though I could understand the argument that it's not really much of a game. As long as you go into it with the expectation that it's more of a choose your own adventure book that takes place across a game board there's a lot of fun to be had here. 

That said, it seems to overstay it's welcome after about an hour. Recommend adjusting the rules to requiring fewer points for ending the game, since it can easily stretch beyond 2+ hours which starts to feel really long.

For what this is, this is a great game.  An immersive game that does a nice job capturing the feel and fun of the Arabian Nights.  So why is the rating only a 6?  Because I don't see myself playing this week in and week out nor wanting to.  This is a game to be enjoyed sporadically, perhaps as a late night night cap when the fun and silliness of the encounters shine.  So, this will be on my "to play" list, but most likely only a few times a year to prevent it from becoming stale or repetive.  Need to be in the right mood to play (ie a 6 rating) instead of will usually (7) or always play (8).

We enjoy this peculiar, one-of-a-kind, and beautiful!! game a lot. It´s a BOARD GAME, but it´s an "EXPERIENCE" more than a proper "GAME". It doesn´t matter who is the winner at the end. It doesn´t matter THE END, but THE TRAVEL. If you enjoy reading books, and you love "One Thousand and One Nights" classic book (a masterpiece of Literature, very funny and surreal, as well reflect the situations that often occur in this game...), I´m sure you´ll enjoy playing this. The only fault I see over here is the choice of typography, which is extremely small. A perfect game for 2 or 3 players who enjoy reading and listening to fantastic stories.

This would be a perfect ten if they would revise the encounter book to make sense.  No more being in a desert and having an "ocean" encounter!  Also, they desperately need to fix such problems as:
- players should NOT be able to spend three hours in jail in one game.
- players should be more able to get rid of curses
- there should be a GRAND END ENCOUNTER to wrap up the "story" instead of an abrupt, random "oh, I've got points, the end, I win."  This is too abrupt and jarring and is just a let down in such a thematic game.  

Agents of Smersh puts this game to shame, and yet...I love Tales of the Arabian Nights.  I hope they make it right someday.

This game needs an app. Looking up the encounters is just too fiddly, not to mention passing that book *and* lookup chart back and forth. The encounters slowly become more exotic as the the players gain skills. But the usually negative Status conditions result in players not moving around the board and otherwise losing "half a turn". Like other adventure boardgames (eg. Talisman), players almost never interact, so this is best a two-player game.

The Z-Man edition is lush, lavishly produced, with thick, glossy tiles and weighs about a ton.

This game is not for everyone, as it centers in the story that is told and not in the competition between players.  So, hardcore gamers may not like this game, as well as other people that simple don't like stories or that aren't very imaginative.  Besides, for non English speakers playing the game is nearly impossible.  Having said that, I think it is a very good game which departs from a very interesting concept, centered around the amazing way that they've tied all the paragraphs together to form coherent stories. The productions values are one of the highest in the market.  You can see all the care and heart behind the game, specially the Book of Tales.  It is my first Z-Man Game, but I can tell you it won't be the last, if they put this kind of effort in all the games that they make.

Choose your own adventure, as a board game. A rare breed of games that changes the way you look at life, due to its treatment of statuses. In this something that sounds bad may turn out to help you because gaining story and destiny points is how you win.

Con una partida, diré que es un juego que se queda en mi colección porque aporta sensaciones que no se encuentran en ninguno de los otros juegos que poseo.

Un juego diferente a los demás, y por tanto que no sirve para todo el mundo, donde se disfruta del camino y ganar es absolutamente secundario.

No se debe encarar como un juego, sino como una historia, de forma muy similar a como se puede encarar un Sherlock Holmes Detective Asesor.

Es por todas estas salvedades por las que no le pongo una nota superior, aun siendo un juego que me gustó mucho.

My rating is based on playing with my 5 year old daughter.  I ran the game for her in the vein of the old Choose Your Own Adventure books.  She really enjoyed it and to see her excitement when she got a great encounter or her mock fear when something went wrong was really a treat.  Sure, it's a lot of random encounters, but if it makes my daughter happy, it's a winner with me.

Tales of the Arabian Nights -- Played once; four-player.  I enjoyed our time with this non-game, but regardless of how very different the encounters might be, the outcomes were monotonously similar (e.g. Destiny +1 / Story +1).  I will play it with like-minded silly-seekers, but only rarely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A ride best suited for those nights nobody feels like thinking or competing - more of an activity than a game. Mostly it's about random disasters and laughing at other people's misfortune. 

We have it shortened by houserules: play till 15 points sum (no chits at beginning of the game), changes of day phases when first player reaches sum of 6 or 11 points respectively. 

The only problem is the the language barrier.
(still waiting to try the storytelling variant).

"Tales of the Arabian Nights" might tell a good story, but that doesn't mean it's a good game. I found it to be overly random to the point of being chaotic. So much of the game is out of your control as a player due the cards, statuses, and story elements. It's also possible to have lost (or at least significantly put yourself behind) before the game even starts when you need to decide your own win condition by splitting 20 points between the two types of points in the game (story and destiny).  The problem with this is that you have absolutely no idea how to specifically earn each type of point in the game since both are more or less randomly awarded throughout the game game.  So, if you are in the position that you need more story points than destiny points to win, what choice do you make on the next encounter to get more store points?  The reality is that your choice of action doesn't matter because there is no way to know which type of points you'll randomly get during any particular encounter.  Arbitrarily picking a win condition and earning those points in a completely random, unpredictable way does not make for a very fun game experience.  Choosing your own adventure sounds like you have some control in the game, but you really don't.  It gets even worse since there are so many things that put your actions in the hands of other players and there is nothing that you can do about that at all.  On top of that, the game run 30-45 minutes per player and although parts of the story can be funny, the overall story is really quite disjointed.  In the end, the game is too long, with too much randomness and very little control afforded to the player.  This is more of a frustrating activity with moments of laughter than it is an actual game.

Using the Bruno rating system(tm):

"Ach Ja"
Arabian Nights has obviously been made with a lot of love and care. The theme captures the imagination and the board looks great.

"Nicht Nicht"
For me the game is way too random, almost completely so. You really can't predict what the outcome of your choices are. 

I completely understand that Arabian Nights can be a great game for some people, I'm just not one of them. If I want this kind of loose storytelling I play my dear WFRP instead.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Played once with 3 so far. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I knew going in that it was non-strategic, but the gap between choice and outcome was a bit greater than even I was expecting. However, it is still a lot of fun. Some of the encounters become rather involved/lengthy and yield some good stuff. It IS frustrating spending half the game insane, though.

Looking forward to more plays.

Very thematic storytelling game.  Has some RPG elements, but heavy luck factor.  Still a surprising amount of fun.

Update: increased rating by 1.  Enjoyed by both family and friends.  I highly recommend playing that "sex-changed" can be removed by giving a wealth level/treasure to a player with Magic and "grief stricken" can be removed by giving a wealth level/treasure to a player with Magic or Storytelling.  That very much improves the game.

RATING: 7
Not really a game. Almost no strategy. Don't bother trying to explain the difference between destiny and story points when teaching the game, just set everyone's goals at 10 and 10. Fewer if playing with more than 3. 

Don't take let those criticisms stop you from playing this one though. Really a fantastic experience. The epitome of the journey is more important than the destination.

Dad - 1 Thumbs Up. Too random.

Mom - 2 Thumbs Up. Loves the Story.

RATING: 8
Streamlined version of the original.  Quality is improved in most every way, but there are some minor issues that I have with it.  

First, As much as I like the map (and I do like the map for the most part), it just doesn't compare with the original.  This is an aesthetical choice of course, but hey, this is an experience game so it is important.  

Second, in the original, statuses don't stack, so if you get a new status the old one goes away.  This means that you don't automatically lose when you get sex change or stay insane forever never getting control, etc.  This can always be ruled in.

I'm disappointed that they didn't update Blessing and Respected, these have always slowed the original game down and felt anti-thematic to me.  They are really dated mechanics and even in their day made for too much downtime.  That said, we still are at an age where Arkham Horror thinks it is fine to dig through the deck to find a card you want...sigh.

I really like the quest cards in this version.  They are a great refinement.  I think they are imbalanced and should be able to be traded in for new ones in Bagdad, but I like them.  

All in all this is a great edition. I'd pick it up if I didn't already have the original.

I had hopes for Arabian Nights, but my family rejected it for being too long and too completely random.  My kids were sometimes frustrated when they choose what seemed to be the "correct" choice (with skills to back it up) only to be randomly punished.

I only played one game of this at a game convention, but I seriously despise it after just that one play. I understand this is a storytelling game, and normally I can enjoy these, but this was just tedious. I never felt involved... more like stuff just kept happening to me outside of my control, and a friend playing was pretty much negated for most of the game because of a card effect. The cross-referencing the story guide was just tedious and fiddly, and over-complicated in my opinion. I was glad when this game was finally over, and there aren't a lot of games I feel that way about. I will not be playing this again.

What more needs to be said about TotAN? Too many of the "modern" games that I see hitting the tables these days are little more than heartless mechanical exercises that ultimately have little function other than to provide a reason for 2-6 people to sit around a table to see who can follow the rules most efficiently. TotAN is the exact opposite of that style of gaming - it's passionate, colorful, enchanting, and one of a kind, full of surprises and outrageous fortune. A multiplayer choose-your-own-adventure game rooted in the mythos of the 1001 Arabian Nights and an Ameritrash classic to boot? Yes please.

Hahah, well -- I'm not sure how much of a game this is.  Whoever wins or loses doesn't seem to be that important or rely on much skill.  It's a storytelling game and the fun part is whatever happens during the game.  At the end, it was fun going over what happened to each of us -- myself, a battle in the magical beast wars, and my son married to the sexy daughter of a beautiful princess.  I can't imagine playing it more than a few times, however -- it is fun for the occasional entertainment.

Played with the right group, this can be a gaming experience you will never forget - mind you though - with the right group. There is a great deal of reading passages in a hefty book, so, not for folks who don't read english well, or those who do not enjoy reading. The stories should also be read with flair, so monotone readers may put a damper on things. The other aspect that may kill this game for some is that it is largely a random romp through Luckland. Truly, the choices you make, no matter how logical they seem, will certainly influence the outcome of the situation, but for good or ill is anyone's guess. Your character may have all the necessary skills that fit a situation perfectly, but there are times when not having the skill would leave you better off. So why strive for developing a character with more skills and more experience when those attributes may not actually help, and may certainly hinder your character? Well, because when playing this game one must simply let go. Let go of all the notions of traditional strategy games and tactical euros. Let go of competition and logic - and instead ready yourself for a fun, chaotic, funny ride where if your character becomes lost, or assumes beast form, who cares? If it's good for the story, then it's good for the game. Just let go and enjoy the ride - it may not make sense, but it certainly makes for a joyful time.

Interesting match of Choose Your Own Adventure and a boardgame.  It's definitely more about the journey than the destination, as there is a tremendous amount of randomness.  While I'm impressed with the number of different tales, I wonder if the game wouldn't become stale after a handful of plays.  It's a bit longer than it needs to be, which also drags the rating down some.  In order to minimize downtime, fewer is better with this one, and 3 is likely the sweet spot.  Still, this game seems like it would really appeal to those that like both boardgames and RPGs and it certainly provides a unique gaming experience.

Couple of plays, now (Jan 3rd, 2010)...

This game is a LOT of fun, tons of laughter and good goofing.  But, it's not one I'd always want to play -- need to be in the right mood.

Still, awesome stuff here, and I think an integral part of my game collection, now.  I can see playing it quite a bit over the coming months, then likely only rarely after that as it would become the sort of thing to break out on special occasions with the right people.

We'll see if that expectation bears out or not!

This game is just a lot of fun with the kids.  They love it.  I'd much rather play this than Monopoly when you want to play a family game but your brain is too fried to play something strategic. I was crippled, insane, and envious when Emily forced me to "Take" the flying horse.  Because I was crippled I couldn't hold on with both hands and fell to my death just as I was about to win the game!  She loved it, and laughed herself silly at my demise!  Good Fun.

I played this again, at my kids request, since we hadn't played in a number of years.  They are older now.  I have to say it was a blast and we had a lot of fun with each other.  I think the game works best with three.  As such I upgraded my rating on this.  It isn't a deep game by any stretch but I have never played a game that wasn't memorable for whatever happened in the game or the social interaction that results.  Good clean fun.

Tales of the Arabian Night is not a normal game. There are lots of random and uncontrolled elements and if players are only playing in order to win they'd better stay out of it. It's a unique experience a game among games. I've never played anything alike. The book of tales is superb! This rating has nothing to do with my willing to play the game but with the brilliancy of it. It's very difficult to make such a game with such interest.
Playing the game could actually not be fun at all for some players. Some elements of the game can make the experience not that much interesting and kind of boring. Being imprisoned is not that fun nor is to be married!

RATING: 7
Things just happen to you and there's very little you can do about it, those things also happen to other players so you can just laugh at them and have a good time. For example, a player encounters a prophet and opts to aid them. They're rewarded by being mugged by said prophet. There are also a lot of seemingly nonsensical actions, such as entering a rhinoceros or robbing a volcano or drinking an altar, which also produce a lot of laughs.

Really hard to get on the table despite how funny it is. It might be too heavy for what is ultimately a "comedy" game.

I'm a fan of the "choose your own adventure" see what happens and role with it mechanic, esp. if combined with a bit of liberty-taking story-telling.

Liz, however, quite fairly said "where's the game?". She has a point. If you felt your decisions were actually in any way informed, it'd definitely help!

RATING: 6
To me, this game is unnecessarily cumbersome. To provide a vaguely linear "story," it depends on players having to consult and cross-reference and adjust various matrices; this gives you some choices to make but really a simple instantaneous draw of some kind of Event card would have sufficed and been much less fiddly, more than making up for whatever minor loss of continuity you might suffer. Then there are the many status modifiers you must keep track of (a personal pet peeve of mine)...it's not a bad game, just a little too clunky to work as a free-wheeling adventure. When you have so little control of what becomes of you, maybe it's best to make things easier and quicker.

RATING: 2
While the story that unfolds before you can be very entertaining, this game has many drawbacks.  The encounters are randomly drawn and the effects that happen to you are randomly applied based on skills that you randomly chose.  The skills that apply to the encounter usually don't even relate to the encounter!  The story itself, while entertaining didn't follow any coherent path.  The rewards for each encounter seem to be randomly distributed also, so there is absolutely no strategy to this game.  The effects that are often applied to your character can be debilitating and very hard to overcome.  Game time is way too long as well.  There could be so much to improve in this game and make it an enjoyable experience.

A very unique storytelling game. Many of the situations that occur are intriguing, if not outright hilarious. Players have some choices, but they are pretty arbitrary, and the outcomes of those decisions are very random. As long as people go into the game expecting a funny story, and not a strategic experience, they'll have a good time.

This game is a masterpiece, but don't play it to try to win. Play it to experience the stories, both the good and the bad. I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas 2013, and we spent all of New Year's Eve playing it. We eventually just decided to play until we filled the Destiny and Story tracks and stopped there because you couldn't get more rewards.

Trying to rate TotAN is a complex problem. As a competitive game, it would fail miserably, with too much luck and too little interaction for its length. As a collective experience, however, with the right group, it is superb.

The game isn't technically cooperative (there is only one winner), but I personally see it as cooperative, with the goal being to generate an interesting story, to which each player contributes. Judged that way, it succeeds beautifully.

The thing that strikes me first is that I cannot even begin to imagine how much work went into creating this game!  It is fairly epic!  My rating is based on a single 3-player game that I played in order to get the rules down, which was easy enough to do since it just takes a turn or 2 to get into the flow of the game.  I had read about how random this game is and how it is simply a story-telling adventure, but that was okay with me since my wife and I love stories and adventures!  However, even with fairly low expectations I was still disappointed.  It really is INCREDIBLY random, to the point where you feel like there are almost no meaningful decisions to make since every reaction to any situation could end up being good or bad, or both.  It's like being in an out-of-control car, but without the excitement.  And even though I approached it as being similar to those "choose your own adventure" books I loved as a kid, I still felt let down because there is nothing linear or story-like about the adventure - it's just one random event after the next.  I can see why 3 players is the ideal number (and I wouldn't want to play with more than 4) since the game would really start to drag otherwise.  But having said all that, the production value is excellent and the components look very nice (yay - a blue sea on the map!).  My wife seemed to enjoy the game more than myself, and I would definitely be willing to give it another try now that I know what to expect.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

RATING: 6
Rating this one is hard because I'd put it somewhere between 3 and 8 depending on the crowd. It's more of a ludic storytelling experience than a strategy game, and I wouldn't want to play it with everyone. With the right people? Amazing.

The story book is somewhat frustrating and reminds me a lot of Ambush!, the computer strategy game for chumps without a computer. Really, an iPad version of Tales with full voice recording would be about a thousand times better -- everything goes needlessly slowly because of the time it takes to look up encounters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Wow, I wasn't expecting such a verbose rule book for a lite game, and one that is often recommended for families. There is no way any non-gamers I know would make it through this rule book. The point chits are also the biggest waste of cardboard componentry I've ever seen!

Aside from all this it was initially fun but the accumulation of character penalties over time really dragged the game down. The humor wears a little thin eventually too leaving my overall impressions a little disappointed for such a highly regarded game. 

Although a good "game", it's certainly overrated in my view. 

And if anybody is not clear, this game is ENTIRELY PURE LUCK. Control of your destiny is an illusion. You have been warned.

Great theme play!  Easy to learn and play.  Nice flavor text on the 'tales'.  Heavy luck factor in the outcome of the tales.  Game would play better & faster if the number of afflictions was limited to two or three.  Components are excellent - mounted board with very good artwork and glossy finish, great flavor text, thick cardboard playing pieces, durable cards with a glossy finish and thick player boards/aids with a glossy finish.  Game length is about 3 hours which feels a bit too long.

RATING: 10
A marvellous experience. the whole production is amazing from the cards and board art work to the incredible bound book of tales. The amount and weight of the game suggests extremely complicated, but it isn't. After a few turns it becomes clear how the game plays though the choices to be made are almost limitless and therefore replayability endless. Not just an incredible game but the feel of being in a real Arabian Nights adventure. A stunning and unique masterpiece. NOTE have found the same anomaly as other players in that taking the rules as written, it is impossible to enter the noon and evening phases. Not a massive problem, simply create a house rule to change the time of day after each round of turns. I just find it strange how something so obvious appears to have been overlooked whilst the attention to detail in all other aspects is startling.

RATING: N/A
TotAN was not as much fun as I'd hoped, but that's probably because we played with five. Too much downtime between turns. Also, there's the old-school tendency to get bogged down with alot of cards -- each of which tell you things you must or cannot do. Gets very busy and kludgy. Finally, there's no real immersion in story. Crazy Thing A happens to you...then Crazy Thing B happens to you. Etc. The segues are not only unsatisfying, they're non-existent. A bunch of silly, unrelated things happen to you for a couple hours, then it's over. If you can believe it, I think Talisman gives me a stronger bond to my character, and it's no more random than TotAN.

Daughter (and son) is absolutely in love with this middle eastern quest game (to the point that I have now ordered Pathfinder beginner set on the anticipation they would be interested in a bit of role playing). The theme is so full of fun that you ignore the annoyance of getting those status cards which can screw the rest of the game for you. I am definately house ruling that players can still win if sex changed and ignore the 'bidding' for the make up of how you will score the '20' in destiny and story points.I think 3 is the ideal number for this as I can imagine 4 will drag out with some of the player turns taking a wee while. A unique and fun game.

I knew this was going to be an 'experience' game as opposed to one with any actual gameplay, but the experience of listening to generally dull passages of flavor text that form a long and generally incoherent story wasn't worthwhile.  Especially given the huge time investment.  Its amazing to me that there are 120 markers that serve only to mark an essentially random choice at the start of the game.

My rating is reflective of playing the game to full length.  It just takes too damn long.  If you set a 90 minute time limit on this one, I'd rate it a 7.  I love the gameplay, but it just drags towards the end of the game.

RATING: 6
Growing on me slightly. Still very long and random though, to say nothing of certain effects (sex change, anyone?) that can make the game practically impossible to win. An early effect like that makes for a long, long game.

Also, the rewards seem almost entirely random. One player might luck out early and gain 2 skills, and then start a cascade of good encounters and gain more skills. The rich get richer and it's really quite random. This seems more in line with social games like Dixit or Apples to Apples, except several hours longer.

Update: this game should just not be as long as it is. Goodness.

RATING: 6
Highly thematic and highly random storytelling game. Players take the role of one of the characters from 'The Arabian Nights' and manoeuvre them around a point to point map of Asia, North Africa and southern Europe. When landing on spaces a card is drawn revealing a particular type of encounter specific to that type of space. Players then decide on how to react to that encounter based on a number of options. The result of the encounter is then obtained from an impressively comprehensive list in the game's 'storybook'. Points are awarded depending on the outcome of the encounter and the winner is determined by reaching a certain number of points on two tracks and a player being able to return their character to Baghdad. 'TotAN' is an incredibly random game, in fact it isn't really a game in the traditional sense, whereby you have some control over what happens. As the player you just have to make a guess as to which action will lead to the most favourable outcome for you. This is therefore a game that should never be played with anyone who insists on there being a strong competitive element to proceedings. With a group who understand what the game is designed to do, namely tell a story, and who aren't troubled by the notion of winning and losing, this can be a highly enjoyable experience.

As a "6" it means I'm slightly positive about playing the game; I am not big on role playing games. In terms of mechanics and overall design this game is very impressive. If you like paragraph games, or dungeons and dragons types of role playing games, you will likely be impressed. It's the only para. type game I recall where the look up were easy, and the rules were unambiguous. We had no problems playing this. As a strategy game, there's not much here. You have to enjoy the narrative flow. This thing really delivers the narrative.

This game is easy to learn and it is dripping with theme. There is definitely some randomness to the game, but that doesn't mean you don't make any meaningful decisions.

This is a game that you don't care if you win or lose, you just want to hear each player's stories.

One thing that might bug people is that there is a lot of bad stuff that happens in this game. It's definitely not a "cheerful stroll through life" type of game. You could end up like my buddy, beaten multiple times, crippled, grief-filled and envious. I even died in a game.

I don't really know how to rate this game as it almost isn't a game. People had explained to me before that it is essentially a 'choose your own experience' book with a board attached. You make some arbitrary decisions and 'stuff' happens.

Having now played it, the choices aren't as abstract as they were sold to me; if you have a few skills (you start with 3) the options available to you in each encounter can be tailored towards the skills you have which will tend you give you more positive results than randomly picking an action. However, the pull to choose the silly or funny option is often overwhelming and the game might punish you a little for doing so, but it probably won't guarantee you lose the game.

It's actually one you can play to win, but it almost (almost!) doesn't matter. It really is an experience - and that's from a Eurogamer.

This game is a little long for what it is.  I believe that I might actually play a variant to 15 points most of the time.  At least, I'll give it a shot once and see how it goes. 

Also, I feel some variant with the encounter cards is in order.  In a three player game, we weren't close to getting through the deck.  I think maybe cut the deck in half, and put the midday token in the middle of the deck.  Then the night token at the bottom for reshuffle time.  So that you get to the tokens a bit faster.  And there's a little more game variety.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is a very interesting Choose Your Own Adventure game.

Even failing miserably can be quite entertaining!

Playing [thing=172818][/thing] made me want to try out the definitive story telling game.  So far I'm not sure what to think.  The whole story and destiny point thing felt completely arbitrary.  I know this isn't a game that you should be playing to win, but I felt like I had no direction at all.  My quest was to try and get 2 story points at a time, but I had no idea where to go or what choices to make to accomplish the goal.  My wife at least had a quest to go to 3 locations, which I would have greatly preferred.  

The story telling is good, although not quite as good as I was expecting.  The stories are still fairly short and don't give you much to base your decision.  But, some of the results are really entertaining and they give you different statuses that are also entertaining.  Playing with 2 players felt a bit overwhelming because I was constantly flipping between 3 books to see the different options and outcomes.  It might be nicer with 3 players to share that burden a bit.  I'm also not a big fan of the theme.  If this were a classic fantasy setting, I'm pretty sure it would instantly be in my collection.

Originally, I purchased this as a whim - and a bit of the cult of the new (or would that be the cult of the reprinted?)

Highly suggest that when playing this you let players know that you play this "for the ride" and not the destination.  I've found the game more enjoyable for all that way.

"Not the destination, but the journey" game. If you want to have a relaxed, fun time then this game provides it. Especially recommended for couples.

This is neither a cooperative  nor a competitive game. There are winning conditions, but I believe they are just there for the purpose of ending the game. You can set a time limit instead, and it creates the same experience. 

==Not for you if==

If you can't get out of a competitive mindset while playing board games, or if you only enjoy competitive games then this game is probably not for you.

I believe people who criticize the game with the argument "your choices don't matter" are the ones who are playing it to win. Your choices do matter, different things happen to you based on your choices. It's just that they might not work the way you expect them to work (it's a fairy tale land after all). This probably frustrates the people who are playing it to win.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is an experience game, but there's little strategy beyond a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  This is strongly recommended for children who can read, because they can burn up hours referencing and cross referencing the myriad reference materials.  TotAN will probably achieve classic status in that fashion.

It's a unique, uncluttered, fun, and occasionally hilarious (mis)adventure.  Honestly, it's not much of a game, but I don't think it strives to be one.  What it strives to be is a random story generator and it excels at that.

One thing I don't get, though, is why I barely get halfway through the morning version of the Encounter deck each game and I've only once seen a person reach a Place of Power.  Seems like there's a tonne of content in that Book of Tales that I'll just never be able to reach.

What a magical and wonderfully mesmerising game this is. Definitely not for everyone as this is essentially a 'Choose-your-own-Adventure' Storybook intertwined in a truly mystical Arabian setting.

It oozes with atmosphere and flows with theme in both art & design, but only on the strength of the players imagination and storytelling abilities.

Nether-the-less this is beautiful fairy tale of an adventure and a magically charming game in the right hands. I can't wait to start reading/playing this game with my little baby daughter once she starts reading :)

Eventhough this game came out in the mid80's it has a certain "Euro" feel to it...but also contains a lot of craziness and luck. I love the idea that your story can enter a cycle of predetermined randomness. It is just a geat game to own. My only advice is to play with at least 3 people. 2 works but there is too much going on with components.Also I recommend getting a little card sleeve book to hold the status cards. They can be a bit of a pain to handle at times.

Silly, silly game. It should not be taken seriously at all. There's no strategy. It's just a ride in a story, buckle up. If you realize that's what's going in, you can have some silly, silly fun. If you're looking for meaningful decisions, or any form of strategy, stay far away.

UPDATE:

I've played it a little more and I've learned that there are good moments for this type of game. Just to sit around and laugh at funny little stories. The game plays you more than you play the game, and therein lies an adventure. Great for families everywhere.

Upped my rating to a solid 7.

I had high expectations with this game. While I like it after playing it, I rarely want to bring it to the table somehow. I think I am a bit disappointed on how its potential on the board is wasted by very few -almost none- mechanics apart from the narrative aspect. I would like to DO something on the board of a board game, even if reading is a huge part. Which brings me to a second issue: the game takes too long because you have to search in a huge book for the appropriate paragraph. Of course you need a big book, otherwise it becomes stale superfast, but I was hoping for an app or something that would give me the text without forcing me to turn pages like a madwoman. That said, it was quite fun and enjoyable, but more like a "choose your adventure" meets board games type of thing.

I've played this 5 times, but won't give this a rating yet as I have never actually played it as a competitive game.  My niece just like to go adventuring. Sure we collect the attributes, but we just end it when we feel like it.

The game is great fun and the production is amazing. I do look forward to getting a group together and giving it a proper play.





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

RATING: 7
Unique and gorgeous component wise, the stories are coherent and if you pay attention and choose actions that are related to your abilities you will definitely have much more success, which proves this wasn't just designed willy-nilly.  It's fun and unique and even in 2017 I don't think another game has really done the story based game better.

That said the rules seem half baked on several points, I don't mean that there is ambiguity just that they seem...stupid?  For instance only cycling the morning/day/night counter when you finish the encounter deck?  What?  You'd have to play absolutely horribly and for over 5 hours to get to night time...it will legitimately never happen.  The win condition rules seem arbitrary and at the same time too easy to obtain as well.

In essence the game lends itself to several house rules to improve the experience, which I have to hold against the game a little bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not exactly what I was expecting. More Bethesda's Elder Scrolls than Bioware's Baldur's Gate...meaning you make your own story from a series of disjointed mini adventures rather than have a linear cohesive story told to you. Often short paragraphs that aren't engaging or meaningful to your skillset or reactions and many rules issues, which can be easily house-ruled or ignored. Played very similar to World of Warcraft Adventure Game to me. This is NOT "Choose your own adventure" in the sense of those books because it's not telling one story. Your choices are generally only to choose a random location to stop in (often with no rhyme or reason to go there) and then to choose a reaction, such as pray, rob, honor, examine, hire, etc. One paragraph or mini adventure does not lead you to the next or continue your story or experience. Generally the paragraph will result in you gaining a point or two and possibly taking on a "status," which can be good or bad. Travel to another random blip and repeat. This is OK for what it is. If you want more of a single story that has all the "Choose your own adventure" elements as in those books or the Microquest Death Tests, try Cutthroat Caverns: Tombs and Tomes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It was a fun "game". I would say it's more of a choose your own adventure with points, but  there are some interesting story points. I wish there was a bit more way to accurately predict what might happen or what skills might be useful in different scenarios, but with 4 players it wasn't bad. I think 3 players would be the ideal length and engagement.

The storytelling experience game is popular with some people. To me, I barely feel like I'm playing.

I have heard this game described as The Mother of All Choose Your Own Adventure Books. An accurate depiction. This is absolutely a story telling game, with more theme than game. I recognize that it is not a game for everyone, and you have to be in the right mood to play. Having said that, it is a lot of fun if you immerse yourself in the tale. Rescuing princesses, fleeing powerful wizards, beating old hags (I actually felt bad after doing this). It is very fun to watch the story unfold and laugh at the misfortune of yourself and others.

This so called game is just a choose your own adventure story on top of which are layered a number of meaningless activities one repetitively engages in until someone randomly "wins" this game or, more mercifully, you simply quit.  

I cannot imagine a better way to rip all the joy of life out of one's soul and stomp on it than to engage this activity someone mistakenly labeled a game.

RATING: 7
[thing=34119][/thing] is a pretty simple game: the characters travel in a map, having encounters in its several locations, and in each of them the player chooses what the character will do from a set of options: for instance, Aladdin encounters a Wicked Enchantress, and the game informs that to deal with her Aladdin must use one option from the table B, which has: Grovel, Aid, Rob, Avoid, Bargain, Attack, Court, Trick, Hire. Then, lets say I choose "Court", since my Aladdin has, as skills, Seduction, Storytelling, Appearence and other that might be useful (in the beginning of the game, every character starts with 3 skills from 18 possible).

After this, is simply a matter to cross the choice made (Court) with the "Wicked" line in a table of the letter (B) given in the encounter. This will give a number to go in the big book of encounters - for example, say it is 1609. Then, the player rolls the Destiny die, which can make the encounter happens one number bellow (1608), one number up (1610) or in the actual number given (1609) - if the player has a "golden" skill (meaning that the character is a master in that skill) and this skill appears in one of the three possible encounters (bellow, the same or above), the encounter that will happen will be the one that uses this master skill. In the reference of the encounter is written what happened and there are, usually, two possibilities: in the case the character didn't have a required skill or item that the encounter requires, the player reads the "No skill" part; if the character do have the skill or item required in the encounter, it is read the part that takes this into consideration - and, of course, in this way the character gets the best results. Once the encounter is over, normally the turn passes to the next player. And the game goes like this until it ends.

The encounters give, usually, one or more of four things: Story points, Destiny points, Treasures and/or Conditions. The Story and Destiny points are what makes the game end and a winner appears (at the start of the game, every player must divide 20 points between Story and Destiny anyway he wants, like 10 / 10, or 13 / 7) - when the character reaches the amount of points chosen in Story and Destiny, the characters must reach Bagdah in order to win. Treasures are pretty useful items. Conditions can be good or bad, like Married, Chased, Cursed, Transformed, Fated, Scorned, Respected, and several others, and each has their own special rules.

Besides walk around the world and get stuff, the characters can also travel in order to fulfill Quests, and each has their own set of rules and rewards when completed. After a Quest is fulfilled the player receives another, and is in the best interest of the player to try to complete these Quests, since they give a lot of good things, and also provide a sense of direction to go with the character instead of just wandering around the map, whithout a bigger purpose. Besides this, some encounters give the player city cards, and aftwerwards, when the character reaches the said city, after the encounter there, you can discard the city card and roll a d6 to see what will happen with the character there (usually you can gain or lose items, or have another an encounter there).

[thing=34119][/thing] showed itself as a fun  game, providing many memorable situations throughout the whole play. But a few warnings are necessary: first, the game comes with a [u]huge[/u] downtime - between turns, the other players usually have nothing do to besides listen to the encounters of others (eventually one are required to make some choices for the other player). This truly makes BGG correct in the "best player count", since three seems to me to be spot on to reduce the downtime to a more manageable amount. [thing=34119][/thing] with 5 or 6 persons will probably a nightmare in the downtime front.

Second, is important that everyone knows that the game isn't really a competition. If you want to strategize and likes control, maybe [thing=34119][/thing] isn't a game for you. The results of the encounters are unpredictable, even if you try to make the best use of the skill of your character - for example, in one situation, Ali Baba's player choose to Attack some evil creatures, since Ali Baba had Weapon Use and Magic, so he thought he had some bases covered, but, once the encounter happened, he needed to do a trap, using Wilderness Lore, which he didn't had, so Ali Baba was beaten and scorned. Not even making conservative choices (accordingly to the situation or the skills your character has) guarantee any sort of better success rating than just playing almost at random. Also, in some situations, it is the other players that decide things for you (such as which places is necessary to visit in order to fulfill a Quest), and, if the game is seen as a competition, it would be in your best interest to put the places as far and wide as possible, to make the completion of it pretty hard. But the game loses with this, since it is way more fun to actually see the end of the Quest, to see the effects of it, specially because these tend to be the most thought out and fun encounters to have.

[thing=34119][/thing] is a game that has a place mainly of its own: its is not a game of competition, but is also not a cooperative; it is a game in which the main thing are the stories told, but it isn't a storytelling game (you don't have to have savvy in telling stories on the spot, like in [thing=18723][/thing] or [thing=1234][/thing], nor do you have much control on the story as you have in [thing=12692][/thing]); it is a game without great demands in rules, with low complexity, though it isn't as simple or direct as, say, [thing=39856][/thing]. So it is possible to trace several parallels with other games, but none that can embrace the whole extension of [thing=34119][/thing].

Therefore, [thing=34119][/thing] is certainly not a game for everyone (it is long, with severe downtime, and, in the quibbles department, the box is huge and weights like if it is full of rocks, and this is mainly due to the big book of encounters, lots of cards and the thick board), but is indeed, certainly, an unique game, capable of creating stories that will be remembered for a long time.

Out of all the games in my collection this is probably the one that impresses me the most.  The Book of Tales is just incredible, there are enough interesting paragraphs in there to last a lifetime.  As long as you don't care about winning, and you're in the mood for an entertaining story, this game is a great and unique experience.  There are some mechanics that are very fiddly (especially the six-step process it takes to actually get to each paragraph, which becomes exhausting after a while).  It also takes a lot longer than it should in my opinion.  The game is certainly not without flaws, and it could certainly use some streamlining, but I love it because of the fantastic stories that this game makes possible.

eesh.  well, we wanted to love this one so much.  and it failed to deliver.  too fiddly for one (this we could tolerate if the game was great), and decisions and skills did not match up with results often enough.

court the maiden?  sounds fun.  what?  i get mauled by a tiger?

rob the ugly beggar and get "pious"?

to top it off, it was too adult for the kids, and not adult enough for the adults (you seemed to get punished for "bad" acts in general, which limits the storytelling/role playing).

there's a great game somewhere in this mechanism, but this ain't it.

This is a good experience "game".  It has a pretty big time commitment, and there isn't much "gaming" during that time.  This is ultimately a choose your own adventure with a board involved.  If you play games of this too close together, they may start to get old on you.

Great 2-p experience with a daughter. Must be willing to "get into" the idea of building a story & having fun with it; 'what will happen next" discovery keeps it going.

Just finished playing our first game.  It took a few turns to get down the flipping through charts but that soon became simple.    You don't have as much control over your character as in other adventure type games but that's because you're following what the charts tell you to do.  It's kinda like a choose your own adventure board game.  I had a lot of down time during the game as a spent almost the entire game "Insane" but, that was just coincidence I think.  Not once in the game did we use the "Treasure" cards so I still have not seen all the game has to offer.  I think that in our game we might have read the same paragraph twice, but that's a maybe.  The real replayability of the game comes in the vast array of paragraph options.  The true potential of the game really shows when the players role-play and/or add-lib to the paragraphs that get read.  Lots of room for the imagination to run wild.

Only two plays so far. It was very well received by the audience I purchased it for (extended family), but did not go down so well with my friends. It's a bit of a mixed-bag it seems, with people either loving it or hating it.

In Tales of the Arabian Nights, you are the hero or heroine in a story of adventure and wonder just like those told by Scheherazade to her spellbound sultan! You will travel the land seeking your own destiny and fortune. You will learn stories and gain wisdom to share with others. Will you be the first to fulfill your destiny? The next Tale is yours to tell! There is, of course, a winner in Tales of the Arabian Nights, but the point of the game is less to see who wins and more to enjoy the unfolding and telling of a great story!
In this new edition of the groundbreaking storytelling game, you enter the lands of the Arabian Nights alongside Sindbad, Ali Baba, and the other legendary heroes of the tales. Travel the world encountering imprisoned princesses, powerful 'efreets, evil viziers, and such marvels as the Magnetic Mountain and the fabled Elephant's Graveyard.
Choose your actions carefully and the skills you possess will reward you: become beloved, wealthy, mighty - even become sultan of a great land. Choose foolishly, however, and become a beggar, or be cursed with a beast's form or become insane from terror! YOU will bring to life the stories of the inestimable Book of Tales in this vastly replayable board game with over 2002 tales that will challenge, amuse, astound and spellbind you for years to come.

Fun Roll Playing Borad Game.

Choose character skills, choose reactions to encounters, hear crazy stories, and fulfill your destil, all while trying to stay out of jail and avoid negative status effects.  

Some encounters happen more often than others, and I havent seen even 10% of them yet.  There are thousands of possible encounters, so just hope that your character has the right skills for the reaction you choose.  If in doubt, get piety and prey a lot.

It is one of the games I would definitively suggest for one- four players maximum to spend a relaxed evening. 

It is a story telling game where everything can actually happen. The aim is not to be the winner but to live the adventure. It was one of the rare cases that solo playing did not look odd to me. I have to say I enjoyed every minute playing it.

RATING: 6
Funny tales get told. The story book is well done and entertaining. But any time I played it it was fiddly to search the tables for a match and to manage all those counters which - in most of the cases - do not make a big difference anyway. It feels sometimes a bit to much like Talisman where you roll dice forever but never really do significant decisions. This game could be much better with a modern and tighter re-design. Just my personal opinion. I am pretty sure that others have different priorities in gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pretty pointless and incredibly random game, in which you hardly have any control on your character's (mis)fortunes. The gameplay (roll on a matrix to see what happens to you character) might have been tolerable in the distant past when Talisman and Dungeon Quest were hot, but it does not offer anything to the mordern player. I could really only recommend it to people who like to make up stories and spend the entire evening reading them to others. Which also describes how interactive this game gets.

RATING: 6
Tales of the Arabian Nights is really an experience more than a board game. In my case, an experience that I care to try once and likely enough to move on. There is no doubt this game is unique and the mechanisms are neat. The theme is incredibly strong and the gameplay is neat, though somewhat fiddly. That the game was designed in a previous age did not diminish the uniqueness of the game play.

The statuses according by the different cards really made the game shine. To be diseased, crippled and then getting a sex-change is priceless and hoots all around the table. However, because this is more an experience

Very popular in my family, so much so that the rest of them played without me once when I was unavailable.  That's unheard of.

I have no other game in my collection even close to what this game offers.  It is so unique.  That said, it is a game that is a bit of a pain to setup and plays a little slow.  The rules are also poorly written.  This may make it sound like a bad game, but I would buy it again in a second and I would never get rid of it because of how fun it is and how unique it is.

RATING: 7.5
This game occupies an odd place in my collection. It has a great theme, and generates enjoyable stories, but the convoluted play (so much to look up and cross-indexing of charts) is just high enough to make it hard to play with non-gamers, while the high level of luck and lack of strategic decisions or player interaction make it hard to sell serious gamers on it. Sure, *I* like it, but I wonder how many other people I can play it with.

This is a little out of our typical play patterns. We had fun, although it was tough to get into.  I imagine it would be great with the right people.  Reminiscent of those "Choose Your Own Adventure" books from way back when, this one has a lot of routes it could go which lends itself for some great replayability.  It is a long one, and it takes up some space.  So plan accordingly.

I just lowered my rating from 8 to 7.5.

This game has been great for getting friends who don't usually games to the table.

It just always seems to go on a bit too long — we usually reduce the number of points needed and don't fiddle with what kind they are — and the person who should win winds up in jail or with some other condition that prevents them from getting back to Baghdad.

That said, the storytelling works. The book is fun and funny, and with the right group of people, this makes for a great evening.

Not so much as a game as an experience...

Something seems different about this version perhaps I have grown older.  I suppose I miss all the different sub-games the original had, though rarely played them.  Course you can find those on Z-Man's site well most of them.

After a couple of plays it is still a most wonderful ride, and fills my heart with fun, always happy to play this one, though i think I need little breaks between playing it so I don't start memorizing stuff.

Highly recommended and a fun escape for two to three hours.

RATING: 7.5
My first game I was a respected outlaw that became crippled, envious, and insane. I lost and I had a great time playing.  Somehow all of these charts and matrixes come together to create a great narritive and though it sounds complicated the mechanics don't get in the way.  Some paragraphs may come up more than once, but there are so many and a lot of little variables change the outcome too.  So I think this game will have a great amount of replayability.  Its fun and it is well made.  Nice components and artwork.  If you dislike luck in your games I would not suggest it.  There is very little strategy in this game.  It is the sort of game that you play to enjoy the ride.  It creates fun stories and memorable situations.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Great game if you are in the mood. I think it's best with three players, otherwise there is too much down time doing nothing. Also you can't play the game expecting to win... there is so much randomness that it's impossible to do that, just ride along for the story and you'll be fine. Especially fun if you have people in your group who like to roll-play and read in accents :D

This is a wonderful storytelling game, and the decisions you make lead to different variations of the story that gets told about you and the adventures you encounter. Choose your actions carefully and the skills you possess will reward you become beloved, wealthy, mighty - even become sultan of a great land. Choose foolishly, however, and become a beggar, or be cursed with a beast's form or become insane from terror. But the game is way overpriced, and used copies tend to go for about $50 w/shipping on eBay, which is too much for me.

RATING: 3
"You are presented with a strange situation, however you lack the necessary skills, so nothing happens."

This is not a storytelling game, this is a game about being told a story. For a better experience with about the same quality, read a "choose-your-own-adventure" book. It'll take less time and make more sense.

After 2 more plays: At least it's not as incredibly boring with 6 as it is with 3. The stories basically feel like the actual Arabian Nights. That is, a series of unconnected short stories rather than a single story. No amount of role playing can turn this game into a single story.

Not so much a game as a story. You will make choices and decisions over and over again, but none of them will really matter in the slightest. It is a choose your own adventure book played with multiple people, each of you slowly telling a story and enjoying it immensely as you move along.

One of my favorites to play with my girlfriend.

RATING: 8
The pinnacle of narrative-driven boardgaming.  This is not so much a game as an experience, a story that is told using the medium of board game.  The vagaries of fate are everpresent, and the amount of strategy is effectively nil.  There is no such right choice to make at any point in the game, because they are all just as likely to screw you as to help you.  Nevertheless, this is a rollicking ride, true to its source material, and you have a great story when its over.

With too many players, the game is nearly unplayable.  The freshness of the game lags after a couple hours, and the game becomes very dull.  I cap it at five players, and suggest four.  The nature of the game means that I would love to play with a larger number of people, preferably with liberal application of alcohol, but it just gets too bogged down.  Swashbuckling, story-driven games should be able to handle large groups, dammit!

I really enjoy the storytelling aspect of the game and I don't mind the heavy luck component (it reminds me of the old "Chose Your Own Adventurers" books).

I'd prefer it if the game were more streamlined and less fiddly.

Although the way the storytelling unfolds is entertaining, there is not much of a game here. Its all a bit too random.
The way the storybook works is a bit convoluted and starts to be annoying halfway through a game, which drags on too much for its own good.
Yes, there is an epic tale unfolding in front of you, but the lack of an actual storyline keeps you from being engaged until the end.

RATING: 6
This is a giant multi-player choose-your-own adventure story. Despite the fact that you sit down for three hours, draw some cards and move things around on a giant board, you are not actually playing a game. There's no way to control what is happening to you or to position yourself for a win. Now that I think about it, even the victory conditions themselves are fairly random. Yet it's still a lot of fun.

The random things that happen to you are often quite funny. Especially once you are packing around some status and quest cards. I mean, what's funnier than the Prince of Thieves being transformed into a sex-changed donkey looking for love in the slave market? It's also hard not to be impressed with the sheer effort that went into writing the game's enormous adventure book. It's a pretty incredible piece of game design.

I don't always know what to do with Tales of the Arabian Nights. I never feel like I've gotten a satisfying "game" out of it, but I've never had a bad time playing either. I'll probably never get off the fence on it...so I guess it'll just have to hang around.

An enjoyable experience. This isn't really much of a "game" in the sense of most of the other highly ranked games here; there are more interesting decisions than I thought there would be, but overall, it seems to be the sort of thing where you sit back and enjoy the story. Choose your own adventure with a board seems like an apt description. But, it is a good time, and plays very quickly (my first 2 player game took an hour and a half including rules explanation), which means it doesn't wear out its welcome. My biggest concern going into this was that it would be like an inferior version of Once Upon A Time where the players have no freedom, but I was pleased to discover a totally different type of game. My initial impression is that it rewards sticking to your strengths (we'll see if that holds up over repeated plays, or if I was just lucky). I don't think it's something I'd want to play all the time, but this definitely has a place in large game collections.

Certainly this game is quite a bit different from anything I have played up to now. It's a story telling game which basically turns out as a light weight RPG/board game mix. The game stands to gain or loose based on the ability of the reader(s) of the tales. Heavily language dependent, if English is not your mother tongue or you don't have a certain mastery of it, don't buy this game.

RATING: 7
It's not really a game. It's a story-telling device. As such, it's pretty fun. The writing is solid, and the sheer spectacle is always entertaining. Unfortunately, the non-interactivity can lead to a lot of downtime, and some bad rolls can effectively lock a player out of doing anything for several turns, which really sucks. If you approach it as a game, you will not enjoy it. If you approach it as a silly story-telling game, you will probably get some kicks out of it.

RATING: 7
Fun idea, nice components overall, and nice as a non-competitive activity. But way too much downtime for 5+, maybe 4+.

The initial paras. (1-150 or so) should have been consolidated with the matrix lookup guide instead of in the main story book.

More conditional paragraphs and "random result" paragraphs would have been better, esp. with the more likely earlier encounters. This is just so obvious it's painful.

Fewer paragraphs but more relating to skill usage (so the same amount overall, just cut up differently) would have been better.  As is, skills often feel irrelevant, when in fact they should differentiate your story from everyone else's. Which leads to....

Why does Ali Baba = Aladdin = Sindbad = Scheherezade = Zumurrud = Ma'Aruf?  Given that quests are integrated so tightly, why not give them each a starting quest (or three) that determines a couple of starting skills, some backstory, etc.?  Feels too generic as is.

Very thematic totally extensive choose your own adventure.

I would rate this higher as its quite fun but it does have the issue where your the results are quite random as you can't really plan the effects of your choices at all. Still its good if you get people who will enjoy role playing their character and seeing what wacky adventures they get themselves into

This is not a strategic game, but I don't think that's a problem. Everybody who I have played this game with has loved it. This was the first game I played with a "storybook", which is an underused mechanic I really enjoy. It's like a very light roleplaying game without a gamemaster or tactical combat. It's not rated higher because really rewarding play sessions take a few hours, and there's not much of a climax: it just ends abruptly when a player reaches their score. Nonetheless, a great time.

You are the hero(ine) in a story of adventure and wonder! You will travel the land seeking your own destiny and fortune. Each turn the player has an encounter, and chooses what action to take, the outcome is read from the Book of Tales, that contains 3000+ stories. 
Choose your actions carefully and the skills you possess will reward you: become beloved, wealthy, mighty. Choose poorly, and become a beggar or a cursed beast! There is a winner, but the point of the game is more to enjoy the unfolding great story.

RATING: 5
I think this game would work very well as a 3-player only experience. While it accommodates more players, I think that only drags the game out and leaves folks sitting around waiting for their turns.

Not a game I actively want to play again unless with the right people and the right player-count.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Most of what you need to know about this game is that it has a thin manual, and a 1" thick book of story scenarios that the players respond to.

The game is very easy to learn and interact with, but more than that, if you have the slightest roleplaying bone in your body, it allows you to insert yourself into a character in Arabia.  

Choices are rarely this-or-that.  You have TONS of options, and you can pretty much always find one that fits the character that you are building.  

I've gone into a game deciding to be a righteous and helpful man, but when the game stripped me of my piety skill, it was natural that I should also change the character to become jaded and angry with the world!

This is the kind of game that creates stories that you will tell to other people later.
And it does that because it gives you incredible agency, while not giving you 100% control over your life.  

How many games can you play for 90-120 min (with three players) and think:
"wow, i want to play again"

There are a few things with the game that are in no way deal breakers, but could be better:
* There isn't a ton of interaction between the players and characters
* The game DRAGS if there are 4-6 players. Play it with 2-3 if you can. 
* You need to find out if the players are going to be ok with the harsh nature of the early game, and maybe soften it if all the bad things happening to them at once are going to make them frustrated, rather than just laughing.

This game is magical.

What a waste of time!  First off, it takes a LONG time to play, secondly the actions you choose have almost no bearing on the outcome of the game.  You can kind of figure out where you need to go, but there's a good chance you won't get there.  Choosing skills might as well be random, because it's going to be totally random whether they're useful or not.  Finally, if you play the game enough, the events get REALLY familiar, and it doesn't even take that many plays.  If you like storytelling games, just play an RPG, it'll be more fun and you might actually get to accomplish something (in the game, anyway).

Not really a game in the sense that you don't get that many meaningful choices to make, but a very entertaining roller coaster of storytelling.

Heavy-duty storytelling game. There are some fun moments as you pick a response to an encounter, but the actual "game' is quite random. The right players would probably love it (role-players, etc).

RATING: 1
This is not a game, it's a storytelling activity.  Strategy is not possible, as the outcome of any encounter cannot be predicted.  While the mechanics require that you make choices, you are not able to predict the outcome of any given choice in an encounter.

While everyone that I have played this game with loves the random occurrences of the stories that happen to your character, I find the storytelling lacking in that the stories have no cohesion.

This game is so wonderfully different from anything else in my collection. It really is more of a story-telling experience than a game.

I liked choose your own adventure/game book stories as a kid, and I find the story elements of this game quite novel and interesting.  Highlights of my first adventure:  TURN 1 - became the Vizier of Alexandria after killing the current Vizier when he tried to imprison me for eating figs out of a leather sack.  TURN 4 - Beat a dying old hag in the streets and only stopped when her hot daughter came to stop me... I proceeded to hit on the daughter and get shot down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
If you liked Choose Your Own Adventure books when you were a kid, you will probably enjoy this game. Though to be honest, it feels a bit more like an activity than a game... there's not a lot of gaming actually happening. But the giant tome that comes with this is amazing, and you can't help but appreciate the work the designers put into pulling this off. Loads of replayability as I think it would take forever and a day to hit on every possible scenario. 

I imagine this would be a good one to pull out for a book loving friend that isn't so much into board games but will appreciate being carried along by a good story. Extra good if they like to throw themselves into the character.

RATING: 8
An experience more than a game, this is one of my very favorites.  I absolutely LOVE playing Tales of the Arabian Nights!  A  huge bonus is that my daughter does also.

Winning or losing has no bearing on gameplay.  No strategy will help you because you're at the mercy of kings, paupers, wizards, witches, dozens of creatures and rolls of the dice.

Gameplay goes like this:

Roll--Move to a new location--Have an encounter with a person or creature--Decide how you are going to interact and/or respond to them--Cross your fingers in hopes that you aren't crippled or cursed in some way.

It is a laugh-fest whenever I play it.  The situations are unique, light-hearted, and always seem to ground my game goals into sand.

It does take a bit of time to set up and can take awhile to play, especially if you are playing with four or more players, but it can be worth it.

A great family game.  Opens up the imagination and guaranteed to bring many laughs to gaming night.  Perfect for holiday get-togethers.  :)

RATING: 6
As long as you're happy laughing at the misfortunes of others (like me), this game/social event is entertaining for an hour or so.  After that, I just want it to end.

I strongly recommend using the variant where players can only have three status cards at once, and that - once a player has three - the oldest card is retired once a new card is gained.

From my perspective, fantasy-minded families are really the best possible audience for this genre of game.  Unfortunately, in the case of Tales, some of the paragraph text and player actions - even if they're just silly fun for adults - are too dark for young kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is one of the most unique gaming experiences I have ever had.  It is a bit like multiplayer Choose Your Own Adventure set in the fabled world of the Arabian Nights.

Perhaps only a "game" in the loosest sense of the word.

It really is more of an experience. You can try your best to have a strategy but in the end either the book or some other player is going to screw you and the whole thing is going to fall apart. It's fantastic.

Bring a bottle of wine and a sense of humor and I guarantee a great evening.

My only gripe is the length, I recommend reducing the number of points needed to win to prevent it from going on for too many hours.

Awesome stories come out of this game despite the randomness of all the actions and choices. There does seem to be some "right" things to do in certain situations, but there's really no reason not to try wild and crazy things to get an awesome story. It'll be even more awesome if there's an app that automatically fills in the generic descriptors and handles all the encounters for you.

Choose your own adventure... kind of + Arabian Nights theme. It is a great experience. You get to essentially play an RPG but with minimal effort, much like the choose your own ending books of my youth. I love it. You can be a good or bad person and both will have good times and bad times. My only gripe is that even though the book of Tales is huge, we have run into the same stories quite a few times. I mean, I usually pick the option to "drink" if there is a house fire or storm because who wouldn't want to drink a storm? I always go to seven story and seven destiny points, gives the game a reasonable play time.

This is essential a competitive choose your own adventure game, but each player is working on their adventure separate from the other players, so there is very little interaction between the characters (although one character did pay to pass on her herpes and grief to another player).  The interaction lies in the heckling by the players.

I'd give it another go, but I was hoping for more of a story game, akin to 'Once upon a time.'  When the huge book came out, i knew I was wrong.  

This is certainly not a game to be taken very seriously, and is likely best played with plenty of beer, no, wine, on hand.  You can make what seem like great choices, but then the handsome barmaid mends you over a barrel and has her way with your backside, or you can try to what seems like suicide, but the merman respects your designs to push his people below the poverty line, and composes songs about you for the effort.

At first play, it was a crapshoot, but I wasn't bored for it.

This is probably the most relaxing game I have ever played.  Even if terrible things happen to your character, it is still loads of fun.  Winning is really not important at all, what is important are the stories you weave and the tales that are told.

This is not a game.  It is a multiplayer story.  Although the decisions that are available to you do affect the outcome of your encounters, they do so in an extremely erratic, unpredictable, and sometimes absurd way.  This might make for an interesting story (and I do recognize that is the point of the "game" which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1) but it makes for horrible gameplay.

If you like reading a "choose your own adventure" book out loud to a friend while he reads one to you, then you might enjoy this.  If you like tactics, strategy, meaningful decisions, player interaction, or balanced gameplay, then avoid this at all costs.

I was really disappointed with this one. I love theme and storytelling, but the storytelling of this game is just to separated from what happens on the board to make it interesting for me. I feel like I could just as well open a random fantasy novel on a random page and read a couple of lines from there. Making that into a completed story is just too far fetched.

RATING: 7
the closest to a RPG that you can get in a board game (and the only I had no need to say: let us better play RPG).

I play Z-Man edition and all is very well produced, box art is great and map also but the cards artwork is only ok.

almost no strategy and extra random, no much to play but still much to enjoy in stories 

the game is like a great fantasy ride and some situattions will make you laght

I rated game 9 but only if i play 2 players game, if more than there are enormous down times between turns when you have nothing to do and you can not follow 4,5 or 6 stories at once. with each player more I would give it a smaller rating. 

no much competition in game and no much care who will win in a game. not a game for those wgho can stand a lot of luck in a game.

my wife and friends love it. 
you will remember your game sessions of Tales of the Arabian night longer and with greater joy than many other games.

Edit: There are so many good things about this game, I wish I could give it a ten. Okay, so it's not really a game. The only problem with it is that it probably won't ever see any expansions (if you know otherwise, a geekmail would be appreciated) and the book of tales will probably grow old.

Don't get me wrong, it won't grow old for 50 to 100 plays, and it'll be a long time until I reach that point, so it's more than worth the money, but still, it's not your desert island kind of game.

The choices from the storybook text don't offer logical results, so the experience feels quite random. You might *think* skill X or Y will help in situation Z, but often it ends up being unpredictable what you really needed. The result is long, unsatisfying, and feels very random.

This is such a fun game!!!I was intrigued right from the start when I read about this,but after reading the comments here and being a competitive player I wasn't sure I would be able to enjoy this.I disagree with people saying there is no strategy to win this game,I find there is definitely a way to play this in order to win(of course,random things can change your luck for better or worse,but luck plays an important factor in almost all games).But to my surprise(and even though I still like to play to win ;)) I find the process of the game itself so fun that I often "catch" myself choosing the obvious wrong answer just to have more fun!!!A fun family game that does require a good knowledge of the english language though and can be a bit on the long side(start early ;)).

Not a game, an experience. Players are thrust into the world of The 1001 Nights and must roam through the world seeking adventure, riches and glory. Usually though, you end up falling foul of a mad wizard who turns you into a goat, or seducing a sexy foreign princess who turns into an evil fire demon and curses you into stealing everything all the time.

It's like if a choose-your-own-adventure had you turn to a random page every time, and occasionally would say "if you've been to page 33 already, read this instead."

I'm fine with the chaos of the gameplay itself, but the storytelling element is also chaotic, and getting an interesting story is just as likely as having nothing happen and ending up stuck in prison, getting the same story every time. It's propped up as a good example of emergent narrative in games but the lack of player agency means I don't care what is being read to me either.

I feel like there are things to be salvaged from this game that other games could borrow, but gosh I hate playing it.

I tried playing this a few times but everyone I played with never could grasp the concept so I traded it out.

How this gets the praise it does I'll never understand. An exercise in random, disjointed nothingness. I loved the idea, but the execution was far removed from what I imagined. None of your decisions made any difference, and story threads weren't linked at all. So glad I didn't shell out for it as I had planned to.

+ The thematic asymmetry is instantly captivating; Lots of cool cards with cool effects to look forward to playing.
- It seems that the City Watch is solely responsible for keeping balance in this game; If he lets one side go, that's the side that's going to win.

I've played some dogs lately, games I expected to love when I bought them and was horribly disappointed, but this one was even worse than Antimatter Matters.  The only reason I haven't rated it even lower is the length.

We all agreed that the Merchant's cards were of very little value, and that the Merchant's best tactic is to never play anything other than treasure cards to acquire more treasure.  The City Watch player had cards which mostly hurt the Thief, and some which hurt the Merchant.  The Thief has cards to hurt the Merchant and a few to hurt the the City Watch, and the Merchant has cards which fail to do anything to the other players and do very little to help the Merchant (when compared to the expense of paying for them).  So why even have them?  Good question.  The Merchant can rarely make good use of their cards, so their best bet is usually to just fish for treasure every turn and hope to get lucky.  This makes the Merchant player a very sad panda because it makes this ONE OF THE MOST BORING GAMES IN EXISTENCE for that player.

We had some other issues with the game, but after reading some reviews and comments from the designer, I can see where those issue COULD be mitigated with some conscious effort to do so by the City Watch and Thief - but (even taking that into account) why should they have to make a serious effort to avoid having the game feel broken?

So, in summation, a three player (only) game where one player might as well be played by an automatic game mechanic?  Where one of the players has no fun because they have no meaningful way to interact with other players beyond having to give up cards occasionally?  Where two of the players need either need to make a conscious effort to play a particular way or leave it up to dumb luck?

Either irretrievably broken or just plain worthless.  I'll let you make up your own mind.

And to think that I really wanted and expected to love this.  Now I'm really glad to have my money back.

An absolute treat of a game, taut 3-player asymmetrical card play in which each takes a faction in a fantasy city (city guards, merchants or thieves), and pursues a simple goal of either capturing a # of thieves, collecting enough gold or gaining infamy when your thieves aren't caught. The art is wonderful, the theme is really well integrated, and even though I've read a few quips over the balance of the various Hero cards, they simply add that much more flavor and just the right level of replay value to this. 

As of now this is my favorite Victory Points game, I would advise to sleeve the cards with thicker plastic since they are quite thin.

RATING: 7.14
I would definitely give this game another chance. I really wanted to like it since it is tough to find really good 3-player games. The unique player decks are a really interesting idea and the tension between teaming up to keep someone else from winning and trying to achieve your own objective is interesting. The huge problem with this game is that it seems far too luck dependent. Both games I played seemed to be completely decided by one of the three factions having such poor cards that they really couldn't keep up their part of the game tension. I will try it again and like that it is a quick game, but I don't think it will ever be better than just pleasant game that I don't mind playing once in a while.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: This fast-playing card game is made for exactly 3 players. Each player has their own unique deck, and individual objectives to win the game. When you play the game you can really feel the play balancing that must have gone on when designing the game. This game most resembles a 3 player Chaos in the Old World card game! I look forward to trying out all the factions to see which one is my favorite.

10 Plays: For some odd reason, I've only played the City Watch. I'm realizing that the City Watch have the difficult duty of keeping the balance between the other 2 factions. They control the tempo of the game. I'm still eager to try out the other factions.

20 Plays: I've now experienced all three factions. I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised at how balanced and asymmetrical each plays. 3 experienced players can have an incredibly tense time vying for the win without tipping the balance too much. This game is very much a knife fight in a phone booth.

RATING: 5
I want to like this game as a 3 player only asymmetric, however the Merchant just seems too easy to win and I've been told it was the same in other games. I'm not sure that even if the Thief and City Watch fully focus on the Merchant it would improve the enjoyment of the game. You want to have different paths to play.

I really like 3 player only games, they really scratch an itch for me. 3 Kingdoms Redux is in my Top 100 and Eggs of Ostrich is silly fun. So, I had high hopes for Trieste. Each player controls a different faction with a completely different deck as well as victory condition. The game really fell flat however. There really doesn't seem like there's much to do on your turn. If you're the Thieves (which I was), play a character and hope you don't get captured. The Merchant guild just draws money every turn until they get their winning condition. The City Watch tries to capture Thieves as quickly as possible. The whole thing was sort of boring, honestly. I will give this another chance with 2 different gamers and see how it goes. Maybe it is too light for the hardcore gamers that are in my group? If it disappoints again, off to the Trade or Auction pile.

i started to get the niche of it.
i quite like it now.but my friends hate it now also.

I'm increasing the number of lunchtime-friendly games that I can play with coworkers. Couple that with some positive reviews from those Dice Tower guys, and I decided to pick up this three-player-only game.

For those unaware, the game comes with three unique decks: city guard, merchant, and thief, and each deck has its own unique win condition. Game play is very smooth. Draw, then simultaneously choose a card and play it in turn order.

I'm really impressed by the different feel of each deck. And in fact, my desire to try the other decks almost certainly guarantees I'll play this one again. I won as the merchant, which is supposed to be the strongest deck for newbies, but we'll see if it balances out with familiarity.

Update: I'm playing this now with a lunch group off and on, and our small group certainly enjoys it. We played with the hero cards... not sure about those. Two runaway wins by the merchant. We agreed to go back to playing without heros due to balance concerns.

Update: well, I actually traded this game away. I like the concept quite a bit... it just wasn't clicking with my lunchtime group. We gave it 7 plays, but the proverbial light never went on for us regarding how to get more enjoyment out of the game.

The idea of a three player asymmetric game is wonderful, but the gameplay is clunky and the factions do not seem balanced.  There's also a great deal of luck involved -- you only see a small number of cards each game, so you'd better hope they're good ones.

I'd love to see this kind of asymmetry explored in more games.

The decisions seemed a little easy to me. I won 3 games in a row without thinking much about it with the thief and I don't really see what the other could have done about it given the cards they drew. Conversely, in the 4th game the merchant won with an equally easy time of it.

The production quality of the first edition is really very poor. The box is plain terrible. The manual has white borders. The cards graphics are not well centered at all. It looks like it's all been printed in a consumer-level printer, and assembled quite poorly by hand. My own print-n-play-s look better than that.

The good part is the art is pretty good. I'll gladly replace my copy if the game is ever re-printed professionally.

A very intriguing, simple 3 players only game. Love the asymmetry, the need to keep an eye on the other two players and work together to make sure no one gets ahead.
Take the time to look through the decks before the first game so you have a good idea what can happen. Prediction: the first two-three games will be won by the merchant as the nightwatch and the thief need to work together (or, the nightwatch needs to look away to make sure the merchant doesn't run away with the game).
Lots of subtlety in this game. Well worth trying and buying.

It was interesting and it worked for what it was. But as the Merchant, I had little to do other than haul in as much money as quickly as possible. So my game depended heavily on whether the Watch could stop the Thief from robbing me, with my actions having no influence at all.

So it works, it looks like a game, but I'm not certain it a game.

This landed with a dull thud the one time I played. The idea of an asymmetric 3p game is fascinating, but in practice that seemed to mean "each player's job is to make one other player miserable". I certainly don't feel like I understood it, but it also didn't pique my interest for more exploration.

A game designed for three players, who each have their own faction with its own set of game-winning goals. Unfortunately, how to achieve those goals is less intuitive for some factions than others. Of four games played among my friends and myself, the Merchant won every time.

The group I game the most with is 3 so I thought this would be a perfect game. It's plays very nicely and has some interesting mechanics that are transparent and clean. But then whenever someone wins it feels like there was no way to stop them. Every winner felt overpowered, which some say is a good thing (as long as it occurs for all 3 factions equally), but I don't think that's an acceptable qualifier compared to the turn to turn card play feeling confident about your actions.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game, 3 very asymmetrical decks that really play off of each other. The balance seems to come from the players knowing who to pick on. In particular the guard seems hardest as they have to strike a balance in how often to stop the thieves; too often and the merchant can safely make their money and too little and the thieves will collect all of their infamy and completely shut down the merchants. There do seem to be better and worse cards and so a rough deal can really throw off the game since the balance really depends on the players policing each other, but overall it's novel, fun, and fairly quick.

Rating after 3 plays.  Interesting 3 player filler with checks and balances between players.  Variable victory conditions and personalized decks between factions make this fun and different to play with each faction.  

UPDATE: Serious questions about this game now.  City Watch seems at a huge disadvantage and balance is off.  The whole point of this game is 3 player checks/balance.  Games seem like they could be quick wins for Merchants or Thieves depending on which cards come up.  Hopefully the secret characters will even things out a little.  Otherwise this game is a big disappointment and will be out of my collection.

Trieste, from designer Matthew Ma, is a boxed card game in which three players take on the roles of Thief, Merchant, or City Watch. Each role has its own unique deck and victory conditions. Turns are played out simultaneously, with each player selecting an action without knowing those chosen by opponents.

A 3-player only card game in which every turn you have to decide which of the other sonsabitches you're going to mess with. One is the city watch, and he tries to catch thieves and tax the merchant. One is the thief and he wants to screw with both the merchant and the city watch. And one is the merchant who just wants to be left alone to rake in cash. Your first game will go weirdly because you're not sure what all is going on in your deck, but after that it works well. Nasty, short, and brutish, it's a nice idea done well.

Only draw back is it's exclusively 3 players - and how often so you have just three players on a game night?

I really enjoy quirky games and this one is about as quirky as it gets.  The premise is simple.  There are 3 factions in a city and each faction messes with another faction.  The thieves steal from the bank, the city guard arrests the thieves, and the bank's winning condition is determined on the number of thieves in jail.  A great little synergy in this 3 player only game.  Quality of components leaves much to be desired but the game is fun and light.

If your average game group is three, this is a must have. Card quality lacks a bit and it could use an insert in the box to hold it all together. Regardless, it is an amazing game, especially if you like asymmetry. All the players play a completely different role in this, and yet it seems balanced. With my first few plays I thought the City Guard had no chance to win this game, but after learning the ins and the outs of the game, I realized that they were just the most difficult to play. If you know what you are doing, they have just as good a chance to win as the other factions.

After one play, I didn't enjoy this as much as I had hoped.  I like the fact that it is three-player only and that each player has their own unique goal.  The artwork is nice.  The cards did not appear to be cut very well and I was concerned that they would not survive a few plays so I sleeved them immediately (which is unusual for me).  In the end, I thought the act of simultaneously revealing a card was quite tedious when turns lasted only 30 seconds or so.

A really interesting card game. I'm actually kind of surprised that this came out from Victory Point Games, who are usually known for their war-ish games full of chits. This is the kind of game that a major company should try to release, as I think it would sell very well.

Obviously the draw (and drawback) is that you need 3p to play, but I love how each faction has their own victory condition. After having played a couple of times, I'm a little worried that the City Watch has a bit of an advantage, but time will tell with more plays.

Seems geared towards the merchant initially. I expect that things will even out after more plays and more experienced players. It's just a shame that it requires an extra level of understanding in order to make the play more even.

Games are so often designed as race games to the same victory condition - most VPs - that it's always refreshing to explore an adventurous design with asynchronous winning conditions. The rules are simple, the game play is fast, the balancing between the decks seems interesting, the artwork is nice. You don't see a lot of your deck - as I said, the games go fast - so the same deck can play quite differently from game to game, which to me creates interest even if you are more beholden to card-draw luck than you might wish. I have no idea how it holds up with repeat play, so the rating may vary in future, but after the initial thumbs-up games, this seems a nice addition to the 3 player filler market.

One of my personal favorite card games.  Three player games are exceeding rare (particularly ONLY three player games), but this one does it right.  It is asymmetrical, and people will always say one side has the advantage (usually the side they lose to the most), but I found it to be pretty well balanced.  And I'm not one of those creeps who only like a game if I win every time I play it.  I hate those guys.  

But, I digress.  This is a fun, fun game, and if you find yourself (as I sometimes do) in a three-way (heh heh) and you like fantasy card games, pick up Trieste.  I think you'll enjoy it.

The concept is interesting, it uses some novel mechanics, and it specifically fills the awkward 3-player group size. The factions are not balanced in any realistic way during your first game when nobody has a good idea of how to play. It gets better as you play 3 or 4 more games, but overall it still feels a little out of whack. Still fun, still worth playing if you have exactly 3 people looking for a game.

Fun game... I like the asymmetric decks and how everyone is trying to keep each other in check. 

However, there is a major issue with the game. It's very luck based. I'm not sure if it's the distribution of cards or what but as the city watch, it's your job to keep both the thieves and a little bit (the merchants) in check. Sometimes the merchants may have a card out that only you can counter... but if you don't have those cards you are SOL with no chance to change it (and then the merchants will win). You can only draw 2 cards a turn and some of the important cards only have 1 copy while some weaker cards have a million copies.

It's cool to have a game specifically made for three people, and with its short playtime and simple rules, it's easy to get to the table.  I don't feel as though it's particularly well-balanced, though.  Games feel fairly swingy, depending on what is drawn; it seems you can have an unstoppable win over the course of a few turns, if you happen to have a few great draws in a row.

A bit of a disappointment. Way too random for my taste. It seems like two good turns in a row can see you winning the game. Lots of random drawing of cards from other players which can mean nothing or really hurt them. Add a blind character action to each round and there's a layer of lack of control added to another layer of lack of control. So it all seems to come down to a couple of good draws in a row. I'd hoped for more.

The production quality is nice and I'm sad it didn't click with me more. I'd be happy to give it another few spins because it's short and easy to play, but I can't see myself getting past the constant random taking of cards from other players... I found it frustrating to be constantly taking one or two steps forward and then immediately always one or two steps back. You seem to just be waiting until someone takes pity on you and gives you a turn without being hit so you can make one turn of progress before getting whacked again.

I really like this game, but it's tough to find situations where you have exactly three players and want to play an asymmetrical filler game. It's not too difficult to understand, but new players might have a hard time remembering what exactly they are supposed to be doing.

I was told Trieste is "not a deck-building game," but I will say that it manages to feel like one even if it doesn't meet all the technical requirements.  Some of the cards are money you spend to get to play the other cards.  You get fresh cards each round and spend some.  But Trieste is strictly a three-handed game, and each player has a different goal.  Merchants need money.  Thieves try to steal the money.  Security tries to prevent the thefts.  Stuff happens:  Cards get played to hurt each others' interests.  A race develops to get to your goal number first.  The thieves need 9 successful capers to win, but Security need catch a mere 7 thieves to win.  Meanwhile the Merchants need, what was it, 11 more in money than Security has currently nabbed thieves.  On one play I can't say for sure that the roles are finely balanced, but they are at least roughly balanced.

Excellent three-player card game marred a bit by the imbalance of the Merchant faction. Their objective is far too easy to accomplish. My group has solved this somewhat by playing three sequential games, swapping off factions and keeping a meta-score: 1 point for every infamy, 1 for each prisoner, 5 for a merchant victory. Highest scorer after all three games wins. It works just fine, but I would have preferred the vanilla game to be balanced.

Pretty unique game and I like what they're trying to do.

My only issue is that you don't have any way of knowing which cards your opponents are going to play on a turn, so it ends up feeling really random. You effectively just play cards face-down and then one at a time players resolve their cards in a certain order, and a lot of card effects will make the other players discard their played card before it resolves. But you have no way of knowing whether you're making them discard an important card, or one that they were just throwing out there.

I still want to play some more to see if it starts to feel less random because the game has a number of things going for it: completely asymmetric gameplay (each player has their own goal), dead simple gameplay, and a quick playing time.

Rating could go up or down with more plays.

Props to the designer for having the guts to make a 3 player only game - I feel like that is such a hard niche to fill.  Cool game, the interaction is clear and present the entire time, although I felt bad being the City Watch constantly shutting down the thief.  Might have to play again now that we get how each role butts heads with the others.

Un juego más profundo de lo que parece. Asimétrico a 3, por lo que se tarda mucho en dominar los tres bandos. Eso si, es muy importante que todos sepan jugar, porque si no habrá un jugador que se escapará.

Intrigue and bluffing elegantly implemented in a three player game.  The artistic design is beautiful and gameplay is fast yet thought provoking.  The more I play the better it gets.  Trieste is as close as you can get to a 10 in a dedicated 3 player game.  The only flaw is the Heroes are not balanced.

Three player interactive card game. Merchant builds wealth while the city apprehends thieves who are robbing for infamy. Each with unique card decks, unique objectives and different special characters. A need/hate triangle of back and forth agreements and ganging up on each other grows out of strategic necessity. Commit your card to play face down and resolve rounds in turn order until a winner is determined. Unique and fun game play. Funny, that we seldom have exactly three people to play.

As a game with only one play it takes 7 for me but regarding that this is a card game and with so many strategy in i could rate it with 9 so the final result is 8

for 10-15 euros is money for value but not more

πρωτη παρτιδα σημερα πολυ επιννοητικο παιχνιδι που μαρεσε
το παιχνιδι εχει εναν κλεφτη εναν εμπορο και εναν αστυνομικο
ο καθε χαρακτηρας νικαει με διαφορετικο τροπο αλλα πρεπει να κοιτας να βαρας οσο μπορεις και τους 2(εξαρταται και απο τις καρτες)
Οσο πιο πολυ βαραει ο αστυνομικος τον κλεφτη τοσο πιο δυσκολο ειναι να νικησει ο εμπορος και οσο ο κλεφτης τα "παιρνει" απο τον εμπορο τοσο γινεται πιο επικινδυνος απο τον αστυνομικο(γιατι φτανει πιο γρηγορα στη νικη)
Το παιχνιδι μπορει να κρατησει απο 10 λεπτα εως και 40 (σε εμας γυρω στα 35 με εξηγηση) ο εμπορος εφτασε 3 φορες στο νημα να νικησει ο αστυνομικος 2 και ο κλεφτης ο οποιος πηρε και το παιχνιδι μια ενω ολα κρινονταν στην κινηση.

το παιχνιδι μου θυμισε καποια σχολια που εχω ακουσει για το Μαρια(το οποιο ομως δεν εχω παιξει ακομη) και θα ξαναπαιχτει συντομα

βαθμολογια 7-8 σιγουρα και βλεπουμε..

Gameplay is above average with substantial player interaction. Theme is also well-integrated. Artwork and card quality is good. While replayability is aided by being able to play three roles, the lack of card variation may mean the replayability is pretty low in the longer run.

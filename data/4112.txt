I have tremendous respect for what this game is, what this game has spawned, and what this game takes to play it well.  I just do not find it fun (maybe it's an innate prejudice against diamond shaped boards or some other ridiculous reason).  There are other connection games out there with a similar feel that are far more interesting to me (e.g. Mind Ninja, Gonnect, *Star) that I would much rather spend my time on.

Can an abstract get any drier? On an 11x11 board it seems that there is no room for error and within 2,3,4 moves you can be beat. It's a tight rope of a game, one slip and you're gone. 

I get the feeling you need to have a reasonable grasp of tactics before Hex becomes enjoyable. At the moment I admire it but it just feels so soulless.

14x14 Hex seems to give you a little breathing room but still probably only between evenly matched players. If not, 14x14 is just prolonging the inevitable.

I am a huge fan of the pure connection game genre, and Hex is the only such game I've played much of. Pure connection games have an amazing elegance that I've never seen matched anywhere else.

They are also deceptively deep. I'm good enough at Hex to understand that I could study it for many years and keep finding new insights. The largest board I've played on is 13x13, but I have a feeling that 19x19 Hex is to 11x11 Hex as 19x19 Go is to 9x9 Go, i.e. almost a different game with all the layers of strategy it adds. I believe that Hex and related pure connection games are around for the long haul, and that by the standards of a few hundred years from now, the current best players in the world are beginners.

I don't like the swap rule in games.  I respect this design but it's not something I clamor to play.  If there's nothing else going on on IG Game Center I'll sometimes jump into a game of this.

RATING: 9
An elegant game with tremendous depth.  The rules are nearly as simple as can be.  And I like the decisive win condition (no counting up scores).  

Not a perfect 10 because it needs the swap rule to balance it.  One other downside is that you can lose the game in, say, the third move without realizing it.  That can be frustrating for beginners.  But once you learn to prevent the early losses, the game starts to shine.  And to learn to avoid early losses, all you need to do is read and understand this link: http://www.mazeworks.com/hex7/hex_faq.html.

I've always been under the impression that I didn't enjoy connection games, but playing Hex has brought that into question.  Perhaps I simply couldn't grasp the fundamental concepts of the genre until I saw them boiled down to their essence.  With Hex, there's a great clarity, which was missing for me in games like Punct or Twixt.  

Regardless, my few games so far have been very fun and exciting, and I look forward to playing more.

From one rule springs endless delight. The simplest and purest of all abstracts. The most mathematical and one of the most difficult. Connect two sides of a hex board. Discovered by two different mathematicians, Hex is truly a universal game. Even a child could tell if the game was won. If extraterrestrial intelligence exists, they play this game. On larger boards, its depth will rival Go itself. Fascinating. Most computer programs are rubbish. A windows program "Hexy" presents a stiff challenge, but only on 11x11. This is the size at which computers will eventually overwhelm humans (if they haven't already). Luckily, moving up to a bigger board is always an option.

Hex is another abstract that's seen less play because of newer discoveries, but wow is it a beauty. These days I play almost exclusively pen-and-paper and it really shines as a core entry in my travel-set.

[2015.06.01]
As time passes I find myself appreciating elegant rulesets and there are fewer games more elegant than Hex.  For a time I thought that Havannah would subsume this game, but as it turns out the feeling of both are very different.  Hex is almost entirely unforgiving and subtle, whereas Havannah feels like a race with some slack built-in.

[2014.10.10] 8.75
Probably the most elegant game ever created.  There's just one rule (two if you include the Pi rule)... but it's a lifetime game despite this.  Amazing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finally, a chance to try one of the more significant games in abstract history- if only because it was one of the first known "connection" games- a concept that has been duplicated numerous times, oftentimes successfully. Hex is certainly a connection game at its most purest.  The 7X7 board is fine, but I can imagine this game being much more interesting with an 11X11 or 13X13 board. Its simplistic rule-set belies its depth. Why this game has completely died, while Connect Four gets to be the primary big-box toy store abstract of the last 40 years- I have no idea. There are expensive copies available through the larger independent abstract publishers, because this deserves a larger release again.

RATING: 9
I think I play at an intermediate level now, but I have lots to learn. It's hard to find a regular opponent, so I wrote a Facebook app to play on. 

http://apps.facebook.com/hexgame/

With more experience I still find the game to be exceedingly dry. In an abstract game like Chess or Go a move can still have character, e.g. be an aggressive attack or a nervous defence. In Hex a move is just a move,  and I don't see any passion in the play. 

The game is also unforgiving. On an 11x11 board a bad move can spell doom. In many other games there's time to fight back, but in Hex you can put yourself into a losing position and spend a long time doomed without realising it. I will continue playing but the game is not showing me the hidden beauty I had hoped for.

There's a downloadable AI opponent called Hexy which plays a very good game. In fact it's too good - I can't beat it on even the easiest level so I find it very very boring and unhelpful.

Hex (and its cousins Y and Unlur) is a beautifully simple game -- the rules are no more complex than tic-tac-toe -- with tantalizingly deep gameplay, especially on larger boards (say 11x11 on up). Easily learned and played by youngsters too. It might seem dry to most gamers, but for abstract lovers it doesn't get much better. See Unlur, Havannah, Twixt, or even Punct for games with a similar connection theme, but which are a little higher on the fun factor.

A simple and straightforward abstract game, maybe I am missing something by looking at other comments but I don't see the kind of depth here like in Go or Punct and Punct is a much more interesting connection game with many more possibilities, it truly appears Burm took Hex and built on it, a lot on it.  

It also seems in a 'Mancala' kind of way that the first player has way too much advantage but apparently there is a "pie" rule to get around this. Maybe someday I will play again and be enlightened but its not on my "want to play again list". 

Edit - 4 => 5 Well I played it again many years later, a pile of times actually and even downloaded "Hexy" which is quite feisty. While it shares many similarities to GO, it definitely does not share it's depth, not even close, there is more there than meets the "EYE" though (Go punn intended). I also find it very dry, and would much rather play Punct for connection but this could do in a pinch (it actually reminds me of a bigger version of tic-tac-toe)

If the ratio of strategic depth to rule complexity is the measure of a game, then hex may be the best game ever created.

Games are typically short and sweet (or bitter), and it's impossible for players to draw.  You don't need to worry about cycles like in chess or go.

I see some users complaining that the game is shallow and the first player has an easy win.  If this were the case there wouldn't be a Hex Research Group at University of Alberta :)  Just make sure you play on a board of at least 11x11, and start with the swap/pie rule.

Enjoyable abstract that appears more threatening than it is, mainly because of its resemblance to Go, at least components wise.  Otherwise, it's a standard connection game, though (I understand it to be) a classic one.  When it comes to connection games, I think I prefer Twixt or Pünct though.

Simple can be not just good but great.

This is possibly the world's simplest game, easier to learn even than Go, but with a similar range of arcane patterns and strategies that it may take dozens of plays to see.

It's not that much of a surprise John Nash co-invented it; there's some demanding decisions trees going on.

A game that is trivial to learn, but offers deep tactics and strategy. I even did a phd thesis based on the mathematical properties of this game!

I like the tactics, but it is an odd game in that early opening play is vital, and a game can be over very suddenly (sudden-death property). For that reason, I personally enjoy it less than other abstract strategy games (e.g. Go and Blokus Duo). Still, definitely worth trying out.

After hundreds of plays. One of the few games I consider to be works of art. BGG users collectively give it rating of 6.75, implying that many BGG users belong to a different species than me. 

People are given to muttering in awe at the elegance of Go, but Hex makes G looks like a kludgy mcklugeathon. I mention this not because I dislike Go (on the contrary I think it's one of the best games on Earth), but rather to emphasize just how elegant Hex is. 

I love it even when being crushed by much better players.  Every move is huge and resonates for the rest of the game. Accusations of dryness are admissions of ignorance; this is a profoundly wet game by any standard (there's a reason it's been likened to a "knife-fight in a phone booth".  Imagine how wet that would be).  Plus, loveable mathematical properties.  This is one of a very few post-apocolyptic games: After we've nuked ourselves silly, our cities have been reclaimed by wilderness, BGG and the internet as a whole are faint memories, our descendants will crouch on rocks and play this.    

If there's a problem, it's that first-time players can fail to see what the game is about if they aren't shown basic tactics first.  Hex is a victim of its own perfection in that everything about it seems so dead simple that new players often assume that there's nothing to it, and dismiss it. Too bad, because alot of people who don't normally like abstract games would like Hex if they were introduced properly. Like all the folks who like Blokus. I bet if the company that produces Blokus made a nice version of hex with colored acrylic pieces and that cool embossed board, and marketed it as Crazy Hex Blokus or something, it would sell.

Hex es el exponente más conocido de los juegos de conexión y evidentemente es un buen juego. Aunque recomiendo jugarlo en un tablero 14x14 de primeras. El tablero 11x11 se queda corto enseguida y solo sirve para aprender, me da la sensación de que este tamaño es como el tablero 9x9 para el Go. Sirve para aprender los conceptos del juego pero no alcanza la suficiente profundidad.

RATING: 5
Interesting game, but extremely punishing (and absurdly in favour of the starting player once you know what you're doing). On my first game I looked for a minute at the opponent's response to my first move... and conceded. It's that brutal. Too bad, its ruleset is ultra-ultra-slim.

To the Amish, hex-signs are active engagements -- both defense and offense for the tetched head. *Heinash* they call it. (At least that's what it's called in my comment zone thus.)

RATING: 9
It's biased towards the first player (the smaller the board, the bigger the edge) but otherwise Hex is a deserved classic. It's the sleekest connection game there can be, one of the very few games whose elegance can be remotely compared to Go's, and one of the other few that are even more minimalistic.

Based on one play: Connect the two sides. Plays like Go, but with a different goal, which takes away all the greatness of Go. I guess two avid players would have more fun, but for two beginners, kind of dull.

Good abstract, if a little small.  This is a great one to start out your abstract life with, but it can be "solved" relatively easily, making it no longer replayable.  Reminds many of a simple Go.

I know this is supposed to be a deep game, and I don't doubt that, but I don't find it that much fun to play. I've felt this way about a few other connection abstracts; I don't think it's a genre I'm that drawn to.

Elegant.  It's nice to know that if all you do is prevent your opponent from winning, you will automatically win!  I've only played on small boards but can imagine how nice a game it becomes when you play on a big board.  However, I still prefer Go, partly because there's more opponents available, and partly because Go offers a more interesting variety of puzzles (though this could just be because I haven't played enough with Hex).

I think I'm going to have to make the game and try it out. It seems simple and deep, but maybe not as interesting as some of the other games I'm considering.

However, given how easy the game is to make and that it's out of print, I won't be buying it.

For some reason I think that Twixt works better.  I think it is because of how you are constrained in your placement in Twixt and how you must plan ahead to even create a block.

That said Hex came first and in its own way works well in its elegant simplicity.  Regardless of how well it still holds up as a game, it is hard for me to get overly exited about these kinds of abstract games.  It is good, but just not good enough for me to actively want to play it.  That said I'd rather play this than rummy.

Classic connection game played on hexes. I think it's been proved by "soft" analysis that the first player wins, which does not really kill the game for humans. Th proof alone is worthy of study as that concept relates to many abstracts.

This game fascinates me because everything about it appears to be obvious and straightforward. Of course it isn't, and as players begin to fill up the board they realize that this game is both a race and a game of blocking. Victory is always just barely out of reach, which provides all of the tension necessary to make a game one of my favorites. I typically play with pencils on print-and-play boards.

Print and play board. Stones from [thing=11997] [/thing].

Excellent connection game! One of the purest and simplest abstract games from a rules perspective. Just connect your two sides of the board by playing one stone at a time in the cells of the hex grid, and you win. However, deep and feels like a "knife fight in a phone booth" (or "in a wardrobe" now cell phones make phone booths go extinct).

RATING: 10
This game fits the "seconds to learn, years to master" description to the maximum level.  This game has so so much depth despite being so quick, and I still am finding new strats to use over 7 years after first learning it.  Every gamer should try this game out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A deep connection game with trivial rules. It's interesting to explore the space of blocking strategies and arrangements that can lead to a win, but for the time invested, you could also explore the smaller space of two or three similar games with more constraints.

Wonderfully easy to learn, and the strategy quickly becomes intuitive. I'd pick this over Go any day (provided it's on a 19x19).

Edit: Like Tic-Tac-Toe, the magic ebbs away once the strategy comes to the fore. Very easy to become a moot point a few moves in (at least on the 11x11 board). I'd really like to try this on a larger board.

It is not generally known, but "A Beautiful Mind" John Nash independently invented this game. after as shown in the movie, he saw Go as flawed. The time and thought that went into inventing "Hex" was taken out of the original cut but it can be seen in the Director's scenes in the Special features section.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Simple concepts translating into simple rules. Better than Go in that respect, and as deep as an abstract should be.

With the rules being so simple, it comes as surprising that noone thought of this before. Maybe that is the reason why the story line of Piet Hein inventing and John Nash reinventing  shortly after is rarely challenged. It is, however, unlikely in itself, and it is likely that Nash got word from Denmark. Denmark was, after all, on the leading edge of mathematics and physics for quite some time. The idea that Nash transferred the concepts of Go to hexagons makes it even more questionable (actually, to a square grid plus one set of diagonals connecting in one direction only). Why should he have done that?

This game has lots of things I like; courtesy of the rubber band effect, it stays close till the end (but I understand why it's annoying to make any inroads before the end only to have them erased and with experienced players, it's just a jockeying for positional bounce). It has area influence/control elements in terms of route building and pricing of the locations. The nuance of the auction in terms of both bidding and nominating is fantastic. It's a game that rewards those who understand how to ride (and abuse) the turn order system, and can do long budgeting (much more so than other auction/econ games). I generally enjoy playing it, but I just don't get jazzed about the game; I don't request it, and I admit, I'll sort of think of whether I want to dedicate that sort of time to it if asked. It's a game where if someone said "you have 4 hours, would you rather play 1 game of Indonesia or 2 of Power Grid" I'd say Indonesia hands down, but if I only have 90-120 minutes, then I'd consider Power Grid. It fits in that smaller time frame.

One thing specifically about the deluxe edition, I find the map is less gritty, but overall I'm happy with the edition compared to the original.

This is probably the eurogame I've liked more so far (but the sample of euros I've played more than once is quite small).
There's a good amount of interaction thanks to the auctions and the competition for cities on the map and resources from the market.
On the other hand, the market isn't particularly interesting, and the calculations required by the connection of the cities are a tad boring.

Enjoyable game, highlights are the auction and very tight resource management.  Gets a little math-y at times, but it's enjoyable to play even when not doing well.

It's still Power Grid.  The new cards and minor rule changes are interesting.  However, I find the new art busy and I like the old wooden houses and resource tokens better.  I really don't know if it's worth buying for existing PG owners.  Even for new PG players, I'd probably just recommend the standard version for $20 less.

LIKE: The maps and power plant values are different. New natural gas. Refill cards are nice addition.
DISLIKE: The new board is visually busier. The plastic money is too slippery. Hard to visually block off two sections of the board.

OVERALL: I wonder if the money became discs to provide more open information. They need cups to be better contained. Gameplay-wise, Europe map seems a tad more expensive, making a slightly tighter game. Still great (I would take -1 point off for the slippery money chips).

RATING: 7
This basically still the same experience as the original Power Grid. You can call me a conservative, but I find the original one visually more pleasing. By this I mean that all essential information is easier to read which makes the gameplay smoother. However, for the art and components, the deluxe version is more interesting. So in reality it is just a matter of personal preference. One offers more eye candy while the other is more functional.

One really disappointing feature is the money. In the original you had Monopoly style paper money that was hard to handle. But at least it was easy to read the worth of each note. With the deluxe version you get slippery plastic coins that, being monocolour, are hard to read and still hard to handle. So really no improvement there.

Anyways, the game is essentially the same providing the same kind of experience. Not really worse or better than the original.

I've played Power Grid a few times before and it's always been a 6. This deluxe version clears up a few of the issues I had with the original (stagnant power plants and not having a player aid for refilling the markets). The catch-up mechanism is heavy handed, but because it's consistent, managing your place in turn order becomes a huge part of the game, which makes it less irritating. I got used to the design of this one, and I am starting to like the more vibrant, colorful design better.

Power Grid is one of my favorite games. Economic games are one of my favorite type of games and Power Grid usually is one of the gateways to this universe. I recently sold my copy of the base game to buy this deluxe edition, my friends have the base game with a lot of expansions and now we can play both versions and all the expansions.

I liked this version the same way I liked the base game, the huge maps are cool and the little differences from Europe to North America turn then into new expansions to the base game that the Germany and USA maps are the same thing in rules.

This 2 new maps doesn't change the rules so much like some other expansions, so it make a very solid game to teach and play.

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Bigger board (which includes spaces for energy plant cards)
- Trash is replaced with natural gas
- Card art makes it easier to see energy type
- Improved 2-player rules
- Art is brighter
- Resources are shaped like the resource they represent
- Markers on the board show the beginning of Step 2 and the end of the game
- There is a card that goes on the board for # of resources that come out, no more hidden book information (ex: there is a card for a phase 1-3 grid for resources in a 2 player card)

NEGATIVES:
- Paper money replaced with hard to read plastic coins
- Not compatible with expansion maps (unless you buy 2 conversion kits)

It was a 10 the first few times I played it, but since then I have seen some flaws with every play and that is why I have lowered the rating to 9 (sometimes I even feel is an 8) and the 2 flaws that bothers me are:

 - the rules - there is not a single game that I always forget something, like to take the lowest card at the beginning of step 2, to take the right amount of cards for different player counts, that the first player is only first for the bidding, etc. this is actually my game were i commit the most rule mistakes, maybe only once i have played a perfect game and this bothers me alot!

 - Is so mathematic that sometimes i feel that all you do is add and substract all the time!

Apart from that, the game is great for what it is and it does it well. Im always willing to play

Power Grid Deluxe is much better than the regular that I played AFTER. I find that this is a game that is more easily taught by watching. This game is fun, but I didn't know the cards involved in the game. Once you know which cards are available, you know which ones to buy and which ones to bid on. I enjoy it, but it does take quite a bit of time to play.

It's a bit odd posting a separate comment for the [thing=2651]same game[/thing].  Thus, I will focus on what is unique to this version.

First of all, there is a map of North America including Canada and Mexico!  I know the original game had a U.S. map on one side.  The map here is larger, and has more cities including "double cities" for New York and Mexico City (players may place two generators in each).  The connection costs have changed slightly.  There is more open space on the map, which I like; the first game's map feels claustrophobic in comparison.  The coloring is much more subdued, with the oceans being light beige.  The coloring of the new power plant cards is also more subdued, and I like it.

The "resourceeples" in this version are custom wooden shapes that make sense: coal looks like lumps of coal, natural gas (the replacement for "garbage") looks like a blue flame, oil looks like an oil drop, and nuclear fuel is a cool-looking, red radioactive trefoil.  The coins are serviceable plastic ones that will withstand many playings.  They are a definite improvement over the paper money from the original.

What really holds up though is the theme.  It just [i]works[/i], even ten years later.  It is so well integrated that I can't deconstruct [i]Power Grid[/i] into discrete mechanics; I feel like I just managed a power company and enjoyed every minute of it.  These new components help me to get immersed.

I am withholding one point for the rules.  Specifically, the interaction between the power plant market and the "steps" in the game is fiddly.  When the game is cruising it is seamless, but then there are these jarring moments when I have to remember what to do when advancing to the next step.  It is easy to forget things, and I don't like game results with asterisks due to misplayed rules.

[i]Power Grid[/i] is still an incredible game, and this version is a wonderful tribute that enhances my enjoyment of the original in almost every way.

(2-6 Players, 120 min, CLASSIC) The bestselling game about running an energy company. The rules are simple: invest in emerging power plant technologies at auction (both fossil fuels and renewable alternatives), buy fuel resources on the open market, then pay for infrastructure to extend your coverage to as many cities as possible, earning more revenues with each connection. The key is doing so better than your competitors. Contains dozens of country maps and optional variations.

Power Grid is an amazing game, one of my favorites, but I see little need for this version.  None of the changes are an improvement; several seem to be an unfortunate step backwards. I can't speak to the strength of the power plants, as I haven't properly studied them.  Although some of the bits are perhaps very slightly nicer than the original, components are simply a bonus on an existing game; the original components were already excellent.

This feels like a money grab rather than a "deluxe" edition, as things are really not quite "deluxe" enough relative to the original.  This is like buying the Blu-Ray version of Star Wars' "retouched" versions, when you already have the "original" versions on DVD, and could stream them online whenever you want.

If you already like Power Grid, then this game might give you some neat, new stuff to enjoy.  But, there is nothing here that really changes how the game works.  It's still pretty much the same old thing with natural gas instead of trash, some new maps, better components (including more usable stuff on the map and little pieces).

Changes up the early-game of the original -- the initial randomness introduced into the plant market eliminates scripted first-turn plays, and the power plant deck is a bit more balanced, making cheap-capacity fueled runaways less likely.

Does nothing to fix what I consider to be the late-game pacing flaw of Power Grid, however.

Overall just a tad better than the original, with a particular nod to the surprisingly good "Against the Trust" 2p rules, but not sufficiently different from the base game to warrant owning both.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
A "deluxe" update to PG which makes a few small tweaks, most notably in the distribution on the fuel track and in smoothing out the power plant deck (so there are no longer any lower numbered plants which can power lots of cities).

Still a great game but I slightly prefer the rough edges.

RATING: 9
The most compelling feature of the game is the resource market. It makes you consider your opponents infrastructure in relation to your own. The game starts at a slow pace and quickly ramps up to a nail biter of a finish.

The only fault for this game is that there are a lot of transactions with the bank. That and calculating connection costs may be a lot of math for some players.

Not a fan of this version. While the box art of the original edition is boring, the cartoony, childish version in this edition doesn't sit well with me. Some of the minor changes annoy me--the plastic money is awful. While paper money gets a bad wrap, it sure was better than this dreadful plastic crud. Gameplay is mostly the same as the original, and so I enjoyed my play of this, but I sure don't need this version, and will enjoy the original very much, thank you.

I had some buyers remorse almost immediately after I bought this; I just don't play Power Grid that much, and while I like it, it's not the all-time classic for me that it is for others. But after finally having had a chance to play it, the new edition is really nice. The upgraded components are all pleasing, if not up to the standards of the deluxe Puerto Rico. The chips work way better than the cash. The maps are more interesting. The power plant deck is *far* more balanced than the original was (the expansion deck was a big improvement). The new couple of rules tweaks - the larger plant market, the discount marker - solve significant problems with the original.

Anyway, I was very pleased with the set and am glad to own in. Power Grid will never be a game I play a ton, but it's a good game a lot of people like and I'm happy to own the nice edition.

I really enjoy Power Grid, but thought this "Deluxe" version was a bit odd.

First off, it's not really all that deluxe.  The wooden pieces are just different, and even at that, some of the choices of shape were odd.  The city pieces in particular are weird, as none of us knew what they were supposed to be shaped like.

Secondly, the way the graphics were done makes the map harder to read than the original game, which is unfortunate.

The main improvement here are the cheat cards you place on the board for refilling the markets.  This was the only real thing we thought was an improvement; I'll just print up a set of them for my regular Power Grid and sell this version off.

Overall, a Deluxe version of Power Grid was a great idea; this just failed at that idea in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A solid auction game that everyone should own.

However not a 10 because the game economy runs in a large scale--transactions are in double or triple digits.  Modern games,  money is tight but in this game money flows freely and that leads to lots of double digit calculations that players have to do in their head.  Not an elegant design.

Great game. Lots of strategy. Its a complex Euro game that keeps everyone involved throughout the game. It doesn’t take long for people to realize the impressive strategy mechanics as the game progresses. Players who pay attention and have good foresight will win. Players like me never win this game. The only downside is that, unlike Catan, the best players will win probably every time. Weaker players may never win. Alas... 

Pros:
	• Good two-person game and only gets better with more people. 
	• Many layers of strategy
	• Good element of tension
	• Everyone is involved - no downtime in between plays
	• The resource mechanics are impressive. 
Cons: 
	○ The quality of the game pieces are poor. 
	○ I purchased the rather pricey anniversary addition. It significantly improves the game quality. The $$ pieces are still lame. 
	○ The quality of the deluxe version is about what you should expect from the original.

At first I was disappointed when I heard about Power Grid Deluxe.  I like the original Power Grid, and own all of the stuff for it.  I saw this as a second edition.  It is not really.  It is still the same Power Grid with some subtle changes that I really like.  Garbage has been replaced, and the natural gas resource seems more viable than garbage ever was in my experience.  I like the new power plant deck too.  I've only played North America, and the rule that has the cheapest power plant having a minimum cost of 1 really helps things along.  At no point did I feel the game stall, drag, or plateau.

A new edition of Power Grid, featuring a double sided Europe / North America map.  Slightly tweaked rules, but nothing startling, a new deck of power plants, different markets (no garbage!) makes for a different, more fluid feeling game to play.  But ... not a lot has changed, the base mechanics are still the same, and it's just a little bit cheeky calling this a "Deluxe" edition.  I'm not sure a graphical makeover and some shaped wooden bits make this "Deluxe".

(Up from 7.5 base game)
It's not really much different from regular PowerGrid, but it is nice to have a deluxe edition that comes with 2 new maps and a new power plant deck, in addition to upgraded components.  Unfortunately, I don't know if you can really use the new deck with the old maps, since the resources have been completely changed.  There's nothing stopping you from using the new power stations and money if you want.  It's not like the original had crappy components, though.  The only real difference is the sculpts; both are made of painted/stained wood.  And I'm not really a fan of the artwork in this edition.
So, yeah..  More is always good, but less-compatible 'more' isn't as much.  Cool components are nice, but they aren't that much cooler.  I wasn't in any rush to get ahold of this one, but it's nice to have.

The upgraded components are nice; having replenishment rates on cards is handy as well.  Game is pretty much the same, although the initial setup is a bit different (initial plants are drawn randomly from a larger pool of cards and there's a permanent "only costs one" discount).

It's still Power Grid so it is a great game.  Some of the minor tweaks to the rules are nice, but I would hardly call this "deluxe".  I had the option of upgrading my old copy or trading for this. I chose poorly.

Rated as an expansion, as it only has minor differences from the original Power Grid. If cost is an issue, I could not possibly recommend this as it's very similar to the original. However, if it's your first game in the series, I would probably give it an edge over the original. Unfortunately, this version isn't compatible with the expansions, so unless you don't mind fudging it (I think it could be made to work with some compromises), you might want to stick with the original.

PG is a game I bought without having played it simply because it is so revered. I would like to have access to this game in the future but I'm not sure whether I need it in my collection or not. May trade for something higher up my wish list. 

PROS
-New board art and resources are great. The board is huuuge too!
-PG is pure player interaction from the auction to the resource market to the city connections. 

NEUTRALS
-Like Colosseum, PG has an interesting mix of quiet moments and loud moments. The quiet moments basically come from having to work out the math, which is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. 

CONS
-While the board art is great the box art blows! More of the cartoonification of board games...
-PG has a lot of little rules that are easy to miss or misunderstand. I feel like this would be one you'd have to study up on if any length of time between plays.
-Likewise, it's quite fiddly. Bottom-deck this card, check the steps, move the discount marker, rearrange the market, etc. The game upkeep detracts from the game play. This is especially true of the plant market. If these rules were simplified, I would have enjoyed that more. 
-Is there a rich-get-richer problem? Possibly but this just means the other players need to be more adept at stopping this from happening.
-On a related note, there will be games when one player is clearly going to win and you can just stop before the final round. The ability to math out the realities make the endgame anticlimactic.

There isn't a large difference between this and the original. The components are good (except for the chips), the balance on connections and plants seems improved, and the tweak on the starting bid for the lowest power plant (North America side) seems to help speed up the game a bit and changes game play a little. Right now I would say the original edges out this edition with the additional maps, but they are both solid. For someone deciding between the two base games, this version seems to be the way to go if not planning to buy expansion maps.

Huh. Well, that's different. The changes in the market pricing are really interesting, but of course I can't do the math to figure out if this is more balanced.  I do like the $1 token; it makes a lot of plants worthwhile when otherwise someone might be forced into not buying a plant. (1 play)

Just a bit better than Power Grid thanks to all the new niceties like a card for each player number providing the number of resources to add, two placeholders on the order track to help remember who bought a plant this turn and resources that are more evocative than the original.

In addition, the two-player rules are simple and provide more strategic choices than you would think at first glance.

This is like variant map to me with a few interesting rule tweaks. 

First off, though, the rule book is SO MUCH BETTER than basic PG. This is what the rule book should have always been.

As for the tweaks, I ended up liking the value 1 bid option on the North American map. I wasn't sure at first, but it really does make those lower number choices that sometimes hang around too long go away. 

The card deck seems well balanced. 

The resources, especially uranium, are cheaper in general. Or at least not as dynamic as in base PG. I suspect this is because connection costs were pretty high, which left less money available for market manipulation. I kind of like the market play in basic PG a little better.

The board tweaks are all pretty good (the two columns for turn order is great, the gavel, having space for the power plant market), however, I don't like the graphic design as much. I liked having the replenishment reference on a card. 

I have not played Europe, but the North American side is an excellent variant map and rule set!

[disclosure] Play tested on pre-production version.  

It's Power Grid with bigger maps, both physically and an extra region, thus more variability.  Auctions are slightly different depending on which map you are on.  Garbage has gone and natural gas is in.  Power plant deck is now split into smalls and large and the deck build is takes this into account.

The map now takes into account little usability things that some players have already been doing, sliding the piece across when you have had your turn (i.e. finished with the auction phase, bought resources, built connections), markers for end of step 2 and step 3.  Yes, they are little things, but they really do improve the game flow.  Also the power plant market fits on the board.

I have seen photos of the new bits which look great.

With Power Grid I usually recommend the 2 player game as a teaching game, or add the Robots.

With Power Grid deluxe, The Trust makes 2 player an excellent cut throat game.  Highly recommended.

I rate this just as high or higher as Power Grid - since Power Grid is one of my top 5 games evar, that means it rates quite high ;-)

02-02-2015 - Much like the original with some small differences.  I think the biggest difference, and possibly a rule I just happened to miss all these years in the original?, is that the lowest-value power plant starts at $1 each round.  The differences are really mostly aesthetic though.  The only thing I really DON'T like is that there is no longer a round summary card for each player.  But whatever, other than that the components are all great - and no more rolling oil barrels!  I'll give it an 8 since it's one of my favorites, though we usually do pull something else to play.

Changes from normal game:

Components: The new resource pieces are much more thematic than the nondescript cubes, cylinders, and octagonal prisms of the old set. The plastic chips money is less thematic cause it doesn't have the artwork of the paper money but should last longer (though still poor quality because the chips don't stack, and it is hard to read the numbers). I don't like the artwork for the board as much, but the artwork of the power plants are much better.

Power Plant Deck: The deck seems to be balanced a bit better (not that old Power Grid's deck had that much imbalanced, it just seems that the power plants that used to be always bid up are weaker, and some of the weaker plants stronger), and I really like the added variety of possibly being able to switch off between the two plants.

Rules: Starting power plants have slightly variable setup, which adds I decent amount more replayability. New minimum bid of 1 on the lowest numbered plant prevents it from sitting there for most of the game. Two player variant rules are decent, and while I still think 2 players is the worst number to play Power Grid, it has turned the 2 player experience from utterly unlike normal Power Grid to be enjoyable (the dummy player simulates different resource buying and blocking off players on the board, but still fails to capture the auction aspect).

Restock rates and some minor rules are different for both sides of the map, just like an expansion, unlike the original base game.

The maps feel like variants. Because of that, and the unimpressive Europe side, this is an 8.

New Art Direction: I can take or leave the minimalist approach. I'm not sure why the radical shift.

New Wood: The resources are great but the dynamos make me have to explain what they are to every new player. They should have just been factory shapes.

I like the variant with the 1; it really shakes the later game up. The extra space for Europe? Waste of time. Perhaps it shortens the game by a round?

I love Power Grid, so when I saw that this was coming out, I had to get it, even though I was unsure how different it would be. The new maps (North America and Europe as opposed to USA and Germany) are bigger, with 7 segments in each (as opposed to 6), which means that there's naturally more variety from game to game. The change from Trash to Natural Gas plants is purely cosmetic, however, the new Power Plant deck definitely feels different. A big improvement is the greater variety of starting plants, with a random combination each game as opposed to the static cards in the original game; the result is that there are no more standard opening strategies.

The two included maps differ in play by more than just geography, as the game now includes a couple of special rules for each map. The America board does away with automatically removing the lowest value power plant from the market each round, and instead, each round there is the option to bid $1 on the cheapest plant in the market. The effect is that players need to buy more plants in order to get to the big plants in Step 3; you can't just wait it out. The Europe map has an extra space in the future market, which reduces the chances of big plants coming into play early.

In terms of components, the plastic coins are an improvement over paper money, as they are more durable. The inclusion of an auction hammer, markers to show when Step 2 and Game end occur and cards with resource market refill all benefit the game, as do the inclusion on the board of a space for the power plant market and a track to show who has purchased power plants. The art style is different, and more comical / less industrial. I can't say I prefer one style over the other.

1st there is nothing deluxe about this version. The bits are no better than the original and whoever thinks that shitty plastic coins are better than paper money needs a swift kick in the groin. The coins in this thing blow.

apart from that its as good as any other expansion to Power Grid.

A really interesting shift of the amazing Power Grid.  The plastic money tokens, which at first I wasn't entirely sure about, have been a blessing.  I love the resources, the board designs and the artwork.

That being said, its still Power Grid so only get this if you want a somewhat fancier version than the original.

Power Grid is a really interesting, really well-designed game. There's nothing else in my collection quite like it. It's very structured (with strict phase and "step" rules). I like the structure because it's not overwhelming and it allows you to get in a groove quickly. On the other hand, games that are heavily process-based, make it much more difficult to memorize the rules. 

I've played Power Grid twice now. The first game was fun, but we apparently had a bad shuffle, which through off the end game, or at least made it sort of an anomaly. The second time I played Power Grid, I played it with 2. This second time was playing the "deluxe" version. I like the deluxe version better, no question. The cards are better (art), the board is better (bigger with both USA and Europe), the resource bits are better, and despite the haters, the coins are WAY BETTER than paper money. They are still not better, but will hold up over time. Besides the components, the 2-player game was quite good, considering this is largely an auction game. The "trust" dummy player tightens up the gameplay quite a bit, and requires minimal housekeeping. However, one thing that literally broke the game for us was the 7 city cards (46 and 50). There are only two 7 cards, which makes it complete luck of the draw who get one. I understand that this game is not pure information, but when you are playing for 2 hours, you and your opponent are tied with ability to power cities, and all of a sudden, a 7 card comes out, and only 1 player has the ability to acquire it, it completely throws the game out of balance. Before that point, my wife and I were 1 round from ending the game, we could both power 15 power plants, and it was going to come down to money (the tiebreaker for game end). BUT, as last in turn order, she was able to win the only 7 card that came out, and could easily win the game, since she could power 1 more plant than I could. I had way more money, we had been neck-and-neck in power plant cards, and out of nowhere, a 7 card completely changes out fortunes. That should never happen in this game, because it makes it way too random for what it is. I think a simple fix is to remove the 7 cards at the beginning of the game (so not a deal-breaker), but it is something to keep in mind. 

Overall, I love power grid. It feels so elegant, fun and interesting to play. A staple of any collection, in my opinion.

I coughed up for Puerto Rico Deluxe I didn't feel like I had a choice.  I haven't reconciled with this one yet.  I love the board with the space for the power plants.  The change in the resources is certainly more in line with the actual market (or so it would appear).  Not a fan of the tiddlewink chips for money but other than that its OK.  I don't think it will take the place of my normal maps tho. Played it a couple more times recently. I'm warming up to it as just another PG alternative

I've never enjoyed a game i suck at so much more than power grid. Seriously, I suck. I've only won this game once. The game has transcended into a classic.  feel as if this is the king of economic games. It scales great for 3-6 players, components are top notch in all versions, and there are so many expansions you could almost never play the same game twice. Love this game, just wish I'd win more.

This is one of my favorite games and is a definite must own for any gamer in their collection. The rules by itself are simple enough to teach but mastering the complexities of the multiple markets and concocting a winning strategy turn to turn is a challenge to satisfy any gamer. I'd say this is a good Third Step game for those new to the hobby. With the multiple economies to keep track of and the heavy amounts of math very new gamers might be scared off.

A modern classic. The only thing keeping this game from ranking higher is how similar each game can feel, and how artificially restrictive it can be.

One of the most "mathy" games I own. But it does stand well amongst my friends. Has a particular style of game that can seem back-stabby with the locations of the power plants, but it's all about winning in the end.

Length can be an issue if AP is involved however can be mitigated by setting a time limit if it becomes very bad.

A classic, and would love to try on different maps.

This is a fantastic strategic Euro game, with extremely good replayability. The rules are actually pretty simple and the complexity lies in the heavy strategy involved with the resources you have and how clever you manage them. I love the fact that you need to make sure to balance all of them to win rather than just over spending or trying to acquire everything.

From what I've seen of the review, its not worth trading in my current PG for the cost of this, and the picture/graphic design for the board and such is questionable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Compared to the original, its pretty similar. About equal in graphic design though I may enjoy the cartoonness more in this one.

The plants are better in this one and speeds up the game more.

The hammer 1 elektro rule stops bottlenecks and speeds up the game by maybe a round imo.

There is no turn or round summary which is a big minus for teaching beginners. Maybe print out one from BGG.

The restock cards for players is clever and good. As is markers for step 2 and 3.

The board is a bit wasteful spacewise and could be a bit smaller and I wish it were. The original board was a much better size imo.

Resources are better but I dislike the color of the coal, the red and the green as they can be similar for color lind people. But the original game isnt better necessarily as its also colorblind unfriendly. Generators and resource shapes are better as they dont roll though and more thematic than houses.

I prefer hidden money but do prefer coins to paper. Shouldve had screens imo. But coins > grubby money.

Usa is better balanced here though idk about tje colors. Its fine I guess and brighter than originally. Personal taste I guess. The less than 10 color and >= 10 color difference was a great add.

6p was still same, tense and fun. I suspect 3-5p scale the same.

I rate Power Grid much higher (9) but as I cannot recommend a new player to get this version then I rate this version low.  This version is incompatible with all other expansions for this game (except Robot).  There was so much potential here and I think it fell flat.

The Bad: 

- Incompatible power plant deck.

- Color scheme. It isn't too bad but too pastel for my tastes.

- Lack of reference chart on the back of the rule book.  *EVERY* other version has this!

- Lack of turn order and order of play chart for each player.

The Good (in no particular order):

- Reference card for restock

- color coded plants

- large wooden pieces for materials

- Natural gas over garbage

- bigger map with extra area. Though now I have a 3rd box to store a single game. Guess this could go in the things not to like side of the ledger.

- new mechanism ($1 bid).

- The pieces for hammer and the lines for 2nd phase and end game. And the double order track.  Most players had some mechanism for these but it is nice to see on the board.  

- Plastic coins instead of money.  Been using poker chips for this game for a while.  Nice to see this built into the game.

One of my game clubs favorites, so I picked this one up on discount since I don't own a copy. I agree with Tom Vasal who said it is not really a "deluxe" version of the game. If you already own a copy, there is no need to get this version.

However, I do prefer the components of this version over the original version (except for the money which isn't much of an upgrade with the plastic chips). The larger board is nice and feels more expansive than the original board and I actually prefer the cards over the original.

Played last night, and I like the changes.  These are mostly cosmetic changes with one significant rule difference, so it doesn't really qualify as "deluxe" in the strictest sense of the word.

This game is essentially Power Grid, with a slightly different aesthetic and slightly tweaked rules.  The most significant rules change is that the bidding for the lowest plant in a turn always starts at $1, and if no one wants it at that price, it's removed from the game.  I liked this rule quite a bit--it really makes the idea of "temporary plants" more palatable, and really speeds up the flow of the game.  In that way, it feels a little like the Benelux expansion.  I do with this game were meant to be compatible with the myriad expansions that already exist.

I really, really like Power Grid, have bought almost every expansion and given them to my friend who owns the base game, along with replacement acrylic resource counters.
So I thought Deluxe would be a good opportunity to own my own copy.
The problem is that none of the "deluxeness" improves the game - the board is too big, the power plant future market for Europe is in the wrong place, the power plant cards aren't as nice, neither are the board graphics.
Also, I'm not sure about the Europe map in play - that wouldn't be a problem if this was just an expansion map but all I have seemed to gain is my own copy to play with a second group that doesn't play Power Grid very much.
Update, after more plays, both Europe and USA are ok maps and my only real complaint now is that the plastic coins feel small and cheap.
Still better than the "brass" and "silver" coloured discs in a Martin Wallace game!

RATING: 7
Normally this would score an 8, as the base game also scores an 8 with me. Still only a 7 because of the 'deluxe'. In fact there is nothing deluxe about this edition. Only the resources have nice components. But the houses from the original are more beautiful then the things (don't even know what it should represent) they replaced them with and the plastic coins are just really cheap instead of deluxe. Deluxe would be wooden money like in the limited edition of Automobile and a sort of screen to keep your money hidden.

I like the look of this version. The plastic money chips look cheaper in photographs than they actually feel in-game. They have little impressions on them of the denominations, which is nice. I like that game handles 6 players, but it's odd that no matter if you have 5 or 6, you still close off two portions of the board when you play. Odd because, I've never seen a game close off any portions of the board when you are playing with the max players. I guess it adds some replayability? The game has three phases, but Phase 2 can sometimes never happen or only last 1 turn, which seems odd. The last two turns can be very slow as players calculate their moves out.

Overall the game is huge, heavy, and pretty dry. The auction mechanic is a nice touch, and the interactions are very unaggressive, the game itself a fairly old member of the German-board game world. I can see how this is a towering idol of the BGG community and the Euro-games to boot, but boy... it's a bit much in places for what little it is.

I think it's perfectly well designed, but sorta drab. But it is what it is I suppose.

Treat it as an expansion, rather tan a reimplementation. The new commodity pieces are nice but that much different. 
It has new maps, some rules tweaks but nothing revolutionary. 

Natural Gas (the storm commodities (at least that is what the symbol looks to me) replaced oil and oil took over the spot held by garbage previously. Interestingly the combined plants are these 2 rather than the coal/oil as before.

Once the tedious rules (concerning phase changes and bureaucracy) are well understood, this game is great. The map is huge and really gives you room to place your things. The rule about the first player being the one that's closest to victory BUT he is last to buy resources and only has access to the smallest plants (first to pick) evens things so it's often a tight match of calculations and bets.

It's Power Grid.  Is it different enough to justify a separate purchase?  No, not if you have the original.  But certainly recommended as a gift to someone who doesn't have the game at all.  Certainly has different (neither better nor worse) graphics and the "improved" user information more useful for more casual gamers but redundant for experienced Power Grid players.

The mix of power plants felt different, but the game had the same overall feel as traditional power grid of how to balance money and actions.  The difference is most likely due to unfamiliarity with the new plants.

Power grid is a classic for a reason. It looks so complicated, and people can make it really competitive if they choose, but it isn't bad once you've played a few times and power grid is also designed to punish those (to some degree) who choose to be super competitive since hoarding resources comes at a price. Very enjoyable but not necessarily one I would bring to the table with non-gamers (at least not at first).

I put off playing Power Grid for a long time, but off by the theme and reputation for mathiness. I was wrong to do so. Yes, it's bit mathy, but not overwhelmingly so. It's still an approachable and highly enjoyable game as long as you're not playing with human calculators who want to math out everything.

Bottom line: I enjoy this one and it's unique enough to stay in the collection.

Played twice. I have never played the original Power Grid before, so I do not aim to compare both editions. What I do know is that this is a solid design – the rules are not too complicated, but they produce a number of subtleties. I like how the concept of obsolescence of less efficient plants is crucial to the game.

The thing is, Power Grid demands players to continually calculate and recalculate to victory. They may be fairly straightforward addition problems, but doing so over the course of over 2 hours isn't quite I'm looking for in a game experience. I would certainly be more enthusiastic if it can be completed in two thirds of its playing time.

I avoided this one for a long time, mainly because I'm not a fan of auctions. While they are important, picking the right plants is more important because you need to match up their output with the number of cities you have connected. It's a much more interesting game than I thought, and it really helped that I played with a group of non-AP-prone people!

Much like the Ticket to Ride 10th anniversary edition, this deluxe version of Power Grid was great for me because I've never bought or even really played any of the expansion maps.  So those maps/rules not working with the updated components here don't really bother me.  I don't even mind getting rid of all the expansion cards I had with the base game (they aren't compatible with the new version unless you get sleeves with opaque backs - good luck at this odd card size).  Even though some of them were fine or even good, Power Grid is a tight economic/auction game that I really like just playing with the out-of-box rules.

The new version is almost entirely just aesthetic upgrades.  New, better looking, resource tokens and factory markers plus a beautiful board (not sure if it is bigger or not)and plastic chips instead of paper money.  I will say that while plastic chips is better than paper money they feel kind of cheap.  If you are going to give a game deluxe treatment they should have gone with metal or some otherwise sturdy manufacture for the new money but that's really the only complaint I have with the components.

There are a few small non-aesthetic changes with the new version.  There are some clarification, ease-of-use, and balancing tweaks to the rules.  The garbage resource has been replaced with natural gas and the previous US and Germany maps now show all of North America and Europe.  I don't know if either of those changes translate to any actual differences in the plants or power lines in the game though.

This is one of the less expensive "deluxe" versions of a game and for my needs it fits but I'm sure if you have any of the expansion maps or promo cards and want to continue using them this is one you can skip without missing out on much.

Note to self: Hmmm. Don't like the new art on cards/maps.
Power Plant Cards: Ugly. I much prefer the old cards.
Map colors: Incompatible and garish.
Money: Not stackable, and I prefer poker chips anyway.
Player Aids: Not as good and I have resource cards anyway.

Rule Changes:
1. Varied starting plants rather than the 3-10 plants: I like the original.
2. The lowest plant starts at 1 auction rule: We should try this.
3. On board spaces for market and bidding/buying/building: We do this.
4. Marker bars for transition to step 2 and cities required to end the game: Sounds useful.
5. Huge maps: Never was a problem.
6. The Trust: I don't play two player.

tl;dr: Power Grid with [-]better[/-] different artwork

So what was wrong with the original Power Grid? Nothing. Why did they redo the artwork? So they could sell you the same game again at a higher price.
"But it has nicer bits!" Does it? They're different, they look more custom. But does that make them nicer? I don't think so.
Anyway, the game itself is very good of course. There are some minor variations on the base game (we played the Europe map) but it's basically Power Grid with gas in stead of garbage. I can't fault the game for not changing a winning formula, I just wish they didn't try to sell me the game again.
The new map is nice and worked great with 5, is all I can really say about this.

Initial rating: the same as Power Grid!

Seems to make some much-needed improvements to Power Grid (markers for when step 2 and the final round are triggered, references for how resources are restocked, the $1 token to keep the power plant market moving, etc). Will have to play a full game with it to see how the new power plants and all of the new elements work in practice, but this seems like it could be the definitive Power Grid.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4+[/b]
The game needs more players because of the auctions and the buildings. Without competition for those, the tight economy changes for the worse. I wouldn't play it with fewer than four, and five seems to be the sweet spot.

Auction game where players bid for increasingly powerful powerplants for their placed generators on a very cramped map. Players need to bid for the nice powerplants, buy resources to fuel them, and build generators trying to block eachother.  Euro style point game with emphasis on cost-effectiveness and blocking. Simple rules but big strategy/tactics.

I like the art and the new components and some of the rule tweaks for creating the power plant deck and reducing the price of the "unwanted" power plant.

Kind of unfortunate that there seems to be no appetite to create more maps that directly integrate with the deluxe version.

But with the 1000s of games out there I don't think I'd play enough Power Grid to grow bored of the 2 included maps.

One play of this (and one play of the original Power Grid years ago). The auction element always gets me careful, when you don't know what to bid or how the price is created and what you do actually get. Of course when the game is familiar the element of auction doesn't irritate me that much.

The game itself seems quite okay, but I don't see anything that special in it. Might get better with more plays, when you actually have some idea and plan. I can play this again, but I have no need.

I'm not sure whether to consider this edition as just an expansion or as Power Grid 2.0. Gameplay is almost completely unchanged, the primary differences being a completely new Power Plant deck and natural gas has replaced trash as an energy source. There is one alteration to the base rules in how the initial row of power plants are distributed, as they are now randomized. No longer is the first auction programmed and punishing, which is a great change.

Otherwise, it's just Power Grid. I don't think it's a great purchase if you are already invested in the original, but if you aren't...it's a great place to start!

Well I guess there's enough new board and bits in the box to warrant its own entry but it's still just power grid at heart. Get it if you're burned out on the old material, otherwise you can probably find an original version for cheaper and still get the same amount of fun out of it.

I've played Power Grid before, but the Deluxe version adds some very nice pieces, an updated and much clearer map, and some rules tweaks. It's those rules tweaks that got me to purchase Deluxe because it promised to play faster, and I can report that it [b]definitely does[/b]. (Three of us managed to play a game in roughly 90 minutes and could probably speed it  even further.) It's the game you know and love: auctioning, a market, and area control. By now you probably know if you like it or not.

Lots of difficult money management in this game; you will need to bid in power station auctions, buy fuel from a shifting resource market, and expand your generator network across the map. I found the rulebook to be a bit bewildering initially, but it all snaps into place quite easily after a few playthroughs.  The Deluxe version looks nicer than the original but is not compatible with the map expansions.

There's general dissatisfaction with the new coins, and calling it 'deluxe' is outrageous.  But I'm happy with my deeply discounted Black Friday purchase.

Would I have paid MSRP or the standard online price?  No, I don't think so - but only because I'm already heavily invested in the brand.  It could be worth it to new players who purchase this version as their only copy.

It's all good to me, since Power Grid will always be a favorite.  The 'deluxe' variant will certainly get played and enjoyed, though likely not more than any other PG expansion.

This is my initial rating.  I need to get more plays in to judge how good this game really is.  After one play, I can tell that it is a game that is really well crafted down to the last dollar on connection costs and balance.  I do think that there are points in the game where a player can AP due to some math calculations.  This is the first game that I have ever played where it just seemed easier to get a calculator out do do some of the double digit math.  The math is simple enough, but you feel like you are doing it often enough that you don't want to have to make that extra mental effort at some point in the game.  That said, I like games with calculations and math so I enjoyed the economic budgeting and choices that the game presents.  One thing that I REALLY enjoy is this game more than any other game I've ever played is just how precious turn order is.  There are times where you won't play optimally in a particular phase of the game just so you can make sure that you are in a better turn order position for auctions, buying resources, and placing generators in the following round.  Being the first to do these phases can be critical and save you a lot of money.  It is a tight balancing act and I love it.  I also enjoy the race to get your generators out onto prime spots on the map.  Overall, I just really enjoyed this game and can't wait to play it again.

Haven't played this version enough to say whether or not it is better/more balanced than the original. I do love the coins as money, and the variables on cards (how many resources each round are replenished based on character count). I also enjoy the graphic design/illustration more on this one, that alone will make it hit the table more than the original.

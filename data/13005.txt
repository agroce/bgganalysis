RATING: 6
Don't know if I like it or not yet.  It was friendly, but as I feel that Zooloretto is watered-down Coloretto, this may be watered-down 6 Nimmt!.  (Weird that adding a board and more rules can make something watered down...)

Traded away.

RATING: 5
(1 play • 7 players) Hard to really know how I feel not only after only one play, but also because said play was with SEVEN!  Meaning it was just as chaotic as the card game.  With that much craziness, I'd MUCH rather play the card game, where, believe it or not, I feel I'd have more control.  Also, I think the card game with 7 would have more fun to it, as playing with cards just feel lighter than playing with a board.  Some neat ideas here, though, and I'm definitely eager to try this again with fewer players... so that's a good sign.

Sokkal változatosabb, mint a Vigyázz6, mégsem adok rá több pontot, mert nekem a kártya változatnak épp az egyszerűsége tetszik, és az, hogy ott fixen tudom, hány körből áll a játék, itt viszont nagyon esetleges, hogy mikor van vége.

Túlságosan kiszámíthatatlan tud lenni a pontszerzés, gyakran randomhoz közelít... Ez erősen csökkenti az élvezeti értéket szerintem. Az pozitívum, hogy nem csak gémerekkel tudom játszani, de a (kártyaváltozathoz képest) nagy változatosságnak nagy ára van: majdnem ki nevet a végén szintű szerencsefaktora van a játéknak.

RATING: 7
The board game has more things going on than its card game brother, 6 Nimmt.  My family (composed of four players) prefers this to the card game because there's more to think about.  These extra things get in the way when there are many players, however, and makes it too chaotic.  For six or more, you'll want it as simple as possible, so go with the card game.  For fewer players, give the board game a try.

RATING: 9
Renkívül mókás játék, melyben sok a szerencse, de ebből adódóan adja vicces hangulatát. Rövid játék, melyet sokan lehet játszani gyors szabálymagyarázattal.
Nagyon jó, hogy itt a tervezést a másik fél akaratlnaul is fel tudja borítani.
Ez egy hangulat emelő játék, mely nem az agytekervények túborzolásáért jött létre. Mindenképpen ajánlott darab. Sajnos nem lehet kapni, vagy ha igen, akkor azért annyit nem ér mivel feltornázták többszörösére az árát.

RATING: 6
The big brother of 6 nimmt!. It's fun to play, but 6 nimmt! plays faster and can be played with with more people, and the the special spaces in this game don't add much.

The only time I played, several people were tied with 0 negative points in the end, as a result of the positive scoring rounds. It might have been coincidence but the chance for this to happen seems rather high.

12/12/06 - this one is an immediate hit with non-bggers! It triggers a "let's play that again" response with folks who don't evaluate the snot out of a game. It's easily explained in about a minute and is fun to play. After a few games of this, I prefer it over 6 Nimmt and will probably suggest playing this over 6 Nimmt.

RATING: 5
This may play better with lower numbers of players, but with 6 its a waste of time. Very chaotic, very little control over what happens. Finally, the 'negative scoring' is out of control.

I didn't care that much for the original card game, but I far prefer it to this boardgame implementation. And that's curious since the theme and the presence of poop spots on the board should play in its favor (for me). 

Overall, I don't really care to play this one again, but I'd be willing to play it with youngsters.  At least its fairly short.

It has more rules, but it's sufficiently more chaotic that I think I'll stick with 6 nimmt. In fact, I would probably like this board version more if it retained the 6 nimmt rule where underplaying all active rows means taking a row, or in the case of this version, taking the row penalty value.

[1 play] Basically didn't care for this. It's essentially a dolled-up boardgame version of 6 Nimmt!, and I didn't feel the extras added anything that I valued.  Also, I'm sick to death of bathroom humor in game themes.  I'm sure it would be hilarious if I were a 7-year-old boy, but I really don't get why so many adults still enjoy this sort of thing.

Jópofa "licitálós" party-játék. Nem kell túl nagy taktikát vagy stratégiát várni tőle, de ez talán már ránézésre is látszik. A folyamatosan változó szabályok teszik teljesen kiszámíthatatlanná, ugyanakkor szórakoztatóvá.

RATING: 5
Tanz der Hornochsen is the board version of Category 5. It keeps the same basic rules but adds special event spaces and a few other rules. When given the choice I'll go with the card game any day since the added complexity tends to not add much to the game.

RATING: 7
Cute board implementation of Take 6/6 Nimmt that was actually a lot of fun to play. (That's what I wrote after my first couple of plays... subsequent playing has found that I was dead on right - and that you actually have more control than in Take 6, even with 7-8 players. Highly recommended.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is fairly chaotic but that chaos is not created by the game itself but by other players' moves. You can try to predict them but in the end luck plays a significant role. I don't mind that in games and I like this one.

The only thing I don't know is whether I will be playing this game in some time from now. It offers to little new in comparison to the original card version of '6 nimmt!'.

Give it a try - a good shot for certain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun game that converts the card game to a tile placement/board game with a few additional rule changes that imho makes it more enjoyable than the card game.

RATING: 7
Wacky theme in a game where you have to watch where you step.  Very entertaining to play and has some fun artwork.  If you like 6 Nimmt, you will probably like this as well.  It has a different feel than 6 Nimmt, and adds some nice variety.  The more players, the more chaotic.  I don't think the game works well with two players.  This game happily went over went over with non-gamer types and I was certainly enjoying myself, despite the fact that I ended the game by landing in the poop.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice party game whit a funny concept where players run towards a big heap of cowdung so best is not to run too hard and avoid diving into it.
Good game for starting off an evening of gameplay with a larger group of people.

A 6 nimmt on board? lovely game, IMO is better with less players than the "father". A bit chaotic, though you can have some things into account. Overall fun, much fun
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So far, I like this just a little bit better than 6 nimmt.  Tanz der Hornochsen has a more varied texture, more character, and presents more elements to consider.  It's also more chaotic, has a higher rules overhead, and doesn't play as quickly.  I'm glad I own both (and Hornochsen, which I also like).  I would probably lean toward Tanz der Hornochsen for smaller groups of players, and the simpler 6 nimmt for larger groups (or when time is short).  The chaos of TdH is just a bit too much with more than 5 or 6 players.  6 nimmt is also too chaotic for my tastes with groups that large, but it works better because it doesn’t tempt you to overthink things like TdH does.  That’s precisely the same quality that causes me to prefer TdH over 6 nimmt for smaller groups: it gives you more to think about, and more opportunities to play with skill.

Good stuff.  A bit of randomness, and light strategy revolving around guessing the moves of other players and timing things just right.  It takes a while to pick it up, but once you do, it moves quickly and makes sense.  As a bonus, it supports a wide variety of numbers of players.  This is one of those games that could be made or broken by the people playing, so I'm rating based on an ideal set of people.

A weird variant on that old standby 6 Nimmt. Not bad, but I'm not sure I like the additions all that much... Rounds where you take positive instead of negative points, rounds where you play your cards face up instead of face down... it's interesting, but for me the strangeness interferes with the simple purity of the original.

Really a cool translation of 6 Nimmt into a board game. I love the theme, dancing around the cow pies. Played with as many as 6 but I think it works better with fewer. But it is fun to try and keep out of the dung heap even with 6.

Nice boardgame version of an excellent card game (6 Nimmt or Slide 5). It doesn't quite convince me of it's justification as a boardgame (like Zooloretto convinces me). It kind of feels like a fun card game variant with extra scoring nuances. It's debatable if you need to own both. But the game is definitely fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun boardgame variant of the 6Nimmt! cardgame. I'm not sure if the increased different possibilities to be screwed and get negative points and chances to get positive points even increase the random factor or add a strategic element. Definitely one for the family or big groups of up to 8 players which gamers can enjoy as well as a light distraction.

Based on 2 plays.  Ugh.  The game is, of course, mostly a luck-driven activity.  Unfortunately, the one smidgen of strategy seems to require that you look at all the number on the rows to devise the best play.  I would not advise this strategy - it increases your chance of winning by a trifling amount and earns you the enmity of all at the time as you drag out this already over-long game.

Terrible. It was too long, the reverse zone (i.e. deduct penalty points instead of adding them) makes players feel that the game never ends. Basically the core challenge to the player is same as Take 6. And I played really well in this game since I deployed the same techniques as playing Take 6, like double guessing. I love Take 6 as I rate it 8/10 or 9/10 but I'd give this trash 2/10 or 3/10.

RATING: 4
A boardgame (barely) version of "6 nimmt!" It's fun and it's got some good twists above and beyond the basic gameplay, which closely resembles 6 nimmt!, but in the end, I'm not sure it adds that much. What does seem possible is that this may do better with fewer players while the original prefers more like 5 or 6 players. The tiles are a bit annoying compared to cards and the whole aspect of everyone having the option to buy cards before each turn really messes up the pacing. Fun, but I may mostly stick to 6 nimmt!, and I'm usually a big fan of novelty.4

RATING: 8
A játék kis lapkákkal folyik, amik 1-99 között tartalmazzák az összes számot. A táblán 4 véletlenszerű lapkával elindítunk 4 sort, majd a játékosok ezeket folytatják: titokban kiválasztanak egy-egy lapkát, amiket aztán ahhoz a sorhoz kell illeszteni, ahol az ott lévő legutolsó lapkánál a letenni kívánt nagyobb értékű, és a legkisebb köztük a különbség. Persze a sorok nem végtelen hosszúságúak: akinek a lapkája kiszorul egy sorból, az megkapja az ott járó büntetőpontot.
Nagyon nagy buli :). Tipikusan az a játék, amit nem szabad komolyan venni, mert bármennyire is akarod - főleg sok játékosnál -, úgysem tudod előre megtervezni a helyes lépést, vagyis kiválasztani azt a lapkát, amivel nem szerzel mínusz pontot.
Erre bizonyíték, hogy egy 5 fős játékunkban a játék kb. háromnegyedénél én álltam legrosszabbul, jóval "leelőzve" a többieket, a végén pedig én nyertem, vagy 10 pont "hátránnyal".

This game is another one I think is woefully overlooked. Dancing cows, a little fun with numbers, and trying to avoid the cow poo! This game seems to be the opposite in strategy to Slide 5 or Category 5 or 6 Nimmt! The strategy seems to be more clean-cut in this game which may make it more enjoyable to play! The game end is the best, when the player in the lead (which is not good) must take the final slide into the enormous pile of....

6 Nimmt is all gussied up here to look shiny and new, with variants thrown in, but the game experience is still ... 6 Nimmt. And that ain't too big a recommendation, especially for the increased cost of a boardgame.

As chaotic as 6 Nimmt!, but would probably rather play the latter.  Cute components.  Traded.

I'll stick with 6 Nimmt! and Category 5.

Something different from most games. This one requires you to be the person with the lowest number of points to win. It is difficult to plan ahead most times as you'll never know what our opponent is playing and this makes it faster for a player to select a piece (Whoohoo! No analysis paralysis) This does not mean that there is no strategy in the game just that the luck element is a little more evident. However this game seems to go on forever and hence the lower rating

Try Dec/07: enjoyable; easier to read than the 6 Nimmt cards, so better that way.

Good fun... who's gonna step in the poo? Best with 3-4 players, with more it gets way too chaotic and looses all elements of tactics.

The 6 Nimmt! board game, I loved it.  Not everyone else is going to share my feelings but that's okay.  If you love the purity of 6 Nimmt!, this may not be for you.  The core game is still 6 Nimmt!: You play a card (a tile) face down then everyone flips them over.  It is then placed on the board in normal 6 Nimmt! fashion, except that if you "underbid" (for lack of better words), your tile goes next to the highest tile on the board.  What's also cool is that this can be played with 2 or 3 players, something that I don't usually like to do with 6 Nimmt - and like the original, it can play up to 8 players and MAY be less chaotic with alot of players.  Also, in order to get new tiles, you need to buy them or completely run out of them.  Anytime during the game, you can buy up to 3? (or was it 2?) new tiles for 1 point a piece OR if you completely run out, you get 6 for free (tough to do).  My second favorite game of Essen.

If you really, REALLY like 6 nimmt you might wanna buy this one but for most I'd recommend just buying 6 nimmt.

RATING: 6
6 Nimmt the board game! I guess I would rather just play 6 nimmt!. The card game is faster. There were some interesting things about the board game- like there are spaces that give negative points (which helps since you want low score). I would certainly play this game again but I am not sure when or why. I like the card game

RATING: 6
As this is 6Nimmt with cowbells and whistles, some newbies found this confusing. 6Nimmt was easier to understand and play. But I bought Tanz because 6Nimmt became monotonous and the boardgame does provide mental variety in play. 

It's interesting that the boardgame increases the desire to target/avoid a particular spot in the middle of an active row, and sometimes you want to place into the penalty boxes due to the happy cows being activated. However the increase in options such as buying tiles or playing two in a round leads to slow play with some players. 

Tanz is more fun than the cardgame as plans backfire when certain effects are activated or deactivated against your wishes. But some players complain about the luck involved. I'd imagine with more than 4 players things will be more interesting, especially as only one pawn can occupy a space on the scoring track. But the scoring track's constant reminder of your situation either makes things more tense or more hopeless for some personalities. Determining the order of numbers played is still too long winded with more than 6 players as with the cardgame, which I still prefer (interested in the gold edition). In fact the tiles are so small to make determination even more difficult.The boardgame loses a point for being less portable than it's predecessor.

RATING: 6
The boardgame version of 6 Nimmt! This is as entertaining and the gameplay is even trickier than the card game version. However, in order to make the game different enough from 6 Nimmt!, they have naturally added some new gameplay and scoring rules, and while the new rules add flavour and reduce the monotony and repetitiveness of the card game, they also take away its simplicity and refinement and also introduce further chaos (during 2-card rounds, positive scoring rounds, and face-up play rounds.)  For these reasons, particularly the added chaos, I give this game a 6, one half point less than the card game.

Kind of chaotic, but then we had a fully-loaded eight-player board for my only session so far! (Update: still chaotic with only 7 players.)

RATING: 7
Plays a few, plays a lot of people.  Takes the 6 Nimmt! mechanic and adds (for me) fun stuff on the board as the conditions can change depending on the round.  This adds variety for the better in my opinion.  Sure it can be a chaotic - but one needs to guage and manage the odds while doing so.  A nice fun diversion from heavier fare.

I'm starting to like this version better than the original, 6 Nimmt!. The ability to buy more tiles can help you out of a helpless situation for a minimal cost. Of course that doesn't always work ;-)

Szép kivitelezésű az egész, aranyosak a tábla rajzai is. Az nagy kérdés, hogy egy ilyen ötletből volt-e értelme táblás játékot készíteni, mert erre szerintem nem a válasz. Egy kicsit gondolkodósabb lett ezzel a játék, de annyira nem nagy az ötlet, hogy ez elvigyen egy táblás játékot. A büntetőpontok megoldása jó ötlet, viszont ezek maximalizálása azonban nem. Így a játékidő teljesen kiszámíthatatlan. Talán a szerencse szerepe is nagyobb, mint a kártyaváltozaténak.

[2012-03-03]
Igen, a szerencse a plusz pontok bejövetele miatt biztosan nagyobb, mint a kártyás esetén, viszont a játék külleme kellemesebb és viccesebb is emiatt a játék.

It is nice to have a game you can pull out for 8 players, although at that point it's pretty much total chaos (as compared to almost total chaos with fewer.   Any game where you go diving into a dung heap at the end is an entertaining game, though, and the poop jokes fly!

Nice board game variant of the popular Take 5! It's similar, yet different enough. I still suck at this. Don't feel the need to own it, but would like to play again.

This is never going to be a huge favorite with me, but it does accommodate a large number of players for lighthearted fun with just a smidgen's variation in the decisions to be made from turn to turn, and that's not a bad thing.

The card game is very random but it's just a light opener and there's still some strategy so it works there.  This game is even MORE random and it's NOT an opener.  6 Nimmt is a fun and clever game that just doesn't work as a board game.

A funny game with a funny theme, "Dance of the Bullheads". Quite a bit of a luck factor in this one though. You actually want the lowest score in this game. And remember... always try to avoid the cow patties!

Egy picit jobban tetszik mint a kártyás verzió, fôleg a táblajáték formátumból származó elônyök miatt(lepények,vidám tehén stb). Jó szórakozás több játékosnak valamennyire még gondolkodni is kell.

Better than 6 nimmt! More interesting (special fields, like "open bid" or "plus points") and with some more control of the game. But it still is a party game.

Ez egy Vigyáz(z)6! némi apró átalakítással:
- a lapkát (kártyát) ami kissebb mindegyik sor utolsó lapkájánál, azt a legnagyobb zárólapka után kell tenni a sorba. Tehát nem viszi a sort autómatikusan.
- különböző hosszúak a sorok, és a megfelelő szabály szerint folyton záródnak és nyílnak meg a sorok. Minden pillanatban 4 sor aktív
- bizonyos körülmények között nyilt kör van, ahol a legrosszabbul álló játékos már a többiek által kijátszott lapka ismeretében játszik ki lapkát.
- bizonyos körülmények között két lapkát teszünk ki a kör elején

Az apró változtatások bonyolultabbá tették a játékot, és szerintem ez nem vált előnyére. Az eredeti játék is elég esetleges volt, de egyszerűsége és gyorsasága ezt ellensúlyozta. Ez így már nem olyan egyszerű és gyors.

Nekem nem igazán jött be a játék.

6 Nimmt cleverly transformed into a boardgame. For those who know 6 Nimmt it has just enough familiarity and just enough new concepts; it's not too simple, not too complicated, not too short, not too long, and the artwork's nice and funny as well. In short - they couldn't have done it better!

Sure, it's just 6 Nimmt / Category 5. But Wallace added some neat stuff on the board, like the times you must play 2 tiles per turn, and the times that points are subtracted instead of added.  Fun!

Printed and laminated the English Rules & also pasted the 8 Screens with English instructions....lots of hardwork getting the screens completed. 

It's OOP so we were delighted to get a brand new last copy from our local store Pi. They told us it was the only copy. Tried very hard to get Pi to try to source for another copy as a birthday gift for our buddy. PI called back abt a week later and said they managed to get another copy for me. Had given it to Jerry during our buddies' dinner gathering at Sukiya Marina Sq on 10 Jun 11.

Really fun concept. I'm always into coop games that play fast. Only worry a little about a possible dominant player when you play with a larger group. But I think that most people I'd be able to play this with really would participate anyway.

Wonderful game where a boardgame and an app come together. The challenge of describing what you see in a meaningful way is both difficult and satifying (when finding out the other picked it up correctly). The game could use a few improvements (especially component wise).  I assume the maze will be different each time you play, otherwise I'd rate this game a bit lower (replayability is a must here and possible imo, especially with an app).

Hasbro version has some terrible components, but the price is admittedly very low. As a game, this is pretty fun riding its gimmick to the hilt. It's all about communication and conveying information quickly, then trying to assemble different pieces of that puzzle together. 

My only concern is that we graduated to hard difficulty almost immediately and still haven't lost yet. I'm worried it's a bit too easy for experienced gamers who quickly nail the strategy.

Very clever game that blends technology and tactile pieces.  Each player is dropped into a virtual maze and has one minute to describe their surrounds to the other players, who try to recreate that description in cardboard tiles and chits.  Eventually, the players will have seen the entire maze, and by looking at things that overlap -- does that T-junction with the statue and the plant seem identical to that other T-junction with the statue and the plant? -- you fit everything together as best you can.  The app then instructs you to move a statue through the maze in a particular path.  If you've built the maze correctly, you win!

The cardboard mask is ingenious, and holds your iPhone/Android to create the VR experience.  It gives me a terrible headache, unfortunately, but nobody else in my group has had a problem with it.

Replayablity seems a little low given there's only sixteen mazes.

The excitement that my 10 & 12 yr olds experienced when we first played this was a joy to behold. Brilliant use of technology in a board game. I expect this game to start an avalanche of similar type games in the next year or two.

Mask of Anubis was one of the most innovative games I played in a while. I really love the app implementation in this one. We had a great time playing it. BUT. I think there are too little dungeons in the game as it is and would like some more variability since I feel you can very easily play through all of them and then it loses its charm. If they made a map generator, though, I would buy it instantly.

Very impressive VR like game where you have 7 times to look insode a pyramid for a short time while your teammates try to figure out - based on your explanations - how it is built up. Good communication and dimensional thinking is everything in this game ^^. Its a party hit.

Not much to it - very gimmicky.

After 2 plays i can't really imagine it has anything else to offer. Once you have worked out what language to use it's pretty trivial.

Original and fun system, where players have to deveolp a "language" to describe labyrinths. Im not sure it has legs, because the mazes are simple and have a bit too much of information on them, but its a fin system. A few clunky rules though abou when you can work on the mazes and talk about them.,

This is the one in which you download a smartphone app, insert the phone into an elaborate headset to create a VR viewer and then take turns to describe different parts of maze while the others frantically try to reconstruct it with tiles. Not sure I'd want to play it often but I definitely value uniqueness.

brilliantly implemented VR, but it's kind of party-ish and warrants having more than 2p to be at its best

There's nothing quite like it, it is its own category. High quality components, the mask is also solid. The app could use some polish in EN version, some more levels wouldn't hurt either. But it's an extraordinary experience nevertheless. There are various attempts at making the board game work together with some digital device. This is an example of doing it right.

Simple idea, but absolutely brilliant. I first played this game with my wife, her younger brother and her father (68 yo), and we all had an absolute blast. Then I played with my wife, her older brother, his girlfriend, and her daughter (9 yo), and it worked just as great with them!

The game is easy to understand, but describing what you see in the mask and converting what someone else describes into pieces on the table can be very difficult. This game will certainly teach you to communicate clearly :)

This could very well be the perfect game to play with non-gamers.

My wife and her younger brother had some issues with motion sickness, but that was pretty much alleviated by setting the time limit to infinite. Once they stopped being in a hurry as they were looking around, they were much more comfortable.

There is one tiny negative I have with Mask of Anubis, but it's really not something I can see a good way to design away. And that's the fact that you need to have your phone charged. In most other games that uses an app, it would work perfectly fine to have your phone on the charger, as long as you have an outlet nearby. But that doesn't work with Mask of Anubis, since the phone needs to sit in the mask and you need to be able to freely look around 360°. It's not a huge issue, but it's something to be aware of.

Side note: this is quite hard to get at the moment. Hasbro is going to release the game as "Mask of Pharaoh". I'd recommend checking that out if you can't get the original. The sequel, "Mask of Moai", is NOT a good substitute!

Unique teamwork puzzle challenge that depends on good communication and listening skills using a smart phone and app.  Construct a 3D Mask of Anubis that houses a smart phone used to activate a virtual tour view of an Egyptian Tomb.  Varying difficulty of maze maps. Take turns wearing the mask and describing your one minute astral projected view of a section of the maze relying on furnishings and spotting Jr. Anubis walking through walls. The other players arrange tiles to match the maze description.  At the end, hopefully the maze is a perfect recreation that leads to the scenario objective.  Watching it played makes you want to try it.  Seeing the game played from afar draws buzz and curiosity as you watch a person put a dorky cardboard wolf eared mask on their face and frantically explain walls and statues and corridors.  This game is an interesting marriage of cardboard and bytes.

Original game, that combines VR with boardgaming.  You need to communicate well with the team members in order to solve the puzzle.  This coop game is less suffering from the "leader aspect" as are so many others.  Probably mainly because every player sees a different scene, so nobody has a complete view of the whole situation. . The maze gets complexer in higher levels so the game has a high replayability.

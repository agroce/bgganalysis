Was introduced to this great deckbuilder at EuroQuest 2015, and I've preordered a copy. The theme may not grab anyone but serious science/space nerds, but the game play is really great, with many options with every turn, and the card artwork is striking and well designed.

I enjoy the idea of flipping deck builders on their head and deconstructing them, per TC Petty III's intention here, but I do think that this game is a bit fiddlier with AIR than I prefer. It's not entirely deep enough to warrant it being a "thinkier" deck builder/anti-deck builder, and not light enough to be quick and satisfactory. Still, it's a very strong design for its intention, and the market row and bidding tokens are a good development over previous design choices in this genre.

A reasonably fun deck builder with a curiously original theme, extracting xenon from air by separating out nitrogen, oxygen, etc..  Since I am not a huge deck builder gamer, I can't say that I am eager to play this game again, but certainly deck-builder fans should give this game a try.

This game didn't click when I played it.  Couldn't see the engine.  My opponents weren't much help either - played with randoms at a convention, and I'm not sure anyone at the table really understood what was going on.

Watched some friends playing this over the past weekend, and things seemed to make a little more sense.  Would like to play this again in the future to see if I can make heads or tails of it.

Another deck-thinning game in the vein of Valley of the Kings. Here, you have to 'mine' deliver Xenon to fulfill contracts. But useful Xenon unfortunately comes in packets of air, which comes with completely useless Nitrogen, Oxygen and Krypton, which must be culled from your decks as quickly as possible. It's a unusual yet charming theme.

The difference with Valley of the Kings is how it uses cards. The cards of XP are completely one use and one use only. So, for example, Money is separate resource unlike in many deck-builders, used mostly to buy special ability cards. So it is a bit more verbose compared to other 'small-deck' deck-builders.

The art design is quite nice, with a slick modern look and goes nicely with the theme.

Highly recommended.

Deck building with a twist. I think this might be in the land of deck-building limbo. It's not quite light enough to play with non-gamers but there's not enough meat on this bone for regular gamers to really get hooked by it either.

I bought this to have an "X" game to play in the Copy of Alphabetic Boardgaming Challenge (our 1st). I'd also heard it was a decent game which was a second requirement. It does seem like a decent game with an interesting deck-building, deck-filtering/distilling aspect. My one play went well, though just learning how the game works. Nothing earth-shattering here, but the adding of air / distilling of elements and the bid mechanics are straightforward and work well. I look forward to playing it more... and as our "X" game sometime in the future.

Early days, but like this a lot. Fresh theme and clever mechanics, more a deck deconstructor than a deck builder, and the graphic design is both spot on theme wise and a big help when playing the game.

All in all - great little game.

Playing this a lot, seriously - every game session it feels like. Everyone likes it, clever design, clever graphic design. Only negatives are remembering the setup is 3 cash and the expansion (which seems a bit unbalanced and unnecessary)

After one play i would like to play it again. If you like deck building games, this game does away with the traditional deck building ideas and has you trying to run through each hand to bank Xenon to fill contracts you've purchased in previous rounds. 

I've heard some complaints about imbalances. I cant speak on that, but I like the direction this game is going, something different in the deckbuilding world and worth a try.

Someone in our group has it, so i dont feel like i need to buy it.

A surprising deck builder that packs a good punch for a small box game.  What makes it fun and fresh is that in order to propel yourself you need to actively make your deck worse.  But, on the flip side, you always feel like you are making progress in thinning your deck every turn.  Quick playing and addictive, it gives you the feeling of "I can do better next game". A solid surprise.

RATING: 6
A very beautiful game that integrates real world technology and xenon applications into an innovative set of mechanics.  On one play, my impression was that the game offers many card synergies that might be interesting to explore, but that it suffers a bit from low player interaction.  Executive summary:  beautiful multi-player solitaire with good theme integration.  N.B. - playing time likely to be longer than the 30 minutes suggested by the publisher; 45-60 minutes seems more accurate.

Terrific deck-builder with a unique theme and unique mechanisms - you're deconstructing your deck as well as constructing it.  Theme involves using your air separation facility to elements of air trying to isolate Xenon to fulfil contracts that earn points, and also installing upgrades that make your facility/system more efficient.

[thread=1541231][/thread]

I do have a concern with a start player advantage in cases where the start player ends the game, as explained [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/22294994#22294994]here[/url], and in [thread=1584421]this thread[/thread].  I think the solution is to have an equal number of turns before applying the benefit of the reward token, and reducing its benefit to 2 points.

I’m at a crossroads with this one. On the positive side, I find the “take a packet of air” mechanism (if you want income) combined with only being able to distill one element per turn quite challenging and clever. That’s the conceit of the game and it works very well.

But where the game falters is in the upgrade cards. I simply don’t think they’re near balanced with the result that there are game winning cards and sucker cards. For example, there’s a card for $5 that allows you to draw a card and either take it or discard it. For $7, your opponent can distill ALL his oxygen. That $2 difference is negligible to the great difference in card powers. In this game, discarding is treading water and distilling is swimming, and you can’t win a race by treading water. Consequently, I can’t help but feel there are some cards that are simply foolish to buy not only because they’re underpowered but because you may very well reveal a better card from the deck for your opponents.

Perhaps future plays will reveal ways to go about winning with cards that feel underpowered that I don’t yet see or the expansion cards offer extra ways to go about winning, but so far our games have been decided by whoever got a distillation power plus something else for an unbeatable combo. You can pretty much call the game at that point. If we’re all looking for the same things and the game simply comes down to when the cards come out and who has the money to buy them, well that’ll be disappointing. 

As I said, I’m at a crossroads but still motivated to play the game and see how things shake out.

RATING: 6
Solid mechanics, and overall it's well-designed. The primary refining mechanism introduces new dynamics to deck building (though IMHO not necessarily super fun on its own). The use of bid tokens in particular is innovative, and about the only credible attempt I've seen to mitigate the timing flaws that arise in games with typical market offers.

So, strictly on those counts, the game is worth playing if you get a chance, and it's a game I've studied as a designer. 

Yet, the theme of this game is about building out industrial refining infrastructure to  efficiently extract xenon gas from air. It's thematic, and it works. and while it's not often that I'd critique a game mainly for theme, that's where I'm at with this one.

The following points are entirely and deeply subjective, so YMMV.

Let me be clear that some respect is due to T.C. and EGG for daring to double down on the dull, industrial engineering theme. Indeed, the theme is certainly NOT pasted on in this game—it's woven through and through. But IMHO that is to the game's detriment.

I'd argue it would be better to paste on an inherently more engaging theme than go balls-in on a dull theme to avoid accusations of pasting. And maybe that's not what this is. Regardless, an engaging theme, pasted or not, serves a critical purpose in transmuting playable math into an experience that is sought out by players. In the absence of overriding principle, the designer's default choice should be to choose an approach for a game to give it the highest player appeal, and so sometimes you just need to whip out the glue...

In this case, imagine Splendor, but instead of gathering and trading jewels from exotic locales, you fire up your bleak industrial manufacturing infrastructure and negotiate chemical purchase contracts. The game kinda feels like that to me. 

Instead, why not some unobtainium profiteering with greedy aliens in a dangerous, sci-fi future? Spice mining on Arakis while fending off giant sandworms and scheming political rivals? Even a game about filtering out dangeous pollutants from water (and then selling them to evil corporations to mind control the sheeplike population?! sorry) would have more life. Just anything to give the game some fantasy and vitality would be an improvement IMHO.

Unfortunately, the gameplay itself doesn't rise enough above the crowd to suspend the feeling of dullness as is, and the nondescript corporate theme plus the clipart-like graphics don't do it any favors. The result for me is a feeling of engaging with a well-crafted but nearly themeless abstraction.

Solid as it is, the game was never going to be a massive hit (and that's ok; few will be), but a different theme could have given it a notable niche to inhabit and a legacy longer than I expect it will have. But hey, the name *is* pretty cool. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In summary, here's hoping T.C. redevelops this solid game with a more lively theme.

P.S. And what the hell are "MDMA Representatives" (one of the cards)—is that a drug reference?

the game got too samey for us.  no real variety in strategy or gameplay.  I enjoyed the game, and it is very unique in playstyle for a deckbuilder... but I prefer having games with legs.  And it seemed like (perhaps due to poor play) the person who got the most pipelines won the game. I tried very hard to make attempt "installing" technology, but only getting 1 vp means they drag you down quite a bit.  Save your money for pipelines.

RATING: 6
Cool theme that ties into the mechanisms well. I enjoy the game, though there is a very clear imbalance in some of the cards that doesn't seem quite made up for by the differences in cost. I also think the game needs something to mitigate first player advantage. My first guess would be second player gets to place a bid token, third gets a buck, and fourth gets both. I would guess that the designers tried at least a couple means of balancing away the first player advantage, and maybe it horribly broke things. If so, I'm more than willing to concede to their playtesting.

One thing I really like about the game-- I dislike most deckbuilders that don't let you thin your deck out or make it rare/difficult to do so. A trash mechanism is built right into the rules and turn structure for Xenon Profiteer and is absolutely critical for success. A+ would trash again.

Graphic design is lousy. Hexes for costs? The hex is pretty much reserved for spaces on boards and victory points now. Little pipes showing you where to place pipeline cards on the bottom of the player card makes it more difficult to slide your player card off of the table to flip it over (happens several times throughout a game). Easily enough fixed by simply placing pipeline cards at the top, but it's daft.

The most egregious design issue is the flow of the turn as printed on the player cards. It clearly reads that distilling is necessary to play xenon, but this is absolutely not the case. You isolate xenon for free if it is the only element left in your hand after distilling. I played two games before I finally saw somebody "distill" two elements when they weren't supposed to be able to do so, and when I asked them how they did it they looked at me blankly. The flow should show distilling either N, O, or Kr and then a substep of isolating Xe. It was taught properly, and yes I was ultimately the one that didn't internalize the rule. But that simple change would have made it more difficult to make that mistake.

I've played 3 times. I've got maybe 3 more plays before I tire of it, though we'll see if playing a few more times with the proper rules gives it longer legs for me.

I think I enjoyed this more than any standard deckbuilder since you can get your action cards out in front of you going off every turn and thus don't have to worry about seeing your perfect combo all at once. And this seemed to me a much more powerful use of money than buying new cards. And putting the deck thinning aspect of deckbuilders front and center was a nice twist. You get a free, somewhat limited, thinning action every turn but many of the action cards make the thinning much more powerful. And the whole point of the game is getting rid of the useless cards in your hand so you can get to the ones you use to buy points. Plus the game felt pretty quick playing and I really enjoyed the art. But my main reservation is that it felt like it would play basically the same every time. Definitely worth playing once or twice, but my guess is not much more than that.

RATING: 8.5
Picked up at Essen. Really good take on the deckbuilding genre, in that you need to cull your deck a lot, and that is part of the theme. Also you can permanently 'bind' your cards to the tableu, so you are sure to use theme every round, only it is more expensive and therefore you might have to skip on other upgrades in order to pull it off. I also like that the currency (money) is tokens rather than being on the cards for once in this genre of game. The manual is hillarious - very well done!

RATING: 7
This one is a cool twist on deck-building with players adding air packets to their decks (sets of four cards - Nitrogen, Oxygen, Krypton & Xenon) and then trying to separate the xenon cards from the others in their hands in order to fulfill contracts for xenon. Players get money for adding air which they can use to upgrade their abilities to more quickly process out the xenon, get money for the waste, or get points for meeting other criteria. It is an engine-building game, to be sure, but adding 3/4 waste to your deck in order to extract the 1/4 value is unlike any other deck-builder I've played. Different enough from my other deck management games to keep around for a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The theme is simply amazing. You are distilling Xenon from air in order to fulfill contracts. There are four element cards: Neon, Oxygen, Krypton, and Xenon. Taking one of each card is called a packet of air. Your job is to remove the non-Xenon elements in order to distill the precious Xenon. The thematic integration is excellent and is clearly the result of someone who has close ties to the real-world process. The rulebook even has a paragraph at the back explaining why Argon is missing from the air. As a scientist, I absolutely love this level of fidelity.

[b]A deck-destruction game[/b]
Xenon Profiteer manages to breath fresh air into the tiered and overused deck-building mechanism. The game forces you to take these packets of air, 75% of which you don't want! The game play is centered around riding your deck of the unwanted elements as efficiently as possible. The result is a deck-builder that feels very different from other games in the genre. I have had great success introducing this game to people who claim to hate deck-builders. 

[center][ImageID=2962993][/center]

[b]A breadth of strategies[/b]
I bought the game as soon as I got back from the Gathering and have played it 8 times now. I've tried several different strategies and have been pleasantly surprised at the variety of options the cards allow. 

Don't get me wrong, the game is pretty simple, but there are dozens of technology cards that give you special abilities and synergies exist. The different strategies are not radically different from one another, but the cards you buy do have a significant influence on your game. This keeps repeated plays interesting and different.

I have yet to play this with someone who didn't care for it. People consistently tell me it's a 7 or 8 for them. Several of my friends have bought their own copies as well. The game offers just enough stuff for the short playtime (~45min). I'm looking forward to the expansion.

I wanted to like this game more than I did, and I haven't yet given up. The theme is wonderful. I was even able to have a conversation with a friend about Xenon, since he works with some of these gases, and I was able to demonstrate a little bit of knowledge that I had gleaned from playing this game.

The main issue I have here is a common one - it takes too long. I played with some slow players, but even so, it seems like it takes about 30 minutes. If it was half that, it would be much more satisfying. But the bigger problem is the Dominion issue. Why play this instead? I can't come up with a good reason.

Very interesting deck building game, very clever mechanisms, fresh theme... but "Structure Packed Columns" is overpowered. In all of our games it has been in the winner system installed. It is expansive, but only 2 coins more (totaling 9) than other interesting cards and if you get it early it always saves you five to six Xenon out of 10-15 you normally need to end the game. This means also five or six times less air to introduce to the system etc. I would not say this card alone wins a game. But it always wins a game together with a second card the speed up distilling. And this is the problem...

02-16-2016 - Reading the rules I thought this game looked pretty amazing.

It wasn't bad and I'd play again, but it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.  6

A solid deck "culler".   You are trying to distill Nitrogen, Oxygen and Krypton out of your deck to get a Xenon and fill orders.  There are cards that give you special abilities.  The basic game is fine, but there seem to be combos that are dominant.  I found the game fun, but I wonder if there is much replayability once you have discovered all of the limited combos.  It seems that this game desperately needs a number of expansions to reduce the chance of overpowered combos.

Really not a bad game.  Kind of fun to upgrade your machine with new components to get special abilities.  I don't know that I'll get it as I have other games like it, but it's fine.  I did put a combo together where I was making a guaranteed 2 points every turn and won by a pretty significant margin.  My opponent said it's "broken" and I just claimed that I'm really awesome :)  Maybe it was a bit of both! ;)

* Quick and enjoyable deck-builder
* Interesting theme and well-incorporated into gameplay (eg the "Air" action)
* Different strategies abound, but "rush" strategy (first to five contracts or improvements) seems powerful
* Expansions largely unnecessary
* Good for fans of this mechanic and science themed games

This is a delightful little theme: competing industrial xenon purifying facilities, you have to manage cards including waste products like oxygen and nitrogen which come from purifying out the xenon - but the waste products are also methods of getting cash. Great fun for the correct group of players.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/4fP8LnG1xyQ

I am a huge fan of deck builders and this is one of my favourites. I usually enjoy attacking the other player more than gaining victory points ala dominion but in the theme in this game is perfect. You are attempting to collect Xenon which enables you to complete contracts which in turn give you your victory points. Along the way you will distill useless elements out of your deck, while trying to install permanent upgrades. It all hangs together on the central console card which shows you exactly where all the cards go. The graphic design is stunning. If you are a fan of deck builders check it out.

This game is interesting. I like it, but the theme is very quirky. I think fans of Carl Chudyk games will enjoy this, as it has multi-use cards that can be "plugged in" around your central player board, which is a single card in this case. I just couldn't get into the game that much because the theme was so foreign to me. There are some cool ideas here, but I'm not sure it's as exciting or replayable as I would want a game like this to be.

[b]Xenon Profiteer[/b]

[i]I'm not a fan of most deck builders, but I had fun playing this one. The whole game is predicated on constantly thinning your deck in order to get Xenon cards on the table which allow you to score points. The cards in you buy can either stay in your hand and be played for free when you draw them or purchased outright and they become a permanent part of your machine to extract Xenon. It played quick and there is some long strategy in the game based on which machine parts you buy and possibly build. There is also an interesting bidding system where you can reserve cards, however if someone really wants that card they'll pay you a $ for each bidding token you have on that card.

*I will mention one potential problem I saw with a specific card that let you permanently pay one less Xenon for every VP card you bought. The player who got this card in our game ran away with it. It also happened in another game my buddy played. That card really seems to be overpowered, it provides a huge edge for the person who happens to draw that card. I'd definitely like to play more, but it's not one I'm looking to pick up right now.[/i]

Xenon Profiteer is an engine-building deck-building game. Players add cards representing four elements into their deck--nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, and xenon. However, only the xenon cards are actually worth anything--if no element cards besides xenon are in your hand, you can put them in your score pile and later turn them in for contracts worth points and money. Throughout the game, players are drafting various machine parts that will let them more efficiently rid their deck of the other elements so that they can score the xenon. There are some clever ideas here, and a number of different strategies can propel a player to victory.

Fun deck building/ trashing game. Interesting game play and gorgeous graphic design. Pretty. I like that you have to do things in order and you can buy cards to help discard cards.

RATING: 8
This is a really straightforward deck builder game.  I wish they gave way more of the element cards because in a four player game you can and probably will run out of elements to make packets of air.

It's a must to create packets of air as you play the game which is probably the most annoying thing about the game.

(Who did beat me at our first game of Splendor) but alas, eh was not even close on this one.  We had. Fun time playing together and I expect this will hit the table more.

Very interesting twist to the deckbuilding genre. You are actually un-building your deck in this game trying to clear out all of the bad gas so that you can score the xenon. I have only played this game once but it plays in a relatively short time and offers some good decision making that is pretty thematic. If I played it more, my rating could go higher. The theme and art are not as fantastical and eye catching as other games, but it is kind of realistic and I can appreciate that.

We've still only played this once, even though all of us thought it was a perfectly decent game. Good enough that I considered rating it a 7, but it's not ultimately very compelling so I think 6 is enough for now.

I don't actually remember too many details of the mechanics now, as that game was a few months ago. It's essentially a deck builder but with some other bits thrown in. Nothing special, but a bit different and quite good.

I'd heard about this a lot on the State of Games podcast. First game, I did terribly -- barely anything on the table when W ended it. Partly because I kept drawing a rainbow hand, and partly because of a lot of bad choices! Second game I did better, while W drew those crappy hands. Pretty clever deck building/thinning mechanism! Need additional plays, though, to confirm the various upgrades can compensate for crappy draws.

RATING: 6
This game is a deck building game with the theme of collecting gasses and isolating out the ones that get you points...I guess.

There are 4 gasses that comprise your deck of ascending tiers.  On your turn you can thin out the lowest tier of gas in your hand, if you are left with just the highest tier of gas then you can place that on the table and collecting enough will allow you to complete mission cards for points at game end.  You can also add new sets of all 4 gasses to your deck for money and use that money to buy equipment that makes the filtering of your gasses more efficient in one way or another.

The game works well, everything is well designed and flows pretty smoothly.  Once the game got up to speed, even with new players in the game, everything is easy to understand and turns and the game in general move at a really good pace.  At first glance I did not think this would be the case though, it certainly looks more daunting than it is though.

I just don't see the point of this game.  "Fine" or "okay" are not that complimentary adjectives to describe a game any more with SO many options out there.  And this game is just fine or okay.  There are a ton of deck builders that do what this does just as well or better so where does this one set itself apart?  It certainly isn't the theme which is so nebulous I didn't understand it or care to.  There's really nothing impressive about the art design.  So ultimately just a very forgettable game.

A small package delivering a pretty good game. The deck filtering twist on more standard deck-builders is nice. Fantastic combo engines aren't too hard to pull off. It doesn't overstay it's welcome. Just don't expect a small set of cards to deliver the infinite replayability of larger deck-builders with all of their expansions.

I do feel like there are a few card-balance issues that lower the games rating for me. Pipe-lines seem exceedingly random and unfair in the 3 and especially 4 player games. The bid and buy cards ability to completely remove the down-side of flipping your card to the overdrive side is also easily abused.

With a little more development or some house-rules, this one might be an 8 for me. But as is I'll go with 7.

We're loving this engine builder / deck deconstruction game.  Who knew that Isolating Xenon could be so much fun?  Really interesting take on deck builders with some very different options like being able to permanently Install an Upgrade card to your system which allows the use of the card every turn.  The bidding tokens can be used very strategically to either reduce the cost of cards you purchase or increase the cost of cards for your opponents which can really affect the tempo of the game.  

Quality of the card stock is top notch, and the artwork is gorgeous.  Lots of theme and the rule book is very well written and tongue in cheek hilarious.  

Playtime is around 30 minutes which feels about right.  There are no broken cards, but several of the combinations took it right to the edge.  Several very viable paths to victory.   Wife approved!

Clever! It's a deck-building game where the primary mechanic is deck-thinning. The theme is surprisingly charming and well implemented. For the first half of the game, I was loving it. There are plenty of card combinations to discover, each with their own subtle interactions. Still, there are never so many options that you feel overwhelmed, or like you can't pay attention to what everyone else is trying to accomplish. This latter feature is important because it lends the game a sense of player interaction that is missing in many multi-player deck-building games unless you have sufficient experience to understand both your own plan and also those of everyone else. It's a feature, but also perhaps the game's drawback because...

The second half of the game is less intriguing. It seems the game either drags on too long or else loses all of its tension. As the decks run low and your opportunities to complete certain combinations dwindle, things wind down naturally -- but without the enjoyable feeling that everyone is racing for last points. Instead, players are merely finishing up what they started, which seems fairly obvious. Perhaps with fewer or more experienced players I'd enjoy this just a little more. As of right now, however, I'm only willing to say that it's a very solid game (which is still a very good thing).

Fantastic card game that deserves to fly higher on the radar than it is. There isn't another game out there quite like it; it's the only "deck thinning" game I've really ever seen.

Xenon Profiteer is a deckbuilding game with a rare theme.  You play as a corporation that extracts Xenon from the atmosphere and uses it to complete contracts for products that use Xenon, like medical equipment and entertainment display devices.

In the game there are packets of 'air' which include Nitrogen, Oxygen, Krypton and Xenon.  You're trying to purge your deck of the first three elements and to get hands that only contain Xenon... which let's you 'isolate' it.  At which point it becomes spendable. 

There are two card rows.  One row is upgrades and the other is contracts.  Upgrades are cards that can be added to your deck as special actions/abilities... or alternatively installed as permanent abilities.  Contracts are simply ways to turn Xenon into points and money.  There's also pipelines which increase your hand size and give points.

On a normal turn, you either 'air' or 'wipe'.  Air-ing means taking the four cards that represent a packet of air and 2 bucks.  Wiping flushes a card row and refills it with new cards.  Then you must either bid or buy.  Bidding puts a token on one of the cards in the card row.  That item can't be wiped anymore.  Furthermore, when it is bought, you get a buck for each of your bid tokens on it.  Buying is simply paying the appropriate amount of money and taking a card.  Upgrades have a purchase cost and an install cost (you can buy and install in a single go if you can afford it).  Contracts have no cost and just hang out until you can complete them... but you can only be working on one at a time.

The game ends when any player gets either 5 upgrades or 5 contracts.  The person who triggers the end of the game has a choice... take 3 points or get a final turn at the end of the game.  All the other players get another turn.  Every upgrade is worth a point, some upgrades give you bonus points, contracts are worth the face value  and every 5 bucks is a point.

Xenon Profiteer has an interesting take on deck-building that is more about deconstructing your deck rather than making it better. The reason is for this is that it is a game about mining. Your deck is the dirt and you are digging for gold. I am speaking metaphorically of course, since thematically what you are doing is distilling gasses from air samples to be sold for profit.

A couple of other games have tried this approach, but I think this is the first one that gave it a good thematic reason to be that way. It plays quick once you know the flow of the game, usually under thirty minutes. It is a little fiddly due to the constant building of the "air packets" you will have to mine, but if someone sets up a few between turns it's not deal breaker. There's also a fair bit of engine building as well, since you can add modules to your "machine" to accelerate the mining process. That breaks up the monotony of the process and creates a real sense of accomplishment when you are spitting out five or six cards a turn out of your machine and striking Xenon gold every other turn.

I don't know what kind of legs it is going to have though, which is my only real concern. There is very little player interaction other than buying cards other people need. There also seems to be only two real strategies, playing a long game and saving up for big point contracts or trying to playing out cheap cards as fast as possible to end the game before the big contract players can finish out.

My final rating will likely depend on how that plays out.

RATING: N/A
Economic deck builder variant to distill noble Xenon gas from the atmosphere to sell in lucrative contracts for use in various cutting edge technologies. It's a race to fill contracts as players manage plant upgrades, store xenon, and enter into contracts at their player consoles. Deck building is unique because you are forced to add unwanted elements to your deck from the air packets. Each turn, utilize hand management and plant upgrades to slough the unwanted elements from your hand to distill pure unadulterated xenon.  Polluting your deck and having to trash cards is a unique and interesting deck building mechanic. I like the bid and buy interaction to keep cards from being wiped(Thurn!) and to pay or get paid on claimed upgrades or contracts. I also like the first out incentive token for the free points or a final scoring round.

RATING: 7
An off-the-beaten-path deckbuilder that may not appeal to medieval and renaissance geeks, but should appeal to science geeks.  

Xenon Profiteer is unusual in its inclusion of reserve bids for purchasable contracts/machinery, deck culling as a primary mechanism, the ability to go into overtime, and oodles of deck-stuffing air packets. And it's most certainly better than [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118174/compounded]Compounded[/url], the lame chemistry design.

I have some concerns as to whether some cards are so powerful that they might strongly influence a player's probability of victory, but only time will tell.  Importantly, this may go down in history as the only Kickstarter that I'm sorry that I missed.

The game flows much more quickly, by the way, if players premake air packets for easy grabbage instead of building packets every turn on the fly.

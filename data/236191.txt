LIKE: The arc in the game is so finely tuned. The timing comes down to when the player goes for points. This timing is subtle and intriguing.

DISLIKE: It helps to know successful card combinations in advance. Dry theme. The game has a negative inherent struggle to the mechanisms, so I don't think it will appeal to everyone.

OVERALL: Good! Strong play similarities to St. Petersburg, but is a bit more complex. I would play this again, but am not rushing to obtain it.

A weird kind of tableau builder where you're constantly tearing down your engine while still building more. It's odd that the game penalizes you for keeping cards in your hand, like you're not supposed to construct any kind of long-term strategy at all. This results in a feeling that you're always just blindly drawing cards and then trying to make them work, no matter the consequences. Maybe I just didn't get it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The card play is well designed and keeps the game flowing. You need to consider hand size, tableau state, poverty state, etc.,  while also grabbing good cards that are discarded to the display. The tableau building and city activation are the stars of the show. The decision as to how many stacks to pursue in your tableau, the fairly varied card effects and their activation combine to give this game a feeling that is apart from other drafting games. The borough cards and the bonuses also provide a welcome layer of decision making. However, due to the city activation resetting your tableau to a more basic state, there isn't much of a power curve to the tableau. That's fine in the abstract, since this game is about its card play, victory point accumulation, money management, and poverty management, but it makes the game feel a touch repetitive. That repetition can result in the feeling that this game lasts too long.

Let's also discuss the production of this game. The game itself is attractively produced but a number of the details are quite poorly done. The cards are fragile and start deteriorating at the first shuffle. The color on a number of the card backs is noticeably different from other cards. This is also true for the card fronts, but that doesn't make a difference in game play. The rule book is, for the most part, fine, but uses illogical emphasis and poorly constructed paragraphs. I'd give that critique a pass if they used consistent terminology on the cards, but that's not the case. There's a clear lack of careful editing and version control. For example, "expend" is used on some cards, but is not explained in the rule book (it means discard). As another example, "action" is used to denote the primary selection of a turn (e.g., develop, buy, activate, draw), but the term "action" is also used on the cards to incongruously indicate that the card can be played while developing without discarding another card from your hand. These issues should not be present in a 7+ year old design that has a short rule book and a simple rule set. More attention should have been given to the details of this game's production.  

One other issue, which is more of a nit pick, is the lack of a round overview on the back of the rule book (since they don't also give player aids). There was plenty of room to include one. It's not really needed, but would have helped new players familiarize themselves with the game during play.

***Update: So the cards were an issue that Osprey took action on. I appreciate the replacement cards.

RATING: 9
I've never played the first edition but my initial impressions of this game are very good. I could definitely see this rating going up with more plays as I discover the cards and play with some strategies. It's got similarities to tableau-builders/engine-builders but your engine is constantly getting rebuilt which is cool. Lots of good choices to make in regards to which cards to play, which ones to discard, when to run your city, how deep are you willing to go into poverty, when to buy boroughs, etc. It's not a quick game but it didn't feel like it outstayed it's welcome either. I would be hesitant to play this with 4 as the downtime might get high but at 3 it's fine and 2 might be the sweet spot. While the game itself could be themeless, I do love the theme of rebuilding London and I LOVE the card art in the second edition. Overall kudos to Osprey Games.


Update (Nov 2017): 8 => 9
Already moving up after a second play. I love the balance of needing to use a card to "develop" another one, managing your stacks, managing poverty, and the tight money market. It all feels like a finely tuned machine. I also love how the game is really simple to setup and teach so it's not daunting to play.

Wow, good game. Initial rating, 8, I suspect it may rise. I think DriveThru Review is spot on that if you like card games like San Juan, there is a good shot you'll like this. This game is different but I get a tiny hint of San Juan with more depth. Lovely art, beautiful buildings. The game has a fun, breezy feel despite the poverty tokens. Good customer service from Osprey Games, who quickly replaced a card with a minor issue.

RATING: 5
I was excited for this game because of the wonderful art and design in the second edition. The components are very nice, however the gameplay left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. I enjoy tableau building games and I was excited for the idea of choosing which cards to build and which to pay with (thereby giving them to your opponents). However, I didn’t realize how turn-to-turn everything would be. The game penalizes holding cards while running your city so that means that in practice you buildup a hand of cards, play them in pairs to establish your city, and run it with the majority of the cards being one use. Hopefully you made enough money to buy some borough cards and pay for your next round at this. It wasn’t dissatisfying, but the game didn’t really feel like it had any arc. It was pretty much the same thing over and over, trying to draw the right cards, decide how much money to spend, etc. I was hoping for a bit more. Other tableau builders (Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, etc.) feel more fun to play become of the escalation throughout the game. Luck of the draw can have an impact if your opponents are able to stumble upon the cards that work best for them. Of course there are ways to increase your card draw to ensure this happens, but it happened a few times to many in my games. 

Overall, it is a perfectly fine game but I wouldn’t say that it is a standout game for me. I really like the idea of building your tableau, managing what cards you give opponents, and dealing with poverty, but something just feels missing. I think maybe all of the cards are too samey and you never make much progress because most cards flip after running your city. Beautiful art, nice production, but repetitive gameplay and not really much of an "engine building" feel.

My comment on the [thing=65781]first edition[/thing]: 
"Martin Wallace does hand management. It's the typical feeling many Wallace games give: Strapped for cash, needing loans to invest or get out of trouble, hoping that all your efforts eventually pay out. I like it how clever combining and timing gives you an edge over your opponents. There's a bit of luck involved when cards become available. But the game already balances this a bit by having three separate card stacks. Great, game and less dry than some of Wallace's other classics."

This one improves upon the first in a number of ways:
- The map with boroughs is replaced by Borough cards. This cleans up the spatial placing and introduces some special abilities. It's cleaner and provides extra interesting options.
- Loans hurt you during play by generating poverty. There's an incentive now to pay your loans earlier than at the end of the game.
- The artwork. It's so much prettier than the first edition. Especially the big Borough cards.

It's not all rosy though, since the beautiful thick linen card stock makes shuffling harder. There's reports of edges chipping white quite fast. Both are easily fixed by using sleeves, but still.

See my ratings comment on first edition for how I feel about this game. The second edition, I think, is just a touch better, due to removing the board, which I always felt was a little tacked in feeling.

The artwork and presentation here are also great, which helps!

This game was light enough, and it didn't seem to overstay its welcome.

I liked the decision whether to expand your city (and make more piles of cards) or to limit what you do to keep poverty levels low.

I think I didn't take out enough loans, and I wasted turns trying to generate money instead. (Time, it should be noted, is also a resource that can be wasted.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Having played the first edition I will say I liked this edition better but it still does not do much to stand out for me. The art is great and I do like the fact that they got rid of the board as it does seem to turn this into more of a true card game. For a Wallace game it was punishing and there was a lot of poverty, but money was plentiful so there was no need to take loans. I imagine we could have taken loans to play some of the higher victory point cards, but since no one went after them we did just fine without them. A solid design for sure, but I feel this tableau builder is a more complex San Juan and is too just punishing to be fun.

RATING: 5
I have never played the first edition, was unaware even that there was a second edition of this game. I had no idea what to expect and entered the whole [i]tabula rasa[/i]. 

I was reminded, in a pleasant way, of much older Saint Petersburg which still hits my table on occasion, although I'm nearing the point where I'm done with it. (I don't play enough to level up to subtle timing and deck depletion strategies.) London 2nd ed. does quite similar things: cards need to be built, then give you stuff. But in order to avoid stagnant strategies, the engine is torn down every time it is run and rebuilt usin different cards, while at the same time carrying things over from previous installments (money, loans, poverty). It's very simple, but simple in a way I can handle: engine builders are not, and will not ever be, my forte. Accumulating poverty is unavoidable, and here the game shows a nice touch I always like in engine builders (Glen More does it too, for example): scoring is relative. That means the engine becomes about your efficiency compared to others, which in my opinion is a much more pleasing and natural way to compare them. It also offers a good selection of various strategies to pursue, and forces players to pay attention to what the opposition is doing.

One gripe I did have is that the game runs rather long for what it essentially is. Saint Petersburg is done in 40 minutes. This runs twice as long, easily. Perhaps the multitude of cards is necessary to tell a certain 'story' as well as allow for a good build-up of various aspects of all the little engines. But it does get repetitive near the end, and that costs the game a point. I also think the cards could have been printed on better stock: these are too thick and too rough with shuffling becoming, quite predictably, unpleasant. But I liked the game nonetheless, and for an engine builder that's high praise indeed.

Comments from the first edition of my favourite Martin Wallace game, with additional comments about the 2e coming later, as applicable ...

----------

Without question my favourite Martin Wallace game. 

Though I do like Brass and enjoy Age of Industry even more, my first two full play-throughs have made me realise that this is arguably Wallace's best game, especially in the one key factor that matters to me ... the sense that it clearly offers the best streamlined rules, mechanics and fun compared to depth of gameplay of any of his titles. Basically a very well-oiled card-management and area control game that's further wrapped up in a whole lot of Wallace goodness. 

It feels like you're still playing a classic Wallace game like Age of Industry or Brass, albeit in a highly polished, unique and delightful way. There's debt, loans, and never enough time to do everything you want, along with choices about how to develop and balance your play. Very deep that requires some serious thinking, but fortunately not painfully brain-burning like other Wallace games can be, if that makes any sense. Finally, London plays remarkably fast ... five minutes to teach, and 75 minutes to play with four players familiar with the game.

Also, surprisingly (!) for a Wallace game, despite it retaining many of the heavier economic-type mechanisms that Wallace is famous for in his designs (very tight economy, loans, accumulation of negative points i.e., poverty), this is a rare Wallace game that I have a great deal of fun playing.

Just didn't click for me.  Couldn't figure out how to make this game work.  And unlike other games, like The Gallerist, I couldn't even *feel* the game not working.  With The Gallerist, as an example, I feel my actions stalling out, being inefficient.  I don't get that here.

It seems very repetitive: build a small city, run it, buy borough(s), repeat.  The choices - how many piles? how many boroughs? when to run? - just didn't grab me.  The cards are completely uninteresting, primarily because there are only three resources: points, money, poverty.  There are no interesting combos between cards, and no opportunity to make an interesting strategic shift (like in, say, Race for the Galaxy).

I'd play it again if there was interest, but nothing is pulling me back to this one, so out it goes.

Much improved over the first edition of the game. There really isn't much missing without the map on the game board. Making the loans and poverty more punishing have also seemed to make opening moves less automatic. The font on the cards is quite small - it took me 2-3 minutes to finally find the A/B/C letters on the card fronts. The game does have randomness in terms of drawing from the deck and that could impact play some. Given the clean art, nicer card stock and the improved rules, I would recommend the second edition over the first. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A nice spruce up for what was already a pretty good game. The rule changes seem sensible in terms of removing the Borough spamming tactic that could make the game less interesting in the 1st edition and not much is lost functionally by replacing the map with Borough cards - although it is always quite nice to have a map.

The new card art is excellent although I think I still prefer the card backs from 1st ed - but this is a nice package from Osprey - 4 card sized player aids would have been nice though,

A very enjoyable core gameplay loop of developing and running your city... until you realize you're sending people into poverty for your own gain... London presents a fine balance between strategy and tactics, that feels considerably different at differing player counts. The classic multi-use card conundrum is here in spades, you want to play with all the colourful toys that are available, but will never be able to do everything you want in a single games. Ultimately, London is a fun but punishing ephemeral engine builder where an early mistep can certainly cost you the game.

This was a surprise hit. Very streamlined with a lot of good dilemmas/decisions. It is really no engine builder.

Wow, it's amazing what this game does with what is basically just a deck of cards. This engine building in the truest form, yet your engine is constantly falling apart and you are constantly building it. This makes the game interesting all game through.

I think this game looks amazing. I love the stark look of the box, board and cardbacks. But the art on the cards is also charming. The whole comes together very nicely without overdoing it. 

This is going straight into my top 10, I love it.

Solid card drafting and tableau building game.  Beautiful art and somewhat unique mechanics that really make you think about tactical efficiency... but the theme doesn't feel very strong and at times a bit of a distraction, when it seems like the theme is intended to be a driving force.  A vast majority of card mechanics and actions only feel remotely connected to the card's thematic elements, and many mechanics through the whole game really have more to do with creating a mechanically deliberate experience rather than creating thematic interaction/stories.

RATING: 6
Most of the changes are for the worse; the borough cards, combined with the nerfing of the card set take all of the pointy bits and sharp edges out of the game. 

Somewhere between the two versions is a pretty good game. Unfortunately, the first edition is closer to that game.

RATING: 8
Rated same as the base game.  "London 2nd edition" is virtually the same game except that it removes the map board and replaces them with location cards that pretty much do the same thing as the original map board except grant special effects just like normal cards. It actually works very well and while I don't have a preference of one over the other, I don't think anyone will miss the map board as the change makes London decidedly a card game.  Other little tweaks here and there make things a little simpler or more balanced.  The card art works well. Overall, this is a fine, new edition but doesn't replace the 1st edition at all. Either one will give you a great experience!

I didn't play the first edition, but I really, really like this new edition. It has some of the punishing economy of Martin Wallace's other games but with less rules overhead. This new edition is stunning, as well. The art looks great, and the whole package is just slick.

This is a punishing game, and it's hard to overcome early mistakes and poor play. But I really, really like this.

(A card glossary clarifying finer points would have been appreciated.)

RATING: 8.8
A very good game that could end up as a special title in my mind. I just have two reservations. The first is that poverty seems to be overly influential in this game such that if one player does everything they can to reduce their poverty to an extreme level, even if they haven't built an engine worth a damn, they may still win. In my first play, three players took -10, -13 and -19 points in poverty damage, which seems crippling. Second, experienced players will kill newbies at this game once they know the cards in the deck. This is probably not a negative so much as a warning for new players. Overall, this is a super elegant, really thinky, high quality production that I want to play more before my rating solidifies.

A card-game where you're building an engine, then running it and start to build a new one. Straight-forward to play because on your turn you have only four things you can do and you must pick one. This leads to agonizing decisions where usually you debate between building your engine one more turn versus just running it now. 

Aesthetics are beautiful, Osprey Games did a great job. Card stock quality is a little suspect so I recommend sleeving even if you're a savage that normally doesn't sleeve games. I have only played it with 4 players and I have a gut feeling it's even better with 3 or 2, because then you get to see more cards and have more control. (20.11.17)

London (Osprey v.2)  has some interesting twists to make the game better than v.1.  First, it is VERY hard to avoid Poverty, or even control it.  Second, the mapless districting makes Undergrounds fairer, and simpler to score.  But it doesn't lessen the flavour of the original despite the changes.

London makes me sad because it has really interesting mechanics, but in my opinion, the ending "C" deck is poorly designed and brings the whole game down.

For some reason I found the first edition too fiddly - the board with the boroughs too congested and the artwork less appealing than the magnificent cover illustration had led me to believe. This Osprey edition is completely different. The box is understated (but I like the way their game boxes open like books - Osprey is part of Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury). But inside the artwork is glorious. The game board is much simpler (almost unnecessary) and the boroughs are now individual oversized cards.  The gameplay itself seems streamlined (see Rodney Smith's excellent tuition video on the Geek). Having traded away the original I got this for just £23 on preorder from Blackwell's the bookshop. Congratulations to Osprey for rebooting this game so magnificently.

I love tableau / engine building games, but this one didn't exactly light my world on fire.  A perfectly fine game that I would happily play if it was someone else's copy, but not one I need to own.  Not particularly interested in the main focus of the game - which was managing your poverty compared to your opponents.  Engine building took more of a back seat so none of the cards were particularly 'fun' to play.  Wasn't ever going to be a game I wanted to play over and over.  

Hated how you were penalized for holding cards in your hand.  Made this much more tactical (and I love tactical) games, but it penalized / disincentived planning beyond your next turn or two.

It's a gorgeous game and I love the design of Osprey's boxes, along with how compact they are.  Unfortunately, that's not reason enough to own a game.

A major aesthetic upgrade to the original.  An approachable Martin Wallace game; what a concept!  Although I did have the best teacher outside of Martin himself (kudos to Rodney Smith!)  Elegant mechanics, with poverty being the prime dilemma to solve while (re)building your city.  Great fun, with nuanced strategy making its replayability factor quite high.  Looking forward to getting my own copy!

Completely ready to use this to teach business management, practical economics, and 19th century urban theory (and do not underestimate the importance of learning that right now; the zeitgeist is strong with this one).

It's very atmospheric, from the ominousness of black cubes to the point count boxes to the Romantic art, and once you're trapped in the system with your first loan, you really get a sense for how not like steampunk pre-Great War London was. There's more to the Victorian era than this, yes, but this has tight theme, the new look Osprey's putting on (read: wow), and succeeding takes serious strategy - and a realistic amount of selling yourself into cruelty.

So - if I'm teaching, I'm reaching for it. Might not pick it for a whimsical wine night with friends, except to look at the card art, but pedagogically, I'm all in.

...Also I secretly love trying to find ways to win games like this both in points AND in ethical choices. In that respect, this game is addictive and exhilaratingly difficult.

Great game with a lot of hard decisions on what cards to keep and what to discard for others to pick over.

The poverty aspect of the game creeps up on you and even when you think you are doing well with it, having  a couple of city runs where you actually decrease the poverty, means its all the harder when you take a load on. Keeping it balanced is one of the nice decisions you have to make in this game

My favorite game gets a re-release, so of course I had to buy it because I was interested to see the differences between the editions. The changes range from the cosmetic (additional artwork for cards, heartier card stock and no map of London) to the significant (you can repay a loan at the beginning of your turn, there are no poverty "deductions" for how many boroughs you buy, some boroughs have constant or one-time abilities). The heart and thrill of the original game is still apparent; managing a balanced display of cards that generate money, reduce poverty and earn you prestige. My only worry about the game is that a 2-player game can feel a tad long and unexciting. Maybe using the Ben-Luca variant (when wiping the card display, also trash a Borough card and then remove that many cards listed from the deck) can help solve this problem. I will report back!

Played three times 2er with Matt so far, and it far outshines the 1st edition, which was already quite a good game.  Replacing the fiddly map and ownership with tokens with borough cards containing special abilities is genius and much improves the flow of the game, and poverty management becomes a more significant factor now that boroughs no longer remove poverty during city runs and unpaid loans add poverty.

So to start off, I'm a HUGE fan of the first edition, so I was cautiously optimistic of this edition. Hearing they removed the board and replaced it with a deck of cards felt bizarre to me and potentially not something I wanted. Even though I realize it's a card game, the borough placement was fun, interesting, and provided extra strategy.

I was able to acquire this game at a very reasonable price shipped from the UK so I figured I'd give it a shot even if it might be redundant in the collection. Needless to say, I was super impressed with how similar yet completely different the game felt.

A few changes to the game really improved and provided different strategy that wasn't in the first edition. Boroughs no longer reduce poverty like they used to and loans now give you poverty. The struggle with poverty is much larger in this edition than the previous one. They also changed how the card display works, even if it is a minor change, it still feels different.

My only complaint about the game is that it can got a touch long with 2. I really think that there should have been cards to remove from the deck each game for that count. I'm not a huge fan of randomly removing cards, as I think knowing what's in the deck is critical even if you don't actually have a chance to buy/play the card due to an opponent taking the card.

Overall, I have to say I'm very impressed with this edition. It's different enough for me to warrant both in the collection, but if I was super picky, I would probably "upgrade" to this edition. What a great game that somehow got even better.

Loved the 1st edition.  Love the 2nd edition.  With this edition, money is tighter and poverty is much more important to track.  The economy just feels tighter. In a good way. I love maps in games and I miss the map a bit, but only for artistic reasons. It’s a very elegant game that I could always be willing to play even if I never win. Haha.

good game, clever, a little dry. probably rewards multiple plays, but i'm not sure i see that. feels more like multiple plays would end up multiple walking tour vacations of London where the players all know the landmarks but kinda wait to see who randomly spots them first. i think i'd rather own Race for the Galaxy, if i were worried about shelf space and portability and get-to-the-table-ability.

I liked the 1st edition but I love this 2nd edition. London works much better with only two players now. Boroughs are more interesting than ever, and now offer more meaningful strategic and tactical options. Play is much more dynamic in the 2nd edition, and it's now possible to change your strategic direction based on the shifting game environment. The borough arms race has been eliminated, and the acquisition of boroughs is now done to support and prepare for the Build Your City and Run Your City actions. The poverty mechanism was also revised and is now more thematic and impacting to the prestige point race. The management of poverty has evolved into another strategic element to be considered rather than just being a static drag to progress as it was handled in the 1st edition.

This is a fantastic fantastic game. Engine building at it's finest. I never played the original edition so I can't make a comparison, but they really knocked it out with this version. Beautiful artwork, amazing card quality, and the box opens like a book. I love how the poverty system works, it's a really smart mechanism. It's all relative to your opponent with the lowest amount. So, this enhances the player awareness big time. you need to be constantly observing the competition throughout the game. I love the synergies btw cards, and the timing involved in playing well. London may become a 10 for me if it keeps it's pace in subsequent plays. Two thumbs way up!

At last! Wallace (or somebody) finally got round to finishing developing London. I enjoyed the original a lot, but the board was clearly a hangover from earlier iterations - location cards in this edition work much more interstingly. I prefer 1e art and design, but the art isn’t bad at all on this and perhaps the design is better - it’s comparable, anyway.

Once again, Wallace's 2nd edition comes out better than the first edition.  The elimination of the city board and making the boroughs abstract is great and eliminating them reducing poverty on every city run makes the game much better and makes poverty more significant.  I always enjoyed the original, but this version has surpassed it for me.

Definitely a big improvement over the first edition. The new borough cards and complete removal of the map were a fantastic idea - the designer got rid of the most boring part of the game. I love the whole "card circulation system" in London - it's a great puzzle. I wish there was more variety in the cards though, their abilities feel a bit samey (but that's a minor complaint really).

By the way, the second edition looks absolutely gorgeous, it's a stellar production.

/update: After third play of this I seem to enjoy it more and more. The gameplay got faster and more dynamic. London is a really good couple's game. The poverty mechanism is challenging, but it's very satisfying when you manage to overcome it. 

/another update: I've tried a few pretty crazy and risky strategies and they all paid off - maybe there's more strategy to this game than I initially thought. I'm very surprised (in a positive way). I really enjoy this game right now. Highly recommended!

Very light game, similar to Ticket to Ride, but for 2 players. Very good introductory game too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
1st play: I spent the majority of the first play off balance. I got behind early on by locking up a bunch of my colors in the wrong color and my opponent played around this well, leaving me struggling to get any motion. The game is very attractive on the table and builds in a nice three dimensional way. It feels like there's a fair amount of randomness in terms of the colors of cards you drawn, and a lot of the game is dictated by this.

2nd play: Building on what I learned in the first play, I did exactly the same thing that happened to me to my opponent. I spent the entire game almost building exclusively in green and yellow, while my opponent was showing purple and blue. As a result, he was barely moving and I was spending 6-7 cards per turn. Once ahead, you have special powers and added flexibility options. This made it feel like a runaway leader problem, but in a game that lasts 20-30 minutes, that isn't the killer that it is in a longer game.

RATING: 6.98
Decent two player game, though if someone lets someone else have a good play it is really easy to get behind and have them run away with the score. Evenly matched players may be within a few points of each other the entire game, the winner taking the final lead by only a few.

The decisions in the game are quite tactical and not particularly deep (Only so much you can explore decision-wise)... but I wouldn't say the decisions are simplistic. The hand-management and combo system creates a very dynamic and interesting game that should hold the attention of most gamers. It really fits the stereotype of a "couple's game." I did find the game-play a bit fiddly... especially with how quick each player's turn is. But overall, I enjoyed this game quite a bit. 

[6/22/15] Rating lowered from 7 to 5. While I don't want to suggest the game plays itself (it doesn't) many of the "decisions" are more products of opportunity. Furthermore, the tension created in the game stems from a push-your-luck element where you hope your opponent can't capitalize from your actions. I still think the game is visually attractive and many family gamers will enjoy this title. But, the wow-factor didn't remain with multiple plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I did not get any excited.  The idea looks quite good, but for some reason it did not click on me.  Using color cards you put colums and roofs in the pagodas, getting more points as the columns are in higher levels.  Roofs activate powers.
Probably it is just not for me, somehow I think there is a good game here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed seeing the pagodas built from scratch. I think AEG did well with the use of the 5 colors and the tiles to create the visually appealing effect.

The special powers after laying of each floor is really good too. Plus it is color coded so it is easier to remember.

Furthermore, the play was fast and not draggy with very little down time since you are planning while your opponent is making his/her move. Looking forward to more plays.

 You are playing cards to a board in order to build columns and Pagodas which give you points based on the floor that you built them on. Special abilities are granted for the different colored Pagodas. 

There is nothing incredibly special about this title and it seemed like luck could play a deciding factor; although somewhat mitigable. Some nice combos; nothing exciting or to write home about.

Quite a pretty little abstract game. It does devolve a little bit into how many of my cards can I play this round, rather than anything more tactical. 

The addition of adding a floor giving you a special ability is nice but some are strictly better than others I feel,(drawing plus 2 cards) but each is useful in its own way, and the scores were very close at the end, although we both felt it went on maybe a turn or two too longer when one player have very limited options and the second player was in the winning position but couldn't [i]quite[/i] finish the game.

Simple enough that I could probably play this with the daughter, looking forward to her next visit and getting this back to the table

RATING: 7
Pagoda is quite nice, actually. The pace is a little slowed by the crucial monitoring of your opponent's cards and calculating when the use of the special actions makes the most sense. With that in mind, it is still a rather snappy little 2-player game with a nice presentation and a good "push your luck" mechanic (a mechanic I often enjoy). The game is designed to keep both players neck-and-neck for points. The interesting thing is knowing when and where to squeeze just a few extra points out of the game to win it. Not mind blowing or one of my favourite 2p games, but certainly a keeper.

RATING: 7
From low expectations, this wowed me with how subtle some of the design is. The fact that most of your hand is public turns out to be an unusual hook.

It's basically a starvation game-- the increasing value of adding to a pagoda as it gets taller means that you're often more concerned with not giving your opponent a good opportunity than you are with getting points yourself, but you have to lunge for a high-scoring turn when you can.

Aside from the mostly-open hands, the mechanics aren't particularly new or interesting. But for its niche (simple one-hour gamer's games) it stands out.

A 8+-os korosztályos besorolás már jelzi, hogy ez egy nagyon könnyed kétszemélyes játék. A játékban pagodákat kell építeni, oly módon, hogy négy oszlop és egy tetőből áll egy szint, és a teljes pagodához kell négy tető, plusz a csúcs. 5 színű kártya van az 5 fajta pagodához. 

Előttünk 5 kártya van nyíltan, és kettő a kezünkbe. Egy kártyával egy oszlopot tudunk felrakni és ha felraktuk mind a 4-et, akkor egy olyan színűvel tudjuk az emeletet rárakni, amely meghatározza a következő szint oszlopainak színét ráadásul kapunk a színnek megfelelő bónuszt, amelyet későbbi játékban tudunk kihasználni. Természetesen minél magasabb szinten építkezünk annál több pontot kapunk. A játék addig tart, míg 3 pagoda fel nem épült. 

A játék szép kivitelű, a pagodák nagyon jól néznek ki. Egyszerűsége miatt gyerekekkel is könnyen játszható.

As 2 player games go, this is just okay.  Visually, it is quite striking watching those pagodas rise up.  However, the game as a whole has just kinda fallen flat wherever I've introduced it.  I found the rules about when to place pieces, build the roof, and put the piece of top to be less than straightforward.  I actually regret buying it, which doesn't happen often.  

I'd recommend you go look at some other great 2 player games, there's so much to choose from.  This is not a necessary addition to your collection as far as I'm concerned.  Meh for me.

RATING: 7
A two player game that looks fantastic on the table and I have found to be great fun to play with kids and adults alike.

On your go you play cards from your hand to build pillars or floors of the pagodas in front of you. Each pagoda is four stories high and each story can only be built by the colour pillars depicted on the that levels floor tile. If you build the floor tile you get to choose the colours required for the next levels pillars. Your hand is comprised of open cards on the table face up and hidden cards in your hand. So you can choose a pillar colour you don't think your opponent will be able to build ... but you can never be completely sure. Also when you build a floor level you get a special two shot ability on your player board. Each colour refers to a different special ability , whether it be more cards in your hand, build an extra pillar or substitute colours when building.

Here's a picture to save me a thousand words!




It is a very tight game. Scores, I have found, are normally very close and it is through the manipulation of these special abilities that the game is won and lost. The abilities are a little bit Animal Farm (meant to be equal but in reality two legs is better than four). After several plays some, I feel, are definitely better than others. 

This is a good game and one that we bring out and enjoy enough to keep it around.

UPDATE

Still one of my favourite coffee games. Many people have commented that this is just an exercise in efficiency and to a certain extent I had previously agreed with that. Scores had always been fairly close and I really didn't mind that, sometimes a game like that is good. But this game blew that opinion out of the water. It was the most open game I have had of it. The scoring for some reason varied wildly and I found myself about 15 points ahead by mid game but lost it by over 20 points by the end. I had never experienced anything like it with Pagoda before and I like the game even more for it.

Another under rated coffee gaming gem!

Tactical 2 player with luck of the draw. Well, that sounds a bit dull, and it's not a special game, but it's quite ok. Gamelength is goed for what it is, game keeps your brains active. Had a good time playin' it. I rated it tentatively a bit low after my first play because I'm not sure about the replayability factor. Right now I think I'll only play it a couple of times (hence the fairly low rating), but I might be wrong.

Good 2-player game.  It's a bit lighter than I'd prefer, but it wins out due to it's fun theme, colorful components, and the actual building of the pagodas.

It's a great couple's game, and while it will stay in my collection for a long time, it's one I'll prefer to play after breaks because each game is very similar.

Edit: Eventually sold it.  It's hard to part with such a colorful little game, but it's a bit too samey after so many plays.

Good, solid game, all present and correct and nothing to complain about.  If I wanted a larger collection then this would definitely be part of it, but it just didn't grab us as much as some other games to make us convinced it would ever find its way back to the table.  For gentle, slightly obstructive head-to-headness, though, this is well worth a try.

This is essentially a 2-player abstract strategy game, but it has a nice theme/design combined with luck of the draw that is mitigated by some special powers that can be unlocked.

The components are nice and the visual aspect of the game is its main attractive feature.

There's an abstract game at its core, with simple rules and fast and fluid gameplay. 

It's much lighter than I expected. You're supposed to think and act in order to negate points to your opponent, but most of the times you'll go for the straightforward option because even if you forfeit points not to set up your opponent, he can have the card he needs in his secret 2-card hand and win the points you tried to deny him.

At the end, the gameplay is very straightfoward with the occasional "meaty" decision about when to use a special power.

Really excellent game. Simple rules. Tough decisions every turn. It's a game where you're always trying to set yourself up for a big scoring play, being careful not to inadvertently do the same for your opponent. My 10 y/o and I played our first game in an hour, including punching and rules reading. So, it plays fast. And it's beautiful on the table at game end.

[b]Pagoda[/b] was traded away in a math trade 2/7/15. (Received 10 Days in Africa)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I really liked my initial plays of this game and I thought it was a beautifully produced game. However; after a few more plays it became apparent that you could really get behind the 8 ball in this game if you got poor card draws and couldn't complete floors to get the bonus abilities. I played too many games were one person got the cards to complete purple floors and therefore could have a bigger hand size; this lead to that person pulling further ahead because they had a better chance of getting the colors they needed. 

In the end that sucked a lot of fun out of the game, because it left one player feeling like they didn't have a chance from the beginning. In the end Pagoda had some very interesting mechanisms, but we encountered a serious runaway leader problem.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Another great 2p game I can play with my wife.
- Also a great game to play with your kids.
- Beautiful components. The game looks amazing as you build and eventually complete building the pagodas.
- Simple game play expanded upon by the special actions you can earn for finishing floors of a pagoda.
- Special actions: this is were games are won or loss, the abilities aren't game breaking, but they let you do a little extra on your turn which helps you earn a few more points.
- So far our games have mostly been close, thus the game remains tense as you play.[/i]

This feels like a nice spouse game. There's no hitty-hitty, it's just playing out your cards in a Ticket To Ride kind of way, hoping the cards fall your way each turn to be able to max your points. Capping each level with a pagoda tile earns you a special power - scrap cards, get more cards, use doubles as wilds, etc - and using these at the right moments make for the decision making. Otherwise, the game is straight-forward and non-taxing, score what points what you can and get special powers, while minimising the chances for your opponent to get special powers - each player having 5 of their 7 cards visible is a nice touch here to allow that. There's luck in getting the cards you need to score on the highest level at the right time ... but you can also earn the right to minimise that luck by earning powers and saving them / using them at the right time. All in all it's a solid 2 player family type game.

An Elegant Light-Med-Weight 2-Player 3-D-ish Abstract Hand-Management Game About Building Pagodas. Plays in 25 to 45 minutes. Easy to teach. Good production. Eye-catching. Very pleasant play. Of Kosmos caliber. Not a brain-burner abstract.

2-Player Game! Casual Game!

I wonder if there'll be a Godzilla expansion.  :laugh:

My wife and I love this game so much it's excellent arrived with me the same week as Istanbul, and Port Royal ...to be honest all three games from this publisher suffer from the same problem ...

They are all great fun, good solid games with excellent production ...

This game is the only dedicated two player of the three however the other two scale down to two player very well ...

Reminds me somewhat of the two player Kosmos series style game when they were at their zenith ...

Lite rules...loads of decision making but not subject to AP ...

I was a little worried about how well the pagodas would stand up once fully built and to be honest if you have short stubby fingers it can be a tiny bit tricky but actually they held up really well ...more rules than Port Royal but less than Istanbul all three games are fairly quick playing ...Part royal being more of a filler and Istandbul being a bit longer to play than this at two player but that's mainly because it is a longer game with more actions and decisions needed ...

Well done PS for these wonderful three games ...we love them all

A fun two player game that my wife and I enjoy. There are enough meaningful decisions to make it interesting and the special powers adds some extra strategy on top. Plus, it is just fun to build up the colorful towers!

Why is the box for the game so big? It's a 2 player game, the box could probably be half the size. In any case, Pagoda is another nice, relaxing game that's fun to play with a loved one. I like the special powers for building pagodas, but I feel like it's difficult to really get one up on your opponent. The scores at the end are usually very close. In any case though, it is a nice game. The components are very nice, and by the time you finish, you've built these little pagodas on the board, and they look cool.

Jogo simples e algo estranho, com alto teor de parasitismo mas que acaba por não ser clara a sua intervenção na pontuação final, pois o rácio habilidade/pontos não me convence... As peças deviam ser maiores, para os pagodes impressionarem visualmente. Gosto mais de jogar com habilidades.

I was so on the fence about getting this game. Turns out I made the right choice. I was afraid it might be too abstract, and perhaps it is abstract but building the pagodas is fun. Interesting choices to be made and the special abilities add a bit of flavor. If the game interests you I would suggest getting it.

08-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. Pagoda is an interesting game for 2 players. In the game you are building pagoda's, by playing cards of a cards of the color of the pagoda floor you are building onto. Admitttedly, I played the ame a LONG time ago compared to when I now write this comment and I forgot most about it. I think that reflects my opinion though, it was ok, but ultimately forgettable.

Played this underrated, peaceful AEG 2P 3D building game a few times now with my daughter and wife. The Emperor of China has planned a visit to your village and you and another architect compete to impress him with your design and building prowess. It has elements of TTR, color set collection & VPs for construction and finishes in under 45m. I wish there were some more scoring opportunities, but otherwise it is a really fun game. It's pretty light, there definitely needs to be a few more things you can work for end game scoring otherwise the winner is usually a foredrawn conclusion while the third tower is being constructed. It does have a nice zen feel for when you're in the mood for a 2P game that's not too attacky. I might house rule a few end game bonuses based upon column colors used or spires matching a card assigned at the onset to add some extra drama.

I can see that Pagoda has some charm and when two players are playing a close game, I suspect it can be a pretty tense, interesting experience. Unfortunately, in my first game of it, one player got an early roof and used the special ability it granted, to run away with the game, leaving the other player (me) with limited to no options each turn. This may well have been in part due to experience in the game and the value of the roofs, but simply because of the luck of the draw, I'm unsure what I actually could have done differently (including spending at least 1 turn playing 4 cards as any one). In many turns, there were actually no playable colours at all. It all felt very frustrating and not at all fun.

Very impressed after a couple of plays. This game gives me a similar feel of Jaipur, but unlike Morels (to which Jaupur is rightly often compared), the gameplay here is completely different.

Being able to see all of your opponent's cards except for two is a really clever idea. You can play according to what cards your opponent has, but you can't quite make perfect moves because they can surprise you with the two secret cards in hand.

You also gain special abilities for building the Pagoda tiles. The abilities are simple, allowing you to draw extra cards or play cards that you wouldn't normally be able to play, but they really add a nice strategic layer to the game and help mitigate the luck of the card draw.

On a superficial level, there's just something about games that let you physically build things. Sure your're just stacking common board game pieces on top of other common pieces, but it somehow feels rewarding to build a nice colorful Pagoda with it's own little rooftop.

Very good two-player game is very simple but leaves room for lots of tactical, clever moves.

PROS: •A very fun game, well-constructed ruleset and great gameplay flow overall; •The open information and special powers bring a lot of decision-making to the gameplay, and this mitigates the luck of the draw; •There is a bit of timing involved - but not too much, so it doesn't become heavy - in order to score the most points while not leaving the table in a favorable situation to your opponent; •Small cards for small amounts of information - I hate when a game uses bridge or poker sized cards to depict simple things such as colours and symbols, and this game does not make this mistake.

CONS: •The tiles and pieces stack in dangerous ways - You really need to be careful in order not to ruin everything, physically. •The box is way bigger than needed, just because of the board. Make it fold a few more times and the box size could be massively reduced.

I don't play a lot of two-player only games, but I really like this one. You get to build pagodas with tiles and wooden columns, strategically making your moves so that you don't set up your opponent for big plays and big points. The special abilities you get when you play the floor tiles are really cool, and deciding when to use them makes for a very interesting game.

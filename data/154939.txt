GAME: MERCS: Recon – Counter Threat
RANK: 4256
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Interesting ideas with darn good potential for widely varied games. Unfortunately Mercs original rules writer has written this game as well. The result is lack of organization, missing information, and general confusion. Our first game involved so many rules checks that we came close to giving up repeatedly. 
The room and hall tiles are a good idea as they are locked in place by a border thus eliminating the need for making all the tiles interlock. The downside is that the tiles need to be arranged carefully and impartially so the objective spaces are far enough away from the  Mercs' insertion point to create a balanced scenario.

liked it very much, a playable action movie. the rules could use a good FAQ, but it is fully playable. these kind of games tend to have some holes in the rules

This game looks good on the table, after the minis are assembled and painted (relatively easy though you need to download instructions from the website). The system is sound and fun to play, though there are still a couple of holes in the rules. It also works exceptionally well in solitaire mode.

RATING: 7
Just like Myth, this is imaginative and unlike anything else on the market.  Just like Myth, it has inconsistencies in rules and printed materials and requires the user make some adjustments on the fly.  The rulebook is definitely better than Myth here, but it's still far from complete.  

The game itself can also be wonky with a hallway being completely destroyed and then you can't complete the mission.  Or you can be sailing along smoothly and get to the Breach and Clear mini game to complete the mission and just get destroyed in this sub-system dice game.  I actually really like the B&C mini game but it can certainly rub people the wrong way.  

The game's all about creating really interesting narratives with unique mechanisms but sometimes the situation turns ugly and the game will let you screw yourself over.

Challenging and varied game play and missions make this very enjoyable. 4 MERCS teams. Dozens of missions. All play differently. You'll never play the same game twice. Thankfully no major rules issues this time round. (Deducted .5 due to some slight component issues, plus not being able to get all the KS stretch goals and the module boxes even 6 months after its original shipping date.)

Very fun tactical shooter with lots of creeping around early and lots of blowing stuff up late. What is better than that? I love this game system. The diversity of squads to employ keeps it interesting, and no two games turn out the same, yet.

2 games in 1. Everything you need to play Mercs Recon and Mercs 2.0
Comes with 2 full 10 men teams (extra 5 per faction) and comes with Mercs 2.0 rule book.

RATING: 5
Good value for what's in the box (some tile warpage notwithstanding)--if you were so inclined you could use the minis for the MERCS minis game--but I think I'm done with MegaCon after this. To a certain extent, it's not their fault that Gears of War (and, to a lesser extent, the D&D games) got the formula so damn right so early. It is their fault, though, that the rules are a bit of a mess with some glaring omissions and some serious wonkiness. How can you get away with not explicitly saying you bring five MERCS regardless of the number of players? Come on, guys.
The new thing, Breach and Clear, is also poorly explained, especially since it's almost 100% a dice-off with no real choices. Past that, it's a pretty standard affair; the novel stuff is either largely irrelevant (interrogation) or serves largely to frustrate ease of play (destructible environments).
[EDIT] This game is close to being good, perhaps even great. Here's what it would have needed:
-A better rulebook (mostly addressed)
-Choices during Breach and Clear
-A reason to care about priority (I mean, tying priority increases to security level is an obvious and much-needed element)
-Not to fix the number of MERCS at a prime number. This is huge. There's no number of players at which this division works except solo or five players.
-More structured missions. Seriously, guys, this isn't a minis game, and even in a minis game these scenario instructions would be inadequate; for a board game they're bordering on pointless. Mix up objective tiles and put them in "named rooms"? Seriously? Any of them?

So, so, so disappointed.  Rules are lacking. Game play has me scratching my head sometimes. Components that you just want to be better than what is delivered.  I really wanted to like this game.

Don't understand why game includes some, but not all, of the miniatures for the security force (go big or go home).  Miniatures are similar to those from Sedition Wars wave 2 - a very slick plastic that is shrunk down from the original (metal) sculpts.  Soft on detail and unimpressive.

Game is fiddly and capricious in play.  Found myself looking forward to doing something else.  Extremely disappointed with this release.

mediocre components and game feels rushed. If you manage to struggle through the rulebook the game isn't bad. But I got the feeling that it hadn't been playtested enough. I think that the main purpose of the KS was to create the minis in plastic and the game was just a means to make it possible. But not enough attention was put into the game itself. And the minis are not boardgame freindly (assembly and cleaning required!) nor are they tabletop quality.
I painted the entire box and sold it of.

Board not as customizable as they would have you believe without forking out for all of the expansions which offer incremental changes to the board and largely introduce new teams and missions, not really growing the experience. Glad i stuck to just the core game, but it is a fun game solo,

I'm quite disappointed with this game.  The rules explanations are not clear and seem to have had insufficient QA.  There are many things that are just left up to the players to make up as they go, which to me is lazy design rather than proper customisation.  I would also say that the base game (if you don't have any of the extra components, such as from kickstarter), is incomplete.  In any given game, you are likely to encounter security forces of levels 1 - 4.  However, there are only miniatures for for levels 2 and 3.  For levels 1 - 3 there are also tokens which can be used.  For level 4 units, you are supposed to use the spare minis from the other team.  Too bad if you ever have more than 5 level 4 enemies at once...  This could have easily been dealt with by just having some extra tokens for each level of enemy.  Mission cards are also not especially clear.

Probably my favorite board game thus far.  Make no mistake:  It has its faults and isn't perfect by any means (some wonky rules that are incomplete in some areas), but with some research and house rules, it is very fun.  Die-hard table top war gamers may take issue with the aesthetics of the components, but for somebody like me who purchased almost everything in the RECON series who is in it for the board game, this doesn't matter.

This game is not for everybody, so I suggest you try before you buy.  But if you're looking for a good board game that features minis and is modern-day themed, then give MERCS: Recon a whirl.

Great theme, and as always I love Keith's art. Lots of folks complaining about component quality, but my copy is not that bad and I'm ok with it. The gameplay is addictive and keeps you coming back for more, there is definitely an intensity to the pace and you never really know if you're winning until the very end.

I have enjoyed the game. It is a fun cooperative game and it is hard. The game design is good but some rules are lacking. The components could have been better but this is due to production in China. They just chose the wrong factory to produce this. Maybe production be better in future prints. Overall the game is fun and planning to play as much as I can. It would have gotten a 10 but due to production quality.

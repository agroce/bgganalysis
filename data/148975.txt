Excellent little thinky game with nice interaction, nice feel and nice evolution as you play through. There's plenty of options and it is genuinely exciting when the dungeon cards are flipped over.

地城聯盟：
萌萌小冒險者們在地城裡橫衝直撞...
做為在背後運籌帷幄的會長們，
不只要讓自己的冒險者們完成任務，
還要想辦法讓其他玩家的任務失敗。
勾心鬥角爾虞我詐的合作，由此而生

地城聯盟算是個工人放置遊戲，
但是放下去的人有可能會被踢掉...
任務也不一定能執行成功就是...

但是玩法和遊戲背景的契合度很低...
有點可惜討喜的美術與冒險者主題。

Fun little dundeon crawling themed card game with a little push your luck mechanic. Not a huge fan of the art style.

Short card game with some basic tactical decisions to make. I liked the game and the mechanic, but the whole anime thing just doesn't interest me.

Fun way to play, everyone starts with 20 coins, but all cards are face-down, so you have to guess what others are playing.

It becomes a paranoid struggle wondering if your opponents are setting the bottom of the dungeon up for failure, or actually trying to score coins.

Neat little game, with a fraction more depth than was apparant at first glance.  Cutesy-anime illustrations aren't a highlight, though.

A Korean game with a reasonable buzz about it after Tom Vassel gave it a rave review.  It is a sort of push your luck game in that you are effectively bidding on the values of a number of face down cards.    You can push other people out of the bid by paying them.  Eventually each player makes two bids and each card has two bids on it.  On the reveal of the cards the interesting aspect is that you resolve from the top down, and if the total bid on any card does not reach the required level the rest of the cards below that one are bust.  So you get an interesting situation where, if you bid on the more valuable cards towards the bottom, you really need the cards above it to be successful or your bid is worthless.  It is kind of clever and the reveal is always entertaining.  And it plays in 30 minutes.

I try not to have multiple games for each "game night role," but I broke my policy a little bit with this one. I already own Love Letter, and in one sense this is similar:  very lightweight, fast, and small. But it supports up to six players and it has a very different vibe. It's a card game, but it's more about auctioning or even worker placement, where Love Letter is more about deduction. So far Dungeon Guilds is a delightful game though, and I can't wait to play it some more.

RATING: 7
Cool little fantasy dungeon theme game where you are working with other adventure to defeat monsters and collect the most loot.

There is some interesting non direct take that elements when you try to sabotage the people in the higher dungeons or position yourself by bumping people.

Only issue is that it really shines with 5 because of the other person out otherwise it can degrade into "teams" of people consistently working together.

I had good fun with this, although I only played with three players so far. I can imagine increasing my rating if I played with more. I find it very interactive, with lots of clever options and possibilities to screw other people over.

After a second play with only three players, I'd recommend playing with at least 4 or going 6 rounds with three players.  

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Fun filler where players are fighting unknown opponents but know the range of strength which is needed to conquer potential opponents.  Everyone keeps placing a warrior (numbered with strength values 1-5) until they've placed two and then you pass unless one of your warriors got kicked out by a higher value warrior.  The kicker is that you must conquer rooms top to bottom and once a room fails, all rooms below fail to be conquered no matter the beast waiting and then one must pay money for healing their warriors.  Most money wins at the end of the game. 

FYI, the artwork of the anime warriors are of women and the card art goes from fully garbed like a nun and no weapon for value 1 cards to some bikini garbed warriors with a huge sword for value 5 cards in case that is of concern to you.  There are pictures on the geek of the full card sets of warriors.

Ein Spiel mit Abbildungen von leicht bekleideten Mädchen…
Von seinen 5 Handkarten hat man pro Runde 3 zur Verfügung und wählt darasus 2 um sie an Dungeonkarten in die Mitte zu legen. Sobald alle Spieler 2 Karten angelegt haben, wird der Dungeon Stück für Stück aufgedeckt und nachgeschaut ob die Stärke der Helden ausreicht um das Monster zu besiegen. Wenn ja, erhalten diese Schätze, wenn nein scheitern ALLE restlichen Helden, auch die, die noch nicht dran waren.
Sehr leichtes und sehr schnelles Spiel. Die Grafik ist sehr hübsch und nicht anzüglich!
Durch verdrengen anderer Helden oder durch das absichtliche Scheitern lassen hat man auch genug Einfluss auf das Spiel.

Dungeon crawl with push your luck and point control, cutesy (slightly disturbing) anime artwork on the cards.  Mechanics sufficiently solid to be enjoyable enough, but nothing special and the theme/art really didn't grab me.

A clever push your luck style dungeon delving game where players need to cooperate to get the better treasures, But sometimes it may be more useful to stop anyone reaching them!

Chibi art is somewhat cutesy, somewhat creepy, but doesn't distract too much.

Cute little chibi ninja dungeon crawler filler. Has a very clever and engaging method of screwage, which may not be evident if players tend to avoid confrontation. Top notch illustration, even though the promo cards do not match the quality.

Love the dungeon crawler theme. 

I wouldn't really call this a worker placement game, it's more of a card game with an optimization puzzle built into it. You have figure out which cards are best to play, and in which order, depending on the turn order and the cards your opponents have left. Surprising amount of mathy depth for a small box.

It's more fun that it looks.  There are plenty of opportunities for tactics in the placement of cards.  Depending on which cards you choose, you can really mess with other players' plans.

Simple press your luck cardgame with some bluffing and some randomness. Just interesting and unique enough to keep in my collection, even if only for occasional play. The idea of the dungeon levels and bosses certainly appeals to me. Artwork is allright-ish if you like manga inspired artwork (like me).

Like: The game flow and the tension between players.

Dislike: Theme turns some people off. Needs a few plays to fully understand, very easy to lose or win without realizing what happened.

Dungeon Guild's rating is likely to increase as soon as I play it with five or six players. With four it doesn't allow for a lot of clever play, and you may end up clearing entire dungeons. I still hold out hope...

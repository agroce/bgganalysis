Simple and silly-cute themed auction game. Each person puts down one card from their hand to form a lot that everyone bids on. Each time someone drops out of the bid, they are paid an increasing amount of money/points and one more card from the bid lot is revealed. There are cat cards that are worth positive or negative points, dog cards that can chase away cat cards [the positive or negative, depending on the dog type], and a bunny card which is worth 0 and immune to the dog-chasing effects.

I would have rated this higher after one play, but upon playing it several more times my rating went down.  This is due to not having nearly as much control as you first think you do.  It appears to give you choices, but it's fairly random what you end up with in the end.  Cute theme and somewhat fun to play tho, but no lasting appeal.  For Sale is much better, by comparison.

RATING: 7
It's a bit of a cross between Nobody Here But Us Chickens and Geschenkt.  TBH, it's not as good as either of them, lacking as it does the simplicity of the former and the elegance and bite of the latter.  Having said that, I'm glad that I bought the game and it will get play as an end of night filler or as a family game with the kids.  The art work is lovely and the cards are great to hold in the hand - large and thickly cut.  So, it's fun , fairly easy and colourful...but it does have rivals in the simple-but-interesting card game genre.

It makes a big difference to bidding and play where you put the cat in the sack card.  We prefer to put it onto the right hand side and thus pay out 2 for the fist person to pass.  This also means that the last one in HAS to pay up and can't pass for 6 mice.  To our minds this makes for a quicker bidding process and an edgier game.

Looks like a cute auction game but not a lot of money flowing in the system, it's easy for the cards on auction to be valuable enough to screw your own position for future rounds because you spent all of your cash or you let someone get a bargain. Great fun when the build up reverses and someone pays 10 for something worth - 10.

It was a good time to play.  Nice auction game.  Not as simple as No Thanks!, but in the same vein.

Update: The more I play it, the more poker-y it becomes.  Bluffing, enticing others, knowing when to fold.  Moderately favors those who can count cards (not me at all).

Wonderful cards. Shades of Geschenkt.. and For Sale, but this one offers less control over the proceedings. The dummy player for the three player rules would probably have been a good addition for other player numbers too.

RATING: 8.6
Exquisite psychological brinksmanship, with a very high level of uncertainty. I tend not to like auction games, but this one is the cat's meow!
My only complaint with the game is the mice, i.e, the bidding chips. They don't resemble mice at all. They're chips. I would have been quite happy if the rules had said, "To bid, place a chip in front of you." But to call them "mice" is a thematic stretch that would even shock Dr. Knizia.

RATING: 6.8
A very fun filler game that can be called completely without luck.  The reason for this is that each player starts out with the same 10 cards and places the cards and places one of their cards in the middle.  Then each person bids/bluffs and finally all 4 cards are auctioned off.  I think this game was a lot of fun, and more time will have to be added to discover more strategic depth.

This one went on a run of play in my local group which I had missed, and I finally played it many months later.  Pretty disappointed, really.  Blowing myself more or less out of the game on round one may influence things, but I don't think that much because I still observed the subsequent decisions that others were better able to make because of liquidity.  It sounded like For Sale with fun, but I think it's too short on control to be enjoyable.  Maybe a few twists and turns on it and it would be a great bluffing game, but I think it has either too few or too many layers for that.

RATING: 6
Players bid on initial card.  When a player drops out they turn over the next card so that the remaining players have more information.  This can cut both ways, giving a significant luck element.  But this is not out of keeping for such a light game.  Be warned though, if you over bid in the early rounds you can be cashless for the rest of the game which is no fun at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
A filler that packs a punch. Small box, and just a few cards and tokens. Whoever is last usually has an edge because his card is last and he has a good chance of buying, but when a player buys the row he's the first play so that edge is lost, and thus creates a nice balance.
Artwork and the big sized cards help the experience of the game.

Nekem ez a játék For Sale-lel egyenlő szintű. Kicsit hasonló a licit menete, de ez kicsit bonyolultabb. A kutyák nagyon feldobják a játékot, és jó ötlet az is, hogy az egyik lapunk random kiesik az elején. A játék egyetlen hátrányának azt érzem, hogy nagyon nem mindegy, hol ülünk, ebből a szempontból nincs kiegyenlítve a játék: ha egy harcias licitmániás jobbján ülünk, akkor sokszor kerülünk kedvező pozícióba, ezáltal előnybe kerülünk. De egy ilyen könnyed játéknál ez igazán elnézhető...

Funny little auction game in which you try too outsmart your oponents by getting them to bid on bad cards while you try to get to the good ones. The bidding mechanism together with the expanding but still limited information make for a solid filler which has a good take that factor.

An excellent filler-style auction game.  I like how you have some information, but not all the information about what you are bidding on.  It has much more strategy than you may initially suspect, and plays in a short amount of time.  I love those moments where you are struggling to figure out whether your opponent is bidding you up just to force you to pay more, or whether they played some high point card.

I love everything about this game.  There are moments where you will bid up other players just to get a bigger benefit from passing and they will all drop out and force you to pay up.  Then there are moments where you know that last card you played is going to hurt whoever wins the auction, but you hang in just to bluff them out of some big money.  Sometimes it can seem totally arbitrary what card to play in a round, but with more experience you start to get some strategies (holding back your high point cards until you can afford to pay for them.)

Felix is an annoying filler I have been induced to play a couple of times by a good friend o’ mine who happens to be a cat lover: I didn’t find it fun by any means but I reckon the game’s faintly hinted theme appeals any cat owner.

To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when you walk around.  That way, if anybody says "Hey, can you give me a hand?" you can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."

I really like this game!  It can be frustrating when other players are pursuing different goals than you, so some rounds feel pretty random.  But the momentum swings from a really good pot and a really bad pot make for fun times with lots of laughter.  Great lunch game!  (I wish the rulebook was a little better.  The rules are not complicated, but it needed a few clarifications: Dogs chase bunnies as well as cats, etc.)

My friends like to call this game THE filler for gamers. To do well in it, you need to be aware of other players' position, money, and cards left. Whoever bluffs best and takes risks at the right time will probably win. In fact, winning one or two good tricks is usually enough to win the game. This filler packs a good dose of fun in a short time. Best with 5 players.

It's enjoyable watching other players draw all sorts of bad cards and then pay a ton for them.  Hehehe.  One problem with this game is that if you fall under about 10 bucks, it's almost impossible to keep in the game, because you will be outbid in the first round every single time for the rest of the game.  If I were the designer, I'd shift the 2 coins down to the first level, and then add 8 coins total on the 4th card.  I rate it six paws.

Nice addition to the quick card game genre. Being early in the turn order is often out of your control and not a good position. There's just not enough information to work with. I also feel that passing is just too strong an option. I am confident that I could have won without ever winning a bid. Not sure that is such a great thing. The object of the game is really to finish 2nd in every auction. That is kind of interesting, but something just feels out of whack about that. It's strangely tension-free. For Sale is superior in every way.

Well... There really wasn’t a lot of strategy in this game! It was mostly about bluffing and being lucky. Yet I somehow still managed to win both of my games, so obviously there must be a little bit of strategy involved, hehe...  

What I liked most about the game was when you were last or second to last in turn order because you have access to a lot of information the other players don’t! So you might try to bluff and increase the bid even though you can see that the sack of cats will be bad – but your opponent doesn’t know this, he only know that you know what the last or second to last card is, so he might increase his bid. Or, of course, you might just increase your bid because your card is actually a very good one! 

I liked the dog cards and how they remove cats – or even remove themselves as they play with each other! The negatives cats is a great twist too, but the dogs are definitely what causes the tension in the game, especially when a 15-cat is revealed and then a big dog… Is the next card going to be yet a dog so the sack actually becomes quite valuable?! One thing I noticed in our two games was that you actually scored a significant amount of points on the mice chips; I think this is a minor flaw in the game as you should be encouraged to make bids and not withdraw and get some chips. Finally, the game plays relatively quickly and as such I do think it’s a decent filler. However there are many other games I would rather spend my time on.

This is a lot like the game "For Sale."  It is basically a hidden-information auction game.  I think "For Sale" is more fun in large groups and Felix is more fun in small groups.  This is another great game by Friedemann Friese!

RATING: 5
Hand management game where your biggest decision is to bluff or not to bluff when you play the last/second-to-last card in the bag.  Even then, you should probably play your biggest card because then you'll be the only person who knows how much the bag is truly worth and getting stuck with your own big negative card is a sure-fire way to lose.  Its OK for a 15 minute filler, but I'd rather play No Thanks! or For Sale.

I can see why people may like Filou.  I'm also clear on why I do not like it -- it is clever and cute and almost entirely inoffensive, flavourless and fluffy without any redeeming defects or challenge.  I'll not play it again.  The semi-blind bidding is offensive to me, as is the overly manipulable bluffing.

RATING: 5.5
An interesting game with a decent bidding and bluffing mechanic, but it falls apart slightly due to two things:
1 - very little information can make early bidding, as well as card selection for the hand, nearly meaningless.  It really feels like there's not much of a reliable strategy for selecting cards to play until the very end, when most cards are out of people's hands, and this makes the first couple rounds feel a bit random.
2 - the card values are very spread out, and it feels like it's easy for a big hand to get played unintentionally and really shove someone far into the lead.

It might take a few more plays to really nail that down though, and since it's quick, I'm not against it.

After a second play, dropped for how an unskilled or odd group can throw this game awry and lead to something uninteresting.

What a pleasant surprise. Short card game fillers are not a category that I'm usually on the market for...but this one really hit the spot.

The components are a very nice quality. The rules are extremely straightforward, and the game play is short, recognizably finite, and feels just right.

The ability to bluff and bet gives this game a bit of a poker feel. The rotating limited information makes hand position (for the card you've contributed) critical....and allows for some real mind-games. 

I'd like to get a copy of this one, and would be happy to play it any time as a night-cap or whatever.

Cute little game with bizarre title/theme. Some bluffing, but its mostly luck guessing which card to play as you play a card with nothing much to base it on, esp if you're first. Easy to play although the translated rules are not very clear. Might be good with non-gamers but I think the theme would put them off - unles they hate cats!

This is a very interesting card game. It is very simple, yet there is an underlying layer of strategy in there. It is mostly a game of analyzing risk VS reward. Do you bid more hoping that those last 2 cards are good cats? Every single money is also a VP at the end, so knowing when to get out of the race is important. You should never pay more money than the amount of points in the current sac. You can never know for sure what is in there though, unless you were the person who put down the last card.

After a few games, I'm regretting my purchase at Spiel 2007. It isn't a regret which makes itself felt in a Big Way (the game is far too cheap for that), but still, had I playtested first, I wouldn't have bought it. The game is fairly simple: choose a card, lay it down in a row, turn over the first card in the row, and start bidding for the entire row which still has undisclosed cards in it. Pass, and you get a tiny sum of money ('mice' in this game); persevere and you hopefully win a lot of points. What I find exceedingly annoying about this game—and this is a trait it shares with a game like High Society—is that it is nearly impossible to 'steer' into a meaningful direction. You are at the mercy of your fellow players and must hope that your guess or bluff holds up over time. It might do that; it might equally well not. There is a subtle strategy to master regarding the spot where exactly in the bidding row you place your own card, but it isn't more than that: subtle. There isn't much [i]game[/i] in this title; it's more of an activity of going through the motions, tallying up an arbitrary score, and then noticing that the handles on the clock have moved forward by some amount. The fact that I am able to play the game picking a card at random from my deck and laying it down after giving it a cursory glance says it all, really.

If I want to wind down from a gaming session, it won't be with this cat in the bag; for me, its purchase was precisely that. I'll take a bit mercy on it for executing its chosen subject matter quite well.

[b]Update[/b] The cat in the bag was let out of the bag. Adieu, cat!

Components: Great over-sized cards with fun art. The 'mice' are a bit difficult to handle, as they're thin and slick; would have been cooler if they were actually mouse-shaped figurines.

Experience: It moves quickly, the bidding is straightforward, and the rewards are easy to evaluate; all things in its favor. I really enjoy getting paid for passing, and that cards are revealed as players pass. It's mostly arbitrary which card a player places into the mix, but it means that each player (but the first) has different information about the contents of the row. Favors the person whose card is never revealed, but that edge is minimized by the randomness of the cards in its company. I don't want to play this game often, but I enjoy it on occasion.

Very fun and lighthearted auction game. The art work of this game is what lead me to buy it. The art is simple, but so cute!

The rules are pretty easy to learn, we did have a hiccup along the way as to what direction you play, but maybe we were reading too fast? Anyways, we got through our first round and enjoyed how the game played. It was great to see how far we could put our luck and laughed when someone got suck with something. The bank system began creating player elimination at some points because there wouldn't be enough money to go around, but it worked. 

Everyone who played enjoyed it. It was easy to pick up and easy to play, we didn't run into any issues while playing.  8/10

Sort of blind bidding kind of game. There's some strategy in what card to play and its a nice use of hidden information with each player knowing something different about of the value of the pot. But overall it just felt a bit too random. Especially the turning over of cards in play order rather than (eg) turning over the card of the person who went out. That potentially leads to situations with only one of the two remaining bidders holding hidden information purely because of play order.

Minor fun, but not my cup-o-tea,

I would never want to play this game with someone who's really good at poker.

A light auction game with a neat bluffing mechanic too. Half of me says there's no real fine strategy and I just should play by instinct. The other half says that there is indeed a strong strategy to this game, but I suppose that is from the nature of the bluffing system. 

Felix's major problem is its genre. Felix is an auction game filler, so to make it to the table it has to compete with For Sale, Scripts and Scribes, High Society, and a plethora of medium-length auction game too. That being said, Felix is still worth being pulled  out on occasion.

The game design is solid enough, but the game isn't for me.  The chaos resulting from partial knowledge (which was drastically affected by turn order) and trying to infer value from others' bids was just not something I enjoyed.  Its only saving grace was that it was over quickly.

Hits a real sweet spot: tiny, fast, easy to teach, and cute, but also full of fun, entertaining things like bluffing, push-your-luck, take-that, semi-blind bidding, some psychology, keeping an eye on your supply of chips, and memory. The effect on the relative information asymmetry of where your card is in line and who drops out can be subtle and is, I suspect, what gives this game staying power. Also, deliberately bidding people up and bowing out at the right moment is just plain fun!

Fun game.  Plays better with more than 3 players.  We love cats in our home so the theme is festive for us.  However, the concept or image of a cat in a sack is a little disturbing.

Usually when we have played there's always "let's do it again."

Feels like a cross between "For Sale" (auction where people who pass still get a reward in proportion to how quickly they passed) and "Nobody But Us Chickens" (simultaneous card selection with some cards that can cancel the effects of other cards played), but feels different enough from either of them to warrant an inclusion in my collection.  It plays in 10-20 minutes, and is great value for the $10 I paid for it.  Cute artwork too.  The only luck is in which player starts the game.

Minor nitpick: They didn't seem to include enough mice money (which are black and green tiddley-wink-like pieces) to keep the banker from constantly exchanging a 5 piece for 5 1 pieces in a 5-player game.

Joguinho super divertido de blefe. Todos os jogadores colocam uma carta fechado na mesa. A "mesa" representa um saco de gatos. Estas cartas na mesa podem ser gatos com valores que vão de 15 a -8, cachorros que comem os gatos mais ou menos valiosos e coelhos (que não são gatos). Na sua vez, você pode aumentar a aposta, tentando comprar o saco, ou sair pegando um pequeno valor em dinheiro. Quem demora mais para sair pega um valor maior. Quem fica com o saco leva os gatos. No final quem tem mais dinheiro e gatos valiosos vence a partida.

AS far as simple bidding card games go, this one is a masterpiece. The slowly disclosed information, the card selection strategy and the bidding strategy mesh together perfectly to create a totally new game that is both simple and elegant... A rare feat by any standard.

RATING: 4
Felix is a bidding game. The twist here is that the bidding is open but what you are bidding for is partially unknown. Further cards in the pot are revealed as the bidding progresses but you don't usually know everything you'll get, and since a single card can often make a huge difference the game remains pretty much incalculable. Ok as a short game to end a game night but there are better bidding games in that category.

It's a game won by luck.  Fine.  I like lots of games that are won by luck.  

The problem is that it's won by luck and you win or lose EARLY in the game.  You often lose the game on the first or second auction, just by luck, and then you have to sit through the rest of the game. Incredibly frustrating.

What an excellent little bluffing game.  I came last the first two times I played this and am keen to play again.  So much for the theory that people only want to re-play games they do well in.  Granted, a certain amount relies on luck or bluff in how high you can push the other players.  But the quickness and possibilities of variable outcomes make Felix a game to try again.  Even the kids may like this one.

There is some quirky ideas behind this game as it is a nice fast auction filler with a slight bluffing element. Like in For Sale, you can really be trapped if you spend your money too early in the game. I like the artwork; it's cute and my overall impression of the game is good. While it isn't as strategic I think this is more fun to play.

I have played it with 4 and 5 players and it worked fine with both. I don't think I want to play it with 3 players.

There seems to be too much guesswork involved in this game, you're trying to evaluate the situation without much information at the start, and if you think there *might* be a decent payoff you're forced to bid high to avoid the lousy payout of 2. I don't get it.
But, maybe we just played it wrong?

RATING: 5.5
I'm willing to try it again. The resource flow didn't quite work out in our game as those who had a shortage of money had to pass early and hence were forced to take the smallest stacks of money, thereby getting even poorer compared to the opponents. This problem persisted mostly throughout the game.

I wish this were good as a casual game, but it's not-- success depends too much on nuances (keep an eye on how many chips the bank has left) and the ability to play the other players. But it is GOOD: a fun short game for people willing to bluff and manipulate each other.

The theme works, the art is brilliant but I'm left disappointed with a game that just feels too caotic.

Its a single play per session filler and not in the same league as No Thanks or For Sale.

There are far better fillers, but the push-your-luck element is integrated fantastically into the bidding engine--the longer you stay in, the more you know about the lot on which you're bidding. Too random, though, and suffers in comparison to other fillers (especially, of course, For Sale).

A different twist to a bidding game.  Players all place one of their cards face down, and 1 card is revealed until one player opts to pass, at which time s/he picks up the tokens from the 2nd column (a passing bonus if you will) and reveals the second card.  All players who did not pass may bid, the next player to pass takes the money from the 3rd column, etc.  Placing the last card provides you with a slight advantage as you know what that card is, and may therefore know the total # of points this hand will yield once the next to last card is revealed, making bluffing a distinct possibility.

The total may be negative, although some of the 'bad' cards cancel each other out if there is a pair of them on the table.

Hey, this is pretty good. Take a little Coloretto and a little Texas Hold'em and you've got a pretty nifty auction game. Since you bid on lots for which you have limited information, it's in an interesting position between betting and auctioning. Do you up your bid to see a bit more information, or drop out and grab some cheap coin? I thought it was pretty clever. By the way, what is the deal with this theme? Cats in bags? I don't get it.

Cute auction game. Each round, all players put in one card from their deck into the bidding lot. Only the last card is face-up. However, each time someone drops out of bidding, another card is revealed from the lot.

There are valuable cats.
There are negative cats.
There are dogs which may chase away the highest or lowest valued cat (depending on how many are actually in the lot.) And there is the bunny (which is just 0 pts).

So a bit of speculating, a bit of playing turn order to get a better feel for the next bid lot, a bit of card counting (all cards will be auctioned eventually). Simple but cute art.

First played January 8th, 2008. Taught in ~5min, played in ~30min with 4 players. This seems to tilt towards the luck in luck/strategy balance. It's a bluffing game. Each play is given a hand of 10 card and 20 chips (VPs). Each hand/deck is the same and consist of 15,11,8,5,3,0,-8,-5, big dog, little dog. One card is randomally removed from play before starting, so there are 9 rounds. Big dog chases the largest cat away, and the small dog chases the littliest cat away (both counting negative). If multiple dogs are in play, they are all removed. Chip cards are place down equal to the number of players. In a four player game: the first to pass get 2 VPs, 2nd get 4 VPs, 3rd gets 6 VPs, and last gets the card values (can be good and bad). In a 5 player game a 3 chip card gets placed between 2 and 4. The starting player places a card face down at the top, followed by each left most player (all hidden). Next the starting player's cards is turned up and a bidding round begins with your VPs. Pass and take VPs or up the bidding. If you know someone who has it give it a shot, however I wouldn't recommend purchase.

Pure, fun little auction game that puts in just enough information asymmetry to occasionally create little bubble markets. Nothing quite as much fun as watching people bid up and up, and then suddenly find themselves paying out the tail for a set of cards that actually costs them points!

UPDATE: Upping my rating by a half-point. This game is a crowd-pleaser, and quite possibly my new favorite filler (sorry, Parade!)

Light card game with a dose of bluffing, memorizing and tactical play.

Theoretically it's ok, but nothing new in it and the outcome is very accidental (unless players start to think heavily - but such games are not about it).  I have no desire to play it any more as there are so many better light games out there..

RATING: 6
It's a very stripped down auction game, a la For Sale, but in this one the partial information everyone has makes the bidding tougher. And really it makes it feel like it's sort of a crapshoot. It's very easy to make a somewhat low early bid mostly hoping to get a better pass payout and then have everyone in a row pass out, and it turns out you just bought -12 points for three coins or whatever. Or to overpay for something and then have not enough money left in the bank so passing next round is worthless. But luckily the game is fast and these kinds of things are easy to laugh off. Actually, I think that's the main charm of the game, when something stupid happens. Quick, light, frivolous fun. Definitely prefer it to the bland nothingness of For Sale, though there isn't really enough game for me to ever be excited about it. I guess you could count cards and be really careful about how much is in the bank at all times and play it as a more serious experience, but I suspect I'd hate it that way.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2010)

Last time I played Felix: The Cat in the Sack was almost 5 years ago so I don’t remember a lot of details. I remember it was a light game so I’m not sure if I would like the game today (on 2010 I liked almost every game I played).

I remember some things, the art is ok and I remember I felt the game was unfair toward the first players.

I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system. When I play the game again I will come back to do a proper comment on it, however I don’t have high hopes for it. Friedemann Friese is one of my least liked game designers.

I finally played the game again and I had fun playing it!

The rules are very easy to teach. Plays very fast.

It has a lot less luck than I remembered and it adds some fun bluff to the mix. The best feature by far, is that you have part of the information you are bidding on, so you have to carefully manage the risk. Having saying that, the game is still pretty light for my current tastes and the first player plays with no information.

I would play again if requested, but still Felix: The Cat in the Sack is not a game I would like to play often. It can be a good filler with the right crowd.

Blind (in that you only have partial knowledge of what your bidding on) auction game (sightly) reminiscent of No Thanks, which I also enjoy.

You need to be careful that you don't find youyrself low on tokens too much, as you'll have very little influence on the game while that's the case.

RATING: 7
A great filler game.  A push-your-luck, limited information, auction game that has gone over very well at our club.

The fact that everyone has a different set of cards to start the game makes card counting difficult, so everyone has just the right amount of dis-information.

And the 20 minute play time... even with a full set of players is a bonus.

Everybody loves it.

For me? MEH.. The concept of buying a cat in a sack is appealing for the casuals. As for a gamer, it's kind of a gambling but with people fooling you around.

Maybe it's because i lose all the time. Or maybe it's the silly mechanism of gaining money while passing. Or maybe, it's because when you ran out of money, all you got to do is passing. IDKH.

Hate you cats!!

Felix: The Cat in the Sack is a really cool little auction game mixed with just a tad of bluffing.  It certainly plays best at 5, pretty good at 4, and at 3, it's still playable, but not great.  It didn't fly to well with my crew, but I can certainly see its merits and I had a lot of fun with it.

Call it a Power Grid spinoff; if Friedmann Friese wasn't the designer of one of the great modern classics this would be strictly a 2F publication, languishing in obscurity.

It's not a terrible game, but the mechanics are every bit as goofy as the theme, and like a party game it relies entirely on the players to create the fun.

RATING: 5
A fairly light bidding card game. Players put up cats for auction and then bid on them. While the game itself is okay-ish, it suffers heavily from turn-order syndrome, meaning that if you are the start player, you have to make a bid based on zero information. The last player always has a massive advantage.

RATING: 8
Filou (or Felix) is a game about partly blind auctions in which you buy the cat (or more appropriately cats, dogs and rabbits) in the sack.

Each round a set of cards (a sack of cats) is auctioned. Each player knows the card he added to the set. But since only the first card is revealed when starting the auction, you can't know for sure what else might be in the sack. But as soon as the first player passed and took money instead of continuing to bid, the next card revealed. This continues until one of the last two players passes and takes the money, while the other player pays his bid and takes the sack.

The game feels a bit like poker with cats. That alone would probably make it a winner for some. But the auctioning with imperfect information is very well done and alwas fun.

Simple auctioning game. So far I only played it once with three and... kinda fell flat. The game is obviously best at 5, playable at 4 but... wouldn't play again with three. Higher player counts make for more interesting auctions in this game.

Interesting but fiddly bidding/auction card game. Players bid on a sack full o' cats, but can only see one of them.  As players pass from the bidding, they get a set value of money, but those left get to see another of the cats.  In the end, whoever has the most value of cards plus money wins.  Simple and fun, especially if you love kitties.

each player puts a cat card in the sack, and players bid for the sack.
At the outset each player only knows which cat he/she has placed in the bag. Now, the values of the cats vary, some have negative values, and some are not cats at all but are dogs who will chase off (cancel out) the largest cat (bad) or smallest cat (might be good if that is a negative scoring cat). In order to stay in the bidding each subsequent bid has to be higher, and if a player passes they leave the auction and a card is flipped over revealing the cat and giving a little more information to the remaining bidders. Last bidder gets the bag of cats (after any chasing off by dogs that are in there etc) and the player with the most cat points at the end wins.

Let's say we pick Poker Texas Hold'Em, remove not only the real money but also great part of the luck and the complexity, so you don't have to play keeping in mind loans of statistics and combinations and, most importantly, we change the classic cards for cats, dogs and even a rabbit. With that in mind you can have an approximate idea of what Felix is.

This is a quick filler, all about bluffing, guessing and bidding. The play is what I would describe as a simplified version version of Texas Hold'Em.

The cards not only are beautifully illustrated, but are really big and sturdy. The coins aren't spectacular, but functional nontheless.

Overall a fun little game that works like charm with nongamers and people that search for a bidding/bluffing gameplay, but may disappoint poker fans unless they are seeking for a simpler version of their game.

Well, if you want a serious auction game, this will not be satisfying. However, in my collection, this game fills the position of "a light filler that is hilarious and has some strategy".

The design of revealing cards after each player passing is brilliant. In certain cases, it causes a subsequent passing and leave a victim to take the bad set. Every time it happens, there will be a burst of laughter.

Down time is extremely low, everyone feels involved. Though it only take 5 or less players, usually a couple will not refuse to join as 1 player. So it can hold more than 5 in reality. Not bad for a party game.

In a funny coincidence, both my sister and my wife got me a copy of [thing=32125][/thing] for Christmas.  My parents had fun with [thing=172][/thing] last year, so I thought this would be a good follow up.  The artwork is cute but the chips are a little too slippery.  We ended up playing several four player games with my parents.  It does give a similar vibe to For Sale, although it feels like you have a little more control (or at least the illusion of control), and the bluffing aspect for each auction can be fun.  It's somewhat balancing that if you bid high to win a big sack, you're likely out for several auctions to rebuild your bidding power.  It's a light, filler game that's nice to have, but the best part was that afterwards my dad kept thinking about it:  "There's actually a lot to think about...there can be a lot of strategy here..."

I like this one a lot and it's soon to become a fast favorite IMHO.

As a bluffing/blind-bidding game, this is not especially novel or innovative, but it's perfectly well executed. It's got decent components, comes in a small box, and the theme (as loose as it is) is humorous, and fits well with the style of game. The game length is perfectly timed, both in duration, and in the number of rounds; there's a bit of room for strategy, but the game doesn't outstay its welcome.

This, along with For Sale, have become our "We don't have enough time for a game of Power Grid so let's play this instead" games.

This type of bluffing game really plays into the collective personality of my group.  We have loads of fun with it and we can generally get through a game, with all the required loudmouthery and smack talk, in about 10 minutes.

On a non game related note: I really enjoy the design/art of this whole package.

18 oct 07 Essen buying spree

Initial rating: Fast & fun trick taking bluff game. One of the best of it's kind I came across. It's the kind of game you still want to play for another go, even though it's already late...

Rating is for me higher than usual thanks to the very fitting theme of the game (sometimes you really buy "a cat in the sack" because you spend more than the trick is worth) and the very short playing time, combined with the huge amount of laughter it generated during my first couple of plays.  

Update march 08 (after half year of play): for some reason this silly little game has become a late-nite favorite with a lot of my gamer friends. Rating goes up half a point for the incredible amount of fun I've had with this small little card game over the last couple of months.

NL: Erg grappig & kort kaartspel waarbij je probeert je tegenstanders te slim af te zijn. Tactischer dan je denkt na je eerste potje. Dikke pret.

Kind of fun, but doesn't really hold a candle to No Thanks. Takes a little long to play, not much of a 'game arc', and is essentially blind bidding until the first couple of players drop out. Doesn't feel like you have much control over the eventual outcome.

Great fun for a light filler!  Players seed cats (cards) of different +/- values, then bid on who takes the entire sack.  Nice mix of information (what you seeded, what's been flipped) and risk management (what you're likely to bid).  Easy to learn and play... seemingly great for non-gamers!  Love the cute animal illustrations.

Really liked this simple filler, it's quite fun, with plenty of chance to bluff during the auctioning. 

The art is ok as is the quality, but nothing outstanding, also it's a bit limited on the range of players it can handle (3-5, and really it seems like you want 4 or 5), that coupled with the fact that sometimes auctions might go a tad slow (if everyone is overly cautios) is what keeps this game from getting a higher score. Still pretty good :)

Thought this was great fun.

I like my card games simple and compelling.  I don't think it outstays its welcome and the fact that the variables are changing throughout the game depending on who won the last hand really livens it up and can cause some catastrophic (oops, that was NO pun intended, honest) cock ups.

I love this game.  So far "meh" is the strongest review I've gotten from any of my gaming groups, so I might not get to play it much more.  If you like poker you could like this one.  Turn order is very important, as in poker.  Unlike poker there is a max possible value to a hand, so bluffing is very subtle.  There is also a value just in staying in to pass later for the bigger passing bonus, so there is a push your luck element that tends to drive up the minimum price.  There is a very deep game hidden here.

This is a screwage game with auctions (as opposed to an auction game with screwage) which made me want to flush every cat in existence down the world's biggest and filthiest toilet.

This game continues to be a hit each time it is pulled out.  Attractive components, simple enough to be taught quickly, fast and deep enough for multiple plays.  Always good for a couple of humorous moments during a session - everybody is sure to react to flipping the last card and finding a 15 . . . or a -8 . . . or a second dog . . . 

Plays best with 5, and fine with 4.  With 3, the introduction of a dummy hand means you should find a different game to play.

This game has a lot of player-chaos with some minor bluff elements.  If you really like seeing essentially random things happen to you and other players, this is a fun filler to look into.  I'm not sure I care for the rule about what happens if the bank can't pay out all the cards, but that's a relatively minor complaint.  I think there are better games that fill the 20-minute filler niche, but YMMV.

I really enjoy this game, the card art and bluffing mechanic make this a fun and humorous game! I especially love playing this with kids, they will astonish you with interesting bluffing techniques and their random contributions to the cat sack!

Very nice bluff / bidding game.  In the same vein as For Sale, but lighter.

Played a third time (first 2 at Essen). A great filler that manages to combine For Sale-style gameplay with Poker-style bluff and double-bluff. Getting smoked will happen, but it's fun anyway - a good filler should be one that's as much fun to lose as to win, and in that respect Filou is one of the best.

A cross between Geschenkt and Nobody But Us Chickens, and add in some bluffing. I picked it up as a light opener and it's seen some play, but results seem to be so dominated by turn order that it's not entered into the regular rotation. You're bidding in turn order to pick up the score cards placed in the middle, 1 from each player. As players pull out, cards are revealed in order. The player with the last card in controls the round really. If he bails out, then everyone bails out in turn, expecting a negative score card. And sure enough, there it is. If he stays in, then it may be worth staying in. Or ... you stay in, eventually he pulls out, everyone else folds in turn, you find he bluffed you immensely, get bum points and you've been effectively knocked out of future bidding rounds with less money than the others. Funny for the moment, but it's a one trick pony that's not satisfying enough for repeat play.

Big cards. This is a basic push-your-luck-while-bidding game which actually offers some tough decisions and people reading. A lovely game to play because of its quickness. This game can be brutal if you're in wrong position.

Fun bluffing game! Some really hilarious buys sometimes! Chaotic, quick  and fun. And very cute graphics as well.
Almost a 9 rating for this after two more plays. Also takes very little table room so you can even play it in the pub! Even more fun with beer...

袋中菲力貓，一款小品的競標遊戲，每個人每回合都要蓋著放一張袋中貓or狗or兔在場中，接著開始喊價，不敢加碼的人就可以先拿走一些鼠幣，每次有人pass拿鼠幣後就會翻開一張袋中貓讓大家看看是啥好料，撐越久越後面才pass的人可以拿比較多的鼠幣，而只有出最高價的人可以獲得當回合所有的袋中貓，但是不見得有賺......有可能加起來是負分，或是高分的貓被狗狗叼走!!競標9個回合以後誰鼠幣多就贏啦

I like simple card game fillers, and this one's rock solid. Large cards with great cute artwork. A hybrid bluffing/auction game: some players know more about the value of the lot than others, so you want to watch and possibly match their bidding strategies. Of course, they could simply be bluffing. Lots of player-induced chaos, which does make everything kinda random; but in this game I don't really mind it.

Note: error in the Dutch rules. Money is worth points at the end of the game!

RATING: 6
Another trip through familiar filler territory like Geshenkt, For Sale and High Society whereby you bid to pick up or avoid cards which increase or decrease your score, modified by money held at game end (though in High Society having the least money eliminates you). Where Felix differs is there is a stronger element of staring down your bidder(s) for body language clues, as the cards up for grabs are placed by each player (initially all but 1 of them are facedown). Raising your bid may uncover more "tells", or you may bluff to squeeze money vp out of a player’s “kitty”. The real question is can you read your opponent(s) as to value of the card (s) still face down (and what has been played before and what is left). Thankfully being able to relate in this regard is helped by each player having the same set of card (with the twist being one is randomly removed at the start). Another unique aspect is bids are retrieved and you earn an increase in bonus money the later you pull out, only the final bid coughs up.  This brings up the fun part in that the cards finally revealed can either be negative or sometimes “scare off” valued cards, much like Pick Picknic, Nobody Here But Us Chickens etc.  With the stronger elements of fun sit-com and bluff almost makes this the best of this crop, though High Society may still have it in the bag.
Update: the real highlight in this game is when the 2 players left in the bidding have their cards face down, so in this case the bluffing psychology really kicks in. Also there is a focus of trying to 'milk' the leader of his money, as well as ensuring there is enough mice in the pot for the next round. Not bad for a pokeresque game, but cashing in at the end dampen the fun highlights and dramatic tension of the play. Reminds me that another cat bidding game (Katzenjammer Blues) is far better.

RATING: 4
A light and simple filler card game with similarities to Geschenkt, High Society, and For Sale. The main mechanic of the game is an open auction in which one has to outbid the previous player or drop out of the auction. Dropping out earns you a few coins- the first player to drop out gets two coins, and subsequently the plyers who drop out get progressively a few more coins. The player who outbids all others, thus the one who does not drop out till the end wins the pot, but is the only player who loses his bid amount. The pot consists of one card from each player placed face down prior to the start of the auction. Each card has a number on it, some positive, some negative, which collectively determine the total points. At the end of the game the coins are also added to the total points. Most points wins.

It is light and simple but strangely I found it stressful. You have to make serious or even make or break decisions with very little information. It is not a push your luck game, but more like gambling and very chaotic. There are some subtle ways to improve your odds and especially you do have some leverage when you go last, but still a big part of the game is just guessing.

The three games I mentioned above are all superior to this.

A combination of a trick taking card game and no-peek poker. I think it's going to become a favorite of mine.

Beautiful large cards (similar size as Lost Cities), plays a bit like For Sale, but all the exceptions make the rules a bit harder to learn. Take some learning to figure out when to play each of your cats, more bluffing is involved than other auction games. Still overall an entertaining game. 

Update: Better with more people, an interesting mix of luck and strategy, as you don't know what is in the sack, and at the same time you try to match the cat you played against your bidding strategy. Too complicated to be the classic For Sale is, but still a fun auction game. Unlike For Sale, since winner takes all, for sacks of really good cats it's easy to be outbid by the player with more money than you, which makes bidding less interesting.

It's an interesting bidding an bluffing game with a small splash of memorization.  It makes for a nice light filler.  I like the different strategy approaches you can use to psych out the rest of the field. The mice mechanic feels a little off to me, because it seems the rich tend to get richer, and the poor get forced out out bids early keeping them poor, but I guess that you just need to keep in mind as you play.

A game with bluffing/auction and a push your luck element. In it you try to grab the best scores from what is available. The fun part is things don't become known until people start dropping out the bidding. So you know the first card and your own and have to tailor your bidding to what you know. 
The last players have the advantage so make sure that the number of rounds around the table is even for all players.

For Sale is a more elegant action/bluffing game. However, this is not bad for quick light (cheap) filler

First impression: Good little betting game where you have to manage your bets in order not to run out of money and being able to bet on the ones that you feel is your best choice. This game has a certain risk management involved. Having all the same cards at the start of the game, you have to try to figure out, with the cards that have been played, the upcoming ones in elaboring your next bets. This game has a certain Texas Old'em pocker feel.


First impression: Bon petit jeu d'enchères ou il faut s'assurer de ne pas trop miser ou épuiser notre argent afin de pouvoir participer aux enchères de notre choix. Il y a une certaine part de gestion du risque. Ayant tous les mêmes cartes au départ il faut essayer de voir ce qui est passé et ce qui reste à venir dans l'élaboration de nos enchères. Ceci à un petit coté Texas Old'em pocker.

This is a really fun bidding / bluffing / double-bluffing game.  If you're like me and like to play it safe you will do well, but often not well enough to win.  It's also possible to "lose" early if you get stuck with a terrible bag.  I don't mind that so much because the game is fun and fast, so even if I take a terrible bag and end up out of the running, at least I will be able to commiserate with others that meet the same fate, and potentially score a decent bag later.

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would because I am not a big fan of Friedmann Friese, mainly due to this themes. This game is very simple but good. The core mechanics are bluffing and bidding as well as reading the other players. Well balanced. 

EDIT: Played it a few times and found it can be a tad too random an unpredictable what to do and some of the guesswork is more luck than anything else (although it is of course another player's decision)

A very fun light-weight bidding game. I like how only the winning bid pays, as strong positioning can put you up in the money so you don't necessarily need to get any cards. But it does help.

In a 5p game, there were 2 rounds where no money was put on the cards, and I think I took the 6 money cards every other time, except for the one round that I won on.

Clever card & bidding game.
Do you bid high for the sack contents & end up with the scraggy, point-losing cats (although I think the -5 cat is actually quite a cutie!), or will you get the point-perfect pedigree? 
Clever use of the dogs can scare off the best or worst, or will they just play with each other.

Simple auction game with loads of luck. Feels like poker in that bids can be used as bluffs.

Obligatory obvious tactical advice: 

Having points in money (mice) is better than having the same number of points in cards. Having more mice gives a player the potential to stay in the bidding longer, giving them the potential to either win the bid or pass later to accrue even more mice.

I see this game as one that adults and kids can play toghether to have fun.  My 9 yo daughter picked up on the mechanics rather quickly and was able to join the gaming group for a 5P game (and came in second also).  

Of course, this could just mean that random luck is a stronger determinant of final position than skill.  But the game is an attractive little package with some nice elements.  Giving up liquid points (chips or mice points) for illiquid points (cards) is an interesting concept as one (with practice) probably needs to think ahead so as to prevent forced passing due to lack of funds.

While folks have talked about a bluff element in the game, this probably takes some time to come out, especially when played with larger groups.  Rated a 6 right now as I am still uncertain how the game will stand-up to repeated plays...but certainly small and quick enough that I hope to get in more plays soon to find out and adjust my provisional rating.

This is a descent filler.  I like the general game play, but also realize that playing well relies heavily on guessing well at what your opponent is going to play.  I actually found that taking cards out of each players hand at the begining made this game less than it could be.  Since the winner of the previous round bids first and know nothing about the cards his opponents have played, I feel like it would help if perfect knowledge were involved.Overall a good filler!

Fun auction game of buying sets where the information is slowly revealed as people leave the auction. You have to be careful about overbidding in this game, because if you have no chips, you won't be able to stay in the bidding long enough to pass for higher chip counts and may be forced to leave several auctions immediately and only gain two chips for the next round. One player was particularly upset by that.

A light, pure-auction filler which I've played multiple times across all player counts. The unique aspect of Felix is that players only have partial information of the actual value of the set that all players are bidding for. As players drop out of the auction, more information is revealed to players who are still in the auction.

While this sounds interesting on paper, the ensuing auction seems a bit too random. The usefulness of the information that you possess is highly dependent on the other cards in the set, and given that cards can easily be negated by other cards, the value of the set can swing greatly from one card's reveal to another. Yes, there is a strong bluffing aspect, but misread your opponents once and you could knock yourself out of the game. There's also an element of memory involved as you can gradually deduce what cards are remaining in your opponent's hand, but that doesn't seem worth the effort for a game this light.

For sale meets No Thanks. Works well. Quick fun filler with nice large cards. The intermeshing cards (with cards that negate each other), push your luck and a clever economic balancing system (limited chips) = great little filler.

Annyira nem zseniálisan egyszerű, mint a For Sale, ezért az eggyel kisebb pontszám. De élményben majdnem ugyanolyan szintű aukciós játék. A kivitelezése még szebb is. Nagyon aranyos macskák és kutyák a kártyákon, amik nagyon nagy méretűek. Szép a doboz is. Itt nincs két kör, mint a For Sale-ben, de majdnem hasonló a játékmenet, amit a negatív és kutyás kártyák bonyolítanak meg. Gyors, jó kis átvezető játék.

[2011-04-02]
Másodszori parti után azért már látok hibát a játékban. Általában egy jó kör megszerezésével meg lehet nyerni a játékot, ami nem túl jó fényt vet a játékra.
7->6

[2011-06-17]
A pontszám talán véglegesen marad ennyi. Sajnos az egy jó kör elve továbbra is igaznak tűnik a játékra, de a kivitelezés és az izgalmas játékélmény miatt azért közepesnél eggyel jobbra értékelem.

[2011-10-22]
Ötödik parti kellett ahhoz, hogy ne egy jó körrel dőljön el a játék. Tehát van esély izgalmas játékra, de remélem ennél jobb lesz az arány később.

[2013-01-05]
Minél többet játszom vele annál kevésbé tetszik. Mégis muszáj rontanom még egyet a ponton, mert nagyon nehéz többször is vinni, általában egy-egy sort visz mindenki.

I want to like it.  This seems like a so simple it should work kind of game, and for the most part it does.  Unfortunately, it also can go pear-shaped  quickly leading to imbalanced games.  Because the initial player has to bid or pass with no information it is just a random stab in the dark, there is no real way of valuating each round. (Essentially all the fun of the first round of Werewolf, which is to say "no fun")  Yes, all players must endure this, but I'd rather be playing a game with some information other than rough card counting.  This is compounded by the fact that player cards are revealed in turn/bid order as well.  I would be curious to see how this played if the game ran counterclockwise and the first player bid last.

A bad break on a run of cards can effectively eliminate a player with no way to come back, yet they "must" continue to play.  This also can imbalance the game-play by taking essential cards out of the mix.

I also feel that the 6 chip consolation prize is far too valuable, and the player that gets it is just in the right place at the right time.  If a player runs low on cash they will be in a force pass often and this will allow for the 6 prize to get dumped over and over into the lap of the same player.  It would make more sense if it were worth 5 to encourage people to stay in.  An assured 6 is often better than the delta between a risked/won bid and the prize.   

The art is fantastic, and it seems like there was some inspiration, but all in all it just seemed flat and random.

Felix is an interesting card game, and it really does feel like you're bidding on/buying a pig in a poke (or a cat in a sack, as the German expression goes).  Bought at BGG.con 2007, taught to us by Friedemann Friese himself.  My only wish is that the cards weren't unusually large, because they won't fit in a travel container.

Man, did I make a mistake. I thought this would be a light auction game that I could play with my five year old in a year or so (since she loves cats), but the valuation part of the game is way beyond her. It was also way beyond most of us adults for the first half of the game. Chaotic and fun.EDIT: Okay, so we adults played it totally wrong. It's still difficult to evaluate, but not as arbitrary as we thought. I like it and like it as an alternative to For Sale. Also, my five year old can play it (and does like it because of the cats), not just very well.

Now that we finally figured out the proper way to play, I quite like this game. As Foppen was Freise's take on Hearts for 6, this is his blind bidding poker game with lots of bluffing. A great filler or better yet a night cap, this game encourages lots of table talk and is fun at the same time. It also started to reveal itself the more we played. Leading with a bunny can be disasterous, try the small dog for safety measure. Remember to keep your money hidden as it makes all the difference.

A great bidding game, with surprising depth.  I really like that you don't know much about the value what you're bidding on, since it's only as each person drops out that the next card is revealed to indicate what you're bidding on.  A single card can dramatically change the value, so it has fun unpredictability.  I also enjoy the closed economy so that you can only get chips by not winning an auction.

Oh, this was a fun diversion.  Some bluffing, some guessing, centered around an auction mechanic which will let you push others around.  It will also work with non-gamers, and the cats will draw them in.

It's a quick game of semi-blind bidding where you get more and more info about the lot you're bidding on as people drop out of the auction. The lot can include positive and negative points, and modifiers. Each player adds one item to the lot, so has partial info. It's a fun game!

A fun, light auction style game that can be played in 15-20 minutes.  Money management is highly important here-run out of chips too quickly and you pay dearly.

[RGG 2007 edition] {Animal, filler; auction, bluffing, set-collection; optimal 5p} Felix the Cat in the sack is a cute filler, of which the target audiences are families. It may be suitable for some children (auction & bluffing game are not always for children). It's interactive, fun and fast (a typical game is around 20mins).  However, the theme is thin.

Bidding game normally involves heavy calculation; however, it's not that taxing in Felix because players cannot calculate a bid accurately due to the partial information (hidden cards in the set and one discarded card during game setup); thus, a bidding round runs quite fast.  Due to the partial information, bluffing is possible, esp. when you are the last player to reveal a card. In Felix, it is essential to maintain their cash flow; esp. in late game; otherwise, they could just watch a player gets a decent bargain.

The cards are larger than common RGG card games, which are as large as Lost Cities'.  The box size is not standard, either. The illustration of cards and the sack token are really cute but the coins are not that great - they are dull; they could have denominated.

[Comparison] It is quite similar to another game in my collection, Blindes Huhn.  Both are fun and cute filler. I am happy to own both.

Not a bad little filler game.  Too early to judge on this game completely but the first two games felt like control was a little out of reach and that the winner could come down to random elements rather than playing your cards right.

Such a great game for four or five players (the three player version doesn't really work). Each player places a card face-down, one card is turned face-up, then everybody starts bidding for the whole collection of cards. The twist is that some of the cards actually give negative points, and there are cards (the dogs) that can chase away the best or the worst cards. As players pass out of the bidding, more and more cards are revealed so the other players see more information about what they're bidding on. Clever design that lends itself to a lot of bluffing and risk.

This is For Sale lite with bluffing elements thrown in.

It is surprisingly fun and works for two reasons - the game plays quickly and the theme/art are funny.

If this game were 15% longer or if the art/theme were even a little less well done I wouldn't bother.

I like to have lots quick fillers around so there is a place for this in my collection.

It scales well from 3-5.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4.25

A solid bidding game, with cute cards, that are sure to bring your non-hardcore-boardgammers friends (there are those who aren't? I don't know them, but you might do!), to at least give it a go. But be aware: if you bet to much in the first or second round, and you are out of the game, as you can recover money in time to bet strongly again.

Hmm, an ok game. I really wanted to like it, but not exactly a thriller. There are enough twists in this game that I think it will get taken out once in a while, but the game will not be a main staple. In some cases, I thought the game felt a little anti-climatic because of the leads people were having. Also, people tend to overbid and when they are out of coins, the game sort of kicks into a passing mode. Still, this game deserves several more plays before i decide whether it is actually a decent game.

Works well as a 20 minute filler.  Nice colorful oversized cards (reminded me of Animalia's cards a little).   Would play again and will be giving these as gifts.

A nice auction game, with some similarities with "No thanks", but I like this one a bit more. 

Players have "partial" information concerning the stacks of cards they are bidding for

Buen juego de subastas, en mi opinión un poquito mejor que "No thanks". Los jugadores tienen información parcial acerca de los lotes de subasta.

This game sort of feels like it squeezes the two distinct halves of For Sale into one game. Unfortunately, turn order seems to be even more of an issue here than in For Sale, which was my only quibble with the latter.

Friedemann Friese (Power Grid); "Buying the cat in the sack" ("Buying a pig in a poke"); Card Game; players attempt to grab the famous cat in the sack. In the sack, there are both good and bad cats. Each player can also put a dog or rabbit into the sack instead of a cat, allowing players to bluff one another. At game end, all positive cats and mice count plus points, but negative cats count minus points; alternate names: Filou - Die Katze im Sack, Minoes - Kat in de zak, Filou - Le chat dans le sac

This is a neat little bidding game, though it's a little difficult to get that first turn or two.  Overbidding on the first auction can cost you the game, and not having an idea of when to stop and when to push forward may contribute to making that decision.  But it's not a bad design, since it's an auction/bluffing/push-your-luck sort of game, and I can see it improving with future plays.

Loved this the first time I played it, and considered ordering a copy of my own right there. What gives me pause is the emphasis on memorization for such a light game. I really hate games (especially "light" ones) where giving one player a piece of paper and a pencil nets them a big advantage. Still, the mechanic of bidding before all the cards are seen feels like poker without the boring parts (folding garbage hands over and over). If I remember I will probably buy this, and I might try a variant that forces players to put the cards they've played face up in front of them.

This is a blind bidding game that is a lot of fun. The theme is useless but the game play flows and involves a surprising amount of strategy. Some people I have played this game with have felt that they got stuck in a hole. While I do not personally feel that way I can see where the impression can come from.

This auction/blind bidding style game just wasn't for us, though I wanted to give it another try.  Played with the family - me, hubby, kids ages 13 & 9, and no one wanted to play again.  There are other filler-type games we would rather play.

Played a few times (with 4 or 5 players). A short and interesting auction game with a twist. Control is not always very good, which can be a bit annoying when a player gets an obvious early lead. However, the game is short enough, so it is not too much of a problem.

Hilariously chaotic (but not completely chaotic) bidding game.

"What the heck is in this sack? And why am I willing to pay so much money for it? Everybody else seems willing to pay for it too, so maybe it's something good...or maybe they're just bluffing? Aaaaah, I just paid $10 for a sack full of biting, clawing, nasty cats!"

Great theme with some wonderfully illustrated cards.  However, I'm not very taken with games that is purely auction driven.  I'll admit there were a couple of laugh out loud moments when someone gets stuck with negative points, as long as that person wasn't yourself.  However, it seems that at least one person will always end up with a lot of chips to spend, and if most or all of the special cards have been used, there's no way to prevent him from getting the points that are left.

Bottomline: Felix is quick and simple, but probably won't stand up to more than occasional plays.

After 2+ Plays: Not horrible, but I'm not going to suggest over the myriad of other, better, fillers.  The main feature is a pretty basic decision of spending money for points now or getting more money to buy points later.  The supposed bluff element just doesn't work out in practice, as there's not enough information to attempt to deduce the final unseen card.

One of the very best short games in my collection. Easy to explain, plenty of bluffing, and pushing your luck. The artwork is also very attractive. While the usual short auction game recommended first by popular concensus seems to be "For Sale", I prefer "Felix".

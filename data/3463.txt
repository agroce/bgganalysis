I tried hard to get this on EBay, but the price was too rich for my blood.  The entire Microquest series seemed like such a cool idea, and it still does.  I only experienced this game in a quick 2-on-2 duel, and in that arena, with novice wizards, it's going to be over fast (I missed my first 2 alpha strikes, and it was pretty much over). 
Between this and [thing=3464][/thing], I preferred Melee because I always prefer hand-to-hand combat over magic ("Klingons do not cast spells!") but this one is a lot richer in what it offers. Combine them together or with the Microquest expansions and I can see where this series was that special. Otherwise, it's a fun filler.  But after playing these, [thing=5206][/thing], [thing=5205][/thing] and many other Metagaming Concepts games, it's pretty obvious that Steve Jackson's games were the on an entirely different level from the others.

Takes the already great Melee system and adds magic.  A great addition.  Talk about Jr. High memories!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice add on to Melee, and in some ways better.  A lot of bang for the buck.  It does, however, have an issue in that a wizard that specializes in a good missile spell can quickly end any duel (easy enough to fix by just banning such in duels), the focus of the game as published.

However, the lack of a decent skill based progression system detracts considerably so it's use as a stand alone RPG system is very limited.

Melee was my first RPG ever. I loved it and will always think of it as the best. Wizard was, of course, the next logical buy. Loved it as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Well-balanced and very quick sorcery duel game.  I didn't play this nearly as much as its sibling Melee (Melee was even quicker and had zero lookup involved), but the system is terrific.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Oh Hell!, with extra cards.  And those extra cards add a LOT to the game.  If you like trick-taking games, this one is a great classic - don&#039;t miss it.

RATING: 5
The companion to Melee. And as such the 'Yin" to it's "Yang".  Once I had both games(Melee, Wizard= TFT) I only went back to Dungeons & Dragons when held under water for long periods of time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Extends the Melee system to fantasy combat. Logical and eminently playable.  The best is the use of images (can't disbelieve, but can't get hit), illusions (can disbelieve, but do real damage until you do disbelieve), and summons (do real damage, can't be disbelieved, but expensive to cast/retain).

Wiz-War added some strategy (steal 2 treasres, defend your own), but this was the first playable 'duelling wizards' game.

Partner game to Melee, Wizard added spells but kept the same credible, easy, and elegant play.  While D&D was more detailed, this allowed quick pick up play that one did not have to spend days on.

good addition to melee, but not as much fun...the effects of casting powerful spells are debilitating on the Wizards leaving them vulnerable.

This is the step up from Melee, adding magic.  The fatigue rules make the magical combat actually very tactical, while allowing warriors to still be far stronger if they get into range.

A quick, fun game that competed with D&D in my early teen years. The one thing that brings down my rating is that you're expending hit points (yeah, I know, that's D&D terminology) just to cast a spell.

RATING: 7.1
A great add-on to Melee.  In theory you can play this one its own, but Wizard really shines when played with Melee.  Wizard offers a precise defined magic system, ideal for the tactical table-top player.  Hardcore Roleplayers may feel there is too little here, but those who prefer board and miniature games will appreciate the precision of this elegant system.

Stored with Melee in a custom box.

RATING: 10
I had this as a 9, but it occurs to me that I spent as much time playing this as I did plain Melee. If Melee is a 10, and it is, then this is a 10. Has some limitations, mainly in the number of spells, but considering the price (at the time) and the size, there's a remarkable amount of gaming goodness. I got countless hours of enjoyment from this game, along with Melee and (later) from The Fantasy Trip. Historically interesting, too, as a stage in the evolutionary process that would lead Steve Jackson to create GURPS, the best RPG ever. I'd like another copy, preferably uncut, for my collection. MEDIUM priority. See my [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/72843]Wizard game review[/url] for more information.

RATING: 7
Psychedelic Melee -the fighters include one more parameter (IQ) for the choice of spells but the system has got the same backbone and the same virtues (clarity, replayability, flexibility). 

The main advantage of Wizard is the wide range of available spells, including images and illusions (which hurt as real figures but can be disbelieved, isn't that wily); its logical main drawback is the long time devoted to setting up the wizards in comparison to the duration of the actual game (as Melee, short and bloody).

I fell in love with this game and Melee as a kid and I still enjoy them.  Along with the rest of The Fantasy Trip, it was the best gaming dollars I ever spent.  The earlier edition (with dragon on cover) has two counter sheets so is a better value.

--Dec2003-- Melee plus spells.  Probably better balanced (but less 'fun') than The Fantasy Trip.  Still, it's not the ideal point in the rules journey.  Melee is a reasonable minimal set.  The Fantasy Trip adds loads of colour, and is delightful.  And so rather than play Wizard, we move to one of the two extremes.

Yup, this was high school all right, sitting around the cafeteria fitting in frantic games of Melee and Wizard during lunch breaks.  Remarkably great system, and I never cared much for fantasy games -- but Wizard was too much fun to pass up.  I've still got my copy, and I have to say that the cover art where a wizard is siphoning off some dude's face into a bubble is a perfect '10' in terms of the horror it used to make me feel.  Also, that wizard on the cover bore an eerie resemblance to my high school French teacher...

This came out early on in the fantasy role-playing/board gaming cycle.  Detailed fantasy combat with monsters. I really like the cut out figures and well thought out combat mechanics, but it requires some study to play, not your quick filler. Very detailed magic use pre-D&D. Extremely glad to have this rarity. Purchased at War & Pieces, West Hartford CT. I still have the pad I scribbled all my games into in the late 1970s/early 1980s - played lots of this back then!

Good game.  Imo, too many variations on the rules.  Great if you like that sort of thing, but I like a definite game system to play with.  When I first got this, it was complex for me, but with some patience it can be a good enough game.

I'm not a hex and counter, operational wargame kind of guy so I would not play it but I don't feel like I can give it a lower rating as there is clearly a good tactical level wargame here.

So take my rating with a grain of salt.

I rocked this one back in the day...Loved all the different squads presented. Great scenarios and easy to make more on your own.My gaming buddy at the time always wanted to used rocket armed troops (totally silly) so it always devolved into weird fire fights. Would like to get this one again...

Very fun game. Don't go berserk with all the advanced & optional rules; the standard game is pretty straighforward & streamlined, and if you keep it that, you'll be happy.

Pretty good game with a unique scale.  Chit activation makes it somewhat solo friendly, and keeps both sides in a FTF game guessing.  A lot of detailed charts to refer to.  Its pretty cool to control one guy and have him duck behind the window of a building.  The house to house at this scale rocks.

Base system captures the nature of infantry combat, yet the game also managed to encompass the wide variety of armies and their equipment of the era.

maybe my memories of this game are flawed (it's been 20+ years) but I found this game to be WAY too detailed and very cumbersome.
Dividing up tons of equipment amongst the half dozen or so soldiers was just kind of a pain in the butt.
I sold it on eBay a few years ago.  (I think I got a whole dollar for it)
If you like war games that allow you to control every aspect of individual soldiers almost down to the socks they're wearing, then this is the game for you.

Absolutely the best detailed wargame for squad level, post WWII combat.  I literally wore out a copy of this game in college.  I Must point out (after reading other reveiws) that the "Basic Game" should be used as an intro to the system only.  The "Advanced Game" and "Optional Game" make this 'the' most detailed and accurate game of its type and so flexible we played a "Red Dawn" camp. game in college.  Record keeping is minimal for a 'wargame' with this type of detail (mostly involves chart references).  If you like post WW2 squad level wargames with tons of detail, don't pass this one up.  

I no longer own a copy that can be played and now get my tactical fix with miniatures in 1/72nd scale using my own rules inspired by this very game system.

I bought this game thinking it was a modern version of [gameid=1035].  Not exactly - although this game is very detailed it is not as complex, and it is at a man-to-man level instead of squad vs. squad.  It uses a chit-pull activation mechanism that was fairly new at the time it was published.  Additional scenarios and a campaign game were available in the [i]General[/i].  Currently unplayed.

Tactical combat from the Vietnam War and forward. Played this quite a bit in the mid-eighties. Today, I have lost my taste for high-complexity wargames like this, but at the time the game was enjoyable. Complexity was over the top though, so we mostly stuck with straight infantry fights. Setting up claymore mine traps for the enemy to blunder into was good fun for this particular teenager. :)

Used to be my favorite tactical game, which isn't saying much (hence only a 5 rating). Have been waiting for a quality tactical game that doesn't require 15 die rolls in order to move one man up a tree and have him shoot someone.  This game used to come closest to those requirements.  I like the chit system, and the relative simplicity of the combat mechanics.  Combat Commander (GMT) has now taken its place as my favorite tactical game.

I really want to give this a 7, but the game perplexes me.  It's incredibly detailed on a very small scale.

Thoroughly enjoyed the basic game, so couldn't wait to dig in to the advanced rules.  However, the scenario we played (Vietnam jungle scenario) was not tuned at ALL to the system.  It was impossible to fire at anyone more than 2 hexes away, so the game devolved into stacks of guys running around meleeing hapless soldiers in optimal firing posture.  Left a bad taste in our mouths, so we moved on to another title.

Would do well with an update - in some ways its attempt to be all things to all gamers resulted in too little information on the counters (virtually none) and too much on charts, causing frequent flipping through them to play.  Would do better, IMO, with a smaller time frame, perhaps even a focus on a given conflict and re-done player aid materials to speed up play.  Still, a fun game.

Single man scale detailed combat in modern theaters. More a kit than a game, it's a skirmish miniatures game without miniatures, with a lot of statistics and very complete rules. As of today is too much clumsy, but it's still a very detailed view on modern infantry combat if you have the patience to deal with all the tables.

RATING: 6
 Game was a precursor to the "Squad Leader" type bookcase
games. Really liked the weapons assignment chart that
gives often obscure weapons to little known units involved in "brushfire" conflicts (Pakis vs. India).
 Not sure if the CRT is balanced. Played the "Firebase
Scenario" with Special Forces Squad + supporting Montagnards Vs. large force Viet Cong (3 to 1). 
Result ? VC totally wiped out with one "shaken" SF observer.
 Still, I'm thinking about going back to these bookcase games as a relief to today's video games. 
  The AH Squad Leader type bookcase games might have more of a resemblance to actual historical events and weapon
varieties/abilities. Judging by those Internet prices, there's
still quite a lot of dedicated Squad level boardgamers out there.

Admittedly, I have not played this game in some time but I still think it is underrated here on BGG. The biggest complaint is the rulebook which is written in "Don Greenwood-ese" (an obscure language that either comes naturally to you or it doesn't). This is unfortunate given that Craig Taylor wrote some of the best rulebooks in the hobby when he did games for Battleine and Yaquinto. 

Gameplay is quite good and what we have come to expect from a Craig Taylor design - good, solid fun combined with a few wrinkles to keep things interesting. For me, the only real downside is the lack of extra maps, which would have fleshed out the design more and given more value to those who had bought the game.

As it is, I think it is a solid design and one that I hope to come back to someday. Given when it was published, you can't really use it for post-USSR conflicts but as a scenario generator for 80's conflicts, this is a great value.

I own a copy of this game but only had a chance to play it once or twice.  It was kind of hard for me to get into.  The man to man scale in the game seemed to me to maybe be just a bit too small for my tastes, as turns seem to represent really short periods of times but take a fair bit of time to actually complete.  As such, I started gravitating more towards games on a Fire Team/Weapon Team level than man to man combat.

Played this a few times but it was basically a miniatures game packaged as a boardgame. Did a few Vietnam scenarios but it never took my fancy really. Bit disappointed by it. Get Ambush Alley instead.

game is complete; gameboards are never used, on some pages in the rulesbook text is highlighted; on some sheets too; 
as a compensation you will receive a lot of painted US and VC miniatures so you can play the Vietnam scenario's 3D.

Traded this away.

A fun game in its basic form. A bit chart intensive in the advanced rules. I usually don't play this time period, though, so I don't play the game that often either.

A highly overlooked game.  I really enjoyed the solitare rules included in with it.  Pretty unique among wargames in the 5 meter/hex scale.  Definately worth playing.

Uses a brilliantly simple impulse system to reflect the &quot;friction&quot; inherent in small-unit actions. James Werbaneth&#039;s Firepower articles in The General are a must-read if you enjoy this game!

When me and my buddy played this back in the 1980s we used a scenario with the Soviets in Afganistan.  We created our squads and still laugh at how slow the Soviet soldiers were because of bad rolls.

A highly detailed Squad-Level wargame.  A lot of emphasis on real equipment, including massive lists of (at the time) conventional arms.  Some very cool rules for a quasi-campaign that guide you on improvements in your squad from battle to battle, morale, etc.

Pretty heavy detail, a classic grognard kind of title.

Man-to-man is not my preferred scale. I had more fun with the TSR version of SPI's Sniper.

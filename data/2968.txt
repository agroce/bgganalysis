A light and simple 2 player game.  Plays fast and is a breeze to teach making it ideal for me to introduce to many non-gamers when we're trying to kill some time.  Has some simple yet functional components, which I highly appreciate as it makes set up and clean up a breeze.  In terms of compact 'trading themed' card games which play great with two, this game is a bit simpler than Jaipur and Traders of Carthage, but some may find it just as good.

A very simple 'buy & sell' card game. Only for 2 players. There's no luck involved apart from the initial setup. It's fun if you want a simple game to spend some time. The art work is nice. The low score is only because it's just a very simple game.

Very good quick two-player game of looking ahead to set yourself up for scores.  I love how you can deliberately buy "crappy" cards in order to form pairs to sell off and shift the timing of the turns so that your opponent is forced to make a bad move.  It is a perfect information game, which means some players may be bit by analysis paralysis, but if you can cajole people to play quickly it is quite fun.  MUCH better than Buried Treasure!

Excellent quick 2 player game that appears to be a kids' game on the surface, but has enough "meat" to keep adults interested.  Good multiplication practice for kids, but once they look past the immediate gratification of selling off stock to make money, they'll start to see the importance of forward planning.  Lots of fun trying to accomplish what you want without opening up too much opportunity for you opponent.

Components: Minimal, functional artwork in the Combit edition; cheerful, bubbly artwork in the Ka-Ching! edition; I especially like the illustrations on the money.

Experience: There are lots of vexing decisions to be made. I often want to take two cards, or no cards; want to cash in to get money, but don't want to pass up a good card; want to end the game but get a few more cards before I do. Tense. The strategies seem to be in forcing my opponent to reveal a card I want, or to take advantage of my opponent not having any money. Maybe that goes without saying. But I like it.

Granted I've only been able to play this once but as far as 15-20 minute 2 player games go, this is a winner!  I need to play a few more games to see if there's some kind of a problem but based on the first play it feels right.  There's some tension as the end of game seems near and the stalling tactics start appearing which is always a good thing.

RATING: 6
Interesting game, worth playing occasionally.  Someone else compared it to Buried Treasure in these ratings, which I also did as soon as we got done playing it the first time.  Unfortunately, it lacks the unpredictable elements that make Buried Treasure more than a complicated counting exercise.  In other words, this game ends up being not much more than a complicated counting exercise.  By which I mean that it's dry and calculating.  It's not bad, but there are better games to spend your two-player time with.

RATING: 5.5
This is a decent 2-player kids game (or very simple adults game) that helps to reinforce some simple addition and multiplication skills.  On your turn, you either buy an available stock card (numbered 2 to 6 in 5 different types) from the bottom of a 5 X 7 grid, paying a cost equal to the number on the card, or you sell two stock cards you own of the same type for the two values on the cards multiplied by each other.  Games last about 15-20 minutes.

RATING: 6
Simple, unflavored two-player game of timing, cash management, and a bit of lookahead.  There are some real nip and tuck situations in which both players are delaying looking to avoid setting the other guy up for a good score.  You could call it zugzwang, I guess, but I think it's central to the appeal of the game.  I can see Combit being a very enjoyable game for children in particular, who might get a kick out of figuring out the math behind the game.  It definitely resembles Sackson's Buried Treasure, but I think Combit is much better.

For such a simple game (and a breeze to teach), this game has enough strategy and tough decisions to keep me interested. My wife isn't as calculating as I am, so I tend to win most of our games, but the simplicity here is still a draw for her. Not my favorite 2-player filler, but bump it half a point for being so simple. That really is a plus in my book for a game like this.

Mar09: Solidly okay.  Maybe I was hoping for too much.  Maybe I just need to try it again a few times.

The math does work out well.  It does turn into a game of chicken, and there are some decisions.  Maybe I was just disappointed because on 60% of my turns the "correct" move was pretty obvious.  Even squeezing in 10ish tough choices in a 10 minute game is an accomplishment though.

It's not Lost Cities or Battle Line, but it was enjoyable.

Perhaps the Gamewright game I like the most :D. It is a quick filler. It has simple rules and it plays quickly and I feel the game has a lot more depth than you would think due to the art and publisher. 

For now, I would play it again but this is a game I would not like to play too often. Still I want to buy it, the game is simple and nice enough to play with my non-gamer friends and family.

I consider this one of the finest 2-player games available. I have played dozens of games of Lost Cities and Balloon Cup. I love them. I introduce them to everyone, but Ka-Ching! is just brilliant. You have everything on the table. It's a "perfect information" game that is so amazingly well-designed. If you want to play it hardcore, there's plenty to remember and think through and consider, but it plays extremely well by the seat-of-your-pants intuition as well. Love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very simple game that plays like a kind of reverse, two-player version of solitaire. You create 5 rows of 7 cards. The cards are valued between 2 and 6 and come in 4 colors (suits). On your turn you either buy a card or sell a pair of cards of the same color that you own. When you sell a pair, you multiply the values and take that much money. Buys have to be made from the bottom cards in each row. The meat of the game is in timing your purchases to reduce your opponent's options when their turn comes. There's a nice back and forth in this one. Light, yet engaging.

A very quick and enjoyable game, easy to teach and to understand.  I've only played it once, but it was interesting watching both your hand as well as your opponent's, trying to stall so that certain cards do not become available for purchase.  I'd like to try this a few more times, ideally with the same opponent - there's quite a bit of tension for such a simple game system.

A nice filler for two. Combit is a quite abstract cardgame, but it has a nice game-mechanic. Only 35 cards (plus 2 jokers and several moneycards) but still there are a lot of tough choices! Combit tastes a little bit like Richelieu but Richelieu is boring - Combit is not. It's odd that this game is not well-known. Unfortunately Combit can be boring game if other player is not as good as the other one. That's why I sold my copy...

Kind of a provisional rating so far, since I've only played it with my kid. I bought it with the thought of reinforcing some math skills. It certainly does that, though I wish the card values went up to 9 or greater for even more multiplication practice. 

However, I can see there's also an interesting game in there for adults, too, due to the open information and importance of timing in your plays. Even control over the game's pace--a sprint game where both players trigger the endgame as soon as possible, or a battle of attrition that draws it all the way out. Kind of like Lost Cities, in that respect. I'm looking forward to playing it with adults.

Cute and fast, but even so, if I take 20 seconds to make a decision, I feel all the eyes of the world watching my analysis paralysis.  I don't see why this couldn't've been multi-player.

A game of chicken, trying to put off revealing a great card for your opponent to buy for as long as possible, and timing the reveal for when your opponent can't take advantage of it or you can set it up so it benefits you more a turn or three down the line. Lots of fun, glad I spotted it on a geeklist.

This game seems "solved" in that there's a clear best-move each turn, and the only choice is between that clear best-move and other sub-par moves. Leaves very little strategy.

the rating is for a kids game. I have an elementary school kid and it is good for multiplication, making change, etc., but with a little bit of strategy.  Nice little game.

Nice quick and gets you thinking without straining the brain. An excellent lunch time game. I would like to try the multiplayer version - traders, but it's a little hard to come by. Sure this has no theme, but it's enjoyable just for what it is.

Ka-Ching! (formerly Combit, now re-released as Trader) is a very simple set collection game. The cards are dealt into a 5 column tableau from which only the bottom card of each column is available for purchase. The object is to collect pairs of like-coloured cards whose product is as high as possible, while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Overlaying this set collection system is a tight economic game where you will occasionally be forced to cash in pairs of cards to help finance future purchases. It's a tense, highly tactical game, that still rewards forward planning. I enjoyed it more than I expected I would; in general, I'm not a fan of fillers. This is one I will buy.

Fast and fun. If you can add, multiply single digit numbers, and recognize colors, you can play this game. It's incredibly simple in execution but requires at least a bit of tactics. I think if this had been a Kosmos two-player game with some more serious bits, a useless board, and perhaps some optional rules, it would have been a much bigger hit. Good solid game.

RATING: 6.2
Since I'm a mathy kind of guy, I kinda liked this.  There's a little press-your-luck element in sometimes buying a card and hoping to get a good match for a nice payoff, but overall, it doesn't have quite the depth even for what it is to get a higher rating.  At least the play is really short.

Fun, quick game.  Some tough decisions because you're always simultaneously playing offense and defense.  Easy to teach and highly portable.  Great for kids.  Two-player only.

[Winning Moves 'Combit' 2001 edition] {Couple, kid, abstract; mathematical, economic} Combit is an abstract mathematic game.  Though it involves many calculations, it's fun and fast. It is especially good for college students. It's a tense game, esp. when 2 players are of similar intelligence.

The rule is simple and elegant. It's a tactical game with no luck. It's quite unforgiving because a game is short; there are not enough cards or time to catch up. The first player may have a little advantage; thus, it's better to play Combit with 2 hands so that each player leads once. Usually, players are trying to delay take cards from certain column so that the high value cards would not be exposed.  However, this is constrained by the cash a player has; therefore, with careful calculation, a player can decide the best time to take up those cards so that the opponents cannot take up the high-value cards even though they are exposed. As a result, keeping a good cash flow is important and which increases the strategic values of the joker.

It's a pity that it only supports up to 2 players. Nevertheless, I don't think it scales well for more players.

[new edition] The new edition, Ka-Ching, from Gamewright is quite ugly for me. I am glad that I have the original German edition.

A pretty solid two-player card game that bascically comes down to timing and hand- and money-management. Players must buy a card or sell two cards of the same color every turn, and the main trick here is to keep your options flexible. If you are short of cash and must sell, your opponent might just get to buy a card you want. Similarly, if you cannot sell and are forced to buy, you may have no choice but to free up a more valuable card for your opponent. If you like this sort of "waiting game" mechanics, Ka-Ching will appeal.

Purchased 12/19/2008 - I recently read a review/session report for this little game and it sounded like fun, so I added it to my wishlist.  While at Barnes & Noble doing some Christmas shopping, I saw it there and picked it up for $10.  Can't wait to play it and glad it's strictly a 2 player game.

This game reminds me of Sid Sackson's Buried Treasure, in that you draft cards from the bottom of a collumn. I wonder if it could be made to work with more than 2 players.

This is a very good, quick two player game. There are no unknowns during play, because all the cards are face up on the table, so the game is 100% strategy.

This game is a lot more clever than the publisher and artwork would have you believe.  It's a simple buy low-sell high sort of game, with a lot of the charm coming from the way the markets are dealt out at the start of the game.  A lot of the tension comes from that market structure, as you find yourself in a position where you can take a card from a row, but it will open up a better card for your opponent.  Though the goal seems pretty straightforward, getting there requires some thinking, and knowing when to sell a set of cards for less than you really want to get for it.  Shoot, there's a chance that you'll be buying cards with no intention of selling them, because you want to be able to get to something better.  There's even a tactic of getting smaller returns to end the game faster, but the cards have to come out in the right way to pull that one off.  Also, it's probably in your best interest to hold on to cards to sell for as long as you can, since selling cards can be an effective pass to force your opponent to buy something first, but then again, you have to sell things in order to get money to buy more cards.  It plays in about 15 minutes, it has a low price point, and it has some nice choices to make.  What else do you want?

There was nothing wrong with gameplay but deciding which were the best cards to purchase was fairly obvious. There's a fair amount of basic math, but the fact that it only plays 2P and only practices multiplication facts up through 6x6 makes it a less viable option than other games I own.

As a perfectly open system, there's bound to be trouble.  A kid should always lose to an adult, unless the young prodigy is accustomed to planning weeks ahead.

There's still a lot to recommend, as I've never seen anything like it.  It would make solid kid-kid entertainment.

Gamewright's releases tend to be spectacular hits or hideous misses, and this one thankfully is on the positive side.

Played a few times. A rather pleasant filler for two players. What you want to do is obvious (get many high cards, use them in pairs, have few unplayed cards in the end), how to achieve that better than the opponent, less so. I suppose it may have some educative value regarding multiplication for children, too.

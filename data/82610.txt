I own this and 12-player Telestrations. And I actually think I might like this better than Telestrations. The word choices are definitely better in Scribblish. And writing on paper where you can easily look at a glance and see all the changes is a plus. Also you can save your sheets to look back from previous times playing. Both games are a lot of fun.

Hasbro's take on Eat poop you cat. Game is excellent, but some of the additional rules are useless. I suggest throwing out the timer unless you have REALLY SLOW PLAYERS. Oh and dont even bother counting points. Who cares really ?

I own two boxes to play up to 12 players.

Not much to this game but it's an easier sell for non-gamers than Eat Poop You Cat. 

Update: I don't bother with the scoring mechanism (we just try to guess which was our original). I also don't follow the die rolls for passing the sheets around exactly as rolled.  Instead we only pass once or twice to the left and  mix things up near the end. Played this way I'd rate it an 7.

RATING: 5.2
Can be fun, although I suspect Telestrations is better.  Do not use the dice, pass around the circle and then get each original author to score a point for best picture and best caption.

RATING: 1
There is honestly no reason to get this over just using whatever paper you have handy except for the convenient strips of paper they give you and the little plastic things that help you easily scroll your drawings/captions and hide them. 

The dice rolling mechanic is silly and redundant, and passing it to the left every turn ensures much better results as people will otherwise get the same sheets over and over.

Trying to add a points system to Eat Poop You Cat is just a little ridiculous, and kind of takes away from the actual game. I wouldn't get this game again.

Absolutely hilarious game...BUT, only if you play with 7 plus players. (which technically requires and other version of the game or additional plastic scrolls)
Less than 7 players the effect is lost and drawings become predictable.

A very light, mostly laugh inducing family game that the kids LOVE.

RATING: 8
There really isn`t a lot of game play here ,but as a
social activity it stands out. Everybody can scribble
out a drawing even if it ain`t a Mona Lisa. Which is
good because the fun comes from seeing the hopeless 
pictures produced and the total mix up that follows
from text to drawing to text to drawing etc.. Played
a 5 player game where one of the girls was 11 years old.
At the end of the game one of the drawings made her laugh
so hard and long that we almost thought she was going into cardiac arrest. Naturally we laughed as much as her
since her laughter was so contagious. Would highly recommend this activity , just drop the scoring and let the good times scribble.

RATING: 8
Soooo I am fairly sure no other game has made me laugh as hard as Scribblish has.  We never played the game based on the rules. We all just pass the papers one direction and then figure out which we think are ours at the end. We then show and read each of the papers.  I like it better than Telestrations because I keep all of the papers and can go back years later and read them again and have the same laugh.  Its a fun social group game.

Added to the injury of having to draw is the insult of those drawings being laughed at. This game is what I imagine Telestrations to be like, although I haven't played it. If you enjoy this sort of thing, you'll forgive the unhandy card readers, and you'll forgive and ignore the prescribed way to pass the readers around. The scoring ... Oh, never mind ... will anyone actually bother to keep score? At least I can play this instead of Pictionary when the drawers in the group show up.

RATING: 7
Used to play this one with the family a lot using house rules. No die, just pass clockwise until the paper is done. It was always a hit.
While Telestrations is the better executed game, this one is worth it only for the cards. Rather than a single word, people are given complete sentences which seem to have been written specifically so that they will go in strange directions.

Scribblish is essentially Eat Poop You Cat with training wheels for less imaginative players.  The paper treaders included with the game are irritating to work with, and the scoring system is much too complex for such a simple premise.

RATING: 2
Overly produced version of eat poop you cat/telestrations.  Biggest problem I have with this implementation is that it only handles up to 6 people and really needs to handle up to 8 or 10 as this is really a party activity, not a game.

Don't recommend with any less than 6 players.

I echo Dan Blum's comments above. Telestrations has made me cry tears of laughter. Scribblish is just sad. And the whole faux-wacky graphic design of the Cranium brand arouses nothing but feelings of cynicism in me.

This is broken.  There's no hope of guessing the phrases written on the cards, the distribution of the scrolls by shuffling them up means that people are very likely to see the same thread more than once, and the scoring is silly.  Instead, I recommend the far superior Telestrations. (1 play)

Got this as a gift and it's actually really fun. Had a really good laugh with this one, making it a great choice for a party game.  Scoring is rough...best just to play for the fun of it (making it more of a social activity than a game).  Can't see playing this without at least six players but think it would be best with eight.

I like this much more than Cranium, but not enough to want to play it again.  Players alternate writing captions for other players' drawings, and creating drawings to illustrate other players' captions.  It's more or less a visual version of "telephone."  The results can be quite funny, and I suppose it is a good party game, but it's just not my cup of tea. (2+3)

RATING: 3
This game has the same basic idea as Telestrations, but replaces the fun and hilarity with confusion and brokenness.  Because of the random passing, players often got phrases that they've already seen, making trying to guess or draw it, well, dumb.  The large dry-erase flipbooks from Telestrations have been replaced by smaller pieces of paper that feed into a clumsy plastic thing.  Yay, trash!  It also only plays with up to 6, which I would consider the minimum number of this type of game.  The phrases included in the game may or may not be better than the single words in Telestrations, but I couldn't get past the other problems with the game.

Eat Poop You Cat in a box. 

You roll a die to see who you pass your chain to. This can result in you getting a chain back so soon you recognize it. I'll probably end up playing without the die in the future. 

The little plastic "rollers" allow you to play this game in a living room without a table and prevents accidentally seeing previous drawings/sentences. 

The timer is pointless - we couldn't tell when time was up. 

The starter sentences make the game accessible to those leery about being creative on the spot. 

The voting at the end to see if you can recognize your starting sentence based solely on the final drawing, as well as rewarding funny entries, makes Scribblish into an actual game, rather than just an activity.

RATING: 7
This can be a very fun/funny game as long as you don't follow the rules. It helps to have some people in your group who aren't the brightest stars in the sky and some really horrible artists. A lot of the hilarity disappears when people draw too precisely. 

My tips include: it's best with the maximum amount of people. forget the dice. always pass to the left except when you're 1 or 2 away from the end, it helps to pass 2 to the left so you don't end up with your own. 
the timer is useless. it makes a series of seemingly random sounds. we couldn't figure out when the timer was over. grab a timer from another game or use your phone/watch. 
don't keep points to keep the game light and imaginative. 

I see some complaints about having to use the slips of paper, originally I thought it was such a hassle and trash builder, but we've created some very funny strips that we get to save.

Would be phenomenal as an 8-player game, where you would be unlikely to see the same device twice. As a 4-player game, you're guaranteed to get some repeats, which totally defeats the purpose of the game.

This was interesting. kind of like telephone meets pictionary. draw a picture of some really random & strange event from the card. at the end, you can only see what the picture has become in the end & you have to guess which one was your original picture.

Don't play the "competitive" version. This game doesn't need winning conditions, the scoring and dice rolling is garbage. Just get enough people together and pass the sentences and pictures around the circle.

RATING: 3
It's really impressive how the designers managed to take a perfectly decent activity - which CAN be made into a decent game, since Telestrations exists - and ruin it so thoroughly. The plastic doohickeys are hard to use. More importantly, the game structure is awful. The scoring system - such as it is - requires that no one knows who started which sheet. If the scramble side never gets rolled, then this won't work at all. If it does, there's an excellent chance someone will get the same sheet twice - possibly even right away, which also doesn't work.

Most people rating this highly seem to be ignoring the plastic scroll things and the actual rules, instead just using the cards to "play" Eat Poop You Cat. Which is fine, but it's not a rating of the GAME, it's a rating of a repurposing of some of the equipment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Scribblish is a drawing/caption game where each iteration causes the original meaning to be lost/corrupted.  Once the drawing/caption roll is full, each player guesses which was originally their own.  Scribblish is a GREAT game and leads to all sorts of laughter & teasing by all involved.  Points are also received by having the funniest drawing/caption, so players attempt to insert humour whenever possible.

Unfortunately, there are only 6 plastic roll holders (that the drawing/caption papers are loaded into) included with the game.  This is annoying because the game becomes even better with additional players.  Also a problem is that the original descriptions can become repetitive.

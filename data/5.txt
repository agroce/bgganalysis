I really enjoy this semi-abstract economic game, and I have the fancy-pants edition which looks really nice.  Only complaint is the randomness of the tiles: it is easy to get screwed or have someone run away with it based on the tiles drawn.

Great game. Plays best with more than 3 players. What I love about it is the fact that while strategy is involved, it requires you to watch every play. You're constantly trying to guess who has the most stock in the other companies.

My only complaint about the game is that if one person can manage to get a sizeable amount of money when the other players are broke, then they can usually pull off the win. Other than that though, super awesome game!

Golden oldie of a game. It has plenty of virtues but the main problem is that there's no way to intentionally stop the leader. A couple of lucky early mergers with majority holdings and your pretty much untouchable while the other players scrape to get by. Best played with players of even abilities. Regardless, it's a fun, abstract game to play.

Acquire is a classic game that unlike many has stood the test of time effectively. There's no theme to speak of (unless buying and merging hotel chains is your jam), the component quality is shoddy, and the core mechanic of the game (drawing new tiles) is entirely based on luck. So why is it so highly regarded?

For one thing, it's so much better than its competition. Other games from the 1960s were even worse, so Acquire stands out even today simply because of its company. If this game were launched amidst the Terra Mysticas, Puerto Ricos, and Pandemics of today it might not be noticed. But as it is, it stands out. 

Secondly, Acquire presents you with meaningful decisions. The hidden money and stocks mean that you have to keep track of other players' positions as you play, and expand and merge the hotel chains accordingly. Though there is luck in drawing each tile, the fact that you have six of them at a time means that you very rarely have nothing useful to play. 

The genius of Acquire rests in its bonus system. When a hotel chain is subsumed into another chain, a bonus is awarded for the player who has the most stock in that company. Additionally, bonuses are recorded at the end of the game as well. This makes merging chains a strategic decision that carries a lot of weight for you and every other player. Often, a skilled player can ride a wave of mergers to a dominant position in the largest remaining hotel chain at the end of the game, and cruise to victory on his bonuses. 

This is why Acquire is so great: there's a great deal of tense thought that goes into every tile placed. It's a harsh and unforgiving game that rewards players with a good memory, and penalizes those who play carelessly. This type of game isn't for everyone (it definitely isn't for my wife) but it will always have a place in my collection because there's not really anything out there that has replaced it yet.

You can fuggedaboutit when it comes to theme, but Acquire still represents one of the best of 3M's bookshelf series, and it's rightly considered a classic. This mind game will have you blocking and maneuvering other players to come out the richest.

Very clever game, and not as luck-driven as you might think. While I have only played a handful of games, the first game seemed to indicate that it is too chaotic with 6 players. 4 players is probably the sweet spot.

A Sid Sackson classic. A little bit counter-intuitive regarding stock and mergers, but if you overlook how it breaks some of the rules of how business in the real world is conducted (it is a game, after all), it's a mighty fine game.

Retro gaming at its finest.  I may have more plays of this than any other game - might be a toss up with old school Cosmic Encounter. A tight, tight game when playing with experienced opponents.  Crushing heart-breaking mergers, lol.  Nothing better than getting a majority shareholder position when your primary opponent has lost track, haha.

I really like Acquire. I used to play a 4-players version on my Palm Pilot. The rules are easy to learn and despite the tile drawing aspect, there is really a skill to gain on that game: which tiles to play or to retain? Where to play on the board? What to buy? When? Sure, you're getting a huge advantage in being able to gain money early in the game and that first move is giving you a strong momentum that opponents may have difficulties to recover. Still, I find the game very nice: I like the tile-laying aspect as well as the majority aspect of it. I wish it was as renowned as Monopoly is today.

Acquire is fun to play.  I like how companies merge.  There's this interesting line you need to tread between  buying the right shares and knowing when to pull out and take profits.

Acquire is fairly light and simple, but it's engaging and there's enough hidden information and complexity in what other people hold to make competing for first place in a company fun.

I got this off e-bay for a small fortune. It's pretty mathy which is a negative for me. There feels like an optimal choice with every tile, but I can rarely see it. I do like the game and I appreciate that it is a classic - but it has a 'sameness' to it after a few plays. I think I'm going to move it to the trade pile.

Acquire is themed as an economy/market speculation game. However, this description does not fit. It is a tile placement game and you speculate which entities stay on the board the longest and grow the most. 

You could kind of expect that a game from 60's would not provide any real decision but this is not the case here. Players are given a number of tiles to form a personal stack and the contents is for their private information only. Thus you can make some educated guesses which "companies" will grow, and critical tiles give you even some control over the game.

This speculation is really the meat of the game. Tactical decisions and correctly timed moves serve as garnish. You cannot really follow any great strategies since the tiles you draw dictate the possibilities you have. So the game falls at the tactical end of the spectrum and as such it is a notable one.

This rating is based on a first play, but I like what I saw.  There's lots of strategy and tactics and the luck element allows for a huge amount of replayability.  The placement of pieces in Manhattan obviously owes a little bit (no mor than that) to this game.

My wife loves to hate this game, but it's always a hit with visitors. The strategy is somewhat counter-intuitive, so people almost always want to play it again after their first time. It might initially seem like there is a lot of luck involved, but the strategy required to play well makes it challenging. That is probably one of the main reasons this game has been around for so long! If you can remember who has what (and how many) cards and accurately foresee how mergers might happen, you might not find yourself penniless for too long.

I played this game a couple of times growing up and recall enjoying it, and then was given my own copy of the game as a present several years ago.  I only just punched the chits out some 4-5 years after it was added to my collection.  

It is a fine game, but just not as compelling as many of the modern Eurogames out there, so I expect it will continue to collect dust.

Ultimately donated to a good cause.

An absolute classic. Fun to re-theme. Prefer old 3M editions though, no idea why Hasbro and Avalon Hill feel the need to change the board size and game parameters, and add bonuses. You don't play a game like this cause you want it "funner" or simpler.

As far as the components, the latest Hasbro/Avalon Hill is a travesty. Not surprised it's being blown out on eBay right now LOL

I'm looking for an old 3M copy, from which I will make my own luxe components, variant rules, and rethemed cards, boards, pieces.

A classic stock game. You are building hotel chains, merging with other companies, and buying and selling stock in an attempt to make the most money. This is the game monopoly should have been. It's influence on my appreciation of stock games is significant as one of my earliest exposures to the mechanic in games and can be seen in other great games I own like airlines Europe and imperial. This game rarely gets to the table with my gaming friends now as more sophisticated games have displaced it but I am always happy to get it out for the casual crowd as it is still a solid "gateway" game.

The last few times i've played there has been a tendancy for one player to be completely out of the game through not getting in on an early deal or players being forced to create mergers that help others more than themselves to get some cash flow going. 

I like the idea of the game but the randomness of the tiles plays too big a factor for my liking and it doesn't feel like there are enough decision points or opportunities to twist the game; it's a bit too long to play out to decide who wins when you usually know half way through the game.

My favorite game.  Not really a finance game either - deals with stocks/majorities/mergers, but that's just the theme.  Might turn some people off, but if you can get around that, it's a really intense game of short-term gain vs. long term gains.  In 4-6 player games 1-2 people will get shafted and the first merger is very important.  Works best with 3 players, maybe 4 at most.  But if you run out of money it's usually your fault as there are layers of tiles you shouldn't play.  And most games you won't have a merger before you place a new company.

A great game with simple rules that works with even newer gamers and also works if people do not wish to negotiate in the game or do, although I feel the game is much more fun doing so. The rules are simple yet very satisfying in terms of strategy and logic to when to hedge into many hotel's shares or horde one hotel's shares, given the imperfect information presented to one. The Game is also short and sweet at about a hour plus.
Downside is thematically there is some things that don't work like the real market but overall the theme still comes through and the older edition's 3D plastic pieces seem much more sought after than the current cardboard version out there. 
Overall, I do enjoy the game and can say it will work in more than just one particular type of group.

I suppose if I'd played this back in its heyday, I would have thought it was great, but I missed out.

1st play: I absolutely underestimated this game. The pacing is excellent, tense decisions abound and this may be Sackson's best game. I can understand why it's been around so long and reprinted so many times. Can't wait to play again.

2nd play: A solid game the second time around. I debated whether it was worth a 7 or an 8, but then I realized the game played in 70 minutes, start to finish. If it were a 90-120 minute game, I think it would be a 7, but packing so much game into such a short time period pushes it just slightly up to the low 8 range.

RATING: N/A
This game is really nothing to look at. In fact, and some people are likely to become a little defensive about this, it has dated badly. Of course the layout makes sense, but it isn't attractive, and paper money is a problem nearly every time. 

Mechanically, this is one of those games that does one thing really well. Unfortunately it only does one thing. 
The approach it has to 'investment' is undeniably clever, and offers some real-world connection. 

Dynamically, shifting values and notions of how to ride someone else's preferences to profit are fun. However, in this game, it's all so bare that the ugliness of the variance feels unsatisfying, rather than tense. 

Overall, I think a lot of games present the investment dynamic in a more palatable way. I don't pretend to enjoy this foundation in many games - I realised quickly I didn't like stock games - but I need at least some skin over the skeleton. 

I'D RATHER PLAY: [thing=822][/thing] at 2-3, [thing=54138][/thing] at 4-5. Carcassonne is subtly a game of investment, as long as you're playing with the Big Meeple, and Imperial 2030 is free and beyond-math enough to assimilate any player order errors at the heavier scale.

STRATEGY

Build hotels and buy equity in existing ones. Fight for the majority stake in takeovers and mergers, hostile or otherwise. A good game!

There can be some amount of downtime between turns. The negative effect of this (possibly disengagement from the game) can be minimized by reducing distractions, like resisting one's cellphone and not talking to someone who isn't playing the game.

Recommended with 3-6 players (best 4). 90 mins.

A very good and simple buy and sell game that is easily accessible by both young and old. The strategy is limited by the tiles and the number of players thus in that sense, it’s deemed as chaotic.

I think this game is about as mechanically sound as you can get hence the high rating. But, while I enjoy it, I never really go out of my way to suggest it. I bring it to game nights because it's simple, supports many players, and nobody dislikes it. I do enjoy playing against AI from time to time on GTO (for free).

Playing with any assets hidden is pointless since you can track them. The random tile draw and hand management is enough hidden information for this game. I guess if you like making uninformed decisions in a game that already has a significant random element knock yourself out with "hidden" info.

update: I recently played in what may have been the best game of Acquire I've personally witnessed. First through fourth were separated by a mere $4K and I only won by $300. I did this by making sure I retained some cash on hand even when my majorities were being threatened. This game really solidified my opinion that Acquire is a very demanding game in regards to management of cash. Don't spend all your money until you have an absolute sure thing. 

Yes, there's a luck element and no, you can't negate it. But you can really help yourself by following one simple rule:

DON'T SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY

update: lowered to 7 due to becoming more interested in no-luck economic games of higher complexity like Chicago Express, Imperial, and 18xx. I still think it's a great game and very newbie friendly but I'd almost always rather play a heavier game in the right company. This is excellent lighter fare, however.

Classic but a little dry for the mainstream. None of the post-Bookcase Edition versions have been improvements although naming a chain after Sackson is a touch of class..

Regarding Hasbro's 2016 version: The smaller game board means a few more mergers and the new payoff schedule means more money will be in play for the participants. The production, however, leaves something to be desired. The spaces should have their names painted as with other editions. There is not enough play money for the final payoffs. There is no excuse for that.

Well, Monopoly and Scrabble had a one night stand and gave us Acquire!

No, well actually it's a totally different beast, but it IS a business game that uses tiles on a grid as some form of abstractified business positioning and growth indicator - odd thematically but in practice it is perfectly easy to follow through.

When two companies meet, the one that get swallowed up is the smaller of the two - and the owners of shares in that company are the people who make money.

An excellent change from the norm, and decades ahead of the curve.

I've been playing this for years. It used to be an innovative game but lately has become a bit dated. The income distribution early on can be brutal. A player or two can be essentially out of the game through no fault of their own. But it is a good solid economic game. I think there are variants out there that will help with the early game income problems that occasionally crop up. Overall though this is one of those game that everyone should play. In terms of just number of versions and the history of the game in publication this one rivals any game.

Acquire is a game of fun and fortune for 2 to 6 players. High adventure in the world of finance.
All it takes is a little luck - and a lot of strategy. Each player builds and strategically manipulates vast, profitable hotel chains.  Grow your hotel chains, invest in them, then merge them in order to collect the stock bonuses. Shrewdly buying the right stock at the right time. Decide when is the best time to merge your chain of hotels. Control the stocks of your hotel chains and ensure you're the major stock holder. Invest in your opponent hotel chains in hopes to gain a majority bonus payout. Buy, Grow and Sell in a calculated race to acquire the greatest wealth.

Expected playing time is about 1.5 - 2 hours

Very interesting tile laying stock game.  You have to be careful in this one to actually not buy stock in the company that will eventually be the strongest, because you need to invest in smaller companies that will pay off when they get acquired so that you have enough money to keep up the continual investments.  Pretty neat game, and although the tile drawing is "luck", this game is not luck driven at all.

I really enjoy this game.  So much fun to see what stock people buy to guess what tiles they have.  Also need to count the amount of stock each has and predict where will an acquire happen.  Things and plan changes as tiles were laid.  Definitely one of the best game I have so far.

Fun and quick family game. My wife loves it. It is quite a abstract game, and it took some time to understand the game play and strategy.

A game of acquire is interesting at the start, and rapidly becomes less and less interesting. The random tile draw can be frustrating and it's very easy to get shut out. I still think everyone should play it at least once, because it's a great design considering it came out in the 60s, but ultimately it's overshadowed by more modern games.

I can see why it's a classic. It looks drab, perhaps, but it does exactly what it needs to do very elegantly, while also adding plenty of tension.

The auctions and everything from that are great and I do like how the only real way to get money in-game is selling, not converting, your shares during a merger. However, this does sort of possibly lead to scenarios in which players are sort of completely hamstrung (or rather, I suppose, just wait out a merger that they can participate in).

Still, as far as games within the relatively heavy share ownership auction game mechanisms go, this is a beauty in how quickly and easily it plays.

Intriguing, it drags ever so slightly, and it's annoying to have to count the number of squares a hotel is on, and ask the number of shares someone has, repeatedly-- would prefer a track on the board to record these.

Still, a clever classic, I just think Shark is slightly better and I don't need both so traded away.

I hunted around and paid a little over the top for the 1999 - Avalon Hill large box version. The one with the large plastic board and pieces

When I first bought this game I thought it was ok but nothing special. After repeated playing though it has grown on me. It isn't a game that will overwhelm you with different routes to victory and variety of game play. It has very subtle strategies that you'll refine over repeated plays. 

It's pretty easy to teach, apart from one or two rules about payouts that won't click with beginners until a merger or two has taken place. On their second playing they'll have it down no trouble at all. 

I must say even though I haven't played any other version of this game so I could be wrong, I have a feeling that the set I bought (through its aesthetics) contributes to the gaming experience more than it should for me. I'm not sure I'd have the same feelings for this game if I were playing on a cardboard set with cardboard companies, as seen in the recent edition.

RATING: 9
The king of all financial management games Acquire is deceptive in its play. Strategy is truly wedded to the market, NOT in the firm way people can read a wargamers mapboard, but in the player&#039;s perception of that market.
It&#039;s all about anticipation based on imcomplete information, like the &quot;real world&quot;. From there the game allows for a variety of strategic approaches akin to investing strategies: you can be a risk-taker or risk-averse. You can play the market or hold pat.
The only con to the game is players, especially late in the game, can bog down trying to get optimal placement and results.
So what? it&#039;s called &quot;maximizing your return on investment&quot;!

Used to play this when I was much younger and it went into my parents closets to be forgotten.  They found it and delivered it to me, complete with all our scoresheets from decades ago.  Played it for old times sake and it was interesting.  However, I think in my memories it was so much better.  Not a bad game by any means, but the components (i.e. paper money) leave a bit to be desired.  I know there are newer versions with more splash and color, but I kinda like the old school elements of this.  Just not sure if this will hit the table much.

Avalon Hill is the game king!  This is a 1 hour game that is so addictive, that it should be illegal.  Actually, I heard that it is illegal in South Dakota and Idaho and maybe Montana.

Played the Hasbro/Avalon Hill version.  Was pretty fun, a lot of strategy with a fairly minimal amount of luck.  The draw of tiles can probably screw you over pretty hard, but I'd think it'd balance out pretty well over the course of a game.

Pretty simple to learn and play, but not really deep enough for my tastes.  I'd play it again though.

*) Simple and clever idea

*) Often loses tension in the end, when it's clear which corporations will survive, and which will be swallowed up.

Some heavy luck elements with the tile drawing, but that doesn't stop me from really liking this game.  My paper money game of choice.  I don't see many good comebacks though.  Most of the time you will know who is still in the race for first by mid game once a major chain takes off.  After that, it sometimes has a habit of playing itself.  Still, there is lots of room for bold moves and wild stock speculation, which keeps it tense if you can stay among the contenders.

This was one of the first games I bought my husband after we started getting interested in boardgames.  While I think he really likes it, I don't find the theme or mechanics very engaging.  It's a pretty easy game to teach to non-gamers because the rules are fairly straightforward.

A classic game worthy of its reputation.  Easy to teach and play, but affording the players plenty of replay opportunity.  Only drawback is the random tile draw.  It is not a fatal flaw, but can sometimes cause players to think that their strategy and success depends on drawing a specific tile at the right time.  Plays best with 4+. [GTI Code: TGSD]

9/4/17: No catch-up mechanism, and it is possible to be in a situation where you don't get to participate in mergers and you get left in the dust.  Fortunately it's a short enough game that this doesn't last long.

6/11/16: A little chaotic with 5.  I would think that with 6 you would have little to no control.


A fun lighter game that has been around a long time.  The last Avalon Hill/Hasbro version has some great eye candy appeal.  You need to manage your money well and being stuck on the sidelines with stock and no cash while mergers happen around you can seriously suck the fun out of the game.  A little light on theme.  I enjoy playing this, but it is not as rewarding to me as other games.  

Growing up we played a variant known as the "John Smith" variant.  The name has been changed to protect those who were found guilty in a court of law.  This variant was based on the life and times of my mother's stockbroker.  In this variant you place one blank spare chit in the draw pile. (My edition came with spares.)  When drawn, you can use this chit at any time by placing it on a competitors chain.  With the chit placed, players have one round to add to that chain of hotels.  If the chain is not expanded during the round it burns down on the placing players next turn and is removed from the board.  This can lead to an anxious round if no chits have been kept in reserve and other players don't have enough stock in a chain to want to save it.  In real life the chain in question was a Bobby McGee's restaurant, and yes, my mom did switch stockbrokers after this.  The "John Smith" arson variant rule did much to add to the enjoyment of our games.

7/19/10: These are comments exclusively for the 1995 Flat box version.  It's flashier, but made of cardboard.  I prefer either the older version with the plastic tiles, or the newer 1999 version with the great plastic bits.

The rule tweaks between this and the 2008 edition are not trivial. For example, shrinking the safe corporation size and adding a tertiary shareholder bonus. It will take more plays to evaluate these changes.

I was quite disappointed with the component quality. The tile bag isn't big enough. The board coordinates are impossible to read. The tile and board coordinates use a stylized font that isn't very clear. There are 2 corporations with very similar colors. The player aids are a bit worse, missing a couple reminders (e.g. safe corporation size).

套利是個適合 5 人左右(遊玩人數為 3 ~ 6 人) 的遊戲，遊戲時間大約是 80 分鐘。

玩家藉由放下手上有編號的板塊，進行下列動作：
1. 成立新的企業 (連續兩個以上相連的板塊，且不屬於任一企業)、
2. 合併企業 (當兩個企業的板塊相接起來時，板塊少的被板塊大的併購)、
3. 擴大企業

遊戲的訣竅在於如何變現你手上的股票。因為玩家的現金有限，且購買的股票是不能賣出的。玩家必須想辦法讓某家企業被併購，然後把手上該家企業的股票換成現金。由於持股最多的玩家們可以獲得而外的獎金，所以要設計好如何讓自己成為併購案中獲利最多的人。

I finally got to try this classic, and although the rules made it sound tremendously fun, the actual game isn't.  The tile placement restrictions leave a lot of your success up to chance.  Sure, there are some moves you can plan for, but after players place their "useful" tiles they are at the mercy of whatever they randomly draw.  Furthermore, players can be hurt very early in the game by not being part of the first few successful mergers.

Additionally, there are times during the endgame when your only legal move will be to play a tile that helps a company you have very few shares in, thus pushing your opponents even closer to victory.  The math-heavy "collect a ton of money at the end of the game" portion felt very anticlimactic as well.

For a game this old, something is impressive about how it still holds up to modern games.  The premise is simple, the rules are eloquent, and the decision space is wide as players need to consider other players, their motives, and capabilities.

Played with 5 people and it was fun.  Yeah, there is quite a bit of luck in this game but it is still enjoyable.  Will scour BGG for rules to see if the rules from wikipedia that was in the box accurate.  Will play more to get a better feel of the game to rate.  For now it certainly is enjoyable and will play again.

Update: 6-23-07
I have been enjoying my games so far.  I have been playing with standard rules so far and it has been fine.  However, I think the game might be a bit flawed that there is a run away leader.  If you are the few people to have the first mergers payout, you have a very big head start investing in other companies to further increase your wealth.  Being stuck without money early on is very rough.  I am still unsure about this game.  It is a solid game but we'll see how it goes with more plays.

Wow, this game is 50 years old! Sid Sackson was obviously a time traveler!

This is truly a modern and ingenious design, and after having played this classic I finally begin to understand why Sackson is considered the father of the euro games genre...

The rules are so elegantly simple, but the gameplay so rich and engaging... Sometimes luck can decide the outcome of a game, but usually skillful play is the main factor that leads to victory.
A true classic, that can be played with the family or among gamers, and that I absolutely need to play more!

One of my few 10 ratings. I will never pass up a play of Acquire. It is the game that got me hooked on boardgaming. Sometimes you may have an off night, but when you have a great night...like when everyone is out of money, you start the last chain (preferably Continental) and then merge before folks can react. That's priceless.

Next time I'll write down all the stock purchases (or just play with the stocks face up).  Otherwise good play relies too much on memory for my tastes.  The game relies upon the limit of three stocks that may be purchased on a given turn, and the way players can run out of money waiting for a merger.  Tile play seems obvious and is highly constrained by random chance, of course.  Therefore, the heart of the game is which three stocks to buy each turn...not quite enough choice for me in a game lasting 30-60 min.

The random tile draw usually decides the game.  The first player(s) to profit from a merger, usually control the game and runaway with it.  That being said, Acquire is mostly fun for the beginning and middle rounds.  However, I sometimes really dislike the last couple of turns.  If there is no longer any "good" stock available, all you do is place a tile that usually doesn't do anything interesting.

This game is so simple and yet very engaging.  There can be tough decisions to make, especially concerning where to build, whether or not to merge and what stocks to buy.

Complete. More of a players copy, rather than a collectors copy. Outer box has an irregular 2x2" tear near the chest of the gentleman on the front. Worn corners and edges exist as well. The inner box has one split corner, and the long edge that it's attached to was more than 50% pulled off. Both have been repaired.
It is missing 4 information cards, and the two that are there definitely look used. However, cash looks good and nearly new.

One Luxor and one Continental stock card are definitely not original. The Continental one not even fully printed out, missing the left 33% of the image.

This is the copy where the hotel chain tiles are without the imprinted letters on them.

The stocks also feel thinner in this edition than others I've played. There is an extra stock card for both Festival and American chains.

Traded away during GameStorm 19 math trade.

RATING: N/A
9/17/16  Treasures (6)  Box is solid with negligible shelf wear.  Inner box is pristine.  From the lack of handling evidence on the stock certificates and cash, I'd say the game was maybe played once, if that.  Board is the olive-y colored one with white print and clear plastic laminate.  Everything is complete and in super shape.

Traded away during GameStorm 19 math trade.

Only played this twice, but was very impressed by it.  Surprised by how interesting a game can be created from such a simple rule set.

I created a set of this game fashioned out of pieces harvested from a copy of "Epic Duels" and a deck of playing cards that I've dubbed "Ghetto Galactic Acquire."  One day it might be nice to own the real thing...

3M 1962 Edition. Nearly new condition. I really like this game. Always want to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I bought this version with hopes that it would be more visually appealing to my family and friends who don't want to play my 1968 version. Although I'm very disappointed in the production of this reprint, it may just do the trick. The game is the same, the major difference is the components. 

The stocks are now on durable cards instead of thin cardstock. The hotel chains are nicely done in color. The tiles are just large grey cardboard chits to cover the black board - very unexciting. My main complaint is the tile (chit) holders. The tiles can't stand up on their own like the old tiles, so they created a stand out of cardboard that is ugly and flimsy. 

I finally "acquired" the Hasbro version with the plastic hotel pieces. No point in holding onto this lesser version. TRADED.

I have custody of this game indefinately.  My friend Heather played it growing up, and bought a copy recently.  We play it a few times a year, and I used to hate it because it is too Euro for me, but it has become a fun event.  Another friend, Ryan, plays with the most "creative" of strategies, and seems to win a fair amount.  By creative I mean, he has no idea what is going on, and still wins.  That irks me about the game.  Whatevas.

Great game! No wonder it has stood the test of time for going on 50 years now. Need to play again to give further comments... Updated: what a fantastic game this is!! What it lacks in components (the new AH version, that is), it makes up for in a tight economic simulation that is a real brain burner. I belive it to be best with 4 players.

Played at Tn game days, with seasoned players and one other noob to this game, we had an "unusual" game per the vets, but I enjoyed it immensely, this game has a transcendent quality that gets you in the mind set of whats going on with only presenting you a minimal amount of information, it has the effect of making you keenly aware that you are in a board game, but lets the mind wonder about all the lives of the "people" you are affecting with your decisions, a very delectable experience, not to be missed if you can help it. Its age only underscores this game as a modern classic in my view.

StockMarket, MultiOnly

You can see the roots for similar tile-laying games like T&E or Reef Encounter in play here; people complain about not being able to place a tile wherever they want to, but that's the nature of the stock market---which Acquire captures very well.  
  
The Hasbro version is stunning and a great tribute to Sackson, and even though the Sackson company is a small red one, I seem to end up using it quite a lot... 
  
I keep this game around for several reasons: I love tile-laying games of this nature, and this was one of the first; it's a Sackson classic and one of his best games; and the Hasbro production is astonshingly good.

This game is easy to learn/teach and plays in 1-2 hours. It's not my favorite game, but I'm always willing to play.

We used to play with open knowledge of stock holdings, but our last game holdings were kept secret. I feel this adds more excitement to the game.

Good game for family and friends, gamers and non-gamers.  It seems one or two random players every game have no prayer of winning, but it is not clear until mid-game who those players are this time (hint: miss the first two or three mergers and you are in trouble).  For the rest its a tense race to the finish.  I LOVE this game with 4 players.

I had always wanted to try Acquire but did not have the chance until November 2012.  I played the most recent WOTC/AH version.  Overall, I'm not a fan of the components in this edition but the game is fun and utilizes an interesting tile laying mechanic combined with a economic table mechanic.  While it isn't a "10" by today's strategy game standards, it is truly a great game for its time (first produced in 1962) and holds up very well.

Edit - This is a great game with incredible staying power - I have raised my rating to a '10' as I am always interested in playing this game.

Played this three times now. Won first two times handily. Both times I believed I was employing the best strategy I could to win. Rare that I am able to pull that off!  I can't say, however, that I enjoy this game any more than the 6 I'm giving it. Plus there's a lot of housekeeping in this game and looking share prices up in tables is never fun. I did pick up the classic blue and green 3M bookcase version of this at Thrift town for 1.99.

Strategy - 1 part cashing in through mergers and 1 part holding on to much stock of biggest companies at the end. The trick is knowing when to shift gears.

I can definitely see why this game is a classic.  It is loaded with interesting decisions.  I like how they've linked the theme with the mechanisms so well.  Watching small corporations get swallowed up by bigger companies, trying to buy stock in companies that you think will be successful, and working to be a majority stockholder are all very interesting mechanisms that work well together.  It's also intriguing how players will just spend every dollar they have in hopes that they will recoup more at a later time.

Probably my favorite part of the game is simply the short play time.  It feels like this epic economic game where you're really struggling to build these huge companies, and yet it can end sort of abruptly without warning.  I think the downside to the game is the amount of counting that can go on.  If players are trying to track how much others own of a particular stock they can freeze up in analysis-paralysis as they try to figure things out before playing.  But it's still a very intriguing game that I'm glad I own and will look forward to playing again soon.

For the age of this game the concept is beautiful. However, the random factor in tile selection (and the fact that a player could spend the entire game locked only into those stocks that they bought in the beginning) can be frustrating and evokes a feeling of helplessness. I've read about a "wildcard" tile option in a few places and I'd like to get the family to give that a try. The original yellow board with locking tiles was great! However, all of the new version are poorly produced in one fashion or another. Avoid the cardboard tile version completely. If you buy the raised/locking plastic tile version, then great for you. However, you may notice that you need to take a sharpie to the back of half or more of the tiles to avoid being able to see the letters through the backs of the tiles as you're selecting them. A great game, great concept, and good for learning how to think critically about managing your in-game stocks.

1.	Intro: This is my favorite auction game.
2.	Weight: Medium
3.	Audience: I think that this game appeals to gamers as well as beginners.
4.	Players: 6 player is the sweet spot for me
5.	Solitaire:
6.	Bits: The newest version has cheap components but it has all you need to give you a great gaming experience.  I like this game so much I found a 3M version of the game.
7.	Rules:  The rules are concise, clear and short.  If you are a moderator for the game its easy to explain in about 15 minutes.
8.	Setup:  10 minutes
10.	Game-flow: The game flow is smooth.
11.     Randomness: The only randomness in the game is tile choice.  It adds the right balance of excitement and constantly forces you to re-evaluate your strategy.  It also makes each game you play different and unscripted.
12.     Interaction:  There is good player interaction throughout the game
13.	Downtime: There is hardly any downtime and whatever downtime there is you have to use to re-evaluate your strategy because the board is constantly changing.
14.	Fun:  This game is very engaging and fun.  It requires concentration and its hard to determine who is winning until the very end.
15.	Theme:  I find that the theme is well integrated in this game.  I feel like an investor and like handling the money and the stocks.
16.	Recommendation:  This game is a solid performer in any collection.  I recommend that you try the game a few times with your gaming group and if you like it I suggest that you try and get the 3m version or if you have a tight budget then get the latest one that was produced.  This game is probably going to be liked more by men than women as the theme is very much buisness.

An OK money game; the Stock Market mechanism migh seem counter-intuitive at first. After your first merger in third place you'll understand fully.

Best stock market game I own, besides Imperial. Even though it's kind of abstract, it's a wonderful game about manipulating values of essentially neutral game components. I really like that kind of game, similar in a very distant sense to Conspiracy in that way (game components change in value based on position and player investment).

RATING: 10
Somewhat long and unforgiving, which would normally make it a must-avoid for me.  It's a classic, though, and I enjoy it more the more I play.  I love the speculation of it, the organic nature of it, and the timing considerations.  Although I find in our group it usually only comes out with 5 or 6 players, and then it's a crapshoot whether you can ever affect the timing of things.  I enjoy it with all player numbers but with a large number you're going to have a lot less control.

A staple in my collection.  I like it from 2-6 player.  I like to call this a "headrubbing" game, as you anxiously wait and wait for your turn to make your killer move before someone else ruins your plans.

Elegant rules are simple to understand, yet the depth is fathomless. An absolutely huge screw-you factor makes Acquire unsuitable for people who like to like each other while playing games, but for those who are capable of destroying their opponent's best laid plans with guiltless satisfaction there is no better game.

A good stock game, but ultimately trumped by Union Pacific.  The foremost issue with this game is the lull between the beginning of the game and the maturation and mergings of the corporations.  May also be a slight balance problem in that the longer the interim between the first and second merging, the greater the advantage garnered by the funds from the first merger.

Beautifully simple game mechanics allow for really interesting strategic play. While this game is about building companies and buying stock, it's really about competing with other players for control of companies and deciding the best way to invest your money. 

The mechanics are very simple, the decisions are rarely obvious.

RATING: 7
My group plays this a lot. Great game and really tense but cashflow management is critical to maintaining ability to influence game and it is possible to have a frustrating board position that is strong but a lack of cash means you cannot do much and are thrown on the mercy of others' tie placements and your random draw of tiles. This prevents me rating it 8 or maybe 9.

The financial system is nice, but the tile-laying part has too much luck in it. It's fun, but today there are many better games around.

The classic hotel chain stocks and shares game. The tile draw does leave you with some element of luck involved, but if you can't make a play with a tile, you can still dabble in the stock market and invest your cash in ways that can benefit you more than just laying down a random tile.

The winner of the game I played was the person who benefitted most from the first merger, there's ways to deal with that, but not that you'd get from a bunch of guys playing it for the first time! I played this a second time with most of the same players and almost the same thing happened. The person profiting most from the first merger finished second this time, countered only by a player who benefitted from the next two mergers.

Of course, the tile draws mean that the person(s) benefitting most from the early mergers are those who are lucky, or who guessed right.

This game is built to last and is evidently really well thought of here, it's just not really for me. I think there are better economic type games, so this is just an abstract really.

Once in a blue moon you can get screwed by a bad selection of tiles, but typically you have a few good options in your hand of tiles.  I think good play can overcome someone pulling a critical merger location tile.  I'm bad at games with investment options, but I still love them (Imperial, Princes of Macchu Pichu, etc.)  I don't know if my problem is specializing too much, or too little... I rarely win, yet still love to play!

Not for everyone - basically a stock market game, and the takeover rules are apparently non-intuitive for new players (you want your investments to be taken over) - but an elegant system that produces a few nervous moments as majority stakeholders are determined.
I've soured on it a bit as players involved in early mergers can get a jump on those left out resulting in a runaway leader issue.

Acquire is a classic game of stock management in which players strive to invest their starting wealth in a way that maintains their liquidity.  The "trick" to the game that is not always immediately apparent is that pretty much all investments will result in more money for the player, but certain investments will turn over faster - and it is these that are worth the most, rather than those that give the best ROI.  

Acquire is a game that must be played by anyone who calls themselves a gamer, and I recommend playing twice with the same group to really experience the game.

Played with 4 players, and its such a tight game. A real nailbiter. Specially in the end when you have a hard time placing pieces without doing mergers before you actually wants to.

I would actually consider this my gateway game. A friend and his wife introduced it to my wife and I during college, and I thought it was brilliant. It is a great game for teaching the concept of owning stock in something without actually owning or controlling the entity itself. There is good depth of strategy although seating position takes a fairly large role in the game, especially when competing for majority with one of the players to your left or right.

Just finished trading for the 1999 AH large box version and I couldn't be happier!

My wife wins most games - that makes it a winner! However, I seldom seem to get that one tile that I need. My frustration level keeps me away from further plays. It seems that that one tile you need to draw can turn the tide against you. However, a fairly solid game that keeps you engaged till the end. Played many a two player game early on in our marriage before kids...UPDATE: Probably the longest dry spell of any game in my collection with over 15 years since I can remember playing this game.

I was looking forward to trying this classic investing game and must admit I really enjoyed the experience (despite it being a six-player game, a number which supposedly makes the game very chaotic). It should not have come as a surprise given that the game has been in print for over half a century. The rules are so simple that it can possibly work as a gateway game, but at the same time, there is room for clever plays and some strategy. I would definitely love to get more plays to determine how decisive tile distribution really is, but I feel that that very randomness adds much of the underlying tension of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My 3m version of this game may be bland, but because of that I'm always impressed at the way that the theme pours out of the gameplay. I find it very slick that you are always asked to focus on your next turn, de-emphasizing the current turn, reducing any possibility of AP. Its pace is excellent but its still not exactly a rip-roaring time. Still, I love the moment of being acquired and selling off at just the right time. An example of a classic that is still great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A very good game that was ahead of its time 45 years ago! Shades of area control (through holding stocks) and hints of Tigris & Euphrates (bigger companies/kingdoms wiping out smaller ones). A real 'modern' classic.

Avalon Hill's latest edition is quite nice with the 7 different coloured buildings to represent the corporations. Very nice. Reprint it already!

Update May 2013 from Feb 2009: this was just okay after revisiting it. Downgraded from 7.5 to 6.5. Seems a bit luck dependent. If you draw tiles that can start companies and/or merge companies then you are going to do well.

As much as this game is apparently a classic, I've never had a very good experience playing it. In every game, some player has been totally booched by bad draws and has just had to wait things out. That being said, I've only ever played it with three, which may not be an optimal number...

Clever design, amazing, gripping, simple, family, game and non-zero-sum too. A contender for the top 'Spiele des Jahres' winner of winners. I recommend any gamer household always has a copy of this game in the house for visiting light weight gamers. We have both the AH bookcase (in reserve, older 'fragile' copy) and modern big box (less fragile box/rules, smarter pieces) versions.

I'm always eager to play this game with friends. You can change the rules a bit to allow trades between players, which  involves more people at all times instead of having them wait until it's their turn again.(1963 Edition, 1999 Edition, 1995 Edition, 2008 Edition).

6/29/10 - Bumping the rating from 7 to 8. After several plays, I've really come to appreciate the subtleties of this game. While there is luck involved with drawing tiles, there is surprisingly little luck involved with the game overall. It's all a matter of carefully managing your purchases. A word of warning to new players: This is definitely a game where you can take yourself out of the runnign VERY quickly. If you mis-manage your purchases (for example, by heavily investing in a remote hotel chain early in the game), you will become a spectator for the second half of the game without any chance of winning -- so be careful.

I got beaten so badly my first game (the other players had around $60k, I had only $28k) that I can't really rate it honestly. Update: I've rated it anyway, based in large part on how much the other two players (my brother and fiancee) really enjoyed feasting on me. Update2: Played again. This time I had some sense of strategy, and it turned into a tense and exhilarating affair. Also, I won! Update3: 8 -> 9. This game is just terrific -- tense, strategic, not too long. I always want to play it when I can get 3-4 people together.

RATING: 9
Great game, although you have to get past the counter-intuitive nature of the economics (thematically, the tech-stock fantasy-world 90's version may get more traction than the hotel version). Understand that the game is bascially abstract, and it's a great game.
---
EDITION NOTES, for what it's worth: generally, I think the three most common versions of Acquire are actually the nicest: the classic 3M/Avalon Hill version, with the plastic grid and tiles and iconic stocks; the overproduced 1999 "new" Avalon Hill version; and the 2008 Wizards of the Coast/AH version. These three versions are all usable, clean, graphically effective, and pleasant to play with. The old AH edition has a classic feel, while the 1999 version is overproduced but does not sacrifice function to form, and is still a playable and pleasing set. The new 2008 WotC/AH version is a good, compact, cheaper set which has usable and attractive components.

Many other sets have issues of various kinds: the Schmidt Spiele is garish and has low-quality cards instead of tiles; and the 1995 AH version comes in a freaking immense box without a commensurate increase in quality of components;

The two interlocking levels of strategy (moves on the board, and purchases of stock) make this game a fantastic challenge.  The random tile draw, meanwhile, adds just enough luck to a) make the game different every time and b) give you that "c'mon, c'mon!" feeling, hoping to get a tile that will let you close that merger you so desperately need.

Lots of fun.  Lots of tension. Can you hold out just one more turn before merging those corporations?  Or will someone beat you to it?  Oh, those darn decisions!  Add just enough randomness to not overwhelm the game with chaos and you've got yourself a game that appeals to the non-gamers and gamers alike.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Despite the game's very simple mechanics and good dose of luck, I really enjoy this one.  Really, all you do is place a tile and buy some stock on your turn, but the development of the game board and the hope that mergers will go your way really has some sort of fun quality to it for me.

I personally enjoy playing with hidden stock, which adds to the suspense when a merger happens.  I generally have a decent idea of where I stand when stock is revealed, but my memory isn't the best so it's always fun to see whether things pan out the way I thought they would.

Overall, just a fun, light stock/economic game that's surely a classic in the gaming world.

People who like thematically rich games will find this game a bit dry. I spent my childhood playing Monopoly (because nothing else was available), which was ridden with crazy dice rolls and no real strategy, and as another "money game" Acquire definitely comes in as fine replacement. Tile luck does play initial role, but its up to you to decide when to buy and when/how much to sell. Bluffing and negotiation goes a long way. Overall its a simple game that I enjoy ocasinaly.

Well, this game seems to be pretty popular in the States. Here in Germany I don't think it became anywhere that popular. Anyway, I only played it for the first time a couple of months ago and I have to say I was slightly disappointed. I had expected more. Among today's games it does not stand out. Just one of the many solid ones.

 Pity it's so abstract and with a theme pasted on. Such games rarely do much for me. And componentwise I must prefer wooden bits than plastic. Not a biggie of course. I just prefer wood to plastic and fortunately most German games have gone that way, while American games tend to be either with lots of plastic or cardboard (there I much prefer the cardboard stuff - that's where the good American stuff is to be found). Okay, enogh rambling about components...

Great economic game. I know some people find this dull and antiquated, but I think this is a tight, smooth system. 

The rules are simple enough to be a good step up from Monopoly for non-gamers, but there's enough meat here to keep hardcore gamers coming back. It manages to move at a good pace and let you make meaningful (and sometimes tense) decisions every turn.

There's a good amount of luck here, but with proper risk management and playing the odds a skilled player will mitigate much of it - the end result is a game with just enough luck to keep things fresh without being the deciding factor.

Small side note: I definitely prefer playing with closed stocks!

The perceived 1st merger advantage is really minor with experienced players. There just has to be a lot of implicit collusion with the tile play against early majority holders. Also, reflexively buying 3 shares every turn no matter what, especially in the beginning, is just poor play. 

Best with 4 IMO, as often players need to pair up on opposite sides of the board to balance the early mergers. It does take 4 or 5 plays for the game to really shine.

Meh. While I can see that it was a great game a few decades ago, I think the age really starts to show, and I personally don’t understand why it’s rated just outside the top 100. There is a lot of speculation about what the other players are going to do, which companies they will buy stocks in, when and which company will overtake another company, especially at the beginning of the game where it’s crucial to get a payout from your company – it seemed as if a big money boost at the start of the game really helps a lot going forward, so while it’s not impossible to catch up, it’s much easier to do well if you get a good start.

It’s pretty important to get good tiles. In my second game I won, but I did draw some awesome tiles which could connect some companies and I had control over what happened as well as financial control as I had the most money and shares in good companies. It’s very important to buy shares in the right companies! The final round can have a big impact on the winner as the bonus for most shares in the most expensive company is very high, at least if the game ends in the way with a company being 41+ tiles big, which is the most common (oh, and speaking of this, it’s pretty cool that you have to state that the company is 41+ tiles big or the game won’t end). Of course everybody knows this, but it still felt like a lot.

I think Acquire plays best with 4 as the stocks are in the companies are divided among those, and 5 takes too long plus you don’t have enough control about what is happening. I think 3 would definitely be too few, but I cannot say until I try it. Despite the player counts, I don’t think I have too much control over what’s happening if I don’t get great tiles and because I don’t know the tiles of the other players. Maybe I don’t know the shares either, as that depends on which rules you play by, but I think both open and hidden stocks have their pros and cons. The game has also ended in both ways, and it was interesting to see how differently the two games played out. However, I doubt I’m going to play it a lot in the future.

A classic but rather dry. I like the idea but I'm not sure how to do well at this game. I felt I had next to no control from the point at which the first two companies merged and very little  money to buy shares in order to reverse my fortunes whilst the rich got steadily richer.

After 3 plays: Forget trying to make money by manipulating share prices. This game is about rapid turnover of shares from mergers NOT long term investment. Money comes from owning the majority of shares in the smaller companies being merged. Still dry and luck dependent.

Nice stock market game. I am not a big fan of the paper money but I liked the game.

I have been looking for this game for about a year.  I remember it being in my house when I was a young kid, but it belonged to my older brother (8 years older).  Turns out he took his copy with him when he moved to Detroit, then sold it in a garage sale for cheap.  A friend knew that I wanted it desperately, and after about 2 months of constantly looking for it in various thrift stores and garage sales, found a 1968 3M Bookshelf version for me on 10/04/07.  Needless to say, I am very elated.

Haven't played it yet, but from what everyone says, this is a great game.

Edit on 11/19/07:  Finally got to play this game - twice - yesterday, and I would like to report that everything good that you may have heard about this game is very true.  There can be some tension as you wait and see if someone else will merge with the hotel chain of which you own the most shares of stock, and there is a deep level of strategy in determining when to play each of your tiles.  Overall, an excellent game.

I recommend getting this game in any manner possible.

Acquire may be a few decades old, but there's a reason it is still in print.  It is easy to learn, fun to play, and it has elements of tension that will keep it popular for years to come.  It is a bit dry for my taste, but others around me seem to really enjoy it.

There is an element of card counting that is necessary for good gameplay: one must know how many of each stock each of their opponents has.  But it isn't overly burdensome, and most players seem to enjoy doing it.

If you play according to the official rules, a player that wins the first two mergers will run away with the game.  However, the rules can be fixed making the game "perfect".  First, change the rules to never allow anyone to keep stock in a company that does not exist.  This prevents someone from leveraging their advantage to keep his/her opponents down.  Second, begin the game with approximately 12 tiles on the board, not one per player, as stated in the rules.  This greatly increases the speed at which mergers occur which also prevents someone from leveraging their early advantage to suspress his/her opponents. Third, give each player 5 tiles instead of 7.  This greatly reduces a players ability to "sit" on tiles that help their opponents - which is another way that a leader can leverage his/her advantage.  The overall result of these 3 rule changes is that the game's action is quicker and less predictable, the game will change leaders more frequently, the influence of luck is greatly reduced, and the game is much more fun.

There can be a lot of tension between turns as you watch and wait for your hotel chains to merge, grow, or stagnate.  But most of the time the tension is only there for one or two of the players while the others just plod along.

Very solid abstract-ish game.  It takes some luck to have good tiles, some strategy to decide which companies to pursue, and some negotiation or people reading skills to know when to jump on or bail out.  Plays a decent number of people.  I have the bookshelf edition, which is of course classic, but the much more colorful reprint is I think the more attractive version.

From reg edition:
(I like this game. Started playing it properly since February (missed 2-1 trade rule and initial tile placement). Definitely make the game a lot less random (though there are still elements of it). Very tactical and about picking out what others are planning and jump on board. 
Playing this again renew my interest. )

And with better bits!

Super game.  Quite a bit of luck, and quite a bit of skill.  Acquire is the kind of game that leaves you wishing "I should have bought one more share of Quantum..." long after the match.  Best with 3-4 people--never play with 2 and avoid 5-6.

RATING: N/A
Acquire has the dubious distinction of being the only game I ever traded away without playing. That doesn't mean it's a "bad" game... in fact I'm sure it's solid. I just realized I don't need to own it.

The latest Avalon Hill version is "functional," to put it politely. The theme is hard to get excited about. Plus, I own Imperial 2030, which is Acquire... but with armies!! And lastly, my friends own a copy, so when we finally get around to playing this classic, it will be their copy, and not mine.

Traded away along with Tobago and Incan Gold for Goa.

We have one of the plastic 3M versions.  It isn't much to look at, but is interesting to play.  On the tiles in our version, the letter I looks an awful lot like the number 1.  We play with 2, which uses a dummy player whose influence can be pretty frustrating.  Money is paid out for 1st and 2nd place, based on shares of stock.  The amount held by the dummy is drawn randomly, generally preventing one player from getting any money, and often reducing the leading player's bonus to 2nd place.  You have to balance your investments in small hotel chains, which give you short-term money during the game, and big powerful chains which really pay off at the end.

RATING: 6
This game is fun if your into a stock purchasing game. It's hard to long term plan as two factors work against you. The other players is the first. Naturally that is what happens in games. Other players foul up your plays. However here, especially in larger games as with 4 players, the other players actions seem to impact yours. Secondly, the tiles have a huge impact on your actions. In some cases several turns can go by with little happening due to a bad hand of tiles.

Overall, this can be a fun game, and fairly easy to learn.

RATING: 7
I liked this game for its simple rules, interesting decisions, and attractive components. I know a lot of people have been knocking the new edition, but I like it. Maybe because I've never known the older one. While this is a great light shareholding game with lots of gateway potential, I like Goldbrau better in that niche. Acquire works better with player counts other than four. A real limitation for Goldbrau. I wouldn't play this with open money, though. Too much AP, not enough game. Hidden money keeps it fun for those of us without photographic memories.

It seems like once you know how to play Acquire, you pretty much use the same strategy every game and hope you get good tiles.  It's an interesting mix of a "playing the odds" mechanic and an area majority mechanic, but a huge part of the game still rests on luck.  Just like the stock market, I guess.  Although this game is less about playing the stock market and more about investing in companies that are going to be acquired.  Thus the name...  Seems very thematic and very abstract at the same time.
Having said all that, the game is always tense and a lot of fun.

I can see why it's such a highly regarded game.  There is an interesting dynamic of buying and selling companies that is certainly enjoyable and deep enough to merit lots of play.  I do enjoy Union Pacific's take on Acquire a little more, however.  But this game, for its age, is certainly deserving of the title 'classic'.

For a game that is over 50 years old, it's amazing how well this holds up.  There is quite a bit of randomness in the tile drawing, but the outcome is still heavily driven by the decisions players make when choosing which stocks to buy and then again when choosing how many to sell/trade-in when a merger occurs.  I would compare it to Catan when considering the luck-to-skill ratio.  For some reason, I just have more fun playing this.

Downtime. Boring game. The luck of the draw is very significant. Unlike Die Macher - which still feels like a relevent game even in today's climate of board game sophistication - this game, which is heralded by many as a "classic", feels like it truly belongs in the board game universe that it was created in - namely the 1960's. It has a runaway leader problem that smacks of that time period. 

I respect the designer, but I don't plan on playing this game again.

I own the new hasbro (now old) version. The game is simple to play and teach. It is a little luck dependent, but that's what the stock market is anyway. The only complaint I have is Hasbro's inability to keep up with the "german" standards that I am used to (a.k.a. no cloth bag to hold the tiles, and really flimsy player aids) the plastic bits are nice, though.

RATING: 8
(Own hand-made Acquire 97 using Big Boss components, stored in the Terra Turrium box with Big Boss. Note rating comments below, the 8 reflects this version of the game. Standard Acquire rates a 6.)

The age of this game astounds me; for a game originally published in the 60s it has some remarkable nuances and plenty of room for skillful play. The idea behind the game is very mathy, and a little dry like most of Sackson's games, but it also is exceptional given its era. Players try to make money by placing tiles onto the board, forming corporations, causing mergers, and flipping stocks. The art of this game is timing when to invest heavily in a company, preferably before it's consumed by another (that has a few stocks left) so you can get both the majority/minority bonus, as well as a prime opportunity to cash in your stocks for even more valuable ones.

The game varies a lot based on the rules being used (open vs. closed stocks and money (I prefer open stocks and closed money. Open money is OK, closed stocks are not)) and whether you're playing the standard editions vs. the 1997 edition. The 97 edition is extremely rare (it was basically a finished game that was axed. Pre-production copies were made by Schmidt Spiele that look like professional releases for all intents and purposes, but the actual release was killed. There are only a handful of these and they sell for a mint), and fundamentally altered the board play by making 4 copies of each space, thereby giving the players more choices and control. I rate the standard Acquire at a rough 6, and find the amount of randomness that the tiles inject into the game irksome. The 97 system creates a lot of decision space that is in control of the players, which means that group think can easily lead to clusters in given areas of the board and crazy build-ups, but I like that dynamic significantly more than the "pray my tiles can be used for [i]something[/i] one from the original system.

Acquire is a classic economic game that is simple to learn and yet has plenty of strategy. Basically, you build hotels by laying square tiles next to each other, you buy stock, and then you try to collapse the hotels into bigger ones and make money. It's a good game that never gets played the same way twice. The problem is that there's too much luck involved with the tile draw and placement. And if you're broke, you twiddle your thumbs playing tiles and waiting for everyone else to control the game. Some might consider boredom to be a good punishment for players who are broke. Others do not. I fall in the latter category, which is why I only like, but do not love, Acquire.

This was one of the first games I was introduced to outside of the Monopoly and Candyland world of games. I guess it was kind of love at first sight. In most games (especially the very competitive ones) I really don't know who will end up with the most money at the end of the game. Also all of the wild money counting at the end is so stinking satisfying!!

I find the game mechanics to be unique enough that no other game quite quenches the Acquire Urge whenever it comes up for me.  The one major downside is the potential for a player to get shut out of the action mid-game if they are not aligned in any mergers and/or they too quickly spend their money. For the most part, this can be corrected with more game experience and possibly some guidance for newer players.

A classic, must-own game by Sid Sackson.  Sez you.  

After two plays I'm not convinced that it all comes down to lucky tile draws.  Yes, even more than Carcassone, because in Acquire there's only one thing you can do with any one tile.  No room for flexibility or creativity.

There's enough game there under the randomness that I'm willing to play once and a while, but it's not something I'd seek out.

The thrift store classic: two dollars, smells kind of like Grandma's house, serious looking businessman on the box.  Yet here is an awesome game.

RATING: 6
I like the concept, but it's troublesome to play with a lot of players - the game relies heavily on building momentum, and the more players there are, the less control you have over whether you ever get momentum.  All in all I'd recommend playing with 4 or fewer players.

After finally playing the game again after a many year break, I'm realizing how dated this really is. The luck of the draw on tiles is really unbearable. You need a merger to keep the cash reserves from draining, but there's often just one or two tiles necessary to force the merger in the one or two companies you actually have enough stock in to pay bonuses if they are taken over. Ugh.

Components - New - unplayed -money and cards are clean and seem unused; black area tiles have never been removed from original package.
Box - Good+ - box is intact and tight;  interior box looks almost new.  exterior sleeve has some wear to all the corners and bottom shelf edge; there is a surface tear to leading edge of backside about the size of a quarter.

A classic game about share holding and area control. The tile draw is a serious detractor for me. If I enjoyed this game more I would want to play with open money, as it is I don't really want it to drag on.

Stephenson's Rocket demoted this game significantly.

RATING: 5
Acquire turned out to be better than I expected given the game's age: more often than not oldies are pretty crappy. I liked the mechanics of increasing the value of your hotels by adding to their 'footprint', and then getting a truckload of money (or new shares) when the thing merges with a bigger hotel. Clean and simple. However, it does have some problems: the hotels are grown by what is essentially luck of the draw, and therefore mergers need not always occur when and where you want them to happen. People lucky enough to get an early lead will have more cash to spend and are thus somewhat more likely to get hold of the stock they need. While this is a rich-get-richer problem, its effect is not very pronounced: at some point it is not feasible anymore to buy stock to play catchup, so your buying power is reduced. (Of course this assumes that no interesting stock remains.) Inexperienced players will be blown away by the more experienced ones: those know that you need to create lots of small hotels to feed them to the God Hotel. And of course have plenty of stock in all of them, which is not an easy task if everyone is playing with their eyes open! 

With 6 players the luck of the draw is significantly increased but with too few players stock contention can cause significant turn angst, so I expect that there is a sweet spot in the middle at 4, perhaps 5 players. Nevertheless, Acquire was a pleasant surprise, and served as a major eye-opener as far as its heritage is concerned.

Opens stocks make for a more interesting game, less guesswork and more strategy. Never play with the optional power chips. And never play with three.

A classic game! You can always bring Acquire on the table with some new gamers - and they will love it (if they are able to love boardgames at all).

And I am thankfull to this game (among others) that showed me early on a way out of only playing monopoly and risk ...

Edit: Played it recently ... well ... I found out, that with realy new players, they can be excluded from the game for quite a while when they run out of money. I love this game ... but if I am 100% honest: many modern games have a much better flow.

Maybe I should give this a higher rating, but it just hasn't grabbed me.  I want to play some more, but I think it is just because others want to play it.  Finally came in not last (second).  Just not my type of game.  You are very limited and the decisions aren't all that great.  I really need to look at this as more of a betting game and I would enjoy it more.

Acquired Acquire in November 2007 in a trade.

Excellent game.  Instant 9 after my first play with the kids.  Played this again with some adults and enjoyed it even more.  This should be a very good stock market trainer for the kids.  Kind of long for them, so we shall see.

This game is one I enjoy quite a bit, and I see myself wanting to play this anytime someone else wants to.  

Suggestion:  I've played a couple games with the normal scoring cards and can highly recommend that people download and use the modified 100-75-50-25 payout sheets available on the Geek.  The two games I played without them suffered from a run-away leader issue after the first merger.

The key to the game is to be have your hotel chains taken over so that you have a good cash-flow. Good as an introductory game - quick enough to get two games into a session. Top game!

The first time you play it, it all seems a little strange - especially the idea that you need to be TAKEN OVER to get a good cash flow. The second time you play everything flows really smoothly.

RATING: 8
Actually I am referencing the 1976 Avalon Hill version which I own - which is very similar to the 3M 1962 version. Acquire is a really good strategy game best played with 4 or 5 players.  This is mostly a game of skill while managing the "chance" factor of tile draws.  Acquire has simple rules, is a clean game, and plays fast with little downtime.  This is also a game where the most "skilled" players tend to almost always end up in 1st, 2nd or 3rd place most every game.  My analogy is likened to Texas Hold'em poker play - sure there is randomness in each players hand draws each turn (like tile draws in Acquire), but the best players manage the "odds" for tiles, stock share acquisition, hotel mergers and most often come out on top or near the top in most games.  Where this game lacks is evident in the replayability department.  After 20 or so plays, the game tends to get shelved and only played once every year or two.  Also, players who have great memories for tracking who picked up what stocks and are good at number crunching seem to excel at Acquire, which can alienate some potential players.  Lastly, once in a while some players feel that they simply can not pull a tile chit to save their life and they then associate this to simply bad luck. With no dice, this is the only real downside to Acquire in my opinion.  All in all, I think Acquire is a superb, fun game and worthy being in any serious gamer's collection.

I love this game. One of my first board games and I still enjoy every moment that I play it. Game turn is simple. Play a tile. Buy up to 3 shares of stock. Draw a tile. The strategy and surprise in between is a lot of fun. I love it when I have the connecting tile..... It gives me insider information.

RATING: 10
Utilizes hand management of tiles that you place strategically on the board on matching coordinates in order to grow hotel chains and merge with other chains.  You buy stock in hotel chains in the hopes that they will grow, get bought out so that they give you fat bonuses in the mid-game, and ultimately your goal is to position yourself at the end with the most stock in the biggest companies at the end game.  I am relatively new to the game, but it is amazingly good. 

Your choices are: when to form a chain(and then whether it is a cheap, mid-price, or expensive chain), hand management (which tiles to place and when), what shares to buy and when, and what to do with shares of companies that are bought out in a merger (trade shares 2:1 to new owner company shares, sell for value at time of merger, or hold on in hopes of starting chain again later).

Play time: 1-2 hours.  

Would love to find the version with the plastic buildings without paying an arm and a leg. Or maybe they will finally print a modern version with decent components??? MAKE ACQUIRE GREAT AGAIN

Components: The Avalon Hill version is well-made, with sturdy, snappy stocks cards, and plastic pieces that perfectly serve their function, yet are attractive as well. I dock the game a production point because of the Monopoly-grade money and because of the poor storage inside the box (no tile racks, no draw bag, and a plastic insert that is only useful when the game is set up). I've seen some comments that disparage this version of the game; I just can't agree; I love the chunky tiles and the brightly colored buildings.

Experience: This game is a real thrill, with a healthy amount of tension coming from the conflicting desire both to increase the size of a corporation, but also buy more stock in it while it is small; also from the desire to invest in the big, safe corporation, planning for the big payoff in the end, but also needing to buy stock in short-term, merge-ready sources of income.

The longevity of this game on the shelves of gamers old and young speaks volumes for its ingenuity and playability. I have always been attracted to its simplicity and the economic system modeling. This is a game that I love playing but get so anxious because of the strong competition that it seems to instill in me. A pure competition game.

Acquire can be very good fun, the trouble is that it can also be terribly boring.  About one in 4 games is really good fun.  The problem arises from the fact that your hand of tiles is so crucial, yet so random.  One can easily be left in the situation of controlling no decent tiles and so having to make guesses about which hotels are going to merge.  This is fine is one has sufficient cash to invest widely, but can make for a dull experience as you wait for someone else to do something to help you out.

RATING: N/A
A really simple economic game. There is a reason why the design has stood the test of time - it works rather well. With the tile drawing, it does rely perhaps too much on the luck of the draw, but being able to read opponents through their investments and strategically invest to both create a massive amount of capital for the end game and to flip some stock for quick wins create a lot of viable strategy.

An all-time classic; I've probably played this more than any other game. Love the AH/Hasbro edition that's now out of print--it adds some nice looking components to go with what is otherwise a fairly dry game. Yes, there's luck in the tile draws but playing loosely and being ready to change direction, and timing that change, are the main skills.  Amazing it was designed in the early 60s.

RATING: 10
It amazes me how such a simple, elegant, almost self-explanatory game can be so deep and engrossing.  Compare this to, say, Rheinlander (to which it is almost identical):  I can teach Acquire in five minutes, whereas Rheinlander can take fifteen minutes or more.  And Acquire just feels more satisfying.  This game ranks third overall in my book after Diplomacy and Scrabble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Asymmetric incentive structures

Hopefully these are starting to seem intertwined by now. This obviously relates to many things I've already discussed. 

In particular, when a game randomizes opportunities / incentives, I would like it to do so differently for different players.

A game with a random setup at the game-level [Settlers] is less interesting than a game with a random setup at the player-level [Race for the Galaxy]. 

A game that presents all players with the same opportunities [Dominion] is less interesting than one that presents them with different ones [Acquire].

I want to feel I am doing something different not just because a winning strategy is "do what no one else is doing".

I want to do something different because I have different sub-goals within the overall goal of winning the game.

Too much luck factor by cap drawing.
Economic facts misrepresented in the mechanics: Stock value goes up when copanies grow instead of stock price raise when stocks run short.
Exchange factor of stocks for bigger company should not be fixed to 2:1 but depending on relative size of respective companies.
For sure, will not play this again.

One of my favorite stock/financial games, this has a little bit of a luck factor, but it takes enough planning and cunning to get ahead.  I had played a previous version with cardboard tiles and hotel corporations, but the copy I just bought is the new AH version with plastic tiles and plastic 3D skyscraper pieces for the different corporations.  Also, I don't think the previous version I played had rules for a 2 player game, and this one does.  It actually worked pretty well, so I was pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoy that change and the plastic pieces, so I am glad they released it again.  Good game, highly recommend this one.

RATING: 9
This game would probably merit a ten from me if it were not for the fact that most of the people I play games with don&#039;t like playing it nearly as much as I do and thus I often have to cajole them into playing with me.  Still, it excels as an abstract strategy game, particularly with variations on the rules where all tiles are exposed.

A brutal Euro (but not from Europe--yay, buy American!) that will do nothing to prevent you from absolutely losing this game.  There is no friendly "reward people who aren't doing as well" catch up mechanic.  

Nope, just like in real business, if someone is beating you, they're going to keep beating you into the ground until you figure out how to catch up.

Which will usually not be until the next game--it's nasty.

It's hard to believe this game is over 50 years old.  It could really use a new edition with updated rules.  The game turns on being part of an early merger.  If you aren't able to participate in the first few, you won't be able to recover.

3-6

Voorbereiding :

1/ Plaats de tegels gedekt naast het spelbord.
2/ De bank geeft iedere speler 6000$ (4x1000$, 3x500$ en 5x100$), een samenvattingskaart en iedere speler neemt 6 tegels. 
3/ Bepaal de startspeler: iedere speler trekt 1 tegel en legt deze op de desbetreffende plaats op het speelbord. De speler met de tegel dichtst bij 1A (kolom per kolom) mag beginnen.

Zie overzichtskaart in spelregels:

Eerste 3 kolommen: bedrijven + aantal tegels (gebruiken om aandelen te kopen en te verkopen)

Vierde kolom: prijs per aandeel volgens het aantal tegels van het bedrijf (gebruiken om aandelen te kopen en te verkopen)

Vijfde en zesde kolom: bonussen (meerderheids- en minderheidsaandeelbonussen worden uitbetaald bij een fusie)

Speelverloop:
 
De spelers spelen volgens beurtvolgorde, beginnend bij de startspeler. In iedere beurt moet de speler volgende 3 acties in volgorde uitvoeren: 

1/ Speel een tegel (Verplicht) 

Neem één van jouw tegels en leg deze op de desbetreffende plaats op het speelbord. Er kunnen zich 3 situaties voordoen: 

1a/ De speler legt de tegel als een ongebonden tegel.

Als een speler een tegel naast een ongebonden tegel op het speelbord plaatst, dan wordt er een bedrijf gesticht. De speler kiest een bedrijf, plaatst het op één van de tegels en krijgt één bedrijfsaandeel. Een tegel die een achtste bedrijf zou stichten, mag niet gespeeld worden!

1b/ Als een speler een tegel zo plaatst, dat hij twee of meer bedrijven verbindt, dan vindt een fusie plaats. Het grootste bedrijf (met de meeste tegels) neemt het kleinste bedrijf over. Bij gelijkstand bepaalt de fusieleider welk bedrijf overleeft. Het gebouw van het overgenomen bedrijf komt terug in de voorraad en de aandelen worden bekend gemaakt. 

Zodra een fusie plaats vindt, moeten alle spelers het aantal aandelen van het overgenomen bedrijf, bekend maken. 

De speler met de meeste aandelen = meerderheidsaandeelhouder, 
De speler met de op-één-na meeste aandelen = minderheidsaandeelhouder. 

De bonussen voor deze aandeelhouders worden uitgedeeld.

+ Als slechts één speler aandelen bezit, dan krijgt hij beide bonussen. 
+ Als er een gelijke stand is voor de meerderheidsaandeelhouder, tel dan de meerderheids- en minderheids bonussen bij elkaar op en verdeel ze gelijk, eventueel naar boven afgerond naar het dichtstbijzijnde betaalbare bedrag. (De minderheids aandeelhouder krijgt geen bonus.) 
+ Als er een gelijke stand is voor de minderheids aandeelhouder, verdeel dan de minderheids bonus onder deze spelers. Rond indien nodig de resulterende bonussen naar boven af naar het dichtstbijzijnde honderdtal. Zie informatiekaart voor de bonussen. 

Nadat de bonussen zijn uitbetaald, moet elke aandeelhouder beslissen wat hij/zij zal doen met zijn/haar aandelen: 

a) Houden: De speler mag zijn aandelen houden (later kan hetzelfde bedrijf nog eens worden gesticht) 
b) Verkopen: Aandelen worden verkocht tegen een prijs die bepaald wordt door het aantal tegels van het overgenomen bedrijf (Zie informatiekaart) 
c) Inruilen: De speler kan voor elke 2 aandelen van het overgenomen bedrijf, één aandeel in het overlevende bedrijf aanschaffen.

De speler mag bovengenoemde mogelijkheden door elkaar gebruiken.
 
2/ Koop aandelen (Optioneel) 

Een speler mag maximaal 3 aandelen per beurt kopen. Dit kunnen aandelen van één bedrijf of van verschillende bedrijven zijn. De prijs per aandeel vindt je terug op je informatiekaart. 

3/ Trek een nieuwe tegel (Verplicht) 

De speler trekt een tegel uit de voorraad. Tijdens deze actie mag hij ook onspeelbare tegels wegleggen en deze vervangen door nieuwe tegels. Dit kan maar eenmaal per beurt gedaan worden.

Einde van het spel :

Het spel eindigt wanneer een speler tijdens zijn beurt aangeeft dat alle bedrijven veilig zijn of date en bedrijf 41 of meer tegels op het bord heeft. De speler die aan het einde van het spel het meeste geld bezit, wint.

Belangrijke regels:

+ Als bij de bepaling van de startspeler 2 tegels aangrenzend zijn, dan worden ze beschouwd als ongebonden tegels. Als er later een tegel wordt toegevoegd worden ze een bedrijf. 
+ Een speler zonder geld, kan geen aandelen meer verkopen. Hij moet wachten tot er een fusie gebeurt met een bedrijf waarin hij aandelen heeft. 
+ Bedrijf = Twee of meer verbonden tegels met daarop een bedrijfsgebouw. 
+ Onverbonden tegel = één of meer tegels die nog niet verbonden zijn.
+ Veilig bedrijf = een bedrijf dat 11 of meer tegels op het speelbord heeft liggen.
+ Een veilig bedrijf kan nooit met een ander bedrijf fusioneren.
+ Op het einde van het spel worden alle actieve bedrijven van groot naar klein afgehandeld. Meerderheidsaandeelbonussen en minderheidsaandeelbonussen worden uitbetaald en alle aandelen worden verkocht tegen de huidige prijs (Zie informatiekaart). Aandelen in een bedrijf dat niet op het speelbord staat, zijn waardeloos.

Fun, fast, furious, and vicious. What more could a capitalist hotel mogul want?

That said, I can see how the players who get money on that first merge are going to have an advantage over the other players. I don't think it's insurmountable, but there's probably a bit more luck to the game than some of the sharks want to admit.

Also, I play with open stocks and open money. You want a memory game, go play Simon.

This game is interesting for a while as the players try to predict and cash in on the first merger. It's difficult to recover if you miss out on that merger and tough to catch those who benefit from it. Props to Sackson, though, for designing a game that's still widely played after 50 years.

Nearly broken.  A longish game that is decided early.  Either by luck or by skill, the recipient of primary payout from first merger will likely win.  If you don't make money on that first merger, or VERY soon afterwards, you are doomed.  The person who owns the most stock early in the largest chain, cannot sell and is essentially out of the game.  I'm good at this game, played many times, and I always pity the damned.

Game drags on if you're not getting money from one of the first two mergers. Maybe I'm just not very good at it.

All the accolades that have been heaped on this game are deserved. This is a game I played in the seventies and ever since. 3 or more players would spend about an hour in a battle of wits and luck unlike anything that had come before it. It is a pioneer that has lasted and can still stand up to the best that is available. I have an original 3M version but judging by the recent reviews the new Avalon Hill version is pretty good. The old Avalon Hill version was too garish and was distracting from the game itself. This is a must buy for any game players out there.

A good game of stock manipulation, far ahead of its time when it was released.  It looks pretty drab and thus sometimes almost feels like accountancy work.  Thus, I think it has been superseded by Knizia's Stephenson's Rocket, which takes the same concept and makes a better game out of it.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great game if people keep their stocks hidden and play pretty fast.  I usually do not like abstract games but this one just gets by.  Very solid game.

Pros:  Tons of difficult decisions in regards to keeping stock or trading 2:1 and especially in trying to determine if someone else might trade all of their stock 2:1 in something in which you are the leader.

Cons:  It is possible for new players to get into a cash crunch (even when you tell them that the first half of the game is all about getting cash for being a majority holder in the smaller hotel chain) which makes the game frustrating for them.

This classic works because it's easy to understand how to play.  The gameplay begins as abstract but the board quickly takes on a character that is different every game.  The strategies are endless (although I usually try to be involved in as many deals as possible and usually do very well....).

Must've played this game hundreds of times since I bought if for $1 at Salvation Army in 1979 (I was in high school). Strategic options are limited but the tension, inability to do everything you want in a turn, and the risk of losing majority shareholder status in a single turn make this game a timeless classic. The game is always enjoyable.

RATING: 3
A game that didn't have much of a chance with me, simply because it's a bit too dry and abstract.  Some of the ideas were intriguing, but I am not engaged by this spatial money puzzle.

I particularly disliked one random element of the game. On any given player's turn, their best option will probably hurt another player.  But there is no connection between who is being hurt and their position.  If the player in last place is standing on the path that best suits me, then I'll crush that player.  This means that getting hit by another player doesn't feel as if they're playing against you specifically.  This creates a feeling of being hosed at random, which I did not care for.

I could make this an 8 if played with 6 players who have all played before.  6 are really needed to fill the board up quicker and make more oppurtunities.  And man can this drag with slow players (with five people before you, your turn should be instant).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple rules, plenty of depth, and appropriate theme.  Random tile draw makes it infinitely replayable.  Unlike other tile drawers that I don't care for (Carcasonne), in Acquire you always have 6 tiles to choose from to play.  This increases your options and adds depth/skill.

If Parker Brothers or Milton Bradley had bought the rights to this game in the 60s, every family would own a copy.  I brought it out yesterday, and one of the other players (who doesn't buy games that often) already has his copy on order.  It's that addictive. Update: Had to drop it down to an 8 (from a 9) because every game I play involves at least one player running out of money and getting shut out of the mergers.  It's never happened to me, but this is a definite flaw that occurs regularly.

Have to drop this a point.  There's just too many games where somone gets locked out of mergers or there aren't but a couple of mergers before the game ends.

Everyone seems to like this game, so it gets to the table frequently (or at least it used to, before I got sucked into the cult of the new). It's a relatively simple but elegant game. Having to place a tile before buying stock creates a fun tension when deciding whether or not to expand a hotel. It's definitely a cash flow game (which I like), but the game is unforgiving if you run out of money to buy stocks. The game can definitely leave players out in the cold, but when it's working right, it's a tense and highly entertaining experience.

Wow... I can't believe what I have been missing all these years! Don't make the mistake of passing this game by in favor of a newer title. It outshines the current crop of popular euro games by a longshot! It seems like a granddaddy to both "tile placement" and to "score majority" games. Sometimes seminal games can be less fun than their kin, but not in this case! It plays in about 45 minutes and is lean and elegant.

Good game!  The best thing about it is that my wife will gladly play.  Nice mix of strategy and luck.  Regardless of how well you plan it is possible to get aced out of early mergers.  If this happens you may end up being an observer and tile layer for a good portion of the game.  I would venture a guess that if you miss out on the first 2 mergers winning the game is next to impossible.

I initially found this game through [gameid=483] (Avalon Hill (Hasbro) ad with game).  I realized my dad had had an old 3M version that I had never played.

I bought it, and I was very pleastantly surprised.  I think this game has a "Euro" feel to it, and as such it might even predate [gameid=13] as a "Eurogame."  It probably had influences on "Eurogame" deigners, so you will probably find elements in this game from others you have played.

This is a great game.  I will play this game pretty much anytime.

Far, far ahead of its time.   I liked the stock aspect of it, and the uncertainty which companies would disappear and reappear.   However, the gameplay is a bit more dry than I expected, and a bit more repetative also.   There's some *pizzazz* missing here.   It's also a math-heavy game with a lot of chart look-up involved.   If I'm going to do that much chart look-up, I think I'd rather play BattleTech and blow something up.   I appreciate it for what it is, and I like how it shows its influence in other similar games like Union Pacific or even Uptown.

Very good game, especially for a game that came out in 1962.

A relatively quick stock holding game with a scrabble-ish board where empires grow on the board and eventually get taken over or take over smaller companies.

I like having to balance buying stocks with your cash reserves and trying to manipulate the board to get pay outs in your benefit. 

However, the random tile draw bothers me. I've had too many instances where i want to merge a company, or grow a company...but all i can do is add to a company where i dont own any stocks and it only benefits my opponents...but thats the only move i have. I also don't like that once you fall behind in stocks, its almost pointless to try and keep up. 

Because the more experienced players have won each game, I'm sure my complaints are more of a me problem than a game problem, but i still find the luck of the draw frustrating.

I don't mind playing the game. But as far as stock games or light economic games go, I'd rather play Chicago Express, Tulip Bubble, or Modern Art.

A nagy kedvenc. Az első verziója még általam fából készített táblával, és fából készített téglatestekkel, persze szépen beleégetve a megfelelő betű/szám. (Vagy 15 éve készítettem 1992-3 környékén) Nyomtatott kártyákkal. Azóta megvan az AvalonHilles műanyag verzió is. Egyszerű szabályok, ugyanakkor széles lehetőségek, bár a húzás miatt szerencse is, de az okos vásárlásokkal ellensúlyozható. Részvénygyűjtés, befektetni a legjobba, beolvasztani, újat alapítani, vagy újba elsőségre szert tenni.

This is just such an excellent and elegantly-designed game.  More than enough words have been written about it, but with its really low bar of entry, this can be played and understood by anyone.  It does have an element of luck, but that's what keeps this replayable.  Fantastic.

Even though Acquire seems dated now, when I was a kid, this game was the most cut throat, devious, backstabbing, kill-your-neighbor game in our closet.  This game made RISK look darn right civil.  Basically, Acquire is like Monopoly, but with a bit more gusto.  You build hotel chains and invest in stocks, hoping that you can keep your chain bigger than your competitors, AND, keep yourself filled up with a diverse stock portfolio just in case they take you over in a merger.  This game has a prefect mix of strategy and randomness to make each game unique and challenging for all players.  I recently got my hands on the 1999 big box edition, which is definitely the coolest edition to have.

I freaking love this game! We've played this twice now in my game group and I find myself thinking about it all the time.  Things that stand out:

The merger mechanic is incredible.  Both games I made myself 'queen of the budget chains' and hoped by positioning that I would be bought out by a larger, more expensive hotel.  There's nothing like having a handful of super cheap stocks and upgrading them into a pile of stocks that no one can afford to buy.  Also, I enjoy that a stock is never wasted.  Even if the chain is gone, you can hold onto it and refound it at a later date.  THAT'S BRILLIANT!!

To me, it's difficult to figure out who is 'winning' at any given point.  My husband has played the game once and spent the first two thirds thinking he was hopelessly out of it, and the game ended with him being in last, less than 3k behind the winner.  The game can swing so quickly.

Acquire is competitive and yet not vicious.  I think what makes it work so well for me is there is no player trading.  I can sometimes feel pressured into making a trade that does me no good in a game just because I want to be 'nice'.

To end, this is a fairly easily taught great game that should be part of every gamers' collection.  As many a person has pointed out, there's a reason this game is 50+ years old and in the BGG top 100.

Tile-laying as a backdrop to corporate acquisitions: slightly hard to wrap your head around the theme, but it serves up some very accessible strategy. The main problem is it's very difficult to catch up once you start falling behind.

Rating has dipped a bit slightly. I enjoy it immensely, but the dryness of it turns off even some of my "Euro" friends. There are better and more thematic games of this weight and flavor (Airlines Europe and Chicago Express). I find it very simple but very strategic even with the bit of luck involved. Could see this being a great gateway game for accountants and people who are "into money".

This game is still very fun for me though.

RATING: 10
This has remained a classic - compared to some newer games this might now seem a little basic and dated, but strangely it's simplicity is part of it's appeal. There have been many discussions about the luck factor of the draw, but in my opinion this element creates good tension that gives the game a quasi relaxed character that makes it more of a family game than let's say "1830" (which has some similarities with "Acquire"). As this is one of the most influential games of all times it should be an essential part of any collection.

I absolutely LOVE it and would always want to play!!  Where has this game been all my life?  

The game Monopoly should have been and should have been pummeled into oblivion by--but wasn't.  What a shame!!  Acquire clones could abound with animals, sports teams, perfumes, clothing, hobbies, etc.

Easy to learn; difficult to master; mathematically interesting; high production quality and graphical design. You'd think it would be a big hit, but something about it just isn't super fun.  Maybe it's the somewhat indirect player interaction, or the fact that you don't really have a position on the board or a character you can identify with (just a pile of stock and money).  I appreciate this one and will often share it with guests because of the easy learning curve, but I'm never eager to play it.  No one ever laughs and has a great time, nor do they have their thinking caps on.

I remember my parents had this game back in the 70's and they liked it. I never played it until I bought it a few months ago. I was looking for games that would support more than 6 players for my game night group.
It was easy to learn, and I think we played it 3 times. This is a fun game, the only negative for me was that at some point in the middle of the game the outcome seemed to be very predictable and nearly impossible to change. However I will admit that it's very possible that I made a mistake with the rules somehow. I would try this again, it's a good game and would be even better with a few adjustments to the rules.

Old favorite. The original hostile takeover game. Pure strategy and market management. Game play calls for subtlety and well timed boldness.  Stripped down aesthetic and focused core game elements. Represented a huge leap forward from monopoly. Often imitated (Lords of Vegas) never surpassed in its property themed genre.

A game with interesting strategy decisions, but lost 1/2 point in my rating due to low production values.  Lost another 1/2 point because the game can be frustrating when random factors combine to defeat even the most skillful play.

I really liked this one.  Took about half a game to figure out what I was supposed to be doing to make money.  I certainly would have made some early moves differently had I known better.  But such is life the first time you play anything.

At any rate I found the game board fascinating in how well it simulates small and large corporations getting eaten up.  Just a brilliant design.

Uno de los preferidos por el grupo. Muy buen juego de gestión ecónomica. Tiene un sistema un poco azaroso, pero muy curioso, al realizar las fusiones de empresas. Hay que jugar con las acciones descubiertas para darle una tensión alta en cada turno de compra de acciones. Lástima que el juego tenga un pequeño defecto; puede darse el caso que un jugador quede descartado para la victoria final en la primera fusión. Dándose la circunstancia que el jugador pasa muchos turnos sin poder hacer acciones en su turno.

RATING: 4
[2 plays] This is one of those games for which I've conceived a possibly premature loathing.  First time I played, it wasn't too thrilling; we played one of the more boringly produced editions, and the whole thing was very old-school and Monopolyesque.  I'm sure it doesn't help that I can hardly imagine a less appealing theme than the stock market.  Tried it again, and a very unpleasant experience the 2nd time has caused this game to incur my further hatred.  It has a reputation as a classic, though, and I'm still not sure I've given it a fair chance.  Perhaps sometime I'll try it again.

The hand management, timing, and balancing of short and long-term goals seems great. It's a lot of fun to grab on to another player's strategy and let them do the work for you. But it is possible to get a terrible hand of tiles and have few options to get cash from mergers. In that case it is important to conserve your money to buy just a few shares of each company so you can get 2nd majority bonuses and trade up for more valuable shares.

This is the original 1964 version of the game. In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock. As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.

I first played this as a kid and loved it ever since.  One of the first games I played where a lot of pure strategy won the day. I like the whole businessman theme of mergers and stocks. Also love the 3d look to the board...I'm glad I have the 99 version with the hotel pieces...was disapointed they did away with them. Would play this anytime though it does require players who know what they are doing/take it seriously.  A bad player can really mess up the game. Fortunately its an easy game to teach and pick up. Top 3 game for me.

RATING: 6.5
I was really looking forward to playing this, and so I was surprised that I found it to be a mediocre experience in my one six-player game.  It was fun, and I'd be happy to play again, but I felt that the progression of the game was largely out of my control, and that determining which companies to invest in was, to some degree, luck.

In the game, I never had a tile that allowed me to start a company or merge two companies - until I made the final merger of the game.  I was able to finish third, because I was the minority share holder in an early merged company and I resunk all that money into the biggest company.  Clearly, its necessary to be involved in an early merger so you have money to re-invest.  But my fortune seemed somewhat arbitrary.  Perhaps more plays will reveal more control.

I think other games have taken Acquire's mechanics and improved them, but I'll need to play with fewer players before I'm sure.

UPDATE - Now played with five and I did like it better, so I upped the rating a tad.  It's a fun game but not all that satisfying.  I felt a bit more in control with fewer players, but the game was still largely decided on seating order.

Classic Sackson economics/finance game, ahead of its time!  Outstanding.

Much debate about open/closed stocks/money (see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/320905/open-or-closed-money-and-stocks]here[/url], [thread=320905]here[/thread], [thread=493567]here[/thread], [thread=636775]here[/thread]). The 1999 rules left it to the players: "[i]Show or hide assets: Players must now decide as a group whether the money and stocks they acquire will be openly displayed. An open display is strongly recommended for new or inexperienced players. If money and stock are not displayed, the game is even more challenging because players must try to remember how much stock each player has purchased.
Note: At any time during the game, a player may ask how many stocks of a company are still unpurchased.[/i]"

The preference of a slim majority of people is to play with open stocks and closed money (see this [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/340460/official-open-or-closed-stocks-poll]poll[/url]).

Hidden stocks: 
+ done in tournaments
+ quicker
- less strategic, go by instinct instead of numbers

Open stocks:
+ is trackable anyway
+ prevents it becoming a memory game
+ is like real world, where stocks are public but money isn't
- slows game down with AP, can run twice as long!

As it happens, no one in my house wants to play it anyway, so it sits unloved on the shelf.

My arc of experience with this classic game was like this: I played it extensively when I was young (I had the 1976 version that I still prefer) and really enjoyed it, then I reacquired it when I got back into the hobby a few years ago and tried to recapture its excitement. I enjoyed it from a nostalgic POV, but alas, it didn't hold up for me in light of modern games due to the randomness. The tile pulls swing things in or out of players' fortunes, and I've seen some players get shut out of the game early on. 

Sure, there can be epically tense plays that come down to the bitter end, but there are more likely going to be sessions with a runaway leader/loser such that it's just too fragile a game considering the other options we now have available to us. 

If you're interested in this game, I would recommend against the newer version with the "all crappy cardboard components" and pick up one of the older ones.

One play with really good old version at a game con.  6 player.  Since not all of us had played it before, end game seemed a little drawn out and a little like the game was playing us as the choices got smaller in our choice of tiles.  Pretty sure this problem would go away with multiple plays as the end game would speed up.

Bummer that newer available versions of this game don't have quite the nice tile pieces as some of the older versions.  This is one of the great classics that actually could benefit from a re-release with plastic componentry.

A classic and very good game. You have a rack of pieces in front of you and try and play them next to it to form hotel chains. Once a chain is formed you (and the other players) can by shares in it - with the bigger the chain the more expensive the shares. If you join two chains, the smaller one gets bought out and the shareholders get paid. 

A recent five-player game (13/09/2012) had one player frozen out for most of the game, yet came second so downgraded rating from 8.5 to 8. Still a very good game.

12/8/10  I just realized that it's been exactly 1000 days since I played Acquire, the game I often consider my all-time favorite.

12/14/10  I got Acquire to the table. Orchestrated a major 3 hotel merger and got a big lead which held up for the win. I still love this game.

4/25/11  Pandemic was great. 5 players won with 5 epidemics in the deck. Still my favorite modern board game (since Acquire)

A great old game that has become a favorite.  I have the 3M 1968 version. With all the fuss over eurogames, I admit that I enjoy the fact that this old American game did what they do earlier and just as well.  I think Acquire paved the way.   Note:  I consider it a great gateway game for financial, economic types who might get lured into board gaming.  It looks dry from a distance but the game play is top notch.  Use poker chips.

Rating after two plays. A very good game that I hope will finish in about an hour once we get the hang of it. If it does, then my rating will probably go up. If it takes longer than that, my rating will probably go down. Although the fact that your tiles can only be placed in one specific spot and therefore the luck level is fairly high, everything about this game is very good. A classic that I'm glad I own.

The Sackson stock-taking wonder from 1962. Has some luck in the tile draw, but it's mitigated by having a hand of six tiles. Besides, who knows when your seemingly useless tiles will become important later on? 5 or 6 players for more fun and chaos, 3 or 4 for more a more thoughtful, controlled game. In any case, still a pretty good game.

Classic. Never taught this game to anyone who didn't like it afterward. There are games deeper and more complicated than this, but it's just as accessible as it is satisfying. Very solid as a gateway - the paper money is something they feel they can understand. Tell them it's like Monopoly but better. 

Only thing is it can feel dry and longer than it really needs to be. I've been told Shark is more fun. Will have to see. Also the latest Avalon Hill version sucks.

The classic Sid Sackson game of stock acquisitions and mergers.

[u]Overview[/u]
The board is a rectangular grid where coordinates represent hotels. The players are investors who buy stock in seven hotel chains in order to gain the most money by the end of the game. Each player holds a hand of six tiles with coordinates on the grid, one of which they have to play each turn, opening a new hotel there. If the location is adjacent to an existing chain, the hotel becomes part of it; if instead it's adjacent to other open hotels not part of a chain, a new chain is formed. A merger happens when playing a tile causes two chains to connect, with the larger company buying the smaller one; the two players with most stocks in the bought chain get an acquisition bonus and everyone has to choose whether to sell, convert 2 for 1 or keep their stock in the bought chain. Companies with at least 11 hotels are safe from mergers and cannot be taken over.

[u]Strategy and comments[/u]
At the beginning money dries up faster than stock, so players try to arrange the acquisition of the companies where they are majority stockholders to receive extra cash (mostly from bonuses) and to move their stock into a better chain (as long as there is some available). An early merger is very profitable because it allows players to reinvest their liquidity into new or better companies, reaping massive profits while drying up the stock; who buys after them will usually do so at a higher price and, due to the limited nature of the stock, might be unable to buy (or convert) into the best companies. Investing in a company that isn't likely to merge can be a huge mistake, as it ties up money without giving a satisfying return. The random draw of the tiles can have a significant effect, as players holding a tile that causes a merger can take better decisions about which stocks to buy. Looking carefully at what everyone is doing may give you a few hints on what to expect, but it will hardly be better than playing the right tile at the right time. A full six-players game will probably last around two hours.

It's a pretty decent game, but nothing to set the table on fire.

This game has the best chance of becoming my second "10".  Granted, it has only been four plays, but I just found it thoroughly enjoyable. It has a lot of strategic depth, yet is not too confrontational.  Not that I mind confrontation, but it doesn't suit everyone in the family. The game is also pretty easy to teach, and covers a good spread of players.
---------------------
Update:
I still don't win often, but I love this game!  You will hear people lament the poor components of the 2008 version.  I don't agree.  The stock cards are far superior, even as the board components are not.  I have played on the 2008 board and a 1968 board, and they bother have their strengths and weaknesses.  If you are fretting over it, don't.  You are losing time when you could be playing this great game!

In Acquire hotels are formed, expanded and eventually merged. These hotels have shares that can be bought by any of the players, so in effect most of them will be owned by 2, 3 or more players. 
The hotel's expansions are done by a mechanism of tile placement where players try to control the hotel's growth at their best possible interest (not always possible...).
Might seem strange but with more players the game turns globally less chaotic as it approaches the rules of normal markets. With fewer players, each player has more control over the tile placement process and can turn apparently bad investments into good ones.
There is a luck factor involved (especially if you pick a tile that allows a perfect hotel merge), but a good reading of the market evolution is normally the key for victory.
The few money you start with, is perfect to create the right amount of tension during the investment stages. 
The game offers different ways to victory, either by making sucessive small wins (producing small hotel merges) or by being able to do a few big wins (holding a good number of shares from the biggest hotels).
The rules can be explained in 5 minutes.

An OK game with the right length, but the random draw of the tiles restricts your actions far too much.

I like to think about all the squares as being a patent for some technology rather than a hotel block. Then you can say: "I am proud to announce the merger of Luxor's Silk Diaper industry with Continental's Sushi Design experts!" Let you imagination run rampant. This is a fine game of investing. It's painful for the player who sits doing nothing with no money and no lucky tile draws and gets left behind. Seems to be one in each 4 player game.

RATING: 8
Surprisingly good. Although having limited ability to place tokens on the board (only five random pieces) seems like it would seriously impair the player interaction (there are occasional opportunites for great moves when the board starts to fill out), the ability to buy whatever stocks you want (between 0 and 3) is primarily where the conflict in this game presents itself. There is a reason that this game has lasting appeal.

Considering its age, Acquire is a very good game. Still, when comparing it to current titles, the paint is starting to come off.

You buy shares in hotel chains, then try to make bucketloads of money when merging your chain with another. Which chains can be established and merged is decided by pulling chits which essentially means that which mergers happen when is largely decided by the luck of the draw.

It's also a very dry affair overall and, depending on which edition you get to play, its presentation can be rather drab.

One of the greatest games you can play. What a great concept Sid Sackson came up with. The game mechanics are simple and elegant. This is almost (if not in fact) the grandaddy of all "Euro-style" strategy board games. Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you haven't already, and be sure to get a copy with tiles that remain in place on the board, and not the versions that have cheap cardboard ones.

What other game can you form a hotel chain and proclaim: "Who can... AmeriCAN."?

A wonderfully tense game of abstract economics by the master Sid Sackson.  I took a >20 year hiatus from this gem and regret it dearly.  The theme is fairly thin, but that doesn't matter at all.

[2015.07.20]

The luck factors too much into this game.  While I still enjoy the occasional play, my tastes have changed such that I'm less enamored by wild swings of luck in a game that purports to be about skill.

Its only flaw is the money manipulation aspect, which is toned down when playing with poker chips.

Acquire is an early and uber-smart entry from Sid Sackson.  Even with the luck of tile draws, you are managing your tiles in a way that benefits you and not your opponents.  The purchasing, selling, and trading of stocks is a very clean and realistic system.  Acquire (like Bazaar) is a great, heady workout with math.  It shows Sackson's ability to make games that involve money and random tile pulls very interesting and competitive.  Plus, the 1999 AH version is a sight to behold in terms of its design!  Sometimes it runs too long for a game that is essentially a three-step pattern of turns, but overall this is one of the top stock holding games I've ever played.

Acquire is a game with two faces for me.  Either I enjoy my experience and feel I have control over my game, or I just can't wait for the madness to end.  I realise and can see the clever play in this one, but for some reason my sessions with acquire have left me with the aforementioned spectrum splitting feelings.  It is this inconsistency in my experiences that leaves me giving this classic a slighty better than mediocre score.

UPDATE:  Stephenson's Rocket makes this Sid Sackson classic obsolete.  With a similar core, Stephenson's is able to strip away the luck that plagues Acquire, as well as make it a more simple and elegant design.  

I just believe the tile draws to be too powerful in this game.  If you don't get the right draws, the game is tedium as you watch your opponents pull away, and the rich get richer.

The issue I have with this game is that if no one takes over the companies in which you hold stock, and you don't draw those merger tiles yourself, you're stuck sitting there only playing tiles.  It's still a fun game though, and something a family would like to play.

Variant: After each round (once around the table), randomly draw a tile and place it on the board.  This will both speed the game up and mean that new hotels may have a higher stock price right off the bat.

Probably one of the best games of all-time. Rating lowered a little. Play on 3-20-11 resulted in one of the players never having a merger and so he never had money to spend. For him it was a boring game and my reduction reflects his dilemma. I lost game by 100 dollars!
LOCATION: B3

7-27-14 Game this evening one of the best we have had. 3 player Barb(RIP) , Mike and me (Ron) won by Mike with 57,300 to my 55,800 and Barb's 54,000 won on last play by Mike when he merged a corner tile with Continental 3 squares big into American to get paid for first in Continental and also end the game. I was second in Continental but the difference between Mike' first and my second gave him just enough $ to at the end after all the final payoffs give  him a 1500 dollar win. If I could have reached 41 tiles and ended the game I would have won and if Barb could have done a small Festival merger before Mike she would have merged into American creating 41 and she would  have won and she had the tile to do so.

Has very little theme and comes down to counting cards to keep track of hidden information. All in all, an enjoyable game that's very easy to teach, but very dry. Has definite problems with stalling out if you're not able to cash in on one of the early buy-outs and then people muscle you around while you're broke.

RATING: 8
Unique game concept in which the board is not a geographical map, but more of an abstract description of the relative sizes of companies and their probabilities of taking part in a merger.

I have the Hasbro 2008 edition, which is distinguished by its truly deplorable component quality.  (I think this is the first time that a game publisher has expected me to construct a Scrabble-style tile rack from a thin cardboard punch-out.)  I will be keeping an eye out for opportunities to pick up a different release.

Plays pretty well all the way up to 6 players, but there is lots of downtime with that many at the table.

My AH Edition is a much-appreciated part of my game collection.  I also have a 1963 3M with wooden tiles lacking one chain marker and an outer sleeve. I will always want to play this game and recommend the Broker Variant for two players.
Update: I've lowered my rating to a "7",, reason being, that the founding of a corporation with its stock bonus, can be and has resulted in one player, due to lucky tile draws, a disproportionate gain of free stock which I feel is a problem with some games of Acquire.

Okay, this game is a sacred cow in the game world, but I haven't enjoy it most of the times I have played it. There is always some sad player who is out of phase with the game. They're out of money and their turns are all but meaningless. It's tough to watch this player going through the motions being dragged by the game. It's even tougher BEING that player. A player can make all the right choices and still be completely snake bit. There are so many better game available now, why bother with this tired old dog. If you're looking for a game that can scratch your Acquire itch, try  [GAMEID=433], the Ravensburger 2001 Edition, instead.

90% luck. If you have bad luck you can never build a hotel chain and get one extra card. If you have bad luck you can never do a fusion. If you are at the wrong place on the table, all players before you buy all the interesting stuff. Totally random and waste of time.

Even my 2nd play couldn't improve my opinion about this game. I prefer watching paint drying.

It's horrible with 6 players, you wait about 15min for your turn because some people are thinking about 2-3min. And this is a totally waste of time, you also can complete your turn within 20s and you can win.

RATING: 7
For an oldie very good and even when measured with today's standards it holds its ground. Simple rules and yet a challenging gameplay. There is randomness but in the end your score depends on your skill and outsmarting abilities.

There are many games published 10 or 20 years later that don't reach the level of Acquire in any way, shape or form - it's classics and still fresh. Although some of its elements are not as good as they should be, it's still hell of a game.

Recommend.

Very simple game to learn and pick up. Plays very well in general but suffers from both "bad player syndrome" & can slow hugely if merger tiles down get drawn.

All in all, this is a good game that I don't mind playing at all. Not many games that play 6 well and this does.

An old classic, and a favourite of mine. Simple, elegant and one game I happen to feel I am pretty good at! Definitely a lot more to it than might appear at first glance; while the luck of the tile draw is significant, you can influence this element a lot more than many realise.
I definitely prefer those editions with proper physical tiles rather than a flat board and cards or chits.
IMHO, this is not a memory game and shares should be played open, though I don't mind playing semi-open or closed.

I have the 3M ver about 1971 with the stoned looking people on the money #ser 3m4fun4me2.  I had not played this game in some years and had thought I had put it in a place where no one would bother it.  I was wrong! I took the game down to show a couple of friend the game I had always loved.  upon opening the case I discovered that someone had taken all the play money out and I found I,m now missing 4 tile... what to do?  The play money didn't change much even after Avelon Hill took over from 3M ser# changed to AH4fun4me2.  Is it possible that someone out there can email or send me a pic of each of the four differnt bills.  All of mine are lost and have no way to copy more.  Would prefer old 3M or AH ver. Looked for latest ver a toyrus, the last place I knew the game could be bought.. no luck they never heard of Acquire.

Sid Sackson's masterpiece is considered a landmark in game design for good reason. It has one big problem, however: it just looks and sounds like it would be incredibly boring (especially the drab 3M edition, which looks like something that only an accountant could enjoy).  With three or four players, Acquire is a delicately-textured counterpoint of many levels of strategy and tactics.  Outrageous luck will occasionally rear its head, but most games will be won through skillful play. And despite the rather somber appearance, it's not an intimidating or brain-burning type of game.  And *definitely* not boring! (unless you play with hidden shares a.k.a. "Acquire the Headache")

Terrific game, with more (subtle) player interaction than evident at first glance. I'd rate the game even higher if it had less "work" (making change, counting shares, indexing values, etc.), but this is a minor quibble -- Acquire is one of the all-time greats, and even if you don't want it in your collection, you should at least play it once.

Fantastic game with minimal luck and quick pace that escalates the tension right until the very end. The game is deservedly acknowledged as a classic: it's easy to learn, is competely unique, and will appeal to a wide audience while still being a "gamers" game at its core. My only complaint is the amount of multiplication, addition, and referencing that's necessary every turn of the game. You'll need one person who's good at basic accounting (or with a spreadsheet!) to keep track of the costs of things. Great game, however, and highly recommended.

After many plays, I can say that Acquire is probably a good game, but it's not one I really ever want to play.  It seems less like a game and more of an abstract mathematical simulation, except with a small element of bluffing and quite a lot of luck.  In fact, it seems that if the players are all sufficiently familiar with the game, a lot of it just comes down to luck.  I just don't like it at all.

Acquire is dry as a bone, but it stands the test of time. I like that the complexity of the game arises from the many strategies one can employ rather than the rules (which are pretty simple and straightforward).

A strong argument can be made that Acquire is the father of modern "eurogames" but it remains an eminently playable one.

I have played this game hundreds of times, and enjoy each playing as much as the last.  I have friends who have played thousands of games of Acquire, who feel the same way.  This is a great game: easy to learn, lots of decisions, great ability to help yourself and hurt your neighbor with a single tile placement, and good finishes.

Played today for the first time in 30 years or so.  It is a fun game but I had horrible luck drawing tiles and my wife and son killed me.
This game is similar to Airlines Europe except that you need to gain stock in the weak companies that will be merged (which is a little non-intuitive).

For long time Acquire players the challenge in this one is that the hotel chains were recategorized. For example, Tower is now a premium chain. Is nothing sacrosanct?

And, Luxor is now Sackson... partially in honor of Mr. Sackson, but maybe some concern over legalities with the Las Vegas hotel... which I believe came after the game, so not much to stand on there...

Challenging and interesting game of betting on futures with some area control thrown in. The first few turns are somewhat cut and dried, but after a little while each turn presents interesting difficult choices. The game mechanics are pretty simple and easy to pick up.

I'd rate it more highly but 1) the components are all plastic, and 2) the theme isn't a big draw for me. Winning based on having more money than everyone else seems a hollow victory.

RATING: 8.5
After just one game I give this a solid 8.5. It is a fun game, but takes quite a while to fully grasp what is needed to succeed. My next game will be much clearer, and I can't wait to give it another whirl. It has a nice balance between trying to out think your opponent and guess at what stocks they will purchase, and worrying about what tiles your opponents have that could possibly merge your companies when you don't want them to merge. The 3 tiers of companies adds another bit of strategy, in whether you want to invest in the heavy hitters, or get quick money with the low cost start-ups.

Played twice with 6 and really enjoyed it. I think it would probably be better with fewer players, maybe 4. At 6 sometimes the stocks get swiped up really fast so where you sit in the turn order is really important, and also a matter of luck. I did also note that in both games the person who started what ended up being the largest property won. Not sure if this was an anomaly or what, will see what happens next time. I would probably recommend this to anyone looking for a classic medium weight game.

Original (2003): Avoided playing this for years. The tile mechanic just seemed too random to me. After playing the game a few times, I feel the need to repent. An amazing game that requires an flexible approach against an ever changing board. Update: Here at the University of Illinois College of Law this game has, at least temporarily, replaced Poker. A dozen or so people have learned to play, and the game is hitting the table two or three times a week for a pre-bar play. 

Update (2010): I don't know how many games have been played at this point, but it seems increasingly obvious that the game becomes increasingly strategic as the players become more experienced. 

Update (2014): Still playing. I wish I'd kept track of how many games, but if you count online play, it's in the hundreds.

Update (2016): And I just keep on playing. I have seven active games on gamesbyemail.com, with friends, at all times.

Note: when it comes to table play it's worth tracking down an early edition with the plastic board and tiles. All of the subsequent versions feel junky, fiddly, or cheap.

RATING: 8
With a theme of corporate America and a bland-looking board covered in nothing but letters and numbers, it might seem odd that I find this game as enjoyable as I do. And indeed, there is a strong feeling of abstraction. But stronger still is the feeling of tension that exists here. Acquire is chock-full of moments that literally get your heart racing, not in excitement, but in suspense.

The turn structure (and the game itself) are quite simple. You place a tile, buy up to three stocks, and draw a new tile. Two adjacent tiles starts a corporation, which will grow in stock price with the addition of further tiles. When two corporations are joined, the bigger one takes over the smaller one. Those with stock in the smaller one get a payout, either in cash or stock of the larger company. This continues until the board is full, and everyone gets a final payout for the stocks they hold. 

The strategy here is about getting majority ownership in as many companies as possible. This requires getting others to help you merge companies (by having SOME stock in them) but with you holding the most. It also requires careful managing of your cash flow so you can always spend your money on new stocks, predicting the right moment of the merger. Your stocks never really LOSE value, which I like, but it can definitely be bad to invest heavily in a company that only sees minor growth.

It's a shame that the current printing of this venerable classic is so shoddy. The 1999 edition is the kind of treatment it really deserves. This one is a very fun game, not just for when it came out, but even today.

I don't really like this game, but there's no denying that it's a classic.  I recently came in 2nd in a game (as opposed to my regular last place) because I held shares in almost every company.  Well, it was also because I actually got some merge tiles, and thus had control over who got money and who didn't.

I must remember never to play a 3-player game.  Usually, one person gets screwed (getting no cash until the end of the game) while the other two get multiple payouts which allows them to re-invest and grow.  The only way out of this is to find some incentive for another player to make a merger that pays something to you.  Perhaps you have to play for second place in other people's big companies... but that gets competitive too.

This looks and feels old, but also all too fresh at the same time. Playing this for the first time in 2014 makes me wonder, if Sid Sackson were alive today, would he be partaking producing worker-placement resource conversion games? I say this because this game was created before there seemed to be *an8 archetype for what a boardgame should be, or at the least the archetype that would have been available for boardgames at the time (as I understand it) wasn't all that hot (and invited different takes). 

Social commentary aside, this economic tile laying game holds up incredibly well today for a game from the 1960s. It has the spatial competition, interaction, and vague ownership of Tigris & Euphrates with a speculative market (rather than a more granular victory point system). When to buy shares and how many becomes a financial game of chicken as you want to maximize your shareholding (and not get locked out of growing businesses) but at the same time, you don't want to be unable to participate in buying shares because you blew your load too early. Great economic and spatial interaction and competition. The fluid financial values make it difficult to keep track of who's where, which I appreciate (so long as everyone at the table is down for a gut feeling type game - which I usually am).

-------------------------------------------------------
Update September 2015
I've dropped the rating from an 8 to a 7 as I'm not sure how deep the game is -- while I still very much enjoy the game (it's tense, fun, and iconic), I'm not sure how many more strategic surprises the game has in store in terms of creative, clever, and dickish plays.

I recognize the importance of Acquire (as well as how easy it is to teach), but given the choice, would rather play Tigris and Euphrates, Reef Encounter, or Khronos.

RATING: 8.5
Classic game, with a good portion of luck in the drawing of tiles. You have to be in some of the early mergers to prevent you from falling behind. The key is to predict (unless you can control) which chains will be taken over and merged in to a larger chain. 

The game is very easy to learn, and is suitable for the casual gamers as well as experienced gamers who can tolerate some luck. I am a happy owner of the 1999 Hasbro Edition which has been made with quality components. The latest version (2008) with thin cardboard bits looks cheap and does not do this fine game justice. Such a classic game should be produced with better components.

Acquire is always a fun one for us to play when we're in the mood for some economics. It's not necessarily a crowd favorite but when we do play everyone always enjoys it.

There are alot of games when we're all just sure we know who will win and then it turns out to be someone else.

I have the 1999 Avalon Hill/Hasbro version with the plastic skyscrapers.  In this stock market type game you lay down tiles to create, grow, and merge corporations.  I like playing with either open or closed holdings.  There is a definite luck facter in this game with the tile draws.  It is a little too easy to run out of money and just be stuck while others benefit from mergers.

Now that I've played it a few more times, this game has held strong ground.  Trying to piece together tiles for your own benefit while investing in the right companies at the right time is a lot of fun.  A bonus is that my parents both like this game so it's pretty easy to get on the table.

However, the luck can be a bit much.  If you establish a company early and are able to pick up a bunch of stock in it, then sell it, and continue to build it once or twice more, there's just not much to be done about it.  If the tiles are on your side, you can get a lot of extra bonuses.  If they're not on your side though, it can feel fruitless.  I also don't particularly like how people can be ousted for many turns until someone finally merges the right companies.  It's their own fault, sure, but it brings down the fun if you sit there just playing a tile while others continue to buy up stocks and dominate you.

I happened to buy as a curiosity at Value Village.  It's a blue fabric covered edition which slides open like a book in a book sleeve box. Outer box say 1962 date but inner rules are 1966.  Plastic game pieces with hotels labeled simply "F" or "T".

It is complete as I have all the tiles and I think all of the cards and money. Likely worth 50+ dollars as condition is pretty good.

There are a couple of things that put me off this game. One is the fiddly nature of buying the shares each round. Second is the large luck factor - there's a big advantage when you are lucky and can draw the tiles which are going to cause mergers.

I suck at this game. somehow I just can't do it right and join the right company at the right time and I usually end up third or fourth. it's very random in the tile draw but it doesn't overstay it's welcome and is actually easy to teach. for a game that's more than 50 years old that's an achievement worthy of the rank it has. it's one that every serious gamer should have played at least a couple of times.

Classic game that remains great fun even today. I wouldn't necessarily want to play any cardboard version outside of the 1999 Avalon Hill edition, because it's just more visual and fun for me and our group with that edition. Sure, sometimes you get crap tiles in some games, but that process is not bad enough to lower my rating.

This was acquired during my early 3M game collecting days.  I have played this several times, and had difficulty with the concept.  It is a classic, and old edition, and looks it.  I guess I am holding onto it mostly for nostalgic reasons.

It sounds like there are lots of gamers that rave about Acquire.  I have to say I am a little underwhelmed.  The game seems to rely on tile drawning luck, and limited buying opportunities.  When my game group played this, the ultimate winner never felt they were in a winning position...

Interesting....played this after 2 hours of playing Apples to Apples, so it was really anticlimactic.  I have to say though, it's a really good game.  We played with open holdings, and as such it reminded me of Union Pacific.  In truth, though....I'd rather play Union Pacific.  I guess I'm a sucker for trains.

RATING: 10
A classic game that continues to be heralded as one of the greatest games ever published, and deservedly so. Simple rules, simple play, but sophisticated strategy and some luck. The theme is abstract, but the feel is undeniably "corporate" / "big business". The best incarnations are the 3M/AH bookcase version with hotels (if you can find it) or the 1999 AH/Hasbro big box version with corporations (again, if you can find it). Avoid the cardboard versions if you can. What AH has done, reprinting this game on TWO different occasions with lousy cardboard is not only criminal... it's an outrage. Shame on you corporate bean counters!

Update (08/22/09) 6 plays - Seems to drag out unnecessarily with 6 players, and there seems to be too much chaos. It is relatively unpredictable what will happen in-between turns, and waiting for five players to react is too long. Sometimes, it is just luck that one picks the right corporation(s) to invest in. Feels like 4 players would be the sweet spot, but will have to play some more.

Update (08/14/10) 17 plays: Played with 6P and won, but barely. Another player and I were conceivably not doing so well throughout the game, but were only $200 off! The 2nd place player had majority one of the three final corporations (39 tiles, upper-tier), while I had 1st place the last of the three (16 tiles, middle-tier), and 2nd place in the second largest (25 tiles, lower-tier). It seemed that one player who merged within the first turn, would have the advantage in gaining a huge influx of cash early, but he didn't win, since he allocated his capital poorly in some corporations that did not grow. With 6P, I believe one must be extremely selective in what corporations they invest in, and not just any one because they're cheap (if it doesn't grow, it's dead money). At least I knew that I had the expansion (and merger) tiles for the corporations I was investing in. There is some uncertainty, as players ahead of you will merge unexpectedly, or start a corporation somewhere where you didn't want it, but one must adapt; sometimes, they give you the game unexpectedly. For this game, I went in with the intention of being extremely selective, so is that the winning strategy for 6 players?

Update (08/18/2014) 36 plays: Still a solid "10" after all these years. Played the two-player variant rules, but aborted halfway through game. The game is extremely fragile and easy to break. The game is very slow to develop initially, since there are only two tiles to start out. If one player is lucky enough to get a merger, they will most likely get the minority bonus (as the tile draw determines how many shares the bank has, and that can range up to "12"), and the other player will get nothing. From there, it is an economic snowball with very little chance of clawing back in. That minority bonus can be used to buy all the vulnerable corporations, essentially locking out the other player from getting any bonus (the bank getting the majority, most of the time). Possible fixes (that have been play tested by others) are to start with $10,000 instead of $6,000, and to halve the number on the tile draw to determine the number of shares from the bank. Rules as written, two-player is broken and not recommended. It is a "2". With fixes, it may be higher, but I think I'll never play this again with two.

It's kind of a travesty that Monopoly is making millions every year and has a complete hold on the popular view of what a board game is when a genuinely good game like this has been around for 50 years and is virtually unknown outside the board game niche.

This is very thematic, the way you need to maintain liquidity and you can completely screw someone out of the assets they have spent the game building up just because they have no money left and you do really makes a player feel like a business mogul

It plays quite quickly and takes up to six, both of which are good traits.  You do need to play the odds, you can't go in with a predetermined strategy because what tiles you get has a huge impact on what you can do.  If you do not like games that require you to manage chaos you may not like this.  This is not to say that it is a random game, the decisions you make are what creates the opportunities for you to do well.

My only complaint, and unfortunately it is a significant one, is that if you bet wrong you may end up crippled with all your assets invested in hotel chains that aren't being developed and no ability to do anything to affect your position. When I started playing this sort of thing happened a lot because people put all their eggs in one basket and when that basket was left on the shelf they got in trouble.  Now people almost never do that and ensure they have a diversified portfolio so that hopefully most things that might happen can profit them somewhat.  Even though that makes it less likely it is still possible that your investments end up not paying off and once you have no money you are powerless for the rest of the game.  This is no fun and makes you glad this is a relatively short game.

Still, on the whole this is a great game which I recommend.

1 play where I, from start to finish, never knew what I was doing or what I need to do. It must have been so frustrating to the other players - I apologised frequently throughout the game - but I guess they were not minding me and just concentrating on their game.

20/09/08: Played this for the second time and, as I got someone kind enough to go through the motions, patiently, explaining step-by-step, I actually enjoyed it.

That shows you how a bad game experience can put you off a game even if the game in itself is essentially a good game.

One of only three games I own which I recommend to both family and gamers, the others being Modern Art and Scotland Yard.  Acquire has two parts: (1) a distinctly abstract method of visualising the growth of corporations over which the players have direct (but not complete) influence, and (2) an element whereby players have to manage the risk of their investment based on the size of the corporations.  These two elements combined offer a unique gaming experience which is both deep yet accessible!

I'm not completely sure how I feel about the game on one play, but the 1999 Hasbro / Avalon Hill Edition was very fun to play with--those components are so nice!

Because we played a 6 player game, we added a small 3rd place pay-out from mergers and the ability to sell stock. This created some interesting payouts when someone got 3rd on one stock because everyone else had sold theirs thinking it wouldn't have been enough to get anything.

Stock manipulating games tend to be fairly dry, which is why this has never sold as well as rivals like Monopoly. Were this to be published as a German game today it would be derided for its luck of the draw mechanism, so I suspect there's some sentiment in the high ratings here. You need to ensure that you're a beneficiary of the first merger or two, that's the only way that you can gain liquidity. If you don't and run out of money you'll rapidly fall behind and the extent to which you do that is largely governed by the random tile draw. In spite of all the above, this is one of the few Sid Sackson games I'm happy to play. A well above average game for the date of its invention.

3-5 players? By Sid Sackson. A stock holding game. Video 104001 shows fiddliness (frequent cash transactions), unexciting gameplay, and tedious end-game scoring.

This one has certainly earned its classic status. *Pros: Great decisions, fun gameplay. *Cons: Not much player interaction beyond the "I screwed you by the placement of my tile," at least in my extremely limited experience.

First played March 4th, 2009. Taught in 10 minutes, played in about and hour and 15 minutes with 3 players. It seems with more players it would take a little longer. There is good luck/strategy balance in the game. You will need to decide when a good time to buy and sell to make the most money at the end of the game. Each player is given $3,000 to start and each player draws a tile to place on the board and 6 to fill their starting tiles. Then the start player places one of their 6 tiles. If that creates a space with two or more tiles together then they place a hotel of their choice (from 6 hotels out of the game) and get 1 stock of that hotel (for free) and can buy up to three of any hotels (can three different or 2 of one and one of another as well) that are in existance. The cost of the 3 stocks is dependant of how many squares make up the hotel and the type of hotel (see chart). Then you draw a tile to get back up to 6. Each following player can place a tile (creating a new hotel if possible, adding on to an existing, or a single tile) and has the option to buy up to three stock. A player may also merge ONLY if at least one hotel has less than 10 tiles, otherwise those tiles can be thrown out of the game. If the tile merges two or more hotels then there is a merger and the lesser hotels merge into unless it's a tie and the tile place decides. The majority and minoirty stock holders gets a certain bonus. If a tie, those tied split. Merging hotels' stock can either be traded in 2 for 1 of the new stock, sold a current value prior to the merger, or held (if held and the chain does not start back up again it would be worthless. Starting with the tile placer, each can trade in stocks or sell. The the current player gets their option to buy 3 stocks. The game is over when there are no more stocks to be sold. Once a hotel was merged it's avaliable to be re-placed on the board if the senerio presents itself. You can't place a tile to create a new hotel chain if none of the 6 hotels are availble to be placed.

Wow. Aquire is a super cool fun hotel speculating / investing game. Awesome game. Great choices to make on your turn, good player interaction. I enjoy the Goldilocks - "just right" elegant game weight packed in a pleasant 1.5 hour play time. Play Acquire ASAP if you haven't tried it yet. I love it. 9/10

-------------------

[i]Acquire[/i] is a game where players take the role of investors buying shares in hotel companies, and capitalising on mergers, and growing their chains of hotels. This game can be played from 3 – 6 players, which is a big plus, in my opinion, as it seems to scale very well, but plays differently at each level. The complexity is fairly low, and younger gamers should have no trouble understanding how to play, though the nuances of strategy may be out of their grasp.

The basis of the game is, of course, a share market mechanism, and it the main decisions on the game are choosing the right moment to invest in a company, when to merge, and even when to end the game. The tiles and luck impact the amount of control you have over where the game goes, whether one hotel will grow bigger, or be merged and usually does not stop a player from making the right decisions, though it is still possible to be severely hampered by an unfortunate run of tiles, as has happened to me numerous times. However, a better player should be able to time their purchases correctly, and as buying usually is not affected by tile-laying, there is plenty of opportunity to maintain a lead.

In conclusion, this game is very good at doing what it does, and the difference in play for each number of players and variance in tile layout ensure that there will be much replay ability in this game. The thing that stops [i]Acquire[/i] from being rated a 10 is the lack of control. Though it should not prevent a good player from winning, it can detract from the experience, as you do not dictate the direction and have no chance to take the initiative. It is rare that this continues for the whole game, however, keeping this game’s rating at a very respectable 9.

[b]Pros[/b]
-	Fast paced
-	Interesting decisions for most of the game
-	Lots of player interaction
-	Scales very well
-	Luck is minimal

[b]Cons[/b]
-	Lack of control over game at some stages
-	May be at mercy of other players

The perfect mix of tile picking luck and strategic placement. Picture Monopoly meets Scrabble and had a child that was actually fun. I can play this with family and friends and it has yet to repeat itself or get dull.

Devious game with slight learning curve. The 1962 version of the pieces and board are a much better setup than the new version.  That said, the updated graphics/money are a nice change.  I miss lock-in counters of the 1962 version - a feature way ahead of its time.

I like this game.  It is a fairly quick game to play compared to some of our others.  I would have liked to have gotten a Hasbro Avalon Hill edition (which is now out of print) but I have two 3M copies.  The game is simple to teach to new players.  The trick is to acquire stock in companies and become the majority holder in the ones that grow.  But you also want to have a majority of stock in companies that are going to be dissolved when they are acquired so you get more cash.

Down graded from a 10 to 9 after playing Union Pacific.

I finally played this old classic of Sackson's and I felt lukewarm, at best, toward it.  Acquire is pretty dated by now.  There's a significant amount of luck in tile draws, deciding what to buy can feel arbitrary at first, and there isn't a whole lot really going on.  Basically, it's a guessing game on what shares to buy as little information comes up as to what will merge and payoff.  Miss the first few mergers and it can feel like a prolonged funeral.  I'd play it again, but probably wouldn't ever request it.

Being played alot lately, wife's favourite game, really enjoy playing, you have to be on the ball or you can make a mistake and sit and watch because of no money to purchase, one person always seems to fall for this problem. Love playing have the 1976 version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Loads of fun, sometimes things can happen that nobody expected.

I've had games where I had been doing really well, and would've clinched victory on my next turn with a big merger... only for it to happen halfway across the board.  Not because my opponent wanted it, but because it was the least suicidal play he had.  This opponent held no more than two shares of either chain.  I lost.

And if you have them, absolutely use the one-shot powers.  Great addition, agonizing decisions when to drop 'em.

In all reality this is not a 10/10.  I however do rank it as a 10/10 because of its sentimental factor.  

Acquire is the game that got me into the hobby.  Its the game I have played with casual gamers that has gotten them into gaming.  Its easy to teach, fun to play, and has that climatic ending!

While there are games that are better now days for me this will always be one of my favorites.  Over 200 plays for me and I still love it.

It is a classic, but the lure of perfect information strains my memory.  It will always have a special place on my shelf though, it's the first real board game I was ever exposed to.

You can nit pick at it, but there's really just nothing else with the shelf life of Acquire that can compare.

Aug17:  I think the game theory is more solid than I gave it credit for.  Bumping back up a bit.

I love this little capitalist economic simulation game. It can be very unbalanced to the point that one or more players have virtually no chance with significant game time left, but it can also be extremely tight, right up to end time accounting of everyone's sweet cash. That makes it a bit cut throat, which I think adds a fun amount of realism.

A classic Avalon Hill game.  Though it has been recently reprinted, I think I want to wait and find the Hasbro edition with the plastic pieces.

There is a nice balance in the game between do I want my copy to get larger so I can win at the end of the game or to sell it off early to get more profit now.  The downside of the game is that there can be a lot of luck in tile draws.  In the early game, you want to be able to start a company and get the free stocks for opening a company.  If you don't get that, then you can be quickly out of the game.

This game really achieves a lot with an extraordinarily simple ruleset. 

It is however a bit fragile and with less experienced players  turns into a game of feast or famine, where reckless players will either win the game or be totally knocked out in the mid game, while conservative players will be doomed to forever come in second behind the lucky winner.

Good for its age, but see EDITs...
I'd say it's slightly better with higer number of players (5-6) than with lower (3).

AH 1999 edition rulez ;-)

[I had a chance to play AH 2008 version -> horrifying experience...;  and I see no appeal in 1995 Schmidt Spiele version -> AH 1999 edition is SO MUCH better...]

EDIT: I can see the problem - sometimes game puts you in 'no control, no win' situation and you cannot do anything about it.  Also, sometimes I feel there is too little room for manoeuvre and too few interesting decisions.

EDIT2: After 6 plays I can conclude with certainty - the game is very luck-dependent and huge snowball effect can occur too.  Of course, there are games when the luck is equally distributed and then satisfying, close, emotions-packed game shapes up, but this happens in the minority of cases...

So far 8 plays on computer version...

I can see why this game not only stands the test of time, but does it with style. It may be a dinosaur but it won't ever be extinct, looks to be the grand-daddy of tile layers. Very calculative and engrossing, great watching the hotel chains grow and then merge. Fast play, some strategy, quite tactical and fun getting rich.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] I was surprised how well this game handled 6 players, it was a little slow and long for what it is but it was smooth overall and didn't seem too chaotic like I thought it might be with 6. We played the Sid S variant of putting all the unclaimed tiles (after initial random distribution) back on the board upside down at the start of the game and picking from the board which gives you much more control than picking randomly from a blind pile, I don't think I can go back now...

Acquire has one of the best board development mechanics that I have seen. What happens in the play area directly affects the value of companies and stocks, and that makes it addictive. Random tile drawing can get frustrating though.

I kind of dismissed this game for a long time because I felt like it was too random, but now I'm starting to change my mind a bit.

The thing that has made the difference is that I have started hanging on to pieces that are near or adjacent to chains rather than playing them.  The result - I now mysteriously have merger pieces all the time whereas I used to complain about how I never drew them.

I feel like I should have had this "aha" moment a long time ago.

Takes second place to Union Pacific in my book, both having very similar mechanics. But Acquire is truly excellent. I initially put off playing this game for a very long time, mostly because of seemingly boring the theme of buying and selling stocks. Well, after playing it I finally realized what I'd been missing and that the theme is actually perfect and not dry at all! It's a great game, don't wait like I did to play it.

Update: I've played it about 150 times now in the past nine or ten years and I have to say that really wish I'd played twice as much.  I don't play nearly enough and I lament that fact very much. This game is definitely in my top 25, if not my top 10 favorites of all time.

When one gets down to it, Acquire is sort of a tactical gambling game. There is quite a bit of luck here, but players must use the information they have to guess where the tiles will be placed.

The luck factor is a bit higher than I'd like and the amount of in-game accounting can be tedious, but I still enjoy it because it's easy to teach and almost always plays out very tensely.

There's a reason this game is still played 50 years after its release - now if Avalon Hill / Wizards / Hasbro would just release a new version with better components, it might get to the table even more often than it does.

The next time one of my family members suggests Monopoly, I'm going to see if they will play this instead -- a much more enjoyable real-estate game, with elegant simplicity and many interesting decisions.  The new Avalon Hill edition, with the plastic hotels, is very nice.

RATING: 7
Absolutely brilliant in its simplicity and depth.

The standard rules are not meant for two players, but that's how I've been playing it. As a 2p game using rules for 3+ players, it seems to suffer from a runaway leader problem. The suggested 2p rules suffer from too much randomness. I will try to think of a solution for that.

RATING: 8.5
Acquire has easy setup and only a few basic mechanics to learn, but the game varies every time and different rivalries and friendships emerge. Ultimately, it is a hit-or-miss game based on the crowd, but a fun one for those willing to get into it.

I ranked it higher because for a game of this solid of design and ability to be learned quick and enjoyed by more casual gamers. Still can take 1.5-2 hours to play.

Have played probably 5 times, and have yet to win (though have come extremely close). Still can't believe this came out originally in 1962! How come I never found out about this game until 2005??? Update (Jan 12, 2008): 6th time the charm... I was runaway winner by at least 15,000... and my 7th time as well, I came from last place to 1st in a weird session. 

Note: I will only play this game with open stocks (but closed money)... otherwise unless you have good memory as to who has majority/minority, it's like playing in the dark (does make game go much faster with closed stocks but for me just no fun and random)

I've only played this game once.  I found the theme and strategy dull, the game shockingly dry and overlong.  I gave it a 3 initially, but having had a bad dream in which I was expected to play this again, I had to lower it to a 2.  If it ever pops up in my sub-conscious again, it's going down to a 1.

This game doesn't do much for me - and it's not that it's an abstract with a thinly pasted on theme.  It's just dull.  Maybe I need to play it in person?  I've played perhaps 15 games online - enough to get some basic strategy down, having won a few games, and there's just no spark of interest for me.  Maybe I just don't like laying tiles on a grid (T&E is not for me, nor is Go)?  It could be the spatial aspect that I don't like, even though it isn't particularly strong in Acquire.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2010)

Acquire is an "Acquired" taste :P. I didn’t like it a bit the first few plays (the original rating was around 5.0) but I’m beginning to see why so much people like the game. It has luck but almost always the best player is the winning one. It is not an easy game, it has a steep learning curve but I totally recommend it. This is a classic and a true gamer’s game.

In general, new players don’t know what to do and this often leads to unintentional kingmaking.

I love to play with hidden information.

I like Acquire a lot. It is amazing to me that a game so old can be still so good. Sid Sackson was indeed a great designer. Acquire rules are mind-numbingly easy but the game has a huge depth, every move counts and I still learn new things every time I play it.

The game components of the Avallon Hill edition are great, the 3M edition are also very good. I still haven’t played with the new edition but I have heard the components are very regular. 

As I wrote before, I always like when a game has a memory component, so I love to play Acquire with hidden shares.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2017)

I really like Acquire, a game with a permanent spot among my game collection. I was happy to learn Hasbro was printing a new edition as the 2008 one wasn’t very good components’ wise.

The new edition of Acquire changes some rules of the game. First and most important now the third place on the mergers also wins some money. I’m not sure how I feel about this, but perhaps it makes the game more strategic and reduces a little bit the luck factor, overall I think I like this change, it also makes the game a lot easier and forgiving. Second, they made the board smaller, this impact when a corporation is safe and when the game´s end. I don’t like this change as much, but it is a minor issue. Third, there are less shares per corporation, this doesn’t bother me.

Acquire´s new components are great looking, but as is usual from Hasbro, they dropped the ball, this time with the board. They, obviously, didn´t test it. It is very hard to see the numbers on the board. In our game (and the games of many friends) players have made mistakes because they cannot see clearly the coordinates, they are too obscure. A friend solved this painting them white but I’m very disappointed by this. To add insult to injure, Hasbro also chose a font that is hard to read as well. Both of these deficiencies lead to players making mistakes when they play.

Bottom line, the new components are great, but the usability of the game decreased a lot due to the obscure board and the font they used. I´m very disappointed by this, I won’t replace my old copy of the game.  You can read my opinion of the game in the other entry. The current rating for my old copy of Acquire is 7.0.

Played a couple of times with two, and once with four. Is this the precursor for Tigris and Euphrates? I don't just mean in a casual "it's tile laying" way... this is build a company/kingdom which is actually commonly "owned", merge them together the largest wins and the majority stockholder/ruler benefits. Four players is how this game works best I think. We played with open stock holdings.

RATING: 8
I've turned the corner on this game, I think.  After a long while where I refused to play because my group played with closed shares, I finally played, did reasonably well (3rd out of 6) and generally enjoyed myself.  I still prefer the game with open shares as I just don't care for burning my brain tracking information.

This is the stock game distilled to its very core.  Unlike in many other stock games, where valuation of the stock presents the primary challenge, Acquire has always seemed to me to play more like an area majority game, as the bonuses are very clear and open to everyone who wants to count the tiles on the board.  And yet I like it anyway, probably for the same reason I like El Grande despite my general distaste for the mechanic.  Implemented well, area control games can be packed with tension, and Acquire's uncertainty of payouts provides the tension that even cousins like El Grande lack with their fixed payout systems.

Rating is a composite of a 7 for closed shares, and a 9 for open shares.  The annoyance of having to track the shares is that pronounced for me, though I can see the case for viewing the closed-shares variant as a better game.  It might be, but I find it significantly less fun because my disinterest in tracking information puts me at a disadvantage.

I very much enjoy the strategy (which is deep and challenging) and the randomizing factor of the hidden tiles.

There is a thrill to backing one particular hotel chain and trying to get it to 11 before it can be acquired. This is a well-designed game.

I'd play it more often if it weren't for the tendency to run long and push away new players due to the learning curve on the strategic elements.

God, could I suck more please?

A classic game, great strategy, can be brutal, you can be out of the game with no chance to catch up VERY early in the game, but you can still influence events and the shape of the game...believe me, I'm very experienced in this role! :)

There are 2 ways to play: open shares--you can see exactly how many each player owns; and hidden shares--you can't see how many each players owns. I strongly prefer the hidden shares. It introduces a bit of memory, a bit of gambling, and more risk yet it reduces none of the strategy.

Open holdings is the best way to start, but it leads to slow games and trite games as the counting becomes a crutch for folk every single round and every single action. Open shares does allow an almost perfect information game...but it sucks the fun out of the game for me.

Late to the party as usual, 49 years after this came out (it's the same age as me) I finally get to play it. At least I got to play the classic AH bookcase edition - always a pleasure to pull a bookcase game off the shelf.

Turns out it's a Euro-style stock market/financial game (i.e. a numbers optimiser, albeit just about the original) but it has a number of twists that still make it attractive. 

I like the spatial elements on the board (many number optimisers are nothing but just that), I also like the drive to build up majorities in minor companies with the intention of having other companies buy them out while you are the majority shareholder - easier said than done.

Like many modern optimisation games (hello Powergrid) the end game slows down frustratingly as players try to optimise their final score in the last few plays, otherwise sound.

A classic...there's a pretty big luck factor in this one but it doesn't bother me.  The only downside for me on this one is that it can be frustrating to play with new folks who aren't familiar with the intricate strategy involved in this one. One of my all time favorites.  

***Update***
I think I'm the odd man out but I've always played this with hidden shares although the number left is public knowledge.  I've talked to some who hide money.  Still others play with completely open knowledge of shares and money.  I'm not sure I'd like that.  Think it would remove some of the tension from the game.  Overall, a classic and a title I don't imagine will get traded away.

I think this game is good for 3 players.  More than 3, you may have less control of the board than necessary.  The only problem I've had with the game is during some sessions, you'll have a situation where one of the players is shut out of the mergers and is cash short.  This can turn this fun game into a long drawn out affair with little chance to catch up to the leaders.   There are some alternate payout charts that I would like to try at some point

Each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock. As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.

Only played this the once in a three player game. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to play it again.  I was told this was like monopoly but this is quite different. I definitely enjoy this game far more. This game flows really well. It never dragged and although in the game I played it took a while for the first takeover to happen I was told that was unusual.  The rules are simple enough once you have played a few rounds and the game is intuitive enough that I was able the plan strategys before we had it mid game in my first play. I would definitely play this again and wouldn't turn down a game. A solid game from a master game designer. I'm proud to have this one in my collection.

It's frustrating to me when I want to be able to merge two companies and I can't seem to draw a tile needed to cause the merger I want. I'm also a little put off with the hidden information regarding stock ownership since people who are good at remembering hidden information have a slight edge. My group has since implemented a house rule of having stock public to level the playing field in that regard.

Ultimately, I prefer Stephensons' Rocket to this game since players have more control over what happens.

Most turns in Acquire revolve around a key question - do I expand or merge a chain now, or wait while I quietly try to gain cheap shares or a majority in the chain? There is a significant bluffing element where you try to buy shares to set up future plays without signaling to the other players your intentions. I think what makes a tile-laying game great, is that the tiles played continue to have meaning through to completion. Since chain size determines value and payout, tile plays certainly hold their meaning to the end. Bad choices early can doom you to having little or no money for much of the game.

It's the luck factor that keeps this from being a 10.

Not very good as a two-player or as a six-player.

RATING: 8
The more you play the faster it goes, but with 6 there can be some downtime. If you buy stock until you run out of money, you will either win the game when you are lucky with the first mergers or you will have to look at it without anything to do for the rest of the game when you are unlucky. It takes a while before you realise this. Over all I like it, though. (10 jan 09 after 9 plays)

RATING: 6
A classic intro to commodity speculation for those who would otherwise be uninterested in the topic. Think of it as a natural transition from monopoly. However, if players specifically want a commodity speculation game, skip Acquire and go right to Chicago Express, Container, or Modern Art as better starters. 

As for Acquire proper, it is EXTREMELY dependent upon players of equal skill. With less skillful players all I have to do is count cards (i.e stocks) to stay in the money. Finding the optimal move each time is too easy, I find that I play this game on auto-pilot and still manage to win 95% of our plays. The random tile draws are swingy though not terribly annoying. I have little desire to play this unless it's as an introduction or with highly skilled players. I appreciate its history and contributions to gaming but it just isn't an evergreen for me. 

WIFE RATING - 7

RATING: 6
This is a classic, solid game, but I have two issues with it:  (1) There's alot of luck involved in drawing the tile that allows you to merge two companies, which can be a decisive play and (2) unless you play with open shares, it really favors those with a photographic or really accurate memory, not a factor I favor in games.

Still one of the best ever financial games. Can't comment much more as I have not played it in years. 

Introduced it to some people I worked with back in the 80's. Two of them loved it so much, they got in the habit of playing it every lunch time. they got to know the game so well they could play three or even four games in an hour, amazing to watch.

Production quality on the 2008 edition sucks. One of the cards is already showing wear after removing it from the plastic wrap. Everything is boring uninspired cardboard!

But you know what, I really enjoyed the gameplay! The way the game evolved was very interesting.

I think the sweet spot is 3 players. With 4, it seemed to drag a little. Doesn't help when some players suffer from AP. Some of your destiny is determined by the luck of the draw and without pulling the right tiles, it can be difficult to judge what hotels are going to be valuable.

RATING: 7
A classic investing game in which you place tiles on a board to "grow" companies you own stock in. If a tile touches two companies, they merge, and the owners of the smaller company are paid out dividends. The key choices to make are which companies to invest in, how heavily to invest, and which tiles to hold back for timely mergers. 

As a ~50 year old game, the established fan base divides into two camps: open shares or closed shares. With closed shares there is a heavy memory aspect, which the fans of that style of play are comfortable ignoring. With open shares the game becomes a little bit bland. Still good, but not remarkable. I prefer open but even then Acquire is a "once-in-a-while" game. It might be fun with the family but there are better choices for that scenario.

Great stock ownership game that remains relevant decades after it was produced. The game play is simple but the decisions are not. Most of your decisions revolve around when to cash out of companies and when to hold on to the stock for future gains.

I main criticism is that there is just a tad more luck than I like, however for a 6 player game that plays in 75 minutes it's not too much luck. Imperial is a better game with open info and much more to think about but plays in at least twice the time as Acquire. If you like Imperial but find it doesn't get to the table as often as you'd like because of the time investment than try this out it might scratch that itch for you.

The cracks don't show, despite it's age. Whether it's the recent cheap, cardboard version, or the blinged out plastic of the AH version, this game always delivers. While a little dependent on the tiles you pull and place, it can be mitigated by clever stock purchases.

If there is a game that is a true modern classic then it is Acquire. For its time it was a breakthrough design. Compared with today's games it is abstract and a bit bland, especially when played on one of the original 3M editions. Remarkably, the abstract mechanisms fit the theme of mergers & acquisitions perfectly. It couldn't be more contemporary in the way that the shareholders of the overtaken company often are the real winners. It's great to see such a basic design esteemed highly today and I personally enjoy it more than many overchromed modern economic games. The game end calculations could be less tedious though.

A game that will get played a lot due to being acceptable to everyone, even though not the first choice of anyone. I suspect Acquire is fundamentally 90% luck, so I'm not really sure why it's acceptable to everyone. There must be some kind of a illusion of control there.

I'm sorry I didn't discover this game sooner.  Had I grown up with this type of game I might have gotten into gaming much sooner.

I've also got a near-complete 1999 set that I either want to complete (need three sets of stock cert cards plus 5 Zetas) or to part out to others who need items to complete their beloved 1999 big-box.

We also own a flawless 1963 3M set that we do not ever play. :-)

A most important thing in this game is to tackle the mid-game money shortage. Because of that, first you are forced to make some short term investments. On the other hand, there is nothing better than to see how investing in two-tile corporation earns you big money at the end. Almost everything in this game is right: limited shares, a little bit of luck in the drawn tiles, forbidding players to sell their shares any time, they want, etc.

Acquire fully deserves its classic status. It is a solid design in which you have to have a bit of a different mindset when comparing to all the other stock market games I've played. The stakes in the acquired company matter in the mergers during the game much more than the stakes in the acquiring company, but towards the end this dynamic turns upside down. Suffers a bit from the reality that if you don't get the right tiles early on to force the right mergers you may just run out of money and turn into a bystander.

This game is the oldest that receives a high rating from me. My main concern is the memorization element surrounding stock holdings.

RATING: 7
I have a love hate relationship with this game. Either you get a merger early and get ahead or you just hope the luck of the draw changes down the line and you can catch back up.

Still though, of all the strategy games that are like this, I enjoy this one more due to it's uncomplicated nature using the same 'win by draw' mechanic.

Some will debate that you can still out strategize people. Sure, if you play with a bunch of lesser lifeforms or play it a lot more than someone else sure... but then no one else has any fun either.

A game I played and enjoyed as a kid, but have grown to appreciate more as I've become a "gamer".  The one page rulebook and simple turn structure makes the game lightning-quick to learn, but the strategies and tactics required to play well are rather deep.  The restrictions inherent to the turn sequence force lots of agonizing decisions.  One of the best!

Grand Old Game of the economic stock and merger persuasion, with an impressive legacy. The random tile draw makes the board element seem less appealing than that of, say, Stephenson's Rocket.

A pure stock game, absolutely addictive. 

It doesn't show its age at all. Fast, and very highly recommended, although I wouldn't play it with more than four. MAYBE five if people were desperate, but it'd be a horrible game if everything depended on happening to draw the right tile in the opening and get the right bonus stock as might be the case. Best if you're a huge investor with enough capital to spread it around rather than some sucker with a pension so small as to not be worth diversifying.

For those seeking this game, the best version to get is the Avalon Hill version from 1999.  It has the nicest components, but comes in a fairly large box, so that can be a downside to someone who travels with their games a lot.

Yes, it depends a lot of the tiles you draw - but nevertheless you have a several tiles to select from. So it's not a complete lottery and planning is possible.

Good game.  Pretty straightforward and easy to learn.  Plenty of strategy (with a good mix of luck involved).  Much better alternative to Monopoly or any other financial game I have played.  This is an interesting game in that I never really suggest it and am not overly thrilled to play it when it is suggested by others, but ALWAYS enjoy playing.  Very tense moments...

EDIT:  The more I play this game, the more I think there is a serious flaw.  If you get shut out of the first merge and you don't get into a merge within your next turn or two, you are hosed for the rest of the game.

At first glance, dry and complicated, then, once playing, seemingly static and minimalistic, with only a few decisions, but, finally, observed as a singular elegantly designed work of genius.  Mainly good to play with gamers, though, because of the first and second points.

Still a good game.  The basic stock collection and merger theme has been redone to good effect in several newer games, and so this doesn't get much play time.  I enjoy it on occasion, though.

Even though there is the luck factor with the draw of the tiles, I still am facinated by this game that I keep coming back to it.  Oldie but a goodie.  The new 2008 reprint is alittle lacking compared to previous printings, but they did make it affordable.

Played 2 player, would like to play with more, though 2 works well with the game provided rule modifications.

Very tense throughout and tough decisions to make.  You have to be careful with your decisions, the more you make, the less you have.  If you over extend, you find yourself with nothing to do until a merger happens.  It's similar to using all your meeples in Carcasonne.

1st game took 2.5 hours to finish, but was very easy to learn.

Main detractor is its dryness as you find yourself examining a grid of numbers.

Avalon Hill/Hasbro edition. Personally I like the hotel theme better than the corporation theme, and the box is just too big in this edition. Can be frustrating if you're not getting needed tiles and other players are, but it can also be a lot of fun to play, too, and it's a good length.

My broter introduced this game to the family and we've since all bought a copy off of ebay.  I love the simplistic strategy of this game. A real gem!

Invest in stocks of hotel chains hoping to be the majority holder when the hotel merges with another. Will you trade your stock in for stock in the new hotel, or hang on to it hoping the hotel chain will reappear? Great game.

I had the 1999 Avalon Hill/Hasbro Large Box Edition and it's perfect in every way as an Acquire fan.  Unfortunately, nostalgia factor aside, I started to realize that I was not playing or championing this game any longer in favor of others.  There are quite a few that deal with stock in a better and more thematic way now from Airlines Europe to, well even something like Cable Car.  But the one that really replaced Acquire for me was Lords of Vegas as it also has a similar grid like layout and mergers.  I highly recommend that one.

How did I miss this for most of my life???  This Sid Sackson classic was decades ahead of its time.  Play is very simple - just play a tile and buy some stock - but doing well takes some skill and a little bit of luck.  It rewards being able to anticipate which hotel chains will merge next, as well as getting the timing right in switching over from getting quick cash to investing in the long term.  More than anything, it's a family-friendly game that is lots of fun!

this is a game I can appreciate for it's elegance and depth, however I am terrible at it.  The reason I gave this a 6 and not a 7/8 is due to the fact most people who don't know what they are doing (including me) run out of money quickly and sit the whole game doing nothing.  That doesn't make the game "bad" but it means it's hard to defend to new and bad players who constantly get screwed by people who are very good.

This game was conceived and released before many of the modern gaming mechanics were used.

I love it.

However in the one game I played one player was making basic errors all the time leaving him last but handing lots of cash too the winner that way. (Merging two companies, with no interest in the smaller company and having a very small majority before the merger (so that after the merger he would have the least stock in that company....

Hope my next play won't get disturbed by a number of bad plays (allthough a few small mistakes are welcome)
 
If next play is better it's a 9

next play was very hectic which resulted in a coinflip at the start i think. Player order was against me so I couldn't merge but was merged. Probably had a coupleof opportunities to do better but concentration was low.

Rating remains but I can't see it drop

March 4, 2011: Blocking other players seems to be a big theme in this game, which I don't like. Also, initiating mergers means you announce your strategy first with regards to what you're doing with the cards of the acquired hotel, which makes it a mistake to initiate mergers. This just leads to avoidance and blocking the entire game. Not fun. (4.5)

Very simple rules, and easy to teach. That it's a stock game buying game in which you win by having the most money means makes it understandable to anyone who has played Monopoly. But it can be  counter-intuitive (the company isn't really yours and also you want your company to to get swallowed for the cash bonus). There's a lot to consider, like: what company will be the largest the end of the game?  But you want that cash bonus -- how far do you push up a company's size before placing the tile that will have it taken over, because you don't want your company to get too big, not yet.

Never has a board so bland looking looked so interesting and caused so much tension.

Sid Sackson should have got a Nobel Prize for this game. It is an excellent game which has stood the test of time. People can be found playing it at conventions, on-line, house cons and family groups. The luck balances out and it is the skill of where to invest that produces winners. Of all the share dealing games that have been produced over the years this is still one of the best and would be one of my Desert Island Games.

After playing it twice, I can recognize that this was an amazing game in its day. It must have been a treat for the gamers of those days to play a game so ahead of its time. Unfortunately, it faces some stiff competition in this day and age. The game seems to suffer from a runaway leader problem as the rich get richer. Without the right tiles to make mergers that show you as the main benefactor, you'll quickly find yourself sunk as you watch the guy who was  in the right place at the right time breeze on to victory. I recognize that there is some more strategy to the game than I'm letting on, but it didn't seem to click after two plays. Perhaps we need to play with hidden shares. [b]5[/b]

The "bingoboard" is a nice idea but if you have only bad tiles then you are in a BIG trouble: I've seen everytime when I've played this "classic", that couple of players made fusions all the time (just right tiles in the hand) and because they had the right stocks they got the money. Other players have nothing to do. Whee...

This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher. Each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock. As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.

Many plays.  What I dislike most about Acquire is that, in every game I've played, if a player doesn't found one of the first 6 corporations (gets 4 stocks), they won't win.  This has been invariant in our games.  We play with closed stock.  Bizarrely, I still like the game; strangely compelling.

The archetypal stock taking game with a random scrabble like tile laying mechanic to grow the companies.  The randomness and gamy aspect is very typical of early American boardgames but there's a core of strategy here that's rare for that period.  It's been mostly replaced by smarter & heavier alternatives like Chicago Express, Imperial, Airlines and Samarkand.

RATING: 3
I think the main problem with this game it that it is hard to graps the concept of the game's economy. It's hard to plan ahead a strategy or to even know if you are making or losing money. Still, this syndrome might only affect newbies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a real classic masterpiece by a truly great designer.  I think I really like this with a full complement of 6 players.  Better to warn newbies about why one should merger only if you're in first majority and in some cases 2nd.  This gem takes a good deal of getting used to so there is a learning curve to it.  Then, of course, there's the never ending debate of open holdings vs. closed holdings...  I prefer open b/c I don't believe this should be a memory game.  

The 1999 Avalon Hill/Hasbro premium edition is superb and best edition thus far.  [posted as of Dec2009]

I also tend to have a great time with Wolfgang Kramer's Tycoon, or the Rio Grande version of Shark (aka "Acquire's evil twin brother"), or Alan Moon's Union Pacific - for which they all have some similiarities with.

Interesting stock taking game. Not bad, but it doesn't blow my socks off at all. I think I appreciate Shark much better than this one, and that one has a few more things that I enjoy in a game. With that being said this one isn't a bad game, and I would certainly play it again if someone wanted to play.

Ultimately my main objection to this game is that it does not allow you sell stocks whenever you like.

I have only recently had the opportunity to play this game for the first time.  It must have been outstanding in its day and it still provides an excellent gaming experience.  In my one game, I've already had the experience of being shut out of the benefits of the early mergers by a poor tile draw.  I don't consider the level of randomness a major problem, however, as I think the game has enough meat on its bones generally to balance the luck factor with opportunities for clever play.

RATING: 3
Acquire is a game about hotel merger and acquisition.  Very abstract for this kind of game as to the takeover occurs when two tiles of different colors touches on the square game board, rather than a diligent financial anaylsis of profitability from merging together.  Strange to me as a financial guy.  The buying and selling of shares are also a bit off-the-board as to the rising and decline of share price is determined by more or less randomness.  Strategy?  Yes, a little.  Good for casual play but don't beleive the game could give you some insight to the actual financial market operations.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Every game I've played of this has been very enjoyable. The concept is simple and strong players can still be undone by the luck of failing to draw that crucial merger tile.

Can be cumbersome checking the share price regularly with the provided tables, but none the less a timeless game that is made by the theme implementation.

[b]This classic tile laying stock game of mergers and acquisitions remains engaging despite its lackluster components and simple game play.[/b]
[color=red][i]Arguably Sid's finest design which has stood the test of time.[/i][/color]

SYNOPSIS
Numbered and lettered tiles are placed from one's hand in turn onto a grid representing buildings being erected in a cityscape. Players vie for controlling interest in a business by buying stock in the companies. Eventually buildings will merge together due to board constraints. At that time when businesses fold into one another creating larger companies, stock investments are paid out for those holding shares of the companies. The winner is the one who accumulates the most wealth after the game's end when a final payout of existing buildings occurs for stockholders.

COMMENTS
Though I don't own this, I do enjoy playing Acquire whenever anyone brings it to a game night. It's easy to explain, and the puzzle aspect of where best to build businesses combined with when best to buy stock makes for thoughtful consideration of capital investment strategies in order to "one up" your opponents.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ Teaching this game is simple.
+ There are opportunities to position oneself well through clever tile placement or timely investing.
- Though good strategy is rewarded, players can get caught feeling left behind or left out of the big payouts due to unexpected circumstances.
* Different versions are aesthetically more appealing than others, but this can usually be found inexpensively at thrift stores and garage sales since several editions have been published over the years.

The first time I played this was with a friend while we were in Germany. He pulled out this game and taught me how to play. The game is mostly a waiting game and not overly difficult but it is a game where a new player will usually get crushed the first play. It is hard to know which tile to lay down in the beginning and what to invest in when you aren't familiar with the game. However, after the first game this game is great. My rating is based on the fact that there is a lot of luck (drawing tiles) and when you run out of money it can be a little boring. Overall a good game.

RATING: 10
This should be right up there with Monopoly, Scrabble, Risk, Stratego, and so forth as a Classic American Game. It's easy to learn, easy to play, and has tons of strategy. Also, don't be put off by the "horrible" production quality of the most recent edition. It plays just fine, as do the older versions. The gameplay is what shines here; you don't need big plastic toys to appreciate it.

I was surprised to find out how old this Ameritrash is. It truly captures the tension and cut-throat environment of stocks and acquisitions. Every turn you will have tough decisions on which stocks to buy, how to value each of them and you will need the ability to forecast correctly the next possible mergers. Truly a class of its own especially for such an old game. I'm glad I've gotten the chance to play this and would love to own an antique version of this game.

This is a very cutthroat Euro that as I found out can be quite unforgiving if you have no money. There's a lot of clever stock speculation in this game, and knowing when you should acquire (to raise value), be acquired (to get cash or to trade for a different company to get majority in that company), start focusing on a new company or avoid other people. How other people value things can really mess with your plans. Overall while it appears really abstract it is very true to its capitalist theme. Very ahead of its time and I can see why it became so popular. Nowadays it is probably not for everyone: as I said the game can be quite punishing for bad plays and there might be a bit of a runaway leader in that if you can acquire value early, you can potentially cash out and continue acquiring more value. However, it still holds a unique, capitalism simulation, simple yet clever niche in the hobby.

This is surprisingly fun and fast. I wasn't originally excited to play this game as I looked at the box and components and thought, "Ugh, grown up Monopoly".

Favorite all time game, Acquire is what made me a gamer.  Yes it is a economic strategy game, but it is so clean that I have to call it a family game.  It was always the game that was pulled out when aunts/uncles, cousins, and friends came over. As an adult and we had game night it was always played at least once.  I will still play it at the drop of a hat. Only drawback is that this is not a 2 or 3 person game.

In this game you build hotel chains by linking more tiles to the original chain. The bigger a chain grows the more the stocks in it are worth. Money is payed out to the majority and minority stockholder when a chain is bought out out. There are a few more rules, but the overall rules are very simple. The play is complex, however, and unparalleled. One last note, this game should not be played with less than 4 players. At less than four players it bogs down and the closer you can get to the full 6 player count, the better.

Got in trade for Diamant.
Picked up in Jan 2006
I still want the Hasbro edition.

Sold the 3M edition to Emily in early 2015.

Picked up the newer AH/WotC edition cheap in mid 2015. 

Finally got to play in Dec 2015. Ebayed a 3M edition that night. Came with Lloyd's variants.
Emily traded the 3M edition I had sold her back to me for the WotC edition.

June 2016 built custom tile set for a spare 1999 board picked up cheap on ebay.

Late 2016/early 2017 managed to get a reasonable Hasbro edition from a local seller. Box is quite worn, but otherwise the rest of the components are great.

During my university days I've played exhaustively a borrowed copy of 1995 AH Acquire with my classmates. Now we're all very busy at work/ family and can hardly meet, maybe 1 or 2 times per year. I brought this game out at my regular gathering so as to familiar with the rules and try it with my regular game-mates.
Many of them commented this game as heavily luck dependent, which, in my opinion, is a wrong observation. This game has quite a bit of luck, and it is usually down to a single tile to determine who's the winner. But luck won't make a good player comes out at last or make a bad player becomes the winner. Is it not the aim of Eurogames, in which experience does matter, but the novice still see a chance to win the game?

while many in my group like it, and I like it ok, this game is frustrating to me.  1) I do not see how to lay the tiles with any great strategy in mind.  I can usually see the optimal tactical move, but I cannot develop a strategy. 2) I seem to never be able to be in on the swallowed up company, thereby not receiving much needed funds.  But I will not give up.

So simple, yet I consistently suck at this game since I can never predict what is going to happen.  I love how the randomness of the game makes for infinite playability.  Maybe a bit abstract for a fair representation of corporate mergers, which is my one critique, that and the board and tiles are not appealing, but otherwise its simplicity makes it extremely playable.

Great addition to my collection. As everyone said this game hasn't aged a bit. Super fun game this.

I think that 4 is a sweet spot for this as it is slow to develop and up until you get those tiles to start the mergers, can be pretty boring to begin with. With 4 the mergers start to happen faster and then the game really shines.

RATING: 8
This is a more recent acquisition for us, but it plays as smoothly as current "redesigns" of older games. I can't believe I waited so many decades to play this, or that I wasted so many hours playing Monopoly through the years. I'd give my right eye to have played this instead. All in all, this is a solid economic game with easy rules and a lot of depth. I am excited to have purchased the pretty Hasbro version now, but the game is so solid that any edition works well. This is an Absolute Classic and Highly Recommended!

(Review refers to AH bookshelf format edition)  A classic.  Almost certainly the board game I've played more than any other.  Rewards forward planning (although this can be frustrated by an uncooperative distribution of tiles) and an ability to envisage how the board might look in 5 to 10 turns time.  Hard to fault.

It simply is a classic. Try to buy the right stock and make the right decisions to stay in the game, because once you are out, there is no turning back. That makes it very exciting, but also very disappointing sometimes. 

The winner is revealed only at the very end of the game.

I like this game.  There are so many possible strategies.  End game scoring can be a real chore and that is why the overall score suffers.  Simple to teach and difficult to master.  No wonder this relic still enjoys a following today.  This is the true Monopoly.

Despite hating paper money, this game is pretty good.  It fills a need for finance themed games.  Although the tile draw/placement mechanic can seem a bit random, there is still a fair bit of strategic planning and thinking available.  The accounting for final scoring is cumbersome.  I may make an excel program to aid with this.

Buen juego, de mucha calidad sus materiales. Tal vez el factor suerte podría ser un poco más bajo. De hecho, con 5 jugadores, es muy, demasiado importante estar en las dos primeras fusiones. Quien no lo está, ve como sus acciones en las otras empresas valen cada vez menos, porque quienes tenían en las empresas fusionadas, adquieren gran cantidad de dinero que les permite hacerse con la mayoría en las otras empresas.
Le he  bajado la puntuación ultimamente, porque es un poco caótico. Es difícil de predecir por donde se producirán las fusiones. En síntesis, ello redunda en la dificultad de planificar, porque factores externos influyen mucho, incluída la suerte.

What can I add, really?  

This is a timeless classic, and was the bridge game that got me past Monopoly, Risk and Scrabble.  It was in the middle of a 4-player game of Scrabble about 12 years ago that a friend of mine rushed wildly into the room, rather rudely pushed the Scrabble board aside and presented us instead with this ugly plastic grid and a bunch of plastic tiles, saying "Put that away and let's play a REAL game."  We laughed out loud and dismissed him as a raving lunatic at the time, but now I realize what a favor he was trying to do for me.  I gave in and played Acquire the next time I was over, and it was the first time I'd ever been confronted in a game by the delicious need to choose the *best few* of the many desirable (no, CRITICAL!) options available to me.  I was hooked immediately.  I have been sinking into an ever-deepening pool of Geekhood ever since.

Brilliant.  Would love to play far more often as I still don't entirely understand the strategy.  My parents owned a 3M copy, and without that I'd probably never have started playing boardgames. 

I've moved this game back to 10, but I admit its a game that I actually don't understand.  It's random, but seemingly not too random.  It's nasty, but seemingly has little player interaction.  It's economic, but you seldom make money.  It plays beautifully, and maybe that's what I enjoy.  It is surely the design that launched eurogames... it just took a couple decades to hear the echo.

I didn't really start to appreciate this until I played computer versions a number of times, learning the strategies. A bad set of tiles (esp. in the beginning) can hamper a player, but mostly you have to make your own luck through good choices. I think the monetary lookup table and so much currency handling or the most dated aspects of the game, but there's no denying its amazing longevity, innovation, and good balance of stratefy and luck (about 70/30, I'd say).

A solid 7, by the book -- usually willing to play it.

Pretty fine mix of skill and luck, though I guess, like any game with luck, it can get a bit out of hand in any given session.

What keeps it from going higher? Mostly niggles and nitpicks. Not that fun squinting at the silly little chart, though I'm sure there are downloadable versions that are easier on the eyes.

Not that good for 'non-gamers' either. 

Early blunders, miscalculations or terrible luck can be costly, leading to a long night, but otherwise fun, challenging and engaging.

I realize that this is a "classic" game but I think that the game is largely dependent upon tile draw and can become broken if a second merger does not take place soon after the first.  I always thought a game like this would be a lot better if there were more options to it (like being able to sell stock and such).  I found the original rules that Sid Sackson wrote on a web-site somewhere, and thought that they might make for a much better game.

Wow what a great game. I'm mad i never got to play this game growing up. After i played Power Grid, i loved the variable market mechanic, and was searching for something else in the same vein..that's when i stumbled upon Acquire! My version from 1968 really gives off a nostalgic vibe, so i don't even mind the paper money, and has nice plastic pieces. i can't imagine playing with the newer reprint that has cardboard tiles. This game has a little bit of randomness factor, which irks me, but it's not terrible. If you liked the variable market from Power Grid, you'll enjoy Acquire, as playing that market is the entire game.

Tom Vasal 2008 GOTY List Game 82
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.47
Rating:

Game quality: A game this old and this solid feels like it should get at least an 8 by default. But, I hate the "dead" turns where your placing of a block essentially feels like it does nothing. Sure, you can still deal with stocks but that one random tile might turn into something for another player before it does for you and that aspect grates at me more than it should. It is kind of a bucket list game that gamer's should at least play. I think it still serves its purpose as a gateway networking game. 7.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: *sigh* I doubt it and that's a shame. The dead turn issue sinks this just enough and knowing there are numerous stock/networking games that came later which eventually did the idea even better makes this hard to justify again. Airlines Europe is just one example, and I know this despite not even playing it yet. Some day I will likely send off Acquire to a proper home and add in Airlines Europe. I still want to get my fill of it though. 4.

Do I want to play this if asked: Very likely. 7.

Overall: 7.47.

Rating Potential: About as high as it will go at 7.47. It did a stellar job being as good as it is for as long as it did.

This was the game I cut my early gaming teeth on.  I loved it and played it to death.  Nostalgia keeps its rating high for me but I don't reach for it like I used to.   Once exposed to a larger smorgasbord of games, Acquire feels a bit dated. I'm not fond of the memory element of trying to remember who is buying which stock. That said however, I wouldn't turn it down if that's what a group wanted to play.

Addictive. My family has the AH/Hasbro version, which is worth big bucks but I hope they never sell it. Simple mechanics, but some subtle money-management strategies. Only play though if you don't mind tracking how many stocks of which companies other people have purchased. This knowledge is crucial for good play.

If you're not involved in the first merger and have to wait a while until one of your chains gets taken over then you have lost the game. Simple as that. Too much dependant on luck to make this worth putting on the table.

RATING: N/A
For a game consisting only of putting numbered tiles in specified locations on a grid, the theme works so well.  I feel like I'm a big shot invester.  My hand of shares is my portfolio.  My hand of tiles is my research and/or inside information.  Watch your rival investors closely - they might have some "inside info" of their own!

RATING: 9
There's a reason this game has been around as long as it has and that's because it's excellent!  Strategy is subtle but easy enough for beginners to pick up within one or two plays.  The escalating structure of stocks forces action after sizes get to a certain point.  Even players that are not in the running for winning can still improve upon their positions and stay a part of the game until the end through acquiring stock and trying for end of game bonuses.  The game is a masterpiece!  (It is possible for someone who has not been part of a merger to be left out of buying stock in future rounds.  Though this can be mitigated somewhat, it does happen and is about the only reason not to rate this a 10 alongside Diplomacy)

RATING: 8
Acquire is a truly classic game. An experienced player will always beat a newbie which to me is the sign of a good game. It means that skill is rewarded and there is some depth to the game. However, the learning curve is not too steep and a new player will be competitive very quickly. With players of equal skill luck is often a large factor. To me, the key decision in the game is when to switch from assuring cash flow (selling your shares after a merger) to going for the majority in the final companies (trading in your shares 2 for 1 after a merger). In the beginning you need that cash because you simply must buy shares every turn. In the mid to end game however, you don't want to get locked out of the final large companies because the end game payouts can be huge.

Fun, can be played quick. I've hear people say the randomness really isn't a big thing, but I don't see it.

I really like this game. 
Maybe it is the memory element in remembering the shares (but it is more some kind of "intuition" than actual memorization). Maybe it is the difficult task of telling who is ahead until the end (and thus less leader-bashing).
All in all, a classic.

I've only played this game a few times, and with the same group, and I've NEVER won. Not even close. Honestly, I don't know how much of my lack of enthusiasm for this game is due to my poor luck at dice and tile games (statistically speaking, I am an anomaly and am violating several rules of the Universe that support theories of random chance... consequently, I no longer believe in "chance"... if there are bad consequences in a game, it WILL happen to me). I do have one gripe with this game, and that is that the person who gets cash from the first merger CLEARLY has an advantage. Regardless, I have enjoyed playing this game and I'm interested in getting some more plays under my belt.

Excellent simulation! fun to play and tactical, many times the winner isn't clear until the very end of the game. The Hasbro reprint I own is kind of crappy, but the artwork is nice and the components are playable. The game works quite well at all player counts, seems simple and quite lucky but is deep in strategy also. So far I'm very impressed with this classic, a top tier game for me.

There's a fair bit of luck in this game, but that's what big business is all about! The name of the game is risk management. The first game was confusing and aimless but since then Acquire has proven itself to be worthy of it's reputation. We play with hidden money and held shares.

Played my first game with honey and mom. Sigh, it gave my honey massive AP and my mom's words were, "I don't just hate it, I despise it." However, my honey said he liked it and so did I. It has an old-school feel, but is actually a well balanced game. An interesting mix of spatial skills, area control, and economics. Much more strategic than it first seems. I will probably like it more once I have a play were people don't bitch and moan the whole way through (that's right mom, I'm looking at you :/). I have the Hasbro version and yes, it is pretty ugly. However the cardboard is thick, everything is easy to see, and it all fits together well. So despite the color scheme obviously being created by a color-blind misanthrope - The components aren't actually poor quality (except for the tile holders... Seriously Hasbro, you couldn't spring for some rejected Scrabble holders?). In fact, I'd rather be forced to look at this board for a month than play even one more game of the Rio Grande version of Medici.

A masterpiece.  Wonderful, wonderful game and the new edition is awesome.  What I think I like most about this game is the way the board evolves.  It is almost organic, but at the behest of the players, so if you study the players' moves, you can tell which way it is growing.  The game rewards you for paying attention.  Also, there is blocking by holding the tiles needed to merge until the company you have can be safe.  It's a cool game.

Acquire is a very good stock purchasing game. At the first glance on the game board it is not interesting. It is a grid with coordinations like "2A", "10F" that looks dull. However, the game play is wonderful. Many strategic possibilities are made by a set of rather simple rules. Excellent. Unfortunately, the new AH edition looks terrible in appearance! (Rating lowered for its poor aesthetics)

Easily one of my favorite games of all time.  If I would have played the cardboard AH edition I probably would have passed, but the 3M and latest AH/Hasbro edition are both superb.  So many good games today owe some homage to this everlasting design.  Definitely a classic.

RATING: 9
If simplicity is the mark of genius, then Acquire is the meaty foundation of Sackson’s overwhelming claim to the title.  The players just do 2 things, place tiles and buy stock, but those 2 actions are the vectors onto a massive field of positional dominance on the board, for shares, even with their ability to generate mid game money.  But the real brilliance is that in a game ultimately about the value of mobility and timing in a speculative market just those 2 actions and handful of tiles give aggressive players the ability to manipulate the game, either to hedge a bet or to trick players into bad investments.  It is simple, smart, and very mean, but what’s more it is and will always be one of the watermarks of good game design so lucky for us it is so gosh darn fun.

Great classic game that I only recently (re)discovered.  Over the years, I always figured it was slow and boring compared to other AH games and SPI wargames.  It is a true classic.

You'll need 1/2-a-game to figure out the general flow and feel, but it gets into high gear thereafter.  Easy to teach.  The production values of the latest version are pretty abysmal, but you can cobble together your own game support aids from BGG.  By all means, try to find colored chips to replace the paper money.  Your game will increase speed by a magnitude.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Build corporations and watch them merge by laying tiles while investing your limited funds in seven possible companies along the way.

Played as: 3,4,5,6 player

Pros: One of those simple but deep games where it takes 10 minutes to understand the rules and flow the first time but kind-of blows your mind after that. Thematically nailed it as the game starts out with a bunch of little mom and pop businesses running their own niche of the board and ends with one 'Walmart' conglomerate absorbing the 'competition'. Overall, a fast satisfying investment game that doesn't over complicate things. 

Cons: Mathy. Having to consult the reference card that's filled with all sorts of numbers then multiply this by how many that... it really can take away from the focus of the game. Not any significant interaction of note, probably the easiest to play in silence. The restrictive nature of the board and tile placement doesn't allow any real freedom to mitigate luck of the draw which is usually the strength of tile laying games. 

Other: Has that, "I want to play it because its challenging but not necessarily because it's fun" feel. I expected to like this game a little more then I did because I'm such a huge fan of tile-laying games. Being that that element of this game is so restricted, it almost doesn't even deserve that classification. As an investment game it's aces though so newcomers should expect that, and only that, to be the lasting draw of the game.

Best Use: A bridging game from non-gamers into something a little more gamer-y.

After ~40 plays.  Classic.  An abstract with simple rules that harbors some kind of ineffable (sp?) magic.  Works amazingly well, but it's hard to say why.  With experience, I've found increasingly that the effects of chance are not nearly as strong as it used to seem they should be.  Newbies have little chance against experienced players, which for me is essential in a strategy game (it's a sign that there is a lot to learn about the game).  The recent AH edition is great; As is true for many games, I prefer using poker chips instead of the paper currency that comes with the game.

It can be frustrating to get bad tiles or to be the person that gets screwed at the beginning (and thus become a non-entity), but a good game nonetheless.

I think this game is more tactical than anything. You have to really be able to roll with the tiles you've picked or you can't possibly win. Merging is the key to winning this game, if you control the merging piece definitely play it to your advantage.

(I have the newer big box AH / Hasbro edition) - I like this classic game and recommend it especially for those venturing into "German" style games for the first time. It is easy to find on the shelves, easy to learn, and has mechanics and strategic concepts you'll still find in later-designed games. It is always fun to take out and play. Despite owning over 1000 games, this one makes it to the table a few times a year at least.

An interesting stock game, completely abstract. I like it, but can see why some people wouldn't. Can feel very random at times with the tile choices - I only give it a 7 using variant rules (common tile pool and one time only sell stock).

Finally got to play this one!  Very simple rule set, but really good game play.  The action is basic and straightforward, stripped to the most basic level.  My one concern is dependence on the tile draw.  Found a copy of the Avalon Hill version for ten Euros, so thought that was a good deal.

A cool stock market game, yes. However, Aquire is all about doing the right thing at the right time. One mess up can really throw your game off and give your opponents the victory.

This was the game that drew me back into boardgames as an adult.  It's a personal classic with an ingenious design.  Wonderful game.  It's only because it's a little too abstract that I don't rate it higher.  I consider this a good gateway game because the rules are straightforward.

Wow, I can see why this is a classic! I really don't understand why Monopoly caught on but not Acquire... that's kind of sad, actually. The game shows its age in places; the endgame in particular is a little wonky, and players can eliminate themselves if they cannot participate in any mergers inthe early half of the game... but who's kidding who, none of that really matters. It's an awesome game.This is my 501st rated game - I wish I'd discovered it a lot earlier. It's to 18xx what Nexus Ops is to TI:3 ;-)

Got to play 1963 version -- very impressed with this well-regarded classic!  Although there seems to be few ways to outright lose money (trade 2-for-1 at a loss), the name of the game is identifying which chains will be most profitable at end game -- the key is _optimizing_ the gaining of money!  I really felt the capitalism flowing throughout.  :)

RATING: 7
So after the first game (solo, 6-fold split personality) I am not all that impressed. It all feels kind of static and the all-or-nothing bonuses are too gamey for my tastes. I do like the general idea of building up for mergers and stuff, but I would like a bit less hidden information and randomness.

I do expect that my evaluation will improve to an 8 eventually. I am not sure, though, whether I can find enough players who might like this. Will be looking for a nicer version (3M is nice to have but a tad ugly.)

RATING: N/A
For all I know this version, "Avalon Hill (Hasbro) German large box edition", is the nicest one, despite being certainly not the rarest. I'd say that usability of the tiles and clarity of where the chains are are of great importance for playing this comfortably.

This was my first stock game.  I enjoyed it on my first play and I think I'll always enjoy it since it introduced me to this type of game.

In acquire you are building up hotels (at least most versions call them hotels), and you are buying stock in those hotels.  At the end of the game you get to sell your stock back and see who has the most money.  Each turn you will add one tile to the board.  If the tile makes a new group of tiles you choose a hotel that isn't in play yet and add it to those tiles.  For starting up the hotel chain you get a free stock in that hotel.  You then are able to buy up to 3 stock in any company or companies that are on the board.  The value of the stock depends on the size of the company which is based on the number of tiles that make up the company.  At the end of your turn you draw a tile to bring your hand back up to 6.  The interesting part comes in with mergers.  If a tile is placed that attaches to two or more companies everything gets merged into the company with the most tiles.  It is very key to be involved in mergers in the beginning and you need to have stock in the company that is being dissolved.  Because the company going away will pay the majority and minority stock holders a handsome bonus, as well as giving those stock holders the option to sell, keep or trade up their stock.  This is important because mergers are the only time you can get more money.  If you run out of money for too many turns it is hard, if not impossible, to catch back up.

I give this a high rating because it is fun having to manage who has what stocks while everything is hiding.  There is a lot of tense decisions trying to decide which company you need to stay up with to keep some majority and minority holdings.  I couldn't go up to a 9 or 10 because there is one major flaw.  If you aren't lucky enough to draw any merger tiles you are at the mercy of those that do.  Sometimes this means companies that you need to merge in order to keep pace with everybody won't get merged.  This isn't a huge deal breaker because it doesn't happen all too often, but it does happen enough to cause some frustrations.

Classic game design that still holds up very well in the current modern board game scene.  How many games published in the early 1960s (or earlier) can make the same claim?

More subtle and strategic than the game might appear at first glance.  I underestimated the game, despite owning it, but not playing it for years.  So my loss.

Eurogame like mechanics in a game published in the 1960s and an influential design.  Likely the precursor to modern tile laying and stock holding games including the 18XX games.

50 years old in 2014 (apparently Acquire was actually published in '64 despite the year on the 3M box).

Genius.  With four players this game just has a nice combination of flow vs. depth vs. game time.  Of course, I just play casually.  And I'm a Sackson fan.  I've always played public stock/private money.  I really don't get to play this as often as I'd like, luckily there are some nice AI versions that I've played a lot - unfortunately for me this doesn't seem to be helping my face to face play.

If you're new to Acquire or have an older edition and you don't know already, be sure to use the newer rules for discarding unusable tiles.

Played twice.  Tactical game of tile placement and stock purchasing; the mechanics are very interesting - players have a set of 6 tiles in front of them, one of which they must play at the start of their turn.  Corporations are groups of adjoining tiles, which can aquire other corporations when their tiles are merged.  Players can buy stock in corporations; the larger (more tiles) a corporation is, the more its stock is worth.  A very tactical resource management game that requires planning ahead, but which has a possibly frustrating amount of randomness.  Must play this more.

Pretty good stock exchange-investing game, although a few times I've run into situations where, even though I've invested in a few different companies, by other players' decisions, my companies stay on the board and overtake smaller companies.  While this may be good for the end game, when it happens near the beginning and I've run out of cash, it leaves me paralyzed the rest of the game without any means to make any money and get back on my feet.  Which makes for a very painful gaming experience.

Maybe that could somehow be avoided, I don't know, and it has only happened a couple times, so it's not the end of the world.  But it has left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth.  Overall, a decent game if you don't mind a bland financial theme.

Wow!  Acquire first came out in 1962 and as far as I am concerned it is still kickin' ass and taking names.  I mean seriously, its a completely playable, enjoyable, strategic experience which comes in at under an hour.  On top of all that I'm willing to argue that its design easily competes with some of the best "Euros" to have come out in the past decade.

As a whole are Euro-style games the progeny of Acquire?  Most definitely.  If you can score a copy do so...and play it!  It doesn't even need to be one of the fancy-pants, Hasbro's Avalon Hill plastic goody editions.  Any will do.  You can probably score one of the but ugly versions for a couple bones.

If you like this game I would recommend Union Pacific and the 18xx series of games.  Union Pacific is very much an Acquire variant.  If you love Acquire you'll probably like UP.  If you are seeking something more 18xx games are *much* longer, more depthful, heavier on the rules, and perhaps only tenuously related...but they might scratch some similar stock-game itches.

A classic game of stocks and mergers. Played it couple of times in 2003 and forgot about it, then returned back to it in 2011. It's not a bad game and to some extent a good game, but also a bit luck-heavy with the tiles and all. If the game played in 45 minutes or so, it would be decent, but now I find it a bit long for what it is.

A modern classic. I love the abstract elegance of the old 3M board. Played many, many times with two players, which is not ideal: better (more challenging, less luck) with three or four. Have always used open holdings. After not playing for a long time, a recent three-player game (June '11) with veteran players reconfirmed this game's greatness. [countless plays through the years]

Picked up two copies in shrink at 75% off at B&N. One for trade, one to keep, I suppose, though don't know if I will play it.

Previously traded away an old 3M version I found in town at a used bookstore.

...And now that I've actually played the game, I regret it.

Well, to be fair, the 1970's 3M was a bit warped, and the money and stock was on super-thin paper, so maybe not that particular version.

BUT I do regret not having played this sooner.

It was chaotic in the best way - it reminded me of surfing actually - you try to ride waves of change as companies merge, reform, and merge again, and your ability to mitigate and control this is limited to your own tiles. The game also seems to have plenty of nasty undercutting as players fight over who will control majority and minority shares.

My only complaint was that if you fall behind or hit a patch of bad luck with tile placement (either your own or that of the other players) it's almost impossible to catch back up.

Can't wait to play it again.


--------

edit, 6/13/08: every play of this game gets better. It's fast paced, it requires difficult decisions, it's random enough to keep me guessing and add some dramatic tension of the unknown, and it's never the same. Plays equally well with casual gamers and family (like my old mom and pops) as it does with serious gamers. It gets suggested and requested frequently around here. I STILL prefer Chicago Express, simply because I know, when I win it, it's because of my own strategy and choices, but this is a closing second. Might as well rate it a nine.

I was pleasantly surprised at how difficult it was (on your own) to significantly influence which hotels would get merged.  Definitely requires understanding some subtle interactions.  It can be very easy to have a bunch of shares you plan to sell in an acquired chain, when all of a sudden that's the acquiring chain and you are stuck strapped for cash.

I got this one for Sarah and I to play together one year for our anniversary.  It scales well from 2 all the way to 6.  It shows its age a little - it's awfully easy for one player to get screwed early on and spend the rest of the game watching everyone else duke it out.  But if you're lucky enough to not be that person, it's fun.

RATING: 6
While I can see why this game might be appealing to some, for me, it is lacking in what I want in a game.  If you play it with the shares face up, it is quite bland.  However, if you play it with the shares hidden, it is more of a memory game with calculations.

RATING: 4
There's a decent amount to think about in this game, but I'm not convinced there's enough to justify the length and repetitiveness. The random tile draws didn't make me feel lucky one way or another, but felt like they overly constrained the game. The tile placement aspect is reminiscent of Tigris & Euphrates, which I prefer to this by far, and I can get a stock fix in any number of other faster, more streamlined games (Santiago, Arkadia). I'm willing but not anxious to try it again.

It's okay for what it is. There's a big luck of the draw factor that prevents it from ever being more than a family game. The entire game boils down to the timing of the big mergers near the end of the game, and which player has the right tile to make the merger go his way. Draw the right tile at the right time and you can cruise to a win.

Shares the real-estate investment theme with Monopoly, but (1) it doesn't take forever and (2) there are actual choices. Easy to explain and plays quickly. The main downside is getting stuck money-less, but even then one can often play kingmaker.

I have both a 1966 version and the latest release (June, 2008).  I like the new version for the artwork and larger tiles, but I wish that it had the recessed board and organizing tray of my 1966 copy.

Gameplay is fairly good although we frequently see that players not involved in the first merge have a hard time finishing near the top.  I think there are some ways to mitigate this, but I have not ever taken the time to try them.

I go back and forth on this one. I really appreciate what it was able to accomplish 50 years ago, but it's a hard one to teach to newcomers to the hobby as the constant referencing of the stock prices really turns people off quickly. I also don't really enjoy playing it with sharky gamers. Fast and light is my favorite approach. Haven't tried the special powers variant designed by Sackson himself, but I'm very keen to give it a whirl to see what I think.

Luck of the draw tiles, some strategy involved in purchasing company stock. It became clear that to win, you need to become the major or minor shareholder of the company that is merged and convert the shares to the bigger company

A Classic Avalon Hill game. I'm luck enough to have the plastic tile version that makes for a more impressive play. Easy game play that can be explained quickly. I'm not sure how much of the game is luck and how much is skill. I haven't seen the same player win twice yet, so it might lean towards luck, but in all likelyhoos is a combination of both.

There's a bit of randomness involved in what tiles you get, but my play has not yet reached the level where I feel my losses (I seem to either win or lose in a huge way) are due to getting screwed on the tile draw.  Not sure how well the game scales--it's easy to keep track of who owns what in a three-player game, and if one player is unable to get cash out early they're hosed.  On the other hand, with five there's quite a bit less control of which corp gets merged into what.

RATING: 7.5
Acquire is a good economic stock holding game. Very much an abstract tile drawing game crossed with an economic engine with a stock market theme. I like the game but as I have only played a few times recently (outside of a solo learning game), I am still not able to fully pass judgment on it. It's easy enough to learn and play and there are enough small variances and tweaks you can employ in the rule set that you can make the game balanced for all (1st through 4th place majority/minority payouts, special 2 player rules etc.) yet I still need to play the game more to be certain that the luck of the draw factor will not make this game more luck filled than I like. It's always a bit disconcerting and unsatisfying when those you play with somewhat complain about a game because they feel it has too much luck in it. I don't mind luck in my games but this might be slightly over the line for a game masquerading as a strategic economic style game. Right now I'm rating this as a tentative 6.5. That could go up .. maybe even by a full 2 points or so once we settle in and explore the nuances of this game to see if luck can truly be overcome and the strategy of this game can be fully fleshed out. Experienced players likely already know the answer to this but the process of discovery in finding this out for ourselves is what makes boardgaming great and I do look forward to more sessions of Acquire.Update.. played a bit more and have upped my rating a full point to 7.5 based on some great game play and further discovery of some of the strategic/tactical nuances of the game. The rating may still go up after more sessions as I'd still like to play the game with the full range of 2-6 players to see if there is a "sweet spot" with a certain number of players. So far 3 players is definitely a little better than 2. Since we are still in the early stages of "exploring" the strategies in this game... I'm still cautious to rate it higher than 7.5 but I do think it does have room to climb further.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Acquire is a race to get as much paper money as possible by the end. Lucks plays a factor in the tile draw, but playing right tiles at the right moment keeps it from being all luck, I would advise groups to decide on open or closed info for money/stocks before playing. Woe betide the player who thinks it is buy low sell high. There is no way to just sell at will. It is a game of creating favourable mergers with a variety of players at the table to stop them catching up with you individually. Game is very simple yet deep enough to take seriously.

It's a delight to play this very first "euro game". All the characteristics are there in a very simple and streamlined form: choose which tiles to place where to maximize your score and minimize that of your opponents, compete by acquiring just about more than your opponents, and balance between money for now or victory points for later. The only objection I have is the run-away leader problem if you get low on cash from the start (which happened to me, but the game was still fun). Why didn't I know about this game back in my Monopoly days?

Acquire is a good game that I'm happy to have in my collection.  I find that it is a great gateway game, especially for people who are interested in business or finance.  It is a tactically interesting game, with some tough decision making.  However, it does seem that sometimes the luck of drawing the tiles can be overpowering.  A good player will usually win, but not as often as in other games.  My other complaint is that in some situations, a player can be completely eliminated from the game early if they spend all their money and don't get a merger soon aftewards, whereas another player may luck into an almost undefeatable position.  A good game, but not without its flaws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.83
Drawing tiles a little too random for me. Most games it probably evens out, and I respect this way ahead of its time design, but some games you just don't draw great tiles that give you enough control over the outcome of the game. The game can drag when that happens. If you're in the thick of the action, though, it's very fun.

Awesome game - trying to predict which corporations are going to grow and merge, and squirming as the wrong ones do, because your opponents all have STUPID tiles, is endless fun. The only problem with this one is that the theme does not appeal to many people and it is perhaps a bit long and repetitive for some - I think it works better as a 3-4 player game, as it can get tedious waiting for your turn with more than that.

Classic Sid Sackson game of buying stock in hotel chains, but if the hotels are not big enough, could be taken over by other hotel chains, changing the stock values. Tense decisions on what stock to buy, and not knowing if you have the majority in the stock. A little bit of luck at the beginning to see if you can form hotel chains to get your founder's bonus.

Me encuentro muy satisfecho con este juego...facil de explicar, facil de entender, pero complicado de ganar, porque todos entran facil a un mood de compra-venta de acciones para hacerse con los derechos de los hoteles (esa es la idea) y hace que sea muy reñido, una misma estrategia no te servira dos veces, debido a que el azar si completa esta vision...no determina, pero si es relevante como para mencionarla.

Love Acquire.  Luck of the tile draw is apparent, but I have played many games where the outcome was always different from initial planning and conclusion.  The more players the better in my opinion.  

Game never gets old in my family.  Acquire gets the most game time.

We even have records:

I have the longest winning streak of 5

My brother-in-law has the highest accumulated dollar amount of $56,200
^Update: I snagged the new highest score of $58,500.
^Update: Brother-in-law has it at $58,800 now.

My sister has the lowest accumulated dollar amount of $13,000.  Update 04/27/2013, I 'acquired' the new all time low of $11,000. Gah!

#Note:  I believe the game is compromised on Acquire.net or any online site where the stocks are visible to all opponents. I wont play the game with that knowledge of stock ownership.

Session 09/04/09- Most amazing game I ever played for myself to win.  All won on a merge of a 3-tile Luxor when I had minority (1 share) to obtain money ($1500).  So I could purchase and hold onto majority shares in my 41+ Continental to win the game by $600.  I was broke most of the end game until the mentioned scenario.

04/23/10-  First time ever to see a tie for a win in a 5 player game.  Me and my brother in-law both hit a score of $41,300

A very basic hotel chain merger & acquisition stock game. Simple rules. Has become an enduring classic, however, it is too simplistic for me. 

Acquire would have more replay value with a more complex variant. In present form, it's more of a family game.

After one play, it was obvious why this game is a classic.  This one really intrigues me!  I own a 3M edition from 1968, and I'm happy with it.  The new Hasbro/AH edition looks pretty, but the box is too big, and the components are delicate, and it's expensive.  The 3M one may be ugly, but it's also cheap, sturdy, compact and functional -- much better overall, imo. 

Rating upgraded from 9 to 10.  With repeated plays, I'm just loving this more and more, and I can't see that ever changing!  Despite the drab components and the unappealing theme, this is one of the very best games in my collection.

Note: My group always plays this with closed holdings.

Initial game plays of Acquire left me impressed. When I found out that Acquire was released in the 1960's I appreciated the game for its revolutionary game play during its time. This charm faded after a couple more game plays. I felt like the game was very unforgiving, to the point where a player can be losing and their is nothing they can do about it but are forced to play for another half hour to an hour. If a player dose not know how to play Acquire "right" it seems, they are at a great disadvantage. This left a bad taste in my mouth, maybe if I played a few more times this opinion might change, but as of now this game is just ehh for me.

I have the old Avalon Hill Version, and prefer it for it's classic nostalgic look and feel.  I also like that game producers had to change the hotel names, as the Luxor, and others were built after the original release of the game.

I like this game as a step toward strategic gaming for those who haven't played a lot of games.  People seem to relate to the buying and selling of hotels, and the visual board keeps people interested.  We play that stock and money are public, which increases player interaction.

A great, classic game.

Prospecting is very similar, and I like both for different reasons.

"The ugliest game that you'll ever love."  This is how I always begin my description of this game (I have the 70's version).

RATING: 6
Acquire is an abstract strategy financial game from the 60's that still holds up today. Unlike Risk or Monopoly, there is no dice-rolling or player elimination. Visually it is not much to look at, so it may take a bit of persuading to get people to play such an old game. Also, at first glance, Acquire looks like it will be math-heavy, but it doesn't involve anything more than simple addition for the end-game total, everything else is just read off a chart. 

I'm glad I got a vintage edition of Acquire. The blinged-out Avalon Hill version from 1999 is pretty cool, but Acquire is still an old-school game that maintains it's old-school feel regardless of how modern the components may be.

Does have one gameplay issue: Inability for players to sell stock except during mergers can potentially lock up players' finances forcing them to sit out the rest of the game. A rare occurrence, but when it happens it sucks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Acquire is a game about stocks, hotels, and mergers.  A money game to the core, but fun and different from any game I have played thus far.  I can see the end of the game being a bit of a downer to someone who was not able to keep a stockpile of cash on-hand.  In the end, because there are not any more spaces left on the board for hotels to grow, many mergers and stock changes happen at the end of the game that players need to be aware of.

I would play this again, however I found the theme dry which does not appeal to, or excite me.

It's a classic for a good reason.  It's far from perfect -- a little too easy to gain that monopoly, a little too random with tile placement -- but with the right group it's a great time.  I think I like it better with fewer players, for the same reason I prefer Caylus with less than 5.

2017 UPDATE: It's a hard game to get to the table if you aren't already a fan, which is a shame because everyone should play this game.  Still charming.

1960s Wooden tile edition:

[ImageID=1730514 small inline]

1999 Hasbro edition:

[ImageID=2582655 small inline]

Acquire was published in 1963 by 3M as part of its Bookshelf Games series. It has been popular among gamers and republished every since. Because of its age, simple components, and financial theme, many people pass over Acquire to play other games with more impressive playing pieces or colorful themes. As far as game design can be a science and an art, Acquire is a masterpiece. 

Each player starts with an amount of currency, and a random set of numbered tiles that only they can see. A player must place one of their numbered tiles on the corresponding empty space on the board grid comprised of lettered rows and numbered columns. If the player creates a contiguous set of three or more tiles on the board, a new company may be founded. If the player connects existing companies, a merger occurs, and the larger company acquires and dissolves the smaller company, with shares and cash payouts. One exception is that large companies above a specified number of tiles, cannot merge. As a final action, the player may purchase stock in any existing company on the board. 

[color=#3388cc][b]Why is Acquire such a good game?[/b][/color]

The brilliance of the game design is that early game play may favor tactical founding and merging small companies. The quantity and value of the different company stocks allows for wealth to spread amongst the players during this growth period.  But later game play requires the player to think strategically about investing in existing companies and being watchful of the growth of all companies and all players investments in the different companies and their values. Every single player's tile placement on each turn, can change company value and player investments. A player may choose to try to enrich themselves, but every other player can join and compete for majority. Players trying to maintain an even spread of shares will lose to the shrewder player who has the most shares of the most valuable companies.

A great article on the history of Acquire can be found here: https://opinionatedgamers.com/2014/05/29/how-acquire-became-acquire/

[color=#3388cc][b]Variations?[/b][/color]

We almost always play with the Special Powers variations, which arguably speeds the game up by about two turns when players activate single-use special powers to A) draw extra tiles or B) purchase more stock or C) play multiple tiles to the board, etc.

[color=#3388cc][b]Pimp it?[/b][/color]

You can get an opaque bag to hold tiles for selection, which allows you to avoid having to turn over all of the tiles on the table top. Originally, I had the 1963 plastic edition and have acquired a 1962 wooden edition, which I enjoy much better. I am considering the 1999 edition for the plastic hotels. There are many different hotel customizations people have made. Additionally, newer versions use corporations instead of hotels, and have corresponding customized stock certificates and/or currency.

Its impeccably crafted mechanism makes Acquire smooth as silk - good timing and control of the board areas are equally needed, the amount and price of the stock options are perfectly weighed for having a wide range of choices throughout the game, the strategy and tactics can change very much from one game to the next, and the draw of the tiles avoids predictability while not seriously influencing the outcome of the game. The topic might put off a bit (finance... what can you say), but a round of play is enough to be left craving for more.

After more than forty years it's still fresh as a daisy - current games might be more spectacular in concept and execution, but when it comes to elegance, depth and fluent gameplay there are only few matches for this. There's just nothing (rules or material) too much or out of place.

I have to confess by being a little underwhelmed by this tactical classic. It's really only area-control in disguise, and the back-and-forth counting of share acquisition is nowhere near as engaging as - say - the placements in El Grande. The basic strategies are easily grasped, although it has to be said that the diplomacy and bluffing elements are immaculately preserved.

But fun? The jury's out.

This game is an excellent example of how a game might be considered "elegant."  There are very few rules, yet within the context of those rules a complex game arises.  This is the best "moneymaking" game I've ever played, and I seriously doubt I'll ever play Monopoly again thanks to this title.

Brilliant game. Elegance, strategy, tactics, table talk, brain burnage, and a short play time. This plays better with 4-5 than it does with other counts, but it's always fun.

This game is the shining example of how to make a game with big moments and an opportunity to fail. Too many modern games artificially keep things close. Acquire does just enough obscuring of the game state to make you usually not lose hope, while still allowing players to fail and fail spectacularly. Victory means so much more to me when a few big decisions I made would have cast be down far below where I finished.

I wish I could rate this an 11. We just started using the house rule that you must state what your company manufacturers when founding one. Hilarious.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10 -> 10)[/COLOR]

[i]I honestly don't have much more to say, every time I've played Acquire it has been a nail biter. It is a truly outstanding design, there is so much depth and nuance packed into such a simple/elegant design. No matter how many games you've played and how jaded you may be you should try Acquire if you get the chance. Acquire is one of the few games I've played that truly stands out and will indefinitely stand the test of time.

My only gripe is how awful the new FF reprint looks and they also changed the dimensions of the board, why?![/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

Excellent intro into stock market games. The perfect example of a game design that has a dead simple rule set, but a lot of strategic depth. There is also a lot of player interaction with the constant shifting of the board state. You need to pay attention to everyone at the table if you intend to do well. Can't wait to play this one more.

心得:
遊戲策略就是前期買小公司，能開公司就開公司
盡量在最有機會被併的小公司持股為最多或第二(分紅的金錢夠你繼續買股)
併購後股票看狀況轉股或繼續持有(沒缺錢不要賣)
遊戲中期如果有發現哪家公司有機會獨大
一定要快速想辦法成為該公司最大股東
靠買股或是小公司被併的轉股
股票張數有限，能夠成為第一就不用再買
規則:
*起始一人六千，每個人抽一個版塊放到版圖上，越靠近A1的就是起始，每個人在按抽六塊當初起始版塊
*股票跟金錢可以決定公開與否，但是剩下的股票一定是公開的
*放版塊 -> 買現有公司的股票(最多三張) -> 抽新版塊
*玩家可宣告遊戲結束一旦有一公司達到41塊規模，或是場上所有公司都11張以上，也可不宣告，最後每家公司會分紅利，且股票全變線，最多錢贏
*兩塊以上還未成立公司的版塊可成立一家公司，從還未成立的公司版塊挑，並擁有一張該公司股票(只要該公司還有股票)
*連結兩張公司的版塊，會讓公司合併(平手有放的人決定誰併誰，11塊以上的公司不能被合併，該版塊不能放)，被併購公司會拿到紅利(第一跟第二，兩個第一就把第一第二獎勵相加平分，兩個第二就把第二獎勵平分)紅利看被合併公司的規模，被併公司股票可此時選擇A保留B照併前價格賣出C兩張換一張併購的公司股票
*不能出的版塊可在回合結束時抽版前，棄掉一起重抽到六張
*兩人遊戲時，只要分紅利時就抽一塊版塊看上面的數字，當作第三位玩家的該公司持股數，然後再按擁有股票數分配紅利，最後記分也會

This is the 1999 Avalon Hill edition with plastic tiles. I've not played this one much so everything is in very good condition and 100% complete.

The strategy seems to be mainly about chosing the best time to merge two companies, and picking investments that will give the best returns, using the information on your tile rack (the tiles that can create mergers or allow others to create mergers are the ones you want to be careful about).

Ahh, Acquire, why do I hate thee so. Because your destiny is entwined in being able to:
a) create companies and get the lead on other buyers in that stock (for majority bonuses) and 
b) being on the subsumed side of as many early mergers as possible to get cash to buy yet more shares.

Get less of these tiles than the other players and you sit there getting bored watching others reap while the sun shines. For a 90 minute game, I expect more than the opportunity to fall behind right from the start and watch the rich get richer.

Very addicting!!  I wish I discovered this years ago!!  This game is much more fun than monopoly, which always seems to rely more on dice than brains.  Years ahead of its time, methinks.  Could seem boring to many folks, and you must keep track of the going rates of the corporations.  But so many awesome people have produced downloadable helps like scoresheets, and information cards to use with tokens for visual aids.  I dare you to try this game.

I actually want to own 2 copies of this:
- the 1995 version with the special powers variant
- a version with plastic or wood tiles. (I hope someday a version with skyscraper pieces).

Never the same game twice. You really need to keep track of what others are doing and whatever you do, don't run out of cash! You can play with open or closed hands, both work well. With open hands there is less memory and you can see exactly what the outcome of a merger will be, while with closed hands, you have to try and figure out or remember if you have majority, which you definitely want during a merger. If you get left out of early mergers it can be painful so there is some luck here.

Love this game. It would be vastly improved with some nice wood components. I've toyed with the idea of making my own set some night.

If you play with a smart crowd they will hold onto the tiles that give others a power play until the end of the the game. As such the endgame can become somewhat uneventful especially with higher player counts as it becomes obvious who is still in the running and who isn't.

Nonetheless, lots of tension and strategy, especially early and midgame.

3 players: Not ideal in my opinion. There are much better.
4-5 players: Awesome but probably best at 5 as there are better 4 player games.
6 players: Haven't done it much at this count but it seems a bit much for downtime and I feel like you don't have much control anymore.

One of the first Euro-style games ever made, and still very good.  The careful balance you have to make between buying stock and intentionally ditching your stocks to get money again is difficult, and too-often leads to players with no actual options in the mid-game, so I've dinged it a few points for that... but it's still fantastic, and I enjoy every game of it that I play, even if I do terrible.

Innovative and influential game by Sid Sackson. I was given this by my girlfriend, who used to play it with her brother and cousins in the 80s.  

It does suffer from two flaws: the game is unforgiving to poor strategy and/or poor luck of the draw.  I don't mind luck in games, but unfortunately this game has a true [b]run-away leader[/b] mechanic (positive feedback). It rewards the leaders with increased investment opportunities and punishes the laggards with few to no opportunities.  The feedback insures that if you are somewhat behind by mid game, you will almost certainly be MUCH farther behind at the end.

The other flaw is esthetic: [b]exponential inflation[/b] is built into the monetary system.  At the beginning you are counting out hundred dollar bills.  By the end you are counting out five thousand dollar bills.  It makes the game feel loose.

Widely regarded as one of the first board games with Eurogame sensibilities, Acquire is probably the father of all modern stock-holding games.  Players have a hand of tiles with coordinates describing where they can be placed on the grid board, and each turn they must place one.  Groups of adjacent tiles are considered to be hotel chains, and players can buy (but not sell) stock in those chains.  Tile placements can grow existing chains, create new chains, or merge chains--in this case, players owning the smaller chain can either trade in for stock of the bigger chain, or cash out.  Because cashing out is the one way to get money in the game, players generally want to be acquired so that they have a cash flow, though owning the monster chains can be very valuable at the end.  While I'm not the biggest fan of stock games, I certainly can appreciate this classic title.

RATING: 8
One of the games I have played the most (over 100 times if you include online play). Really good, although I've played it so much that a few problems are worth pointing out. One, it's difficult for new players not get destroyed without coaching. They will invariably make bad buys, fail to capture a majority or do so in isolated companies and run out of money and be forced to sit with a lost position with nothing to do. Two, it's pretty dry (despite the new snazzy looking pieces and designs). Three, requires heavy concentration (and card counting) if you wish to do well, yet doesn't always reward this as with more players the random element negates the benefits of planning to a degree. Four, can take up a good chunk of your evening to play, and you can be stuck for a lot of that time without a chance of winning. Five, ending can be anti-climatic (recommend you convert all your funds to $5k notes, and do a simultaneous countdown until the winner appears). These issues have come up over 25 years of playing. But we should all respect this strong Sackson title: it's been around in various forms for a LOOONNG time for a reason.

12/11/05: with some many other good Euros out there, I don't think this will come out too much in the future. Played it 20-30 times online recently, perhaps every couple of years I will get the bug, but there are other games I'd rather introduce and invest time in (PR, PoF, E

Definitely one I need to play again. The board was impossible to read and the game was a bit dense initially strategy-wise. I bought too many shares of companies that didn't merge right away and I sat for almost half the game only placing a tile as I had barely any money or no money at all. Not the games fault, it was my dumb ass, but it made it less enjoyable than it could have been.

Still, the game was quite aesthetically pleasing even with the horrendously hard to read board.

I like laying tiles.  It's a good economic game and I like how you can decide when to force a merger.  It plays faster than other economic games.

I don't rate it higher as it's too dry for my tastes--buy stock, hopefully have the right tiles to grow your company or force the merger, make money on the merger.

Simpler, faster and better strategy than Monopoly. Love the merger mechanic and trying to figure out which chains to buy stock in.

I like to use a variant where you just draw the next tile out of a bag and play it. It makes the game go faster. I feel the better part of the strategy is figuring out which stocks to buy and not which tile to place next anyway.

You still have to do the money changing and mental math as in Monopoly, and calculating the final tally at the end game is a bit tedious, but the thrill of the merger is way more fun than waiting for somebody to land on your property with a house.

Can have that classic old school "you aren't playing the game for a bit" feel to it.

It can have a rough runaway leader problem.

yet despite all that it is a wonderful game, truly makes you feel like an inside trader with very minimalist design.

RATING: 6
Fairly simple strategy game where you are buying stocks for hotels that are being founded, growing and merging. I can definitely see my non-gaming family playing this -- it's very easy to explain and understand.

Not great with two, but I imagine it is a better game for more.

Whenever this one is chosen I always have to brace myself for the memory and brainpower needed to compete.  And then I do so and I always have a great time.  Played this a bunch with the Madison Board Gamers in the mid-aughts, and they'll put you through the wringer quick if you don't meet their intensity.

One knock on it: though it's usually the case that skill leads to victory, the odd blowout or period of stagnation can occur due to unlucky tile draws.

Wow, someone making Eurogames way back when!  I guess that was Sackson's genius, and I'm glad these kinds of designs became the Eurogame inspiration they deserved to be.  Great example of how relatively minor rule components (2nd-place player benefits) can absolutely drive a design.

This is a board game classic. The design is actually quite old, but it's still good (and doesn't show its age). This is a great gateway economic game about stock buying, building up companies, and selling them out in mergers for a quick profit. The board play is quite abstract and scrabble-esuqe, but still quite good for what it is.

RATING: 7
Fairly abstract but fun. Build one or more chains of hotels. The more they grow, the more the stock is worth. But to buy stock you have to have money, which you will get when your chain is merged into a larger one. So to win you will have to start new chains and hope to have them bought out.

Can get really tricky toward the end, when few tiles are left and you're hoping to draw that perfect tile while fearing that one of you opponents are holding on to it just to block you.

My rating of this game has really improved with more plays. It is a simple yet strategic game, if a little abstract. It saddens me that this is still the best share game I've played.

I don't think the game should have three share classes (or they should be treated as an "expansion"). I also got the rules wrong the first couple of times I played it. 

It's a classic, everyone should try it. If you ever see the 1999 version for less than $60 you'd be a fool not to acquire it

Long considered a classic, yet I only read about it when I subscribed to Sumo in the late '90s. I bought the 1995 cardboard version with special power tiles, but it took some enthusiasm to finally play it (I thought the simple rules would make it a boring game). Myself and a few family members enjoyed the quick thinking person's "Monopoly".

Recently played again (with the plastic 2005 edition) and it shows its age compared with the Euros I've been fed for the past 5-6 years. It's interesting in trying to anticipate the mergers with some clues possibly coming from the other player's stock purchases. Unfortunately as a package it is an unforgiving design in regards to tiles drawn (I think I can say the last game with one quick corporation and merger help alot in my victory) and if cash strapped it can mean you are out, which is bad to sit through for 60 mins. Even the special powers don't seem to help. Also the cross refencing and working out the maths for share prices etc is abit of a hiccup in the proceedings and puts some players off. 

Sadly the grandfather of Euro's, it's time to retire. The merger system and share holdings has been superceded by Stephenson's Rocket (and Rheinlander).

update
Az utóbbi két játékot korántsem élveztem annyira, mint az első kettőt, egy kicsit unalmasnak találtam, talán, mert nem hárman, hanem négyen játszottunk. Így 9-ről visszaugrott a pont 7.5-re

Interesting game, it will reward the player with a good memory. The newer Avalon Hill version has very nice bits. The concept is simple and easy to teach. I enjoyed our first game.
Update May 2013: This was good in its time. However the tile draw has too mcuh of an effect on the eventual winner to be seroiusly considered strategic in my opinion. Buy first or second place in shares and rinse and repeat. Oh, and if you can remember who bought what better then the others it might help you win. While its good for memory improvement it seroiusly lacks in teh fun factor for me.

A true classic. A bit counter-intuitive in that you make money for being bought rather than investing in a winner. The tile laying mechanism is great.

There has been quite a lot of attention of late to the notion of secret versus public stock holdings. I played recently with secret holdings and it didn't feel different (but I don't spend much time worrying about other folks holdings during my turn and I could recall others holdings for the few companies I was focused on). Perhaps it played a bit faster.

RATING: 9
A great game with lots of choices. You must grow your properties, but too quickly you price your self out of the market. Mergers make you money but might help your opponents net worth more than you. However, mergers are necessary to get money to continue buying stock. If you get locked out your growth will stall, you may need to force a merger to keep buying stock. If you are too heavy in one company you will not get help growing it, so you would want to diversify, remember you don't always have to be first second can work as well. I find the number of options available fascinating.

Sure, there is a good chunk of luck to manage, and sure some players can get screwed, but for the most part the person who does the best to diversify and participate in mergers will win. Still find it surprising how unique this game continues to feel too with few modern titles utilizing similar mechanics or concepts.

My dad and his friends play this regulary and I have been playing it with them for quiet some time. It is a very abstract game and I am very much a fan of heavily themed games. The game mechanics are simple but work well. The fact that other people see what "stocks" you buy is the crux of the game, because it is around the stock buying the bluffing and speculation evolves. Think Scrabble with waging. I do prefer the older editions over the new ones. My Dad has the 3M Bookshelf edition and the packaging is fantastic.

RATING: 5
This is one of the few games in which the mechanics themselves are evocative of the theme, which is surprising since the mechanics are so simple.

Despite the simplicity of the ruleset, there are things in the game that I consider as flaws:

* There are turns during which you have no meaningful decisions to make since you both might have useless tiles in your hand or there aren't any worthwhile shares to purchase (or can afford to purchase). I prefer games in which *every* turn you must make some meaningful choice.

* Significant money flow only comes from majority share holder bonuses. If you don't get any of these bonuses during the game, then you're pretty much screwed.

* Near the end of the game, players are counting the size of the larger hotel chains so they can calculate when the game's going to end. Counting about 30-40 individual tiles is annoying. This could be rectified by someone writing these values down, but no one bothers to do that, of course.

I own the all-plastic minimalistic and austere 3M version, which reflects the 1950s-1960s ethos better than the newest incarnation of the game (which I think has excellent artwork despite its flimsy components).

=====

Note that I don’t like area majority or influence games. I own two copies of this but I don’t particularly like this game; the pacing is just way too slow. I can’t stand having to look all over the board to see where my tiles could be played, nor do I like having to “wait” for a tile to appear in my rack. Perhaps this game just doesn’t work as well with three players (the most I ever played this game).

Great mechanics, but not sure if it's really my type of game.

That's what I first thought, but now that I have played a couple more times I am really enjoying it. Wouldn't mind getting my hands on a copy someday, but I have access to one to play.

This is becoming a regular with my game group, and now that I've played it more I can really get into it now. Just raised my rating of it from a 7 to an 8.

I haven't played this in a while and was a little rusty. Lost by only $700. It still hasn't lost its charm. This is a game that will continue to last for many decades (I hope it gets reprinted).

acquire feels surprisingly fresh given how old the game is. my only real complaint is that this game seems to have the same problem that settlers of catan has, in that some players will be out of contention during the mid-game and will have to sit and play for 20-30 more minutes with no hope of winning. that's kinda sucky. despite this problem, acquire is way more engaging than settlers.

also, the monetary transactions are kind of fiddly. playing with chips instead of paper money would probably alieviate the tedium of buying and selling stocks during the game, and improve the pace of the payouts at the end. pretty neat and fun game though.

After reading so many good things about this game, I was a little underwhelmed after playing this. I somehow expected more from this game and it feels a bit fiddly to track all the other player information about stock size. It is a good game, but I think that Shark is much more fluent in game play...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty good game but it is not easy to control your destiny particularly if the player to your left keeps going after what you need to get. It could probably use a variant to make it more balanced. Perhaps it would become more balanced if you had your share of tiles from the very beginning and/or everything was done via simultaneous action selection. 

Regardless, decent game just not a great one.

Game plays well enough and is still solid, especially given its age. The random drawing of tiles is typical for games from this time so it's understandable that it is here as well. It is often hard to plan for what to do as you do not know what tiles you will have to choose from. It is not uncommon for a player to get the perfect tile(s) and grow and merge as they seem fit while you need to buy and sell stocks to stay ahead of the market and not get caught selling low. A little too much luck involved in my opinion. The game is enjoyable, but there are others in this genre and that are similar that are more likely to make it to the table.

RATING: 6
I have played this several times and I'm torn as to whether or not this is a good game.

This game offers a lot of opportunity for strategy.  Timing your moves is very important as is keeping track of what everybody else is doing.  It has that pure strategy trait where you have to predict what others are planning and plan your own moves accordingly.  It really becomes a match of wits.

Unfortunately, I find the tile-drawing mechanic destroys the strategy.  Just as a game of poker can be won by a lucky card in the river, so too can a game of Acquire be won or lost based on the turn of the tiles.  There is little you can do if you end up not getting critical tiles, while those who do get critical tiles can become very powerful as a result.

It's also easy to get yourself stuck early on and kill your entire game.  If you find yourself with no cash in hand and all of your investments become "safe" (or just aren't nearing being acquired), your turns will just be passes until something finally gets acquired.  In the mean time, you will be earning nothing while others pull far away from you.  It's easy to fall into this trap and it ruins the rest of the game for any player that finds themselves there. It's really boring to play when you can't play anything.

The play can also be quite slow.  Examining players' stocks and those still available, finding spaces on the board, counting the size of hotel chains and trying to calculate the worth of stocks all make for a time-consuming process.  Every decision is agonizing and can mean the difference between winning and losing.

And when it finally ends, the winner often isn't who you think it is.  It's difficult to judge who is winning just by looking at the piles of stocks and the sizes of hotel chains.  It makes it difficult to judge the state of the game and plan accordingly.  I've also found myself making Excel spreadsheets to help with tallying the final score because there are so many numbers involved.  It takes 5-10 minutes just to find out who won, at which point, people are already thinking about what game to play next.

With so many bad things to say about it, you would think I would rate it low, and yet it still offers a chin-stroking challenge and lots of opportunity for strategy.  Like a game of poker, you find yourself benefiting from these flaws just as often as you fall victim to them and I find myself driven to find a way to "beat" the game.

It's something different and it is certainly challenging.  Victory is sweet and it can feel great when everything goes your way.  As far as a fun, balanced, fulfilling game; I think there are better games to be had.  I don't recommend this game, but that doesn't stop me from playing it.  I only wish it could be tweaked to make it better. It suffers from many of the same problems as Monopoly.

Looks like some "classics" really deserve their label.  I love economic/stock market style games, and Acquire has very elegant gameplay considering its age.  I own the "vintage" version, which couldn't look more basic, but that doesn't stop me from recommending it at the regular game sessions.

RATING: 7
A reliable game.  Appeals to non-gamers as its simple sequence of play feels familiar.  However, first-timers invariably run out of money part-way through the game and miss out on a lot of the action.  This is really a strike against the game.  Even experienced players can, by chance, miss out on being in the first two mergers, and then end up side-lined for the rest of the game.  Don't play with 6.  I have the AH version with the bonus actions: they are actually quite good, and spice it up a bit without ruining it.  There are a few fiddly rules to prevent tiles locking up, but it is very simple and usually offers some thought and tension.

This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher. Each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock. As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizeable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.

I have the 1968 version which looks to play quite nicely.

Great stock manipulation game and one of my all time favorites.  I like the decisions regarding where to form companies what to do with stock on a merger, etc.  Do I save this tile for a possible merger?  Play it now?  Fun stuff and easy to grasp.  Personally, I love the Hasbro over-production.

Played with open holdings for the first time and I'm now not sure which way I prefer - open or closed.

I spent years disliking this game, which was popular in the local group as a 'fill in' game while waiting for something else to finish and more people to be available for a round of something else.

Another one of my recent top-100 tries that I would like to get a few more games of. Game play initially appears quite random, you draw tiles and place then on designated spots on a board. These start, expand, or merge hotel chains. At the same time you buy shares in the chains. Shares appreciate in value as chains get bigger but they also pay out bonuses if you have the majority holding in a company.

In fact it becomes clear that tile placement is a lot less random than it initially looks (you just can't see the patterns for your first couple of moves) though decisions on when to buy, trade, or exchange shares are a vital part of the game.

Definitely an interesting and challenging game, and potentially easy and fast enough to be playable with the family.

(6/17/08) - Pozy.com strikes again. This is the 2008 reprint with the supposedly not-so-fabulous components. I had been looking to acquire a copy of Acquire (poor joke) for awhile now. A $20 price tag is fine by me as a way to get my foot in the door.

(3/22/09) - [8.5] - After playing a pair of 3-player sessions with Merph and Tim this weekend I find myself a huge fan of this game. I love the shameful manipulation of stocks a player must conduct in order to win. If you have the tile to merge a corporation, why not wait and buy a ton of the acquired corporation first in order to win a shareholder bonus? It's no wonder this game has stood the test of time.

(09/21/2014) - [5.5] - Unfortunately I find myself revising my Acquire rating by a three-point reduction. I think my group is much better at this game than I am. Getting wrecked every time has taken a lot of the fun away! With a group of fresh meat this is probably an 8.5 rating again.

SOLD (04/14/2017) - Acquire has been sold. I found it to be very enjoyable for a number of plays, but was ready to part with it.

RATING: 6.1
(+) Quickly explained
(+) Nice playing time
(+) Fun stock-market take-over mechanisms. Overall original gameplay

(-) Impossible to sell shares: why?
(-) Too much luck-dependance with tile-draws. This makes an interesting stock-market game feel like a geeky decorated version of bingo
(-) First take-overs appear to be crucial. Miss the first few and the lucky rich-ones will get more powerful and the others will have to endure the rest of the game poor and without any chance of victory. This is a very punishing gaming mechanism which revolves around luck concerning the tile draws. Major disappointment!

RATING: 8
Put Acquire on this side of the scale, Spades in the other.  The balance is about perfect!  The simplicity of rules, the uncomfortable tension of not knowing what your opponents will do, the card-counting and lapses of memorization,  the cursing/blessing of luck, the joy of realizing that you will reach your goal.  

So imagine Spades as a graphical novel, where the following story unfolds before your eyes: the Many Hands of Gods try to stir up a primordial soup, making bets with each other and maneuvering their favorite-tasting proto-organisms into the hungry mouths of other proto-organisms.  The organisms in the protoworld grow and evolve, and what starts out as a fairly egalitarian society later contains a few dinosaurs that can menace others, though considerable tension occurs when equally-matched dinosaurs come into contact.  In addition, the Gods go through a maturing process over the course of a game: the young, immature Gods worry over short-term gains, like hungry dogs; by midgame, they are more maturely wondering about the longer-term future, and their behaviour changes as such.  Can you imagine all of this in a game with a ruleset and mental requirement no greater than Spades?

I find the Chuckles Variant the best:  closed holdings, but any time during your turn, you may ask one of your opponents how much stock they own of a particular company.  Only one question can be asked per turn.

Certainly not a bad game, but I think Tigris & Euphrates covers the part of this that I enjoy the most: the growing, merging chains (empires).

not sure bout this one - feels luck based with the tiles - and who gets in early mergers gets cash to invest while others just watch

also flow feels wierd and undynamic - later we all had money but nothing to invest in cos all shares sold

maybe it was an odd game but im not convinced

2nd game same as 1st - luck decides and going last sux..also production of latest version is cheap and unappealing

RATING: 7.4
Classic stock and mergers game. I generally prefer playing with stock revealed since I'm not a fan of memory mechanics in games. If you get some good draws early in the game, you can create a gap from the other players that is hard to make up. The tile placing is a little restrictive, even with a large hand of tiles. It's easy to sit on a tile someone else desperately needs, or continuously draw tiles that don't help you. 

To me, two things really make this game tense and interesting: the majority and minority shareholder bonus. Do you diversify trying to get a minority bonus in several companies, risking not getting a bonus at all, or focus on majorities in one or two companies? With the semi-random development of the board, you have to take gambles on which companies are going to grow, and which to take a pass on.

It is a little too easy for someone to run out of cash, and not able to get more for extended periods of the game. The luck of the draw can basically knock someone out of the game if the company they invested their money in doesn't merge, since that is the only way to get more money. I've seen people locked out of the game for several turns not able to do anything but play tiles to help others. While this can be prevented most of the time, sometimes it is just the luck element of the game biting you.

Sheer luck can win this game. But it's rare. It rewards planning, watching your opponents moves and trying to figure out exactly why they made it. Are they trying to buy into something you own because they think it'll grow, or because they want to merge it into a larger hotel to help gain share. Watch you money, having none is a very bad thing when a prime opportunity comes along.

----------

This isn't a stock market game.  Sure, you have stocks, but there isn't really any market simulation going on:  stock prices don't rise/fall with demand but are instead a bi-product of company size... which is too much of an abstraction on the stock market for the game to fit inside that category.  That being said, I don't care.  I love the competition surrounding the majorities/minorities in the hot prospects and then trying to get your majorities/minorities merged.  But the tension is high and the game offers plenty of decisions for its relatively quick play time.

I actually like the randomness of the tile draw; this allows the game to unfold somewhat differently each time.  Sure, sometimes luck will play a factor in the outcome, but it's not a game-breaker by any means (some of my friends would strongly disagree).  

I really enjoy this one.

This Game is quite fun for being so old. This game is more family oriented and  I can easily get my kids to play this one. You are just buying and selling shares in hotels and hoping for a lucky draw of the tile. This is really fun for what it is... I just prefer games with more thinking and strategy.

Pros: Simple game play entertaining variety and stock speculation mechanic.

Cons: Math calculations throughout

I picked the new edition of aquire up because it was cheap and recommended by my local FLGS as i was buying agricola.

This game is MUCH better than agricola.

The mechanics are absurdly simple.  Play a tile, buy some shares.  The rest of the game is procedural, save for some decisions on what to do with stock after an aquisition.

That said, the game can be tense and laid back at the same time.  Tense as you pay attention to what everyone is buying(knowing who has stock where is a key to victory) and laid back due to the groans and cheers of the inherent randomness.

Must have for any collection.

**I cannot believe what a shameless cash-in the 2008 version of this game was.  Horribly inadeqaute, and it dimishes the game.  I had rated this a 10 bawsed on the above-par 1999 Hasbro edition.  I felt so burned after trading away my older copy and acquiring the "improved" edition in that I can scarcely believe my own stupidity.  BUYER BEWARE**

Very replayable, very engaging.  Elegant.  Complex enough to remain interesting while simple enough to be approachable and not put off newbies.  Waiting for an acquisition if one has depleted their cash can slow their game down for a long time if things don't go their way.  Otherwise, we liked this one very much.

I first came into contact with Acquire many years ago when I bought the 1998 Avalon Hill edition used for a price that is well under what that version of the game sells for now.  I read the rules, determined that it must be the most boring game ever, and sold it right away without playing it.  What a mistake.

This year, as a far more mature gamer, I decided to give Acquire a second chance and bought a used 2008 edition for a few dollars.

I loved it from my first play.

Yes, there is randomness in the tile draws, and you can find yourself out of a game through getting cut out of some big mergers, but few games build tension like this classic.  Never going out of my collection.

I have only played the new Avalon Hill (HasBORG) Edition. This is a tile laying/area influence game. The tiles have a number and a letter that denote where it can be played. Each tile only has on playable space on the board. Sometimes this can be frustrating, as you wait and wait and wait for the tile you need to be played. Although, you should be buying stock and anticipating other mergers to be happening while you wait. When two or more tiles are adjacent, and don't already have a corporation for them, the player who made laid the second tile down can assign this grouping of tiles a corporation, and recieves a free stock in it. There is a limited number of corporations, so starting them early on is a plus. If able, saturating the board with corporations early on, thus recieving a free stock in all you start, opens up alot of options for everybody and really stretches players thin. On the flipside, if there are only 1 or 2 corporations on the board for to long, then all the players are vying for control of those, and its hard to get ahead and becomes repetitive. After a player places a tile, then he has the option of buying stock. Only [b]3[/b] shares of stock. Whether they be from the same, or from different corpoations, 3 is the limit. It is this limit that really taxes the brain. Do you spread thin and hope you can get a piece of action from at least a few of those, or try to be strong in one, and weak in another. There are only 25 shares in each corporation, with the first share going to the player that started it for free. This allows a observational player to gauge who has how much of what, and determine if it's worth it to invest in a corporation, considering how likely it is to be bought out soon, and whether or not he'll make any money out of it, taking into account how useful his tiles are to which corporation's chance to grow or die. It is a good idea to hold the majority in at least 1 corporation during the game, winner usually has majority or, at least, minority in one of the last surviving corporations at the end of the game. When a tile is placed so that it joins 2 or more corpoations, then they merge. The corporation that has more tiles before the merger with incorporate the other, adding its tiles to itself. Everyone who had stock in the bought-out corporation recieves a payout, with the amount depending on the size of the bought-out corporation. With the Max amount going to the majority holder, and half the max amount going to the minority holder. Then the individual shares can be sold for their going rate (which also depends on the size of the bought-out corporation), or traded at a 2-1 ratio for shares in the larger, still active corporation. Trading up is usually a better idea, because shares for that corporation would usually be alot more that the selling cost of the dead corporation, considering the size of the new active corporation. All in all, this is a game that is really easy to teach to newbies, and has a deep strategy to keep veteran players interested. Elegance, with a random keep-you-doubting-and-hoping mechanic at its simplist and best.

接触较早的一款桌游，而其作为桌游也比较...
喜欢这个游戏的人很喜欢，我觉得略一般，但作为1962年的游戏来说还是很不错的。
A game I have met in the early time of my BG life. And it's also a very old game too.
People likes it a lot but think so so. In consider of it's age I think it's a good game.

Indeed a classic, and one that has aged very well. I'm not a huge fan of the theme, but the design is clean and well balanced. (Actually, you could probably say those things about most Sackson games). The 2000-and-something AH / Hasbro all plastic edition is really well done.

I think this is something you could introduce as a family game in lieu of Monopoly and make everyone much happier.

I don't even know WHY I like this game.  There's something about it -- the monopoly-like money, the buying/selling of companies.

Mildly interesting stock/area majority game. A bit dry with the money shuffling and so so theme. Prefer many other games than this to use my 60-90 minutes gaming time. Feels like another abstract with a tacked on theme that fails to inspire me. There's some opportunity for mean plays, which at least makes it interesting at times.

RATING: 9
Players invest their money in stocks.  The value of the different holdings depends of the number of companies that they control in a grilled board.  If holdings touches each other the bigger one absorbs the other, so the value of stocks gets higher, and the price for being the first and second stock holder too.  This is a good game, with some nice decisions and strategies.  Being absorb is as good as absorbing, cause it gives you valuable money that allows you to get some other stocks.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite light, actually, even though the playtime can reach 2 hours. Fair amount of luck (it's much harder if you never draw any tile that can create a new corporation or merge existing ones). But overall, some interesting choices, and nice economy feeling.

I played this a ton as a teenager with my sister head to head and against a computer AI.  It IS a good game, but punishing.  If you make a mistake early on, you've got zero chance - the rest of the game just continues on miserably for you...Ultimately its not a game I want to play any more given there are better stock games out there.

My biggest complaint about this game is the hidden stocks. Knowing who has how many of each company is a significant advantage. But, if I wanted to play a game where I needed to cards, I'd much rather play bridge or other games.

I may like this better if I played with open stocks. But, I see too much luck in who draws the needed merger tiles. And, the mechanism just does not seem that interesting to me.

This game plays much better than it initially sounds.  I tend not to gravitate towards financial games, but Acquire has a nice tension level to it.  I have the newer version which does have a downside.  The orange and yellow and the blue and teal colors are very close and are sometime hard to differentiate.  If you enjoy any sort of game, get Acquire.  You will not be disappointed.

A fun stock game. The entire game is about speculating how companies are going to grow or collapse, and that's fun. Also, any game where you have to manage your money well to have any chance of winning gets some points in my book.

RATING: 6
I can't say I'm usually in the right frame of mind for this classic.  To me, it's a chaos-laden area influence game with a bit of (almost insignifcant) tile play.  No doubt that there are hard decisions to be made about what stock to buy, whether to merge chains, etc.  Yet, I don't find any of them terribly fun - just stressful.  Although I think the game is overrated, I admit there was a time (early 1990s) that it was one of my very favorite games.  Now there are just too many other better games of its length and weight that get my playing time.

The classic from my childhood, played after Christmas dinner every year with the extended family, is still as good as it ever was.  Sid Sackson's finest achievement only seems to get better with time.  Simple choices. Not TOO heavy on the strategy, but far from brainless.  Plotting your moves, trying to count cards and remember who has what stock positions, trying to perfectly time your mergers to extract every last penny from the majority bonuses, only to have you plans foiled by opponents playing their mergers ahead of your schedule.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Acquire mixes a need for both short-term and long-term strategies very well: The winner almost always has a good balance of both. There is a decent amount of luck involved so that new players can certainly be in the hunt if they get the right tiles while experienced players can't completely blame a loss on the tiles they get, though that would be a factor. Most importantly, the game is a lot of fun. It's a great feeling to see your long-term hotel(s) get larger and larger thus making their stock prices rise and maybe even a better feeling to cash in on the bonuses when your smaller short-term hotel(s) gets acquired. Wonderful game.

RATING: 9
A downright addictive game with a good deal of randomness, but not so much that long term strategies are impossible. Deducing the intentions of your opponents is advisable. Some tough decisions sometimes have to be made. The game gets more tactical in the second half, and the decisions get tougher. There is a bit of a press your luck aspect near the end re: keeping shares after a merger and hoping to re-start a company before someone else does and before the game ends.  Best to play it with shares & money hidden. Too much analysis paralysis otherwise. If you are good at keeping track of things in your head, then you deserve the slight advantage it gives you when playing this game.

Wow.  I can't believe it took so long for me to play this.  It is nearly perfect in its simplicity.  You place a tile and buy shares, but by the end of the game, you are scrambling to be the majority shareholder and hoping your company gets bought by another company.  The ONLY thing that keeps this from being a 10 (even on one play) is the fact that it has an illogical bit about not being able to sell stocks unless the company gets merged.  Aside from that (VERY) minor quibble, this game is fantastic and immediately goes into my top 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Have been playing this game since I was about 6.  What a game.  Only thing that keeps this from being higher is that now I really only play 2P, which is nice, but needs tweaking (we play 1 less piece in hand and 1 less chain on board - forces playing pieces you dont want to).  3P i think is where this game shines.  Enough for all, yet not too crazy.  5P results in too much chaos i think.

RATING: 6
This one just doesn't do it for me.  I have not been able to figure out a way to be consistently competitive.  I know there must be some skill involved because the same couple of people always seem to do well.  However, I only seem to do well when I get lucky draws--which isn't very often.  It's just not fun playing a game where I'm not really going to factor except as a spoiler / kingmaker.

Pretty sure every time I have played the winner of the game was on the buy-out side of the first merger.

I played Acquire every week, with few exceptions, from late 1990 through early 2005.  Our group was a total of five players and we typically played two games of Acquire every game night.  My point?  This game has replayability.

Our group found the 1960's versions of the game much more functional than the 1999 Avalon Hill (Hasbro) edition, hence the higher rating for this edition.

For his geeklist titled "[geeklist=34548]Short Interviews With Each Person Who Has The Most Recorded Plays of Each of the Games Ranked 51-100[/geeklist]" James Fehr ([user=fehrmeister]fehrmeister[/user]) asked me a few questions:

[i]What do you like the most about Acquire?[/i]

Hmm. All the features I can think of aren't really specific to Acquire. Random tile-draws provide replayability as well as the potential for both good and bad luck. (Yes, I think luck is a good thing. Responding to players' deliberate moves can foster only so much adaptability.) The shared gameboard means that players' actions impact subsequent gameplay for everyone. Tactics and strategy are rewarding, but not to the extent that newbies can't play successfully with experienced players.

[i]What do you currently rate this game (from 1 to 10)?[/i]

I have an odd dichotomy of thought on that one. I consider it one of the greats (perhaps as high as a 9), but I don't actually want to play it. Let me be clear: I did not burn out. I still enjoy the game and I'll happily play if that's what the group wants. The thing is, we own so many games (many of them unplayed) that it's hard to devote time to a game we've already played so frequently for so many years.

[i]Do you think you'll be playing much more of it in the future?[/i]

In the near future, not much. But I hope that our retirement years will be spent playing and playing and playing our favorites. Acquire is definitely on the list.

[i]Why do you think this game is so replayable? In other words, what keeps you from getting bored with it after so many plays?[/i]

Answering that is like answering why I like to play board games. I can point to various qualities of games, but it really comes back to some ineffable personal affinity. For all the years we played, I found Acquire somehow simultaneously engaging and comfortable. It's important to mention that our gaming group was committed to Acquire Night. It was rare for any of us to miss a session. This meant we didn't have to worry whether there would be enough people, and since this group didn't play any other games, we didn't agonize over which game we would play. Our Acquire Night was spent in companionable gameplay.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

This game is not only a classic; it's a classic that we enjoy.

I played Acquire every week, with few exceptions, from late 1990 through early 2005.  Our group was a total of five players and we typically played two games of Acquire every game night.  My point?  This game has replayability.

Our group found the 1960's versions of the game much more functional than the 1999 Avalon Hill (Hasbro) edition, hence the higher rating for this edition.

For his geeklist titled "Short Interviews With Each Person Who Has The Most Recorded Plays of Each of the Games Ranked 51-100" (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/34548) James Fehr (fehrmeister) asked me a few questions:

[i]What do you like the most about Acquire?[/i]

Hmm. All the features I can think of aren't really specific to Acquire. Random tile-draws provide replayability as well as the potential for both good and bad luck. (Yes, I think luck is a good thing. Responding to players' deliberate moves can foster only so much adaptability.) The shared gameboard means that players' actions impact subsequent gameplay for everyone. Tactics and strategy are rewarding, but not to the extent that newbies can't play successfully with experienced players.

[i]What do you currently rate this game (from 1 to 10)?[/i]

I have an odd dichotomy of thought on that one. I consider it one of the greats (perhaps as high as a 9), but I don't actually want to play it. Let me be clear: I did not burn out. I still enjoy the game and I'll happily play if that's what the group wants. The thing is, we own so many games (many of them unplayed) that it's hard to devote time to a game we've already played so frequently for so many years.

[i]Do you think you'll be playing much more of it in the future?[/i]

In the near future, not much. But I hope that our retirement years will be spent playing and playing and playing our favorites. Acquire is definitely on the list.

[i]Why do you think this game is so replayable? In other words, what keeps you from getting bored with it after so many plays?[/i]

Answering that is like answering why I like to play board games. I can point to various qualities of games, but it really comes back to some ineffable personal affinity. For all the years we played, I found Acquire somehow simultaneously engaging and comfortable. It's important to mention that our gaming group was committed to Acquire Night. It was rare for any of us to miss a session. This meant we didn't have to worry whether there would be enough people, and since this group didn't play any other games, we didn't agonize over which game we would play. Our Acquire Night was spent in companionable gameplay.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

This game is not only a classic; it's a classic that we enjoy.

I have fondness for stock market games and this one pleasantly surprised me, being different, vintage even. Maybe closest one could get to enjoying the ride in stock market games as there's just enough randomness (I love chaos) and interesting speculations roaming above the heads of the players. Didn't feel like incentive partnership type affair, but closer to traditional capitalist feel of being in it for oneself and trying to sniff out what the future will bring and what those other bastards are up to. Merger mechanic is unique (for me) and deciding what to do with outdated stocks is still (an intriguing) mystery to me. 

My problem right now is that the version I've played (AH big ass plastic edition) is oop and ridicolously priced, whereas in print version seems the most inferior of them all. [i]Help! I need somebody. Help! Not just anybody...[/i]

Do not take my rating wrong. This is a good game but I lean towards games with more theme. To be honest any sort of "Business/Economics" type game instantly loses 1 to 2 points in my ratings. This game is definitely a classic and has some fairly solid streamlined rules. There just is not enough meat or "interesting" theme to the mechanics.

RATING: 6.5
Played twice with 4P, with a two-year span between games. The groups I have played Acquire with have found its concept rather difficult to grasp. Perhaps it is because we have a very remote understanding of the business world, but it makes little sense to expand a corporation in hopes that it will be acquired, or to be unable to sell stocks until the corporation is acquired.

However, Acquire performs quite well on its own economic terms. In essence, this is a game of balancing between getting stocks in corporations which will be eventually acquired, and stocks in predicted 'safe' corporations. (Or at least, that's what I think.) The one thing that irks me is the luck of the draw in the tiles. Getting money from early mergers seems to be rather valuable, but if your tiles give no indication which company may be acquired, then the expansion of corporations is at the mercy of your opponents. In many ways, Acquire plays like the inverse of [thing=90419][/thing] – the expansion of companies is semi-random, while the acquisition of stocks is fully decided by the player.

Nevertheless, Acquire is a rather fascinating classic title. It has met a less-than-lukewarm reception from the people I have played with, which is a pity because this is a game which requires a play or two for it to make sense.

[82 plays] Sid Sackson's classic work, a pioneering game that can play quickly and tensely with any good gaming group.

We were playing and enjoying the old 3M bookcase version of Acquire a decade or more before any of us had heard of "German" games. It was one of the first games that revealed to some of us that there were some really nifty games out there besides the wargames we knew.

I have played enough Acquire to realize that there is some amount of skill and tactics required to put yourself in position to win if fate smiles upon you, but that ultimately a good player has absolutely no control over the lucky twists of fate that will occur at key moments in the first 2/3rds of the game.

Most recent plays 6-12-05, 12-10-06, and then 2-8-09. Jerry, Ben, Mindy, Garrett, and Barb. Most recently 11-26-10 in KC with Steve, Barb, Jerry, Vallie, and Garrett.

Old AH Bookshelf edition off Ebay.com.au. Finally.

A classic for good reason. Players are putting chips onto a board to build hotel chains. Money is used to buy shares which are then sold for money and worth $$$ when small chains are bought over.

Not very heavy but it's a classic case of 'too much to do' 'too little money/actions' to do it. Sackson is genius.

It was around 40 years when the game first came out before I got to play it. After playing it I wished I had gotten a copy sooner. It sure beats Monoply to have as a family game or a light game amoung friends.  The tile drawing placement keeps the game fresh and play different each play. If a family or a person has a game library it should be in it.

Splendid, elegant game that was way ahead of its time. Even after all these years, I can't think of a game in the same niche that compares to Acquire.

It's disappointing that Hasbro wasn't willing to invest in plastic pieces in the latest version of this game.

This game is less luck-driven than I had originally thought.  Having the right tile at the right time is of course very helpful, but there's more to it than just that.  Acquire is older than I am, and it still puts most newer games to shame.  It's also a great gateway game in my experience.

*****

I've played this quite a bit recently at www.gethostile.com.  Believe it or not, the best player does actually seem to win the majority of the time.  Really bad luck can ruin you every once in a while, but you have more control over your fate than you may think.  Focus early on getting at least minority control in corporations near each other and ignore lone corporations by the edge of the board.  And sometimes it's better to just hold on to your money early on if it seems like that first merger may not come any time soon.

Excellent game; I can see why this one has stayed in print for so long.  Great decisions to be made every round.
----
This game delights several of my sensibilities.  First, it's a game of stock and money management.  You buy the stock certificates, and by adding to the corporation, the value of the certificates increases.

Second it's a tactical game where a player has to make a determination by the tiles held as to whether to buy further into a chain if it can be merged, or to make that merger, or to continue to grow a small corporation so that it goes safe and cannot be merged (especially if opponents are holding quantities of stock in that corporation, and would benefit greatly from it merging out).

Third, I love the whole nature of the stock majorities -- a player has to keep a little bit of a mind about what the other players are holding, but only to the point that that player wants to be one ahead of all the other players in order to claim the majority shareholder bonus when that stock merges.

I might give it another point or two if the bits weren't so dreadful in my copy. Just the right level of abstraction, for me, anyway. Very easy to teach and learn, and with a lot of replay value.

Dropped rating after many more plays. A great game, but the luck factor is pretty heavy. There's often one player who has no interesting decisions to make at all.

I have heard almost mystical claims of some sort of strategy to this that completely mitigates the luck, but I remain skeptical.

Definitely a fun game. Can go long if played with AP (analysis paralysis) people. Love the mergers mechanic. Also, this game is actually quite thematic to me, believe it or not. I know it really shouldn't be, as it is quite abstract to look at, but with all the money and the mergers and the cool buildings (if you have the Avalon Hill Hasbro '99) and the old school feel of the stocks, I really feel like a major mogul looking down from a thousand feet on the city that i'm trying to utterly dominate. 

There is surely a luck driven mechanic of picking tiles, and that does bug, but it's not too bad.

Great game of speculation.  The board is a grid, from 1-A to 12-I.  Players have a "hand" of 6 tiles that can be placed where indicated on the grid.  On your turn, you simply play a tile and purchase up to three shares of stock in one of 7 hotel corporations.  If a tile is played that connects orthogonally to another single tile, a hotel corporation has been created (or resurrected).  If a tile is played that connects two corporations, a merger occurs.  The smaller company is absorbed and its stockholders cash in or trade their stock.  The goal is to maximize stock holdings in corporations that you control the fate of (using your hand tiles) or speculate in other corporations.  Most money wins.  
3p game is not worth it, as one player always eats it early.  6p is too chaotic.  5 is best, but 4 isn't bad.

RATING: 9
Works best with 5 or 6.  With three, it sometimes has "runaway leader syndrome".  This is prevented in games with more players by players being unable to commit all of their money before a sufficient number of tiles have been played.

NOTE:  The components are CONSIDERABLY better in older versions and, in one recent edition, the height of the hotel markers is a significant line-of-sight problem.

a wonderfully tense, highly interactive game with just the right amount of cutthroat.

RATING: 9
So many games have taken elements of Acquire. Yet in many ways, none have surpassed it. Unlike derivatives like Airlines Europe, this can be a brutal, cutthroat game, and it's incredibly tense. Often you know what you want to do but you can't quite do it on your turn. So you wait, watching anxiously as others change your plans--or not. Most of the game is like this. There's so much tension that the end of the game can be downright cathartic.

I got killed on my first play, completely cut out of contention early on, but that's not a dealbreaker for me. I'm glad I persisted with another play because I fared much better the second go around. Winning is satisfying. There might be a bit too much randomness in the tile draw, but there's a lot of subtlety to the strategy. It's an excellent design, all the more astounding given its age.

Decent game considering it's age. The random tile draw and "betting" on the wrong properties can leave a player strapped for cash with nothing to do on their turn and that's a bit of a sticking point for me.

RATING: 5
I've discovered that I'm really "new school" when it comes to my board games.  Except for Boggle (and a couple Chess boards and a novelty version of Yahtzee), this is the oldest game I own by more than 30 years.

It's very watered down for my usual tastes.  Gameplay consists of playing tiles on a board to start, expand, or merge hotel chains.  Then you buy stocks, trying to predict which ones will grow so you can buy as low as possible and sell them for huge profits by the end of the game.  The player with the most money at the end wins.

I think this game is certainly better with more people.  It can accommodate up to 6 and that may be too many (I've never played with that number) but with 3 or fewer it is too easy to run away with the game.  More players offers more competition and gaps between your turns and dilutes the available stock.  With three you can see what tiles you have available and buy up huge amounts of stock early before other players have time to react and attempt to thwart your plan or prevent you from a big pay-out.

I've enjoyed Power Grid and have intended on playing a deeper economic game for some time but this certainly isn't it.  This is much more shallow an experience although it does play reasonably quickly and may fill a shorter time slot if players are looking for a quick buy and sell stock game.

It's a good tense game. It's fun and clever. Very easy to explain and a good possibility to newbies, I think. 

I still wonder if luck weights too much on the game's result. Have to play it again.

6/07/2008
Played it again with 4 players.
Luck has a major role during the game. The opportunity to make mergers makes the difference. If a player doesn't have the tiles for it gets too much dependent of whatever the other players do. I still like the game, of course, but because of that, I can't rate it higher than a 6.

A true classic, which I'm glad to have in my collection. It may be a bit dated compared with recent offshoots like Union Pacific and Stephenson's Rocket, but still holds its own. The luck of the draw doesn't really bother me, as there are many ways to circumvent bad draws with clever play. By the way, I'm firmly on the open holdings side. Closed holdings only introduces unnecessary AP, as players struggle to remember who has what.

Warning people with poor memories may not like this game, since there's some memorization involved.
You MUST buy the 1999 out of print version, the newer cardboard version is garbage.
We've had a few annoying rounds of this lately where the top 2 guys in the first merger won the game, and everyone else could do little about it.  There's some randomness here that can ruin the round.  I think this was because we had 5-6 players, a lot of tiles got held.  3-4 players seems to be a little more fun.

Netacquire is a great way to play. -2007

RATING: 7.5
[3M 1971 Bookshelf Edition] {Hotel business; stock holding, tile-laying; optimal 4-6p} Acquire is a vintage stock speculation game.  To me, it is the masterpiece of Sid Jackson. Acquire is quite unforgiving and takes some time to master. It's great in the old time but it's still good in current gaming world.  It is quite abstract and opaque, which may not be fun for some players.  Nevertheless, it's a first-rate game which provides different strategies and lots of player interaction.

It needs a good strategy to develop a stock. The decision each turn is clear if a player has a definite plan to make money. Besides, maintaining a good cash flow is very important in this game; therefore players should be ready for quick merges, in addition to develop stocks. There is some luck in tile draws but it can usually be countered by wise moves (There are 6 tiles in a player's hand. Unless he has really bad luck, it's not usual that he has all useless and unfavorable tiles).

[Variant] If your game group extremely hates luck, you may use a variant to reduce the luck: when drawing a tile, a player draws 2 tiles, keeps 1 for himself and return the other to the supply. I don't think this variant is necessary, though.

 2 points for the "game emeritus" status.  I guess the two things I took away from this game are:

1.  It's an outstanding design in the context of its time.  Given the level of game designs that were its contemporaries, this is a really interesting game.

2.  Having said that, it's now a dated game.  I played this right after playing a game called Arkadia, and all I could think while playing Acquire is just how many decisions were being taken out of my hands by the tiles that were drawn.  The good Eurogames avoid throwing these huge curveballs at you based on randomness and allow the system to evolve its own complexity with almost everything out in the open.  If I get a smattering of tiles that are around the edge of the mapboard at the beginning, or otherwise away from the first 3-4 companies that get formed, I'm in trouble through no fault of my own.  And these days there are games that have all the fun of Acquire in terms of calculating payoffs, reading other's behaviour, etc. and don't randomly screw you that way.  So why would I play this one?

I'm new to the Acquire scene, but in the past year it has become our most often-played board game.  Very fun.  Stay away from Union Pacific, a sad ripoff of this classic game, and boring besides.

I bought this after reading about it's legacy on BGG. Played it a few times with just my girlfriend. I'm finding it hard to share the enthousiasm with other comments about this game, but maybe it has to grow on me. I'll update this after I played some 3 or more player games.

Update : revisited this game 5 years later and much much better. This is a 4+ player game for sure. Loved it!

This game seems, recently, to have attracted debate as to whether it&#039;s as good as the contemporary German games it&#039;s inspired. Either way, truly seminal. Elegant, perfectly austere rules; easy to teach.
Too bad the corporate theme is so unappealing.

This game is ok, but every time I play it I get really frustrated because of how luck based it is.  You can buy the "right" stocks all along, but if you don't draw the tiles you need to force a merger that is good for you early in the game, you can run out of money and have nothing to do for the rest of the game.

Played 5+ times.  This is a classic.  A great game.
**UPDATE** I still find this really fun to play, but more often it's coming down to good tile draws. (that statement may show my incompetence with the game).  An early merger (one turn start company, buy 3 shares, followed by a merger the following turn) gives the majority holder enough cash to out buy everyone else in shares. A well played share lead is really difficult to beat.   2009/05/01

Buy a hotel chain and build it up, make money from its sale.  This is my favorite economic strategy game (but I am not a lover or economic games).  So far, my favorite version is the AH (WOTC)version based on the quality of the components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A great light strategy game that works well with non-gamers.  Interesting decisions to be made trying to balance long-term objectives (projecting which company will be the biggest by game end and investing there, but getting no immediate payoff) and short-term pressures of needing money (investing where takeovers are likely to occur in the short-term so that you can get a boost of funds).  One glaring weakness though (in desperate need of a house rule to fix) is the situation where someone runs out of money (due to bad luck) and can do nothing while another player gets lucky (through a random tile draw) and has one of his companies acquired, giving him the money to continue purchasing stock.  That player then vaults ahead quickly and end game result becomes fairly predictable.

Finally got this to the table, was pretty hard seeing all the component rich competition.

However, the game was really fun. We had one chain in the end completely dominating the table but all of us could already see the different ways of strategy to win this game.

As for play it is a mix between spatial tile laying and a stock game. However, the last is absolutely prevalent. Try to 'buy in' to the right chains and try to have others do your work. And know when to keep and when to sell stock. You don't want to run low on money!!

Great game, in the end we finished with just $100 difference with scores of the top players ranging in the 50K.

I'd feel mildly positive about playing this again, hence a 6. On the good side, there is a good expansion mechanic and even better stock ownership system that allows you to purchase more. The rules are clean, the mechanics are not over wrought, so it's quiet professional.

The biggest shortcoming is the timeframe. It is too long (2 hrs for 5 of us, mostly newbies) for what it very tedious at times. And there's not enuf excitement packed into that. If you made this many decisions in 45 min. it would be excellent. This is a good example of a game that would likely benefit from a jump start, if you could set up this game, so it was at the midway pt. where the strategies and choices come alive it would be far better. So game is sort of weak for me in the areas of: play time, and drama/excitement. 

There are variants to speed this up, so this may help. It also feels rather dry. I dont recall making any real deals with players (going from memory) so maybe that hurts the flavor.

A slightly dry, mathy game that everyone should probably try at least once.

It doesn't really compare to many modern games, but wouldn't look massively out of place in a collection.

Update: the game is better than I originally gave it credit for. Cashflow really is king and getting cut out of the first few deals can be devastating. It also has possibly the same problem with T&E in that an unfair number of turns can be significant. You certainly want to be the one to end the game.

A friend broke this game out while over at his house.  The closest game I could liken it to was Tigris and Euprates.  There were several similarities, with the main difference in scoring.

RATING: 8
One of the first economic games I played, and, especially after Monopoly, was an entirely new experience. After many plays, and many other economic games, this one still holds up. Some people dislike the random tile draws. I find that strategic play still carries the day, especially if you get the player count right. For my tastes, the game is best with four. Six is simply too chaotic. Four seems to strike a perfect balance between control and luck of the draw.

That said, the game does show its age. I've never been impressed with the components. And this is coming from a guy who used to own the fabled 1999 Avalon Hill edition with pretty plastic pieces. I sold that edition in exchange for the more portable (and therefore more likely to be played) cardboard edition. After some upgrades to the racks and the addition of a draw bag, it's not so bad! But I'd love to see something that blended the best of both worlds.

Finally, it's a game that demands repeat plays. Especially because mitigating the luck of the draw takes experience, you have to know a bit about what you're trying to do in order to avoid getting stymied mid-game with little cash and even fewer options.

With stock games like Chicago Express available, Acquire doesn't hit the table as often at it used to, but it's still one of my favorites for its simplicity and its subtle opportunities for skillful play.

Lots of fun to play, although luck plays a fairly large role. When teaching it's best to let new players know that being the smaller company in a merger can be a good thing, and even a necessary thing early in the game. If a player misses out on a cash payout early in the game, they will have a miserable time.

What a great game. I can't believe that if this has been around so long that it isn't in teh public domain (at least in the UK). Nice and easy to play with a whole load of subtlety to it. And I don't see that it's obviously been copied - there are some borrowings of elements of the mechanics - tile-laying in Carc has a nod towards this, and the multiple owning of states in Imperial is kind of derived from this I think, but otherwise it stands very much as it's own game. Relatively quick, no-one really sure who's winning, refined play, and simple rules. This game takes some beating.
This is one of my happiest gaming personal discoveries. Thank you Geek!

RATING: 5
Universally acclaimed as a classic, and given its longevity and legions of fans, that's a tough point to argue. It's certainly well designed. For me, though, the game feels devoid of any semblance of warmth, charm, theme or flavor. Strategy is possible, but only if the right tiles fall your way at the right time. It's cold, analytical, abstract and not a whole heck of a lot of fun. Guess if I'm looking for a Sid Sackson classic, I'll stick with Can't Stop which, while equally abstract, nevertheless has all the charisma and accessibility Acquire lacks.

OK - I'm biased. I played this game back in the 60's with my dad, again and again. I loved it then and I still love it now.  My son and two nephews played it over Thanksgiving, the three of them for the first time, and everyone had a great time.  As my son said, "It really grows on you."  Easy to get into, becomes deeper and more competitive as the game progresses, and when we finished, all three of them were ready for another game.

We played the 1965 version; if you can grab one - do it.

This was the first real (german-style) board game I ever played. I loved it immediately and as a result it hols a special place in my heart. Unfortunately, I've played it a number of times recently and seen that it has some serious flaws in keeping some players in the game until the end. I played a game (4 players) where one player nearly got shut out of the game entirely until counting the money at the end. 

The game plays best as a 3 player game, though I have yet to try it as a 5+ player game. But I feel like as the number of players increases and the time between turns grows, the problems with the game will become more apparent.

Want to add an economic game to our repertoire such as this, or suggest another one.

We play with a house rule of one wild tile to give the players a little strategic choice. It probably breaks the game but we don't know that.

Can't believe I waited so long to play this oldie but so goodie! Love how easy it it is to learn and play. Only downside is the randomness of the tiles you draw. It sucks when every tile you have is good for your opponents, but awful for you.

The trick with stock market games is making the side game compelling enough that you care about the stock itself.  Acquire strikes the perfect chord between elegance, luck, and analysis.  The components are a bit grim in presentation but the game is immersive.  And thankfully, the market is bidirectional:  you can buy AND sell stock for a very fluid game.

Economic tile-laying game. Each player invests in hotels, trying to retain a majority of stock. As their empire grows with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.

I finally played this about a month back, and have played it two more times since. I love it. It's simplicity meeting complexity throughout. On a player's turn, he does very little mechanically, but what every play does to the game state is complex and deep. This is a must-have game for gamers, and especially for economic gamers.

Everybody should replace their copy of Monopoly with this game.

This is a great game. A great game to move to after Catan, and to introduce people to economic concepts.

Still, the game provides interesting decisions and has interesting mechanics.

This is simply the best economic game I've ever played.  I can play this game on autopilot and have a great time, or play it full force, and also have a great time.  So many minor rules feel so cleverly utilized, at least in my experiences.  Only knock on it in my opinion is that sometimes I feel tile drawing luck can lead to unrightful winners, and it is hard to catch up if you play poorly early.  Still fantastic though

I was actually a bit disapointed playing this after hearing how wonderful it was. There's clear strategy here around timing and positioning, but the options are so few that the game felt dry to me.

Letter Grade: A.  Timeless gameplay.  Scales like a champ, providing interesting but starkly different experiences throughout the play range. [05-08-09]  

Great endgame with strategic decisions througout.  More players equals a more jumpy game environment, with exponentially increasing tension.
UPDATE: I've moved this up to a 9, not after repeated plays but after realizing it's been a long time since I've played anything that's replicated the tension in my last Acquire game.

First Impression:
This is essentially a tile-placing game with a lot of prediction involved. 

However it is too chaotic to make any long term strategy and you are seriously restricted by your hand, which may or may not allow you some insight into what will or what won't happen in the game.

In the end, it doesn't get me at all and feels awfully outdated as a game.

I like the idea of a game about stocks and saw that this was actually very highly rated. Having played it I can't quite tell you why. I guess it's okay game mechanics, but the way to compete with the others is quite dull. Despite how it appears, there really isn't much strategy except some simple math, having just more than your opponent, and hoping the battle each other on certain stocks. After that it's all luck of the draw. It didn't really immerse me into the stock trading world.

In this case less control = more fun.  The 5 and 6 player game, creates the players to read their opponents actions to see their move.  In the 3 player game, it just seems to come down to the tile draw too much.  I'd play if someone was clamoring for it, and I'm appreciative of its creativity and innovation.  I just think its been borrowed from and improved upon too much these days.

One of the all time classics.  A superior game in every way.  I have the old AH bookcase version as well as the 95 version (the one with the Special Powers Variant) in the big box...with the new version coming out soon I figured I'd revisit this in my thoughts and well going ahead and pumping it up to the coveted 10 spot. This game does deserve it from me. 

UPDATE: I Love the 1965 AH Bookcase edition which I feel is the most functional of all versions. It's small and the plastic pieces seat nicely onto the board keeping things from sliding around like crazy. Thrift store find for $1.49 in complete and what I would rank as EXCELLENT condition.

Additionally I own the 1995 AH version with the "Power Tiles" which I feel completely unbalances the game. Obviously AH thought so too as this is the only edition with the stupid tiles. This edition had a nice look to it though with the lovely board printed wonderfully. Thrift store find for $0.49. Condition was new...the game had never been played all stock cards had HARD/SHARP corners and were still stuck together. However it was w/o shrink wrap and the box suffered water damage and split corners. 

I just got my copy of the 2008 edition as I love the look of it. Smaller size is nice, and lower price is GREAT in my opinion. People here on the geek want to complain about the "quality of the bits" but hey a lower price point very well may go a long way to exposing NEW PEOPLE to this game and gaming in general! Bravo AH on this excellent edition.

RATING: 5
SOLD (5/10/08) -- While I don't think this is a bad game, I have two major problems with it:

1) If you're not involved in the first or second merger, you're out without much chance of winning.  You need your company to go defunct quickly to get a majority or minority bonus right away.

2) More often than not, all 6 of the tiles you're holding don't do anything at all, and you can't help but place one of them completely randomly because none of them add to an existing corporation, join corporations, or present the possibility of forming a corporation; they're just off in the middle of nowhere. This is particularly true in the first half of any game.

I have never understood what people see in this game. It's alright, but I feel like I must be missing something, perhaps nostalgia?

Received as gift: Date unknown
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic that I wish I got to play more than I do. By keeping your money and stocks secret, it can be a big surprise as to who ends up as the majority and minority stock holder. Really gives a feeling of rags to riches. I wish I had the plastic version of this one.

The random tile drawing can be a little chaotic, and there is potential to get completely hosed from the beginning if you add poor play to the random tile draw.  The real drawback for me is that this is another stock market game that I just kind of suck at (I don't think I've ever perfectly timed selling off a company).  The elegant design is a classic for a reason, but I've never finished a game of this wanting to play again.

I have to say, I don't get this one's appeal.  Get caught in a bad start by other's moves and have no tiles that let you work with what you have and you're pretty much going through the motions.  I'd probably play this rather than basketball; but not rather than most tabletop games I know.

We play with open holdings. Can be an exciting game, the key is cashing in on a merger early in the game. If you don't, your opponents will quickly use their new found cash to achieve dominance in your stock areas. Maybe this is a symptom of playing with open holdings, more playing may be in order.

WOW, what a game. While reading the rules we were just thinking "fusions-what?" but during play we didn't even need a look at those rules. It's very easy to learn but hard to master.

There is high player interaction. Players need to react to one other's action. 

The newer version which we owned is not as aesthetic compared to the older version which come with 3D hotel building. 

Game end does not occurs automatically. One of the requirement to calculate the number of tiles before a player can declare game end make it a bit tedious. 

*Edit: Upgraded the game from 6.5 to 7.5. The 3D components make the game more enjoyable for me.

*Second edit: From 7.5 to 8.5. The game experience improves with more plays.

Simple but elegant, this game really scratches an itch. It's never clear who is ahead, especially if you play with secret shares and money. (Personally, I play open shares, secret money.)

The newest released edition is playable, but made more cheaply than I prefer, 2 decks of cards were die-cut slightly different sized (annoying). I recently "acquired" another copy with decks cut out of the same die, so I now feel much better about this edition. Perhaps my original copy was just an error in production.

This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher. Each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock. As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.

Very simple, very smart.  A boiled down stock market experience.  Any economic fan needs to own this as filler.  The spacial element is secondary to the abstract element of valuing shares.  Thematically this simulates what markets actually are, barely related to the real world.  

But the random tile draw is annoying and sometimes you can't engineer any ideas.  You need to play this quickly or you'll get annoyed at not having any control.

I've played this since I was a teenager and it has been over a decade since I revisited it.  The principal problem, for me at least, is that building cubical hotel chains just doesn't inspire me.

The only board game from the 60's that still merits play at our gaming tables.   Still plays fresh and challenging after many years.

A classic Sackson game. This however, is a really darn good game. A very basic economics game but a really really solid design. I can't help but feel that this game really does reflect the ebb and flow of buying stocks and the tense nature of corporate mergers.. I can really see why this game has withstood the test of time and still remain in the top 100. 

02/2018: 6
Almost a decade later, the game is still solid. However, having played many more games in the interim, there are a few flaws in the game. If you don't have good cash flow and participate in initial mergers to get some cash, you will have a tough time catching up especially if the two larger companies start to form and you don't have any shares in it. There is a rich-get-richer flow to the game where players that can cash in early on the mergers will get more money to compete for shares in other companies. There is no apparent catch up mechanism in the game other than trying to buy early in younger companies. Given how old this game is, it is remarkably streamlined and fits the economic theme to the T. This is certainly Sackson at his best and you really can't fault this design. However, this is not a game for newbies and requires a few plays to see emergent properties of the game.

Sackson's masterpiece still compares favorably to games released today, 45 years later, which you really can't say for more than a few games from that era. Acquire is fantastic, agonizing fun. My only complaints about the game are that sometimes, you can get hosed by the tile draws, and sometimes, the game can pretty much be decided by the first and second mergers. Open holdings is preferable with 5 or 6, though I think you could go either way with 3 or 4 players.

I really didn't like this game.  Maybe it's because I'm not a capitalist and I don't endorse giant corporations.

RATING: 8
I've probably played more games of Acquire over the course of my life than any other game - and I'm still happy to get it out and play it yet again.

I own the 1998/99 Avalon Hill/Hasbro edition with incredibly beautiful components.  The component quality in the currently-in-print AH edition isn't as high, but still pretty nice.  If you are looking to pick up Acquire, put in a bit of legwork and see if you can get the older one first.

Many define Acquire as an economic game, but in truth it's more of an abstract with an economic theme pasted on.  It could be almost exactly the same game with biological entities, farms, or anything else.  Power Grid is an economic game - Acquire is not.

This is a universal recommend - give it a try, no matter your tastes.

1st impression: Fun M&A game. I'd like to play again to see how deep the strategy goes - I suspect not very far. I suspect that once everyone knows what they are doing then the game boils down to tracking majorities and luck.

On the plus side, though, I do like how each player knows some perfect information (their tiles, and their shares), but how valuable that info is depends on how the other players play the game. Through careful observation you can therefore gain clues about their set of information, and add this to your set accordingly. This, of course, is exactly what every good economic game strives for.

I like the theme, no wait I love the theme. However this game has a lot of luck in it. You can of course study what the others are doing and try to adjust thereafter.

I like the mechanic and how quickly the game plays. I have played with teams of two with six players and it adds a fun new strategic level to the game. Each person plays as individually but can talk and strategize with their teammate. The turn order goes A1,B1,C1,A2,B2,C2 where teams are (A1,A2),(B1,B2) and (C1,C2). At the end of the game the total amount of money for each team is scored.

Classic hotel chain building and stock speculation tile-laying game. Was finally introduced to Acquire in June 2008 and absolutely loved it. I can definitely understand its longevity and devout following. Mechanics are at par with modern Euros - a clean, simple design that works. And fun too. The tile draw adds that level of chaos that makes every game unique. I expect to continue enjoying this gem for a long time.

The first time I played Acquire I thought it would be a definite 10 for me. I usually try not to comment on games until a 2nd or 3rd play, unless I feel like I have a really good grasp of the game. Nevertheless, usually my rating will move by 1, but rarely more after a 2nd play. So I was surprised last night after my 2nd play that my rating dropped about three points to a 7. In a 5 player game, after about the 4th or 5th round of tile playing I found myself entirely out of cash. This would have been alright had something I had an interest in been acquired. As it was not, and as I had no way to trigger the event myself, I spent the rest of the game (1 hr. plus) on the sidelines, watching with no meaningful engagement in the game. Indeed, the rules give the dire warning to mind your cash lest you wind up in my unfortunate situation. Generally, I like unforgiving games, I even seek them out: bring on the punishment of tight money I say! But in the case of Acquire, it seemed like the tight cash situation-- unlike Imperial for example-- can come about through a sort of capricious, uncontrolable (random) path. In other words, tight, unforgiving games that you leave you stranded from poor play: mmmm, gooooood; tight, unforgiving games that leave you stranded from a series of random events: not as tasty. So I will definitely play this again, and perhaps (hopefully!) I'll discover that this truly is mmmmmm, good, kind of unforgiving and that I just played poorly. But until then, I'll "usually be willing to play" vs. "Always want to play and never expect that to change."

A good fun game. My only issue is that it might be a little unforgiving - if someone spends all his money before any mergers occur, or doesn't get the right tiles, they can be left with many turns with nothing to do but place a tile. Feels a little dated in this respect, but incredibly clever for its era.

The first time I have read the rules I was puzzled as I could not imagine what kind of game it is going to be at that time. The mechanics of this game is very different from the games that I have known. After a few games I understand the idea and enjoyed it very much. All my friends that have played it liked it and it is one of my most popular games. Generally it will not be the reason for us to get together but it will be a good side dish among the main course (the more complex game). It is also good if you have not got time for a long game. Hasbro edition’s pieces are very good quality and it is good to play in such a colorful setting. I have played more than 30 times until now and every game of Acquire happens to be very different from the earlier ones.

I recently obtained a 1968 vintage copy from Ebay, and played it for the first time last night with my aunt and uncle.  It was a BLAST!!!!  Definitely a much better money/finance/investment game than, let's say, Monopoly.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and highly recommend it!  Does involve a substantial amount of luck, but strategy plays a role as well.

Admirable for its time, really boring now.  Feels stale and played-out.  The mechanics just aren't interesting enough for me to stick with the rather boring theme.  Nothing is going to save you if you don't draw the tiles you need.

Finally played this old classic. Simple to pick up and play, but a lot going on strategy wise to make the most money. Took me most of my first game to see how everything was going to work together, as I got caught out with one particular stock emptying before I could cash in. I can see why some folks play this over and over again.

It is exciting for me to hope for the right tile to help or to destroy my opponents while helping myself.
However, the game has too much calculation in it.  It has better balance with more than three players.

(7/09)  My first play of this classic - 3 players.   What was I waiting for?   I really enjoyed the tile laying, mergers, majority/minority, share price, etc - all simple concepts wrapped into a quick financial game.  Looking forward to more plays with 4/5/6 players.

A classic that holds up well with time.  However, it definitely is a game that one either gets or doesn't (I have a friend who falls into the "doesn't get" category)

I enjoy this game a lot, especially with casual or non-gamers. You ave to accept that there is an aspect of memorization or you will have no fun. But using the limited information you have from your own tiles and waching other players' actions to guess which companies are going to merge is delightful. The game does have a problem in that if you miss out on some of the ealrier mergers you will run out of money to invest which is a setback you usually cannot overcome later

This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher. Each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock. As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth. I have a recent AH version. 1999 - Avalon Hill large box version. Plastic tile "caps" for gridded board. Chain markers are buildings of three different heights. Theme has been changed from hotels to technology corporations. Went out of print around 2004-05.

The most amazing thing about this game is its pedigree, considering it was released back in the 1960s.  The game isn't without its issues (it seems like every time I play this game now, it's with a different set of house rules to balance out some strong elements), but it's still a finely balanced game between its actions and the reward associated with each one.  I think I still prefer Shark over Acquire (at the very least, it improves the randomness issue), but I wouldn't turn down a play of this every once in a while, either.

The first time I played this at a friend's house, I felt like I was just being swept along. I couldn't really comprehend the possible consequences of my various actions. I made a late surge in the final disposition of stocks and finished 3rd out of 6. 

My one knock on Acquire is that sometimes you can't draw the tiles you need and run out of money as other players initiate mergers that help them but not you. I've since come to prefer Union Pacific when I want to play a stock game. 

This is still an excellent game, though.

Fun game if you play with open hand shares.  If you play with closed, depending which group you play with the game becomes more serious and a little less social.

Update :  Yes, this is a memory and maths game.  It is a good game but I have found that after the game everyone is on a bit of a downer and due to this I don't enjoy it socially.  If however it was released as a computer game where being thinky and self absorbed don't matter I would enjoy it.  Will not be recommending this unless someone requests it.

Aquire was the first big game purchase for me.  As such, this game, along with "Through the Desert", has a special place in my collection.  Of course, the fact that I love the game helps as well.  I will admit that the game can be a bit unforgiving to new players, as it is easy to run out of money if you don't have a merger early in the game.

Aquire fue el primer juego "grande" que compré.  Como tal, este juego, junto con "A Través del Desierto", tiene un lugar especial en mi colección.  Por supuesto, el hecho de que este juego me encanta no estorba.  Tengo que admitir que el juego puede ser un poco difícil para jugadores nuevos, ya que es fácil quedarse sin dinero si no hay una adquisición temprana.

A shelf-worn 1966 Bookshelf Edition of Acquire is one of the few heirlooms that survived my biological father, who drowned when I was a 3-month old.  I've moved it from place to place, opened it a few times, and thought "what is this— Scrabble with money?" 

25 years later, when I finally broke it out for a game, I noticed how extremely well-loved (but complete!) the  components were, the cards with creases and rounded corners, the faded board, chipped in a few places... and an hour or so into a game with my wife and two good friends, I found out why.  

Even without the obviously colossal amounts of sentiment surrounding my copy of this game, I'd still give it a 9+.  The only bummer is that it has taken me this long to find out that my dad and I would've had such similar tastes in gaming!

Elegant and entertaining tile placement. Got rid of this one because everyone in both of my gaming groups hated it, calling it "chaotic"; I wouldn't go that far, but in each game I played there was one person who didn't ever seem to have any worthwhile tiles available. I've also never played it with fewer than 5, so that could've been part of the issue.

is if you ground a hotel you
need to buy 3 of this hotel or

Excellent game. First time play left me wanting to "have at it immediately again." I royally screwed up the game for everyone else since I discoved I was "color-blind" this game. Tweaks' 3M version of the game only has colored chains with no other identifying traits, such as a letter. Dorko I was, I kept nabbing up the wrong shade of greens/blues. Crikey, I handed the game to Tweaks who was seated to my left. Sorry guys!

Even all my bad plays doesn't detract from the game. I can't wait to play it again - no wonder it's been in print for over 40 years.

It was one of my top ranked games for a long time, but I've recently dropped it a bit. I still love the game, it's just not as nearly perfect as I once thought it was.

Hm. I keep feeling like I'm on the edge of a breakthrough with this, but it never arrives. I can see the genius of it, so I want to keep trying, but it does have a lot of negative elements that make it akin to a number of traditional American games: creeping incrementalism, significant luck of the draw, and too little drama/angst (see creeping incrementalism).

Played once and was not impressed. The game appears to punish you for investing in companies that succeed because you don't get your money back and the tile drawing is just too random to be balanced.

The components were pretty shoddy too. You need to make the cardboard tile racks from their printed card sheets and you tear our the last page of the rule book to make reference sheets.

That being said I do want to try again with some rule tweaks

RATING: 6
Acquire is a solidly "good" game.  At its core is a sort of puzzle-like game about chosing the best times and places to lay your tiles and managing your investment in the various companies.  Knowing which companies to invest stock in, anticipating mergers so that they play favorably for you and how to stay ahead of the other players in holding majority shares, all play important roles.

It is a very family-friendly game and probably ought to replace Monopoly in the casual American household as it features more meaningful strategy, no player-elimination and a much shorter length of play (90 minutes or so).

As an economic/stock market game, it can be a little math-y at times when players must decide how to optimally trade/sell shares but no moreso than most any other game of its genre.

Nothing about Acquire screams with excitement but its gameplay is simple, quick and timeless.  There is a reason it has existed in one edition or another for half a century.

Not a favorite game but definitely a good one. I really like the mechanics (the Scrabble-like tile system and the placement restrictions) and I am indifferent to the theme. I found it went a little slowly but overall enjoyed myself, even if it is not a light game. Good times. :)

I bought the latest reprint of this game but I'd downloaded the rules from the AH/WotC site a number of years ago when they still had it in print to see if I wanted to buy it. I did but was just barely too late. So, I compared the new and old rules set due to a comment the rules had changed. I see no difference although the rules are rewritten except the old comment players should decide beforehand whether the show or conceal assets is no longer included. Since nothing is said about this one way or the other in the new edition of the rules, it's still a good idea.

It's a good game and an economic strategy game but this doesn't have the "thrill of conquest" that gets the blood pumping.

See review.

This is one of the games that got me into board gaming.  Back in the late '60s, my parents and their friends would get together on Friday nights and if it wasn't bridge or hearts this game would be on the table.  It was so exciting to hear the fun and energy buying stock and creating mergers.  I remember it being a big deal for me when I was old enough to join in when they were a player short.

I always thought this game was over-rated.  I mean, it's OK, and I've had it for decades, but the decisions seem a bit limited.  Rheinlander (Knizia) has a similar placement scheme, but more strategy AND you don't have to fiddle around with paper money.

While holding a merge tile can make this more dramatic and interesting, it's still a fine game deserving of its revered status.

I routinely expect so-called "classics" to be either marginal or completely awful (Empire Builder, Talisman, etc.), but that just isn't the case here.  Consider the fact that, since Acquire's creation,  no other merger game has even come close to its level of ingenuity or replayability.

Played twice. I had bad memories from the first session a long time ago, but the second one has not really improved my opinion.

This one is beginning to feel dated -- more numbers than it should need to keep in my head to play competively.

Played only one game, in which I didn't pay enough attention to the tiles I had. I couldn't merge any of the smaller chains I had invested in, so I didn't have any cash to buy new stock. 

After a series of unlucky draws, I ended up losing majority (and minority) stock in each chain, and could only play tiles that benefit other players. 

Would love to play again, if only to find out whether you can negate bad draws with better use of stock buying.

[-]Good[/-]Excellent game.  I have the new version and though the mechanics are wonderful I wish the cardstock was just a little bit heavier.  Also, I have a difficult time telling the difference between the red and orange.  At least the hotels are oriented differently which helps to tell the difference.

UPDATE: This is indeed an excellent game and I can't wait to play it more often.  I can see playing this one more for years to come.

I like this game quite a bit, though it can be a hard sell and it doesn't come out as much as I'd like - something about the theme of buying stocks in companies as you build them doesn't always appeal to others. It could also be that I own the old plain Jane 3M Bookshelf edition, not the out-of-print Avalon Hill version with the nice game pieces. 

Either way, a great game with lots of strategy with some luck mixed in with the drawing of tiles. I don't know that I've won this game all that much, but I enjoy playing it even when getting stomped by my betters.

RATING: 1
In Acquire, players basically all perform the same strategy: create two-square chains and obtain 4 shares upon initiation while either fighting for minority shareholder in another company or buying stock for cheap in a company destined to exist until the end of the game. Who wins? The people that are fortunate to start with tiles near the middle of the board where their company is more likely to get gobbled up sooner? Or even draw the tiles necessary to form a hotel chain at a reasonable time in the first place? (Gotta love those opening turns where first player has no chain so he dumps a random tile which arbitrarily helps another player create one.) Or how about the folks who are fortunate nobody adds to their chain, making it too big to get bought out and thus less profitable because there's no acquisition bonus? It's a monotonous process that becomes chaotic quickly - too many uncontrollables for serious play.

Acquire has a simple game mechanic that manages to capture the essence of the financial world quite well. Its simplicity makes it easy to teach. However, it is very engaging and involves a lot of strategising to play well. Scalability is on the poor side and it works better with more players; 6 players is the best player count.

The only part My Significant Other and I do not quite like is the gaming components of the 2008 edition. They are unattractive and indeed, feels a little cheap. We have since gone on to purchase the 1999 edition and that really adds to the game experience.

The plastic pieces and the board that holds them, really makes the game so much better. It is the tactile addition that improves the game. The game play is terrific and solidy deserving of the "classic" status that the game has.

Abstract Strategy game where players are building and buying shares in hotels. Money to buy the shares is generated through larger companies merging with smaller companies - and the share holders of the smaller companies get a payout for their shares. The trick is to be the major shareholder in small companies while still holding stock in the larger companies. Most money (cash in hand and value of your share holdings) wins.

I can appreciate its place as a landmark game and the blueprint/inspiration for tile laying games to come, but that's about it. When I see Acquire's rating, I'm baffled. I see a game held up by staunch supporters who love what the game represents to them (either nostalgia or a game ahead of its time -- at the time) and not what the game currently is. 

The allure of Acquire eludes me completely. I think it is an imbalanced, luck-riddled, rich-get-richer, plodding dinosaur. But for some, Acquire is their first kiss -- one of the first "real" games they played that they'll always remember fondly, regardless of the actual details. No matter how much better the kisser might be, and how many better kissers they've made out with, that first kiss still tantalizes the senses and triggers fond memories.

I picked up the 08 Hasbro version in a math trade and the components are every bit as merely adequate as reported... The game itself is enjoyable as you try to get the most out of the tiles you draw and look for those big scores in the mergers... but it goes too long and feels pretty random overall.  Still, a decent game with a lot of the feel of some of the family classics (like monopoly) but a pleasant bit more thinking behind it. Still too mathy for the casual players I game with that would otherwise enjoy it so it was traded away.

A frustrating game about buying and selling  stocks that never really quite work out the way you planned by the time you finally get to take your turn.  It is often nice to be in "control" of mergers when you draw the right tiles, but trying to manipulate stock holding so you'll end up as the majority is another beast altogether.  Lessons I learned from my first play includes, but does not limit to, having the most liquidity doesn't mean the game is won; running out of money is bad, you should always take the opportunity to buy, even if the choices aren't obvious; trading in stocks for another is almost always mandatory towards the end of the game, it could mean the difference between earning 12000 or half of that.  I'm looking forward to try this again.

This rating will probably stay where it is.  A classic, and has virtues in its own right, but nothing that screams, "Hey, this is an outstanding game!"  I do still enjoy playing it from time to time, though. Update: I realized from my last play how cool Acquire is.  Plus it helped that we were playing with the correct rules (before, we had played where you didn't get a stock of the company you found).  Seemed to make a big difference.

Purple Hasbro edition.

Excellent game with few flaws.  I like the tile drawing aspect of the game and coupled with the mergers aspect, It is a favorite of mine.  I will agree with others that the luck aspect of the game can sometime put you far behind, but it playes quickly enough that if it happens, it is still a good game.  I would say, "Buy this game."

I can easily see why this has stood the test of time for 50+ years. Simple rules, engaging gameplay, it's all here.

I'm not sure why this is such a beloved classic.  To me it's playable but not much fun.  Union Pacific scratches a similar itch but is much more satisfying.

Financial simulations shouldn't be this fun and enthralling, should they?  Nearly everyone who has had enough volition to get over its uninspiring concept (unless you're a broker at heart) has discovered the thrill of this superb game.  Though I have seen a player downtrodden from the start, I have only seen such misfortune once.  Play this game.  The biggest downside of it is that you can run yourself out of cash, and have no way to trigger income, but that's mostly in how much risk you choose to toy with in playing the game.

RATING: 8
A fun and fast paced game. Great for involving friends not into deep strategy games, yet still satisfying enough for the avid gamers.

My only knock on this game is the helpless feeling of not being able to go after a player you believe to be in the lead. Players effect one another's positions in the game, but only passively.

RATING: 8
TOO dependent on lucky tiles.  Fun concept, more fun with lots of ppl... but not my style so much.
EDIT:  Recently, our group has been playing this game in 45 min or less.  This makes the game a lot more fun as it goes quickly and if you are unlucky you don't waste more than half an hour.

After 1 Play: Amazing how such an old game plays so well.  Looking forward to future plays.

After 2+ Plays: Playing other games from this era has only increased my wonder at how modern this feels.  It's not a game I request, but maybe I should.

RATING: 7
A fun old game. For being created in 1962 there is a lot of depth in Acquire. For a 2 person game each player has a lot of control over when a hotel chain merges or forms, but with 6 people the tactics are a lot more cloudy. That difficulty in nailing down a plan is appealing to me.

One Piece re-theme. Instead of stocks and companies, you're using money on members of the "Seven Seas", gradually expanding their territories in the Grand Line.
What an amazing game Acquire is. I knew it would be a good game, having lived for 35 years, but I didn't expect it to be this good. Simple yet taxing.

After your playgroup plays this game about say...50 times in a couple months it starts to get old, haha. Really fun game, easy to learn, there is def. a bit of strategy (you have to remember who buys stock in different hotels/companies), but the game is also somewhat dependent on what tiles you draw. Recommended!

The only thing that prevents this from being a 10 is the fact that one can fall completely out of contention very early on.  Otherwise, a great game of strategic investments and stock management with a mix of luck-based tile distribution.

Really good stocks game and a great tool for teaching math. The abstract nature of the tiles and grid though seem to be a turn off for many people.

Our gaming group in Tokyo loves this one.  Sure the tile drawing is random, but it is all the agonizing decisions you make amidst this that make the game fun.

I've got a 1966 3M bookshelf edition and a 1999 Avalon Hill (Hasbro) edition.  The 1966 has been played once and has some spotting and shelfwear but is otherwise in fine shape. The 1999's box shows shelf wear but all of the components (the tiles and building tops) are still in their heat sealed bags.  

I bought the 1999 edition at a show; it's got a high trade value, though, so I'm willing to trade it away if the offer is right.

This is a typical game that starts as a 8 or 9, hits the table a lot, and after a while it loses it's appeal. Still definitely worth your money. It's just _I_ am now in 'phase 2' and find it slightly boring

Classic and elegant economic game. Works well with any number of players. Lot of people find it too abstract tough.

Prototype:

I played the prototype at last year's Discworld UK convention. I don't know how much it has changed but it was like this at the time:

The board is made up of a 4 x 4 grid of reversible tiles, white and black (on and off). Players change the pattern of tiles (3 x 2) to create letters to make up a word.

Players each take a word card, and a hand of 4 cards to use to change the tiles and effect other players. Most cards have a pattern on them that show which tiles to flip (on to off, off to on), some can be played in combination. There are also 'take that' cards you can use to interrupt play (cancelling/discarding cards, wiping the board etc.) The winner is the first to complete their word.

I thought the game was fairly interesting, but not amazing. The main concerns for me were that it was difficult to stop someone else winning and there is sometimes a lot of choice in your turn (combinations of cards to play) - so for players not used to abstracts the turn time (and downtime) can be a bit too long.

I only played it a handful of times, and everyone I played with was learning the game with me, so it could just be an indicator of the learning curve. In this case I would suggest trying it (or waiting for an excellent review) before you make a decision.

Played solo only so far. Wouldn't be in a rush to try with group but may try at some point.

Each turn in Clacks is a puzzle in which you are switching on and off lights to form a pattern representing a letter in a message.  Tiles provide a limited set of options for doing that, as well as moving your enemy, the postmaster, along his track.  Puzzles are in a no win situation with me.  If I can solve them quickly, I deride them as too easy.  If I can't, then frustration sets in.  At least in cooperative mode, Clacks falls into the first category.  Admittedly, the progress of the postmaster allows for hardly a misstep, but on a turn by turn basis this just didn't engage the grey cells enough.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is forgettable.

Great abstract game.  There are rules for co-op, competetive and solo modes in the box.  Has an element of take that in competetive mode and can get quite thinky but definitely fun.

A nice game, a bit more abstract for a 'discworld' game but I still like it.

Going Postal the Boardgame is a neat little puzzle game with two games in a box.

The competitive mode simulates the fight for "Employee of the month": The one who transmits his message the fastest while being hindered by his co-workers is the winner.

The cooperative mode recreates the race between the Clacks Company (sorry for missing the correct term in english) and the postal office of Ankh-Morpork. Pretty tough race... pretty tough.

The components and the artwork are nice, the gameplay is simple but quite brain burning.
Cool little puzzle.

Pattern puzzle abstract, but much too easy. I think we managed to accomplish the pattern almost every single turn.

RATING: 7
Interesting game that make you plan several turns ahead while hoping that opposing players don't hinder you too much.

Solo game plays quickly and is fun while challenging (especially on the harder difficulty).

Interesting game, bit heavy on the brain, not one to try to play after a drink or two, but still fun. Best waiting until it's your turn before trying to work out what to do, so no pint trying to think ahead as the board changes so much

I haven't tried the cooperative game since we were just taught the competitve version and that was an annoying abstract game on which the theme was entirely wasted.

A really cool game for people who like to excercise their spatial intelligence. Quality components and two different game modes - coop and competitive in one box. Want it :-)

We played the prototype at Essen 2014. Quite a nice puzzle game, building the pattern required with action points and score. Downtime is the problem with this game. It is difficult to plan ahead as the board will be changed by the previous player. Perhaps experience helps to bring down the downtime.

Ultimately disppointing. Despite the rich integration of theme and a delightful game presentation, there is way too much useless downtime in this game, allied with the futility of trying to advance plan. Chaotic games can be good (see Artus for one of the best examples), but there is just too little control in Clacks. You may as well spend the time spent between turns playing something else.

Probably the upper cusp of abstract strategy games that I'm willing to play...pretty thinky in some spots. I enjoyed the cooperative version of the game much more than the competitive.  All in all, though, a neat design!

Provisional rating, one play. I like co-op games, but I like them to tell a story, and to involve a wider range of actions and decisions than did Clacks. We chose difficult mode, but it was still too easy.

I like that this can be played cooperatively or solitaire. The Discworld theme is a plus, but it's only a thin veneer; the game is essentially abstract.

This is very nice one about Disk World! (but IMO Ankh-Morpork is still better, and theme is definitely not so strong) ;) 

Must play with time limit though...

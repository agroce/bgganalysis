A very cool and beautiful game. It needs to be played with at least three, preferably four or five. A number of different games can be played with the pieces, and it would be easy to create your own. I'm glad I finally got a copy of this!

This is a great game of dexterity, screwage, and laughs.  It's made great by the fact that you choose what your opponent has to place, so you're always looking at the stacks of the other players and finding that one piece that's going to screw not only the person to your left, but to his left, and so on.

It's a lot of fun, and it's one of the few games in my collection where I have taken videos of play in progress.

2016-06-23 (rating 6):

I like [gameid=2452] more. It is simpler and shorter. Maybe if the game modes were better then who knows? But as it is now I find Bausack less interesting.

2010-08-26 (rating 8):

More an entertainment than a game but still very enjoyable. Especially with non-playing friends.

I feel that the gaming modes are not made well but while playing it doesn't matter that much since its not as much about winning as it is about enjoyment.

Sac Noir version. Probably a problem with most dexterity games but the whole "was it during your turn it fell down or my turn" is a PITA.

RATING: 9
48 this is SO awesome. We don't really play by the rules. We play where, on a players turn, they pick a number of pieces equal to the number of players in the game, then, starting with the player on their left, everyone picks a piece to stack, leaving the last one for the player who picked them all. AWESOME FUN for EVERYONE! added bandu as well.

Smashing game.  What's particularly nice is that the author gives you various sets of rules to use.  I find that the ten bean bidding one (knock out) is maybe the best, but some of the others are great, too.  Maybe sometimes it can go on a little long, but some variants quicken it up.

Have made some sculptures from it that look as if they're from Salvador Dali's garden.  A super looking game!

A game where you stack random abstract shapes with the objective of not being the one to topple the pile. Every time someone topples it with a piece you hand them or you place it on the pile when they hand it back to you, you score a point. First person to three points wins. Lots of fun.

Love the balancing aspect, love the odd shaped tiles, hate the game mechanic of the auction, just feels bland/broken and some games can be great while others fall flat due to this rather than anything else, unsure how to fix it though.

Oh, I like this game!  Take a simple stacking game and add a ruleset that forces lots of player interaction through auctions.  Brutal, brutal game!  It keeps everyone pretty close together, even though it has player elimination.  Don't know why it took so long for me to pick this up.  Looking forward to trying the other variants!

+ Having varied rule-sets allows for lots of replayability; The pieces are very well thought out which allows for great creativity.
- Just a few of the pieces aren't cut exactly right, which really stands out when compared to the rest of the excellent-quality blocks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I was not too impressed with Bandu's presentation.  It looks like random wooden blocks from other games and toys thrown together, as if the manufacturer was left with odd parts and figured out a way to package and sell them (Bausack looks like a nicer version).  It just struck me as a cheap way to squeeze money out of people silly enough to pay for it.  The gameplay is okay, but I am not much of a dexterity game fan, and the whole "give someone a junky piece" coupled with an underdeveloped bidding mechanic did not appeal to me.  That said, it's better than not playing any game at all.

Reverse Jenga.  You and your opponents take turns picking pieces for each other to stack on top of their towers, and eventually one falls over and everyone cheers.  A lot more fun than Bamboleo, but a lot less fun than many other games.  There is a "No Thanks" element of the game where you can put a bean in the middle to not take a piece, and you can run other players out of beans by auctioning up a piece that doesn't work for their towers, and wait til it comes back to you and take it for a negative one bean delta across your opponents.

Pros
- Fun to build stuff
- You'll probably take a picture of your structure
- You get a sense of ownership for what you build
- There are a lot of blocks which makes it different and fun
- Customize the game to however you want to play it

Cons
- Bidding for pieces adds an unnecessary layer to a fun dexterity game 
- Look up variations of the game where you don't have to bid

Tenative rating after one play.  This is a game with 2 key parts.  The bidding component which raises tensions and the building component which forces you to visualize how pieces go together.  There is a lot of indirect competition here as you select pieces which will be the least appetizing to other players.  There is an emphasis on how to visualize objects and put the pieces together in your head.  This game is very scalable.  My first game was with 6 players.

Have tried this game once, and I have to place it solely at 5. It's a fun game, but I feel that after two or three more plays I'd get really tired of it.

The bidding function is an interesting one, but I think rather than seeing the beans go to the bank, I'd like to see them passed around the table - that is, when you put a piece up for auction, you're not allowed to bid on it, but everyone's "bets" come to you. That would add a little more strategy to the game, and likely make it a bit more edgy.

Bandu is a classic party game that's always fun to play, if not a bit too lengthy. The game is different enough that most people will not quickly get tired of it if played in moderation. See my review for more information, and for more ideas of "found objects" that we use for additional pieces.

I own the Milton Bradley Bandu version of this offering.  I believe I received it as a gift in my college years, but I don't have much memory of its origin in my collection.  For whatever reason, when this game hits the table, no one wants to take it seriously.  They don't try, they don't plan ahead, and some chucklehead usually bumps the table on purpose.  I don't know why this is. Because of the previous, this game gets very little play time.  Too bad. Contains all 54 wooden pieces in excellent condition.  There are no bidding beans present as well as no original rule set.  Box shows shelf wear and some tape damage near the top.

I now only have the Bandu edition, after trading off my Sac Noir edition.

I love the plastic beans in the Bandu edition rather than the real ones in Sac Noir.  And there's enough of a variety of pieces in Bandu, even though there's less than in Bausack or Sac Noir.

The different kinds of pieces (even the round ones are not impossible to work with, since they have bottoms that can sit on a flat surface and some of them are hollow so you can hang them on pointy shapes) and the bidding (for getting a piece, or usually in our group, *against* getting a piece) make this dexterity game involve both thought and dexterity.

Not so much a game as a set of stacking pieces for a whole number of dexterity games (some with an auction element).

From the very nice Dwayne (okiedokie). Won it on his giveaway draw on this geeklist http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/20639
Played with the family. It was very well recieved and it's really a very good party game. The game get really tense when you play, and even my daughter 6yo, who isn't a gamer liked it a lot.
Will for sure buy the Sack Noir

sac noir: fun to build the towers.  not so fun to play with the beans.  not so fun for the first person who's tower falls over and they have to sit it out for the rest of the game.  combine it with Blockhead to get more starting pieces.  A decent game, but honestly not worth the money.

We sometimes call it "reverse Jenga". It's since been renamed "Bandu" in North America because, well, let's not get anatomical. My wife and I quite enjoy knocking things over in this game. The components tell the whole story and they're fantastic; this is just sheer balancing frustration and fun.

Fantastically crafted pieces, and this game is a lot of fun.  I'm not entirely crazy about the "games" they list in the instructions though -- the ones we have tried seem a little clumsy with the bidding for pieces, or rejecting pieces.  I recall that it was far more advantageous to just offload difficult pieces off on other people.  Rules could use some tweaking.

Nov 2010:  played the co-op version where everyone is adding to the same castle.   Much more fun IMO than the basic game with the gems.

I would argue that Bausack is a necessary game for virtually any collection. It is playable with almost any group of people, the dexterity element is exciting, and the auctions can be used as a gateway to games like [Gameid=12] and [Gameid=118].

RATING: 6.5
Not quite as much fun as it should be for some reason but reasonably entertaining all the same. 

On further play and the same reaction, I think the reason is that the advanced game rewards gamesmanship - i.e. mostly avoiding building - much more than building ability.  I think it would be better the other way round and would like to find a suitable rules fix for the next time we play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of fun!  Essentially, you want to be the last player with a structure still standing, but the real twist here is that every piece must be bid on; either to refuse the piece or to use the piece.  So, you never have complete control over what pieces you'll have to add to your structure.  The game is almost as much about managing your beans (which are the bidding currency) as it is about the dexterity stacking element.

The bidding beans make this one a lot more interesting than other games of its kind.  I much prefer Bandu to Bausack.  Bandu gets an 8, Bausack gets a 6.

It's an interesting game. The towers look cool as you build them. We only enjoyed versions of the game without negative auctions. However, we don't feel any pull to play again. The game lacks excitement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good blend of dexterity and strategy. Knowing how to spend your beans wisely is just as important as a steady hand. Oh and there's PLENTY of opportunities to screw over your opponents. I'm completely in love with the pieces in this game... and so was everyone else who saw them. They're beautiful and all the little shapes are just so cool, and you can make some really interesting towers with them. My one complaint with this game is the rules are a bit wonky... I don't see how people make all these awesome high towers, as if you play competitively things will stay small and end pretty fast.

I have the Sac Noir edition and the pieces are FANTASTIC! And evil. Very, very evil.

Several different games, all based on building and requiring some planning and a steady hand. Great fun seeing others having to build with the less stable shapes. Oh, and don't listen to Jon Power if he tells you to start your construction on the sloping surface of a ramp "because it's much more solid"!

The pieces included with this set are hilarious.  The games of this that I've played used a Geschenkt-like rules variant that went pretty well--it added a little bidding strategy to the dexterity.  (Is this an official or unofficial variant, and did Alex make the rules up on the spot?)  The wooden bits are also quite versatile since they're not general enough to be boring (like Jenga) and not specific enough that only one game can be played with them (Hamsterrolle).

This is very often my go-to game, when I face a rather inhomogeneous group asking me to play something. Language independent, fit old and young gamers - and everyone loves to hold this different wooden blocks in the hand. And with the auction rules, you can easily call it jenga for gamers.

The best steady hand dexterity game I`ve come across. Everybody enjoys the stacking phase and the tension that builds for each piece placed. We play with the variant that each turn every player picks out one of the same coloured pieces (red or white) and then we use a simple dice roll to decide who gets first pick of the chosen pieces. This little randomness can lead to lots of fun. 
When a player thinks he`s smart by taking a devious
and difficult piece and then rolls lowest on the dice and has to stack it himself. Ha-Ha you lose sucker. Always on the lookout for varied pieces to add to the game.

This is a delightful game, which combines building a little tower with, well, a game.  There is a large element of trying to build your tower so it can accommodate some perverse piece that your opponents' towers cannot, so that you can force them to pay not to have to place it.  The pieces are all designed so that they look like they might almost fit together nicely, but very few of them do.  Still, some quite remarkable structures are possible.

UPDATE.  Much much better (and faster) with the simple rule: place one or pass one.  The ability to cover up your "danger zones" dramatically improves the experience.  The clatter of bricks is loud (so I was told at 11pm).  UPGRADE.  I love the way someone can hand you the meanest piece in the world and then offer sincere advice on how best to place it.  UPDATE.  Just bought the 25yr edition and it is just plain gorgeous.  UPDATE.  New variant, Defense/Offense.  The starting player for the round, chooses a piece to put on their tower (defense) and each player clockwise does the same.  Next, the starting player for the round passes one piece clockwise which their opponent must play (offense), and each player clockwise does the same.  Finally, pass the start player token clockwise and repeat.

SOLD IT!

Saw this one being played at a convention. I somewhat enjoy dexterity games, and wanted to give this a try being intrigued by the auction mechanic. After having played it, I do enjoy the light stacking game, but found the auction mechanic a bit goofy... adding ANY piece to your tower can only have negative effects, so why ever put up a 'keep to use' auction? At the very worse you would take an ideal building piece and do a 'bid to avoid' auction... worse case it comes to you.

Will try again with alternate rules in forums.

An amusing and fun dexterity game with a mildly interesting bidding mechanic.  Excellent physical quality -- each player's tower is a work of art.  Good family fun, as kids can play on a level field with adults.  Also a good gateway game, as it never fails to get attention at the cafe, laundromat, train station, etc.

I have one complete set and one almost complete set (3 pieces missing) of Bandu.  About half of the pieces are dyed plum and the other half are dyed a dark shade of tangerine (almost red). I also have a Bausack kit dyed black.

Bandu version. I play the "draw a piece and stack it" fashion. Would love to get another copy to get a little more variety of pieces coming out. Hopefully I have resolved the piece variety issue by using two almost complete sets in one big bag. Problems seem to have been resolved, it's a classic game with many different ways to play.

Sac Noir edition.  This is a fun game.  I like that there are so many games you can choose to play.  It will keep this interesting for a while.

I believe someone described Bausack as immortal.  I can really think of no better description.  It's simply a classic that I will have forever.  Totally worth the price.  Between this and crokinole I can actually have as much fun with nongamers as I do gamers.  I play baukette (everyone chooses a row of 12 or so) almost exclusively, but sometimes I play the "Canadian variant" posted somewhere here on the Geek when I don't know how much time we have.  I've never been able to get the auction variants to work that well.  They tend to benefit particular players in seating order unfairly.

[Bandu] The worst building game I have played yet.  I even like Jenga better.  We played it once all the way through, and all of us had built a stack, used up all the pieces, and we were just standing there twiddling our thumbs.  Very unsatisfying.  Maybe we have to play with less that 6 people.  Or do it with our eyes closed.  The bidding process was actually slow and agonizing... maybe because it was out first time.  Glad it only cost me $.50.

One of my favourite dexterity games. For years after playing a game of Jenga, we'd spend some time after just building weird structures from its ruins. This pretty much is that, with a very smart bidding/reject system works to keep things interesting. Fun game aside, it's such a pretty activity to take part in as well!  I love the aesthetics.  Fortunately, I love the game too.

Interesting twist on a stacking dexterity game, in that you bid for the pieces you want. It's a once around auction, and if no one bids, the player who picked it must use it.

You can try to be the last one standing, or you can try to have the most pieces in your stack. Only played at 4p, and I think that may be it's best.

I have the Bandu edition.  I wanted to like it more, but it may have been the group I played with, or the fact we only played once,, or maybe we got a rule wrong.  While the careful bidding for pieces was great, we never really got to the outrageous balancing situations I was hoping for.  Most everyone found a way to build very low and put a lot of pieces on their base block.   Maybe there should be a limit on how many blocks can touch the base block?

A beautiful dexterity game with a strategic bidding element. Bausack is a relaxing and enjoyable game as long as it moves at an andante tempo rather than an adagio.  Players can enjoy watching (and rooting for or against) each other's creations even when they're not physically involved in the action.

A wickedly insane exercise in sadomasochism. A fine dexterity game of stacking wooden pieces, consisting of shapes from the fairly benign blocks to the "you've got to be kidding" category. A fun party game which can be enjoyed through participation and/or vicariously, as players struggle to stack these pieces higher and higher without toppling them over. Rating: "7".

A stacking game but one which has many variations on how to play.  Several variants allow each player to have their own tower which improves things a lot over several similar games.  Bidding for pieces is another option that adds quite a bit of tactics on top of the main skill of having steady hands, but may make the game too fiddly for some.

Who doesn't love the child-like joy of building with wooden bricks? Very much a game for steady hands, and the longer it goes on the better it gets. The included rules aren't particularly inspiring, but it's easy to invent your own variant. The auction-based versions of the game are slightly problematic as 10 beans per player isn't enough for meaningful bidding throughout the game, I usually run out long before the end.

No matter how old one is, playing with wooden blocks is still fun, and this provides a box full of different types to play with.

I had not been able to find this game since I played it in high school, in part because I forgot the name. Loved it though!.  SOOO much better than Jenga! Why start with a tower when you can start from nothing and build up? Why include unnecessary startup time? And, what happens if you know you can't place that next piece? This games solves both of those Jenga problems!

Included game variants are mediocre at best. Bidding for pieces simply delays the actual fun part of the game.

Our house rules: Decide whether victory will be by tallest structure at any point or tallest structure at end. Can optionally be played as a team game. Take turns selecting and placing one piece. Optionally limit the number of rounds (and therefore pieces to each person's tower). Optionally enforce that you have to include a specified ratio or quantity of the dark blocks.

Seems so simple yet is extremely intense!  What a good game for a group of friends to play.  Quick to learn.  Much more than a simple stacking game.  Each piece has a counterpart which stacks well with it.  Red pieces are a bit slippery (challenging) to stack together.  Auction mechanic is tonnes of fun.  Many rules variants to give the game longevity.  Worth buying.

Best variant:
On your turn you choose a block and offer it to another player. They then have 2 choices;
%u2022 Place the block you have offered.  Throw away a bean and give it you back, in which case you have to place it.

4beans. (7-8players) / 6 beans (4players)
possibly remove horrible pieces.

Jenga with some extra flavor. The game is much better when played with one of the below variants:

"Increasing Auction": When a player holds a "To Refuse" auction, the amount need to bid to refuse the piece goes up by one each time. Players should start with some extra chips to compensate.

"Tallest Tower": Whenever a player places a piece in their tower that increases its height, measure and record the new height. The player who managed to build the tallest tower during the game wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Loads of fun, but definitely requires a steady hand.  The pieces are very attractive and look great when put together, which makes this a lot more than reverse Jenga.  I'm not quite sure yet which variant is the best - I'll have to do some further experimentation.

This seemingly hasn't wowed anyone yet; people will laugh at some impossible placement or tumbling tower but then it's please let us play a real game now. I'm not sure if this is simply due to a general lack of interest in dexterity games that the auction layer fails to overcome. Given another opportunity I'd like to try a different variant from the "knockout" game. Note: if you do play "knockout" with the 2007 edition rules, give everyone a starting block even though it says not to.

Thrifted on 5/2 2013 and 9/9 2017.

I'm not sure about the rules that come with the game, but if you just play it as a stacking game (taking turns adding a piece) then it's brilliant already. The shapes have been really well designed, typically when you think that it has become impossible to add any more pieces to the tower, several more can be added.

Played both Hamsterrolle and Bausack on the same day. Although Hamsterrolle had the flashier components – who doesn’t want to take a giant hamster wheel for a spin? – Bausack won my heart in this game category. Hamsterrolle just seemed one dimensional – place a piece and don’t make things fall – while Bausack had more to it, namely a really interesting auction phase for pieces each round. Lots of evil auctioning all around to mess with everyone.

RATING: 6.5
"Use the Canadian variant posted to BGG... when it's your turn you pick a piece to add to the one central tower. The player next to you has to place that piece, or give it back to you for you to place. If they try to place the piece and knock something over, you get a point. If they hand it back to you, and you succeed at placing the piece, you get a point. This creates this fantastic tension where you want to pick something difficult but not something you don't think you have a chance at placing."

Fun strategy game.  The pieces are fun to play with and think about.  However, it can get frustrating when a newbie is making it easy for someone.  Try sitting to the right of the most advanced player.
MODIFIED RULES TO FIX THE TURN ORDER ISSUE:  You can pass a piece to any player instead of just the player to your left.  They can pass to any other player including the player who gave it to them.  The person who takes the piece goes next.  If their tower falls while attempting to place the piece, the last player to place a piece goes next.  To bid auctions remain clockwise.

This is just plain fun, with a neat bidding mechanic and many more layers than something like Jenga.

Player elimination?!  In a dexterity game?  And analysis paralysis prone, to boot.  When the blocks fall, the game should be over.  Also, there are a ton of variants, so it seems the base rules are not adequate.

I'm going to try base Bandu rules with sudden death.  Game over when the first player loses.  The player with the tallest tower at that point wins.  That might just raise my rating.  The blocks are an '8', if they only had some decent rules...

Bandu has 48 playable pieces, Bausack has 70 (2 colors, with more game variants), and Sack Noire has about 100.

There's an impressive amount of wood in this box. At first I wasn't sure what I thought of the unfinished pieces (the red ones look so much nicer), but in play they offer a bit of extra traction that can prove handy. The insert and sacks are nicely made.

Building Chain game: This was fun, and it appeared to be fun even for the folks who got eliminated -- just watching people build is enjoyable. Also enjoyable is the palpable tension, which was a bit of surprise given how light this game is. This version was a good way to introduce the pieces and get a feel for the game.

Shared Tower Game: Totally different dynamic. It's all about dick moves and timing them, making the tower just the right amount of godawful and not fucking yourself over in the process.

Good with variants -- Knock-out with round-robin auctions, and the No Thanks! variant.  Rules as written suck and are full of typos, which is really impressive for an nth reprint.
Currently playing with a modified No Thanks! variant: start with standard base; 7 gems per player; the player that takes the piece and the gems auctions off a piece of their choice and next player starts the bid.

Beginners and more experienced players alike are usually thrilled and surprised by the physics-deying creations on the table. Can be played with several different rules variants, the best of which rewards auctioning tactics as well as a steady hand for building. Fun, very replayable and downright tense at the end when the final two towers are teetering on the edge of collapse.

RATING: 4
Game in a Nutshell: Each player bids on and stacks odd shaped doodads with the goal of having the last structure standing.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: Forget boring old blocks and sticks, this has some of the coolest pieces of any dexterity game out there! It's fun that each player has their own creation to work on that grows in very different ways. There's a tension in stacking games that just can't be matched by any other mechanic.

Cons: Kind of a weird "it's more fun to lose" dynamic that if you want to win, it's often best to pass on bids and do very little stacking. It's way more fun to take that crazy piece and figure out how to incorporate into your structure even if it does contribute to a quicker demise. Really, the fun and excitement of the game is the stacking while any other rules just seem to detract from and prolong the experience.

Other: I'm sure there's got to be a variant out there that would bring a more balanced spirit to the game. I don't think I'll play by the box rules again. I've only played with a thrifted copy which was missing a number of pieces, but it worked great as it was... But for these reasons I've held off rating the game for now. Oh, and you'll want a very steady table.

Best Use: Certainly the most ornamental of stacking games.

Not so much a game as it is an art form. It takes the basic concept of a block-stacking game to the next level by adding some ridiculously precarious shapes. In the version where all players build on a single tower, you can try to make it really hard for the next player by using one of the most precarious pieces, but often these are not so easy to add to the tower for you either.

In the version where everybody has their own tower, you can exercise your independent creativity to build a masterpiece of modern style, or try to engineer a towering but sturdy skyscraper.

Just always a blast, and most everyone enjoys it.

A simple variant: each player builds their own tower. Take turns picking any unused piece and adding it to your tower. Last tower standing wins (or tallest in the event that all pieces are used). We once got down to two pieces left...

If using the standard game, we think it's best not to allow "refusal" auctions until everyone has at least one piece. Otherwise, someone might be faced with a crippling decision at the very beginning of the game: use a bizarre piece as their base or give up most of their beans.

In this dexterity game you have to place very oddly shaped pieces to build a tall tower.  You lose when you knock over the tower.

There are several variations included in the game.  One of these has a bidding component where you bid NOT to use some of the harder, more ridiculously shaped pieces.  

This dexterity game makes a nice break from other types of games.

While I like dexterity/balancing games, I tend to enjoy Bandu less. For balancing games, the fun comes from trying to add things to the stack, that is the key fun component. The optimal strategy in Bandu is to try and pass off complex pieces to others so you are trying to not have to add things to your stack. It just kind of defeats the purpose of playing a balancing game in my opinion.

Everybody should have at least one dexterity game in their collection.  The ridiculous variety of block shapes and the added strategy of the bidding options make this one my favourite so far.  It's like Jenga in reverse on steroids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a dexterity game with quite funky shaped components. Most pieces are very different from each other and trying to balance them can be quite tricky. Everything must be built onto (usually too small) base piece so it doesn't take too many pieces for the game to get exciting. Bausack is a good game with 4 and 5 players although with 5 it can be a long while to wait for other players if you drop out too early. But with more players it's more fun. 

I have liked most variations of the game. Perhaps the best is one where you bid (to either build or to not build) for pieces. In that variation the game really starts after everyone is very low on beans and your right hand player can just give you a piece to be placed into your structure. Usually they don't fit too well..

a) not the massive range of piece shapes I had hoped for.
b) not as massively fun as I had anticipated. Elimination mechanic really doesn't help.
c) less strategy, although it's up to us to find the right rules set.

Still a great Christmas game for all that.

Great take on the dexterity game, with a neat auction element. The game has two distinct phases--the beginning where there are beans flying everywhere, and the endgame where everyone is at the mercy of the person to his right. Very fun game.

This is probably my current favorite dexterity game.  This case you get to control the pieces, take some from others' supply, and have many options to build something unique.  It provides tension and intrigue better than most dexterity games.

Like most dexterity games, it's not as high based on skill of players and sturdiness of the table.  Hard to play with kids and cats in the area.

RATING: 8
Probably the best dexterity game there is, although the beans were weird. But oh well, you have to pay with something and the beans fit into theme so, no harm done..

For example compared to the Villa Paletti, definitely best thing is that everyone has their own tower. So if a player screws, the game isn't done yet, only the player.
The building parts are scary sometimes. I have no idea how some of them fit anywhere. But that's one of the best parts in this game: play to find out and lose trying.

My fate was a failed attempt to guess how slippery some parts can be. ^^;
With a bit of luck and steady hands, you can build very imaginative structures - and get ready for a collapse!

Great building party game. Although at first the pieces seem like they're never going to match, creative players will discover their secrets. If played with the right people the game is very fun and intense as you keep hoping your tower won't collapse and keep being amazed how you still managed to add a new piece when it seemed impossible. Got it for my birthday - a game that's just 2 years younger than me. The bidding variants take a bit more time and are recommended with more of a gamer crowd.

Appealing dexterity game involving building towers out of odd-shaped wooden blocks. There are various ways to play to suit different numbers of players.

The pieces are very nice, and it looks like quite a bit of thought has gone into the shapes so that there are many clever ways to stack & interlock them during building.

RATING: 6.5
A very unique game, sort of the kind of game you play anyway trying to stack spoons and salt shakers at dinner time.  We've even played this game but with common household objects.  I like it, but we usually do our own house rules because the whole bean bidding thing has never really made much sense to me (although I haven't given it much effort).  Bottom line: never take on the big round stuff.  Avoid hard pieces early in the game and you'll win, because you always get players that try the play it all and conserve beans approach... this never works, and you can always outlast them.

Unusual dexterity game in which you bid on a piece for it's stability worth when adding to an unstable construction. The thing is that it is a game you need to play often to get the experience as to how stable a piece is. My problem is that I never felt inclined to play many games. Still more substantial than Jenga.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Better with more people.  Need to have more bidding pieces to make the game more meaningful.  I like the fact that you can choose how the piece can either be a bid to not take or bid to take.  Might become better if there's some kind of No Thanks style bidding system in play for a set of pieces.

We played the Canadian variant posted to BGG and had a fantastic time. The base game comes with a number of different games you can play, but the essence of how we did it was, when it's your turn you pick a piece to add to the one central tower. The player next to you has to place that piece, or give it back to you for you to place. If they try to place the piece and knock something over, you get a point. If they hand it back to you, and you succeed at placing the piece, you get a point. This creates this fantastic tension where you want to pick something difficult but not something you don't think you have a chance at placing. This variant really ignited an excitement for this game that we didn't have after playing the first ruleset in the base game book.

That dirt-cheap classic Blockhead is actually better than this. Bausack as way too many “impossible” pieces such as cylinders that have one end cut on an angle. It’s more fun to present your opponent a structure that’s *almost* impossible to make higher than one that’s *totally* impossible.

Pros:
1. Plays quickly.
2. Interesting dexterity game with some fun shapes.
3. A fun pass mechanic that allows you some flexibility on what you're going to stack.

Cons:
1. After a few plays it loses the novelty fairly fast.
2. Gets boring fast.

Summary: Dexterity game with a very limited shelf life. It's fairly expensive for just being a bunch of random wood pieces. There are much much better dexterity games out there.

I'm still not sure how I feel about the auction rules for this game, and I love auction games. We have just been playing 2-player games and we just see who lasts the longest with a few simple rules. You can only have one base piece at the bottom. You also get three of the jenga stye blocks to use whenever you choose, this does count as a turn(one piece per turn). You have to switch back and forth between white and red pieces. This has made for some really good games and some awesome looking structures, before they fall of course.

We might try to add a few animals from Animal Upon Animal to create some kind of unique variant.

So many different variants but the one I've had most success with so far is 'No Thanks' bidding where you have to play a chip to decline the next tile (or just take it). This has seen us play games where we get through just about every block in the box.

It is really entertaining to build the towers and always surprising to watch people achieve the seemingly impossible by adding yet another block to their already precarious tower.

I need to play some more "tallest tower" games as we've generally just played "last man standing" games so far.

Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction.

Some versions of this game are weak, but the good ones are quite good.  I'm rating the game based on my favorite versions.

One of my favorites: the lead player picks N+1 pieces, then they are drafted starting with that player.  A player may pay 1 of their 3 beans to decline to use a piece they picked; return it to the supply.

I've also played a simpler version with my kids, where one person is the builder, and everyone else takes turns giving them pieces to use.  Your goal is to give them the pieces that makes their tower fall.

Stack irregular pieces until your sculpture collapses: that makes it a silly party game like Jenga or something.  (Plus it requires a VERY stable table, and suffers from the problem all such games have, of what if your tower falls down but it's not really your fault?)

Auction mechanism for bidding on useful pieces or paying to avoid difficult useless pieces: that makes it a Eurogame wannabe.

So it's a strange hybrid that was amusing once just to see what it was like, but I feel no compulsion to play it again.

Jenga for grownups! Heard a few interviews with the lady who made Jenga, and I must say she comes across as a twit--calling herself the first co-op game designer ever, praising all of her many dubious designs, and stating that nothing new in gaming has happened in a long time...I don't think she's ever come here, or played a game made after 1988...

this one trashes Jenga then closes the lid--so many lovely ways to play, the no thanks variant, stack em high, or the basic one with lines of blocks, one per player, to restrict choice. Is like a block game development kit, really. My fam loves it. Watching others play is almost as fun as playing yourself.

Picked up in good condition from Goodwill. Missing one wooden piece, but doesn't really affect gameplay.  Very fun and challenging dexterity game with an interesting bidding mechanism that can determine how well you do.   Great for the family but also can work with gamers who like some strategy mixed in with dexterity.

Got "Sac Noir" for the extra pieces. Bit of remorse on this one, but I guess I should have known better. I'd prefer the unpainted Bausack bits - not a fan of the black and red colour scheme...and the bag. The font on the bag brings back bad memories of early eighties fashion...shudder. Papa definitely needs a brand new bag. And the beans...must...go. An expensively cheap looking game. Sigh.

Own both Bandu and Bausack, but I actually prefer Bandu for the simple reason that there are less pieces and options in Bandu.  I feel it is better balanced that way. It's my favorite dexterity game so far, and I love to see "impossible" towers being built by everyone!

I am definitely not into dexterity games but this is something pretty exceptional. I particularly like the aesthetic aspect and the fact that it is very flexible- you can come with as many rule sets for it as you like. It is one of the games I keep for special events when non-gamers want to try something and this has proven many times to be a success with them. It made us laugh much more than other more successful so-called "fun" games out there and many times we stood admiring the structures created. Very recommended.

Nekem rögtön a Jenga jutott róla eszembe. Persze annál több. Különböző fa elemeket kell egymásra raknunk különböző szabályok alapján. 42 normál könnyű elem és 24 nehéz érdekes, csúszós elem van, amik közül választhatunk. Minél magasabb torony, minél több elemű és különböző licites játékváltozatok vannak. Tipikus ügyességi játék, amivel el lehet lenni bárkivel, de nagyon nem az én világom.

Bausack has the better rules and bits, Bandu is more readily available and cheaper.  You can play Bausack with Bandu and your game won't suffer.  Quite a bit of fun.

Sac Noir is very good, the pieces are downright evil and everyone gets more beans, but the game tends to go on far longer that Bandu (perhaps too long), I think that there should be a happy medium.  I'm thinking of playing with 7 beans.

I own Bandu, and have played Sac Noir.  This is a great game to have in your collection to entertain gamers and nongamers.  I've never played a boring game of Bandu, as it's fun to watch others assemble their towers, cringing as the wobble starts, etc.  There are two variants I like:  in Bausack where you lay out 3 columns of pieces, and each player takes one of the 3 top pieces on their turn, or in Bandu, where you either place a piece or hand one to the LH player.  In the second instance, I prefer "Gentleman's Rules", in which you always give a piece that the player 'could' place, if he was very careful.  Good times.

RATING: 6
It's a stacking game. There are pieces of various irregular shapes and sizes. There are several rulesets included. One version is this: everyone gets 10? beans. On your turn, you pick a piece to auction off: either to take (high bidder pays and gets it) or to avoid (pay to pass; sort of like High Society's bad-card auctions). If you get the piece you must add it to the structure you've already built (1st piece taken will form the foundation; later pieces added on top of that). If your structure falls, you're knocked out. Last player still in wins!

It's a pretty fun dexterity game. The bidding/auctioning adds a strategic element to the game, but it also makes the game take a little long for me -- I think I prefer Tier auf Tier!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Reverse Jenga with oddly-shaped blocks. More of a game system than a game, it comes with 5+ variants -- build a single tower (make the person after you fail), build separate towers (tallest wins, last one standing wins, first with three red blocks wins); sometimes you draft pieces, or auction pieces, or give pieces to other players.

We found that most of the auction games didn't work, but that was a function of players and player order. With a different crowd I could see some surprisingly strategic gameplay. 

We found that the most successful were simple variants where players take turns drawing a piece from the pool and adding it to a tower. The single-tower version is fun but short. I preferred separate towers, either going for height (no recycling of pieces when a player is eliminated) or last man standing (with recycling).

I bought this game to play with the sort of friends who like to get drunk and build towers out of empty cans and bottles: in that context it works spectacularly well.

This game is a nice change of pace from more traditional board games.  I tend to like dexterity-based games and this one is pretty fun while still retaining some strategy with the bidding system.  The only minor gripe I have is I don't think there are enough "difficult" pieces in the game.  Most of the pieces seem pretty easy to stack.  Also, it seems that having the max # of players could be a problem with the pieces running out, but I don't know that for sure.  Still a good game.

I play it like this: On your turn, take one piece for yourself to stabilise. Then select as many pieces as there are players. The next player chooses one, then the next, and finally you get the worst piece of the selection. Then play passes to the left. Works really well. The stabilisation gives you a chance, meaning you get higher and more epic towers.

Oh, what a crushing disapointment. I'd been looking forward to playing this for years having seen it being built from afar on a number of occasions. 

Unfortunately, the bidding mechanic is a little underbaked and the game just doesn't deliver the laughs that Animal upon Animal does.

The first two games (as listed in the rulebook) are also far too long, even with a misplayed rule where the base could only be one piece instead of as many as the player chooses (which would surely only make the game longer).

First... Is it worth the price ($70+)? I'd have to say yes. It's easy to pull out and explain. The different games are good and everyone seems to like it. What makes this the best stacking dex game is that you have your own tower. So someone actually wins, not just a single loser or some way to declare a winner that doesn't feel right.

Have tried a bidding system like Traumfabrik, which solves the problem I had where people bid themselves out of tokens long before the game is over.

Sac Noir--Like most dexterity games, it is more of a social activity than a game.  There is a very minimal amount of strategy, but it is mostly an enjoyable time-killer.

Einfach die Klötzchen auf dem Tisch ausschütten, ein Teil nehmen und anfangen zubauen. Jeder ist sofort im Spiel drin und begeistert, Bausack hat bisher jedem mit dem ich es gespielt habe ziemlich gut gefallen, wobei wir eigentlich immer die Variante spielen, das Reihum jeder ein Teil in den Turm verbauen muss, und wenn der Turm fällt bekommt der vorherige Spieler einen Punkt und bei fünf Punkten ist das Spiel vorbei

I have young nephews and nieces: I enjoy playing with their building blocks (both with them, and on my own). Bandu  gives me that pleasure in creating something physical, with a more inspiring range of blocks than in most children's sets. Moreover, it also gives two mischievous pleasures: forcing your playing partners to take pieces they'd rather not, and the pleasure of watching (or indeed making) things fall apart.

This from my post on funagain:

I've played Bausack which is essentially the same game as Bausack: Sac Noir, but the Sac Noir edition has extra pieces. I really enjoy this game for a few reasons:

People instantly 'get' the game. Don't let your tower topple is the general gist of it.
Deeper strategy than at first appearance.
There is an element of hope for almost every play. For example, I have landed and seen pieces landed on towers that I thought were for sure going to topple. It is at that moment - after you land it - when you feel a major rush of fun.
The game generally makes you root for everyone. I play a lot of games and am pretty competitive, however I find myself rooting for the guy I just gave an evil piece to.
I've played Villa Paletti and Jenga. This game takes the cake for build/stacking type games. I'm anxious to try out more like this.

nice party/dexterity game with some tactical control to it.  but yeah, it's just an assortment of wood pieces from the hobby shop with some beans as generic counters to keep track of refusals.

King of the stacking games!  Base rules are kind of boring.  Much better with any of the many variants proposed here on BGG.  My favourite is the gift > refuse for a game variant.

Very fun dexterity game. It's a lot of fun being evil and trying to find the most heinous pieces for your opponent - and then being amazed when they fit it on! It's a little expensive, but you get a lot of decently sized wooden pieces, which should be enough to play a decent amount of people - I've even with 9 people with even being close to running out if you recycle pieces.

Great concept. Striking and beautiful. But the game itself so often ends up being won by a careful economic manager in a good table position rather than by an excellent tower, which detracts from my enjoyment.

2011 Christmas.  Gerard's game.  Not had a chance to have a proper game of this but looking forward to it.  I think we were too eager to try and get each other to fail we forgot the fun we could have seeing what could be built.
2012 Apr tried a different game where we build together and last one to play a piece before it all crashes gets a diamond.  Much more fun and a good base to start looking at other variants.

A fun and interesting dexterity game in the mold of "Jenga" or "Villa Paletti". There are some different sets of rules which make the game more interesting (or boring). You can experiment to see which ones your gaming group likes best.

Funny little dexterity game with an auction mechanism built in. If you want to unwind after a long gaming session or if you simply want some good old fun then this is definitely a game for you. Just make sure you have a sturdy table and that no one bumps into it by accident

A great dexterity game. If I get it, I should get the base version (~$45) and then add a few of my own pieces. From the forums, the number of pieces seems to vary a lot.

My copy of this is Bandhu and it actually lives at my parents house for my nieces and nephews to play while they are there.  We added pieces from Stockade (a place that sells odd shaped wooden bits for craft items), and put a little wooden pot to hold the beans.  A fun dexterity game.  I still enjoy it.

I like stacking games, unfortunately my wife does not. This has a nice tension that comes with most stacking games (Jenga), but better as it has clear winner and each player makes critical choices. Most stacking games is just move the next piece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The ultimate stacking game. Jenga used to be my favorite game in this genre, but now Bandu (Bausack) is the new king. There are so many different blocks to place on your structure, which gives the game a lot of variation. The blocks are beautiful, and I always want to take a picture of the winning tower. The game is simple, but a lot of fun, and there is also some tactics thrown in (auction). A must buy.

Incredibly fun game.  Watching how people rank the various pieces is interesting.  We played with our own varients, with a lot of the horrible pieces removed to make for taller structures and longer games.

Good to play with just about anyone. Excitement is high as the structure grows taller and taller, more and more precarious. I've bought a colorful sack of blocks to add as well, which increases the gameplay options greatly. I love this game, and I think it's essential to any collection.

Revised from 7.5 to 9. The game is just plain brillant. The whole auction thing and risk taking in choosing the pieces makes the game extremely tense. And how can one not like a game made entirely of hard wood?

RATING: 7
Very interesting dexterity game. My only gripe is that I got a version containing red and non-painted pieces… and the non-painted ones have a much bigger friction when places against each other, which means you can place a piece onto a tilted plane… with the red ones, this is perfectly impossible as the friction is so low it'll just slip down. And I don't think this was intended.

For Trade

Modern art as a dexterity game.

Don't be fooled into thinking this is about trying to build to beat your opponents.

With experience, Bandu turns into a game of passing the buck. Either by forcing terribly awkward pieces onto your neighbours, or passing a piece around to make them use up their gem quota.

Baring this in mind you can often win the game with a 1-2 piece construction.

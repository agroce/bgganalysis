Way too swingy. I don't mind a good deal of luck to get the blood pumping, but you can be absolutely destroying it one second and then out of the game the next (and not due to mistakes, but just due to terrible draw combinations). It's a bit disheartening. The mechanics are fun, but I think some of the design is simply poor. I really enjoy some of the base flow of the game. I'm looking forward to seeing if Catalyst can improve upon this game with further expansions. Plus, acquiring Karma seems lousily implemented. It's the first game I've played that felt like it needed an XP house rule. So, I created one! I also highly recommend just giving yourself some starting karma to spend on upgrading the characters. It can make a huge difference in the fun factor, especially considering that the game feels mechanically sound, but sheer poop in balance world.

Great take on a cooperative campaign game. I like it much better than the Pathfinder card game. A very puzzle-y game. I would have liked to have a few more cards in the base game for the price, but it's still a worthwhile purchase. I look forward to some expansions.

Slightly disappointed in this one feeling the game kinda simple regarding just matching colors, however the coop aspect is where the game shines.  As a group, you really have to coordinate how you're gonna go at obstacles.  Like this better than Sentinels, plus I'm deck building.  Expansions will definitely make this game better.

Very good solo and cooperative card drafting game. The difficulty is very challenging!

OK, this game is a critical hit. And he kick your ass. Hard. And a lot of times.

With a great mechanic, he plays fast and very well. The rules are simple and ellegant and, look: shadowrun, babe!

Shadowrun is one of my favorites cenarios in the 90's when i play some RPG in the weekend with my fellas. So good memories and this game bring them back like a giant tsunami. The enemies here hit you hard, the missions are very, very deadly and you run like a coward most times you can imagine.

I recomend this one for anyone. One of my favorites for a lot of reasons, but the playing time and the simples rules are the most important.

And a last comment: here in Brazil we have a game called "Heróis e Monstros", a exactly copy of this one. In the ocasion of the "birth" on the brazilian game, i don't have any idea about Crossfire. Today im so disappointed with him...

A good brazilian game, but is a copy and nothing beyond this.

RATING: 8
A solid co-op game, with character progression between games.  It still has the 'alpha player' problem common to most co-ops, where if one player knows what they are doing and others do not, it can end up being one player dictating.  However, if all players are about the same skill level it is great.  The character progression is fun and aids replayability.

I can not understand the ranking average of 7.4pts here.. there is no special idea in the game. Its so simple! Opponent has health 4, so play card with 4 damage, thats all the game does. Different damage color, some event cards, text on opponent cards, some weapon cards. Missing also good ideas with player rules and races. Missions? Also Weak! For my opinion the price for the game is to high! (I was lucky to get it for EUR 40,00 in Essen/D). I would like to say: Its not a bad feeling when you play it, player must really work together to solve the dangers, but I am disappointed! Sorry! I hope there will be more in expansions!!!! :)

RATING: 5
Interesting concepts but it felt too scripted for the first plays. The guy who focuses on weapons buys all the weapons, the guy who focuses on hacking buys all the hacking, etc. There didn't seem to be much need to diversify, especially because the encounter cards are extremely different (and temporary) it probably isn't worth it disrupting your deck with an extra off-color card to kill a guy 1 turn faster.

Need to play more with the legacy powers to see how they impact gameplay before making a final decision, but this game felt extremely on-rails to me.

RATING: 9.5
A fantastic good cooperative game!! :) It have very cool mechanics and if you play a mission this kind of game remains in your memory as a nice experience.

Pro: - great quality components
     - cool play and cooperative mechanics
     - fast, interactive, nice deck developement 

Cons:- a bit too expensive 
     - stickers for upgrades sucks! (plastify them or paste on some cardstock and use these new TOKENS as u like when start a mission if enough karma)
     - too big box and sleeved cards don't fit inside well

After 30 games: this game is amazing good. I play it any time i want a strong sensation. Is like a true Archenemy against your team!




=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The theme is awful and not one I have ever liked, but the mechanics of the game are pretty good. 3 games - 1 win, 1 loss and 1 escape - it's a bit too difficult and you really do have to work together to stand any chance of winning this game. After 3 more drawn games, the game does feel very samey and just as difficult. I would not think there is much long term replayability but it is a game you can play from time to time without losing the game. I found it got boring quite quickly, during the second set of plays, hence the rating drop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
The only deck builder I will play.  Fantastic and highly addictive!

REVISION: I still love this game, but I can't rank it any higher.  I also play Star Realms now, so the "deck-builder" remark is no longer valid.  It is my favorite solo game.

1/22/16 - I came back to this game after a break in order to play the expansion.  Wow--why did I stay away so long? I forgot how tense and exciting a card flop could be.

Can't understand the hype about this one.

Great co-op deckbuilder, the artwork and character customization really lends itself well to the theme of the RPG, and the mechanics flow smoothly, some missions being a little more difficult than others. The only thing that might be holding this back is the general lack of scenarios, though, apart from the handful in the box or online. Forthcoming expansion will hopefully fix that. But otherwise, game is stunning.

So hard as to be pointless. The legacy elements seem undercooked - 1 Karma for an aborted run, 5 for a win? You'd have to play an ungodly amount of this game to get anywhere. There's aspects I do like about this... but Legendary Encounters does the same concept much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This has become my quick game goto for solo play.  quick setup and play, fast take down.  I have 4 plays in now, 2 wins 1 successful abort and 1 failure. Luck and skill.  Luck definately plays a roll, but one of my wins the crossfire was a grenade that sure staggered my troll but also took out the two obstacles facing him ....  tons of fun.  the 'leveling' will be fun as well.

RATING: 3
  A fun, interesting take on the Shadowrun RPG.  It is a bit easy once the rhythm is established, but the mechanic still provides tons of strategy.
  I knocked it down a points because there is a mechanic in the game that prevents you from drawing new cards.  Maybe we missed something in the rules, but until that time, my score remains as is.

RATING: 4.2
Has everything going for it: great and functional artwork, simple enough system, a great background universe that personally engaged me BUT (after only one game with the rules being explained to me, so..possible errors?) the game is tough..incredibly and mercilessly so..At least with 0-1 lvl characters. Never did I have illusions of mayyybe..poooossibly making it.lost after 3 or 4 rounds. The deckbuilding element of the game is quasi-non-existent (I got to buy maybe 2-3 cards in the whole span of the game before dying). If that's the really the case, I can't really see myself replaying this game without a serious level of moding the game. I heard that that was the idea in the creators' heads: coming up with a challenging and very tough game. They did it, it's just not for me.

Love the game, love the world, gives deckbuilding more depth, making it so much more than a mechanical exercise. Progressive character development, easy to play and manage up to 4 characters when playing solo, and lots of room to grow with expansions. This game challenges you to do more with less, and you will likely feel your back firmly against the wall every time out. A must-have for Shadowrun fans and worth a serious look from anyone who likes deckbuilding or combat card games of any kind. All things considered, this may be my favorite game.

Initial Impression: I'm a big fan of the Shadowrun universe, having played the 3rd edition RPG back in the late 80's. The wonderful artwork and street slang card text in this game convey the theme surprisingly well. The deckbuilding mechanism works well in the game, with purchasing upgrades from the black market and focusing your characters on the abilities you want them to progress in. Throughout the mission you get a feeling of a sense of building up your character. But, as all things Shadowrun, I feel as if it's a double edged sword. Once the mission is over, you can only retain Karma awards. What happened to all the equipment and skills you picked up along the way? My streetsam's katana is suddenly lost and I have to buy a new one? Every single time I go on a new mission? There's a serious thematic disconnect that I find limits my suspension of belief of the intended campaign style play. Overall the game is enjoyable as a quick playing card game for casual play but unfortunately I don't see myself investing long-term in order to build up characters. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This rating includes the High Caliber Ops expansion.

The difficulty level is steep when you first start out. After a number of plays it starts getting more obvious as to what needs to be done to have a chance of winning the mission. Like many co-ops, smart plays are not guaranteed to result in a win; sometimes the card draw can cause a loss. You have to play correctly (e.g., choose the right race/role combos and make smart buys to build a working deck) and you need the various decks to provide a beatable mission (some card combinations make failure a certainty). The first time you go 8+ crossfire cards deep and fight off 6+ hard obstacles to beat the mission is a sense of accomplishment that I haven't found in other deck builders, nor other coops. Add in the character progression, and this is a unique deckbuilder.

I should note that we house rule it to increase karma gains and/or reduce the karma penalties for playing some missions with higher karma runners. Otherwise, we'd likely never see the higher-priced karma upgrades. The default rules feel too close to an old-school RPG grind. This modification may not be needed if additional missions were included that smooth the mission progression and provide more variety.

Edit: April 2017. I dropped this rating to a 7 in view of the deficiencies in design mentioned above. If played with < 3 runners, this game requires a number of house rules to maintain balance and interest in the long term. The more I play it with 2 runners, the more apparent the issue in balance for lower play counts becomes. The game needs one more expansion to fix its problems and make it really good at more play counts. To support smaller player counts, it needs one or two mechanisms to lessen the impact of a bad black market draw. Moreover, even if the crossfire deck shuffle allows for a winnable state, playing with 2 runners also requires every player to play nearly perfectly, starting with the selection of a role/race combination. If an expansion comes, I would also welcome 1-2 scenarios that help smooth the progression a bit and/or a more fleshed out campaign/storyline. This game is balanced around and best with 3-4 runners; preferably 4. In fact, its really good at 4. When I play this solo from now on, I will likely only play with 4 runners.

*Edit, Sept. 2017: It's weird. This game is still one of my favorite deckbuilders, but the rating does not reflect my personal affinity for the game. When I read my criticisms for the game, I feel they are completely valid and that holds me back from moving this rating higher. That said, this game gets played more than other games I rate higher.

A superbly crafted co-op deck builder. I love how this game is puzzly in all get out but also remains incredibly thematic. I usually play this 4 player solitaire. The missions all seem to be well balanced (but hard!) and ooze theme. The idea of upgrading your character is fun to me as well. I have no problem putting stickers on the sheets as there are plenty of extra character sheets if you want to start a new group. I was a HUGE Shadowrun RPG player back in the 90's, and this is the closest I have felt to recreating that same feeling of chaos, dread and fun since then. My only negative about the game is that they just didn't include enough content in the base box. The High Caliber Ops expansion really is necessary to fully enjoy the game. I would have probably given this a 10 if the game came with the High Caliber stuff was included. Try this ASAP if you like co-op games, deck builders or both.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Probably like this a bit better than Pathfinder, since it is at least challenging, however this still wasn't that great.  If you like grinding, this is the game for you, however that was my LEAST favorite thing to do when playing an MMO, and I certainly don't want to do it in a board game.  This one felt like it kind of played out its self, as you don't really get a ton of cards, and its always obvious what you need to do (or in some cases, just do nothing, which is never good to have in a game).  Curious to hear the thoughts of others in my group, but I don't see us playing this one much, if ever again.

Don't even think of trying to play this solo without modifying the rules to make it even a little easier. It is brutal and your chance of winning solo is extremely slim. It gets easier with more people but the difficulty is still ridiculous. I want to like this game. I really do. I think it's a cool system with potential but the playing it is beyond frustrating when you lose 90% of the time or more.

This game is pure fun, and especially for anyone who was a fan of Shadowrun.  While the theme is not dripping it is there and you do see all the elements of running the shadows!  

This is one of the more brutal co-ops I have played (even though I have only played solo).  This game just kicks you in the teeth and then asks you if you want some more.  You of course ask for more, because that is what any good Shadowrunner would do!!

Its a nice deck building game but they hyped it as a campaign type game but the amount of points you need for meaningful upgrades is very high, and even when you have the upgrades you don't feel that much more powerful. As a non campaign deck builder I like it, but not as a campaign.

Waiting for the updated version of the base-game "This Prime Runner Edition of the Shadowrun: Crossfire Deckbuilding Game" said to be released in April. So I´m holding off all material except promos until I know what that edition will contain.

Love the cyberpunk setting, cool missionbuilt gaming and some character evolvement. (possible to adapt for me who don´t like the legacy-style). Great replayability - like a computergame with cards.

I already have the High Caliber Ops expansion for it due to an earlier mixup so this is a game I will get myself one day.

I liked this a lot the first time I played, but have some serious problems with the game after several plays. First of all: it's just too hard. We have still not been able to win after six or seven games, and yes, we might get better, but seriously I have no desire to keep playing this at the expense of playing other games I really do like. 

Second: if the karma awards were greater, we might have more incentive to want to continue, but as it is, we still haven't been able to level anything up, which has been extremely frustrating. I don't want to have to play this game 100 times just to get one stupid sticker on my character sheet. And third: at it's core, this is just a generic deck builder, no more innovative or interesting than others like it (LOTR DBG, Star Trek DBG, Legendary, etc.), and the scenarios don't make it more interesting either. This was the game that finally broke my love-affair with Rahdo, because this game is not the Holy Grail of Gaming he made it out to be. Sold.

Highly random.  Sometimes you draw tough obstacles and crossfires and get stomped and there isn't anything you can do about it.  The "campaign" is poor: play one scenario many times in a row, then play the next scenario many times in a row, then play the last one.  There's only 3 scenarios and they have minimal contextual information to give you any sense of a story progression.  Those things aside, I enjoy puzzling out the best moves as a team and there are some interesting combinations of plays that you can come up with.  

I'll play it, but I won't suggest it.

Nice little co-op/deckbuilder even though I'm not a huge fan of either genre. The four classes and the black market add some variability from game to game and some interesting customization is possible along with the traits. The starting obstacles can really make or break the missions in an already difficult game.

Tough but fun.  Great deck builder.  I have lost way more than I have won but when you do win it is always an event.  Game really sings with High Caliber OPs expansion.  The leveling system is fun and fits with Shadowrun.  Enjoy Solo (2-3 runners) or 3-4p games.

RATING: 9
I rate this game very highly, because:

1) I love Shadowrun and 
2) this game is really well produced and put together

This game is also exceedingly hard, so don't expect to win, but that is in step with how Shadowrun actually is. Aborted missions are the norm, wins are few and far between. Any karma you earn will help you, but it will take some time to customize your characters. Take a look at the game's BGG page for printable character sheets if you don't want to use the stickers, but it's a really fun game, and a great experience that captures the 6th world very well.

It would be a 10, except it needs more missions packed in for variety, and the rule book could be a little tighter.

RATING: 7
I think the game mechanics are solid. What lets the game down is the difficulty balancing. The scenarios are not difficult, they are punishing! Very very swingy, depending on the Obstacle and Crossfire cards drawn.

The game designers also dropped the ball as there's no thematic campaign included. Something that could easily have been done since it just needs some thought and a few extra cards printed. So it feels like half a game.

If you're willing to go the extra mile to make up your own scenarios, including the Karma gains and leveling up, it can turn into a pretty good game.

Actually kind of impressed. I went into the game with a lot of skepticism. The game reminded me of Lord of the rings and Pathfinder(streamlined). I think it needs more than just the base game to have any sort of replay value because most of the player cards are similar, but there is little deck  building to startup, which is really cool. Definitely a thematic game that will play better with more players, I played a solo game, and having lots of player interaction will make it slightly easier to win, because solo is TOUGH. Looking forward to playing with more players to see the interactions and combinations.

Tempted to get this, at least after they print the new edition, but the whole stickers thing, and the grinding thing, are not enticing.  If I wanted to grind I'd play an MMO, and legacy stuff really turns me off.  I know some people stick them to cardboard and cut them out but that seems like a huge amount of work - essentially print n play.

RATING: 8
The box is a bit disappointing in that the components don't even fill half of the insert.  The game however feels like it knows it didn't need that.  It is at the start very simple, but each turn feels like a puzzle on how you and your friends can just survive to the next puzzle.  I do really like the design, but strongly recommend playing with exactly 4 players.  With 2 it felt like certain enemies would end it alone, but with 3 it felt closer to manageable, especially with the expansion thrown in to have someone fill 2 roles better.  Losing 3 games really made our first win feel like a true victory.  The turns where you scramble to search for a winning strategy among the horror the deck brings is exhilarating.

The game is fun and requires players to work together as the game can be very hard. I alway liked Shadowrun fluff so the theme is a plus for me as well. 

The thing that is keeping me away from giving a higher rating is the lack of different scenarios included in the box. In the base rulebook there is 3 : crossfire (basic game), the client and the dragonfight. You can download 2 more online: the portal and ambulators. I found scenarios like the client and the portal to be lots of fun, more than the basic game. Unfortulatly there is not a lot more as for now. I might try to make some scenarios myself but I prefer official playtested material.

I was hesitant to part with it, but its value skyrocketed after it went out of print. Kind of hard to pass up the opportunity to flip it for a decent profit.

I'm disappointed. It is a bit because I was quite hyped beforehand also I had different expectations.
I expected a co-op deckbuilder. Something like Legendary, co-op version of Hero Realms or so. This is nothing like those games. This is not necessarily a bad thing but I couldn't find enough enjoyment in Shadowrun Crossfire.

What I liked so far:
-amaaaaaaaazing atmosphere 
-great and matching art
-the idea of a steampunk deckbuilder
-the idea of character development

What I didn't like:
-this is not a real deckbuilder
---you draw only a few cards and only if you have a few
---you can buy only a few 2-3 cards which makes building working combos way too hard
---you go through your deck 2 max 3 times per runs
-waaaaay too grindy if you follow the karma rules
-too wide difficulty spread between enemies
-if you fall behind it is too hard to catch up and turn around the run

Overall I think I'll probably play more but I can say I won't buy this game.

Update from 4 to 3:
I've played Dragonfire and all the terrible memories came out. That is a better game what I don't want to play again so... please reuse the artwork to make an actually good game.

Though I have not played this game with 4 players (only 1 and 2) it plays well.  It is fun and challenging! It is fast and easy to get a few games in at a time. The best part is how much conversation goes on each turn!  It's what a co-op should be, and I hope for many expansions to keep this one going.  Theme doesn't matter (although I'm ok with the Shadowrun universe as a backdrop, and I am sure it will lend to some inspiring stories), because the game is all in your role and card combos! Tough choices to be made at every turn (which enemies to hit first and in what order, to save a card or play it now, I want so many cards off the black market, soooo many stickers!!!! etc...

Hope to play this for years to come!

Quick, brutal co-op. The card art and flavor capture the feel of Shadowrun nicely, but sadly, it took very little time before I was only paying attention to the corner icons of my cards - the player action system feels more abstracted than I want in a thematic game. (And... all the roles start with at least one card of each type? Mechanically good, but thematically bizarre.)

Highly cooperative deck builder and difficult to win. You often have to play cards to assist your teammates or cause teammates to be able to play cards outside of their turn.

What cards to play seems pretty straightforward though and the deckbuilding as well. Not every decision seems to be weighty.

Character building through experience points and special powers rather than cards, but not sure if there's an interesting campaign or story to play through with a consistent group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It misses the main point of deckbuilders. By the end of a crossfire game, most of your deck is going to be the basic cards, which don't have any effect besides their color.

Nuyen rewards are low, and are based entirely on defeating enemies, which can be very hard. In a 4 player game, many enemies pay out only 1 to each player with 1-2 people getting an extra if you are lucky, with good cards going for anywhere from 4-8 nuyen and cheap cards, which are less prevalent than the expensive ones, eating up the entire reward. Worse is the fact that 3 of the classes, deckers, faces, and samurai, are highly combo dependant.

In the standard game, there are 12 enemies. The standard enemies are ironically sometimes harder than the hard enemies, they just pay out more. But because they take so long to kill you get new cards painfully slow most games. And because the hard enemies may pay out literally 1 nuyen to 2 players sometimes, you may just end up playing a game where most people got like 3 cards they used 3 times.

It is also very random and hard because of this. Because most of your cards are just typed damage, and your options to purchase are so limited, you end up with games where one player may never have gotten a card more exciting than a 2 cost damage card from someone else's class. It will mostly come down to getting easy enemies and lucky draws to kill them fast due to how little control you have.

High Calibur ops fixes this a bit by increasing nuyen reward on all new enemies over what they were in the base game, and introducing a new "enemy" that does no damage and merely exists to give you money if you kill it.  There are also now enemies that give low money, but a helpful reward when killed, which helps speed everyone up into getting their first cards and getting past the initial "Everyone is taking 1/4th of their health in damage every turn!" problem by letting you kill a few enemies in a row. Finally most of the enemies require far fewer cards to kill.

The hybrid roles, which are a class that one of the players who is playing the class that they are a hybrid of can take, which increase the density of two basic card types at the expense of the other two, also are a godsend. 

The Rigger is pretty bad but can see play in a game with a small group, because the combos that street samurai and deckers depend on having a lot of cards in their own class. The decker is especially worse off mixing colors, but the rigger sorta works as a side-decker if you want to make use of the new drones, which are ok.

The mage-face class, the social adept, is however, amazing and fixes a lot of problems with both the mage and the face. The mage class shouldn't take it, because they really depend heavily on class purity, buying as large a spell as they can any time they can and avoiding everything else unless its necessary to survive. But the face looooves being a social adept rather than the face. The face's unique cards are the only class cards that reward you for playing cards of another class, so they love having spells. And because faces are the "Support" player they often end up buying random low cost spells the main mage doesn't want. And the new face-spell hybrid cards are fun to use and powerful. Everything about the social adept is wonderful. As a bonus, having two people buying spells and with extra basic spell damage cards is great because, as the mage is mostly just buying a few huge nukes and keeping their deck small, they will often not have upgraded spells to kill magical enemies quickly, so two people doing that is very helpful.

That said, High Calibur ops doesn't fix the nuyen problem. And karma is also way too slow. My recommended houserule is to double all nuyen rewards, so that people can gear up much quicker and the game gets a more reasonable rate of difficulty.

For post game rewards, I play so that all karma rewards are doubled, and that all games give a minimum of 5 karma, so that no matter what you can always buy something. It just isn't fun to go through a bunch of games to earn your first upgrade, it makes it feel like an MMO grind and even with double rewards you will be playing for a long time getting all the upgrades. Finally, I just use karma as a floating pool, allowing players to change their upgrades as they wish unless I am playing with people who already know the game. The karma system isn't really well set up as a legacy mechanic and its much more fair and interesting choosing powers as you go and never "wasting" slowly earned karma overwriting a very minor early game benefit.

Finally, I recommend not playing the "basic" mission, crossfire, with new players. It is rather difficult. High caliber ops introduced a new beginner run with increased rewards, but the escort mission is also much easier than crossfire and much less random. The issue with crossfire is that everyone is constantly taking damage and its a race to deal as much damage as fast as you can when everyone deals damage very slowly for most of the game. 

Escort mission gives you a "Ghost" player who's job it is for the team to protect, but they do two things to make the game easier and more tactical. The first is that enemies aren't spawning in big waves with everyone being constantly attacked most of the game as new enemies spawn in after all the old ones are defeated. Instead, enemies spawn by turn, in smaller, more manageable numbers. Second is that the ghost player by default tanks all enemies, but you are allowed to pull an enemy to you if it matches your class, meaning that now you can make tactical decisions about damage, which combined with the fact there are fewer enemies spawning at once and enemies don't spawn faster the faster you kill them, you may actually survive early missions.

The deck building is more satisfying than Dominion because purchased cards go into your hand. Crossfire events that throw a wrench into your plans are interesting because they generate surprise.

But in four games now I could tell we were going to lose long before it happened, yet the game slowed down and dragged on for another hour. And in other games we got good cards early and it was too quick and easy. This is reversed: when you're having fun the game should last; when you're not, it should end sooner.

Also, even with only 3 players, and with cards you can play on other players' turns, there's occasionally considerable downtime.

I prefer simpler, faster-moving games with more tension from endgame uncertainty.

REALLY not our cup of tea this one.  If it weren't for it's legions of fans, I'd go so far as to say this game is poorly designed to the point of being broken.  It is monstrously frustrating, which if it had strong theme or deep storytelling I could forgive.  Big book of madness, for example; we've not beaten it yet and that's ok - THAT is a good game.  If I want to spend half an hour getting stressed out by having a load of unpredictable crap dumped in my lap, I'll just go to work instead, thank you.

RATING: 8
So...I was about to sell this game after my sixth play due to frustration.  I also hate the art and theme.  Thirty plays later, I love this game; and I for realsies look forward to playing it at least 30 more times. 

This game has a steep learning curve - you need to have a good working knowledge of the black market cards and how to use them best.  You need to know the understand when it's best to use money.  You need to learn to think a few moves ahead, and hash out a plan with your team.  Once you get your first five karma, and snag an upgrade, you'll probably start winning more.  Once you get 25 karma you'll wonder why you ever thought the game was so hard, and you'll have to make it harder.  This game works great with any player count - you just have to put the time in to learn it.  

When playing with less than four players I strongly recommend using the Decker and Mage.  Their card powers are a little more obvious in their usage and they can pump out damage pretty steadily.

Despite my general dislike of coops, I've fallen head over heels for this one. You really have to work together and communicate well to win.  Sometimes you have to play the odds, which is both frustrating and exciting.  You have to buy the right cards at the right time, and be really careful about when you use the cards in your hand.  

Being a coop game, I think the difficulty is spot on.  Sometimes though the game feels too tough in comparison to how simple the gameplay is - you're essentially just matching card colors.  But that's the thing that makes this game interesting, and maybe even brilliant - the gameplay is easy, but the decisions are excruciating.  One wrong move and the game is over.  It's a good thing it plays fast and is easy to set up.

I was pretty down on this game at first, and it had to do with the game being difficult but not complex.  All you have to do on your turn is figure out when and where to play your cards; but these simple decisions are going to affect how much damage you take, what you can buy at the end of your turn, what your hand size will be the following turn, and what your potential options will be.  And in this game all those things are extremely important.  You really have to think it through and on top of that you need to coordinate with everyone else.  

I'm also not used to games ending abruptly because I made a bad choice - this is not a forgiving game.  In fact, I'd say it forgives nothing, but that's just because it's so lean - it's just you and the cards.  You fight, kill, and fight some more until you win or die; and in that way, I suppose this game succeeds at conveying its dark brutal dystopian theme.

Its a deck builder. It's a co-op game.

It plays pretty fast, which I'm not sure if it's good or bad, but you definitely don't get to build much deck.

It is different. A Risk Legacy type self changing game, It does it in a much better manner, in that you don't actually destroy the base game as you play through the campaign, and you can replay it, and relive the self morphing game aspect.

At first absolutely felt frustration with this game, but then realized I was making some mistakes. I was starting with hard for the initial obstacle difficulty, I thought you could only buy 1 card per round, and I played with a character with only 4 starting health (crazy).  I'm now have worked myself up to 25+ in upgrades.  

Update 12-8-17
I'm really getting tired of this game.  I believe I'm playing it now more because its short set up time than from the thrill of playing the game.  The wrong cards, draws, black market deck can kill your game early.  There are many times where I do not feel that I am exactly playing the game, but rather that the game is pushing me to do the most logical specific actions needed for a given circumstance.  I don't know how much true manipulation of the events I really am doing, or how much I'm just painting by numbers.  Dropped rating from 7 to 6.
Because of this, I'm really hesitating getting Dragonfire.

RATING: 9
After first dozen games, so far so good. Love how challenging the missions are. I don't think I've ever high-fived my gaming partner so many times in one sitting before! Pulling off a good round is *really* exciting in this game precisely because the odds are stacked so high against you. 
Am a little wary of the possibility of boredom with the mechanics setting in. For the moment they seem omplex and rich enough, but I'm anxiously awaiting the moment that eventually came with Pandemic, where every choice becomes an obvious not-choice (e.g., given condition x, the correct response is to do y). Also wondering how long before the prospect of upgrading loses its excitement (even though that excitement is *very* strong right now. I'm thinking back to Diablo here, where you play frantically and addictively for days or even weeks, until you finally realize that all this time you've been upgrading simply for the sake of upgrading -- there goes all the glitter. 

Loving the game now though! It has even managed to enthral my stubbornly anti-cooperation friend, who up until yesterday absolutely refused to even try a cooperative game, so sure was he that such games had nothing to offer him in the way of strategic enjoyment.

Looking forward to seeing what can be done with expansions, to exploring solo play, to taking on the Dragon in a large group!

Heavy on teamwork, sense of urgency, and the feeling of skating along by the skin of your teeth and good teamwork, this game captures some of the best feelings from a good game of Shadowrun in a deckbuilding-with-cross-game-progression package.

The Pathfinder Adventure Game wishes it was this good of a representation of its inspiration game.

That said, not enough ongoing content support to keep the game fresh, limited scenarios ultimately killed this in a different way than I lost interest in PAG.

So far, I am really enjoying this game. Some people might get turned off by the sheer difficulty of this game, but I rather like a challenge. At it's best, this game offers a good puzzle to be solved with a group of people. At its worst, it is frustratingly hard. Over time your characters become better and that is kind of the saving grace of this game. 

If you want a challenge with some cool thematic elements and interesting gameplay, this is it. 

However if you aren't ready for the challenge or to put in a number of failures before that first sweet victory comes, you might be in for a disappointment.

Based on 1 4-player game.  Well designed/balanced co-op with high difficulty as most co-ops should have.  Did manage to win our first play but I can see it takes a lot of breaks to do so.  Great card art.  Like any co-op it could suffer from one person dominating all moves but with the right group it shines.  Doesn't last too long and the satisfaction from winning is solid.  Would play again.

This game came out of nowhere to be one of my new favorite games. I’m not familiar with the Shadowrun world, but as much as I love high fantasy, I find the modern twist refreshing. Gimme a dwarf on a motorcycle with an Uzi vs more LOTR knockoffs. You play “runners” who are constantly hired by a Mr. Johnson to perform a variety of tasks for him – assuming they survive the mission. 

Each mission is played in a series of obstacles that must be defeated through card symbols and effects. As with other traditional deckbuilders, you can buy new cards at the end of your turn -- though they go directly into your hand for next turn.  And I love the angle on deckbuilding this one takes. The focus is tighter than strategic or tactical and takes it to the level of immediate. 

That is, you frequently need to purchase the card that will help you on your very next turn as opposed to a card you might like better, all things being equal. That may not sound like fun or that it hamstrings your decisions but that’s not the case. Figuring out what card(s) you can truly afford to buy at the end of your turn – and making sure you can survive the next turn -- is the bulk of the fun. 

It is an odd duck in how there's no mitigation. It rewards/punishes fast/slow starts. [i]Oh, you got off to a slow start? Well, here's some extra hard obstacles that will further beat you down... See? You're dead.[/i] I'm not sure what the thinking is there, but I now value the upgrades where you get an extra starting card to help get off to a faster start. 

The only aspect lacking for me (making it a 9 instead of 10) is a context such as a campaign where I can make my games fit into a larger story. I’ve solved this for myself by stringing together different missions and counting my attempts vs my Karma earned. But I would prefer to have something designer created; maybe they’ll eventually make one in a future expansion.  On that note, I strongly recommend the Character Pack #1 expansion as well as High Caliber Ops for additional cards and missions. 

And all that said, I just love the tight puzzle the game offers me. I think it's best as a solitaire game because 1) one person controls the puzzle more effectively than trying to get multiple people to do so and 2) one person enjoys the eureka moment more fully themselves than figuring it out with others.

[b]Sold[/b] on 2017-07-08 - I really dig this game, but the theme and gameplay tweaks of Dragonfire are so appealing to me that I got rid of it while it was between print runs, so I could put that money toward a new copy of Dragonfire.

Previous Comments:

It took watching several videos of people playing, and following along with a bunch of strategy threads, before this game finally 'clicked', but when it did, the experience was very rewarding.  Shadowrun: Crossfire packs a lot of deep strategic gameplay into a short time period, and creates more table talk than many other coops.  While it's called a "deck builder", the way the game uses money and high value cards which can be comboed in clever ways creates an entirely different feel.  If you try to play Shadowrun like a normal deck builder, you will lose badly.  The strategies are deeply cooperative and allow players to use their strengths to work around other players' weaknesses.  I was slow to warm up to this game, but it's really grown on me.

The main downside is that, due to the fact that strategies are so counter intuitive, the game is difficult to pick up and play without sticking with the same group over and over again.  Also, I could skip the upgrade system / persistence - it feels completely like a gimmick.

This one is tough & addictive! Mechanically quite easy to grasp, plays quickly & with enough variety in the base set. Playing solo (2 handed) is smooth after the 1st 2 plays & the limited amount of cards in your deck is easy to manage.
The learning curve is quite steep & calls for an interesting "sit down & pause for a min" challenge. You could very much fall into an autopilot mode where you would repeat the same play patterns & end up making the same mistakes again & again.
More than initially meets the eyes plus the "persistence" of the stickers/experience/karma points makes for a really deep, solid & "just more more play" game.

A chaotic mess! The mechanics are fun and the idea is great, bu the execution is abhoring. You are suppose to level up, but 99 percent of the upgrades are either useless or boring (+1 card, +1 health etc.). And those events are too chaotic and some of them should be rewritten to say: You loose! So if you don't get them, tou win and if you do, you lose.

Extremely difficult and very, very collaborative play. You're guaranteed to lose unless the table is working together, and even on your best play the run might just go sideways no matter what you do. I find this game very rewarding because the wins are truly earned, and your character permanently changes over time giving you a lot of investment.

It all boils down to how much you like the Shadowrun setting. If you're a fan, this is an instabuy without looking back. The game's hard and it has also tweaks which will render it even harder! What's not to like?

If you can't see other than matching symbols instead of narrative actions your team is doing, then chances are you won't like this game. If you can see those, then you'll have a narrative and stories might unfold in front of your eyes for a tense and fantastic experience. :)

I love this game! First off, I don't know much about the Shadowrun universe, this was the first game I played that takes place there. 

It's very hard! We played it many times before we beat our first mission and it was very rewarding ...and frustrating, as it didn't give us enough karma to get our first upgrade.

The notion of progression is very enticing, gives me another reason to pick this game over another and I can see that the upgrades will be enough for a very long time.

Some people are angry that there are only three missions, but at this point I'm very happy to see there are several other missions you can download and print off the game's website.

Insane cool experience with crazy combos you pull off working with your team. My favorite game of all time. Plus I love the art. Sticker system actually ended up being my favorite part

Biggest draw back is the random events. Some are bad. Some are chaotic and may help you out. Others are just plain evil and will end the game. Wish there were more chaotic natured cards. 

But this is perhaps the only game where 80% of the time where I did win, it was my the skin of my teeth and I couldn't believe it because it usually involved some crazy combo move.

Kereszttűzben
Ezzel a játékkal több kört is futottam az életemben. Elsőre Zoli barátunk hozta be kipróbálni a társas klubba. A Shadowrun világát szerepjátékos ex-hobbim miatt már ismertem, megszerettem, anno hazánkban megjelent jobb-rosszabb könyveket is olvasgattam. Csapatjátékról lévén szó kíváncsian vártam az első találkozást, majd a nap végén savanyú szájízzel nem kértem belőle többet.
Szerencsére a klub kockamágusa, Gábor kölcsönkérte a játékot és jól kitapasztalta, megkedvelte, így szinte ránk kényszerítve még egy próbát. És milyen jól is tette!
Mostanára nagy kedvencé vált a játék, amelyben a világból már ismert kezdő humán, törp, troll, ork vagy tünde árnyvadászokként (dekás, utcai szamuráj, mágus és közvetítő/seftes/„arc”) próbáljuk hírnevünket építgetni a szokásos küldetések (védelem, zsarolás, adatlopás, kimenekítés és más piszkos ügyek) végrehajtásával.
Itt megjegyezném, hogy a játékhoz nem szükséges a Felébredt Világ ismerete, azonban erősen ajánlott, nagyon sokat tesz hozzá, na meg egy jó játékmester, akinek segítségével könnyebben megemészthető az, hogy ez kérem szépen egy nehéz játék. Többet buksz, mint nyersz. Hiába vagy felkészült, a megjelenő ellenfelek képesek a legerősebb csapatot is pillanatok alatt szétzúzni.
A játék itt is fordulókból, azon belül a vadászok köreiből áll. Minden fordulóban a kezdőjátékos húz egy lapot az úgynevezett Kereszttűz kártyák közül, amelynek hatása az egész fordulóra érvényes lesz és amelyben szinte csak a vadászok életét megnehezítő események történnek (sőt minél több időt, fordulót töltesz el a küldetéssel, azok hatása annál kedvezőtlenebb).
Utána végre következhetnek vadászaink is, aki a játék előtt kiválasztott küldetés célját próbálják teljesíteni (Maga a játék igen szegényes küldetések terén. Összesen 4 található benne. Szerencsére a BGG-n található variánsok, rajongók által készített küldetések nagyon jól használhatóak, sőt több fordítását és betesztelését már meg is csinálta kis árnyvadász csapatunk.).
A vadászok saját lapjaik felhasználásával saját körükben (bizonyos lapok esetében a társuk körében is) küzdenek meg a megjelent ellenfelekkel (akadályokkal), majd a le nem győzött ellenfelek sebzését elszenvedik, lapot húznak és lapot vásárolhatnak (hiszen a játékot csak „alapszintű” kártyákkal kezded és az értékesebbeket meg kell vásárolnod – itt jön a nagy kérdés, megvásárolni egy-egy kisebb értékű hasznos lapot, vagy spórolni egy ütős tutira).
A sikeres küldetések után a játékosok külön tapasztalati pontokat (karmát) szereznek (van lehetőség a bukott küldetésekből is minimális tapasztalatot megszerezni) és itt jelenik meg a játék másik lényeges eleme. A felhalmozott pontokból a vadászok különböző fejlesztéseket vehetnek meg, amelyek segítségével nagyságrendekkel megnőhet egy-egy küldetés túlélési aránya, sőt egyes küldetések előfeltétele bizonyos számú fejlesztés megléte. Ebből következik, hogy a játékosok számára lehetőség van életút játékra, amelyben egy-egy választott vadásszal játszanak végig küldetéseket fejlesztve őt eljutva addig, hogy megküzdjön a csapat egy Sárkánnyal is.
Egy-egy játékra azonban a csapat akár előre megegyezhet, hogy bizonyos számú karmát elkölt, így próbálgatva egyes küldetéseket, képességeket.
Nagy előnye a játéknak a gyors előkészítés, gyors játékmenet. Kezdők számára hátrány a játék küldetéseinek nehézsége, az egyes fajok közötti egyenlőtlenség, egyes fejlesztések hasztalansága. Ehhez játéktapasztalat kell, tehát ki kell próbálni. Mindenképpen ajánlom!

I wasn't expecting to love this game so much. I like drafting games and this one has enough of a twist to make it different then some others out there. I love the theme even if I am not familiar with the shadowrun universe. 

The neat feature is the sense of progression has you play more often,your character gains karma (experience) which allows you to unlock skills that helps you afterward. This sense of progression and permanence helps adds unique and interesting twist to the genre.

RATING: 7
I think many of the complaints leveled against this game are rooted in the fact that it does not disguise when luck of the draw hoses you. Other co-ops can lead to unwinnable (or near-unwinnable) situations, but they tend to disguise it--the ordering of a deck, the throw of a die, etc. 
So it's hard, but really quick. That's the right balance, clearly. I enjoy it, but the leveling up is rather shallow, and the scenarios are very limited. The variety is provided by the Crossfire cards and the enemies.
[EDIT] The longevity really takes a hit due to how incredibly situational and (relatedly) unappealing the mid-range upgrades are. 5 karma gets you a nice boost, but then the 10 and 15-cost ones stink.

Picked this game up at GenCon 2014.  My husband and I have been running a 2 player game.  The game is hard and I expect it to remain hard for a while but it is a lot of fun.  Having characters to carry forward into future missions is awesome.  I was concerned about the use of stickers but after buying the character expansion I decided that it really wasn't that big of a deal and there are ways around having to stick them onto the character cards if it really bothers you.  I highly recommend this game.

Nice co-op deck building card game, for those that think that Dominion is too competitive.

What a boring drag!
It has one interesting novelty, the common pool of black market cards for everyone to buy.
Unfortunately it's not really deck-builder, the runs are so short that you can usually only buy 2-4 cards.

If you know Ghost Stories, it's ghost stories without the spacial element, and with cards instead of dice.

The fighting is completely deterministic, meaning planning is paramount.. meaning it, like so many other co-ops, becomes a simple puzzle solving excercise. Usually with the most clever player either telling the others what should be done, or giving in into defeat because he doesn't wanna be perceived as the alpha gamer.

The box is incredibly over-sized and with simple cards as the only component way too over-prized.

It's a real pitty, but lately i'm really fed up with these shiny money-grabbing ameritrash games.

RATING: 7
Pros:
Quick co-op deck-builder with character progression between games. The game allows (and requires) players to work and plan together. The co-op aspect is good.
Bad:
Randomness: Randomness can be somewhat mitigated by good play, but every couple of games you will be screwed over by bad card draws.
Lack of scenarios: The game need more scenarios in order to stay interesting. Preferably scenarios that scales in difficulty.

Edit: The High Caliber Ops expansion seems to smooth the randomness out.

A solid good game that could really shine, but doesn't as is.
Rating could increase if I managed a 50% success ratio, but right now it's fairly low.
Also, I feel there are so many roleplay opportunities missed through more scenarized missions.
Gaining so little XP per play doesn't make that an incentive for me, either.

Need to play non-solo again.

Wow. I was completely blown away upon my first play-through of this game. Upon first glance it looks like any other deck builder, but that is basically the only resemblance it has with other deck-builders, the fact it shares that mechanic. 

The game is a cooperative deck building game, but has each player select a class/role character sheet, each with different max health, opening hand, and currency(ngyuen} But it's not just an avatar, you can name you character and make them your own, because one of the greatest things about this game is the idea of permanence. The game comes with a handful of varying "missions" aka alternatives setups, so no two games will be the same, and upon successfully completing the mission, you and your team will earn karma, basically experience points, that can be used to apply upgrades. These upgrades radically change now how you tackle scenarios and some of the harder boss encounters in the game. Some simple things, like starting with more money, or adding an extra basic card to your deck to dealing double damage with a card per turn or being able to refresh the available cards to buy in the black market. It truly feels like an rpg experience with your own character that you worked hard on.

But the game is no cakewalk, even with the idea of leveling characters. What makes this game unique is every round a crossfire card will be in effect that will make things easier or in most cases punishing, so it really requires cooperation from your fellow teammates in deciding which threat to deal with next. They're a ton of different obstacles, both normal and hard, and crossfires, on top of the different missions, to make this game unique in almost every play session. 

I know one of the many laments from people is the "idea" of placing stickers on my game. Honestly I was on the same boat, but I quickly looked past that. This isn't a Legacy game by any means. If all character sheets are full of upgrades you can still play the game! And there are ways to make even the easiest scenarios harder, further increasing replayability. Also the "lack" of cards is another, the base comes with enough cards to last a while. Every obstacle and crossfire is unique and chances are you won't see all of them even after 30 plays, let alone the different combination for each. The Black market cards are all amazing, which brings me to another thing I love. They really did an amazing job putting some great combination of cards into this game. 

The game has fallen a bit from graces for me. Mainly cause of its leveling/upgrade system. Most missions only give 3 karma(AKA experience), and give less if you are at a certain Karma threshold. To me that's dumb. All upgrades cost an amount that is divisible by 5, so giving three is pretty stupid as well as you get absolutely nothing if you fail, which is a big problem with new players cause they will checkout after a couple of plays. I've house-ruled that missions give 5, and a failure gives 1, and adjusted others that give more accordingly. Because honestly the upgrades are a novel idea, but the ones you can get aren't exactly remarkable, until you get to the 20-30 karma ones, and the game can still kick your butt relentlessly. I feel the economy was done pretty poor in this game considering how awesome it is, and I personally hate house-ruling, but it isn't an extreme detriment to the game overall I think.

Even what I said above, and whether you decide to play normal or house-ruled, I still highly recommend this game, as well as it's first major expansion [thing=180049][/thing]which adds even more content, and is essential and should be adding even when teaching new players. Truly amazing game and experience.

UPDATE: After Dragonfire's announcement, which is an rpg style deck builder using the Crossfire system, another expansion has been announced for Shadowrun! I'm extremely happy about this, because the game has been stagnant on my shelf, and I contemplating trading/selling it off, but I'm glad to hear Catalyst will continue to support the game even with the launch of Dragonfire, which seems to have a wealth of content lined up for it too. Happy to hear

Huge potential! The leveling up mechanic is very interesting...
11Feb18- This is a very hard game.  The leveling up, which I like, can take a very long time and multiple dozens of plays. I have gotten "attached" to my character and have enjoyed watching him evolve, which adds to an already great theme.  There is a ton of content for it now, offering character packs and expansions to keep the game fresh.
  For those that don't want the slow burn of having to play all the games to get super powerful characters to use, there is the very real and easy option of simply "sticking up' a few characters and getting right into it. I recommend having a few runs under your belt before you do that, just to have a clear understanding of what you are making.

Punishingly brutal to a not fun extent. Played the intro mission about four times, failed horribly every time. Thought, hmm, something's not right here. Popped on to BGG, read some strategy tips, got some good advice. Tried again, another four times, still died every time, only very slightly less horribly. I was struggling to find the fun in this process, so I uttered some words of anglo-saxon, packed the game away, and sold it.

Things to like
-The strongly co-operative structure is interesting, really encourages team play.
-The setup is simple and the game plays quickly (especially if you die after four turns.)
-The art is mostly pretty decent.
-I sold it very quickly.

Things to dislike
-Difficulty level. This ranges from punishingly tough to ridiculously punishingly tough, depending on which combination of obstacle and crossfire cards you randomly flip up.
-Heroes are very weak and vulnerable. The Elf has four hit points. There are many enemies that do two damage a turn. You might easily end up facing two such enemies. Good luck killing them both in one turn.
-Turns where you can't do anything useful. Sure, you have to manage your hand to try and get the icons you need in your hand when you need them, but too often that's just not possible. Already played your one Street Smarts card and need another? Tough, take some damage. Got three cards in hand but need four damage to clear the first level on this obstacle? Tough, take some damage.
-The Death Spiral. If you have a couple of turns where you can't achieve anything, you're pretty much done. You might think that you can hang back and build up a hand of useful cards, do the old rope-a-dope. Nah. You'll take damage from obstacles each turn, and when you reach zero HP you are 'staggered.' This means you bin your hand, and draw one card at the start of your turn. Is your one card enough to defeat your obstacles? No? Take more damage. Now you're 'critical' and can't do anything. Ideally your team mates can help you avoid the death spiral, but chances are they'll be doing the exact same thing on their side of the table.
-Not enough deckbuilding. You'll probably get to buy three or four cards over the course of a game, in the intro scenario anyway. They generally give you an extra damage icon, and possibly some sort of deck manipulation ability. Some cards are pretty powerful. They'll cost you nine cash, good luck living long enough to save up for that. And if a healing card doesn't show up in the market, forget about it.
-Theme is pretty weak. Big fan of Shadowrun since the nineties, it's such a rich and interesting world, with loads of cool characters and locations. Getting all that into the game sounds complicated though, so instead of trying they just make things match to different colours (so blue is magic, and green is hacking) and mentioned trolls on the cards' flavour text. That'll do won't it?
-The experience system. Oh my goodness, the experience system! For completing the opening mission, you get three XP.  Successfully 'aborting' a failing mission, which I found impossible, get you one XP.  Failure gets you zero. Your first upgrade costs 5 XP. So you'll have to beat the intro mission at least twice, or 'abort' five times, or fail an infinite number of times, to earn that first upgrade. And when you get it it will be something like 'you start with one extra card' or 'one more hp' or something similarly marginal. Then you get to go off again, only now you need FIFTEEN XP to earn your next upgrade. 

Slogging through this constant nut-punch of a game to earn enough XP to get one pony upgrade seems like pure masochism to me.

I'd rather play: 
Legendary Encounters: Alien - for a challenging but fun deck-building experience with lots of variety.
Warfighter - for a team-based combat game with a progressive campaign system.
50 Shades of Grey: The Game - for an honest take on masochism.

Super swingy.  Gave this a good couple of tries with a talented crew, and we just got blown out by adversaries and events that we just had no ability to beat.  I like a challenge, but a game where your decisions do not affect game outcome is poor design.  This needed way more play-testing.

Difficulty is through the roof but for the wrong reason - randomness.
While other co-ops give you a fighting chance and they beat you or you beat them inch by inch,this game just drops a couple of impossible cards at you and the session is over.
Not good enough as a deckbuilder nor as a thematic experience unfotunately.
I wanted to like it,but it needs some serious work from variants or the designers(doubt it)

RATING: 6
This is an interesting cooperative game, where the players will think as hard as possible about how to win the mission and you will enjoy the defeat more or less, depending on the phase you die. If you fail right at the beginning, bad, if you lose at the second phase, not that bad, well done, if you get to the third level, and die, do not expect any different, very well done guys! Good job! And then just put the game on the shelf until the next time.
Don't get me wrong, I think that the game is interesting but I think that it has not been properly tested. It is extremely difficult, and if this is what the designers were expecting for the game, then they have created the game for those players that enjoy great challenges and that want to try and retry and try again one single mission in order to do everything without any mistake, which is perfect, I do totally respect that, but, it is not what I am looking for in a board game. I just prefer something more casual. Having said that, I will play a couple of rounds if someone wants to play. I like to try to go beyond limits, the game is fine, the artwork is very nice, the list of actions available are very easy and the game is easy to explain and it doesn't take too long to play a single mission (specially if you die right at the beginning)
Positive:
1. Easy to explain
2. The artwork
3. Quick to play
Negative:
1. Extremely difficult
2. Not recommended for every player, specially for those that do not manage defeat well

THE WORST LAYOUT OF CARDS EVER.
(tiny, unclear font; non-distinctive types of cards, abilities, traits etc - cards are just unreadable)

Arbitrary mechanics, odd win conditions, idiotic/uncompelling setting not tied to the mechanical concepts.  
There are _some_interesting ideas buried deep down, but it's too little.  The game as a whole does not convince.

Completely not my cup of tea.  Brrr...

RATING: 6
0/3 on wins. First two weren't even close, the last one I thought I had it made, but a crossfire card staggered 3 of the party. Seems to be a little to random for my tastes, but I'll give it a couple more goes before killing it off.

RATING: 8
One of our favorites. The difficulty can be downright unfair, but it's so quick and fun it's not a big deal to just restart and try again. (I swear we draw Scrybot Tracer every single game, and if you get one of the crossfire cards that makes you flip up more obstacles you might as well just quit right there) 

Leveling up and getting upgrades keeps bringing us back for more, and we haven't even tried the other scenarios yet.

well, this is an impressive concept. A game that punch you in the face almost very time you play, but it is quick, really and is satisfying.

75% of the time? Maybe i win 35% of the time. Thats more accurate. I hate/love this game.

Deckbuilder for 1 to 4 players. Most exciting part of the game is the persistence.

The only downside the game has is that... well, how to put this... when you start the game, you're expecting an entirely different game. If you can't get over those preconceptions then you probably won't enjoy the game. If you can then you will probably have a blast.

Wow, hard as hell. Love the implementation of thematic elements and the mechanics. Basic card deck feels very bland, however. Why is there no special hacking card for the decker?? Mage Knight does it better with one special card for each character. However the very cool market cards make up for it somewhat. Will def. play this very soon and often!

Edit: while the core gameplay is fascinating and challenging, the legacy part of the game just didn'T click with my group. It really takes some grinding to "level up" your character to then be able to "continue" with different missions. The game really should have a campaign mode, but it has not, so it had to go - Dragonfire is on the horizon...

This is the toughest cooperative game in the known Universe. You have to grind the first few games and build up Karma to gain skills in order to even stand half a chance at succeeding a mission. Four players who have extensive experience at working together to achieve set goals in these type of boardgames (30+ wins 0 losses @ Arkham) got crushed repeatedly but persistence furthers in the Sixth World and after 12 games successfully completed the Crossfire mission (just)....now the game is actually enjoyable. I'm a huge Shadowrun fan (owning dozens of the RPG books) but a few flaws drag this down from a perfect 10. Firstly, one must question the extent of playtesting that went into Crossfire, it really needs a training mission of some kind so as not to be the "n00b killa" that it is. As for the stickers...they are a blatant nuyen raising exercise but nothing that can't be worked around, just stick them onto the white card that comes with comic books to make tokens. The paltry three missions are nowhere near enough- game designers only need rely upon excellent gameplay to sell future expansions, this only proves that the team at Catalyst Game Labs knew that they fell well short of the mark, especially given the fact that the included Dragon Hunt Mission is unplayable with less than 70 Karma.

Woah! this game has surprised me. I thought that it was gonna be just another Thunderstone or Legendary deck building game. But man! It is not.

The game have an interesting combat mechanic and the cooperative strategies are very good, you are always talking with your group how to beat the obstacles.

The game is hard as hell as you progress in the scenes and you can have multiple levels of difficulty.

KEEPER SOLO
This is a cheeky, insolent game that I grudgingly admire because the gameplay is the thing, and that's what makes it great. A fast-moving card game to which theme and artwork are knowingly peripheral (you're in a bladerunner, well, whatever, world) and delightfully trashy, with just enough complexity of overall goal, event and obstacle cards to keep you immersed. The theme subverts itself through artwork, flavour text and a backstory that you and the game both know are bollocks. Deservedly popular.

Clever aspects: bought cards go straight into your hand; rewards are shared; good assists; and - important for me -  your runners never die (the mission aborts if they go critical).

Horrendously ugly and oversized box. Recycled mine and keep whichever characters, job cards and decks I'm currently using in the High Ops expansion box (terrific cover art). Works a treat and very portable.

Only game I've sleeved then unsleeved because it detracted from the feel (and smell) of the cards.

Got to have a first run (well two actually) of Shadowrun Crossfire so I wanted to type out my first thoughts:

-First off, this was the first co-op game I actually cared about my team in.  I mean you have games like Pandemic or Arkham Horror where it's more of a discussed strategy anyhow and the concept of turns is only applied in the loosest sense.  But even in games like Shadowrift I rarely have more than a passive interest in what my team is building for a deck - I'm optimizing the shit out of mine but theirs doesn't seem to matter.  Similar in Sentinels of the Multiverse I'll consult my team about objectives I don't know if I can handle personally but beyond that I never really care.  Shadowrun makes you care.  If one member of your team goes down you can't succeed at the run (though you can attempt to survive the abandon the run phase and get a minor reward) and with the Elf having 4 hit points that can happen very quickly!

-Secondly this game has variance in all the right places.  A player's starter deck is but 7 cards (4 of which are identical based on your role/class) and you build a very tailored deck.  But the obstacles you face and the Crossfire deck (bad stuff) makes your strategies useless beyond a certain point.  Not saying you can't plan ahead but often you'll find your plans being changed for you.  Also the variance will change which obstacle is most advantageous to take out at any given time.  Sometimes you want to take out anything for the money to buy a new card for your deck (bought cards go straight into your hand!) sometimes you need to take out a target that threatens to drop a member of your team. 

-Third, quality is king!  The quality of the cards and components is top shelf.  I'm excited for expansions for both more characters, more cards, and more scenarios.  Although the scenarios don't really change much about how the game works it would be interesting to have more than 3 options for an easy/medium/hard type deal.  Also, although the quality of the dry-erase character cards with stickers for level-upgrades is amazing, I've already downloaded and printed paper sheets because a) they feel more like a character sheet and b) I can print enough for everyone :)

All in all this has already supplanted whatever I last claimed was my favorite game and I'm going to spend as much time as possible badgering people to play this.  I can't recommend this highly enough - Five stars!

I love the idea of leveling with a deck builder.  My family is always playing these types of games so we were excited and picked it up at Gencon 2014.  We played a few rounds last night and we had fun playing. I still have hope for the game will become more fun, but it is hard to enjoy the leveling aspect when you get crushed over and over and getting no XP.  I would recommend house ruling a bit to give yourself a fighting chance.  Like wait an extra round of play before playing crossfire cards.  The game is still enjoyable and I think doing a few tweaks to make this fit your group really helps.

I love this game while others hate it with a passion. It can be hard as balls, but then again, many coops are as hard if not harder than this and are usually lauded as the best thing ever since peanut butter. This game can be punishingly hard, and sometimes borderline unfair, but the runs are short, and most of the hurdles can be overcome with experience and planification. Also, it's one of the few games I played so much, its premium sleeves bursted off.

I will definitely give Catalyst Game Labs their due, this is definitely not your run of the mill deck-builder. Crossfire is almost just a stripped down version of Mage Knight board game, with the deckbuilder aspect of that game carved out and a mission timer put on. And the game is really hard. This will definitely be the deck-builder of choice for co-op fans as the team is competing against all manner of creatures that the deck can throw at them. You have to be strategic in how you deal with each threat as many different variables need to be taken into account. The game also ramps up in difficulty as the players are ramping up their skills and equipment through the purchase of cards. I like the idea of characters evolving from game to game, but it seems to me that you should at least get to keep a card or two from your deck if you are successful in your run, but sadly that isn't the case here. 
I will say that I was disappointed with the lack of variety in the cards. I would imagine that an IP like Shadowrun would have a huge slew of art and other things to pull from to make a much fuller core set. 
Overall I am glad I played this game, but I am also very glad that i did not buy it before playing it. This is definitely not a game I ever need to own.

Definitely requires teamwork.  You need to discuss cards/strategy with your teammates to determine how best to approach the obstacles.  Always fun when you find a solution - "if A does X, then I can do Y, B will do Z...bam, obstacle defeated."  It's also not an optimization deckbuilder.  You have to buy the card that works best for the current situation and not in 2 turns when your deck is shuffled.

RATING: 7
Punishingly difficult, this game makes you think several steps ahead. Every game is different, so you can't establish a "winning" pattern; you have to adapt your strategy to the obstacles and crossfire events. The "legacy" character building is cool, but it builds painfully slowly. One of those multiple character games that actually plays much better solo.

Leveling up combined with cooperative deckbuilding is what makes this game a keeper. This is in my husband's favorite game.

It does have a mechanics of a proper co-op game where players actually co-operate with one another.  However, the entire game could be best described as "Match the icons"

This is based on one play of the introduction scenario.  However, it doesn't help the game also has stickers for it's character progression.  They could've used easily used a pad or cards to show character progression.  It makes the resale value of this game plummet if you want to get rid of it.

This is probably the game I've played the most in my collection. It's just so good, solo or with multiple players. It's fairly easy to explain, but you need to think a lot to maximize your odds of winning. The game can be ruthless if you're too greedy or make small mistakes. 

I highly recommend it

RATING: 7
Quite addictive as a solo game. Hard and frustrating like a good solo or co-op game should be. It´s a very puzzly game of matching icons, so I´m a bit hesitant to try it multiplayer. As for theme or storyline, it just isn´t there. Sure, there are text and pictures on the cards, but fighting the obstacles is just matching icons and the random event cards are just...random. Can´t wait to play again solo, and will try it multi-player eventually and will see how that turns out.

Bought at Kingslayer Comics 5/9/16 w/50% off loyalty discount.

Character evolution is great to see, especially with the additional options in the expansion.  I wish there was a linear campaign with complete story, but the side missions do make it easier to play single missions and still have that sense of development.  Each mission is definitely tense, and there is qutie a bit of luck in the card draw.  But somehow, I'm okay with that - the game is incredibly difficult, but that makes it so much more rewarding when we do win.  The co-op nature of the game is great, but I do wish that the classes/races were a bit more asymmetric.

Je le soupçonne d'être bon vraiment qu'à 4 joueurs (et 3 ?). Individuellement nos actions possibles sont assez pauvres et guère intéressantes. L'intérêt se situe essentiellement dans la coopération (tant mieux pour un jeu coopératif !) car il est possible d'attaquer un ennemi sur un autre joueur, et ici apparaissent les vrais choix stratégiques.
Le système de progression et son côté semi legacy est une vaste blague.

Good: 
I am a fan of the Shadow Run theme. 
Great artwork helps the theme of the game. 
Selectable and upgradeable characters. Races have starting stats, professions determine starting deck, and you can earn karma to customize characters. 

Bad: 
There are too many random spikes in difficulty for this to be engaging. You can flip over encounter cards that the party simply has no chance of winning against resulting in a random loss/flee. There is potential here, but I am not sure why they didn't even out the encounter decks more.

One learning 2p player in and ordered the character expansion pack 1 because I want all the options when I head back and start to track stats. Imma write all over those cards, stickers and all!

Adding on to original rating:
After multiple plays over two days (8 plays to be exact), I can say I really enjoy this game. Only played two player with each player playing one character and two roles each. I enjoy it this way because it gives more of the rpg feel with the character I am controlling being me in the SR universe. However, we have only won the ambulators scenario and made one successful abort during a crossfire mission. All other plays have resulted in a pummeling. After reading some more I may try each of us controlling two characters each to improve our win ratio but I really don't want to take away from the immersion that playing one character provides.

Still just leveling up my players enough to be able to win the crossfire mission (though I've managed 4 of 5 safe extractions) that said, it's the perfect SUPER fast solo card-based deck builder/dungeon crawler heavy on the tactical gameplay. Could be a bit better balanced to get into it (apparently the expansion helps in that regard) but I enjoy every second of the 20 min gameplay and usually play multiple times in a sitting. 

Update: Dropped score a bit. This ultimately never really developed for me. Nice quick solitaire game with thinky decisions

I was so excited by this, but really let down.  I enjoyed the first demo, but when I played it again, it just felt like Uno.  The game ends up consisting of people saying "I've got a red, do you have a green you can play?"  Blargh.  Compared to the Pathfinder game it was sad.

[microbadge=1714]

04-Oct-2015:  Shadowrun: Crossfire is a deckbuilding game based on the original RPG, Shadowrun.  And I must say….great, great game.  The two main things that folks seem to focus on are the luck and the difficulty. In terms of luck, this game doesn’t have any more or less than any other, similar style card game I’ve played (Friday, Legendary Marvel, Ascension). It’s a deck of cards, several actually. At some point, the cards will completely go against you and then they will completely favor you. But for the majority of the time, it will fall somewhere in the middle. 

For difficulty, I feel there is a learning curve involved. The game is tough. I lost my first eight games, but I’ve now won the last three in a row. I believe the difficulty here is in learning how [i]not[/i] to play it like a standard deckbuilder. In Shadowrun, you’ll only be adding a few new cards to your deck.  Every purchase you make will directly affect the outcome of your game. And buying the “best” card in the offer will not get you a win. You need to strategize how best to accomplish your goal while still thinking about what’s to come.

And. It. Is. Awesome.

Okay, I feel I should give at least one negative here. Narrative. Or story. There is almost none in this game. Yes, you’ll definitely have an emotional ride of ups and downs in terms of survival and success, but the Obstacles, Events, and Missions are completely unconnected to each other. Now, I’ve tried to counter that somewhat buy doing some very minor roleplaying. I’ve created a bit of a backstory for my two Runners. And for each mission that we’ve gone on, I’ve tried to come up with some flavor text to give it a more personal feel.

A very preliminary rating after around 10 plays. This looks to be a pretty divisive game. So far I am enjoying the intense puzzle solving and Risk Legacy-esque upgrade system, but it must be noted that the game does feel VERY swing-y. All co-ops rely on luck to provide consistent pleasure; however, it's still too early to tell if this game gives players enough options to mitigate unlucky draws. For now, the challenge is addictive.

Deck-builders are quickly becoming tired, but if more games can do new things with the concept like Crossfire and Core Worlds, the genre might have a chance of staying viable. I hope it does, because I love this game, although it's in dire need of additional content to keep it fresh.

Needs a lot of house rules for it to be fun for board gamers.  It's more for Shadowrun RPGamers and get them into board games.  

Had to add more house rules to get the decks built up so that you could actually get past one of the missions later on.  

PtACG is still better.

Based on only 2 plays of the game, I really liked it... I usually don't like Co-Op games because of the Alpha Player (usually me) but the "difficulty" of the game and the amount of choices we have in the approach of each player turn is so ample that we actually work has a 4 man team to hatch the best plan... and that's pretty darn cool!

I wish there were a bigger variety in the cards of the Black Market because I think we have already scene them all, we haven't used all of them but we have scene all...
But obviously this game will have expansions so there's a lot to come down the road!

Really Hard with 4 players to the point of not being very fun. 2 players it was great and still difficult. With the 4 player game we ended up starting everybody out with 5 karma, it really helped push ahead into the fun zone. I love it, just gets repetitive if you are grinding. Not enough card variations to start out with. I would have paid double the price to have game expanding cards included.

A different take on the deck-building mechanic, where you carry over unused cards from hand to hand. And you level up from one game to the next, by earning karma. Might become a favorite.

Wow, so much to love, but just a little bit to hate.  I think this is a super immersive experience.  Really thoughtful mechanics and a well-developed universe.  Great in a group, or a solo experience.  Such great tension and super interesting card interactions.  I simply LOVE this game.  The minor hate?  Well it is simply brutally unforgiving.  I have heard people say you can "just cheat" and have a better experience not getting slaughtered (especially as a noob trying to pick up on all the subtle strategies and intense number crunching that can be involved in order to have a good chance of even beating the game half the time!)  But I do not want to play a game simply to "cheat."  I want to feel like I have a chance playing things straight up.  So a BIG hint to these amazing developers for their next project (or S:C 2.0):  take a page out of the best high learning curve video games and many board games and have a beatable introductory scenario.  There is such awesome permanence this game offers.  You can really become attached to your character as he levels up, just like in the best RPGs.  But who wants to get creamed right out of the gate and have a DOA squad, while earning NO experience???  Just my 2 cents

I absolutely love this game. I'm a little surprised that it didn't come with the Legacy moniker, because that's essentially what it is.

A wonderful deck building game. Some people argue that it is too tough or that there is too much random luck involved.

I argue that life is sometimes unfair, so why must our games always be so? I enjoy a little random chaos in games. Even with all the bad luck, with experience you can overcome it quite often. Experience teaches when to spend, when to hold a card and what card to buy. 

I absolutely love this game by itself, but the aspect of the game where you can level up your character puts it on top of all other deck building games for me. Another huge plus is how quickly it plays.  Maybe this is why the losses and bad luck do not bother me so, since I know I can bang out another game in 15 minutes.

Clever progression based deckbuilder, though I feel some monster flips are random and just unwinnable. Still enjoy the cleverness within its design, though I don't care for its sci-fi esque thematic parts. Its speed is another great strength, and I really like that aspect. 

I just wish I didn't have to shuffle the deck, which is the bane of most deckbuilders for me. Still excellent game.

RATING: 6
This game surprised me a bit. Didn't really expect anything of this but the mechanics work very well here. I have the paper & pen rpg Shadowrun.

Pros:

 - Theme is cool (if you like it) - Science fantasy
 - Player roles, decks and combat mechanics work REALLY well here
 - Simple and neat rules
 - Fast and tense gameplay
 - Awesome art
 - Fun
 - Very challenging co-op (after five or six games, only two mission successes with flying colors)

Cons:

 - Weird theme (if you don't like it)
 - The stickers are weird and don't work
 - Too few missions in the box... no campaign
 - Gets repetitive with the same few missions
 - Missions have little or no story, this is a mechanical card game, don't expect any deep rpg elements here

2017 UPDATED from 8 to 6:
- After more plays this game is too hard. It is extremely hard to win and it takes too many missions to gain karma with aborts.
- Healing is too difficult/rare. Only a few cards allows healing if you even get lucky enough to get them from the deck. This will lead into a death spiral when obstacles gets more difficult and your team get more and more beaten.
- This game is way too random. It's all about the luck of the draw from any deck.

I will not play this again without some house ruling. I would apply more karma from the start. Get some upgrades from the get-go. Also some rules about healing is mandatory, maybe heal 1 when you kill an obstacle, heal full between scenes etc.

Shadowrun: Crossfire has a great cooperative element, but very little deckbuilding. A player might only add 3 cards to their deck in the course of a game. Gameplay is pretty theme-less and basically cooperative symbol matching. Also, despite the game being playable with 2 or 3 players it shouldn't be played with less than 4.

Fell pretty flat for me. The deckbuilding aspect is only for each individual run. Individual players hardly feel unique as they only contribute a different distribution of icons. Very susceptible to quarterbacking. I would like to see expansions that can contribute to....

A) more uniqueness between players

B) less randomness for challenge (more of a escalating difficulty curve rather than random spikes)

C) a deckbuilding aspect that grows with your character ( at its core the ShadowRun franchise is an RPG...character development is a must!

D) structured campaigns/runs with certain sets of enemies and challenges for theme. (I want to feel like i'm going on a shadowrun not fighting random enemies in a dungeon!)

For some reason this game has just clicked with me I play it solitaire using two characters. It has surspringly few cards compared to ther DBGs but because of the nature of the game using scenarios it still keeps it totally fresh and very challenging ...that said I would buy many many expansions at the drop of a hat ...so please print some more asap ...I need my expansion addiction feeding ...please help me !

I really want to like this game more, but when it boils down to it the overall game play is rather shallow.

It can only be effectively played with four player; the boxes say 1-4, but that is like saying chess can be played with five players - it just requires everyone to move a piece every 5th turn. In a three player Crossfire game, one of the players just plays two characters!

It is effectively a suit matching game with some extremely limited deck building (the decks only lasts one game, and in that game you will probably only get 4-5 extra cards added to the classes vanilla starting deck).

It has an (very) limited upgrade system. Based on our experience, anything past the first upgrade - which takes about 3-6 hours to get - will take you weeks of play sessions to get.

The game mechanics have no risk-reward mechanics to balance of the completely random nature of the card draws/difficulty. The system has no pay-off if you draw enemies (Obstacles) of the same type/colour, this makes the “round” much hard.

Some of the “comments” (I think they must be advertorials), mention they like the hardness of the game; but this is not hard it is just random. If you get a draw that matches the enemies to the players, you will win easily, whereas the opposite is completely impossible to win (regardless of the players’ skill).

Also the playing cards are extremely cheaper stock/finish. The box is crazy big for the included components too; probably so people don’t feel ripped off.

If you love Shadowrun; play the RPG or the computer game, not this! If you love co-op deck-building games; player Pathfinder, not this! if you love co-op uber-punishing (but fun) card games; play Space Hulk: Death Angel, not this!

This is a fun idea for a co-op deckbuilder that's too randomly hard for it's own good. I say randomly hard because it's the randomness of card flips that ends you as opposed to it being a nice puzzle to solve. Part of the problem is we tried having one of each character type, and the elf character just doesn't have enough hit points to make it through act 2 of 3 in the opening quest. The idea is this, each player has a deck of cards. Each round, everybody gets an obstacle card that will hurt them at the end of their turn. Then, an event flips that helps or hurts, and then players play cards from their hand in specific orders to destroy any of the obstacles, even the ones in front of other players. It's a fantastic idea. I just don't see any way to win this. 

There is a system for "leveling up" that seems really odd. You can keep your character between games. You get 1xp for failing, so when you fail 5 times, you can get a little skill that helps you not lose as much. The skills range in xp cost from 5 to 30. I suspect the secret to enjoying the game is to use these skills at the start and just pretend the characters are higher level, but then how do we balance that so the game doesn't become too easy? The characters didn't stand out to me in this game to me. Everyone has access to all the skills, so it's not like a descent level up tree. I don't understand why the leveling is part of the game design, other than maybe Pathfinder Adventure did it and they wanted to compete with them?

Never experienced the Shadowrun theme and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it (check out PC game: Dragonfall, fun indie game). 

This is a tactical game and that means lots of luck. Ultimately, between that and the lack of depth in gameplay I realized this wasn't for us.

Demoed at Origins, a somewhat bland deckbuilder. If you're into Shadowrun it might push all the right buttons, but for me it was sorta boring and not complex enough to stay interested.

Do you have 3 of a color in your hand? Great, how about 2 of another color? No? Then the dude will hit you next time. You do? Yay, he's dead, you get some money, and another dude shows up. z

I've had about 10 or so games of this so far in a group of 4 over about a month, and we've kinda decided never to play it again.

Winning in this game is purely luck of the draw as more often than not you will get creamed.  The scenarios are poorly set up.  The client extraction for example throws so many obstacles your way that if you don't clear them immediately, you will not succeed.

Punctuate that with the "Crossfire" cards that can just burn you.  There was one that was so offensive and would almost be an instant loss at any time it was drawn that we "lost it" immediately.  Something like "take damage equal to cards in your hand"

It's a deck building game...

I would be leary of anybody rating this high, because this game is purely punitive.

You probably buy 2-3 cards to your boring starter deck.

Firstly I really like the artwork and theme with this one. So a plus if you like a blade runner type setting.

I have never got into straight up deck builders as the mechanics don't appeal to me but I wanted to give this one a go. I like the quick setup and fact you can evolve your characters and I think the game is quite easy to learn.

The game is brutally difficult though. The obstacles you draw can make or break you beyond your strategy. A quick look at my owned list would highlight I enjoy difficult games but here a single bad draw will see you dead in minutes.

This is countered somewhat by the quick setup and play time but it still feels like the game can spike in difficulty quite quickly.

If I want a quick play of something though this is a good option!

Not exactly what I was hoping for. Puzzle style abstract card game with some random card draws and deck building in the mix. Huge miss on the theme and story telling elements you could have in this game. "Campaign" and leveling up is just grinding the same scenarios over and over again which is the biggest problem above all.

Xmas 2014 present for the wife.  4 2 player games in on Boxing Day and have to say this is fun, but not blow your socks off fun.  
Setup is quick and game play feels a bit like a puzzle, where success is based on your ability to work together to keep everyone alive and ensuring the greatest threat is taken care off.
On first glance, this is nothing special. The deck building is fairly minimal, your choices appear obvious. It's the perpetual character development which will keep you interested.

RATING: 6
Based off 3 plays (1 solo, 2 x 2 player) so far.

I do like the cyberpunk theme. Also the card art is nice and the card stock is decent. Box is sturdy enough and has enough room for expansions. No complaints about the components at all.

I think this is an interesting co-op deckbuilder game. Combine a race with a class and get your team together. Go on missions together and level up by buying karma upgrades. All a good premise, especially if you can get a regular group together. The game plays well, though some rules take a few games before you get them right. And getting a rule wrong can change the difficulty of a mission way up or way down.

If I have a complaint about the game, it is about the initial difficulty. It's INSANE. Seriously, just way too hard. I understand people like it since, thematically, the lives of inexperienced runners is cheap and they'd be expected to struggle. But when you're not invested in the background of the game and you just want a "fair" gaming experience with your first try or two - this game doesn't give you it. It's incredibly tough and unforgiving. By all means, I encourage players to try it - then just give in and give each starting player their choice of a 5 karma upgrade to start out. A lack of variety of mission types is another minor complaint. Though missions are different enough with the spread of black market cards and obstacles you'll encounter. Just picked up the High Caliber Ops expansion - hopefully the new missions are different enough there.

Overall, I think it can be a decently fun deckbuilder. It does require interaction between the players about how to overcome things. The initial difficulty does put me off a bit, but I'm hopeful that the game will get better if our characters can get a little more survivable. I'd intend to revisit this review after trying again with a free 5 karma upgrade for everyone to start.

This game is insanely difficult. The included missions are a good way to turn people off from playing this. What kind of starting mission expects you to lose so many times just to get karma (experience points)?? For a deckbuilder, it seems stupid that to play another mission you start with the same cards at the start of every game? It is not thematic at all! Why would you not be able to use what you gained from previous missions? Thumbs down in every way.

The difficulty of the game is high, but that's part of the appeal.  I think that if it was possible to beat it more often, it would not bring out the urge to go back and tackle it once more.  On top of the great gameplay and theme, it also has a campaign mode where your characters can receive upgrades.  Brilliant!

[q="sniktsnikt"]you dont get paid in the middle of a run. you demand half up front and hope the mr. johnson doesn't screw you out of the other half. you don't gear up in the middle of the run, you take the half up front find a back alley doc to implant wired reflexes in the troll street samurai and pray you dont need more firepower than the Ares Predator knock offs the face bought from a friend of a guy of a friend he knows.[/q]

Yeah, I found it bizarre that while we were trying to shoot things, we had opportunity to buy more cards. It's like there's a vending machine in the hallway we were fighting in or something. 

I also didn't get why I was fighting a light drone at the same time another player was going against a techno wizard and another against a holo-jaguar or something. It's like Disneyland with random stuff popping up. If I'm going on a mission against someone, I'd expect some sort of coherence or explanation of why the... what were we overall fighting, anyway? It never felt like we were going against some overall organization, just a bunch of different chrome.

If anyone remembers Steve Jackson Game's SPANC (Space Pirates Amazon Ninja Catgirls), theme was similar. You'd first be pushing a heavy rock to get into a cave, then infiltrating a pool boy convention, then fighting off ninjas. However, this (sort of) worked because SPANC was a silly game, parodying the incoherency of anime and cartoons with their arbitrary and unexplained smooshing of popular tropes. Shadowrun asks us to take this sort of thing, in this case, all that cool postmodern cyberstuff, seriously.

In only tried the intro scenario, I'll ask my friend to make some "pregenerated" characters so I can try some advanced gameplay. But, for now, I'm glad I tried the game before buying it. I actually have the old Shadowrun CCG, which felt more like a "run", and particularly like the bluffing mechanic (playing a face-down obstacle card), although sometimes the obstacles didn't always make sense with the objectives, either.

[q="rahdo"]That is, a session of Crossfire isn't representing one simple quick escalating fight, but probably a 10 or 12 hour span of time in the lives of your characters.  [/q]

Thematically, that would make sense, but, at least in the intro game I played, the cards in no way suggested this happening. 

At least in Arkham Horror, you have locations where you went, and encounters you had. So if SC had event cards (or whatever those escalating threat cards were) that said "You go to the Chop Shop to recover your wounds", that would at least fit with your explanation of what was happening.

But... NOPE. The escalating threat cards are abstract, not thematically explaining what's going on. I really did think it the cards represented an escalating fight because these threat cards... escalated.

There's also no feeling that you've done the job, unless the flavor text prologue said it. And, if I'm doing the job, where are these credits for my pursuers coming from? Shouldn't I have been paid the job that I'm fleeing the repercussions from?

I'll also agree with OP that I don't like losing all my cards. Thematically, I guess my character is a numbnuts fumblefingers who drops all of his stuff at the end of the fight. Or maybe these electronic nunchuck crowbars I picked up have a limited use. Mebbe they're black market weapons made by the Oriental Trading Company or something.

But, speaking of crowbars, if I have to come up with a thematic explanation that the equivalent of one, that's a failure to thematically implement a game.

Game is difficult to pick up and requires a significant amount of co-operation on the part of the players.

Even if the rules were gotten down pat, quite frankly it's pretty boring - play cards to match numbers and colours, asking for help when needed, buy new cards for your deck. Wash, rinse, repeat. There are deck builders that use combat that are much more exciting - see Arctic Scavengers.

There may be a game in here but it's asking to much of a commitment from myself and other players to get it.

:d6-1: must have this, solo and for hubby, he really enjoys Shadowrun. In our small apartment, having games do double duty is excellent!

Update: I've read it's hard to play this solo 4 handed, which is what you need to do to win much. Two handed is easier, but you will lose a ton. I don't know that anyone three hands it. I think I would probably always two hand it, it's not worth the extra hassle. If that isn't a playable way, then maybe it's not the solo game for me.  However, my husband and I would play together. So I guess I need to read more, or find out more.

This game felt pretty brutal, but not in a particularly fair way.

We did have a pretty exciting final turn or two, but it mostly just felt like chance.

A game that is a hard co-op deck builder should be something that I'm likely to rate highly, but this one has a few things that bug me too much for me to really enjoy it. I get what they were trying to do with the whole leveling up thing, but I feel like the game would have been better off without it. "Oh, I have to keep losing so I can get an upgrade sticker so I might have a better chance." It's kinda lame. I'm also not a fan of how you start from scratch with your deck every game. Cannot even keep a single card. Sorta feel that this should have been where the character progression should have been. Higher level characters should start with some better cards. idk, I'll play the game here and there, but I'd rather play Alien/Predator Legendary instead.

A deck builder that requires careful co-ordination between players as to how and when they play their respective cards. 

The use of karma ("experience points") to allow a player's chosen character to grow from game to game is very nice, though it can be hard to come by as the game  will regularly chew you up and spit you out.  But when you beat it, the feeling is great.

After watching Rahdo's acclaim of this game I bumped it up on the priority list and bought it recently. I tried explaining the general premise to some people and no one has been interested so I have soloed this game 5 times playing 2 characters at one time which isn't all that fun. The worst part is the last 3 games I have got my butt whooped which earns no karma and I can't buy new specialties to make my 2 characters any better. I will probably play this game again since it isn't hard to solo but the awe and wonder I had going into it of building up a character over a year of playing is gone.

A new spin on co-op deckbuilders: players each takes on a role which allows them to focus on a certain type of deck to build.

Players play cards to defeat obstacles by matching symbols. Defeating obstacles gives money used to buy more cards. Decks are compact enough to know what's coming and to have some clever use of combos.

There's a campaign game where you can use 'karma' points for your characters to buy upgrades. The problem with the game is that if you play with complete open information/discussion the game just ends up being an exercise in most efficient problem solving.

Co-op deckbuilder.

Played twice back-to-back at BGGcon 2015. Disappointed. Co-op or solo games should be challenging but the intro scenario on this one is mathematically too hard. You MUST get lucky on some opposition draws to not get wiped out, I think.

For example, we were drawing obstacles that required 4+ symbols per hit to defeat, with 3-6 hits each. Well, with a hand size of just 3-4 cards it is mathematically impossible to adequately deal with obstacles like that before taking too much damage.

Frustrating experience.

A wonderful deckbuilder, great replayability, nice quick and eventful playing experience. the game is very challenging, at least as a two-player game (I didnt play 4-player). even after trying out various strategies and having read the rules carefully I only win like every 5th time.

after levelling up your characters (with every win or successful abort you win karma-points) shadowrun gets even better! the new abilities you buy with your karma points and the scaling of difficulty by adding more obstacles make the game deeper the more you advance. shadowrun crossfire is definitely my favourite 2-player-coop-game.

i’m looking forward to play the expansion!

RATING: 9
A suspenseful and fast-paced cooperative deck-builder with a legacy component involving character progression. While this game does not offer a more thematic experience than other deck builders, it does provide silky smooth and compulsive gameplay. Overall, I really enjoy the pacing and balance between the players and the obstacles provided by the game. Unlike other cooperative games, characters don't ramp up until they predictably crush the game. Nor does the game run away with it from the outset. Rather, it feels like players and the game are well balanced as long as you make smart choices. The game is not forgiving of mistakes! Also, unlucky draws from the event deck can sometimes be demoralizing, but if you persevere you can occasionally pull a win from the jaws of defeat. Fluid and quick play make it difficult not to want to play a few sessions in a row. Overall, my favorite cooperative deck-builder.

Játszottam régen Shadowrun szerepjátékot így nagy várakozás előzte meg a játékot. Kaptam egy sima deckbuildinget, amiben az ellenfelek megölése és maga a különböző célok az újdonság tulajdonképpen. Tetszett, ahogy az ellenfeleket likvidálnunk kell. Nem életerejük van, hanem egyes kombókat kell összehoznunk a különböző fajtájú kártyákból a megölésükhöz. Az egyes játékok különbözőségét a szkenáriók adják, amiből ha jól tudom csak három van az alapjátékban, ami nem tűnik soknak. Tetszett az assist megoldás, amivel egyes kártyákat kölcsönadhatunk a társainknak, mert ugye a Shadowrun esetében egy full koop deckbuildinggel van dolgunk. A grafikáktól annyira nem voltam elragadtatva és úgy érzem lehetett volna jobban megcsinálni, hogy a világ jobban átjöjjön a játékban (pl. az egyes kasztok különbözősége nem igazán különül el). Nem rossz játék, de nem is éreztem kiemelkedőnek. Látni kellene a többi szkenáriót is az objektív pontozáshoz. A pontszámot egy játék után hoztam.

I like this but it's so difficult before you've gained any skills that the game is essentially broken the first few times you play. I also found the rules pretty pretty written/confusing to get through the first time since there are some pretty major differences between this and a standard deck-builder that aren't really pointed out or explained very clearly in the rulebook (at least not on my first read through).

I also found that I would often have turns where there was just literally nothing I could do. Which is frustrating.

Solo-able deckbuilder with character progression

RATING: 6
After 20+ plays and adding the High Caliber Ops expansion, downgraded rating from 8 to 7 and now to a 6. Lots to like about this game, including a solo play time around an hour or less. Theme is fun, art is great and card combos can be quite nice. I like the legacy aspect of developing characters, but progression is painfully slow.

Unfortunately, the game often throws a curve that you just can't come back from. This is a largely reactionary game but sometimes all your planning and prep gets tossed by a card draw and you're left flat-footed with no way to recover.

This is a cooperative deck building game with persistent player abilities.  Much like a combination of something like Legendary and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.

In this game each player has a deck of cards and a character.  The character dictates the player's starting life, hand size, and money and the cards in a player's deck each have symbols that dictate which challenges they can damage.

On a player's turn they have obstacles with different sets of symbols showing which damage type is needed to defeat them.  Players take turns playing cards to try to defeat these obstacles and at the end of their turn spend money to buy new cards into their deck with even more symbols and often special abilities as well.

I like the symbol matching mechanics and they are incredibly accessible and easy to teach and understand.  I also really like the fantasy cyberpunk world of Shadowrun.  The one thing I do wish is that the characters were more diverse in their starting makeup.  Every elf, human, dwarf, troll, and orc has the same starting makeup.  I wish they actually had differing starting powers to make your choice of character more impactful and varied other than a piece of art and the same starting resources as every other character of that race.

There is also a persistence feature where after a run players earn "karma" which is essentially experience points they use to buy new abilities for their character. 

I also think the amount of content in the starting game is a little bare.  There are only 4 adventures and even the variety in the black market deck (where you buy new cards for your deck) doesn't have as many options as I would like.  They plan to release expansions but that doesn't help out of the gate where you can only really get 4 plays out of it without having to repeat missions which can get a little boring.  And plays of this game are reasonably short on top of that (especially if you lose).  Not to mention this game hasn't received a lot of buzz so if this translates to not selling a lot of copies there may be no expansions for it after all.

All in all with games like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Descent and its ilk, and the Legacy system games all offering that neat persistence feature this game offers and tons of cooperative card builders available as well I just don't see a place for this game that doesn't seem to have a lot of legs.  The persistence is there to offer replayability but without content also to make each future play interesting there is a big disconnect there.

Fun card-game thematic puzzle. Hard, and you need a bit of luck, but it feels like good play will get you close.

The game is pretty forgettable.  I played it in two sessions with a few missions each session.  But now, a few months later, I cannot really remember much about it.  I remember it was tough, I remember it was somewhat thematic (meaning that the cards and such were suitable to the mission, but I did not get the feeling of being on the mission that me and the party were on).

RATING: 7
Despite some forum complaints to the contrary, this one is quite winnable and provides an enjoyable play experience at 2, 3, or 4 players. I also really enjoy this one as a solo game, playing 2 characters simultaneously.

Leveling up will take a long time. Sticker management is a bit gimmicky. But play how you want and you'll likely have fun. If you don't like the stickers, write things on a character sheet. If you don't want to play enough games to fully level up for that advanced mission, just skip ahead.

There are a few crossfire cards that can basically end your game if they come out at the wrong time. Game difficulty can vary wildly because of this. But some of my more satisfying games have been the ones where we were sure that last card just killed us, but we pulled it off anyway.

Win or lose, the basic scenario should take less than an hour for 4 players. So the occasional swing of bad luck is acceptable to me.

Amazing.  This game has it all if you enjoy card games in even the slightest. Maybe even if you don't enjoy card games.

It is very elegant. It is not loaded down with extra rules, has minimal contradictions(unlike most other card games) and there are very few things to keep track of.  It is simple and fast.  I now understand elegance as I never had before.  

Regarding replay-ability:  This game would be amazing without any leveling up or persistence from game to game. It would be just like Dominion.  It is a wonderful example of a co-op deckbuilding game.  The ability to level up really lends itself to the theme of repeated plays, constantly running from these bad guys and just gives the game an AMAZING feel.  I love the theme of this game.  I love the universe, the sci-fi universe of running from the bad guys.  The game really re-creates this feeling as you go from turn to turn, taking shots around the corner at these enemies, evading them for long enough to find a dealer and buy some more weapons or items(black market) and then they soon find you again and are taking more shots at you.

It is very hard, and sometimes random, but that fits in well enough with the theme to me.  Randomly drawing the "wrong card" can easily be explained thematically by any number of reasons.  Maybe you couldn't use that gun because you didn't bring it, or it jammed or were low on bullets or you dropped it, etc.  This is represented thematically by just not having drawn it this turn.  Thematically, the black market represents a dealer that you are working with who only happens to have a few weapons each game(imagine working with a new dealer every game, he happens to be in your area of escape).  So this one dealer, of course he isn't going to have every weapon under the sun to choose from, it kinda would be a random deal finding a black market dealer in real life because they have what they could get their hands on, and when their inventory is low, they replace it.  So thematically, the game makes sense and if you think about it in these terms, the difficulty doesn't bother me.  Heck, in other board games, you lose half the time to a human, so why are people so upset that the game is too hard?  Is it because they lost to a deck of cards?  Maybe people like this cannot get the theme into their heads.  Even if they couldn't, I guess they don't like life very much either, because similar to this game, we don't really have any control over our lives.  Soldiers who die from a shot in the back and never saw it coming cannot complain about life being unfair, but we complain when a card is turned up about how unfair it is because we couldn't prepare properly for it?  Seriously, maybe some people are OCD and just want to play board games that they can have a bunch more control over, but personally, I LOVE this controlled randomness chaotic change of pace.  However, while the theme does make sense if you think about it, it isn't quite dripping with theme such as doomrock does.

The bottom line is that if you enjoy Dominion(or any deckbuilding), and you enjoy RPG's, you will absolutely LOVE this game.  If you don't enjoy either of those things, you may not like this game but it is so unique and elegant it is worth a try.  I would only say not to buy this game unless you strongly dislike challenges, Dominion, or co-op games.

In Crossfire you agonise over every card play. You only draw a few, and you only buy a few during the game. The cards you buy go straight into your hand - so you'll buy cards that doesn't really fit in your deck just to save someones life. You have to discuss with everyone about what you are doing, or you'll all fail. It is brutal.

I would like to rate this 8, but with only 3 missions and a difficulty that is just too brutal, I had to bump it down a notch.
I expect the High-Caliber Ops expansion will raise this to a 8 for me.
Base game is still an 7.  Tons of fun!

Edit:  Turns out the other mission (the one with "The Client") isn't so hard!  The one they tell you to start on is way harder!

RATING: 6.8
A fairly charming co-op where, for reasons I'm not entirely sure, it is easy to overlook the shortcomings of the design. The co-op element is mostly a case of puzzling through all of the ways to play out your cards and I'm pretty certain that, with competent play, success is entirely determined by the card draw.

So, a bit shit but oddly fun.

I've no idea how the levelling up works; we died both times.

I've only played this solo, but playing as all four players...and they don't recommend this. It's a little too much. I think I'm just not a fan of this type of fight game, so I'm not giving a good or bad rating. The Good: Very strategic, and it's an interesting tension where you get better offensively and run out of health at the same time. I like the theme and the background books given, that's a nice touch. The Not So Good: aside from the type of game it is, I found the idea of constantly going to the black market in the middle of a fight non-thematic and weird, but in terms of abstract rules it works.

:thumbsup: Great with 2 players or solo controlling 2 characters. That's the only way I ever get to play, and my wife and I are fully satisfied with how it plays at this player count. It must be even better with more people.
:thumbsup: Strong co-op player interaction due to assist cards, synergies in character upgrades, ability to attack any obstacle on your turn, and the fact that the puzzle can be hard to solve all by yourself.
:thumbsup: Very high replayability already in the base game. There are 80 unique enemies that will be boosted by 50 unique crossfire events, and that's on top of a large stack of black market cards used to actually build your decks. The game also comes with multiple game modes.
:thumbsup: A long-term character upgrade system provides extra replayability and motivation to win missions. It's rather slow however, as earning Karma is by no means easy.
:thumbsup: Hard and suspenseful, with adjustable difficulty to make it even harder as you become more experienced. The extra challenges you can take are different from mission to mission and allow you to gain more Karma if you win.
:thumbsup: [thing=180049][/thing] packs even more variety in a small and affordable box. It doesn't add unnecessary complexity, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the base game.
:thumbsup: At first I found the Shadowrun universe a little silly, but I must say it grew on me. As a matter of fact, now I like it more than a generic fantasy theme, so I won't be getting [thing=226501][/thing] anytime soon. Shadowrun just has more [i]character[/i]. And the theme really comes out in this game. Card art, flavour text, brutal difficulty – all come together to create a Shadowrun experience that I don't get from any other game. Plus the game comes with a whole seperate book of lore about the Shadowrun universe.

:?block: The difficulty of a single game can fluctuate a lot. Depending on the setup shuffle it can vary from relatively harmless to practically impossible. It's rare to get the extremes of course, and overall it's quite consistent. But it doesn't feel unfair, because even in a difficult setup your decisions have a high impact on the outcome.
:?block: Stickers work perfectly fine. There're enough of them in the box, and if a lot of different people play your copy, you can always get a Character Expansion Pack. I also have zero problems with using a black dry erase marker on the laminated player boards.
:?block: Some missions can only be realistically attempted with 4 players. Extra missions are just a bonus however, they provide different game modes.
:!block: A couple of key rules are easy to overlook, and it can break the game's difficulty if you do (e.g., drawing Crossfire Events in the Extraction mission). The rulebook is not the best, but BGG and official FAQ do fill any gaps. The rules are also easy to remember once you've learnt them, and card text is typically very straightforward.
:!block: Overall, the game can be extremely hard for new players who both can't play very well yet and don't have any character upgrades. Either keep trying until you learn and start succeeding (like we did), or just give everyone 5-10 Karma to start with.

I wanted to like this game... and there are some good core concepts there... but the set design itself is very poor.

Game Design is one thing, game development is another... and whoever designed the set clearly made some zero hour decisions.

Also, the game was clearly designed for 4 players, and the scaling to 2-3 players is... weak.  The entire balance is thrown off. :(

I really love actual Shdowrun on the tabletop... Shadowrun returns and its modules were super fun... I even sort of enjoyed the jank you FPS... Point I'm making is I like this franchise enough I'll cut installments a lot of flak... But this game is unplayable.
It's WAY too hard,,plotting your way through turns to win is long and agonizing discussing who can do what, but the game technically forbids you from when doing this... And let me tell you, winging it on vagueries? Can't be done
Even if you can win, there's no victory... The level up legacy element is so minor it hardly helps, yet the missions get harder as they go. Even clearing a mission I felt relief I was done and nothing else. The game is dull and a chore, avoid like a Johnson with a high notoriety, omae

A decent game marred by lack of replayability and completely imbalanced encounter difficulty. 3 scenarios isn't enough to sustain this game past maybe 4-5 plays, and the rate at which you accumulate the karma needed to play the higher difficulty scenarios is ridiculous. Could you cheat and give yourself all of the necessary karma? Sure, but what's the point?

The missions are hard, yes, but that's because your team of runners is taking on a mission they're not experienced enough for yet. The grind, the repetition, is all a part of the theme, if you've ever played the Shadowrun RPG. Meet Johnson, do legwork, fulfill mission, get money, rinse and repeat. Complete with leveling up and ways to tweak mission difficulty, Shadowrun: Crossfire offers a fun, balanced, customizable challenge.

I hadn't heard anything about this game beforehand, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. This looked like something that I wasn't positive would appeal to me so much.

Shadowrun:Crossfire is a cooperative deck building game. It's set in the Shadowrun universe which apparently is a mix of tech and magic, with Elves, Dwarves, Trolls and "Orks" but with modern weapons. You have a hand of cards, which deal different types of damage points (generic, spell, weapons, hacking, etc.) Generally, there are enemies front of each player and the goal is to kill all the enemies without anyone dying.

Enemies have different stages you have to beat... so you might need to deal five damage to beat the first level.... but you have to be able to completely defeat a level for it to have any effect. So if you only can deal four points of damage, don't even bother. And levels need to be done in order, so while you may have the needed spell card to beat the second level, but it's useless if you can't deal 5 points of damage to clear the first level before that. Enemies typically have many stages, so it can take a bit to deal with them.

You don't have to play to the enemy in front of you... but any enemies in front of you at the end of your turn will attack you for some damage and/or have some special effect in play. Sometimes you'll have to ignore the baddie in front of you to take out the guy who's about to kill Bob.

Killing enemies gets the group extra money, which can be spent to buy new cards, which go straight into your hand for the next turn. Cards can be as simple as getting more of a particular damage type into your hand, but the more expensive cards can do some pretty cool stuff. There's also an "assist" element that lets you play some cards on other people's turn to help them out.

The one really painful part of the game is that it's hard to get cards. You only draw cards if you have 3 or fewer at the end of your turn, and you only draw two. And there are quite a few baddies that require you to spend five points of damage to beat a level, which is your whole hand unless you've bought some more powerful cards.

After everyone has played for the current round, you draw a crossfire card, which has some nasty effect. The crossfire events are tied to how many crossfire cards have already been drawn, so the longer the game goes on, the nastier the crossfire events become.

The game comes with different scenarios. When you beat a scenario you get "karma" points which stay with your character and can be redeemed for stickers which add permanent abilities to your character. Some of the harder scenarios recommend you don't even attempt them until you've bought 75 points worth of karma upgrades.

I played this game with other gamers and it was pretty fun. But I knew as soon as I started playing this that my son would absolutely love this game. He's a huge fan of cooperative games and D&D-type themes. So this is going to be an instant buy for me.

Shadowrun has some real potential but random card flips can wreak the best laid plans.  This makes playing more and well a better proposition for success than trying to develop a winning strategy.  In other words, randomness encourages repeat plays to succeed even with a solid strategy, thus developing the power level of characters within the structure of a playgroup is more important than winning.  This is a game better played consistently by a regular group RPG style than as a stand alone board game.

After over a dozen plays, it doesn't seem all that playable out of the box. The core set includes too few scenarios, and no introductory missions. If you are purchasing this for solo play, I would wager you will be quite disappointed. Game play isn't broken, but it also isn't strategic or fun. Crossfire events are incredibly swingy, and on my first playthrough, I had an event prohibit attacking obstacles facing your runner, then a second event prohibit attacking other runners- effectively ending the mission. The events make planning and hand management futile. The parts of such a game that might actually be fun, combat and purchasing new cards for your deck are actually pretty flat. The game is better with the High Caliber Ops expansion, because it offers more scenarios and two more roles, but the added black market gear wasn't impressive.

There is a randomness, but there is a skill also - it's a great combination for cooperative game, because of the randomness skill never sleeps :)

+ Possibility of cool combos.
+ Good art, theme and thematic sense of each card.
+ Good upgrading system.
+ Good challenge (also random).
+ 2 out of 3 scenarios feels pretty different - in the first the goal is to kill every bad guy, In other - just survive for some time (not played the 3rd yet).

- Small amount of cards for this price.
- No real feeling of "There's a lot is going on!".
- Ideally play only with 4 players (mechanically) but becames too long for what it is.
- Pretty easy to forget about theme.
- Very random (enemies and market).

What an awful game. There's a big difference between being challenging and just being arbitrarily near impossible. This game is the latter. If you don't draw the right cards, then you lose. In any game, I call that a design flaw. 

The theme is cool, but quickly fades away as people merely focus on the colors needed to defeat an obstacle. 

"Can someone help me with 2 green and a blue?"
"Sure, but I need 3 black over here."

The dollar value of this game is also suspect. Legendary is about the same price and you get almost triple the number of cards. 

Oh, if you love the bore-me-to-death grinding in Korean MMOs, then you might like the karma system in this game for improving your character.

Good, fun, quick, co-op, deck-building game, but expect extreme randomness - fx. first game we almost won only losing by a one in three card draw on the the final round; second game we were wiped out by a random event on the second round.

I wish there was a bigger variety of cards and more missions. It would also be nice if I could carry some of my stuff (like weapons) throughout the consecutive plays. Otherwise it is perfect.

Shadowrun: Crossfire is part of the second wave of persistent world board gaming, following the groundbreaking Risk Legacy and Pathfinder Adventure Card Games. The big innovation is having characters that grow in strength and equipment as you repeatedly play them from session to session. It's a great idea that invests players in every game, even the ones they are losing.

Crossfire itself is more or less a typical deck-builder; you draw a hand, try to kill a bad guy, make some money to buy a new card for your deck, shuffle and repeat. This goes on for a few turns until you die...and you will die, a lot. The game is brutally, punishingly hard. It seems the typical path is to lose over and over, until you can buy a mercy upgrade to your starting stats. Then do it again, until you can buy another one and on and on until you eventually are starting on more or less equal footing with the mission.

That's fine, but between the character growth being so slow and the inclusion of only three missions, it seems like a mighty boring grind. Granted, the missions are just a basic structure for the card play, so each individual game will feel very different depending on which enemies are drawn. Still, even though I can justify the missions being repetitive, something about the card play strikes me as incredibly dull. Damage types only matter about a quarter of the time and almost all the cards in your starting deck are just textless damage cards. This makes the first half of the game super boring and borderline soulless.

Like I said, it's not bad per se, just not quite as exciting as I would have hoped. The good news is that if they can expand it fairly regularly, things can only improve as far as mission variety and deck building goes. As it sits now, I feel it's a strictly average game, but depending on what those expansions contain it could either improve greatly or just crash and burn. We'll just have to wait and see.

Shadowrun: Crossfire is a hard game. I mean, it's the kind of game that will knife you in the gut, steal your wallet, dump you in the gutter and kick you in the head on it's way out. Even when you win a game of Crossfire, don't expect a parade or some sort of vacation package. You'll be lucky if you walk away with enough to pay the bills. And although playing Crossfire may surely qualify as some form of masochism, there are the underlying elements that make it so fascinating to me.

This is a deck-building game at it's core but it does things differently that most deck-builders. For one, it's a co-op game. Either your team pulls off the mission successfully, or you go down in flames together. Leave no man behind. This means you're teaming up to overcome a series of traps and enemies that the game throws at you, and if any one player is compromised, your whole team loses.

Each player has a role in the group and their beginning deck is geared toward that role. Each of the four basic roles is associated with a specific color of card and although any player can acquire and use any card, most of the cards are more powerful when combo-ed with other cards of their color. This means that each player tends to specialize in their own job. The Mage gets lots of heavy damage spells and the ability to cycle quickly through his deck. The Decker (hacker) can retrieve cards from his discard pile or cancel enemy abilities. Each role is important in keeping the team effective.

Unlike most deck-builders, players may end up acquiring "assist" cards, which lets them use abilities on another player's turn. These are hugely impactful and every role should try to pick up at least a few of these to help deal with the game's punishing obstacles.

Also unlike most deck-builders, your hand doesn't completely empty each turn. Instead, you need to decide whether it's better to spend a card now or save it for later. You'll usually want to play a few cards, since you only draw more if your hand is below a certainly limit, but any cards you don't use will stay in your hand (and trust me, you'll need them). Also, cards you purchase go straight to your hand, which adds yet another level to the strategic decision-making.

Truthfully, some of the game's overbearing difficulty can often come from the "Crossfire Event" deck, a deck that you have to draw from at the beginning of each round that will often make you roll your eyes in disgust. Some terrible, morale-crushing things can happen as a result of these cards, although you can occasionally get lucky and draw one that does little-to-nothing to hinder you. This is my one minor complaint. The fact that some of these cards can basically turn an advantageous position for the players into a veritable brick wall with one unfortunate flip.

But if you can manage to conquer a few missions, you'll be rewarded with sweet, sweet Karma that you can turn it into cool, permanent upgrades and new abilities. Like starting with extra cash, better cards in your starting deck or being able to revive fallen allies. This is what keeps you chugging forward, waiting to unlock that next tier of sweet powers. It will take you a lot of patience and more than a few scars to get there, but once you do, you've got something tangible to show for it, and that's such an exciting thing.

RATING: N/A
Co-op deck builder in the sci-fi cyberpunk world of Shadowrun.  Mix and match your custom characters, put event cards into play to make the crossfire even more challenging. Random draw obstacles and try to stay alive long enough while working together as a team to defeat them. Use your credits to buy spells and gear for your deck. Earn legacy style achievement stickers as your Shadowrun characters grow more badass. Only 4 players is kind of a bummer.

Definitely a bit easier when you read the rules correctly!  Plays quick if you have to keep aborting, only played with 2 players so far.  A few upgrades ought to help with things! 
It's similar to a coop deck idea I had, and it's Shadowrun, which hits that soft spot for me.  Art is great, design has some neat twists and only a one or two hangups (failing a lot :D )

Have been playing this solo (2 runners) quite often and I'm really loving it! Have only had one successful mission but that's okay because it's still fantastic. 

I do wish there were a few more market cards because you really do start to see them all after a few games. But it's still definitely one of my favorites solitaires so far.

Have the expansion pre-ordered.

Highly enjoyable coop deckbuilding game. Pretty challenging, you don't always win, but you can get a small bonus for failing a mission as well as winning it. Persistent characters are the superb addition. I can easily see more expansions with more missions and characters.

I want to give this game a much higher rating. I want to give it an 8. It has great theme, plays quickly and has a campaign mode which I adore.

The thing I like about co-operative games is that they tend to be puzzles that the group has to figure out the best way to solve. When you fail, it is likely because you were solving it wrong.

In shadowrun, you lose because the obstacle decks decided it was time for you to die and you seem to have no say in the matter.

An enjoyable, fast-paced deck builder with a high challenge level. There's enough to sustain quite a bit of play straight out of the box however the game does feel rather light in the mission department and it could do with fleshing out a bit more in general. I can see this game getting a lot better if the expansions are designed well...If there are any expansions.

A mini-monster wargame. Essentially 3 games in 1 box (Standard, Advance and air-war only). First edition unfortunately suffered from lots of errata (rules, chits, player-aids and map).

I usually play war game simulations to learn history. This time I wanted to learn what was going on over in Korea. This excellent game, although a bit complex for me, a beginner, still showed me the balance of power between the two sides, so was quite informative. I was surprised to see the DRPK juggernaut and its potential impact on South Korea. I look forward to other games in the NextWar series.

A great development and improvement of the older Flashpoint Korea. 

clear, and easy to learn rules mean that players will be up and playing in relatively short time.

A very solid game on modern war on the Korean peninsula. The game does overstate the North Korean strengths but it is still a very tough battle for them to get south. I have only played the game with the advanced rules as I enjoy the various air units and missions. Hopefully other games in the series will be published.

Great game so far, a bit fiddly and the formations are tough to keep track of due to color matching issues. The air war is important but seems to dominate the play time.

RATING: 3
I jumped right to the advanced game Tactical Surprise scenario, which was probably a mistake ... it's pretty heavy-duty, lots of units (lots of battalions and brigades), lots of micromanaged attacks, and the full air rules seem, to me, to be needlessly detailed (we pretty much know how this is going to work out, all the allocation decisions of individual squadrons don't really make much difference to the overall outcome. The cleaner air points system of the standard game seems more reasonable).

Anyway, I'm an OCS guy, but the full game was just too much for me. Not sure how much to blame the not-great rules and fuzzy scenario set-up, but it couldn't be helping. If you want to try this game, my recommendation is to absolutely start with the standard game and work up to the advanced game. The full-on thing is huge and pretty daunting.
---
I somehow got sucked into this game after reading the rules and because of my fondness for MMP's Korea: The Forgotten War.

I'm trying just to set up the Tactical Surprise advanced scenario, and have been taken aback by how confusing and underspecified it was. It was probably an hour of hunting down information in an unindexed rulebook before coming to something satisfactory, although some questions remain unanswered even after all that.

RATING: 8
Have played two scenarios using basic rules. Set-up is obtuse, but the system is smooth and easygoing, map and counters are attractive and the situation intriguing.

A third play, again using standard rules. Lovely, flowing game with both local tactical problems, and more operational duelling over the initiative.

RATING: 7
I liked Taiwan quite a bit, and system whilst processes intensive is rather satisfying. The game has a more closed starting position as both sides are line up at the DMZ. I find the efficiency ratings on some of the Best Korea units to be a bit suspect but this is entertainment more than insight.

The designers set out to create the definitive treatment of modern warfare, and in the fortunate absence of a real conflict of this nature, there is no way to be completely sure they succeeded.  All can probably agree that modern war will be complex and many faceted, but unfortunately, the designers allowed this reality to grossly over-encumber the game with sub-systems, mini-games and chrome.

I note at the outset that, probably in recognition of the concerns above, the designers included a fairly simple Standard Game that allows one to have a fairly rudimentary, but much more fun, treatment of the campaign.

The Advanced Game is intended to be the prime product, and tends to be a real slog.  The air war is really a highly complex mini-game unto itself, and I would recommend the alternate air war rules as (1) more realistic, (2) easier to play and (3) reducing play-time.  The detection and strike sub-systems (missiles, special forces, "HQs") is highly chromed and with carpel-tunnel inducing die rolling.  The naval subsystem is way more than necessary for this particular game, including complex submarine and mine warfare (but probably needed for other naval oriented games like NWT).  There is a cyber-war alternate rules that is really kind of a hex and counter mini-game that doesn't make much sense and probably could best be handled with a random events table.  In short, this is not an entry-level game, and is  challenging to me with about 35 years of gaming experience and no fear of complex games.  My rule book is literally falling apart from constant thumbing looking for rules.  I believe it would take numerous plays to fully master the nuances and applications of the system.

With all of that said, I do applaud the designers for the initiative system which gives the initiative player a special sequence of play advantage and the opportunity to maintain the advantage by reaching certain VP benchmarks.  The rules concerning light infantry, airmobile and paradrops creating a fluid front line (or none at all) are good.  Those systems are fully playable in the standard game.

ETA:  I would recommend the post publication Regime Change Scenario, plus Reality Check Rules (maybe with only -1 ER for the DPRK), which can be obtained here or from GMT.  This is a much more interesting situation and lets the ROK / US flex their operational muscle against a relatively conventional foe rather that be flattened by the DPRK steamroller.  Of course, now there probably need to be some tac nuke rules, but that might take the fun out of it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game overall.  My biggest beef is that play is unbalanced, especially at first with the majority of the play focused on the DPRK.  In later turns and in later scenarios, the ROK gets more play time but still the vast majority of the time the ROK is just watching the DPRK player.  There is a lot of chrome (too much?) that needs to be learned and the rules could be organized better, but it's a good game to simulate a modern war on the Korean peninsula. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Really a monster with respect to play-time.  While the amount of counters and rule complexity is not too high, it takes a long time to play; on an 'initiative' turn, each side moves 3 times in addition to air strikes, special forces, and such.

The amount of errata with counters, charts, and rulebooks is pretty disappointing.  Even with all of the corrections, ambiguity still exists when all of the various systems interact.

I'm guessing that the campaign is 40-80 hours of playtime, and both players will need to make a serious committment to reading and understanding the rules, including some solitaire playing to avoid early fatal mistakes.

Once you learn all the rules and invest enough time to understand how to play well, how balanced are all of the different variants and options?

RATING: 10
My favorite: Next War - Operational - medium / difficult

Plus:
-Finally a fresh and original theme in wargameland!
-Fantastic components; maps, counters and player aids are the best I have seen lately.
-Basic rules are very accessible, intuitive and comprehensive: jump in and play for wargamers and could almost be used an introductory wargame.
-Finally a wargames that incorporates air units. 
-Large hexes are really convenient.
-Simple-as well as advanced rules set with three options: strategic buildup, tactical surprise, strategic surprise (like in NATO:next war in Europe).
-Air war reminds me of The Third World War, gives a nice dimension to the game.
-SCUD attacks, commando raids and infiltration by light units; a wargamers delight.
-I like the ZOC rules; only units above 2 strength points exert ZOC (like in Anzio) 
-Very nicely integrating actual situation with Kim Jong Un at the head of DPRK. Man I love to play the DPRK!!
-This seems to become a Next War series with fantastic potential for recent and future conflicts and I hope to see Taiwan, Iran and the Middle-East in the near future. 

Minus:
-Sadly they did not depict all of the peninsula like The Korean War (well you get oversized hexes instead). I would have loved to strike targets on the Chinese border and the inland rocket base.
-Rules could be clearer and an index would be a great help. In fact this should be standardvin any rules set.
-At the back of the CRT is another display; either the display or CRT needs to be copied as you can't use them both...
-Advanced game is mega cool but extremely procedure heavy. I can't think of any other game in my collection with 2 full pages of procedures.
-The replay value should be warranted by offering various levels of surprise as well as two levels of play (basic and advanced). For those who only play the basic game, the replay value is somewhat limited.

Anyhow, extremely happy, highly recommended and don't let the price keep you away; you get a lot for your bucks. can't wait for new titles in this series: apparently Taiwan, Iran and Middle-East are lined up an I hope they consider a Cold War war theme in the near future.

Rules for this game seemed too cumbersome. Counting of odds in combat was too lengthy and convoluted for what it was. Air game did not entertain us for what it was.

I quite liked advanced rules which added some chrome and more options to game. But then problem is that there is no smaller scenario for advanced rules which makes it unplayable monster for us.

RATING: 9
On first sight it looks like a traditional hex-and-counter wargames, however it introduces a lot of new ideas and concepts which makes the NW series a fresh and enjoyable system. I particularly enjoy the advanced game aspects of the game, such as supply, special forces, theater weapons, air-and-naval interactions, etc. There is a lot of meat to this!

The designer, and other veteran players, have been very prompt and helpful in answering any rules questions I've had!

I have played only with the standard rules, and the game managed to captivate me completely.

The fighting is bloody, as the CRT often assings hits to the attacker regardless of odds ratio. It's more important to gather favourable DRM's by using airpower, attacks from different hexes, light infantry, helicopter support etc.

It's an interesting system, and a welcome change from the typical WW2-genre. Highly recommended, and I can't wait for the next volume in the series.

While the standard game is easy to get into the advanced game will take some dedicated time to learning the system.  Everything that you would want to know about a future conflict in Korea is presented here, with rules covering tunnels, air superiority operations, and much, much more.  I do take issue with some of the better than average ratings for the NK units, but then it might be a play balance issue.  Overall, a very impressive game.

Lots of interesting mechanics. Rule book makes lots of assumptions about baseline knowledge of player and that generates lots of confusion/questions. Fortunately these were quickly answered on BGG.
Have tried advanced rules yet.
Each turn very long due to multiple opportunities for movement and combat.
So far the fun has been diminished by the rules overhead. Hopefully with time, fun factor will go up.

Excellent game scales well from easy-to-learn basic game 'standard rules'.  For more depth add optional rules for the advanced game with its detail and those cool little aircraft.  The air game in Mitch's Next War series(Korea, Taiwan, India-Pakistan, Poland) is a great advance from earlier attempts in other games.

This is a great series that adapts to your gaming experience level and your desired level of realism and works well to ease new players into the basic game 'standard rules'.

A bit more fiddly than I was expecting...  So far have played the standard games.

Pluses - 
larger hexes are nice.  
Graphics are very good.
Topical subject
lots of "puzzles" to solve in order to attack - but rough on the ROK forces (especially with the deadly combat)


Minuses 
- upgunning the NOKs (understand that this was needed) 
- the fact that combat table is on the back of a status tracking sheet necessitating photocopying (not a big deal, but annoying)
- fiddlyness - it was not as simple/smooth as I was expecting hoping - especially give its heritage (Third World War Series)

I have mixed feelings about this game.  Despite an imposing number of phases, the standard game is surprisingly straightforward.  The DPRK seems to have a distinct advantage at least in the standard scenario.  If I was rating just the standard game, I would rate this a 7.

Then there are the advanced rules.  I gave up after reading the air combat rules, which are very complex.  The air rules seemed complex for complexity sake and seemed to involve you working through a lot of processes.  The reason I gave up is that it did not seem like all those extra rules were going to increase the depth of strategy/tactics proportionately.  Rather than spending your time making grand plans, you seemed like you were going to be spending most of your time slogging through all the phases and tables.

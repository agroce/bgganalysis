RATING: 6
A one-two-three reveal game that is not as good as Hoity Toity, Edel Stein and Reich, or Libertalia, but is moderately fun I guess.   We played it with four players and I was underwhelmed; perhaps it is better with six players.

It's OK but nothing particularly special.  It's basically a game where you hope that everyone else doesn't pick the same option as you do, and that gets stale pretty quickly.

Family game with some luck but with enough strategy to keep everybody (young and old) interested

Good first play. Quick and lots of double-think and triple think. Anyone can get into it. Will be interesting to see how it holds up to more plays.

Spiele von Stefan Risthaus haben mich bis heute nicht sonderlich gereizt. Ein Grund für meine skeptischen Vorbehalte findet sich dann auch in SANTO DOMINGO wieder: die excell-Tabelle bzw deren Verwaltung oder meinetwegen auch Verhübschung. Das Hin- und Herschieben von Tauschmarkern macht für mich noch kein Spiel. Aber genau das ist SANTO DOMINGO. Da hilft auch nicht die vermeintliche Zockerei, die mich damit spekulieren lässt, wer jetzt welche der Handkarten spielt, die jeder Spieler identisch auf der Hand hat, um entweder Waren in SP zu tauschen oder gleich SP zu kassieren. SANTO DOMINGO verzichtet auf jegliches verspieltes Element und bleibt eine blutleere Zahlenreihe. SANTO DOMINGO ist es nicht gelungen, mein Interesse gegenüber anderen Werken des Autors zu wecken.

compared to Port Royal, a quite boring, luck based game that is only interesting in the last 5-10 Minutes.

I guess it's good for a small and short game, but for sure not my kind of game.

Pretty much just a bluffing game, with a solid game around it. Could be loved by those who like games like "Love Letter" and "Port Royale".

The game feels like Libertalia, but without the flavour – which is its strength but also its weakness. It is boiled down to its core mechanisms, role selection and bluffing, which makes Santo Domingo easy to grasp, and quick to play (less than 30 minutes) even for bigger groups (up to 6). The downside of being lean is that it is rather theme-less and plays mechanically rather sooner than later. And it has a small memory element, which some people — adults, basically ;) — may dislike.

Time-less functional concept, good game, but not very exciting.

Yes, this worked well. At first, I was a bit put off by the icons, but with only eight different cards, it's certainly manageable. Would play again, though it's not really my kind of game.

Same theme as Port Royal, but with a brand new game mechanics ;)

RATING: 7.5
A fun guessing game, with a light tactical element. Cards played bring VPs and goods but where the yield depends on what is in a communal resource pot and which cards the other players selected. Plenty of luck involved but has a lovely tempo, with an engaging simultaneous card 'reveal' each turn and it's a nice bonus if tactical card selection pays-off. A pleasant, quick, well illustrated filler.

I was a bit turned off by the art on the box and cards, but I enjoy this game a lot after trying it out. 

The icons are very simple (just 2 different icons) and the conditions for each card become clear very quickly. Each card lists its own rules and you don't need the rulebook to check on them again after the first explanation. 

It works similarly to Libertalia. You have to estimate what the other players are going for, and select your own card accordingly. There is also a memory mechanism, where you try to remember what the others have already played. 

Plays fast and is entertaining. 8 stars

Après Port Royal, un autre jeu très malin dans une petite boîte. Mécanique très simple et très agréable. J'aime beaucoup.

Blind bidding, simultaneous card/action selection. Get resources, get points, be the first to 45 points. A short filler, good to kill some time.

A fun, quick, simultaneous card-action selection game of points, goods, and the trading between the two.  Really nice that it plays up to 6, and in no longer timeframe than at the lower player counts.  Great for a quick start or end of game night.

A very simple simultaneous-selection double-think game - kind of a microgame version of Havana or Libertalia. Not bad, despite the thoroughly underwhelming setting and art.

--Feb2018-- Yeah; much like it's [thing=180355][/thing] ancestor.  It's quite harmless with 2 (though son #2 claimed he liked it, which is something); I'm interested to discover what I think of it at higher player counts.

Tiny simultaneous action-selection game. Players each have the same identical eight cards and choose the order of play (the last allows recovery of previously played cards). Cards are always resolved in order from 1-8, with lower numbers generally providing fewer resources but taken earlier, possibly leaving nothing for later players -- e.g., the 1 card takes up to 2 VP from the scant few available earch round, while the 2 card takes up to 5 VP if there are any left. Other cards give bonuses for correctly guessing what other players will do (e.g. collecting goods if others played the 1 or 2 cards).

My experience with these simultaneous action games is that they get more painful and less interesting with more complexity and more players; Santo Domingo (nee Visby) is about right. At higher player counts it's a solid prediction/outguessing filler, but the most surprising thing about it is that it was initially released as a two player game, which amps up the psychology.

The new edition is part of a series with Port Royale and includes the same dull theme and mediocre Klemens Franz art. It's clever enough to play anyway.

A near-perfect timing-puzzle filler. Gets a mite too chaotic with 5-6p, but lightning fast at any player count with just the right decision horizon.

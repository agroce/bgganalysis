Downgraded from 8.4 to 8.1.  While I love the themey self-perpetuating building mechanic, I think some of the cards could be more effective and the little skittering wine tokens are reason enough I'll probably never play it again. Played again- upgrading to 8.4 again. I love to hate this one.

A very thematic, scalable, easy to learn, worker placement strategy game about developing your personal winery.

Yes yet another worker placement, and yes even another wine making game, but this game is good, very good.  The artwork is pleasing, the components are high quality and unique, the theme is strong, to play is easy to play well is challenging, it plays 2-6 players, and it has a plethora of expansions.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to 20 points (or to score even higher in the round when someone scores 20).  Each round you choose turn order, with each position being provided a benefit for the round, the better the benefit the later you go as going first is very important.  On your turn you place a worker and execute the action, with each action having more than one space but limited space and with each having a bonus for the first person to take it.  The big twist is that each game round occurs in two major seasons, summer and winter, and if you use all of your workers during summer, you will have none left during winter as you don't get workers back until the end of the year, also there are different and valuable actions in both seasons.  There is a pause in between seasons (fall) where you acquire a bonus card.

There are a couple of odd/disconcerting aspects to the game.  There are bonus cards available in both summer and winter but there are not at all balanced.  Also money is very tight during most of the game but then you are often cash flush late in the game and there is no longer any real use for it.  Going first is absolutely critical late in the game and you can get completely locked out through no fault if your own due to the rotating turn order selection.  Apparently some of the expansions and new updated rules address some of these issues and the designer seems very in-tune with the gaming community and he is always looking for feedback and making improvements.

This is an example of what all kick starters could and should be (too bad I missed the original kick starter but at least I got on board for the expansion); a top quality game with tons of extras and a designer always communicating and looking to make a better product.  Overall it's a very solid light to mid weight strongly themed euro strategy game that I would recommend by a first time designer.

Own the [boardgame=147101]Tuscany[/boardgame] expansion, which is an absolute must-have, making a very good game a great one, as well as the [boardgame=193823]Moor Expansion[/boardgame], and the [boardgame=214463]Special Worker Promo cards[/boardgame].

Looks beautiful - if very muted and serious - and gameplay is very familiar from endless other available worker placement titles. This is a good one, but it runs long. The cards add a massive dose of randomness and are probably unbalanced. This jars in such a heavy, serious game.

LIKE: A bit of engine building. The theme fit well. Easy to learn. Planning is rewarded.
DISLIKE: Cards can be swingy, leading to some advantages that other players don't have. So this leads to being slightly luck dependent. There are a few attack cards, but generally give players a choice.

OVERALL: A delightful game that plays smooth and within a good time frame (except 6 players can be long). The cards seem to be powerful when timed properly, but this is what makes the game interesting. Similar to Lords of Waterdeep.

RATING: 6
Viticulture offer nothing exceptional or fresh. It is just a basic worker placement for its core mechanics. The fun factor might be a bit below average. This is due to the repetitive nature of your actions, i.e., harvest-make wine-deliver-harvest-make wine-deliver-harvest-make wine-deliver and so on. 

I also did not like how half of the action spaces were useless for the first half of the game and then in the second half you used nothing but them. Personally, I would have liked to see a more balanced use of actions through the whole game. Furthermore, the fact that your first delivery might be the most valuable one and the last the least valuable definitely does not add to the dramatic arc. One reason behind all this is that there is basically only one basic route for victory.

There is nothing broken nor exceptionally bad design choices. Viticulture just feels too much of work, one dimensional, and is at least 60minutes too long to be anything but average.

RATING: 6.5
*Rating based on one play with some parts of the expansion.

Standard Euro worker placement game that doesn't do anything particularly new.  The division of the round into seasons is one of the unique aspects of the game, but I didn't particularly care for it.  For one, it could lead to extra down time if you pass early in a season.  Additionally, if multiple players save too many workers for the last season, a lot of workers can go unused (or used for a highly inefficient action).  This was particularly an issue for the last turn of the game because most of the point-scoring spaces are in the last season.

The theme also didn't do anything for me, but that's mostly personal taste.

I strongly recommend the expansion if you do try the game.  I haven't played the base game alone, but it looks like it would be very dull on its own, and the player who brought the game said he wouldn't play just the base game again now that he had the expansion.  My rating here is based on using at least some parts of the expansion (particularly the new board).

RATING: 5
We played with four players, and two placement positions. I suspect five players and three positions or 3&2 would make a different and much better game. The limited placement meant that little happened, and that slowly, making this an extreme case of a design that prevents players from playing. Viticulture is three- and five-player only, I think, and the makers should have warned us.

It's a medium-light Euro with a surprising amount of depth. While it may seem like there's one path to victory (fulfilling orders), that's not actually the case. There are various avenues to score victory points and it is best to diversify so you aren't hindered by lack of worker placement spots. Very good game and I want to play more.

Looks like an interestingly themed and tight resource collection / turn it into some other resource type game but then the wild swing of the cards come into play and the marriage of the two doesn't quite gel for me.

Beautifully-presented, elegantly-designed game.  I liked seeing the lifecycle presented here: drawing vine cards -> planting them -> harvesting grapes -> crushing them into wine -> selling bottles...it felt very authentic.  I'm just a little bothered by the cards.  At least half of them are worthless, depending on where you are in the game...which makes the drawing and playing of cards very tedious.  Still pretty decent, though.  Don't know yet if it will fire [b]Grand Cru[/b].

An excellent worker placement game.  My issue with the game is that card draws can have a [b]strong[/b] effect on your success.  More good draws than bad and you will have a very good chance at winning.  More bad draws than good and you will have a lot to overcome.  It's certainly not guaranteed, but since there is a broad range of card strengths (and some of them are situational) this can have a significant impact.  It kind of hits doubly so since there are a variety of visitor cards and order cards.  I'd be happier with the game if this disparity were less determinative.

EDIT (7/18/16):  The above rating and description are for the base game.  As in base base.  As in the base game that no longer exists because Stonemaier wrapped three small expansions into it and now sells it as the Essential Edition.  ...but get Tuscany and use those modules, okay?

August - :d10-6: :coal: For a kickstarter, this game was pretty good. The theme was interesting, the bits were excellent, and I liked the engine building aspects of the game.

Like almost every kickstarter, it ended up feeling unpolished. There were parts with needless complexity (all the different buildings that no one built until the end), randomness in the form of the cards (there was such a huge difference between how good individual cards were) and pacing issues (by the end of the game, half the boards was useless).

If I were to play it again it would have to be with an odd number of players, due to how strangely tight the game is. I had fun with my one play because the theme and bits were very good.

Yet another engine-building, worker-placement game...but it sure feels different than the rest of the lot! More so than most engine-builders, the mechanics seem very much tied to the theme. If it was re-themed as a tea plantation, I'd probably always want to be playing it!

This is the second game I've played by Messrs. Stegmaier and Stone, the first being their superior game Euphoria. Nevertheless, after playing Viticulture, I want to paraphrase what Jon Landau said about Bruce Springsteen: "I have seen the future of boardgaming, and its names are Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone."

RATING: 7
A lot of games are about creaming your opponents in business, on a map, or whatever.

Viticulture is more like a race to get your business up and running. And then, once it has a steady customer or two, and a few regularly producing fields, the game ends.

You get a lot of the basic Euro-style mechanisms, but since you're not really competing with anyone, you get to go through the process of business-making more as a labor of love than as a competition. Yes, you want to get through the goalpost faster than the others, but by the time that happens, everyone's basically gotten their business functional as well, just not quite as profitable off the bat. So they still feel like the succeeded.

It's a very friendly and good feel game, while giving you some fun choices.

The cons of the game, however, are that:

1) No one can remember how to plant vines, create grapes, and turn them into wine. You just can't emphasize how much they need to pay attention when you go through it, you're going to have to go through it all again, individually, for each player, as they get to that step for the first time. Everything else in the game is very straightforward. You plonk a dude down and grab something. But the wine production pipeline - which is barely really a mechanism of the game, just a sequence of events that largely happens on its own according to some rules - is impossible for anyone to remember, until they've done it once.

2) The game advertises itself as being for 6 players. I've played 4 players once and...never again. Maybe if you had some expert players, none with AP, you could fit 6 in there. But I'd really suggest sticking with 2-3. And so it really seems like a waste of space to have that third bubble on every location.

3) If you get the Tuscany expansion, everything on the board is designed to give you stuff (particularly cards). It's sort of a chore to keep track of all the stuff you should be getting between each season, plus all the things you get from your actual actions. It ends up handing you so much stuff that if they added 'play a card' to the rooster track, you could basically play the whole game without ever placing any meeples, just deciding what time of the day to get up at. You would end up getting almost as much stuff that way as playing the original game, regular. And while that aspect probably appeals to the sort of person that likes Facebook games, which are just constantly trying to push items and coins and whatnot onto you, to appeal to our instinct to desire plenty; it's not like the base game is all that tight, so that it needed an easy mode. It was already a fun, easy, multiplayer solitaire building game. Having all four seasons is good, thematically. It definitely seemed like an obvious oversight in the original game. But I wish they'd left the rooster track alone and not put the star map on one side of the board.

At heart, Viticulture is a standard worker placement and engine building game with some decent wine industry theming.   You will want to recruit workers early and balance the grape growing and wine making processes with the need to earn cash and to develop your winery.   I found nothing particularly novel or engaging in any of this.  What poisons Viticulture's vines for me is the luck of the visitor and order cards.   Some will give your engine a real boost straight away and others will not.  Sure, you can draw more, but this is an efficiency game and taking the time to draw more just isn't efficient.  

Artwork and production quality are both very good.  The distinctive pieces for each building type are a particularly nice touch.

A nicely thematic, pleasant and attractive worker placement game that reminds me somewhat of playing Agricola...except without the stress of feeding!  I like the turn order selection mechanic with rewards (look, free stuff!), as well as the planting and harvesting of grapes.  It has an interesting race to the finish aspect, nice interesting components, and plays around with mixing different colored grapes which felt fun towards the end.  

On first play, I felt some concerns regarding the seasonal cards, as quite possibly it seemed, among seasoned players, the game might be won or lost depending upon using as many of these seasonal cards as possible.  This is sometimes said about the game Goa as well: gotta acquire and play those special action cards!  Hmmmm...how about playing within the basic design? 

February 2015  8 of 10.

On second play, I again found the cards to be seemingly a bit too decisive for my euro gaming tastes.  Draw lots of cards, get good cards that happen to advantageously correspond to the game state, play these cards, and you are greatly favored.  Draw lots of cards, get merely decent cards that happen to NOT correspond to the game state,  play these cards, and you are less favored.  Draw a normal amount of cards that are merely decent, play these cards, and you are very unlikely to win against the preceding two.  Moral of the story in this game design?  Draw and play lots of special cards and hope for a good, lucky draw.  Hmmmm, that doesn't seem ideal for a euro.

Occupies the space between Stone Age and Agricola. Fairly simple and easy to grasp, streamlined play, but with meaty decisions and multiple paths to victory. Much of the game revolves around drawing cards and it feels like a little too much luck (this comes from someone who thinks the amount of luck in Stone Age and Agricola is just right). The theme really comes through in the game, it doesn't feel like "points salad." 

Elements of Tuscany improve the game so much that it makes the base game feel like a rough draft. The upcoming Essential Edition seems to fix this, although I think leaving out the enhanced board was a mistake. The new board changes the game drastically, and I think few people would ever want to go back to the old board. Again, it feels like the new board is the "revised, final" version of the game.

A worker placement game with not enough places to go around.  This would be a tight game of tempo and being out-of-phase, but on top of this are added decks of cards that are both extremely powerful and not at all balanced.  Drawing the right cards at the right time seems much more important than careful planning.  This needed to spend much more time in development to get the details (approximately) correct, as the result is too light to be a heavy economic game and much too heavy to be a family game.

Solid worker placement game with a unique twist as gameplay is less about blocking your opponents and more about receiving the additional bonus for going to a spot first and choosing a bonus which affects your turn order.

Minor downside is that some cards and buildings are just more powerful than others.

A very "ok" game.

I like it, but I prefer worker placement games that "evolve", games like Agricola or Le Havre that add different actions as the game matures.

The good:
 - Beautifully crafted and awesome looking.
 - Many Paths to victory.
 - The designer is actively involved in the community and makes a real effort to improve the game even after release where possible (the Grande Worker, for example, makes the 2 player version tons more fun)
 - A lot of worker placement games make more workers always better, here that's not necessarily the case since there is scarcity in action, it's more of a balancing act and not always automatically better. The flip side of that is getting higher priority feels too important.
 - Awesome thematically (if that's something you care about)

Could be good or bad depending on what you like:
 - Game is strangely balanced (number of player wise) based  on the way action spaces are allocated (getting another action space at 3 and 5 players), meaning the game is tons better with certain numbers of players if you like looseness of actions (3 and 5 players) and tons better with different numbers of players if you like tight action and lots of action contention (4 and 6 players)
 - Because of how so many actions build on others (harvesting leads to crushing which leads to placing orders) blocking players out of moves can be particularly punishing because you can't just move on to the next step in the chain, this can push your plans back years and often the back up alternative actions aren't just weaker they're often feel just plain bad (making the game less fun).
 - Making the most kick ass vineyard isn't actually the best thing to do and probably won't get you a win.
 - Little to no use for Lira end game.

The bad:
 - Feels (to me) like it ends abruptly and suddenly, also a little early.
 - Randomness of the visitor cards (feel unbalanced and too luck based)
 - Too few cards (cycle through the decks too often in bigger games)

Worker placement in two phases, Spring summer set up and grow your vineyard, Autumn/Winter harvest and sell.  Viticulture was engaging.  The addition of the super meeple allowed access to all actions which was apparently missing in the earlier version.  As the game moved on, so did seemingly the importance of the Autumn/Winter actions.  Some luck in cards drawn.  But sufficient planning opportunities to be engaging.

Very good worker placement. Super theme. Intuitive mechanics.

Bit too long with 6p. I think it's best with 2 or 4.

Dóri:
First I thought that I won't like this game as I do not really like games where I have to manage the resources. But in this game the game mechanism, the rules, the little accessories are built up in a very-very logival and self-understood that you don't mind the many small rules. The cards, the board, the money and everything in the game is very well-designed and beautiful. For two-players it is relatively fast (~40 minutes), but with more players (above 4) it is very-very long. I really like that I can follow a lot of different strategies in the games not to mention that the expansion makes changes in the game where it was needed (e.g. in the beginning we have little money, that's why Mamas and Papas come and we can inherit some money/worker/etc. from them).

Eddig csak az esseni kiadással játszottam, de mivel ez az eredeti, ide írom az értékelést. Az esseniben néhány kieg is benne van, és kicsit javítottak a kártyákon, de az összkép szerintem nem sokban változhatott.

Röviden: a játék jó. Nekem az ugrott be elsőre, hogy kb. olyan Village szint, pontozásban is ugyanazt kapta tőlem. A körsorrend a Frescora hajaz nagyon, meg a kevergetés is, de annál ez nehezebb szint szerintem. Szép nagyon, irtó jól átjön a tematika. Túl sok eredeti nincs benne, de igényes, egész letisztult. A bajom csak az, hogy a sárga és kék kártyák túl erősek, gyakorlatilag lila kártyák nélkül is nyerhetőnek tűnik a játék, mert sima kis bónusz 1-2-3 pontokat aránytalanul könnyebben szerezhetünk, mint a borokkal a 4-5-6 pontokat. Simán összeszedegethető kicsikből a 20 pont. Ami kicsit nekem oda nem illő volt, az a néhány interakciós lap (pl. pontot veszek a riválisoktól, nem is tudnak benne megakadályozni), valamennyire ettől kiszámíthatatlan lesz... A kártyák úgy általában is visznek bele jó sok szerencsét, de lehet hogy nem akartak túl száraz játékot, és szerintem bőven tolerálható még ez a szerencse, és végül is a kártyák adják a savát-borsát az egésznek. Önmagában az akcióválasztásokkal lehet hogy uncsi lenne, és lennének túl egyértelmű stratégiák. Az akciók közül van néhány ami a játék bizonyos szakaszaiban teljesen használaton kívül kerül, de ez végül is tematikus. A 2 évszak akciói jól ki vannak találva, jópofa az egész úgy ahogy van. Máskor is jöhet!

A very well produced and streamlined worker placement game. For me it is the preferred out of the 3 with the same theme (vinhos,grand cru).I would also like to see a non-linear wine maturity. Other than that, game is great although I would recommend it with up to 4 players unless you don't mind the duration.

Viticulture is a medium-weight worker placement game about wine-making.
The mechanics are quite straightforward and non particularly original: place pawn, execute action. Rinse and repeat until somebody reaches the goal line.

So, what makes the game good (even if not great)?

First, there is a good amount of tension, provided by the scarcity of worker spots (and it scales very well with the variable number of spots). Therefore, turn order (managed by a wake-up time, à la Fresco) is very important, and the number of suboptimal moves is quite high. The Grande pieces, included in the second rules set, work well in letting players breathe a little.

Second, the theme for once is well represented and everything makes sense, more or less.

Then, why is Viticulture not great?

It is definitely a good game, in the same class of Stone Age or Waterdeep, but something is not as polished as it could be:
- the cards feel definitely unbalanced, and luck of the draw makes a great deal of difference;
- the wake up table seem quite pointless: going early is better, and the bonuses for going later in turn order rarely compensate this (with 6 players it is pretty crowded too);
- players seem to always compete for the same things at the same moment, different "trajectories" don't pertain to this game.

I would like to try it again, but it is hardly the most innovative game, and definitely not one of the best in its genre.

Initial Impression: The worker placement mechanisms in this game are supported by the muted, calming art of the board and cards. I love the glass beads and believe that more games could use them. This game is fairly easy to teach and can be used as a gateway game to the worker placement mechanism. The neutral theme aids in attracting non-gamers to the game. With multiple strategies to pursue there's enough depth for seasoned gamers as well. This is a game that I'm tempted to add to my collection.

Second edition, have to play a little more before I make a final decision on the game. At this point, seems like cards can determine the winner and there's no way to catch the leader due to grande worker.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent components and theme. I initially thought the game looked promising with lots of different options of what to build, harvest and do each turn. However as the cards you draw are so variable, it inevitably leads you down the path of having to get irrigation and the large cellar. Then it's everyone competing for most of the same spaces at around the same time. The cards that let you discard to draw more help, however an action space or two with this similar function would be even better.

RATING: 5
I wanted to rate after 2 plays, and the designer has asked for ratings, this score could go up if I get the chance to play with Kickstarter exclusive content and expansions - but those were not available in the retail copy I played...

The game is a very solid first published design, with outstanding production values.  The theme is well integrated and the game is fun, BUT there are balance problems.  The cards are very swingy and it really seems that the game could benefit from an early/late game deck split for the visitors.  Also, scaling is an issue - the 2 and 4 player games are terribly tight and very slow starting.  Turn order toward the end of the game is extremely important, too much so in my opinion.  There are just too many better worker placement games out there, despite the excellent theme and presentation.

An excellent designed worker placement with a theme that really works. 
With the exception of a couple of the expanded modules everything ties in  and works well together. A lot more elegance and refinement as opposed to games like Trickerion or CoM. 
I really look forward to planning my moves from season to season. The game captures my interest and keeps it; even in a game when I was losing and knew I didn't stand much chance in winning I was still looking forward to my turn. A game that is enjoyable to play win or lose!

It's a worker placement game that falls into a unique spot.  I think that Stone Age is a better game for 3-4, but Viticulture has the bonus of being playable to 5-6.

I think that Lords of Waterdeep is a better game, but Viticulture doesn't have the terrible downtime between turns (in my experience).  So, I'd go with Viticulure for the larger games.

RATING: 7
There is a lot of hidden I formation in this game, making scoring by your opponents unpredictable and thus difficult to interfere with. Your own scoring is somewhat random as it requires the draw of cards. Nonetheless there is certainly room for skill. I did not like the use of the large worker as it weakened blocking actions. I think the better more cutthroat game is without it, so I would want the original version.

Rating for the basegame alone. With the additional modules from [thing=147101][/thing] the game is a solid 9.

- - - - - - - - - -

Viticulture is a rock-solid game in the vain of Kennerspiel des Jahres. It offers great variety and multiple approaches as winning-paths.

Its biggest strength lies in the setting – making wine is a theme that has yet to see frowning faces (unlike Fantasy, Sci-Fi or agriculture). The action-spaces available all make perfectly sense even if they are abstracted a bit.
This really helps to introduce the game and hook players.

Among your workers you have a special "grande" worker who can go to action-spaces that are already occupied. This reduces the amount of blocking in the game, which gives newer players some leeway, but still offers interesting decisions when to use him as a game-round is broken into multiple phases.

With the addition of the superb expansion [thing=147101]Tuscany[/thing] the game gets additional 15 modules that you can mix and match to perfectly adjust the game's complexity to your needs.

I really like the theme. It was well implemented that I could feel the romance of running a winery. Gameplay-wise I would say its a light-medium weighted worker placement game due to the fact that the cards you draw play an important role. Some helper cards are really powerful and some are rather weak. So expect some luck involved in the game. However you still need some good planning to do well

Good medium Euro Game. A lot of micromanagement. Although there are two issues for me: First the lack of engine building makes the game rather tactical. You plan from turn to turn and cannot really form an involved game spanning strategy. Secondly many of the visitor cards are too strong. Therefore you play many of them whatever your original intent. Furthermore many visitor cards are as strong as fulfilling a contract, but contracts are much more work and therefore less efficient. (played with the Tuscany expansion)

Viticulture is a simple worker placement race game.  It is smooth and quick (at 3 player, 2 player is slower as are higher player counts) with fantastic components and the usual Stonemaier attention to detail.  It is also swingy and random enough to be unsatisfying at times.  To be fair, I'm not big on race games.  This is a good race game but I'd likely choose other race games (Steampunk Rally, for example) and would DEFINITELY choose Vinhos over this any day for a wine game.

Cool worker placement game. I like the split of the board and when you can do certain actions and play certain cards.  I'm not sold on the starting card distribution...it seemed to be a bit uneven.  If you don't get money, it sort of hoses you as some will have big money early.  But as the game goes on, you cycle through the cards pretty well.  It could go up.  I do have Tuscany and looking forward to adding more.

Scratches the same itch as Stone Age.  Good introductory worker placement game, and would be a winner with a group that likes to consume wine.

Not much to like in this game: card drawing is very luck-driven and can stop any chances to progress. Almost no player interaction and you only rarely can influence turn order, which results in inability to plan any moves ahead. Also, very few decisions to make - your strategy depends ONLY on available cards and your options are limited to what you got.

Juego de gestión de recursos y colocación de trabajadores, para producir vinos y servir pedidos. Es del estilo del vinhos, pero más "light". Está bastante bien. Los trabajadores los tienes disponibles para todo el año, pero se colocan por estación.. y cada estación tiene una serie de acciones distintas.
Tiene especial relevancia el uso de las cartas. Cada jugador tiene un tablero en el que planta las viñas, que cosechará en algun momento para conseguir uva y a patir de las uvas, obtener vinos que irán envejeciendo.. y el objetivo será venderlos atendiendo cartas de pedido para obtener puntos y recompensas.
Está muy entretenido. Es lento al principio, porque tienes que construirte el motor de producción, pero luego va rodao.
Recomendable.

This is a medium heavy that requires constant attention to all the moving parts, as you may have done a very fine job getting the wine finally ready for the big sale, but you didn't get those important cards earlier to bag the points for them. Or, this could happen at some earlier point, that you didn't get a building up, age the wines, for example, and you find you have to play catch up. However, the mechanics all work together neatly to make for an interesting and thematic game experience.

Really ties the theme, the seasons, the contracts, with a great little worker placement game. You start with money scarce, trying to build your "engine".

I've heard mixed things about this game... Some good. Some Bad. Some saying it was a pretty generic wroker placement.

For the last few weeks there have been three copies of this game floating around at my Tuesday evening group... We finally got around to playing it last night(6/4/2013) and I have to say I was plesantly suprised. This game has some interesting things going for it that will move it up on my list of most likely to play worker placement games. 

What I really liked: The seasons mechanic, the ageing of wine/grapes and the wooden components.

What I didn't like: The rest of the components...

RATING: 5.5
I just don't understand why this is so highly rated. It's a mediocre worker-placement game with the added mechanic of powerful cards that players randomly get from drawing blindly from two decks. Usually, the player who draws the most and best cards will arbitrarily win; it often does not seem lucrative to go for a "straight" strategy of making wines, ignoring the cards.

The end result is a game with too much luck for me. It ends up being either frustrating when you lose (because the scoring seemed beyond your control), or disappointing when you win (because you happened to get luckier than other players). 

I have already played with two of the Tuscany modules, but they have done nothing to change my opinion of the game.

My current comment is for Viticulture including the Tuscany expansion, as that’s the only way I’ve played it so far – but from what I can read and have been told, it’s a much better game with the expansion. I cannot imagine playing the non-expansion rules about that big worker! Although I think that some of the add-ons are a bit silly such as the map with area majority and stars; it seemed a little weird and more like an afterthought… 

The game itself isn’t novel and the worker placement mechanism isn’t carried out in a way I’m particularly fond of; I think the flow of the game is a little weird as lots of specific action spaces are extremely popular at the start of the game, but rather useless at the end… This is not something you see in great WP games like Agricola or Caylus I think, and that’s definitely a huge minus in my book. I do think the expansion helps with more varied and interesting action spaces, and I also like the small mini expansions such as, for instance, the mama and papas which makes you start with slightly different cards.

I didn’t like the fact that you have a lot of points in the end and cannot use them for anything unless you have been lucky and drawn the right card where you can pay money for a few VPs. And speaking of cards; I hate when a game clearly has under/overpowered cards… I mean come on, some of the cards do almost the same, but some are clearly better than others! Also, you can get really unlucky with the vine cards; I drew a lot of red whine, but all I produced were white wine – and this surely detracts from my gaming experience, because if I had gotten just an average amount of white wine cards I would have done much better… 

I have only played it once and with 5 players, and I would love to try it with 2-3. But with fewer players the tension of the turn order track (which can be crucial in the last round!) is probably going to vanish, at least somewhat. Now, you cannot really know when the last round is going to be, as the game ends once a player has reached 25 points. At the start of the game it seems like it’s going to take forever, but suddenly you get 5-8 points in a single turn and then the game is rapidly coming to an end! And I must give credit to the game that with very different strategies, all players were actually within 5 points of each other…!

So many things to do, and cards to use, and things to build, and oh, look, I ran out of workers and can't do anything else.  I am not very good at this game, but despite that, I still really like it.

Plus, it is a great, high quality game in terms of production quality, contents, and what-not.  Definitely must continued to be played.

Gameplay can go on a bit long with more than four players, and some of the cards are overly powerful, but overall, I love Viticulture.

RATING: 9
Only two plays in and I feel comfortable giving a rating. This is a very fun game and is a hit right away. The mechanics are easy to grasp--after one read of the rulebook we were off and running and only a couple of references back since then. It's a really tight worker placement, and the very limited resources is what makes it both fun and challenging.

The board is gorgeous- I just have to say that first. Like Agricola, there is tight competition for the worker placement that can be frustrating. Unlike Agricola, there are so many different paths to pursue for success that this does not have to be a problem (not to mention the grande worker option). Lush components, solid mechanics, and the freedom to pursue many different paths- this is an excellent eurogame. All of the constituents come together to bring out the theme for me.

One downside is the randomness of the card draws can be annoying and/or useless.

I kickstartered the expansion and am waiting for that to arrive, along with the errata rules and pieces for the base game, to get back into it.

Played with a friend and I really enjoyed this game.  I think it might be a bit too complicated for my younger kids so this one might remain one of those games I'd own if I had a regular group of adult players...but since my playgroup is made up of my 3 kids, all 11 or under, I probably will put the Viticulture money towards something I'll get more use out of with them.

Viticulture manages to achieve that Vinhos didn´t - creating thematic yet playable Wine making game. It is much more streamlined, so you don´t have to listen one hour long lecture of rules but you can start playing after short rules explanation or watching a video how to play. And I realy like that small random element - cards. Very thematic and well implemented! Expansion is also superb and almost must to have.

A brilliantly designed game.  Superb incorporation of theme and mechanics.  I can't wait to play again.

First game was a bit tainted by the clueless lady who sat next to me at ConnCon 2015.  She inadvertently cheated her way to the win.  Every move she made carried some degree of error.  I got tired of correcting her, the other 2 players didn't care and I got tired of hearing myself correct her turn, so I stopped.  She kept her extra workers with her structure tokens and would occasionally take from there when placing workers, which she always seemed to keep in hand.  Needless to say, she had her full workforce in no time and at no cost.  She calculated her harvests wrong and moved tokens incorrectly when making the wine.  She would take some card actions before actually playing the card, so nobody else could see what it said.  Every time, she either played the card wrong or wasn't on the correct space to play cards, so her turn would get undone.  The problem being that she already took indeterminate amounts of money, cards, points, wine tokens before putting cards down, so it was nigh impossible to backtrack.  Ridiculous!  Oh well, that's danger of playing with noobs at a convention.  However, I was still able to see through the fog to recognize this as a great game and will definitely acquire a copy.

This version is with Grande Workers.  This game is right for me. Pour a glass of cab. Sav. Or red blend and hit the vineyard. Maybe I'll tend to the fields, or crush some grapes. Maybe I will give a tour or see how the construction on the new irrigation tank is going. Or, Perhaps I will check in on our summer visitors and hear their ideas for improving my vineyard production, output and experience visitor experience. The mechanics are smooth and the theme is as dry as a large cellar red- and that's a compliment! The theme is so well done and integrated into a great system that welcomes a variety of approaches and play styles. Not a light game but a deep medium bodied blend of simple and deep! I would say I can't wait to start adding expansion modules in, but I beleive I want to savor each sip before I pour a fresh glass. This is a game to be savored, not chugged! Honestly, I scored it a little lower than I think it deserves simply because I know the Tuscany expansion will throw it higher and I needed room to grow. Grande workers add so much to the game. Nice call to listen to feedback and throw those in. Makes for some intersting and tough decisions and player int faction through tactical blocking.

Worker placement game about running your own vineyard. I enjoyed the theme and thought that the mechanics matched quite well. You need to plant fields, harvest grapes, turn them to wine, and then fill orders. Along the way there are ways to maximize your productivity such as recruiting more workers, building structures, and utilizing visitors (who have special skills). An all-around solid worker placement game that I would definitely play.

Rating is only after two plays, so is very much apt to change.  My one clear thought on the game thus far is that it is too long.  After the second game, Yann thought that the timeframe may be due to the seemingly inflated role of the cards.  One spends too much time mining for cards that are what you need.

Both games have been teaching games, so perhaps the game time will decrease once playing with people who have played it before.  Will be interesting to see how long the next play will be.

Though the rating is low, that's really only for base Viticulture, which really is kind of bleh.

Add Tuscany, though, and the game becomes much, much better, probably an 8 or 9.  Indeed, it killed Agricola for us.  Why?  So much more variety, much more to do, more visitors, and structures.  The new board in Tuscany is an absolute necessity.

Our "base" Tuscany has all of the extra visitors (plus the Moor visitors), the new board, Mamas and Papas, and the Structures.  We'll occasionally use the special workers, but never use Patronage, Mafia, Formaggio, or Arboriculture.

[15 Feb 2017] - 6.5 (3 plays)
This is a light wine making game (compared to Vinhos) where the money is secondary to the goal of establishing an engine to grow grapes, turn them into wine and then sell them for VP. The turn order bidding is unique and does present some challenges. Cards are almost always good and no reason to not want to use them. For now it's staying in the collection since my wife likes this game but I wish there was more depth to the game.

[9 Jan 2017] - 6 (3 plays)
Sold this game as I find the decisions and actions less interesting that Vinhos. The game tries to encompass the whole wine making process that leaving some of the actions, like the whole field planting, feeling like they're incomplete. The addition of the Mamas and the Papas is a must otherwise the game suffers from a static set of opening moves that are optimal. Just play Vinhos if you want to make wine, it takes about the same amount of time but gives you more to think about.

Viticulture is fun game to play, but many aspects of the game that are not intuitive.  In fact, the game is packed with so many non-intuitive elements that the first few games are more frustrating than fun.  This lack of polish adds considerably to the play time, and people lament inadvertent mistakes and ask continual questions about all of the rule exceptions.  There are also some balance issues with the player order system, and with some of the cards.  And finally, the glass beads included in the game do not fit on the board spaces where they are intended to go.

All of these problems turn an otherwise awesome game, into one that I will probably not play that often.

Pleasant worker placement game where players run a vineyard.  Workers are placed that do a variety of wine related actions, such as acquiring, growing, harvesting, crushing and blending grapes into wine.  Wine is converted into victory points.  It is standard middle of the road worker placement stuff that plays pleasantly, looks nice and offers a diverting hour or two.  It is not going to supplant the giants of the genre.  Some interesting design choices, particularly the edge of the world threshold of 25 victory points maximum - why?  I guess it gives useless late game money something to do (break the inevitable ties).  The cards seem very swingy too. Typical Kickstarter game that is a round of development short of being good.

The theme doesn't strike me, but it's integrated into the mechanics well. The cards add a bit to much random for my tastes.

Needs a lot of work, which is surprising for a game that was play tested as much as this one declared. Awful endgame, and only one path to victory makes for zero strategy. The only redeeming feature is the theme, for those of you who love wine.

One final note, it takes a BIG pair to put down other boardgames in the designer's discription of his game! In my opinion all the games he mentioned (Stone Age, Agricola, etc) are all much better games.

[b]Opinion after 2nd play[/b]
● I no longer felt enthusiastic about the game anymore. The game hugely affected by the luck of your order cards draw. If you screw up your initial plan for the order (or maybe got them mixed up), you're going to waste a lot of turns.

● Even the owner of the copy that I played is selling the game now. He said the game didn't have it's lasting power or something.

[b]Comment is written after one 4p game on 16th April 2013 (friend's copy):[/b]

● Components are excellent. The wooden tokens/meeples that are in the shape of a structure and people are a nice touch. Coins are large in size (feels good in hand) and of good cardstock quality. Player boards are slightly (very slightly) warp, but not a major problem.

● All player boards and main board come in two sides. Both sides show the exact same thing except that one side has names on each and every location for the purpose of learning the game. Once you get used to the game, you can simply use the side with no names. Totally redundant (not that the names make the artwork become busy or obstructing anything) BUT I think this is a nice touch from the designer to do this. So no complain there.

● Gameplay wise, in a 4 player game, it feels tight in a sense that 2 out 3 spaces of each action location can be used. You get the feel of wishing to do more but the respective action spaces are all filled up, hence you need to think of an alternative move or wish you get to go to the action space first/early in the next round.

● First player token rotates counter-clockwise rather than the normal clockwise fashion.

● There's "choose your wake up time" like what you see in Fresco. Waking up early allows you to choose the action space first, which is very important IMO. Waking up the earliest grants you no bonuses but waking up at the rest of the time grants you a bonus.

● There's a feeling of engine building in the game. 

● I like the part where cards in hand cannot be played freely. You need to go to the action space that matches the card that you intend to play, only then you get the permission to play down that card. Problem is, the available spaces for the action are limited and most of the time are filled up, unless you are the first or 2nd to wake up, or it so happen to be empty slot there (lucky you).

● The box says the game last for 60 mins as the winning or end game condition is met when a player reaches 20 points. It feels quick in general but I don't think that 60 mins is fairly accurate. You need to have the right card and uninterrupted flow of actions to be able to pull such a speedy victory. Our first play took longer though but that's completely normal as we were still learning the game.

● The game can accommodates up to 6 players, which I think is a huge plus. BUT, it's clearly going to be one hell of a tight game. 

● In our game, the tension builds up near 3/4 of the game as VPs for all players almost reach the 20 point mark. Since the game ends when a player reaches or exceeds the 20 points mark, all players were trying hard (blockings were involved) to pull a good play/combo to bag high points, thus being the one who ends the game. When the game ends, nothing is counted/converted to VPs, therefore what you get on the scoring track, will be your final point.

● All in all, I think it's a good game and I like it. Surprised that it turned out to be good.

RATING: 6
Worker placement games are probably my favourite genre of game. So I was excited about playing Viticulture. But it is only OK at best. The main downside is a dependence on very swingy cards. I won the game we played, but only because I drew the required card on my very last turn. Also it is a little fiddly with the conversions to wine from grape, not intuitive at all. On the positive side it looks lovely, and yields tense worker placement moments when there just aren't enough places given the demand. Definitely worth playing the revised Giant worker rules.

A wine themed worker placement with plenty of room for different play direction. Wine orders tend to direct players on the grapes they should cultivate, but the cards in the game can really provide some unique ways to create points in interesting ways. I own the Essential Edition, mixed with the Tuscany expansions that were excluded, with the extra visitor cards added to the whole mix. Tons of replay value in this set.

I will be copying/pasting this comment to the many versions of Viticulture and Tuscany. For reference, I only have experience with the Collector's Edition + Moor Visitor's expansion.

[b]Publishers: Rather than doing all of these iterative releases to improve your game: playtest, playtest, playtest. Get it right the first time! A game should have no 2nd edition (not talking about  additional printings and expansions) until the game is at least 5 years old. At least![/b]

Let's review how annoying it is to want to own everything Viticulture, in a congruent manner, from what I know of the line:

If you owned the first edition:
-Annoying randomness of the visitors
-VP cap
-No Grande worker if you get hosed.
-Other things I don't really know about because I never played it. Rahdo talks at length about it (I think in the Tuscany final thoughts because it improves many of the games issues)

Fine... upgrade to second edition edition?

If you owned second edition:
-You still have some the issues of the 1st edition but at least you have Grand Workers

In walks the Tuscany expansion
-Mamas and Papas: asymmetric startup. I don't like it, others do.
-New visitors: fixes some of the problems of the visitors.
-New Board: amazing in a gameplay sense but the glare on the glossy board is annoying and the fact that the player boards are not this way too. Consistency please!
-Structures: fun and easy addition
-Properties: good addition, but has a misprint and needs to be stickered.
-I haven't played with anything else as I believe most consider it to not make the game better (with the possible exception of the special workers and solo option)
-Ignore the fake attempt at Legacy and just treat things as modules

"Woo! I have everything Viticulture now and it's decent!"

Now Viticulture Essentials edition is released as they're making Tuscany as originally printed OOP
-2nd edition + M&P, New Visitors, Properties, Solo Option
-Where is the new board?! That's Essential!
-A slight few cards are slightly revised/errated, just to be annoying
-A new rule is introduced regarding the Tasting room. Have the old player boards from 1st or 2nd edition? Too bad, so sad.
-By the way, the new visitor cards don't have the annoying "advanced _______" in the title. 
-Bet you want to upgrade. Especially if you missed out on Tuscany.

If you didn't get Tuscany and have the 2nd edition, you don't have to get another edition, because the upgrade pack exists. It still won't fix your player boards for the new Tasting Room rule though. It will fix some of the issues with Tuscany.

Since people want the new board and other aspects of Tuscany... Tuscany Essentials Edition is announced:
-New board: not glossy this time (just to annoy first edition owners of Tuscany)
-Structures: good
-Special workers: apparently good
-Who knows what slight tweaks they could make to the workers and structures between now and when it's released.

Savvy business model you have going there Stonemaier Games.

If you got into the product at the Essential's level, that's fine. Well, it's mostly fine. I say this because if you actually wanted a deeper game with some of the Tuscany modules such as Aboriculture/Fromaggio, you're out of luck. Maybe they'll realease it in another edition: "Viticulture: Hard Core Grapes," or some other renamed edition. Do you see how many iterations and changes this has made since the game launched like 2 years ago? It's ridiculous. How about what I actually thought of the game?

Well, the mamas/papas aren't very appealing to me despite sometimes enjoying asymmetric games (ie Marco Polo). For example, "yay, I have a sparkling wine order card that won't be useful for many turns." I also didn't like the almost forced build-up of workers in the early game. Why can't we just all start with a specific number? At least people can't be blocked from getting workers because of the Grande worker. While the Visitor cards have been tweaked to be good at both the beginning and end of the game, some still seem way better than others. Then there's the randomness of which Vine cards you receive. I will say that I love the Tuscany board and the turn order mechanism. I thought it was also interesting how the grapes turned into wine, how they age, and properly managing your property. Overall, it's a decent game, but there are so many better worker placement games out there in my humble opinion. Even if I wanted to explore it more to see if I would grow to love it, I'm worried where the publisher is going to take the product line with how its managed things so far.

Great worker placement game with a convincing theme, attractive components with a fresh art style and colour scheme, and just the right complexity/weight/length that we like.  Some really nice ideas. 

Note essential second edition changes, which include official rule changes & errata to 1st edition: http://www.stonemaiergames.com/second-edition-viticulture/ (plus [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/34233/viticulture/drivethrurundown-14-viticulture-2nd-edition-micro]video overview[/url])

Playing with grande worker is essential, it no longer has both abilities from Arboriculture expansion, but only ability to be placed at full action spaces (see discussion [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/14725358#14725358]here[/url]).

FAQ: http://www.stonemaiergames.com/faq-viticulture/
Expansion planned for Jan/Feb 2014 via Kickstarter, including improved 2nd edition elements

Ongoing concerns (mostly minor):
- cards are circumstantial and not balanced, some luck of the draw (mostly addressed by expansion visitors)
- too much money at game end, in part due to residual payments, which seem to add unnecessary chrome and money ([thread=982440]discussion[/thread])
- Cottage overpowered in comparison to Windmill/Tasting Room ([thread=1118112]discussion[/thread])
- scoring track artificially capped at 25 points ([thread=1111660]discussion[/thread]) - note: no longer this limit in latest edition

Given excessive money at game end, I recommend Sky Zero's [thread=982955]suggested variant[/thread] where players get 1VP for every 10 lira at the game end.

Length: 30 minutes a person.  3 player games almost always end in the 7th round.

Our house rules:
- play with grande worker
- don't cap scoring at 25 points
- 1VP for every 10 lira at game end (not necessary with Tuscany expansion?)

Rule changes (see discussion [thread=1428746]here[/thread]) in the Essential edition, which also contains the Mamas/Papas expansion, Properties expansion, Automa expansion, and a new mix of 76 visitor cards from Viticulture/Tuscany: ([url=http://stonemaier-games.myshopify.com/pages/viticulture-essential-campaign]source[/url])
[q]Yes, two small changes that are "official," but it's also not imperative that you play with them. 
The first is that there's no longer a 25-point max in any version of Viticulture. 
The second is that if you want to gain the 1 VP bonus from a tasting room, you need to have at least 1 wine token in your cellar. You don't do anything with the token--it just needs to be in the cellar, representing a cask from which guests can sample wine when they visit the tasting room. This change is meant to stymie strategies that try to completely avoid making wine while still making elements of those strategies viable.[/q]
Two other changes: 
- the wording on the Promoter card has changed from "and" to "or".
- The Homesteader card has changed from a $1 discount to a $3 discount.

RATING: 6
This is a medium weight game with a slight twist to worker placement that I’m suspecting must be played with some of the Tuscany elements to be refined to my liking. I’ve yet to try them, so that’s just a guess. Without any expansion refinements, I find it an OK game but nothing inspiring me to think about between plays. Moreover, I find some of the aspects unrefined. 

The innovation here is that there are two worker placement phases on a turn, summer and winter. You can place all your guys in summer or hold some (or all) back to place in winter. That and the Grande worker whom you can place in an already occupied spot. Chaining your actions in summer and winter is mildly interesting, and I appreciate the workaround provided by the Grande worker.

Much less interesting are the cards. On one hand, this is a very tight, strategic game. On the other, card draws can put a lot of wind behind your back or in your face. Players who get fortuitous draws will feel like the game is much easier than those who get the “Well this is useless” cards. Mixing such a tight game with so much randomness is a tough act to pull off; I’m not convinced Viticulture does it. This is an efficiency game so having to draw more cards to get useful ones is not the answer. Each card should be sellable for coins or something to mitigate poor draws. 

The other aspect that I think needs addressed is turn order. The game ostensibly offers a classic “the lady or the loot?” proposition in terms of turn order position or bonus for turn order spot. Don’t be misled – turn order is much more important than the bonuses offered as they’re too weak. You want to go farther down in order and draw a card that may very well be useless to you? Not worth it.

All in all, I’ll keep the game for a few plays but I doubt this is a long-term game for me – unless the Tuscany expansion adds some elements that open the game up in ways that mitigate the weaknesses.

After many more plays upping rating to 8.  

5 plays so far, solid game.  
Pros=scales very well between 2-6 players.  Theme goes well with mechanics
Cons=can be very long with new players. It goes very quickly from not enough money in the game to do what you need to way more money than you could spend.  It takes too long to make money other that tours and taking the lira spot in the turn order.  But still a solid game that can be played in 1 hour ish with 2 people.  I own the 2nd edition, and like the visitor cards with it better than the essential edition cards.  I think the mamas and papas cards should be enough to speed it up without making it too much of a hand management game.

Interesting theme, getting the card flow going is a key aspect.

This is probably my favorite worker placement game right now (Sept 2015), a true gem, especially with some of the Tuscany modules thrown in.

Downgraded simply because I now own the Essential Edition which contains this as well as the couple of Tuscany add-ons that are 'must plays'.  Essential Edition is now a 10.

Nincs benne semmi igazán új, de valahogy nagyon egyben van az egész. Mind a hangulat, mind a mechanizmusok egy kerek egészt adnak. A játékidő is pont jó. Sokan panaszkodnak a visitorok randomságára. Tényleg vannak olyanok, amik a játék elején jók és a végén haszontalanok, nomeg persze fordítva is, és ez visz némi szerencsefaktort a játékba. Mondjuk ugyanez igaz a célkártyákra is. Szerintem annyira amúgy nem zavaró, mert elég rövid a játék ahhoz, hogy ennyi beleférjen, bár valóban kicsit furcsa egy munkáslehelyezős játékban ennyi szerencse. De ha valakit nagyon zavarna, az se baj, mert az egyik kieg. modul lecseréli a kártyákat csupa olyanra, aminek dupla képessége van, hogy bármikor használható legyen.
-------
Az alapjáték azért sok egyensúlytalansággal rendelkezik, amiket a Tuscany kieg javít. Így a kieg. must have kategóriásnak tűnik ennél a játéknál. Viszont vele szuper jó játék lesz.

Viticulture is a less ambitious game than the designer's other release from 2013, Euphoria. Most of its features are standard worker placement fare. Maybe because of this, it's also the better game.

At the same time, it still repeats some of the same issues that plagued Euphoria, e.g. the very situational and swingy card effects. Turn order, even though it is advertised to be "player's choice", is exceedingly important in the final turn(s), and sitting at the front of the queue at that point is a clear advantage. That you can sit on piles of money towards the end of the game with nothing to spend it for is another obvious misstep. I understand the expansion tries to alleviate this problem but quite generally speaking, this doesn't exactly help to dissolve the image of Kickstarter games being underdeveloped and not playtested enough.

Just played this for my birthday last night.  While some of the rules were a little muddy for my non gamer hubby, over all we had fun with this.  He got bored with the cycle of the year over and over again, but once grapes started to produce it got a lot easier and more fun.  This game can be quite the meaty chew for a non gamer to understand, but the artwork and components are so well done its worth it.  The rulebook is well done, but I found the harvesting and wine making a little confusing.  I look forward to picking up tuscany, which I hear is wonderful!!

It is a nice light workerplacement game you can propably play with people who don't play games that often. But some aspects which make it good for that make it less good for me. There is significant luckfactor in which cards you draw at which time. The fact that you have the big worker who can do already blocked actions makes the workerplacing aspect less interesting.
There are some aspectsregarding theme which make me cry - you get rosé by mixing red and white whine? Really?!?

The core mechanisms are interesting but the cards in this game are so horribly unbalanced that it breaks the game. Tried playing a second time without the cards but that was a pretty boring experience.

Also, why does every player start with a vine in his/her hand that he/she cannot plant unless he/she constructs a trellis? There are vines in the game that do not require any buildings at all; surely these would be much better suited for starting vines.

RATING: 7
(Rating based on the Essential edition)

I didn't know what to expect from Viticulture as I had read very little about it. I found a rather straightforward worker placement game that nonetheless does the mechanic quite well. A decent engine of growing grapes, harvesting those grapes, and then making them into wine to fulfill Order cards. It would be as straightforward as that if it wasn't for the Customer cards that is the main way players can break rules and do extra things they normally wouldn't be able to do. Again, not an idea that hasn't been done to death already, but Viticulture is well-enough designed that it holds your interest the whole time and keeps the tension riding at a steady pace. I also like the ability to buy improvements as an action and sacrifice engine operation to facilitate engine building. Some of the Customer cards are a little too much "take that" for me and randomly hit the "player on your left" or "right", which I thought a little mean. Why not just target the leader or someone with an advantage? Punishing a player that could be in last place isn't very nice. Otherwise, I'm not sure at this point we needed another straightforward worker placement game but Viticulture is an excellent example of the genre nonetheless.

RATING: 7.5
I liked it! It feels VERY similar to Caverna (and to a lesser extent, Agricola). Note that I played with 5 players, the game might be a lot tighter with fewer.

Pros: 
Pretty streamlined feel - the game made sense pretty quickly.
Lovely components - I really liked the glass magnifying beads and the meeples were nice too.

Cons:
The cards drawn are of wildly varying power - the winner in our game drew a card which gave him 9 gold on T1 and then again on T3 allowing him to build all the workers and buildings he could want far earlier than anyone else.
Similarly, drawing the correct wine order cards mattered a LOT. Definitely a real bummer - it would have been much more balanced to have communal wine orders that anyone could fulfill.

Ugly:
There were a couple of really weird thematic breaks. 
The first - did you know champagne is two red wines and a white wine mixed together? Hm.
The second - why can a cellar only store one wine of a particular quality? Quite bizarre.
Last but not least, the bizarre final scoring where victory points are capped followed by several layers of tiebreakers. Definitely an interesting mechanism (forcing players to try to focus on several secondary objectives beyond VP), but pretty counter-intuitive as those objectives would not factor in at all if the player did not reach max VP.

Verdict: I would play again if asked, but would choose to play other worker placements (Caverna in particular) if given the choice.

RATING: 8
I worker placement production game, like many other with not much of a theme or special mechanics or anything, but it works well and is fun to play. 

+ Nice to use workers in summer or save them for winter. 
+ Good to get a bonus to do an action first and that you have a special worker that always can be placed even if all spaces are full.
+ Good to get to pick a player order and get something for picking laater spots. 
+ Easy to understand process of main VP production (take wine card, plant wine, harwest, make wine, complete mission) ...and some other small ways to get VP that are also good.
+ Good components.
+ Guest cards are great, with many different special actions that are very useful. 


- Too long down time with 5 players. Think it is best on 3, would not play it with more then 4 again. 
- Easy to make up plan for rest of the year and then you have to wait for a long time for others to play. 
- Almost too easy to get more workers so that in 5 player game turns take too long and it is hard to keep track of what you should to with all workers, if you have all. 
- Too much randomness with drawing a card as action. Cards very from very useful to not useful at all, it should be much better of this randomness could be mitigated somehow. Draw 2 pick 1, complete any of the 4 common missions to get VP also, not only card you draw....
- Randomness force players to adjust strategy to get the most out of the cards rather then playing the strategy they want....actually that might be a good thing for replayability. :)
- Some actions are very good in the beginning and others in the end. Almost too obvious how to play, so that winner is the one who has most luck with draw...atleast among players who are good. 
- After playing one time some things seam too good. Selling a field in the beginning and building a cottage and another worker for the money almost feels like a must do. In a way I don´t think was intended.

RATING: 8
Played with the Tuscany expansion this is a fascinating Euro where every action is important and there are multiple paths to victory. Feels fast and the mechanic of choosing player order (like Alchemists) balanced by benefits for later playtimes is fascinating. Generic pastel farm art is not my style.  WIth higher player counts you can get locked out of vital actions - there is tight competition for locations.  Depending on who you're playing with and their play stile, this can be frustrating.  Still, a very interesting, thematic Euro.

I don't understand the praise here.  Maybe ten years ago, even five, but today this game is a slog through pointless mechanics.  The length to pay out is poor.  The theme is poor.  The narrative arch is poor.  The game is an extended tactical solitary experience.  There is minimal progression.  I believe with the right card draws you can be just as successful building no infrastructure as you can making huge advancements.  

Ultimately it is the pacing to depth of play ratio, and Viticulture fails.  If I want Tactical games with nice decision space and card play I will chose a Colovini game (and it will end in a quarter of the time).

Christmas 2014 gift from my wife, can't wait to play it!

--
Extremely fun game, and although the various Summer and Winter visitor cards can add some imbalances to the game, the flexibility of the Grande workers help to ensure that there's never the "Agricola" situation where players are blocked from taking any beneficial action whatsoever.

So far I've played both with 4 and with 2 players, and both of which have been quite fun if very different feeling. I am not sure how the game would feel at 6, however I'm not averse to trying as the game does play does feel considerably different at 2 players than it does at 4.

Although I need more plays under my belt, I would put Viticulture on par with Lords of Waterdeep & Scoundrels of Skullport expansion, although I think Viticulture would edge it out in the end.

Utterly tremendous marriage of theme to worker placement game play. Lots of worker placement games do similar things/actions, but somehow the winery locale really puts you there. Different structures allow for a variety of functions, planting vines will bring more harvests with which to make different wines, which wines will age better, visitors can be put to use... and more. Play the film "Sideways" while playing...

This is currently my favorite worker placement game.  The base game is a solid 8 for me, but I will never play again without the Tuscany expansion.  This brings the game to a 10 easily.  I have yet to play with anyone who has not enjoyed the game.

Very well designed worker placement game. It is all about wine making in private winery. Very thematic - every action has it's own associated work in real life. Even victory points are like measure for reputation of wine maker. Excellent theme and beautiful components and aesthetics.

Finally hit the table last night. First game took too long as we figured out what the hell we were doing, but we immediately played a second time and brought the play time down to about an hour for a 3p game.

There's a lot to like here. Interesting worker placement game, with a decent thematic implementation. 

Hard-core gamers might be annoyed at the luck of the card draws because the card valuations aren't all that consistent, especially when you consider what phase of the game (i.e. early vs. late) you are in. Personally, it didn't bother me in a game of this length.

I look forward to playing it a few more times and then trying out the Tuscany expansions.

Opinion: well, for me is another worker placement game, which I love, but nothing else than that. I enjoyed the game, and the idea of playing summer and winter is nice. But, unless you like the theme (and is like other euros), the rest is a good worker placement, with anything else to add

RATING: N/A
Played once before the expansion but haven't had a chance to try it again since. It seemed like there is definitely a predictable set of first moves that everyone wants to make, and it's a huge bottleneck on one or two spaces until everything sorts out a little. Having one or two players who don't really understand the game kind of breaks it for other players.

A very well done euro-style worker placement game. Nothing groundbreaking in the mechanics, but they're very well executed, and the the theme is nicely integrated. Like any good worker placement game, you always want to do just a little bit more than you're able to each turn. Turn order is a huge factor, and every victory point is critical.

The game I played came down to the last round for three of the four players. It took us way longer than the estimated playing time, but that was mostly due to  analysis paralysis by first time players.

RATING: 7.5
Good game. It's similar to Agricola minus the food. The expansion ain't that good though, not worth buying since it bring nothing to the main game.

I like the fact that you are blocking each other on the board just like Agricola.

It is also a well balanced game that does not go on forever.

I might buy it eventually, but since i have Agricola, I am in no hurry... will buy Caverna before this game.

A solid worker placement game with some fun competition. The theme and production quality are great. I guess my score is a little rough but that's primarily because, at least 2-player, it feels kind of random in terms of getting the right orders with the right vines. It'd be nice if instead there was a market for orders, so when you draw one you can pick from those. Looking forward to trying Tuscany

First thing you notice about this game is the quality of the components, high quality wooden pieces, great card stock boards and lovely art work.

The game is the most peaceful worker placement game i have played. Multiple ways to win, many strategies, and high replay value.

Standard worker placement mechanic, with one exception the mega meeple which unlike other worker placements allow a otherwise occupied slot to be used.

Cons: Some of the visitors are overly specific, and can either be over powered or completely useless depending on when they come out in the game.  

A solid, well balanced game. Best enjoyed with a smaller group and a glass of wine (or 2).

RATING: 3
Pretty standard worker placement game that copies the turn order mechanic from "Fresco". The only novelty is that each round has two placement phases with different action spaces, and the players must split their workers between them. It could have been a decent game if it had been better developed, but unfortunately it is unbalanced and severed flawed.

Luck of the draw is huge. Many cards may be overpowered or useless depending on the circumstances. There is also the strange rule that puts a limit on victory points and thus can make a less effective player win via tie-breaker.

However, the worst problem is that a player's performance is extremely dependent on timing the end of the game and on what he can do in the final round, but the essential action that converts vines to victory points is limited, invariably being unavailable to one or two players. This also puts a lot of weight in turn order, and choosing the earlier spots for wake-up time in the late game is automatic.

The game is still playable, but with all the flaws, I see no reason to choose it over any of the countless better designed games with similar mechanics.

Easily one of the smoothest worker placement games I've played.  The grape/wine crafting and aging mechanics are interesting and I enjoy the split between the summer/winter sides of the board.  My only real con is that the randomness of depending on cards for both growing and objectives can be a little frustrating.

Played with the 2nd edition rules and some stuff from the expansion.

Where to begin with? Well, if I cut out all the stuff from the expansion, there isn't much left, but a WP game that we already have thousands of.

It works and while the cards give the game a good replayability, their effects vary way to much (played with new cards, not the original ones)!

The game as it is, without the expansion, just can't compete nowadays.

RATING: 7.5
A game that genuinely makes you feel that you are making wine. You feel that each step has a long term impact. There were some moments in the first game where we felt like we didn't know what to do, kinda stumped by the board, but ended up feeling a sense of accomplishment at the end of the game.

I've been interested in playing this (as well as [thing=42052][/thing]) for a while now and am very glad I got a chance to do so at the 2015 Congress of Gamers. I played the latest version with the [thing=147101]Tuscany[/thing] expansion and had a good time even though I came dead last. We did play with 6 and although initially it felt that the pacing was going to be good, it did drag on between turns. Still, I would definitely like to play this again and wouldn't mind having a copy in the future.

RATING: 8.5
Great game!

A bit overwhelming to new players due to how almost each WP spot needs a brief introduction. The beginning of the game is very slow (typically several rounds with no points gained), but the end game is almost frantic; this provides a satisfying experience, but it also makes it very hard to assess whether your engine is going to work as intended and I suppose that might lead to some frustration for inexperienced players.

Messze a legdrágább játékom. A kiegészítővel együtt 24 ezer forintba került. Szeretem a borászos játékokat (Vinhos, Grand Crue) és ez is nagyon jól hozza a hangulatot így ezt is szeretem nagyon, bár elég kiegyensúlyozatlannak tartom. Például 6 lépés: szőlő kártya vásárlása, 2 ültetés, szüret, bor készítése, célkártya kijátszása, eredmény 3 pont. Másik megoldásban egy jó sárga kártya kijátszásával egy elültetett szőlő kivágása 4 pontot hoz. 
De akárhogy dohogok mindig előveszem, mert nagyon szép és nagyon jó játék.

This seems to be what the market wants these days: an attractive theme, great components, but a game that's fundamentally based on luck. This is a worker placement game themed around making wine (duh), but it's based around drawing and playing cards. Your vine cards may be great vintage or total plonk, your visitor cards useful or not, your order cards could be easy early game fulfilment or very tough to do (most likely the latter). There's also a rich get richer element, the early lead gets you regular income, saving you an action each turn. By the end of the game I'd run out of things to do. Designers publishing their own games is often a big, flashing warning light. This just confirms my suspicions.

Beautiful art of vineyard landscape on game board.  Good components.  Player mats curled before our eyes during first play!  This is the THE worker placement Euro game with the richest theme permeated throughout, with the cards and their effects.  The theme is thick and frothy with the mechanics of the game play.  I felt like the game weight was extra heavy and the the game took too long to play for what it is.  Making wine is a long, onerous  many step process!  Overall, I enjoyed the game and it made me want a glass of wine.  I would like it more if it was a little lighter and took less time to complete the game.  This is NOT a gateway game!! LoL

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Viticulture is a great entry point to both worker placement and euro games. It's especially useful for gamers who are either new to the hobby, or are not well versed in the mechanics of modern gaming.

Firstly, it's beautiful. I have the metal coins and all the fun trinkets, and when the game is in progress, it's delightful to see. People will come over to find out what game it is, simply because it looks so stunning. This can be overlooked on occasion by seasoned gamers, but I've found that people who are not committed to the hobby will buy in much more readily if the game is immediately legible.

Second, it's a friendly introduction to what can be a pretty mean genre of games. Regardless of what you do in Viticulture, the game will reward you. You will receive money, wine, and cards, even if you are in the process of trainwrecking. The trick is in finding out how to get rewarded more than the other players. This is useful, since it avoids a situation like Agricola where everyone else has animals and crops pouring in, and you are starving to death in your tiny hut. 

The mechanic of the grande meeple is also ideal for an entry to the genre, since it gives players a way to ensure they can take at least one action that they desperately need. New players will use the grande as an "oh crap" tool to avoid crashing when someone takes a spot they weren't expecting them to take. Seasoned players will use it as a way to plan out their turns to take advantage of turn order, so that they can come back to actions later than they "should" be able to.

I enjoy the rhythm of the game as well. You want to set yourself up to be doing all parts of the wine-making sequence slightly off tempo of the other players. This is a fun little dance, and it's added to by the visitor cards letting you skip or condense some actions to realign yourself to others' timing.

Lastly, I like that you can win the game with a variety of strategies. You don't have to make wine to win, and while this can be a stumbling block for new players, it's also a nice extra wrinkle that lets people engage with the game in their own way.

Now to be fair, I don't think Viticulture is especially challenging or engaging from a strategic perspective. The decision space isn't particularly huge, and there aren't a ton of ways to make big gains over others. That being said, there is a ton of game space in the expansions that I haven't looked at yet, and even if it's not a true test of skill, it's still very enjoyable to sit back and relax. Very few worker placement games leave me feeling relaxed and calm after they are done, so for that alone, Viticulture is worth a spot in my collection.

Like the name of the game, Viticulture shows the manufacturing process of grape and wine farming. The game has successfully combiend beautiful artwork with nice game mechanics. The principles of game is worker placement and order & delivery. The game system provides more harsh competition on even number players playing than that of odd number players game. A remarkable drawback of the game is card luck. The game is frequently influenced by card power. While compared with another wine theme game, Vinhos, the game Viticulture has much more simple rules and better looking artwork. I agree that Viticulture is a better choice than Vinhos. Let me keep comparing Viticulture to another famous game, Fresco. In fact, Viticulture reminds me the game Fresco in many ways. Especially, the relations of time and turn order in Viticulture are just the same idea as Fresco. Fresco turn order system is well working in Viticulture too. However, as I pointed out above, the card system of Viticulture often deteriorates the game mechanism. Sometimes, the game appearance is changed like a card luck testing game. Even though the game rule was revised in a few ways, the game mechanics is still the same. Card luck is the biggest part of determining game aspects. Generally, Viticulture is a well-made worker placement game with wine theme. However, Viticulture is not really noticeable. The game mechanics are based on other previous masterpieces. Viticulture is lack of originality in game mechanics and theme. I am certain Viticulture is a good game, but less than a outstanding work.

this game has several major problems:
1) it's pot luck whether the cards you draw are of any use
2) a lot of event cards are only useful early or late
3) the game is incredibly tight in 2/4/6 player, thankfully the grande worker helps, but still i'd rather play 3/5 player (new worker placement spaces only open up with 3 and 5 players)
4) money is incredibly tight early game, by the time you get it from residual income, it's not much use unless you get lucky with a money -> vp event card
5) the turn order mechanic is bad (who gets to place on the turn order track rotates anti-clockwise each round)
6) finally, it's just a very average game, with some interesting mechanics (the wine harvesting/aging/making) thrown in

The Tuscany expansion fixes most of the problems and adds some very interesting new mechanics, to a point where the game is actually really good!

I have rated this game including the Tucany expansion, but unfortunately half of it should have been in the base game. The expansion and base game together are incredibly expensive just to find out whether the game is any good or not, most people of course would rightly be put off by the base game alone.

Edit: The newest 2015? edition of the base game includes some of tuscany (havn't looked into which bits) so the base game should no longer be so bad on it's own now.

Has a fairly standard worker placement mechanism.

It's a pretty competitive game, and it can be frustrating when someone blocks you either intentionally or unintentionally. In that regard the gameplay is a bit like Agricola.

The rate at which you gain victory points increases exponentially. You'll spend over an hour going from 0 to 10 points, then 15 minutes going from 10 to 20 points, and one turn going from 20 to 30 points.

The Collector's Edition was expensive, but I'm glad I bought it.

Not a bad economic engine building worker placement... this 1st edition I played however the rule booked sucked.  I also agree that the "guest" cards are not evenly balanced, and in late game more and more become worthless.  Also agree the wine order cards should have a "starting" set so some players don't get orders impossible to fill to mid/late game giving folks with easy orders quick advance not only on VP but income.

Very excellent worker placement. Expansion adds more than it maybe needs to, but separating the seasons is pretty awesome. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Game is split into summer and winter halves. It seemed like in the early game, some spaces on the summer side were hotly contested after the first round or two. Then, they did nothing in the middle game, then it transitions to players crowding for the same winter spots to convert grapes to wine to scoring or playing cards.

Card draws are very random. From crummy 1 value red wines, to 4's for the same cost to plant. Visitor cards are all over the place. One I played early game was awesome. Others were crappy. The powered up blue cards were interesting but all over the place.

Game has a funnel effect where you can tell where people are going to from round to round so it is all very predictable. The same choice spots are on everyone's wish list so you run out of things to do quickly when worker spots are used up and your extra workers that you purchased are standing around doing nothing except picking up 1 gold apiece.

It is too random for my tastes and it should really be played with 3 or 5 players since it opens up a fair amount of spots for the # of players.

Another generic worker placement game with dead spots of nothing to do, through no fault of your own (due to random card draws and 1 or 2 spots that everyone wants). There's no "plan B" in this game, either you can do what you want to do, or your game state locks up. Other players' engines get going more and next thing you know, the game is over because one person scored a couple of big scoring cards and made it to the final scoring spot.

I must add that the soft cap of 25 points for everyone is odd and seems like a simple fix for the volatile scoring due to random card draw scoring cards that some players may get over yours by pure luck. 25 points scored by one or more players signals the game end. The players finish their turns in round order. Did you score enough for 32 points? Too bad, you get 25. I think this is in place because the designers knew that the scoring can get out of hand if 1-2 players get the right combo of easy scoring cards that can spike and imbalance things. I don't understand why this is in here. It just feels like a fix that was put in place during testing to keep things competitive but was not later removed because they couldn't think up a better way to fix the scoring issues.

2/2016 update: If you like this, make sure to buy Viticulture Essentials base game plus Tuscany. Both are available. It makes it a much better game since each season gets played instead of half and half. It should have been this way in the base game. In a 3 player game, there weren't really any bottlenecks like in the regular base game. There are also new workers that cost more to hire that mimick the big guy piece so that you can go to occupied spaces more easily and more often. Much better game ending - there is a soft cap of 25 points, but the ceiling is at 40. Unlike the base game which is a nonsensical 20/25. The card balance seems better with Tuscany. The question is, do you want to pay $130 retail for a playable game that should have been this way at half the cost.

RATING: 9
Great game with a great theme. Solid worker-placement with some fun card play. Becomes fantastic with the expansion.

The thing keeping this from a 10 is that, and this goes for all of Jamey Stegmaiers games, I do not feel like I'm progressing in his games. Even though I get some bonuses or something they are usually so small and don't impact the game that much so it dosen't really change the way I play. That lack of progression is what makes it not reach full marks.

RATING: 8
Excellent worker placement game that anyone can enjoy. Once you throw in some of the Tuscany bits you can play this as a gateway all the way to a much heavier game. It has been a big hit every time it has hit the table

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2015)

I Kickstarted Viticulture along with Tuscany, as is usual from me, I did it without any knowledge about the games, but when I found out Viticulture and Euphoria´s designer was the same guy, I thought I have made a mistake. I really dislike Euphoria. However I was pleasantly surprised and now I´m glad to have Viticulture in my game collection. I only have played the 2nd edition rules and I don’t know what changes were made between them. I’m also not sure if all the game components are the same or if the KS edition has better components.

Viticulture is a gorgeous worker placement game. The components are great (although some wooden components came glued together and when I took them apart some paint peeled off :() and the gameplay offers interesting decisions (how many meeples should I play in each season? Which space to play? Which position do I want to have this turn? Should I make wine now or should I wait to get better quality later?). The game comes with a special meeple (Grande) which can be used in any occupied space, thank to this you can be assured that you can do the action you need, so it lessens the tension of the game, however it allows you to pull of your plan most of the time. I’m still not sure how I feel about this. 

The main issue for me, is that I feel Viticulture has a big chunk of uncontrolled luck with the cards (the blue visitors seem very powerful) which is a big negative for me in a long strategy game. Another minor dislike is that the game victory point track is capped at 25 points. I think this will lead to ties that otherwise would have been avoided. 
 
I feel a wine enthusiast would enjoy the game even more, but for me the theme is irrelevant. I’m not a fan of wines. However I have to recognize that the theme and game mechanisms do work well together and you feel it throughout the game.

Bottom line, I enjoy the game a lot right now and I want to play it again. I hope the luck of the cards won´t be that big of an issue for me. Viticulture is a good wine WP game, but Vinhos is still king for me in this category.

Current rating: 7.0

After another play I realized two things: 1. My desire to play Viticulture isn’t that high and 2. I have an issue with the visitor cards, they provide too much  uncontrollable luck.

I’m also kind of bothered at the new changes Stonemaier Games decided to do for the new edition (Viticulture Essential Edition). In the new edition the VPs aren’t capped at 25 and if you want to win a VP from the Tasting Room you need to have at least one wine in your cellar (this have a huge impact on game strategy). They also changed some cards. In general, I approve of the changes, but I HEAVILY dislike that this is the third time in 2 years and a half since they published the game that they change core rules for it. They changed some rules from 1st edition to 2nd edition and now once more to the essential edition. They also did the same thing with Euphoria and that behavior seems to indicate that Stonemaier Games do very little playtesting before releasing their games (after all they are a KS fueled company). I’m not pleased with this so I will beware of this publisher in the future. I think they shouldn’t change the core rules of previously (and successfully) released games, instead they should be added as official variants or to the next expansion of the game (Moor Visitors). To summarize, I find disrespectful to change the rules of the game so much in a short timeframe. Had I backed the first edition on KS I would be very angry indeed. 

My SO loves the game so I’m keeping it for now but I’m thinking about selling it. I also have yet to play with Tuscany to see if it improves the game for me.

Due to all of these issues, I’m downgrading Viticulture´s rating.

Viticulture is no longer among my favorite games of 2013.

Another solid worker-placement euro.  There are a few paths to focus on (or dabble in each). Ultimately, as with all other euros, you must earn points. The idea of planting grapes, then harvesting them, to creating wine is fun. But remember to do so to complete your orders. It maintains a 7 for now, but I'm not interested in owning it. My one full play saw two people struggle with poor card draws that really saw the fun removed. Curious to see if Sean's copy gets more table time...won't be requested by us anytime soon.

Rating based on around 12-15 plays, some with the base game that came out in 2013, then in 2015 I began to add elements from the Tuscany expansion.  (Did not like how Tuscany was marketed, as I had to wind up buying a third item which included the Grande worker that did not come with the original Viticulture).  Anyway, I find Viticulture to be an interesting twist on worker placement games, borrowing heavily from the Wake-Up/turn order mechanism in Fresco, but with alot of luck as many of the cards you can draw are stronger than others.  But, I have become comfortable now playing Viticulture with the expanded board (four seasons) as well as the Grande, special workers, special buildings, Influence and Mamas and Papas, basically most of the Tier 1-Tier 2 stuff without the differing endgame bonuses or anything from Tier 3.  Kind of like Kingsburg in the sense that there are some elements from Tuscany that definitely improve the original, but other elements you can certainly do without.  Still, a challenging game but did not appreciate the fact that Stonemaier did not throw in the Grande pieces with the Tuscany expansion that was already selling for around $60 and way overpriced.

One play down of the base game with 2 players after receiving the collector's box.  I was worried as to whether this would be a good investment or not, but I can now say that I am quite relieved. 

The game is very good -- Perhaps even excellent.  Both my friend and I really enjoyed the first play and are already looking forward to playing it again soon.  

So far, all I can say is the production is excellent.  The bits are gorgeous and the game works.  More on mechanics and other specific comments after another play.

played through half a game with 3.  ran a bit long and a little less fun than the first time, but still quite solid.  looking forward to adding the Tuscany stuff  and we will see where that takes us.

This definitely has some interesting elements with the worker placement and the theme of planting and harvesting grapes and converting them to wine.

Great strategy game. I like the worker placement style and that you need to plan the workers either for summer or for winter. also some suprise and variety because of the guests.
On the downside: a bit too much luck for my taste. It can give you quite some (dis)advantages wich cards you get. also I would prefer mechanism that help the last player(s). Sth. like who passes first becomes the next start player. Also Iˋd prefer if players could draft or choose the starting cards.

The more expansions that get added, the more I like it. It's a fun game but the luck of the cards plays a major role. You spend half the game producing wine to earn four points, your opponent draws a card that gives him three points just for spending nine bucks. Plus, it always seems, just when you get an engine going, the game ends. Beautiful game. I'm looking forward to trying more of the expansions. A lot of them seem to belong in the "base" game.

My absolute favorite.

I have sat and played this game so many times with my wife, often back to back.

All my friends I've introduced to it enjoy it, even though the intro seemed clunky (my fault).  Well...I'm not 100% my brother and his wife liked it as much.  I hadn't had a chance to learn it myself, and it was a slow intro with lots of questions.  The second game I won without ever filling an order, because I  was testing other strategies.  They still requested it again, though.

It's easily my favorite game, and part of the reason my others are rated a little lower.  It is in comparison to this.

Attempted to teach family. Pretty painful. Stark reminder that this is a gamer's game.  Worker placement games in general are very hard to teach due to the gigantic info dump required to explain all the available actions.

I like it and want to play it more with a face up card drafting system like Ticket to Ride for the decks.

I have the first edition and I think it has been essentially abandoned.  The last time I tried to play the game with someone who has the Essential edition I couldn't figure out if we were playing correctly or not because there are so many little tweaks to the rules.  My feeling on Viticulture is that the publisher uses the first edition as a Beta to refine the rules.  They are also more interested in little promos in the kickstarter than on getting the rules correct.  Because of this, I hesitate to play (let alone buy) any Stonemaier game.

The cards are very badly balanced against each other, and the game plays terribly with four players.

Group gave the game another shot after without me, and the problems were still there apparently.

Fascinating gameplay. Its 'two part worker placement' just fits well in the game.

Only if the cards were more balanced & there was something to compensate for when you draw something which you simply cannot use as it leaves a bad after-taste of wasting your action, i.e. when you already have max. workers & the card lets you buy them cheap. 

Maybe a mechanism of take two discard/return the other would help? On the other hand it might disturb the flow of the game.

Also why so few summer cards? It seemed to me you need them the most (that is mainly at start).

For sure you will find me playing it again :)

I love this game so much, and not just because I love winemaking in real life. In fact, probably despite that. The game makes some concessions to reality in order to make for good gameplay, and it works, so I don't mind. The theme is fun, the art is beautiful, and the gameplay relatively straightforward. It was a bit slow learning from the rules, but has sped up considerably after the first play.

Very aggressive when played with 2 players. Fun mechanics, but the tradeoffs can be extreme when only 2 players are playing and are aiming for a similar path. The grande worker (from the Arboriculture extension) would alleviate this a bit, we'll try it next time we play.

Looking for a light/med Euro to get my SO into WP games and this gem stood out above the fray. Though, I did play this as a 6 player and did not enjoy it at all. The card play was way too random (I didn't draw a white grapes the entire game) and I wasted too many turns trying to balance my game out. After the 3rd time of hopelessly drawing vine cards, I realized that there was literally nothing I could do to get back in the game and that was extremely frustrating. I felt that the game not only put lucky card drawers in good position, but punished bad draws in which there was no recovering from. I'd want to play a 4 player game before making a final judgement.

Very rigid structure for a wine producing game. Yes, there is a process, but I want an open avenue to get points. This game has too many random elements to it, in the form of the contract cards I get, to the grapes that I get that don't jive with the contract cards I get. Ultimately, none of it makes any sense to me thematically because of this reason, and I'd rather just play Vinhos forever over this.

I didn't take part in the kickstarter, I never take part in any kickstarters.  But, if I was going to take part, this game has the type of kickstarter reward that would inspire me.  Naming cards after contributors and using art reflective of the contributors is awesome.

The actual game is acceptable.  My main complaint is that the cards are wildly situational.  There are cards that will supercharge the a player if received in the first turn but are useless near the end.  Other cards are worthless at the beginning, but are devastating near the end of the game.  And the cards are powerful, which means that winning will often depend on who gets the better card draw.  

The wooden pieces themselves are very pretty, every piece is different and looks like something.  The glass beads that represent the grapes/wines are, on the other hand, too big, too unwieldy, and not very pretty.

This was a fairly long comment for a game that I only played twice, weird.

Love the idea of the WP game being geared towards a game night with couples.  It saddened me that 6 players didn't really work out for having 2 other couples over to play it. 

Being a Fresco, Stone Age, and overall worker placement Fanatic.  Worker placement is very different from a 2 player to higher player game, and even vs. odd number of players seems to matter more.

Yes I also own Vinhos.  With Viticulture it is a bit easier to comprehend and I like the idea that is more accessible to the non-gamers.

==================================
For New Players:

It is of my opinion, these should be the items required to tell new players of Viticulture:

1) The game is about building a winery, not actually making wine will get you the win, but it will help. 
2) Money is good for getting your engine built, but is not as useful at the end of the game, but it is a decider in tiebreakers. 
3) Your pinot vine you start out with, you can’t plant it until you build something (trellis) that allows you to plant it. 
4) Hold onto cards that can score points in end game siturations. There may be someone that taps out at 20 points early leaving you high and dry. 
5) Those stickers mean nothing; there will be no GMO vines modifying base points in this game. Also don’t you dare think of doing such, this isn’t Risk Legacy.

In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.

The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.

A pure static emplacements worker placement with the theme really shining through.  Well made, a bit fluky on the cards but very pleasant to play.  To me, this sits somewhere in the narrow space between Stone Age and Lord of Waterdeep.  Hopefully the Tuscany expansion will make this into something more, but it still fills a spot as it stands.

If I had choose a wine game to play, this is probably one of the best but there are some improvements that I really wished were implemented or changed.  I do like that there's at least two different paths to victory (vineyard to grapes to wine cellar to order fulfillment vs. vineyard to grapes to sales)

First, this is a Victory Points Euro-game disguised as a wine business game.  Thus, I wished it was more of a business game where winning is about achievement of money/business conditions.  

Second, the order (purple) cards stack should be layered so that the top few cards are "starter" orders or low level fulfillments.  Why?  B/c if you draw 4 order cards, early in the game, and they are all big orders it will take long to fulfill one of them and they block up your hand-size.  

Third, there is no alternative market or free market for grapes and wine (regarding victory points).  Grapes can be sold for money direct from Crushed Bins based upon age.  I wish there was an additional static path of selling wine for victory points. For example, have a free market, similar to the income wheel but in reverse (sell a type of wine and that wine type goes down in VPs).  

It's much easier to implement these added layers if you change the victory conditions to just money rather than have both money and victory points and calling it a business strategy game.  Or, streamline an option that whenever you make money, you must choose how many victory points based on which path you generated that money.  Have different ratios of converting money into victory points, if you want to maintain the game design with both currencies. 

With multiple paths to winning, it cuts the game time down quicker (and makes things less fiddly) b/c there will be more outlets and strategy/exit choices for running a vineyard business.  Selling grapes slowly and steadily versus stockpiling wine to fulfill big orders.

Lastly, some of the cards do not make thematic sense.  The Handyman allows you to deconstruct a building and build a new one as replacement.  If you tear down the Trellis or Irrigation, where will the current grape vines hang or be irrigated in order to produce grapes for you to harvest?

I think I much prefer this game with the Arboriculture expansion.  Not sure why it was made exclusive.  This is a fairly straightforward worker placement game with some nifty pieces.  Not sure if I like how the point track ends at 25 and one cannot score more than 25...anyone on 25 at the end of the game compares gold and whoever has the most wins.  It is a race game to some degree - as soon as someone reaches 20 points, the game is over at the end of the year.  One does have to divide one's workers between the summer and winter seasons - summer tends to be for planting and infrastructure, winter for crushing grapes, fulfilling orders, and hiring workers.  The cards in the game can be a bit swingy but I don't know that they are game breakers (I admit that in my first play I thought some cards others played were much more impressive than mine, but I still won so...)

Ein Arbeitereinsetz Spiel, bei dem man Weinreben anbaut, daraus Wein herstellt und daraus wiederum Siegpunkte generiert.
Eine Runde ist dabei in zwei Hälften geteilt. Man muss sich also entscheiden ob man für spätere Aktionen noch Arbeiter aufhebt oder sie direkt in der ersten Hälfte rausbläst. Weinreben einkaufen geht in der ersten (Frühling), sie einpflanzen ebenso, sie zu ernten und daraus Wein herzustellen aber erst in der zweiten (Herbst)... Schnappt mir das später jemand weg kann ich nicht nochmal zurück und doch noch Reben holen...
Ein schöner Mechanismus, bei dem man den richtigen Twist herausfinden muss. Das Spiel funktioniert wunderbar und auch logisch, was die einzelnen Aktionen so machen. Dennoch sind mir andere AES-Spiele bekannt, die ich lieber spiele.

RATING: 7
I once had this rated as a ten.

I've since reduced it because I've found the cards just introduce too much randomness into the game. 

Once you get past the gorgeous pieces and board, there just isn't enough game there to justify continued plays. It lacks the tension of an Agricola or the epic scale of a Le Havre. Its instead what I would consider a very solid introductory worker placement game.

Tuscany added more, however, I felt there were too many things thrown in. In particular, the area control aspect and game-altering buildings. And a lot of expansions that just seemed to be 'expanding for the sake of expansion' rather than refinements to the original formula. 

Edit: This feels like a very dumb downed, random version of Vinhos, which I'd far rather play.

Instant hit!  This game was very easy to learn and immediately teach.  The directions are well written and the "beginner boards" are very helpful in speeding up the learning process. I love wine so the theme resonates with me.  It's also a nice change of pace to have "race to the finish" scoring rather than tallying up crazy victory points along the way and spending an extra 15 minutes to settle up end game scoring.

I LOVE the way that seasons work in Viticulture. Planning your strategy for different time phases and then working through them is a great mechanic and is incredibly thematic for the wine growing concept of Viticulture. My biggest complaint about this game is that I managed to win twice without ever fully producing a bottle of wine, which is the core concept of the game.

Score is still in flux. I had a great 5-player game, a horrible 2-player one, and a overly long and drawn-out 5-player one. I'll play once more and then decide if it's a keeper or not.

Update: Much better with the Grande variant in a 2 person game. I'll avoid 5-player games like the plague though since they're way too long for what it is.

With the revised (2nd ed?) rules, particularly the "grande worker", this is a comparatively friendly worker placement game. The grande worker can be placed on any action area, even those that are otherwise completely full. As demand for certain action areas is heavily driven by game phase (early vs late), that option does a lot to mitigate the effects of being late in the turn order.

The downside, though, is also those revised rules. There have been so many minor tweaks provided intermittently since release that it's not clear what the current *intended* rules are. This is not terrible (just go with the ones you like), but it's certainly a knock on an otherwise excellent game.

It doesn't scale well at all. Even numbers of players offer too few actions. Summer and winter cards are poorly balanced. Some are just too good, others are just terrible. This causes huge swings independent of competent play. 

It's possible that various tweaks may help, but I'm not interested in beta testing someone else's game.

[i]Viticulture[/i] feels different than most other worker placement games in that placement of workers is split between two seasons and because your strategy must be quickly adapted to integrate randomly drawn yellow/blue cards.  The game is heavily tactical, which I love.

There are many paths to victory, with the path you choose dictated by the cards you receive early as well as by the play of your opponents.  It is crucial to be flexible and have multiple placement options and orders prepared in anticipation of your opponents' placements.

The most important skills for winning the game are:

(1) Wake-up track selection: Being able to correctly weigh the value of turn order versus additional perks is huge.  Sometimes your desired placements are going to be different than your opponents and you will want to select a later position with a huge perk (1 VP or an extra worker).  At other times, it will be critical for you to go first to get what you need while blocking your opponents.

(2) Placement order: This ties in with your selection on the wake-up track.  You have to read where your opponents are planning to play and get there first.  Sometimes my most important placement involves playing two yellow cards, yet I will save that placement for last if I am confident that no one else is interested in that space.

(3) End-game timing: If I am at 17 points, whether I make a mad dash to the finish (by snagging a point at a time selecting 1 VP on the turn track, selling grapes, giving tours, etc.) or attempt to build up to fulfill a contract will depend on my opponents' relative standing and whether they are in a position to reach 20 points this round.

I typically do not enjoy worker placement games.  This one seems different in that it is a game of efficiency.  Wasted actions will cause you to lose the game.  There are no frilly end-game bonuses for extra coins, you can block and be blocked, and the game can end suddenly if you are not thinking ahead.

I only have a couple of gripes about the game:

(1) A few of the yellow/blue cards are overpowered.  Some cards offer 2-4 VP for simple things like removing a single wine token.  With slightly better cards and no other changes, I might rate [i]Viticulture[/i] a 10.

(2) It is fairly easy to predict when a game is entering its final year.  Sometimes (in a 3-player game, for instance) all players will want to fill contracts.  However, only the first two players will be able to, blue cards aside.  If you happen to be third to select on the turn order track and the other players select the top two slots, you are stuck.  Perhaps the inclusion of the Grande worker rectifies this problem (though I am afraid it will take away some other things I enjoy about the game).  We will have to play a game with that variant.

(3) The residual payment track is fairly useless.  By the time you have completed enough wine orders to start getting meaningful payments, you no longer need money.

**********

I am very close to giving this game a 10, because my complaints are less valid than I had originally thought.

(1) A lot of the 2-4 VP cards (in particular, the 4 VP) require multiple turns of planning to implement and enacting them makes it harder to score on orders.

(2) Not being able to fill orders in the last year is not that big of a deal.  If you foresee that as a potential problem, make sure you draw plenty of blue cards (hoping to get a fill order card), get the building that gives you extra cards, and/or pursue other avenues of scoring.  There are many paths to victory; make use of them.

(3) I still think the residual payment track is useless!

A well produced mid-weight euro surrounding the wine business. I've played it twice now and it's definitely a competitive worker placement. 

My major qualm is that some of the cards are much more powerful than others and although you can sell grapes or wines there really only seems to be one path to victory. This creates quite a bottle-neck as far as actions go so being setup both in turn-order and ability to sell wine on the last turn may often influence the outcome. Of course those plans may still be dashed if you need to perform two or more actions and get blocked out of one. That being said I do think there's more to explore as far as trying to specialize your product to really maximize your actions.

There's a rule fix/recommendation that players can produce multiple types of wine during the mashing action. I highly recommend this to make the game less restrictive especially since many orders require multiple types of wine.

Heavily blended with Tuscany with my first and only play - so it's hard for me to rank just the base game.  Decent worker placement with a unique theme, even if it's not one that speaks to me.  I think I might enjoy it more with a more careful approach to introducing the expansions (And a more cultivated roster of visitors).

Update: Played this with just the base game, and it's much easier to teach and rapidly grok.  I still don't have the pacing of this game down, but it's conceptually interesting.  Tuscany certainly overhauled the game a LOT (and I'm aware I haven't played with a lot of the Tuscany modules, though I think those are mostly the modules that didn't make it into Essential Edition.)

I played the original base game. Nice theme with the wine making and great components, but very standard worker placement. The base game feels very random because of the heavy emphasis on random card draw and unbalanced. Solo game is excellent. I hardly ever play games solo, but this one was really fun and challenging. You pretty much need Tuscany in my opinion to fix the problems with the base game

The cards are very important in this game, enough so that it feels like a card game first and worker placement game second to me. The action spaces are limited and compeition for them is fierce, especially at even player counts.

Great worker placement game. Powerful visitor cards augment your strategy, but you have to be flexible due to tight scaling of action spots per player count.

The only thing that keeps this game from a 10 rating is the grape/wine spots are too close together for the size of the glass beads. This can lead to some confusion over what value grapes/wine you have. Also, the end game can happen suddenly if you're not watching out for it.

I feel like I would have liked it better if you got two cards and had to choose one at the start.  Maybe even everytime you picked the "draw a card" action.  As it was I think the cards determined how my game played out far more than any decision I made. In a game where the paths to victory are very similar, some more choices would do well.  

I thought the seasonal idea was interesting, but occasionally one person would only be placing workers in one season, meaning they would sit out for a large chunk of time.
The Fresco-style starting player mechanic was well done.

The art and components are fantastic.  The copy I played on got the metal coins for their kickstarter - amazing quality.

I like worker placement games but this one felt like we were all forced to optimize the same strategy, rather than forge unique ones.  Two years before our game ended, I knew what I was going to do for the rest of the game.   Two full turns is a long time for no real decisions.  

Looking back, most of these comments are pretty critical, but I didn't have a bad time playing.  If my family had this game growing up, I would have loved it and played it all the time.  But today I have access to many other games that do what Viticulture does in a way I enjoy more.

Most worker placement games are too dry for my taste.  I gave this one a shot because I like to try something at least once before I pass judgement.  At least Once.

I found the game to be quite enjoyable.  There are multiple paths to victory points here and the points are hard to come by.  I never had the feeling that anybody was out of the game at any time or that I was shut out because I didn't lock into the game's 'engine' early.  The components are nice and the the game play fits the theme well.  

That is, except for the visitors.  These are some powerful visitors.  The visitors add more than a touch of chaos to the game and were the main detraction for me.  Look, I like a game with chaos, but the magnitude of sway introduced by the visitors seemed to not fit the tight strategy element involved with placing workers and blocking others from making certain moves.  On several occasions I made a strategic move to block a player from, say, fulfilling an order, only to have them play a visitor card that did the same thing.  Wouldn't mind the visitors if they were less powerful but equally varied.

In any case, I would play it again and can recommend this for any WP enthusiast.

Ok, worker placement game.  I like the mechanic of multiple players being able to choose the same action, but the first one gets a benefit.

As others have said, some cards are much, much better than others.  This means that luck on card draws has a large impact on determining the victor (compared to other worker placement games).  Of course, whether or not that is a good thing is a matter of personal preference.

Ultimately, though, this game broke down on turn order.  After the first two turns, with only minor variations, players all chose to go first -- because it is so important (at least, relative to the benefits you get for going later).  The games I played were 6-player.  It's possible it works better at different player numbers.

Where Viticulture deals mainly with the growing and production side of wine, Vinhos deals more with exporting and wine taste testing. Don't know which I like better.

A pretty run-of-the-mill worker placement game. Started to feel pretty samey after only 2 or 3 plays. Luckily the Tuscany expansion came out and blew the doors wide open, but the base game in itself is essentially an efficiency race where everyone is trying to do the same thing faster than everyone else. It's good for what it is, but Tuscany elevates it to greatness.

主題:1
以經營葡萄酒莊為主題的遊戲!能有趣的激發人們對葡萄酒莊園經營生態的興趣，是個主題與遊戲能完美結合的遊戲，讓人滿足經營莊園的小小渴望!

美術:1
美術，大概是很多人被這個遊戲令人吸引的地方，不光是卡片上的人物，連圖板上的托斯卡尼風光，都讓人可以細細品嘗，另外遊戲配件上，各個擬真的實體米寶，葡萄指示物，都令人愛不釋手，邊玩遊戲邊把玩遊戲配件。美術滿分。

規則:1
基本上很好上手，我推坑的咖一教就會。這個遊戲體現了中國古老諺語的精神「一年之計在於春」，每回遊戲分四個階段，春夏秋冬四季，春天決定本年度誰家的工人起床的早，在下個階段能先去卡位搶工作。夏天，工人開始辛勤卡位搶工作，位置有限先搶有優惠，跟百貨公司周年慶一樣先搶先贏。秋天，短暫的休息，許多重要人物會趁著這個季節到葡萄園參觀停留，如何留下好用的幫手來幫助莊園的經營。冬天則是收穫的季節，想要怎麼收成就要怎麼栽，這遊戲能將四季的動作安排合情合理，配合美術真讓人有種經營莊園的感覺。

設置:1
四種卡牌、四包個人米寶組，個人圖板，不用3分鐘馬上開局。

路線:0.5 
遊戲本質是工人放置卡行動格的遊戲，簡單說就是把農家樂中的農莊經營變成葡萄莊園經營，用工人取代農人，用訪客卡取代職業卡，有點簡單版農家樂的味道，但遊戲玩法及算分上就沒有農家樂變化大，甚至有點乾，遊戲主要樂趣還是在卡人位置上及葡萄酒釀成過程中的樂趣。

互動:0.6
遊戲互動上還是著重在卡位，這類型的遊戲很多，不過位置有限，能卡到位就能產生一定的互動，例如將別人想要的訂單位置搶走，但遊戲互動僅止於此，主要還是玩家個人經營策略的抉擇。另外搶春季起床的機制，其實玩到最後，起始玩家都只會想踩第一個起床，變化上少了點刺激。

個人:0.8
自己覺得美術很棒，勝過它的遊戲機制!是個很棒的主題遊戲!

朋友:0.8
朋友反應都不錯，連不喜歡策略遊戲的朋友都能一下融入遊戲機制中!

想玩:0.7 
好不錯，喜歡介紹給新手完的策略遊戲。但跟老手會想玩別的!

收藏:1
美術精美，好推坑，好上手，是個很棒的輕中度策略經營遊戲，適合進入農家樂前的練習遊戲，值得收藏。

總分:8.4
講評:個人覺得玩的過程，路線選擇不多，在搶訂單的過程，其實會覺得葡萄酒有點難釀，因為遊戲結束時，真正完成的訂單不多，讓人覺得成就感不高，尤其玩到現在根本就沒人會想釀出氣泡酒，完成氣泡酒的訂單。遊戲前段會覺得分數一直衝不上去，但遊戲後段分數一下就爆衝上去，遊戲忽然結束，又讓人覺得結束的莫名其妙，尤其是針對落後的玩家而言。

A lot of fun, and the mechanic of only having certain actions available during certain phases of the game helps differentiate it from other worker placements in my collection.  I find myself always wanting to play it, although it's not the most popular game with everyone in my group.  I also find myself always wanting a glass of wine while playing, and I'm more of a beer guy myself.

I also own the Tuscany expansion, with its sweet sweet metal coins.  The extra modules it adds to the game will make it so you never go back to the base game again.

  Fairly good gameplay, however there is little interplayer interaction.  This does not correspond well to the real-world wine industry strategy: winemakers can buy white wine to add to their red to make a blush, which can't be done in the game.  Winemakers can also barter red grapes or wine for white in the real world, but there is no such feature in the game.  Some winemakers can even barter labor for grapes or wine.
  In addition several major viticultural or winemaking activities are not seasonally accurate:
grapes are planted in the spring, harvested and crushed in the fall.  Crushing grapes and making wine costs money (even in the 1800's when there were no lab tests or sulfur additives there were still costs to buy barrels and bottles), which is not reflected in the game.  Getting vines costs money, but the game doesn't match.
  Also several real world features are missing:
winemakers can spend money to hire more labor -- not possible in the game (except by a few special cards)
grape production and quality can vary substantially from season to season -- there could be a die roll which determines whether the red production (e.g. value) is the number on the card or +1 or -1, and the same for white. ex. a harvest might be +1 for red and -1 for white, or +0 for both red and white.

Despite my love of worker placement game, sadly I am not a fan of this one.

The game runs smoothly and is sort of competitive as advertised, but there just aren't enough paths to achieve victory. The dynamics of all games are the same - you started very poorly, then you have too much money with nowhere to go by the end of game. With limited spaces, you basically know how many desirable actions you could make once you know the turn order by spring. 

The cards also add a lot of uncertainty and unfairness to the game.

I could see this being a much better game if it's to be reworked, but right now I would give it a pass.

Nicely-realized worker placement game, perhaps a wee bit on the heavier end of the spectrum.  One significant concern is the likelihood of drawing contracts that are impossible to fulfill in the early going while luckier players get off to accelerated starts.

Suffers from the luck of the cards. Also from the bizarre limit on the number of players who can, for instance, plant vines. Why, I have to wonder, might your workers be unable to plant vines in your fields just because some other vineyards are planting vines in their fields? The same thing goes for harvesting and bottling.

I got it with Tuscany and I don't see much of a reason to start playing Viticulture without some of its modules, like the expanded board.

Despite having a lot going on, Viticulture feels like a peaceful, relaxing game where you convert resources into other resources, little by little gaining more money, cards and victory points.

I like that the game does not end on a fixed amount of turns, but rather when a player reaches or passes a set victory points marker.  I know that's a bit annoying in pure card games, but in here, it makes it feel open-ended and sandbox-like, and it just plays wonderfully.

Can't wait to play it more often!

Viticulture feels like a long game, but that matches its theme well. Wine-making from field to bottle is a long-term commitment and takes years before seeing decent results.

There is one goofy thing about the mechanics though. You start each year with a bunch of workers, but once placed each worker is tied up doing a task for the rest of the  year. Does it really take a full year to plant a field, buy new vines, or give a vineyard tour? It would make more sense for players to start with one worker, but be able to retrieve him each season for placement in the next season.

Something was a bit off about this one even though I enjoyed my play.  I think the cards were a bit off and essentially guaranteed a victory to the person that had the card that worked for his strategy.  

I believe the cards were even changed after the fact, AND we used the corrected cards, but it was tough when the card is in your hand, but you have to read it off of a print-out.

Was taught this by the designer and I liked the game, but the theme didn't pull me in at all.

I'd play this again though and am sure it'll do well within a large portion of our Euro-centric group.

RATING: 4.5
Was there supposed to be more of an arc? It was over so quickly. Eking out ~7 points over the first 6 rounds, then 15 in the next two? Maybe it's too open with 3, despite that being the most recommended number. With the grande worker being anywhere-placeable and chance cards that are a bit too powerful (to be almost engine-obviating), it's a defanged, watered-down worker placement title. Great production values though.
---
second play, downgrading a point. This mixture of outsize chance and standard-length euro sits poorly with me. Fully half my points (11 or 12) came from a barrage of visitor cards: Swindler (3), Handyman (3 or 4), Bottler (3), Advanced something or other (2) -- and before you blame my opponents for the card's deficiencies, I should add that I obliterated the competition, never fulfilled a wine order, and finished in 6 rounds. An undeserved win is worse than a loss for me. I won by drawing the right cards, full stop. A nasty conclusion to arrive at after 1.5 hours of gaming.

The components are very nice, with many different wooden pieces, thick cardboard, nice design with double sided board for learning, etc. The rules are easy and even if it's a worker placement eurom they fall into the theme; while I was playing, I did see myself making wine, but I have to admit that there are a few concesions to the abstraction of the mechanisms.

Those said mechanisms are nothing new, it tales Fresco's wake up chart and divides the woker placement in 2 phases: the workers you place in summer won't be avilable in winter. Everything fits together quite well and the gameplay it creates is very fluid. There are no evident paths to victory: even if there's mainly one thing you need to do to score points, you can get to in in a variety of ways. The game seems balanced, but I still think it should have been worked a bit more to include other options and and rework the cards that give points in order to really offer more diverse strategies.

The time between turns doesn't feel long because the gameplay is fast, but you cannot use this time to think, because the decissions are not difficult. Because of that, I think 5-6 players games won't work well.

The interaction is light: you just compete for worker placement slots and each player has an uberwoker than can be placed in closed spots. Even though, the competitions of spots in the last turns is almost cutthroat. The game will be much more cutthroat with an even number of players (more workers for the same number of spaces).

IMHO, visitors cards are way too powerful. They usually do twice as much as a board action, and sometimes even more. And what's more important, some of them give points! They create a very strong luck element, but then, everybody has their opinion on how much luck they want into their games.


It is gentle worker placement euro with an important luck factor, produces very good sensations.

First impression (5/6 players) : Firstly I must admit that I was slightly amused how almost literally every component on the game has "sponsored by " written on it. Maybe this will bring more money on kickstarter / etc but it really looks kind of silly. 

The game itself was pretty decent. My biggest complain about it would be that randomness in visitor cards and vine cards can make huge differences in games. Some card(combo)s just work so much better in early game that they singlehandedly can decide things. Wasn't that bad in our game but looked like it really could be a factor.

I kind of seem to have a love-or-hate relationship with workerplacement games. I don't really care for most of them, but in a few cases there is something intereting about them, which makes me really like the game. 
Viticulture is for sure on the love-side of the spectrum. 

I really enjoy the summer/winter aspect of the workerplacement and also the Grande worker is a great little twist. There is some luck of the draw in regards to basically all types of cards, but it so far never felt like it really decides the game, but rather makes you maybe change plans to a certain degree, which is something I tend to like when you have to adapt to the state of the game and it's not planning from A to Z without any interference. 

What makes the game an even better experience is the production quality of the game. Especially all the little buildings and the lovely artwork (and I just love the glass tokens) just add to the game. 

And from what I've seen so far from the Tuscany expansion it makes the game even better and more variable, so I'm looking forward to more plays.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Quick update: I did have a chance to play the Essentials edition with Visitors of the Moor and it definitely made the game better and a bit deeper. I've bumper my rating back to an 8; while I won't buy it I'd happily play when given the chance.

I enjoyed my one play, but looking back at the new worker placement games I played Viticulture didn't do anything to stand out from the crowd. In stark contrast, after one play of Snowdonia I went out and bought a copy. There is a lot to keep track of in Tuscany, but it feels more fiddly than deep.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A worker placement game that also is a race to [i]x[/i] number of victory points, awesome because you really have no time to waste.
- Theme, I love wine and instantly felt immersed in the theme of this game.
- Played really well with 2, the game still felt tight and spaces were hotly contested.
- Optimization, I love building and optimizing an engine to generate a commodity which is then converted into money or points.
- I appreciate any wp game that allows you to select a space someone else already chose (in this game you have one "large" worker that can share a space with another worker).[/i]

This is one of the best expansions for a board game. Since it has tiers, you are able to progressively get more and more involved, so the game has great replay ability. It is not a game you will get board of quickly.

Excellent game of making and running your own wine vineyard. 
This game is one of our favorite games and it is so easy and somewhat relaxing to play.
It's light enough to appeal to new gamers and yet it still is a strategic medium weight game.
The Tuscany expansion is also highly recommended in that it adds multiple modules that you can incorporate into your games gradually.
We play where when one player wins a game they choose the next module to add to the next game.

The game plays over 4 seasons but the spring and fall seasons are very simple and only take a few seconds to run through.
In the spring players choose their position on the wake-up track and take the corresponding benefit.
In the summer, players place their workers to perform building, money collecting, planting grape type jobs on the board.
In fall, players choose either a summer card or winter card.
In winter, players place any remaining workers out onto the board to perform harvesting, wine making or worker hiring type jobs.

The structures you can choose to build are pretty cool and make every game play unique. 
That's because you won't always build the same thing from game to game.
The cards are also very lucrative and give you fun boons that give you a quick edge up on your opponents.

Solid worker placement, easy to play but still enough depth and strategy. Card draws and available spaces in first year(s) really determine your plan. The Automa expansion in Tuscany really makes it fun and playable solo within 30 minutes. Very tight. The new Tuscany board is really adding a new dimension.

A really nice worker placement Euro. I like how your bigmanboss can jump in on anything so you never feel like you're completely locked out or stuffed up by turn order when it's critical. I also liked how the first in each area gets a bonus, where for card play it's to play a second card, requiring planning to allow yourself to take full advantage of such bonuses as often as possible. There are hard choices about what type of buildings to invest in and when (ie what's your VP earning strategy), and the competition to acquire money/cards to do so. It's got the standard tropes of getting your new workers asap to ramp up your engine, but it does lots of other nice things so I can forgive it that piece of derivativeness. As such, I'd happily play it again in future.

RATING: 7
"Solid worker placement with a nice theme, which requires a lot of deep planning. It's a race, which makes learning games even longer, so a round-based introductory variant would be helpful. The new board in Tuscany adds complexity that I don't enjoy, but some parts of the expansion are big improvements."

What I like:
- Beautiful components supporting a good theme
- The tension of splitting your workers between seasons is great
- You can win even if you don't make a drop of wine

What I don't like:
- My 2p learning game with Tuscany took almost 3 hours
- My 2p game with a new player (who is not fast) took 4 hours
- Making wine is a bit more complex than I prefer
- Turns out I'm no longer a fan of worker placement, where you can get completely blocked out of spaces

Hands down my favourite worker placement game. The engine building is wonderfully layered between the decisions over what to plant, what buildings to invest in, which visitors to play and when. I bought it mostly to play with my wife who is a lover of wine but the strength of the gameplay means I want to share it with whoever I can. It's not very forgiving of new players (make sure to tell them it's a race to 20 points or they will be left in the dust), especially now that I don't want to play it without the expansion, but it is truly a brilliant design.

Very solid worker placement game. I always include the new board, the Mama and Papas, and a few other little modules from Tuscany when I play. I like the theme and I think the actions do a good job actually capturing the feel of the theme.

This game have interest mechanic and good theme. I like some gamestyle such as, cut a grape to wine and player must plan to make wine with perfect year by mission. But all card is more important than gameplay if player has a good card it easy to win and take too much point . Some player plant and harvest lowest than other but have a highest point by good card.

RATING: 6
This is a game where money should be a bottleneck, but it isn't. Half of the players had to make decisions on what they could afford for the first maybe two-three rounds. After that we were just stackpiling the cash and almost broke the bank at the end of the game. 

The limited amount of worker places compared to the abundance of workers are also poorly balanced and adds to the problem with too much money, since the only place you can put all spare workers is to get money. 

It's a really good looking game with promising, even if simple, game mechanics but the designers haven't really made it work. 

---------

2016-06 Tried it again, three years later. This time Essential version with Mamas & Papas. the major problem we saw with the game three years ago are gone, but now I'm not sure if the changes in the rules fixed it or if we did something wrong the first time. Anyway, I have set my rating for the essential version accordingly.

update: See Tuscany expansion. with this expansion and the 2nd edt. rules I revised my rate up!

-----

one 2 player game: it was fun but unbalanced.
one 4 player game: I find it fun, but still quite unbalanced, specially by the cards, clearly there are some a lot better than others. I tend to agree with Tom Vasel appreciation: one a player takes some lead, it is quite difficult to catch him, and the winner is found some time before the game actually ends and second: we end the game with a lot of money, for what? there should be a way of scoring with money... yes we are making wine, but the objective of a winemaker is too sell, to be profitable, so it would be not a bad idea to consider some rules updating, taking these and other aspects in consideration. 
Overall it has good ideas in general, I like the theme a lot, and I will try it with 3 and 5 players, maybe with an odd number the game gains more balance.

RATING: 4
Beautiful artwork, but variance in cards was way too much for me. Some of them were insanely powerful and others useless. Also, if you draw only red or only white grape cards, there's not much you can do in the game, because it's very hard to find orders which you could fulfill. I also didn't like the turn order mechanic very much, because early seats are so much better than later seats, especially later on in the game.

Great production values, but the game itself was not for me. There are many better worker placement games around.

Update:

Ok, played this one with two players. Gameplay is solid, fast, lots of stuff to do. However, one big downside: all hinges on the card draw. If you do not draw good cards (though you draw a lot of them), you are screwed. In a second edition, I would rework the cards and streamline them much more to avoid the uneven distribution of luck which I felt, was not for the better of the game. All in all, nice ideas, excellent production, a light game with luck. Not bad, but also a bit slow (so 2 hours seemed to be realistic).

Excellent production values, a reliable KS campaign with lots of updates. Top notch service from Jamey. 
I have not yet played the game, but the rules booklet is pretty confusing. You need the FAQ I guess. I think a gameturn overview wouldn't have hurt and the cards seem to be the key to the game. Let's see...

RATING: 4
I am torn here. The game mechanically is really well done and probably deserves an 8.5. However I've got to take a point off for the cards in the game. I don't think the yellow and blue cards are balanced at all. Some of the cards grant so much more victory point wise and that can very much determine the winner. 01/02/16

Update: a 5 take or leave now.

This is a worker placement game about operating a winery.  There are two worker placement phases--spring and autumn, and workers used in spring cannot be used in autumn, and vice versa.  Furthermore, actions typically had three worker spots, and the first player to use an place in an action got an extra benefit.  There were a number of steps that it took to create a finished product, so the opportunity for planning was large.  I really enjoyed that part of the game, but I have concerns that the cards that players can draw to get bonuses might be too strong or too swingy.

The second best Kickstarter so far (after City of Iron). I can imagine why people would advise you to play this with 3 or 5, near the end, when people usually have lots of workers, it can be very crowdy on the board and you really want to be first or second. My advice is: immediately add the 'Viticulture: Arboriculture Expansion', as you create extra spaces on your own board where you can put your workers in a usefull way.

I really like this kind of games, as everything is tight and there is always more stuff you wanna do, but just can't. So making good choices and having a good timing is crucial!

Viticulture is an okay game, but it has a lot of flaws including luck of the draw and unintuitive aging and grape math that's hard to teach.

Unlike other worker placement games, there are places that are just clearly the best places. The grapes, that allow players to chose the turn order decide the last turns of the game. These should be places that can be selected. 

I'd consider a variant where you can trade in two workers for another Big Worker.

It doesn't bring much new to the hobby, and the cards - necessary to bring variation into the game - also introduce swingy randomness and feel-bad-moments, even when it's just drawing all red grape cards and white wine orders. Still, a pleasant worker placement game.

Worker placement game with a vintner theme apparently inspired by Agricola, Stone Age and Fresco. Desire to play dropped dramatically (and I will refuse to buy) after reading designer's comparison with other worker placement games under "More Info" section of BGG entry. Turned off by his over-inflated sense of self and arrogant analysis of what makes a game good (ie, why his is a better game). I think about where my money goes, and it is not going here. Ego inflation, successful; promotional attempt, failed.

If Belfort hadn't already killed Agricola all the way, Viticulture comes along with a pillow to smother it to death. This is so much more enjoyable for me than agricola because the game system isn't forcing everyone to do the same exact thing! Making wine doesn't have to be the crux of your strategy. Especially playing with the 2nd edition changes, I think this game is a perfect 10.

Outstanding worker placement game!  The theme of managing your vineyard comes through loud and clear.  The 4 step progession wine economy (plant vines, harvest fields, crush grapes to make wine, fill orders) is thematic and satisfying.  The visitor cards (which give special powers) are well done.

You need to keep an eye on the end-game because if you're a move late in pushing through your last wine orders, you will loose the game.

Great game.  Highly Recommended.

Mechanically, if Pillars of the Earth and Fresco had a baby it would be this game.  Takes a lot from these two game and mixes it together to make an enjoyable refreshing, intuitive game about the wine making business.

Works well with two too.

I have played this quite a few times now (my wife kickstarted the Tuscany expansion, and is keen to get a few groups of ours into it so that we can start adding the expansion stuff, although we still haven't done that over a year on, despite knowing the game relatively well) - several 2p games, but also at least one each at 3p, 5p and 6p. I enjoy the game, it's quite an interesting take on an economic worker-placement game, and I have enjoyed all of my plays (2p was probably my least-favourite count because no-one can get the bonuses for each action), but have not been hugely impressed with it either. To a large extent it feels a bit too random, drawing the right cards at the right times (primarily visitors, but also wine orders and to a lesser extent vines) gives you a huge advantage over a player who draws them at the wrong time. I am hopeful that some elements of the expansion might fix this. Despite this flaw I find it a game I'm almost always happy to play - yet I can't see me ever requesting it either. 

I'm surprised this has made the top 100 (although I'm sure the expansion has a lot to do with it, we really must try that at some point) - personally I find it much inferior to Stonemaier's subsequent release, Euphoria.

I like the core mechanic(s) of planting, harvesting, crushing to sell wine orders.  What is keeping the rating down for me at the moment are the visitor cards.  Some seem very powerful while others seem very weak and it is the luck of the draw that decides which player benefits.  Perhaps with more knowledge of the cards, this is mitigated somewhat, but don't see how.

While the action spaces scale well with the number of players (6 total in each season for 2 players / 12 in each season for 3,4 players / 18 in each season for 5,6 or 3/player in each season) the turn order track does not.  It gets congested at the higher player counts leaving more and more players with less choice.  Would have been nice if the wake-up chart scaled in some way as well.

the theme integration is good, but the game is not very deep, and there are a few too many rules and a little too much luck.  I'd recommend playing it if you like the wine-making theme and want a light euro.  Nothing really wrong, just nothing really right.

Very thematic worker placement - well-implemented. Reminds me a lot of Fresco with wake-up time and resource conversion.  Randomness of card draws can be a bit annoying.  I think the purple cards would be better done as a set of open-faced ones players are racing to fulfill. Yellow and blue cards are fun, but they are definitely not balanced - some are a lot better than others, and these would be better implemented as face-up drafts like portrait cards in Fresco. And the wake-up time rewards seem a bit out of whack and not as well ordered as Fresco. All in all a great game but not as elegant as it could have been.

RATING: 3
This is the game that convinced me that a huge economic machine building game should never come down to sheer luck. The card draws in this game will make or break everything else you do, and some cards are vastly overpowered compared to others.  Most importantly, the card draws aren't always the type you can plan around OR respond to quickly, which means the game comes down to luck. If you get the grapes that match your sales cards you are going to do well. If you can't get matching grapes and sales cards, all of your building will come to naught, and there is nothing you can do. (And a game spent madly trying to draw cards to get what you need to no avail is not much fun.)

I love the building up of the vineyard. I love growing and harvesting the grapes. But I really wish they had created a permanent sales board with all the types of wine you could sell to the side. Then you could plan for your sales, and it really would be an excellent strategy game.

Component-wise the quality is high - my only issue is with the buildings which seemed fairly pointless - counters could have explained their function better, some are indistinguishable from each other, and there's no specific place for them to go. That's a nitpick though. It's a fine game, well themed and satisfying to play. The expansion looks awesome - this one has gone on the wishlist!

UpDate - Owned! As part of the Collector's Edition. One of the very best Worker Placement games - clearly a labour of love from the designer.

Instant top 5 after one play even with only two players. Blocked twice in a roll once from a build structure and then make wine. Sure would have been nice to have that second action spot open and my poor grande worker got used in the summer. Came down to the wire with girlfriend winning 25-24 by playing a winter visitor that scored 2 victory points and leapfrogged her over me. Arrgh! Lol

Can't wait to try this with 4! Need to play this one many times. Maybe I can get a Stegmaier night going with the neighbors when Between two Cities shows up!

RATING: 7
I was excited to finally learn this and I enjoyed it.  There are lots of familiar elements from other games, but there seems to be a couple of things missing.  Money seems tight early, but then you have piles of it later, but nothing to do with it - and it isn't worth anything!  It plays pretty tight, which I don't mind, but it's apparently VERY tight without the grande worker.  All in all, a nice wine game and I enjoyed the lightness of it compared to something like Vinhos.

An additional play has simply reassured me that selling my Kickstarter copy was a wise move.  It's an ok game, but you can get shafted with a bad card draw out of the gate and there is very little you can do about it.  I normally don't mind some randomness in games, but I have a feeling that people who are particularly touchy about it will have a big problem.  Another thing that annoys me is all of the rule changes and variants that have come out after the game has been published.  I know that it's an attempt to make the game better - it just bugs me.

Decent game, quite a bit of luck which makes it good for social/family play.  Definitely not worth $60 though.  I'd buy it for $30.  The custom bits look nice but don't serve a useful purpose, they actually make the game harder to play since it isn't clear which building each of the pieces is supposed to represent.

This is a great semi-light euro with fantastic theme. You need to manage your workers between Summer and Winter action spaces. Cards make the game very interesting as a lot of the cards are powerful, but with the expansion, cards are not over powered. Second edition rules fixes the confusion with "Crushing Grapes" action, and the addition of Grande Worker makes the game a lot less crowded as this special worker allows you to take the action even if there is no available spaces for the action. Overall I really enjoy this game and I would love to play more!

Have only played with the Arboriculture expansion. Good card draws definitely help. A decent bottle of wine doesn't hurt either (but isn't that true of all games?), especially if it's Tuscan wine to bring the theme to life. The 2-player game seemed much tighter than multi-player games. Everyone that I've played with (as well as a lot of onlookers) have loved the unique wooden bits. Definitely sets the bar for Kickstarter production quality.

Super solid worker placement game. I like that there are many decisions to make that have a big impact on the game. We often spend a good 15-20 minutes after each play just discussing things we wish we had done differently and what worked really well. I think that is always a sign of a good game. I like that each year plays quite quickly, but you need to do some planning ahead- do you want to use those workers now or save them for the winter? If you save them, will someone take the spots you need to where you'll wish you did something in the summer instead? We are currently in the process of unlocking the Tuscany expansions legacy style!

Played a play test copy for the new kickstarter coming up.  The game is fun and I think our length of game was unusual as it was new for several of the players.  The game offers many, many paths to victory.  It would take a lot of play to explore them all.  It is however a multiplayer solitaire.  This game needs some interaction above just the worker placement because even in a 6 player game three opportunities per action plus a grande worker allowing me to use an action that is blocked off allows players do pretty much do whatever they want.  I feel there is just not enough tension.  I am defiantly willing to play again and am watching close to see what the final kickstarter version will look like as this could become an excellent game.  Also, with how the new production sounds with specialized workers it will look amazing.

An entry that represents my feeling about all Steigmeir games.  They're the walmart of board games.  Bland.  Unoriginal.  Consumable.  And targeted at the unthinking masses whose baser instincts drive them to accumulate garbage.  All of his games are just implementations of much better designed games with nice bits and a slick kickstarter slapped on.  You don't have to think hard to play them or be particularly smart because they don't offer a difficulty or puzzle that their original counterparts present.  Instead, you can sneer at the people still playing Agricola or Terra Mystica when your 2 hour game wraps up exactly on time, leaving the rest of your evening open to post on Facebook about how awesome Jamie's games are.

A lovely game. I have the 2nd edition, which I'm told improved a few things, and I guess it shows. This is a great little worker placement game that isn't too stressful (you don't have to beg if you don't make your wine) and allows you to create your own little vineyard; a very satisfying feeling. I like the strong sense of theme even though I'm not at all a wine guy. The game seems to scale nicely (I've enjoyed it at 2 and 4) which is a bonus. The only downside is a it's a little fiddly in places (moving those grape/wine bottles around) but that's a very minor quibble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game for 3-6 players, not quite as good for 2 players (unless you cheat and use the 'grande worker' rule for your 2 player games - can find it under their website, 2nd edition proposed rules).  With that little adjustment the 2 player game is quite fun (my wife and I have played a number of 2 player games).

The first thing you'll notice when you open the box is that this was clearly a labor of love - the components, the deep box with lots of room for expansion parts, etc. all ooze planning, thoughtfulness, and a joy for the game.

The learning curve is a little high for it to be a great introductory game - which we hoped it would be with the subject matter.  However, for any one who has played board games this little gem has quite a bit of replay value.  I have seen games where you get lucky and fill wine order after wine order, and wish the game required 50 VP's instead of 20.  And then there are games where you win (or lose) without filling a single order.

All in all, well worth the money.  This was clearly the type of game kickstarter was meant to help get off the ground!

A solid worker placement game. The theme definitely comes through, as you really do feel like the owner of a vineyard and you're working hard to manage what varieties you can grow in your fields, while also making and selling wine. I love that the grapes and wine age, and so there's certainly an art to balancing aging your wine for more value and having it clog your cellar as you need to produce other types of wines. I like the bidding for turn order by waking up at different times, and certainly the two different seasons of using your workers forces you to really work out your plan. I find some challenging decisions in breaking up your plan to do something opportunistic or to thwart an opponent. Rating certainly could move up a bit with more plays.

Love the components. The game has several balancing issues on the cards, mainly because we have no info whatsoever about what's coming next. My guess, and even if the decision taking would take longer, is that we should have like 3 open cards of each kind to choose from. That would for sure increase the challenge for each action. Also, I would like to see some player order change from spring to winter. It seems too crystalized and easy to manage. William Attia does this in a much more clever way in Spyrium.
But I liked the experience of playing Viticulture. I like wine, and I like games and this is a good combination. Thematically the game works.

A very tight worker placement game with a race to the Finnish feel. Tuscany expansion really elevates this to its nine rating for me. Base game probably a solid 7. 
Game strategy revolves a lot around card draws so be aware of that going in. At first it feels the only way to score is via fulfilling wine orders. There are a few different ways to score in this however.

Another great worker placement, without it slaming you around.  Everyone gets to grow, just a matter of how quickly / efficiently you do it.

This game accurately reflects the world of wine-making in that it takes forever to get your vines planted, your grapes grown and harvested, your wine made and bottled, and your first wine order filled.  But all good "engine building" games require patience, and this is a very good engine building via worker placement game.  In fact, from both a game play and a physical production point of view, this just might be one of the best games to ever be released by a first-time designer/publisher!  The components are certainly top-drawer, what with all the unique wooden pieces, the glass tokens, and the lovely illustrations.  There are a few little wrinkles in this otherwise fine game, such as the fact that I've won handily in a 4-player game without even focusing on making wine (I only filled 1 wine order, and it was a bit of an after-thought when I was already well in the lead), but the latest official rules set helps to clear up some of them, as do a few simple house rules.  Cheers to Jamey and to Stonemaier Games for a lovely game!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

Very nice engine building game, although I do wonder just how carried the engines tend to be (certainly the order in which you build them will vary). Also you can be significantly set back by poor luck (only white vines and red order). There are ways to respond to that but it does set you back. 

The Tuscany expansion seems to address both of these criticism, so I'm really looking forward to that. Even with these questions I enjoyed the game

As is so typical with a Stonemaier release, Viticulture has too much chrome and not enough game. I just can't trust the company to put out an appropriately finished product, sorry. Note: I did bump the rating a point for the terrific artwork.

Single play, 6 new players. Things took a while to get going, then we rushed to a conclusion in a few rounds. It looks great, but I can't help feeling more effort was spent on design than on tuning gameplay - spring & winter cards seemed very swingy.

I think this worker placement game suffers too much from everyone wanting to do the same things at the same time. I think it needs more variety in strategy so that the different locations are really pushing you towards different strategies. It's very possible I just don't understand the strategies well enough - I haven't played this game more than a handful of times.

A light and enjoyable worker placement game with a fun theme. Random elements provide some longevity and keep the game tactical (not too strategic for new players). There's something wonky and unbalanced about lots of aspects of the game (order cards, visitor cards, bonus action spaces) but most people I play this game with love it. You can either moan about the unbalanced aspects or just accept them and build your strategy around them (e.g. digging for the better visitor cards, grabbing the powerful bonus actions first) and I prefer the latter.

A lot of fun.  Great gameplay feel.  Just enough spots to consistently get locked out, but enough to always have something you can do.  Two season system was really cool, when do you hold tight, when do you keep playing during summer?  Cards provided just a touch too much randomness for me, but not enough to ruin the experience at all.

Have since setup my copy to be exactly like the essential version (using my Tuscany Expansion stuff).

Played a version using the new setup, the game still feels pretty good. With a slow burn at the start and rapidly ramp up to a close race at the end. 

I guess my main gripe with the game is the random visitor cards that are drawn, I might implement a draw 2 discard 1 or even "gasp" a draft. The visitors are very powerful and I think that they really define the strategy a player employs in their game.

I left out the Mama/Papa and Properties cause I was introducing it to new players. Definitely be using them when I play with my wife next time. The variable setup will definitely more clearly steer players into a end-goal they can pursue.

One of the new players commented that the game feels like Caylus. Oh man this is far more friendlier than Caylus. I do want to try the granddaddy of worker placement though.

The other new player enjoyed the game, but the theme of the game didn't capture him as he expected entering the game.

Viticulture is proving to be a solid design but not that exciting with 2 players.  I'm hoping more players improves the tension.  It pulls elements from many familiar games and blends them well.  I don't feel that there are "many strategies" that others have spoken of.  The theme is fun and the mechanics seem like it would be a great intro Euro game.

I'm on the fence as to whether Tuscany will improve this for me.  I may trade it off before then.

update:  Played with 4 players.  Much better game. The other methods of gaining victory points really showed their usefulness.  I'm keeping it for now for larger game nights.  I think it will be a good one to provide enough strategy for me but easy enough for casual gamers to grab on to.  The theme was a hit.

RATING: 7
Good little resource management game. Takes a little while to get going so you spend most of the game getting nowhere before right at the end everything clicks together and you score points freely. Aging the grapes/wines and trying to judge when to harvest your fields for maximum benefit is a nice little tactical element. Then there are the random visitor cards which can be awesome or useless depending on what and when you draw them, this luck element is a good thing for any groups who have that one player that always wins every game, but if you're looking for a game that doesn't potentially "cheat" a player from victory maybe this isn't the best game for you.

In my opinion the game is not too bad but not brilliant. There are better games that do similar things out there but I didn't mind playing this and would play it again.

A great worker placement game. We don't have a lot of experience with this genre, but we've played it a fair amount and really enjoy it. It's a very different experience with different numbers of players. Had a hard time playing with non-gamers who weren't used to Euro game mechanics. Was able to grab the kickstarter version, but don't find that the few extra additions really add a lot of play value. I would recommend the standard version. Starts slow, but can build to a lot of points quickly once the grapes are on the crush pad. Familiarity with the game is definitely helpful. Need to give it a few playthroughs to really appreciate it. Looking forward to Stonemaier Games next release.

The game is too tight. Turn order is everything and it is hard to get the important actions. The cards are very uneven in effect.

Played using the grande worker and an odd (5) number of players. The game was much better. There was fighting for spaces, but it wasn't too tight. Players even chose turn order based on bonuses they wanted rather than simply claiming the first two spots.

Played again using grande worker, but 6 players. I am not sure why, but this game wasn't as tight as previous games. Maybe we each were doing different things.

I want to like this game more. Maybe I need to play it more, but it is way too expensive at my current interest level.

Best played with the arboriculture expansion - it adds a good amount of depth and smooths out the gameplay a lot, without adding a lot of complexity.  

This is a worker placement game centered around making wine. I enjoy this both for the theme and the fact that it feels different from most worker placement games in that the winner is not always the person that was able to get more workers right away (I have often tried that and I get beat consistently). There a couple of different ways to score points and a bit of randomness with the cards, but the game isn't overly long either.

Great theme and components. The wooden bits and artwork on the board are all top notch. What I was less impressed with were the mechanics. It's not that they were bad -- they weren't. I just didn't see too much going on that I couldn't get out of any number of other worker placement games. The cards added some variety, but also added unpredictability. The different worker stations, while thematically tight, were mechanically run of the mill. I've never been a fan of production games (i.e., first do this, then convert those into that, then do this other thing for points; now repeat). Finally, the pacing of the game was slow. You ramp up your production, but there wasn't enough going on to keep my interested over the course of the 2+ hours. All in all, I was underwhelmed.

RATING: 3
I'm a huge worker-placement game fan, but Viticulture was just too riddled with flaws to be enjoyable. It really felt like it hadn't been playtested. The cards are problematic in several ways. First, they are WILDLY uneven in terms of usefulness and power, and nothing unbalances a game more quickly than this. The order cards should have been divided into large and small orders; some lucky players will start the game with small, achievable orders that, because of the residual income they provide every turn, get their engines humming early. Other players will draw large, end-game orders early and fall hopelessly behind. And the fact that, barring a lucky card draw, only three players (in a five- or six-player game) will be able to fulfill orders and score points in the final round is ridiculous in the extreme. The game also simply felt off - in need of fine-tuning. For example, by the time players have a steady income and purchasing power, it's so late the in the game that the two largest buildings aren't worth constructing.  By the end of the game, four out of every five cards drawn are useless. It feels like getting all dressed up and having nowhere to go. Literally, because toward the end of the game, when players get things clicking (including having more actions to spend), the number of actions that are actually useful dwindles rapidly. The game has a few good ideas, but sadly feels choppy rather than smooth; clunky and uneven rather than well planned and polished. UPDATE: The publisher apparently has fixed the issue I mentioned about players being shut out of critical actions on the final turn with the inclusion of uber meeples that can duplicate an action (as of the game's second edition). This doesn't help the fact that I spent two hours basically playtesting a published game because the publisher was too lazy to develop the game properly in the first place. More and more Kickstarter games have this problem ... they're over-produced (Viticulture's Kickstarter edition was nothing if not gorgeous) and under-developed. Not a great trend if you're going to actually play the game.

The artwork is certainly attractive, and the theme is original and intriguing

Love this game.  Love everything about it.  You get the sensation of building a very nice engine, somewhat similar to Agricola, but not as cutthroat.  People complain about the variable visitor cards but I like the randomness and the decision point to alter your strategy or cut your losses with the card.  Top notch production quality.  One of the few games I'll play solo.

Fantastic game that I've played 8 times with never winning. Great components, plenty of replayability. I have been bitten by the swingy nature of the Visitor cards more times than I can count, but they add some great flavor to the game. The Tuscany expansion is amazing with it; still have to try more than half of the modules though. Great for families and gamers alike.

I love wine, so thematically this grabs me.  It's pretty tight with even players, but we modified a little bit by using a "Grande" worker in even player games to loosen the game up a bit.  This became an official change in August 2013.

Fun to play, and really great components.  I really enjoy playing the game with my wife.

Fun fact: According to the designer, Jamey Stegmaier, the soft "V" in the title was actually designed to replicate the Gateway Arch (inverted) as a tip of the hat to St. Louis, Jamey's home base for the last 14 years.

I own the original Kickstarter edition, which includes some exclusive content: 

-4 Promo Visitor Cards (Summer - Wedding Party, Volunteer Crew; Winter - Guest Speakers, Caravan)
-1 Scorebook
-8 Wine Coasters
-1 Wine Crate Box Sleeve
-1 Custom Art Print
-1 Set of Stickers (which can be used to modify starting values on player boards if desired, ala 7 Wonders)
-Arboriculture Expansion 

Because the Kickstarter edition of Viticulture came with the Arboriculture Expansion and the included Grande Workers, I was equipped to play with the updated second edition rules from day one.

The basic gameplay was great and the production was good, although a number of the custom wooden tokens were too similar to each other. You have a Fresco-style turn order phase, then you do some simple worker placement.

But I had a few issues with the game. During the turn order phase, the decisions are usually really obvious. Take the starting spot if you really need it, otherwise take the extra worker spot. My biggest issue, though, was the cards. You will win or lose based on the cards you draw. To make matters worse, some of the cards are obviously imbalanced (one card gives a player 3 dollars, while another card in the same deck gives a player 2 dollars).
Another issues is player count. This game is not good with two players because of the obvious turn order choices, but also because it then becomes too restrictive to do anything. It seems like it would be best with three.

Sold.

Alright so the buzz has arrived. I got my copy of this from CSI for 40 bucks. Neat game. Kind of a basic worker placement game with an item or two that makes it interesting. I like this one and plan on seeing it played a good bit. 

However it's awful at 2 players. With the game end trigger coming at 20 points there is no reason to ever skip the turn order option of "take 1 VP." I know people will argue with me on this but really I've proven it. Even in my head I can rationalize how other options should be better at certain times but honestly if it's left for you...TAKE it. This means your opponent then must take it on their, leaving you the first player position. All in all the turn order sequence loses so much of it's luster and it's one of the coolest parts of the game.

I have to admit I have a fondness for wine themed games. I like (and own) Vinhos and Vino. So when I saw this game I was intrigued. But then I heard it compared to Ticket to Ride and honestly I'd just prefer something heavier. And the only person I knew who owned it declared it "boring" after reading the rules.

I finally got a chance to play it and I have to say I like it. Overall, I like almost everything about it... As mentioned the theme appeals to me. It's a worker placement game with a turn order mechanism extremely similar to Fresco, where you choose how early in the day you rise; early risers get fewer benefits but get to go earlier in turn order. There are buildings that help you in the game, some help you and some you just flat out need.

You are planting vine cards in your fields, harvesting grapes, crushing them into wines and then fulfilling wine contracts for points and some ongoing income. The game ends at 20 points and scores are capped at 25 with ties being decided by money first, and then wines.

The only potential downside of the game for me are the cards. There are four decks, vines to plant, wine contracts, and summer and winter visitors. I'll skip over a discussion of randomness in the vines and wine contract decks with only a comment that getting the ones you need is helpful.

It's the visitor cards that are really troubling. Visitor cards can be really powerful. And some are definitely more useful than others, and some are more useful if you get them at the appropriate times. So if you happen to draw the right visitor cards, it can really give you a huge boost.

Drawing visitor cards is something you do once per round. Normally it's one per round until you build the appropriate building which lets you draw two. So luck can definitely be a factor here. I'm not sure after a single play how much this is a problem with the game. I can certainly see a potential problem here, but perhaps I'm overreacting.

Played one so far with five and the expansion. Threw a bunch of stuff from the expansion in and the five of us had no problem, including one person new to worker placement games.

 There was a ton to do with all the different cards and the expansion board and though it was a bit slow going since we are new I think everybody had a lot of fun. 

Look forward to my next play-

The 2 player with my wife was engaging, but I think I really like the bonus spaces with 3-4 playing. I am happy I have the game and look forward to more plays...we'll see if it moves up over time.

This game is excellent. It's not perfect, nor is it even balanced sometimes. But it is excellent and it is satisfying. However... if there was one thing i could say almost achieves perfection within the game is the marriage of theme and mechanics. It can be tricky to explain a couple of rules and concepts to players, especially if you are kind of new to the game yourself. Depending on the group you may need to drill a few points home harder that usual.

The result though...

Few economic games have ever given me an itch to play again as soon as possible. Don't get me wrong i love the strategies, the "euro" style, the themes that range from bone dry to sufficiently drenched have given me many wonderful experiences over the last few years. i searched high and low for games that give me "that" feeling, but this game hit the nail on the head.

Production quality is extremely good. 
Game play has decent amount of randomness but gives you plenty of room to mitigate and guide it to your favor.
Some of the card powers, if they come up in the right order for the right person can throw the game out a bit (hence my unbalanced comment in the beginning) but never so much that I'm sour about it. 

So ends my thoughts of the game on its own because i have begun to integrate expansion modules from Tuscany into it and it has changed the experience enough that the two but be laid separate. 
Spoiler alert: get Tuscany.

Worker placement style with special cards.
Originaly worker placement games were made to increase the soeed turn of each player. 
Here, you add special cards that are more powefull than board spots. And, if your cards doesn't strategically match each other, it's not efficient.
What is the point to include random in a worker placement game ? replayability ? Maybe, but as I like luck and replayability in feeler games, I don't like that in 1h30 strategic games.
That's why it's a 6.

This is possibly the quintessential intro game to worker placement.  All of the concepts of what you are doing are very easy to pick up and understand.  The game is very friendly aside from some light space blocking.  Scores are always close no matter how badly you play (which is a negative for experienced gamers), and the pieces and artwork are eye catching and endearing.

I think it makes for a great, family worker-placement.  It's enjoyable to play, just lacking a bit of teeth for me.  Also very little variability.  I felt like I experienced everything in just 2 plays.  Saw every card and tried every strategy.  The gameplay  just felt samey and never grabbed me.

May be one of the most fun "heavy" worker placement games I've tried. I've only played with some of the Tuscany modules though. I really enjoyed the minimap in the bottom corner. 

I'm a huge fan of how this game scales so well to many players. Our game was almost 3 hours long but we had a good amount of explaining to get through. 

This game strikes a good balance between needing to have a plan and adapting to luck of the draw changes as they come up. I also love the Grande worker letting you do at least 1 action FOR SURE, usually in the fall-winter phases 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
May be broken with max amount of players (4). 

Edit: still painstakingly cultivating and aging grapes but on second play, with the expansion, the game is much better. Luck of the draw, however, can kill your game and is a drag. you can keep cycling through cards until you find the ones you need (at the expense of other actions), but if you don't, you're dead in the water. and if you get lucky on your draws, well, then the game is that much easier for you. I don't hate it like I hated the base game, but at 3+ hours for 5 players, I'd sooner play something else.

This is a great entry point for gaming initiates looking to explore worker placement. I don't think there is enough here for anyone with full game shelves. It's far too luck driven I think, because of how much it relies on card draws. There are more than a couple moments each game where you are placing your workers blindly and hoping for the best.

It's gorgeous though and it seems like the Tuscany expansion adds a lot of interesting stuff, so it certainly has merit, even if it's not necessarily for me.

With the Tuscany expansion this game is just fantastic. My wife and I enjoy it immensely. I dont know why we like it so much. I think the Tuscany bits give more opportunity to make up for bad card draws and bad luck. There are more ways to mitigate and makeup for things. In previous plays of Viticulture I felt like it was too easy to be one sided.

In any case the game scales well and is a blast.

I like light-to-medium sized germans. Viticulture is already a bit too much for me. It's not overly complicated and turns have a decent rhytm if you aren't playing against AP-prone people. The game has nice components and the theme is heavily present and nice.
Unfortunately the game drags along for too much time, the engine at the beginning is very very very slow to start and the game becomes too repetitive; cards are too different and starting with a couple of bad draws can seriously screw your game without you having made any serious error (like 3 or 4 purple cards with incredibly costly wines... you'll be able to fulfill them only in the end or you have to waste a lot of time drawing purple cards again).
Not a bad game, some sort of ameritrashgerman but without anything truly original or distinctive. There are better germans around.

I was a backer of the first edition of Viticulture when it was originally on Kickstarter. I loved the idea of a worker placement game with the approachable theme of a vineyard, something I thought would appeal to my wife. However, I didn’t even make it that far, I was so disappointed with all of the changes that Stonemaier games seemed to make after releasing Viticulture to the public. It wasn’t finished. In addition, the game was selling for far more than I bought it for, so away it went.

Then came along the Tuscany Kickstarter and I considered backing that one too, but I avoided it remembering how much I disliked the weird rule changes from the first edition.

So, how did I end up playing this game? Well, Miniature Market was having a sale on Tuscany: Prima Edition and I had just seen Tom and Zee’s review of both Viticutlure and Tuscany, so I decided I’d give it another shot.

I’ve only played the solo variant—Automata—so far, but I really enjoyed it. The grande worker change works far better than I ever thought it would back with the first edition changes. I love the tension of only being able to use some of the actions, yet being able to override that with the grande worker when absolutely necessary. I enjoy planting the grapes in the field, harvesting them, and turning them into while, all the while watching them age between rounds.

There’s a lot of interesting decisions to be made, yet I think the structure is simple enough to be a next-step game, something for people who have played a few gateway games. In addition, the amount of game you get in Tuscany seems crazy to me. I love the idea of having multiple modules for the expansion. That being said, I haven’t played with anything but the Automata variant and the shiny metal coins.

The only weaknesses come from the nature of the game. It’s a simple game with a few choices and there’s some randomness to the cards. Those cards provide you with your grapes, your wine orders, and any visitors that might help you out, so if someone finds a great synergy and you don’t, you’re going to have to work that much harder to get over it. They’re not deal breakers for a game of this weight.

I’m happy I bought both Viticulture and Tuscany, but I’m not sure I would have if Tuscany hadn’t been on sale. On one hand that makes me a little sad, it’s a great game. On the other hand, I’m not sure what this game does that others don’t. Right now I recommend this game if you like games like Stone Age and want variety and something close to the same weight.

RATING: 7
I think this game overall does a good job of matching the mechanics to the theme (though it drives me crazy that the grapes INCREASE in value on the crush pad, when in reality they would just spoil). The biggest flaw is that there are so many steps required to fill wine orders (acquire vines, earn money, build prerequisite structures, plant vines, harvest grapes, make wine) and so few workers to start with, a significant amount of time passes before anyone begins accumulating points. I've found that players start wondering, "Will this game ever end?" because the point track remains static for an hour. It's nice once production finally gets underway, but the slow ramping up process can be frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rulebook absolutely must be read whist looking at the components and the board;
After a turn or two, the board and components are self-explanatory,
and the rulebook can be set aside, which is Nice!

Seemingly overly complex at first glance,
the game is well thought out in its sequencing
and plays very, very well.

The added meeples too are a bit confusing at first,
but become common-sense additions after a play or two.
The family's 'favorite of the month';
I'll need to see if it remains a favorite over time.

{Edit}
My daughters new favorite game, hands down.
I've been trying to figure out how to explain 
why such a complex game plays so easily:
I believe it comes down to how well the mechanics marry to the theme.
There is -so- much going on during a turn,
but each turn follows the theme of a yearly growing season: Inttuitive!

I may need to bump this a point after a few more plays....

What else can one say?
This game -literally- wrote the Book on KS success stories
(Jamey's 'A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide '. which see)
This is, Hands Down: my Eldest Daughter's favorite game.

Verdict: Rousing Success

My wife truly enjoys running her vineyard with worker placement and set collection. We also like the cost/benefit decision of turn order. We have already pre-ordered Tuscany.

It's far from a perfect game in terms of design. There is too much variability in the powerful visitor cards, a bad run of draws can break your strategy mid-game. But the components are very enjoyable and the artwork is pleasant (aside from the sometimes jarring images of Kickstarter backer's faces on the cards). Overall, it's a pleasing game if you don't take your Euro games too seriously.

Outstanding gateway+ worker placement game with a unique theme. Player mats really feel like your own personal vineyard, and shuffling glass beads around from crush pads to the storeroom while maximizing the yield of each field is a brainy pleasure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Worker placement game where the theme actually seems to matter.  You must plant vineyards, harvest grapes, make wine, and fulfill wine orders.  You have enough workers to do all of those each turn, so must prioritize and attempt to take advantage of bonuses, like extra harvest or allowing grapes and wines to age.

It's a decent, semi-heavy worker placement game that doesn't feel like you're merely pushing cubes around, but there is a lot of opportunity for analysis paralysis, especially after another player takes the one action you absolutely needed to execute your perfect plan to dominate in wine-making.  The game feels like it takes too long to play considering how little there for you to actually do.  I think it plays best with 5 players.

My partner got this one through Kickstarter, with a lot of expansions included. The expansions are gradually introduced in a rather interesting way: you play the game and log the scores each time and the person who won gets to choose which expansion to add next time, from the ones available.

The art on this is quite nice and the board is easy to navigate, there are no bits that are too crowded, which is a problem that I've seen in other games. I like the kind of decisions you have to take during the game - you have to choose whether you want to make sure you're first player or whether to go for a particular or more useful item from a list and which things to buy in order to do more things. Some things are down to luck (say, which contracts you get) but you definitely have to make good decisions. I found myself planning ahead a few turns to be able to fulfil more complicated contracts just in the nick of time to beat my opponent (I usually play 2 players games).

One game played and it's great.  Unlike Agricola this feels less in-your-face.  You always have options and never really feel you are getting screwed by another player.  Good stuff.

Many plays later it's strongly contending to be my go-to worker placement game.  Mainly, it's not a "screw your neighbor" type of game which works great with the folks I normally play with.

I think Viticulture is a good game because it brings some new gameplay aspects to the worker placement category.  Deciding how many workers to use in summer and how many to save for winter is a tough choice.  The cards are all pretty powerful but some are noticeably weaker in my opinion.  I like the aging of grapes and wine.  I also like that the player has a lot of choice in this game because there are several buildings that you can build to fine tune your strategy.  The theme is certainly there.  The game seems meant to be played while drinking something.

Beautiful game components, especially the various types of structures. Reasonably high player interaction while gameplay has both strategic and tactical layers.

2nd edition rules moved this from 7 to 8.  We mitigate the randomness between vines and orders with a simple variant:

1) Separate red and white vines, shuffle, and place the red stack on top.
2) Separate 1 and 2 lira orders, shuffle, and place the 1 lira order stack on top.
3) Draws may be taken from either the top or bottom.

These changes have greatly increased our enjoyment by providing a bit more control to match up vines with orders without adding the AP associated with a card draft.

Solid worker placement game by a designer who clearly has some passion for his chosen subject (wine, of course.)  Great production values for a kickstarter game.  Easy to understand rulebook.

Worth a look unless you hate the theme which is fairly prevalent.

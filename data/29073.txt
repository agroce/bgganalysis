Doesn't really work as a 2 player game. There is definitely room to strategize here but the game is more thinky than I really want in this sort of game, and much too long. Not a terrible game, but neither my wife nor I had fun with it. I doubt I'll ever play it again.

RATING: 6
Abstract of course, but frustrating - perhaps in a good way. It's interesting that you can anticipate what new tiles you might pull, but not when you will have them. This leads to some rough decisions on where to place. Every spot can be covered by 3 tiles (not including your wild tile) - but if two have already been played, how long will you risk for a third to appear? It's alright - and certainly gets off the table in a hurry.

RATING: 6
An interesting game, I like that you always get to draw all of your tiles so its the order thats random, not what tiles you will get overall. Some strategy in the timing of what you do.

Upon further plays, I find it still a bit random, you can get really hurt by the order of your tiles compared to the others.

The new rules on scoring groups plus highest colour eaten works much better, much more interesting game as a result.

Can't stand the new name blockers though, awful retheme or un-theme.

Oh, and just because the game is played on a 3x3/9x9 grid it is nothing like Sudoku, not in the slightest

RATING: 6
An abstract tile-placer in which the object is to end with as few groups of tiles as possible and to capture as few of your opponents' tiles as possible.  With five players, the board is claustrophobically tight and the game and your opponents quickly present you with some angsty decisions.  Played with three there is altogether too much space and most of the tension is gone.
 
The box is bright and loud, the board is bleached and dull.  Production quality is decent; the board is a nice thick lump of plastic and the tiles and their racks are OK.  The rules are laudably brief and fairly comprehensive.  We did argue a bit about the smaller group captures rule.

i found this quite playable but thoroughly disappointing.  not a whole lot going on.  don't like the rule about not being able to target players the way you might want, but the game might completely break down if that were allowed.  maybe there could be some safer middle ground regarding protected pieces, but i still don't see myself wanting to play the game.  toward the end it's clear who has a shot and who doesn't, but everyone has to keep on playing anyway.

RATING: 7.5
While there is a theme, the game is an abstract through and through.  It is in a rare group of abstract games that actually plays better with more players.  Played with a full 5, the game is quite challenging without the normal chaos associated with muli-player games.  The game is weakest as a 2 player game, but still playable.  For fans of Sudoku, this may be a good gateway game as the placement of tiles on the grid has a bit of the Sudoku feel (although game mechanics have nothing much to do with Sudoku).

This game should have very wide appeal as I feel I can bring this out to non-gamers and gamers alike.  It also seems like an ideal game to pull out when with the family as well.  The game is simple to explain, provides interesting choices and doesn't outstay it's welcome.  This one hits the sweet sweet spot in a lot of areas.

Thoroughly absorbing tile laying game based on Suduko board.  Similarities to O'Kudos.  A perfect 'spouse' game to sit alongside the likes of Lost Cities and Mosaix.  Scales well up to 5.  Also recommend Kory Heath's variants: (i) set $ tile aside, draw as required (ii) count groups plus number of tiles of opponent that you have captured the fewest tiles off.  Equally good game but with a refreshing twist.

I'm not usually big on abstracts. but I really enjoyed this game. I played with five players, and the board was really tight, but it was a great time. It apparently scales really well from 2-5. The rules are extremely simplistic, but there's a lot of strategy in it. I think it would be great for non-gamers.

UPDATE: In the 2-player game, you have to play two colors--separately, as in you play them as if they're played by two different people, although you can't capture tiles from one of your colors with tiles from the other color. It's a much, much harder game, trying to coordinate the two. Not sure  yet if I like it with 2.

UPDATE 2: I played this with 3 players after not having played it in a few years, and it wasn't nearly as fun as I'd remembered. We were each free to expand our areas without bumping into anyone else for a long time. It wasn't until the end that the real essence of the game came through. I don't think I'd play it with 3 again.

One play, two player.  Played with Uptown rules.  It is a cool abstract filler that I think would really shine with 3+ people.  Probably 3 would be optimal.  Some good tactical decision making to be had.  I enjoyed my play.  I am thinking of trying with the Blockers scoring rule with tile taken are combined with groups.

I`am not a fan of abstract games, but this one is quite good. 
Minmal rules packed in a nice game-tile package, which is short with minimum downtime, but with adequate enough game depth.
You have to make the best play from the choice of 5 tiles. Only 4 of your 28 tiles won`t be used so you can/must plan clever ahead and try to get a minmal number of your tiles groups.

Kind of a fun "throwback" game: even though it apparently came out in 2007 it seems like it could have been designed thirty years ago.

Wool is made of wool-like properties, so BUG off and grab a hat, and if the hat don't fit, a comet will break through the ceiling of the stratosphere and envelop your scarf and take it back into space to show it off to its comet buddies, who will wonder what the comet is talking about since wool burns and comets are hot, thus the comet would not still have the scarf around it's comet body, and therefore the other comets would not see the scarf that s not there, and that is why they would laugh and the other comet would feel ashamed that it is hot, and that it burned the scarf and it would commit cometcide. Poor wool.

RATING: 8
I actually enjoyed this much more than I expected; the reviews made it sound like a lame version of Manhatten, but that's totally not the case. It's a clever, fast-playing, and interesting connection-type game where you need to get all your tiles down into as compact an area as possible. Simple rules give way to nuanced tactics, which is good.

The theming is a total misfire, though. This would have been much better done as a dressed-up abstract, a la Keltis, than with the somewhat tortured theme we have here; the background paragraph explaining the theme makes me cringe. Even a completely abstract game would have been an improvement, although I guess those don't sell. Anyway, surely a better approach to theme could have been devised; a lot of us care about that.

The problem is, the 2-player game category is, for me, now so filled up with great games I don't have time to play, stuff like Jambo, Lost Cities, Blue Moon, Race for the Galaxy, and the GIPF-series games, that there just isn't a lot of space for more for me personally.

40+ plays (26x3p, 6x4p, 6x5) - tight game, easy to teach, with strategies and tactics.  Fast turns. A winner.  Makes a lot of just a few rules. Too bad it doesn't have a theme, really, but I like the artwork, colors and graphic style.  I do wish that one set of the horizontal and vertical labels were oriented the other direction to be right side up for players facing that way.  It doesn't look like a game with player conflict, but the collisions can be quite intense (especially so with 5 players).

I'm surprised how much I like Uptown.... Maybe it should become a classic given a game with such easy rules, very fast play, meaningful decisions and related delicious game-tension --all that, and yet it is also a family game. I may need to raise my rating. I'm quite impressed with it. Brutal, tense, can't breathe = fun!

5p a lot tighter than 4p!  3p seemed to work fine.

As I play more, I'm discovering more tactics, and so are my opponents!

If I had a nickle every time someone asked me, "Why is there a die in the corner? and that Yin-Yang symbol?" ...I'd have about fifty or sixty cents.

Sudoku/crossword like tile placement. Goal is to minimize number of connected regions, overplay is permitted if it doesn't increase opponents number of regions. The random tile draw is a bit obnoxious given how little is occuring in this game, but it's possible (I think) that with enough play the order of the draw can have a minimal impact.

RATING: 6
Components: Simple, utilitarian components.

Experience: Not as straight forward as I thought it would be. There is little incentive to not play straight through all of one color first (in a two-player game), because if I'm stalled on a color, that color won't improve with time (i.e. I must play the color to draw more tiles, and my opponent might close up certain areas while I wait. There are definitely opportunities for cleverly avoiding redundancy in my chain of tiles, thus preventing an opponent from breaking through.

A good multi-player abstract game. Plays quick but has some good strategy choices to offer the players.

A near perfect family/gateway game - both strategy and tactics here for gamers but with a rule set explaininable to the non-gamer in two minutes and with enough luck that everyone has some chance of winning.

The theme (I have the Uptown version) is nowhere and for me was a deterrent to trying the game - should have gone themeless.

But after a while it starts to be clear what kind of moves are better then other and then the one who gets better tokens is in favor position.

I still recommend this to play once in a while.

Nice gateway game. Scales well with 3 to 5, an easy ruleset and nonimposing board. there is also a well-perceived sense of urgency which I believe is essential for a good gateway game. In the future, I see myself choosing this over Blokus to bring places since it has a better scaling range. There's a good chance this will make it into my heavy rotation for couples games.

[1 play] This game was OK, but I found it somewhat annoyingly unintuitive.  First it seemed like you'd want to take other people's tiles, but that turned out to be bad.  The game goal and end scoring also weren't what they seemed, or what my brain was inspired to think of by the gameplay.

Originally released as "Uptown".  Decent abstract game with quick play time, has elements of Blokus and LOTR: Confrontation.  
See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/376605

Now released as "Blockers" with this change to the win condition: "The new rule is that at the end of the game you count the number of your groups and the number of your captures of the color you captured most, and add these numbers together; the player with the lowest total wins."

Blockers! is a vastly underrated game. There are, IMO, a few reasons for its obscurity. First, the game is an abstract which is usually enough to kill most game's prospects. Second, the game looks like a bizzare Sudoku variant. Third, the overall presentation is not very exciting -- perhaps by nature. Regardless of these factors Blockers is easily my favorite luck-filled abstract. While the game certainly contains a luck factor, the hand size is large enough to mitigate much of the luck ivnvolved. At the same time, the hand size is small enough to add a delicious tension your blocking prospects. I enjoy Blockers most with two players, though the 3 player game is quite fun. Beyond three however the game becomes quite hard to plan for, though I'll still play it from time to time.

Blockers is a pleasant enough abstract, though a lot of luck comes down to the tiles that are drawn.  However, there are enough options for play that one can strategize as much as rely on lady luck to come through. I like my abstracts to have has little luck as possible. This one has a heavier dose but I might appreciate it with further plays.  Currently listed at '7' but could go down.

Uptown is a quick multiplayer tile placement game played on a 9x9 grid.  Each tile is indexed according to where it can be played: either one specific row, one specific column, or one specific 3x3 region (divided like a Sudoku grid).  Players are trying to keep their own tiles confined to as few orthogonally-connected blobs as possible.  Fewest blobs wins, with ties awarded to the player who performed the fewest captures.  Not a terribly deep game, perhaps, but deep enough that I see new subtleties each time I play.  Uptown serves nicely as a filler between longer games, and often gets played twice in succession.

First played February 26th, 2008. Taught in ~5min, played in ~25min with 3-4 players. Goal is to have the least groupings of tiles. Board is constructed to have numbers accross one side(x), letters down the other side(y), and 9 grouping of 9 squares with pictures on them. Each player has a stack of tiles 1-9, A-I, one of each of the 9 pictures, and 1 $ special tile. Each player draws 5 tiles at random to start and places them in thier rack. On your turn, place a tile in the letter row, number column, picture quadrant, or $ anywhere. Players may capture other player tiles and place their tile if it doesn't break a grouping that the opponent has. When players draw their last tile, they get one last round and the game is over(4 tiles remaining). Ties go to player who captured the least. It's a great filler and recommend as a borrow and give consideration in purchase.

Apr08: A very pleasant suprise.  It's a pure abstract, but it's a very enjoyable one at that.  On a similar level to Blokus.

The rules are very easy to get across to people, and the game play seems to move at a very brisk pace.  Each turn you get a very juicy decision and your turns come around nice and fast.

I also really enjoyed the forced confrontation.  You are going to run into the other players and tiles are going to clash.  The "nicest player" wins tie break is just too cute.

UPDATE APR11 Lowered rating a little. Still a game I enjoy playing, but only with four or five players. Still my favourite filler for four or five players.

UPDATE JUL09. Raised my score again. Can't say the game is an 8 using BGG standards, but it is popular and playable (well) by complete newcomers.Best use of Soduku style board I've seen. Enjoyed the game but it seemed to be down to the luck of the tile draw (I won the game I played).

***

UPDATE FEB09. Raised my score from 6 and have bought the game. More to the game than I first thought and enjoy the game with 2, 3 or 4 players.

Will play again but doubt I'll buy it, even though it appears to be a sound implementation of a good idea.

Kind of felt like a puzzle to me.. maybe even a little like Take it to the Limit! and Cities... everyone gets the same set of pieces and you are trying to put them together the most efficient way possible as to have only one orthoganaly connected area... though unlike Limit or Cities everyone's pieces come out into ones hands to play in different orders and everyone is using one board instead of each having private board/play area.

... thinking about it little more Blokus also comes to mind, even more similiar in that all players on same board, all same set of pieces... and pieces go on board in different order (though Blokus has no luck).

Totally a preliminary rating. I have only one play under the belt. I will postpone a rating until more plays happen.Initial thoughts: good game, challenging, quick to learn, good game for families. Initial wonders about a death spiral depending on tile draw. You may have little choice on where to play at the end and may have to start creating new groups (which will lose you the game). I had a lot of tough choices on where to play and wasn't sure what my tile count was. It was only one game though and I learned the tile set by the end of it.I'd put it inline with an Ingenious and Blockus level of play. Simple, but challenging. It may grow with more plays, but the end game (you know who's winning and you know you can't catch or fracture his areas) may limit it a bit to much for me in the end.Be aggressive early.

Blockers! is an excellent abstract game which I feel should belong in everyone's collection.  It's such an easy game to learn, but it really takes a lot to master it.  I really like how the "capture" mechanic works and can be a big decision on whether to take advantage of it or not.  While the components are limited, they're functional and the board is made so well, I could imagine playing this on a bumpy road and not running into many issues with jostling pieces.  Seriously though, there's an excellent abstract strategy game here that I feel has been overlooked.  It plays well from 2 - 5 and certainly plays different at each count.  Lovely little game.

RATING: 8
Uptown is a light tile laying game played on a Sudoku-like grid. The nine regions of the board each have their own image. Also columns are numbered and rows are lettered. The tiles either have a number, a letter, or a picture and can be placed in any corresponding column, row or area when played from your hand of five tiles. The objective is to group your tiles on the board so that you have the fewest groups of tiles at the end of the game. Opposing pieces can be placed on and captured as long as the placement would not split a group in two. In the event of a tie, which I would guess happens frequently, it is the player who has captured the FEWEST tiles that wins.

The game has a fair bit of luck in the tile draws, but for the most part there are enough options for placement that you do have impactful decisions to make on each turn. With five players it played in 20 minutes. It seems the game would play equally well with any number between 2 and 5, you'd just have more space and less captures with fewer players, but that doesn't fundamentally alter the game. It's the kind of game you sit back, socialize, sip lemonade, and just enjoy without any seriousness. Great for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've only played with 3 players.  It's nothing great so far.  Maybe more players would be more interesting.  We rarely "block" each other.  No need to capture an opponent's tile.  No alternate setup for 3 players that might address this.  At 4-5 players, you would be forced to capture, because there aren't enough spots on the board.  Maybe that will make it more interesting.  Fails as a 3 player game.  Maybe next time I will house rule a reduced play area to force more conflict.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Surprisingly not as bad as I thought. Initial presentation judging from components and name of the game is that it looks horribly dull. But there is some decent strategy to it and you can predict what others are doing (and need to do so) quite well and take that into account.

'Uptown'

Randomness can win or lose the game sometimes, or for closely-matched players, but even so, it's very fun, and requires many delicious decisions!  I love it.  

Medium- to light-gamers all really like it, and it takes very little time to teach the simple rules.
 
The 2-player version works very well!  In the 2-player version, each player takes 2 colors, but decides for himself which of the 2 colors to play each turn.  And this feels really good and interesting, unlike Blokus for example, in which taking 2 colors each feels annoying and artificial.

Update:  After ~35 games, I'm a little disappointed that the strategy of                                            hugging 2 walls may be your best strategy in some games, but it is not as much fun when you or anyone else plays that way.  But still, always a fun game.

Update:  The game gets a new lease on life by trying the new scoring rule: Win by having the minimum (# groups + # captures).  This makes it less cutthroat (which is a shame, actually), eliminates the hug-the-wall strategy (which is good), but most importantly just makes it a slightly new and different game.  If these are the scoring rules you first used, then some time you should also try the old scoring rules (Win by having the minimum # groups; if tied, win by having the minimum # captures.)  These old scoring rules are more dramatic; e.g. it can be very important to you to finish a horizontal wall before that other player forever blocks it off with her vertical wall.

My goodness, this is probably the most tacked-on theme for any board game ever but it's a simple, fun game that's very intuitive, with little downtime, simple interaction between players, and plays fairly quickly. Really, aside from having fun (and Uptown is fun) that's about all I could ask for in a board game. This plays a little like Sequence but I enjoyed the spirit of this game much more than I ever did Sequence.

I suggest playing your favorite 20s music while you play. It also helps to get into character and say profound 20s witticisms like "Now, here's the deal, see ... "

RATING: 6
Fun tile laying abstract game with some strategy and a little luck.  Board is similar to a Sudoku game but with letters along one side (A-I), numbers on the other (1-9) and different pictures in each of the 9 sections. Tiles selections are held in scrabble type holders but each player’s mix is picked randomly so this can lead to some lucky draws. Nevertheless, there is certainly some strategic decisions that certainly should be made including factoring in some odds calculations and leaving open the best options for long term planning.

RATING: 6
Excellent quick filler in which you seek to get your tiles connected in as few groups as possible.  Almost Sudoku like in appearance but much better!  Each player has a tile for each column (letters A - I), row (numbers 1-9), and each 3x3 grid (symbol) along with one wild.  You have 5 of your tiles available to play each turn where you play one and then draw one. 

I am a bit concerned that this is rapidly becoming more of a whoever draws the right piece at the right time wins the game type of game.

Desribed to me as "competitive Sudoku", which overestimates the difficulty of this game but gets right the feeling that it evokes in trying to plonk down tiles that can only go certain places on a rapidly-filling board.

Fairly pleasant game, certainly doesn't overstay its welcome.  Works decently as a 20 minute filler.  I would not request it, but would play it if so dunned.

I have the new Blockers! edition. I think this takes Uptown in the direction it really needed to go in its first incarnation: that of a pure abstract without all the lame-theme/roaring 20's business that Uptown had. All plastic board (with helpful slots for the tiles) plastic tiles, and plastic tile-holders. The rules are super simple, a 2-player game takes 10-15 minutes, and the 3-5 player game takes no more than 30 minutes. Perfect for games night warm-ups.

This game has that classic "family game" feel. It is quick to teach. Quick to play. I have yet to teach it to anybody who didn't like it. It plays really well with 3-5 players. 

And yet it doesn't bore me even though I prefer heavy games. I have never turned down a game of it yet. Even at a Con where heavy games abound it can be a great fun brain break that is more interesting than a dice fest filler.

Surprisingly good. Someone used the word cunning to describe this and i think that is exactly right. I enjoy the way more information is revealed as the game proceeds. There is also an element of bluff as you sneak up on an opponent's territory.

Very intriguing game that the people I have showed it to always want to immediately play again after their first game.  Then as the various strategies become more apparent even more times after that.  Extremely short play time (20-30min)and fun factor make this highly rated for me.  I normally don't rate less complex games this highly.  Great party/social game for couples or mixed groups.  Also works well for more hard-core gamers....a unique game that works both ways and is really enjoyable.  Can be quite cutthroat with 5 players which can be fun too.

This game is a dud for 2, not great with 3, but really shines with more, as the competition gets intense and you can't pursue a strategy of isolation. Love the elegance and simplicity of the rules, it's quite quick to explain.
----
Finally got to play a 4er in real life (having only played 4ers on BSW previously) and saw the proof of the above--the scarcity of places to go forces more interactive gameplay than the 3ers, which lack tension. A lot of strategy in this abstract, much more than the garish box suggests--not only do you have to place your current tile carefully, you have to think about what tiles you and your opponents still have coming up so you can plan your next moves too.

Very simple game.

I have the Uptown version; I won't comment anything about the pathetic attempt to find a theme :P

The components are nice, even if the graphic edition is really basic and non attractive.

The game works very fine until the last turns, were everything is quite chaotic and you just depend on luck. Luck will usually make you lose more tan all you've lost up to now, and most probably will decide the winner.

For me, these last turns totally destroy the interest I have on the game. 

Maybe this is less of an issue with less players.

A very clever mechanism: 4 ways to reach a place (letter, number, symbol or $) with an almost perfect information on what is coming and what was used by the opponents. The rule not to separate a group of the same color gives all the spice (and the dynamic of space expansion).

Too bad, it has lot of qualities but is really really not my taste. Didn't manage to get any fun in this abstract game.

RATING: 8
Despite following the well-known path of tile-laying games, Uptown/Blockers does feel fresh and original straight from the first play. Players have indeed to play out tiles on the board to build groups (as few as possible) and can occasionally capture rival tiles, but instead of leaving total freedom to place the tiles and shape the game with loads of rules, Uptown/Blockers is based on a mechanic that is both restrictive and still relatively flexible for a player: a tile can be placed on the board if it matches the row, the column or the symbol of the field it lands on. Thus, each field on the board can accommodate three tiles from the same player, and each tile can be placed on nine different squares on the board.

This seems to be the right proportion -players start out with identical pools of tiles but can only manage five in their hand, so that the decision-taking is easy while players can still "branch out on the board" but becomes more and more difficult towards the end of the game, when each tile laid can mean building a new group. Keeping good tiles in the own hand is obviously very important, but so are the timing and knowing whether and when to attack other players (attacks come at a price!).

The original Uptown rules yield a terrific game for three to five players, adapted very nicely for two players as well. The slight changes in the Blockers edition give the game even more punch.

RATING: 7.5
Uptown is completely abstract; players try to place tiles onto a congested board so that their colour is in one block (or as few separate areas as possible) while also deliberately getting in each others way. Tile placement is restricted to specific rows, columns or sections of the board (the board is arranged like a Sudoku grid). There is considerable scope to annoy the other players.

The board is clear, the tiles are reasonable quality and vibrant. I have no trouble with the colours and there are (tiny) icons for each colour: shortsighted, badly colourblind folks should check the galleries I suppose, but really - this is a good example of the publisher getting it right. Rules are quick, easy and very fast to learn. The game comes in a box similar to a Kosmos 2-p game, but twice as thick, so it packs up nice and small and is very transportable. (Funagain ed)

Surprising good game. At first sight people disregards it, calling it "sudoku" or "battleship". Then, by the end of the game, we all can hear the groaning and whining... :-)

It's surprising because it is SO simple and easy, yet very challenging and entertaining.

RATING: 6
Ok game of joining tiles up across a board to try and form one big group. It's play 1 draw 1 with a hand of 5, with the tiles either being A-I, 1-9, 1 of the 9 Sudoku type sub-squares or your play anywhere tile. Placement is on a Battleship type grid labelled (you guessed it) A-I on 1 side and 1-9 on the other, so placement of a tile has the obvious restriction of only being able to be placed in the row / column / sub-square that it represents. Your challenge is by the end of the game to have 1 completely joined group, which generally means going both up and down AND acrossways. Of course how your tiles come out don't make that easy, nor does the fact that your opponents keep getting in your way. At least you can zap their tiles (overlaying them) as long as you don't split their group into 2 or more groups. Which means you only get to nibble at their edges. Meaning you want big long strings of tiles where tiles can't be taken from the middle. While it's ok and decent to play, there's a fair bit of luck in getting tiles that continue you to allow to extend existing groups (especially early on), there's luck on who your opponents hit, and the game is beset by a lack of tension - you simply play whatcha got. Some fun and not bad, but the abstract nature of the game means a bit more was required to see this back to the table regularly.

Another great logic game. It is a bit similar to Blokus but comparing those two Blockers! has one disadvantage but also one significant advantage over Blokus. The disadvantage is the introduction of randomness to the game as the tiles are drown randomly. This randomness is not big as there are 5 tiles available all the time but in some cases this might block some options. On the other hand, Blockers! allows 2-5 players comparing to 2-4 for Blokus and that's why it lands on my table more often than Blokus.

Players place tiles on the playing board which is a 9x9 grid. The grid rows are labeled A-I and columns are 1-9. The 81 squares are also divided up into nine 3x3 sub-grids, each set of 9 squares labeled with a unique symbol. Each player gets his own set of 28 tiles each tile being a letter A-I, a number 1-9, or one of the nine symbols. Players take turn placing one tile from the 5 tiles they have in their tile rack. The rest of each player's tiles are placed face down to the side as a draw pool for that player.  After each play, the player draws a tile from his own draw pool to replenish to 5. A tile must be placed in any space that matches what's on the tile.  The object of the game is to have the fewest number of your own tile groupings.

The game is fairly straight forward and not very long and is decent and engaging as a filler.  Some tactical plays and minor planning is possible, but ultimately the sequence in which players' tiles come out determine who gets to follow through with their plan and who doesn't.  But again, as a filler it does the job.

Better than expected.  Played 2-player and it took 52 minutes, only a tiny bit too long.  Game can lead to analysis paralysis but if you play with considerate people or carry a cattle prod, that ought to be manageable.  The game does use the old hokey "play two colors" to accommodate two players, but since you can play either color on each turn (rather than playing each color in sequence), it's not so bad.
Update:  Played with 3 players (and one of the players was teamed with our 4.5 year old).  Took only 30 minutes and the 4.5 year old played quite well).  It's a winner, though I think 2, 4, or 5 players would be best.  Too much board real estate when ony 3 play.

Uptown is pretty vanilla, mechanically which makes it's play time feel a bit long. By no means is it bad, just not especially interesting. 

I think it loses extra points because the board and pieces are so blandly, unlovingly produced. I know the theme is essentially irrelevant here, but still: if you choose the roaring 20's, faded cream, black and dull purple are not the best choices for your color pallet.

Kory Heath criou um abstracto que é uma obra-prima da jogabilidade e uma obra de arte sobre a mesa, um jogo para jogar até à eternidade dos tempos e, portanto, indispensável em qualquer colecção. Quase tão bom quanto Blokus, ligeiramente melhor que Genial!

A surprise hit for me.  I'd never heard of it till [[Pionek]] September 2008, where I got roped into a 5-player game and quite enjoyed it.  Sudoku-like map, neat idea for a goal (have as few connected groups as possible), attractive bits.

2009-05-26: played 2-player for the first time, with Maks, and enjoyed it. It uses the common annoying method of having each player take 2 colors, but each turn you can freely choose which of your colors you will play, so that was neat. (Unlike, e.g., 2-player Blokus where I always get confused which of my 2 colors I'm supposed to be playing...)

2009-11: finally purchased. :)

RATING: 6.3
--Aug2008-- Deceptively non-simple game of constrained tile placement.  It's interesting - and probably cooler with more than 2 players.
--Sept2008-- Distinctly more interesting with 5 players.  There's a surprising amount of tension (possibly more than we understood at the beginning of the game) in whether to remove an opponent's tile.  New rating of 7 is with 5p; 2p is a 6 at most.  Not sure about 3p or 4p!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great game, only slightly off parts are that it is prone to king maker decisions in the last 3-4 rounds, that can kind of make it suck a bit more.  Also, with 3 it's not great, but with 2, 4 or 5 players I think it's good.

What a surprise! An incredible simple rule-set yet a surprising amount of tactical play! I also found that it works very well as a gateway game due to this factor! Highly recommended!

[b]Edit:[/b] Surprisingly, with five players it felt chaotic and messy and with three players it felt too open and non-confrontational. Four player is the sweet spot. Dropped the score a half a point as it doesn't scale that well. Still, four player is aces!

There actually is a game here.  Unfortunately, it's really not that good of a game.  At its heart, it is a connection game of sorts.  Unfortunately, you are really limited in your options, particularly with the rules for breaking up anothers chain.  The result of this is that the tiles you draw can severely limit your flexibility and your long-term prospects.  It doesn't matter if you can see the one spot on the board you absolutely have to play in if you can't get there.  I would play this again, but there are much better options out there. [06/29/2009]

Initial thoughts after two 4P games

The Good: Abstract - Easy to learn/teach - Plays quickly - High replay value

The Bad: 2P variant is poor - Slight AP concerns - Needs a cloth bag per person to draw tiles. wifey not a fan.

Chances of getting game to table again: Reasonable

2015 UPDATE: Actually, Wifey loathes this game, thus looks like it's days are numbered. Dropping rating.

I've only played this with five players.  

My first thought when reading the rules was that I'd heard of this somewhere before, and I had (of sorts).  Project Kells has the same sort of objective and victory condition.  The game-play is different, it is much more constrained.  While I see the value in keeping the kinds of moves limited, the game can be frustrating waiting to draw tile connections.  Because of how the tile draw effects the end game it is the narrowing options that actually shift this game's rating down to a five for me. 

I respect games that force players to shift gears and this really does a great job in pushing for players to change their game-play between each third of the game.  In the first third, everyone establishes their position, matching up what they have, there is a nice balance between setting up one spot having it grow safer but more tile dependent, and setting up two spots with more options allowed to matching adjacent tiles. In the second you worm your way into the mix, pushing position and trying to secure your chains, this can be rather exciting.  But by the last third it is abundantly clear who is not capable of winning the game.  

This is a game that could really benefit from player elimination.  In the end game it is clear what tiles are absolutely separated with no hope of getting joined in.  So the players in 4th and 5th have nothing to do but be a nuisance.  You really have to work your hardest not to be a kingmaker.  So your big challenge as a player is how to pretend that you are playing well, while not inadvertently giving the game to someone.  Awesome.

Perhaps if you three areas completely fill up the last place player gets bumped, then after four areas the next player gets whacked.

It also is kind of lame that there is no tiebreaker other than tiles eaten.  It seems like the game wouldn't infrequently end with a tie.

As far as the art design, this is the highest quality prototype I've seen sold on the shelf.  While it is clear (except for the "B"), the kooky clip art and #'s and letters really stress that this is an abstract game.  And what is up with the dice and Yin Yang symbols?  It's a weird one.

A good game of tile placement. Now if only I can remember which tiles I have left to use! I think that making right angles is the way to go as straight lines and clusters get picked off easily.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly good in spite of the appearance. It's got a nice area control/hand management aspect to it that you wouldn't expect from this. Simple rules makes this a decent lighter game.

UPDATE: Leaving this right at a 7, after getting it back to the table after a long absence. It's a really nice light and quick game, where the challenge lies in where to place your tiles so as to build a nice chain and not get blocked out by the other players. Simple rules yet some actual interesting decisions make this a worthwhile game to play in my book.

First played the prototype in 2006.


So, you're trying to place tiles to form a single large group for yourself, while forcing opponents to create multiple groups. Of course, since you only see 5 of your tiles at a time, and opponents are trying to do the same thing, that may be difficult. There's some strategy in trying to set up defensive positions: you know which tiles everyone has played, so you can work towards orienting your group(s) so that any capture opponents would like to play would force a split for you (and therefore be illegal). There's enough open information for the game to slow down a bit at the end, as everyone tries to figure out exactly what's left in someone's hand. But that isn't a significant problem: the game plays quickly and it's lightish but tense.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There's a 9x9 grid, divided Sudoku-style into 9 3x3 boxes. Each box has a symbol, and each row and column have a number and letter. Players have tiles marked with every number, letter, and symbol (=27 tiles) and one wild ("$") --> 28 tile total. Players mix their tiles face down and keep a hand of 5 in a Scrabble-style rack. On your turn, play a tile then draw a tile. You may place your tile in any space that matches the symbol on it. If another player's tile is already there, you can capture it as long as it doesn't split a group of contiguous tiles. Continue play until everyone has drawn their last tile, then play one final round (4 tiles left unplayed per player). 

The player with the fewest groups wins. The tie-breaker: the player with the fewest captured tiles wins. 

[b]--- Key Variants ---[/b]
1. Separate the dollar tile and place it face up so that (i) it cannot be chosen as part of your set up tiles and (ii) can be chosen when desired at any point in the game. This reduces the luck element resulting from the timing of when you draw the games most powerful piece. Out of choice I would now play this rule as standard.

2. Scoring. Score = (the number of groups you have) + (the number of tiles you have taken from the opponent that you have taken most tiles from). This change gives rise to a whole different strategy and makes for an interesting alternate game. Well worth a try, even just before four in the morning. 

3. In 2-player game, play with 2 colors each. You ARE allowed to capture your own tiles, but only if using your other color.

I've played four-player (best) and two-player (still very good) and five-player (a bit too little control for my taste).  It's not as good with three players (not enough tiles on the board to make tension). It's a light game, close in spirit to Ingenious, Blokus, Qwirkle, etc.  If you like those, you'll probably like this one.

When this got broken out, I was a little unsure. First, it looks pretty plain, and while we all know that looks aren't anything, it can be hard to get excited about a game you know nothing about when there's no flashy FFG art or anything on it. Plus, the board struck me immediately as very like that of Acquire, which is a good game, but one I am awful at. But we gave it a try with our group of four, and I actually found it a pretty enjoyable brain-burner of a game. I'd like to try it again with five, since I feel like the game could only be better with more jostling. What makes Uptown is its tie-breaker system. See, the goal is to get as few contiguous groups of tiles in your color as possible (i.e. ideally, all your tiles should be in one big group). To accomplish this, you may bump other player's tiles off the board with your own (under certain conditions). But at the end of the game, ties are broken by who has done so the LEAST. So you have to ask yourself whether it's worth it, or, even better, try to force your opponents to eat your tiles. I ignored this aspect at first--I'm used to shoving "tiebreaker rules" into the back of the mind, since they're rarely used--but ties are frequent in this game, and this part ultimately makes the game work as well as it does. I'd definitely give this another shot, especially with five people, because it was a fun time. It's nothing I'd ever own, though, I think.

Uptown (or the newly named "Blockers") is a fine way to pass time, but it doesn't feel like much of a game.  I'm not sure you have any control at all unless you play with less than 4 players.  Unfortunately, that becomes boring as you have too much room to work.  I'm not likely to recommend this one to many people because there's just nothing there.

That said, it gets a decent amount of plays by me because my family enjoys it.  It's better than nothing, but not a game I'd ever suggest.

An intersting abstract, works very well with 4. The new rule which includes (some) captures in the final score as well as groups makes the new Gryphon/Pegasus edition a much more thoughtful and interesting game.

Players place their tiles trying to create the fewest groups by the end of the game. Every tile has a different placement constraint, and players have to make the best decision each turn from a hand of 5 tiles.

Score would be higher if there were less randomness. Some suggested variants already address this.

A very abstract game, but it is quite simple and offers some reasonably interesting play.  It's important to realize that every tile will be available to you by the end of the game, so plan accordingly.  You can afford to have multiple groups as long as the connecting spaces can be filled with tiles that haven't come up yet, and as long as noone blocks the space before it does.  If you aren't afraid to capture tiles, it is hard for apponents to block you unless they are already near the space you need.  Also realize that you won't use every tile (4 are left at the end).  Some of these will be symbol tiles since it isn't practical to join all such widly divergant areas.

There aren't a lot of multiplayer abstract games, but Uptown is one that does a couple of things right.  You don't have a ton of choices to make, but there's enough that you can track and anticipate to help you make good decisions.  Being able to place a piece based on one of three characteristics is neat, and the idea of playing a piece in the hopes that another player will steal it from you adds just the right amount of risk in placement.  There's not much you can do to slow someone else down, but it's pretty good for what it is.

If players tie for the fewest number of groups at the end of the game, then the winner is the one who captured the fewest opponents' tiles.

This was fun, but it seemed fairly random. I'm still not sure about a strategy that could be used to win the game.

Totally abstract which is not my usual cup of tea, but I like it. It's quick, supports multi-player, has definite luck element, and allows for ganging on leader play (dependent on tiles drawn of course).

Excellent abstract game with a 'oooh which one shall I play first' type of push your luck. I really enjoy it.

Based on a single play. Has a few clever plays to make, but feels a lot like Lost Cities, where you want to try to delay doing anything important for as long as you can. Perhaps there is more to it than I discerned in a single play.

UPDATE:

This game can be played mean or not mean.  I prefer mean. (Bumped up my rating half a point.) 

-----------

A simple tile-laying game in which players attempt to keep their tiles in as few groups as possible.  (The game rating could go up or down, but 6.5 seems like a reasonable starting point.) 

This quick game is exclusively available through Fungain, a game distributor/store which seems to require that game tiles should have the smoothest possible surfaces available.  Apparently, tactile sensations are big selling points in games.

After 2 plays, I understand it. You are trying to connect all of your tiles into the fewest connected groups. 1 is the goal. You have tiles with numbers 1-9 (columns), letters A-I (rows), and 9 pictures (9 sections of the board) and one joker. The ring section is the 9 spots at the crossing of 4-5-6 columns and A-B-C rows. So you could play 4-5-6-A-B-C-ring-joker in that section. You can cover another players piece as long as it does not break the group. You collect the covered piece and it becomes part of the tie breaker, if needed. Most people seem to like it, if they have good spacial skills.

Played 3 times (with 3 to 5 players). There is something I don't get about this game, but I don't know what. It works rather well, with some nice design choices, and the lack of a real theme does not bother me. It is not entirely obvious to play, yet not too difficult either, and plays in a reasonable time for a game of that caliber. But, for some reason, I don't have fun when playing this game.

Fun abstract area control game that plays very fast.  As a short, easy to teach game, I think this is excellent.

Unexpectedly tense from a game that really doesn't look like much at first glance.  Require players to constantly changing tactics as spaces are closed off, as well as new possibilities opening up as a result of someone else's moce.  I have two concerns: one is the scalability.  We played with 5, which I like because the board filled up very quickly and there are a lot of vying for control, but is the experience equally good with less?  The other is due to the strict placing rules, towards the end there are placements that just does not benefit the player, not only does it increase the downtime, wasted and useless action just seem like a poor design.

Even so, I did like Uptown, and would consider it a game to introduce to non-gaming friends and family.

There is winning strategy - place all of your tiles on the edges of the board and you won`t lose until somebody will do everything to destroy you.

After 2+ Plays: When someone compared it to sudoku, I became immediately uninterested.  However, it turns out to be quite a fun little game.  I like how the board situation encourages conflict but the scoring penalizes it.

A good filler. There is a lot of planning that goes into what seems to be a fairly light game. The conflict is not terribly malicious, and rarely does it adversely affect someone. I would definitely play this again.

$Free. It is a good game, but is missing one tile.

A tile-laying game that works very well for 3-5 and provides a good amount of tension. The artwork is very unappealing, as well as the (unnecessary) theme. The game itself, though, is both inexpensive and a fun struggle.

Cada loseta puede ser colocada en 1 de 9 casillas del tablero. Tu objetivo es tener la menor cantidad de grupos. Cada grupo está formado por losetas conectadas de tu color.

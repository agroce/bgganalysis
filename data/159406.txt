GAME: Portal: The Uncooperative Cake Acquisition Game
RANK: 2810

Think there must be something wrong with the rulebook / our interpretation of it as it seems there is only one possible endgame trigger which takes AGES to meet. Actual rating anywhere between 2 and 6.5 depending on this

RATING: 5
I believe this game could last forever; there's no timer mechanic.  It's definitely got some cool ideas, and I think the theme integration is good.  But the game is lacking...something.  The cards seem to make the game rather swing-y, and the portals are not all that important.  Really great box.  The production is good, but the tile design isn't the best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Portal is an entertaining, easy to learn, strategic game. The goal of the game is to have the most Cake on the board as possible, but others can terminate your cake. GLaDOS also eliminates rooms at the end of each players turn which could kill your test subjects or pieces of cake. I learned during the second game that you can use GLaDOS to your advantage if you make the right moves. Turrets and companion cubes are also annoying but can be used for your own personal gain. The game is really fun, somewhat quick, and has lots of replay value since the rooms are almost always different.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game at all. It takes a little bit to catch on to, but there is a lot of variation and there are lots of opportunities for good strategy and ideas. definitely has good replay value as well with the varying boards and the element of aperture cards revealing a new active character. my first play did not capture me, but nearly six months later a second play has me looking at it more favorably. A third play could potentially bump my rating up again. it did run long however, and we were a little tired by the end.

RATING: 3
The board game of the computer game. I'm sure that if you liked the computer game, you'd enjoy it. I haven't played the computer game, so all the jokes were lost on me. And this is really a thinly themed abstract game.

With cake. Real cake, apparently.

Or something.

Wee?

But the rules are simple, and it is easy to pick up. Whether that's enough for you, that's another matter entirely.

RATING: 7
provisional 8 rating after most of a full play @ gencon 2015. In the game you are in a set of test rooms, 3 rows wide. GladOS is trying to kill your test subjects by once a turn destroying a room on the old edge of the rooms and moving it to the new edge. You control which room is destroyed, and if you have a test subject in it (or the majority of test subjects if other players are there as well) you get the reward printed on the room, usually placement of additional test subjects, and then either cards or cake. You win if you have the most cake on the board when the game ends, which is triggered by someone having no test subjects on the board (you start with 4 of 8 I believe), or someone trying to place a 7th piece of cake (you only have 6). Cake is incinerated if it is in a room that is activated (destroyed). 

You can play any number of cards per turn, and you also acquire them if you move only one test subject on a turn (you can move one, or all of your subjects in a single room. In either case, to an adjacent room). The cards match the theme well to the source material. e.g. excursion funnel moves all of your test subjects in a row to an adjacent room. reuplsion gel moves everyone in a room to an adjacent room. When you play a card, you can in lieu of performing its effect, instead place two portals and move through them. This lets you set up some interesting plays sometimes. You can also drop turrets killing everyone in the room it is in, and the companion cube that removes the associated reward from the room that it is in. 

Test subjects can pick up and move cake so once it's placed you want to move your own cake away from the old edge that is being destroyed, and move your opponents cake toward it if possible. You are trying to get to the old edge with at least some test subjects anyway so that you can get rewarded for being in the activated room. So there is a definite tension in your trying to do multiple things at once.

Ultimately, not *quite* as puzzly as I might have hoped for, but it kind of retains the zaniness of the portal 2 online mode where it is hilarious and fun to mess up your buddy as you work through a course. I would rate this one as a 2 on the bgg heaviness scale, but I think it's interesting enough to warrant a purchase. AFAIK it was completely finished as it was presented. Components are nice, if not amazing. The room tiles are hexes but with odd attachments (cut outs producing long extended bits of cardboard). Concern that these will be destroyed over time as even in the freshly printed demo copy they were sticking and not coming apart well when moving rooms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A little bit nuanced and difficult to explain to new players. Some mechanisms (tags, Glados token, Activate/Recycle distinction) unnecessary for faster play. Very cut-throat competitive and winning status can change on a dime, but rule modifiers keep it fresh and fun throughout the game.

RATING: 6
We really just got this one for the neat little plastic pieces and to put on show in our games room with our other Portal stuff. Not a great game by any stretch and doesn't really feel like the Portal PC games. Its artwork comes from Valve's original promo videos which is great but unless you've seen them, you might not really understand what that has to do with the game. Gameplay is fine on its own but isn't terribly exciting.

RATING: N/A
conceptually difficult to teach, but most figure it out halfway through. The constant change and management of people and rules this game is really fun but you have to have the right people because if players don't get it they give up easy which makes this not a casual game.

RATING: 3
Great components. The game itself has the potential to last way too long, like munchkin. The cards you draw are incredibly random. Not only does the card let you do something, they have a game-altering effect that goes into effect on the next turn. The mechanics are kind of wonky and not very intuitive. 

I suggest room 25 instead. It has claustrophobic trap rooms, cooperative or semi-cooperative play modes, and it certainly does not overstay it's welcome like this game does.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun, manic game in which you're moving Test Subjects and Cake around while trying to eliminate the other players' Test Subjects. I like the 'scrolling' effect of the board, it might not entirely match the Portal Gun from the video games but it does keep that sense of motion going. Otherwise the game does have that Clinical feel from its original version, and the card play insures that the various characters and icons also play into this. If you're into stuff like Fearsome Floors, Lifeboats, or Survive! I think this is a natural recommendation, and it does honor its source material. Components are great, and organ donations are optional.

Maybe I need to play with more strategic players, but it seems too easy to just get one piece of cake on the board then slaughter your people.  Done.  Over in less than 2 minutes.  If you can't achieve that, it's even easier to make it end in a tie, at which point you play again to decide a winner.... ad nauseum.

Plays best with more than 2 players. With only two people playing it becomes a race for the first cake and then to kill off all your test subjects. 

The theme sells this one for me. I love the Portal games, and this designer has done a decent job of making a fun puzzle that fits within the Aperture laboratories setting.

Its ok, but a more top down view for the tiles would have worked better for people sitting on the opposite tile of the table.
A glados figurine instead of the paper thing would have finnished it, and using it to mark the old section of the board instead of the useless placement on the immediatly detroyed tile mechanic.

RATING: 6
What *should* have been must-have title on the license alone, even before the concept photo was released - but at least the components look... ok (for the most part). If only the GLADoS model was an actual,plastic figure, and not a boring cardboard standee... Cards are highly thematic, and provide an interesting variety of effects (though there is only a small selection), and an accompanying soundboard app featuring GLADoS quips specially written for the title is a ridiculously missed opportunity. As is the lack of other components, such as repulsion gel tiles (to persistently require, say, at least 2 subjects to move into the chamber, otherwise they bounce straight into the next one along), and a physical refractor cube (switchable with companion cube), and so forth. Decent enough gameplay, average components of a poor build quality, a decent enough interpretation of an ace license... exactly what one expects from Cryptozoic Games. Far overpriced for what it is, but if found at a decent price, worth trying.

Based on one full play and demo at BGG.con. 

You move your little test subjects around hex-shaped spaces, then move one hex from the right side of the board to the left. The player with the most amount of subjects on that hex gain rewards based on icons shown. The idea is to collect cake pieces and then trigger the game end by having one player lose all of their test subjects. There are action cards, rule-changing characters, portal guns, and a few other game-altering mechanics.

Game seems underrated. The group I played with were all impressed with the mixture of abstract and thematic elements. ("It's like if Fluxx were good," one said.) Perhaps Portal fans were expecting more? I admit that I have only briefly experienced the video games. I fully expected this to be another straightforward and forgettable Cryptozoic release, but I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth a try at least.

Only thing I don't like are the structure of the hexes. The interlocking tabs don't work very well. I would have preferred they just not lock at all.

It wasn't horrible.  The way the tiles recycle is fairly interesting, and I appreciate how you can see the face-up item cards, thereby giving you the choice between claiming it and taking extra move actions.  However, the cutting on the tiles is far too tight for a game where you are constantly relocating them.  The game far surpassed my expectations, at least.

Played once. It's decent, but went a little long with 4 players. It's heavier than I wanted it to be, which you may like, but felt a bit out of place given the humor of the source material. The pieces are really nice, except for the largely unnecessary GlaDOS cardboard token.

RATING: 9
This game is criminally underrated.  High player interaction, lots of options, good mix of strategy and tactics (leans to tactics the higher the player count), and very fast-paced.  It IS more thinky than you would expect, but I see that as a good thing because I enjoy games with good depth.  This game is EXTREMELY "in-your-face."  So if your gaming group loves being huge trolls to each other, then you'll love this game!

Downsides... other reviews are correct about the tile components being too tight.  The overall production quality of the game is very high, but the tiles aren't cut precisely enough for what they are trying to achieve.  If they make a second edition of the game, it would be better to make the tiles marginally thicker and into regular hexes (like Catan).  Another option could be to make the square stubs sticking out into a more triangular or rounded shape to allow for easier insertion/removal.  Takes a game or two to get a good grasp of things, but after that you'll be pleasantly surprised to find there's a lot more to it than you initially give it credit for.  High recommend.

Very unique feeling game.  Takes a bit of playing to start to understand what you really want to be doing each turn.  Outside of GlaDOS, components aren't too bad.  A little fiddly with the hexes but worth it IMHO.  Really a game about combining game powers to achieve the most each turn.  You either want to kill your or their subjects off on a turn when you have the most cake or incinerate their last piece of cake. More advanced players will achieve the former.  Underrated but underdeveloped too.

The theme and components are great, the game is not! Maybe it was that we played with 4 players and that's too many, but the game just felt completely random. The fact that you can play 3 cards on your turn and then change the rules 3 times simply causes too much chaos in the game. The card effects are simply too strong, skilled play will have no impact.

Fun and definitely creative but chaotic and difficult to figure out what is going to happen next, so its hard to form any strategy. The room pieces weren't though through very well either as they don't fit perfectly and sometimes get stuck. Overall very fun and would play again.

I have to admit that I was excited for and bought this solely because of the IP. The game is decent, but it's a filler and I was hoping for something a little bit more. 

Edit 17 Jan 2016: got a chance to play this again with "gamers' gamers" at GOWC & found it to be a lot more strategic & fun with more serious players. + the Aperture cards are a lot more interesting when you think about the multi-use card facet of their design.

Surprisingly fun game. I'm a huge Portal fan but negative reception of this game tempered my enthusiasm for it. Got it for the holidays, played it with SO and Mom (non-gamer). Mom said it was her favorite game of the day (Played this, lanterns, and Snow Tails). The game lends itself to alliance making and backstabbing, and card combo/portal placement can make surprising things happen. 

Biggest complaint was the tiles. Quite a few of mine seemed to not be cut well, and the "modular" board was difficult to use. Neat concept, but Cryptozoic really needed to up the component quality to pull it off.

Surprisingly thematic, and it's based around the most memorable moment of the original Portal video game:
[o]When you're told by GLaDOS to stay on the conveyor belt under the false promise of cake.[/o]

The game is a wee bit too chaotic, but also fun and, above all, original. Liked a lot how you have to balance moving your peeps towards the fire, so that you both get rewards and burn other peoples' cake slices, with moving backwards, so as to prevent your own slices from turning into ashes.

What I didn't liked so much was the Fluxx-style rules change, as it removes a lot of the control you otherwise have over the game. If not for that, the luck factor would be very low, and completely manageable.

The components seem sturdy, but I do get the feeling the interlocking board pieces will break if the game sees a lot of use.

In any case, it's a good game, and one I'd certainly play again.

Rating based on 1 2 player game so far. I can see this being very fun in my gaming group. Madcap conveyor belt battle is a cool idea for a game, even though it's not very Portal-y. I suppose you can use the Portal Gun more to make it more thematic, but even without that, I though it was kind of hilariously chaotic.

Have since played 4 player and 2 player again. I still think this is an underrated game that fell flat because it's not quite Portal-y enough.

[b]Surprise Hit of the Con - GenCon 2015[/b]

[u]Comments:[/u]
To start off let me just say that i have never played the Portal video games, and that i have only ever seen footage of someone playing them for a few minutes. Now that that is out of the way let me also say that this was really a surprise at how good this game is. First off, it comes from Cryptozoic which frankly don't make very good games ever, and secondly I knew this game had been mired in issues for at least a couple of years which is why it hadn't been published. The first thing that caught my attention about this game is that the graphic design may be the best that has ever been done for a board game. It is spot on in matching the setting of the game, and the overall tone of the game that you play. The game paly is really simple with you making a choice to move some of your test subjects from one room to another, possibly playing some cards, and then incinerating a room at the front of the board and turning that room over and placing it at the back of the line in one of the three rows. In this way the conveyor belt of rooms keeps moving from turn to turn as test subjects are sent to the fiery pits of hell, and maybe some cake. One of the really interesting design choices in the game is that you can acquire and play cards throughout the game and you play the card to use the advantage for yourself on one side and when you do you place that card face down and that brings out an environmental change to the game (anywhere from using a turret in room, to changing how many cards a player may draw, etc.). This presented the players with some nice double edge swords with the cards they wanted to play. I found the gameplay easy to pickup and very streamlined, and also very fun. this one is right in my wheel house and I will most definitely be picking it up when it goes on sale.

Cryptozooic has a reputation of making poor, licensed games, but Portal may be one of their more interesting ideas. Players find themselves trapped in an ever moving test chamber attempting to acquire more cake than their fellow players by using their AHPD to boost themselves forward while setting their opponents dangerously close to the edge. Plays up to 4 players.

The theme is spot on for Portal in a pleasantly strange way. Glados deciding a chamber to be destroyed every turn, the turret killing every test subject and the companion cube just being a cube. They really got the feeling of Portal on to the table. The only thing that is missing is the puzzle solving within a chamber. It's one step removed from that and instead the puzzle you are trying to solve is the entire board and the actual portals taking a back seat to the overall strategy.

One thing that got on my goat a little is that the plastic insert can't hold all the bits nicely meaning the four lots of player pieces need to be stored underneath the insert instead. A minor gripe but it's a shame it was overlooked during production.

I look forward to playing this with more players, I think 3 might be the sweet spot, however, for now I think it is a very solid 2 player game.

-----

Have played it 3 player a couple of times now and think that it might be best with two players. I think it really depends a lot on the mix of people. Some people just seem to hate it, this may be because the game is a bit on the heavier side.

Still loving it more the more I play.

Captures very little of the feel of the video game.  On the other hand, it comes with a weighted companion cube miniature!

This game straight out of left field is an interesting mash up of euro game mechanics and a very western theme. Said theme is a little pasted on but the mechanics are solid and offer an interesting challenge, and the aesthetic is awesome. Fans of the video game will enjoy the many nods to the lore.

This game feels like the faux happy/corporate ads for Portal 2, the content of which suits the game well. The test chamber recycling is interesting. Game length is short, but that's alright for this humorous "take that!" cake acquisition game.

The game was very flavorful once we figured out how to play it properly.  The little nibs on the cards are extremely annoying and I can see them getting damaged in short order from repeated use.  I think cutting them off and playing on an actual gaming mat would be a much better way to go about things.

I'm a sucker for Portal so I'm sure my higher rating is due in part for my love of the IP. However, I really do think this is a fun, light, very tactical game. It plays much more strategic at 2 players but 4 is just as fun (just much more chaotic). I've played this game more than most this past year just because it's fast to teach and fast to play and provides a fun and unique experience every time I've played thus far.

This was actually quite good. After reading the rules and playing through the first couple of turns, I didn't think this was going to turn out all that great. As the game went along, however, it just got better and better. This is actually a really tense puzzle game that keeps players on their toes constantly...especially with more players. I'll have to try it with 2 to see if I like it more, but I thought this was really well done for being based on a licensed property that happens to be a puzzle game involving physics.

We loved the original video game, but sadly the board game doesn't really appeal to us at all. It's a not-very-fun game with some bits of the plot of Portal slapped on as a theme. It seems like a missed opportunity to make a board game that actually reflects the puzzly nature of Portal.

Don't play this game expecting it to be anything like the video game. That being said, I still found it to be interesting. I like the idea of you needing to incinerate your own test subjects in order to get further in the game. Funnily enough, killing off your own guys entirely is often one of the best strategies to win (in order to trigger the end of the game if you have a lead). the board can be a little fiddly, as you are constantly moving tiles from one side to the other. They have these interlocking sections, but I sometimes wonder if plain hexes couldn't have done the job just fine without making me struggle to disconnect the piece that you are moving to the other side every turn.
Just in case you are worried, there is indeed a portal in the game, but it plays a very minor role compared to the video game--I have seen entire games without it being used.

An obtuse and overly long abstract game with a great theme clumsily laid on top of it. There's nothing in this game I particularly like. I dislike the mechanics, which are unintuitive and difficult to grasp, made worse by the fact that the theme doesn't really tie the mechanics together in any meaningful way. A great game can get away with either unintuitive mechanics or a clumsy thematic fit, but not both at once. I also disliked how long the game lasted. It simply doesn't have the depth or long-term strategy to support its length, and it drags badly by the end of the game.

90% of the game is totally pointless. You just do random actions until someone gets lucky and gets to grab a handful of cake and triggers the end game in one turn. There are a few opportunities for some clever card play, but mostly you will rinse and repeat the same old tactics every turn. Portal could make for a great innovative board game, but this is lazy design. This was not a triumph. I'm making a note here- huge letdown.

I don't like the board quality. The other components are good. I think there is good strategy in the game, yet we rarely play it. If the rotating rooms would interlock better, it would make playing the actual game more enjoyable.

My 10 year old son's favorite game.  Tactical ground war with some game changing double sided cards.  Opportunities for subversion and player to player stabs with twists.  Short - can play 3-6 games in an hour (2-player seems faster, 3-player the ends seem more like a slap in the face).

I don't like the way the board pieces snap together. Kind of a pain to unsnap and snap every time you move them (you move them a lot during gameplay). Maybe they will break in a bit with more play time to make it easier. The game would get a 9 in my book if it weren't for this.

RATING: 7.5
This game does a nice job of emulating the dark humor of the video games, especially with the "uncooperative" nature of this game. You don't have to be a fan of the Portal video games to enjoy the board game, but a lot of the fun factor will be lost if you don't know the references or general moods of the game. I'm very pleased with the game so far. 

And remember: It's all in the name of science, so don't go easy on those test subjects!

Cryptozoic rarely disappoints me and this game is no exception to that.  I demoed the game at BGG Con and immediately bought it.

The theming is fantastic, the pieces are super high quality [I](except one which I'll get to in a second)[/I], the game is easy to understand, and most importantly it's fun.

My only real complaint is the Glados piece.  It's really pointless and feels thrown in.  Additionally, while everything else is super high quality, this is just a little card board stand.  That is my only real disappointment with the game.

This game was a triumph. I'm making a note here, huge success. It's puzzly and funny and random.

I'm not even angry. Even though hubby sent my test subjects to a turret party.

Since there's no use crying over every mistake. You've gotta keep on spawning till you run out of cake. And the play gets done and the game is won. When no body is still alive... ALIVE....

The game was better than I expected it to be. After reading the rules, we expected it to last a long time, but it was over a lot faster than that. Things move quickly and, while there is a lot of chaos, you can definitely manipulate the situation to increase your chances of victory.

I'm a big fan of the Portal series, so the theme was going to be a big influence on how much I liked this game. This game doesn't follow the gameplay style of Portal literally (and I'm not sure who would appreciate a physics game where you had to do the momentum calculations by hand anyway). However, it uses theme well. Test subjects running from chamber to chamber, sentries mowing them down, companion cubes distracting subjects, and subjects valuing cake more than their own lives all fits the universe. The flavor text, art style, and various card abilities all match the video games, too.

While I prefer heavy strategy, economic, and military games, Portal is a great lightweight game that I would be glad to continue to play.

What the? Board game spinoff of a valve software portal universe video game. Cool looking Cake testers minis move around the lab to test chambers while trying to keep your cake out of the incinerator. The modular board is a 3-d illusion of cubed rooms. Board pieces are removed from the front and applied behind? Be the last person with a piece of cake. A beer game twist is thrown in where universal rules are added during game play. And the best thing about this game is resolving a tie by group vote for the person who best justified why they won using 10 or fewer "e-less" words. Must have been baked to design the game. Must be baked to play it.

RATING: 5
Not very good for 2 players, possibly not very good for more.  Far too easy for a player to lose most of their pawns and be left with pretty much no possible move and now way to recover.  The portal theme is well incorporated into the game, but that doesn't mean the mechanics are any good. This is another Cryptozoic failure.

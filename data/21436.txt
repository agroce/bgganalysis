18FL seems to be a great introduction to the 18xx system. I found the game rules pretty easy to understand and was able to hit the ground running during my first game. My opponents had all played 1830 at least a few times. They enjoyed the game, although did mention that the viciousness of 1830 was for the most part lacking here.

I can't really compare this to any other game in the system but can recommend it as an excellent way to start. My one hesitation is to play it again with 4 players; I think 3 players is the preferred number here. I will happily play this a few more times before moving on to something like 18Scan.

My rating of 7 is for the game's success as an introductory experience. I doubt it stands up to some of the truly great 18xx titles, but I think it very much succeeds at its intended goal.

An easy 18xx to get into, but I didn't quite like the action.
There's not much interesting route-action after the first few operating rounds and the last few ORs are all about minor revenue gains.

RATING: 8
Good because quick but a bit too mild I think. At no point I was forced to withdraw payout, as a result all shares were valued practically the same at the end. Additionally, the division with 10-share corporations and 5-share corporations was perceived by me as redundant/too sophisticated.

RATING: 7
A fast 18XX game, but a bit of a strange map. Because of the possibility of laying 2 tracks in a turn, the map is quickly filled. Still a nice game for players with less than 5 hours of time.

Plain vanilla 18xx.  If you have to have a fix and want it to take less than four hours with only three or four people, this'll work.

Pretty good game.  The bridge to Cuba that gets destroyed by a hurricane is a nice touch.  As with most 18XX games, I wish it didn't take so long to play.  I was a bit annoyed that some tiles cannot be upgraded, but I think this is a standard feature of 18XX.  This version is supposed to be one of the shortest versions, but it felt like it took forever.

Fantastic decisions, I think it gives you the feel of a longer 18XX game in a shorter amount of time.  I would love to play this one again, and it makes me want to seek out other 18XX titles.

I very much like this 18xx game.  The company development is very well organized and the game has a good 'feel' to it regarding the ability of the players to manipulate (to a degree) the pacing of the game.  Actually had one of those 'start it again' experiences after the first play.  And with the game only taking 2-3 hrs with experienced players, that was entirely feasible.  The only drawback, in my mind, is this game's auction mechanic; which I very much dislike.

18FL is a pretty nice introductory game for 18xx. It's comparatively short, the one-dimensional stock market is fairly stable, and the route building is mostly constrained by the small map, not by shortage of tiles. Nevertheless it's not as scripted as some of the other intro games, and it does have a few bells and whistles that, while probably a bit confusing for beginners at first, still keep things interesting for more seasoned players.

Great 3 person 18xx.  Interesting tile placement.  Timing the 5-share to 10-share company conversion is intriguing. One question: why does a company's share in the bank's pool capitalize the company?

Also great gateway game into 18xx. Includes some great mechanics like expanding the company that can ruin or boast the game for some :)
Shortest game was 4.5 h, longest (the first) some 10 hours.

RATING: 2
There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

I wasn't completely enamored with this state map. I felt as if some railroads had a much easier time of it while some were very difficult to get going. Not sure if it's a balance issue or just that it was my first play.

Works well with three players and it doesn't run as long as many 18xx games.  I suspect it could get nasty with 4 players though.

Great intro 18xx game, though I think it could have done without the 5-share/10-share "complexity".

RATING: 6
18xx: Basically players buy up controlling interests in railroad companies, develop them, and then decide whether to turn the profits into operating capital or dividends for shareholders. Player options and creativity, both in route-building and in stock manipulation are wide-open. The system is excellent, but I haven't played many versions.

18FL, set in Florida, is a fairly static version of the game, with a linear stock market and mostly linear track building. I thought it was an excellent introduction for learning the basic rules, but I could also see a lot more potential in the system that 18FL doesn't scratch. I'm scoring this version mostly for its value as a learners' game. Once learned, you'll be looking for better challenges pretty quickly.

RATING: 7.1
This is 18xx with a safety net.  It is a very good introductory game of the mechanics (laying track, buying stock, and so forth), but the beauty of 18xx is in the cutthroat takeovers, the brutal train race escalations, and the fights for locations.  This game doesn't really do that.  It is a nice look into history (comes with complete notes) about development of Florida though.

Plays best with 3 or 4, though it is one of the few 18xx games that also works with 2.

Played with 4-player once. It is a pretty good introductory 18xx that serves its purpose. Two different types of companies (5/10-stocks) and hotels makes the game different from what I have seen in 18xx. It seems that there are abundance of trains and game stales few times because there is not enough incentives to buy a train. Very mild and there are no change of presidencies at all.

What is the point of the partial capitalization? 

2 years later: I suppose I could have given this one more chances before I sold it.  After playing 18NEB I have begun to appreciate partial capitalization games.  If I get to play this again someday, I may revise my rating.

It has shorter playtime, very small map and supports less players (which can be a plus as it works well with few players or minus if you want to play with more) compared to some bigger 18xx games but it still feels like a full fledged 18xx.

Good for an intro to 18xx, but ideal with 3. Very unbalanced with 4.

RATING: 7
Terrific 18xx game. The play is well paced but with the usual collection of options and decisions to make. The 10 share / 5 share design works well to provide more early and interesting options to get companies up and running. Of particular note, the end game is much faster than the bank size at that point in the game would make you believe. While an income track is provided, this game suffers the same as all the rest in that the late game, where convoluted routes exist, causes a lot of retracing and recalculating of routes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Gentle. Key decisions seemed to be around converting from 5-share to 10-share companies, what to do with the Key West company that loses the route to Cuba late game, and how to collect dits (since they don't count against your stop total). The train rush…isn't, not if 4Ts are permanent. So "gentle" is the only word I can use to describe it. There really are a lot of 18xx designed to be a gentle intro to the genre, and I'm not sure one needs very many of them.

This is an okay game and was my first experience with 18xx. 

This one is a little bit more scripted than most. The tile laying isn't as interesting. 18GA and 18AL are better games for beginners but this one isn't bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great intro game to the 18xx system.  It boils down much of the game into something a bit more digestible.  That said, the 5/10 share bit was initially confusing.  This  makes for some fun decisions in the midgame, so it is worth the overhead.

I'm a little concerned about replayability as everything is so linear.  But, time will tell.

The only thing that I actively don't like is the bidding for the privates, random turn order can really hose someone.  It is an awkward bid that just isn't granular enough and too constrained for people to make worthwhile bids on them. This compounds the overpoweringly powerful the magic station private company.  So the first player gets it unless they don't bid $10.  The game may as well create new prices for the companies and just force the players to buy them in order.

Still, a minor complaint.  It is a solid game, and a nice take on the 1825 stock chart.

RATING: 7
Well, I don't know if this 18xx can be considered short (our three player ran about 5 hours) but man was this great! Being a newbie to the system, I really learned the basics of playing this game, considering the different rail lines builds, trains for transport and the stock market. I look forward to playing again and venturing into other 18xx titles in the future.

RATING: 7
OK.  Pretty thinned-down 18xx game.  The stock market is pretty stable in this one.  The hotels add an interesting twist, but also makes it harder to explain to new folks.  Good for a few plays, and good for new players.

A kinder gentler introduction to 18xx: trains stay around longer, may only sell 1 share at a time. Our game (3 newbies) took 6.4 hours! It should, however, play a lot more quickly.

I will pretty much play any 18xx game I can get into.  

Still, I don't think this will be one of my favorites.  It has many positives (the hotel / token decision is interesting) and I enjoyed playing it, but I think there are a number of other 18xx games that I would rather sit down to play.  

Also, the opening auction is unpleasant.  Why not just deal out the privates?

My one play didn't thrill me - the Cuba route appears to be way too powerful in the early game, and only the FEC can get it early.

A great learning 18FL with minimal complications but still has much to interest a seasoned player. The very strange auction for the initial privates is not to my taste. If the idea is to get the game started, why not just give them a fair price and let players pick in reverse order? Once you've played it, it seems reasonable to auction them off as normal. The mid-game share conversion is an interesting decision and a fantastic and forgiving way to get companies running early, and keep them running into the mid and end game.

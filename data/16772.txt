GAME: Mall of Horror
RANK: 1199
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based on 1 play with 6 players.  Everyone was keen to play and the theme is excellent and fun.  However the game seems to have quite a few 'bitty' rules which spoil the smooth fun somewhat.
In addition it seemed too long for what it was, and maybe due to the 6 players, the votes were usually determined on the basis of 'get the game leader', so there wasn't a great deal of room for strategy.
But I'd play again, maybe with less players and definately on halloween.

RATING: 10
This is one of my favorite games. I really love the way the game plays out. It is not about killing hoards of zombies, but rather about who is left by kicking other players to the hoard. Deep and perfect Zombie theme. I would really play this at any time (and do often).

I expected an Ameritrash style game, but it's actually a voting/screw your friends style of game with a bit of deduction and bluffing thrown in.

Overall, it's pretty neat, although I'm wondering if there isn't a very linear strategy involved (ie: he who controls the security cameras wins).

RATING: 7
Strange rules for a great game. Need 2 plays to catch the zombie feeling, and a correct group of people to catch the distressing survive feeling. Be agressive, be inflexible, be hitler, but don't let the tight spots of the game to go outside the boardgame.

The initial impression is good with this one.  Very cut throat, but I'm not sure if it'll have the staying power on the table.

After a second playing, I have a few concerns.  This one is VERY subjective to the group playing it.  With the wrong group of people this game takes a turn for the worse and becomes much like a long slow walk through waist deep snow at -30C.  Not fun.

Be aware.

RATING: 6
The rich thematic presentation of this game had me wanting to like it.  And there are some fun moments of desperate negotiation - and just plain desperation.  However, the voting system at the heart of it all just isn't interesting enough.  Usually it is pretty clear whose character will be eaten by the zombies; the one belonging to the player with more characters/more points left on the board.  Mall of Horror is a fun ride, but that doesn't quite disguise that it's a bit of a lottery.

RATING: 5.5
{3 plays • 5 & 6 player} I started out liking this one more, but additional play has really left me wanting.  The mechanics are fine - clever, even - and the theming is fantastic!... and everything feels right for the first half of the game, but once players start getting winnowed down, the options just aren't as fun - I felt like I wasn't so much struggling to survive as I was just watching the game play out.  Now, we didn't do a lot of negotiating and/or backstabbing - I could see where that might help - but, in a weird way, the game doesn't really foster it.  Which is too bad, 'cause again... nice mechanics, great theming.

I liked this as a ruthless negotiation game with a cool theme and interesting cards and character abilities.

RATING: 9
Probably the best zombie survival game out there. The perfect mix of collaboration and backstabbing, with just the right amount of "oh my, will the zombies break in and eat us alive now or next turn?" and most importantly, "who will we choose to feed to the zombies so that they will leave us alone?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2 plays on the first night out is always a good sign.  excellent theme, nice restriction of options, constant tension, healthy luck, and plenty of opportunity for negotiation.  i was fairly optimistic about the game and still had my expectations exceeded.  the rules could be way more clear, but clarifications are available in the forums.  solid game once you know the system.  Update: not happy about the strategy which involves intentionally ending up at the truck to hoard cards.  Thought City of Horror would be the next thing for me, but the previews I saw make it actually look too gamerific to me.  I like this as a gateway-type game.

RATING: 7
Great zombie fun.  If you like Lifeboats, check this game out.  I actually prefer this over Lifeboats because of the theme and the zombies.  Plus if you make a run out to the parking lot, it may be the last thing that you ever do, but on the other hand you may score some cool tools to beat the zombies; chainsaws, hand grenades, shotguns and more.

Do not play this with a pair of 9 year old twins.  They will clean your clock no matter how many people try to gang up on them.

With so much voting and player interaction this game is practically a party-game.  The art work and theme is pretty dark (so I guess it's more for adults) but I really like it.

Playing the game will remind a lot of people of the whole "survivor" reality TV craze...only this is a lot more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun theme (if you like zombies that is) with an interesting voting mechanic. Trouble is most of the time the voting is irrelevant as its a clear sweep for one player at that location. Controlling the parking lot is a key skill in this. Captures the relentlessness of zombie movies very well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good. I prefer Rette Sich Werr Kann (Lifeboats) since it's slightly more granular (you have ~6 people to lose, instead of three), & I think the card drawing aspect in MoH provides too much positive feedback, But it's still good.

Pretty fun and atmospheric negotiation game.
Players control three characters (gunman, screaming blonde, guy with a bat) and must move them inside a zombie-infested shopping mall.
When a location is overrun by zombies, players must vote which character must be thrown to the monsters to be eaten.
There's a funny mechanic of simultaneous movement and voting, together with the whole lot of classic zombie-fighting paraphernalia: shotguns, chainsaws, grenades, and so on.
I enjoyed it more than I care to admit.

A fun game with bluffing and political elements thrown in for good measure.  Running after the security chief each turn can be hilarious.

I think this game has a lot going for it.  Diplomacy/negotion/neighbor screwage/zombies/throwing your neighbor in front of the zombies/etc.  All sorts of fun.  Only complaint I have is that the end game seems to have a pretty strong (and unavoidable) kingmaker element.  But I still enjoy the game.

After 4 games:  It does seem that there are many times where the situation is such that one person will win the vote without any need for negotiation or betrayal.  Without those two elements, there's not much of a game here.  Lowered my rating to a 6 for now.

The most hatred-inducing game I've ever played. In Mall of Horror, screwing another player can often have less to do with tactics and everything to do with diplomacy (or lack thereof) or just feeding the player you least like at the moment to the awaiting zombie hordes. Most fun when players don't rush through the game, but take the time to discuss the story behind what's going on.

I dislike voting and negotiation games.  With this game in particular, you have very few pawns so there is not much room for strategy.  I agree with the observation of other BGGers that the security chief tends to stay the same for too much of the game.  ** It's a reimplementation of the Lifeboats game.  The zombie theme fits in some respects, but some mechanisms just don't fit the theme. **
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dead simple concept here - have more points left on the board than anyone else. You each (usually) have 3 counters worth 3,5,7 and you need to keep them alive. Everyone has to move a character between 6 locations each round. The locations have different susceptibility to zombie attack and enough Z's outside mean that someone is "voted out" to be eaten alive. You can draw cards from a location to help you survive and these soon run out!

There's plenty of chances to be mean to your opponents, vote them out to get them killed by zombies and so on, so it can get quite competitive and you can see that there's plenty of room for bluff and counter bluff about who moves where as manoevering round the board locations gives different advantages.

Holy smokes! I smell...........rotting flesh.

Maybe we should all baricade ourselves at the local shopping mall.  (Bring the models/bimbos too.)

This absurd little game is alot more fun than I thought it would be at first glance.  It's easily played and the zombies come to the various stores/sections in the mall every turn.  Rolling four dice determines where zomebies will wander too during each turn.  A security guard is privy too where they will show up, allowing him/her a slight advantage for that turn(this changes each turn based on who is able to land in the security headquarters).  The three people are worth various point values and once the population of characters falls to a certain level, the game ends with a "sudden death" mechanic and scoring is based on the value oif the various characters left.   Players pick from verious zombie fighting teams named such things as Men in Black, Homeboys, Rednecks etc.  (obviously not a serious game...)

If you haven't tried this game you should, its simply fun.

Good game that has a tactical side that's a nice edge to the game. A guessing game in a sense to what the other players will do.

A lot of laughs, and the game is more than who is the winner.

April 2011: I left feeling unsatisfied, and am unsure as to whether it is with the way we played, or whether the game itself just doesn't have a design that is conducive to intelligent negotiation (the werewolf vs resistance issue).

The votes all seemed pretty random and arbitrary, and the items weren't used very often or even collected that often.

I'll probably end up trading this one away while trade value is high and a reprint is not on the horizon, but would like to give it a final try with 6 players, which is touted as being a lot better than 5.    Initial rating a 6 (5 for gameplay, 7 for the theme and concept).

It's random, and it has zombies.  Should be a fun time, but it's not.  Analytical players spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure out the "best" move based on the board condition and knowing where the other players are moving to, which drags the game on way too long and sucks what little fun there is right out of the game.  And in the end that behavior is pointless because the huge random factors will determine who wins anyway.  No thanks.

Clever, flavorful, and doesn't go on too long. I found it more enjoyable than Rette Sich Wehr Kann, just because the atmosphere was so much better-done and more fun. But the game really needs as many players as possible, preferably 5 or 6. With 4, the voting doesn't mean a lot and the game is more or less purely tactical (it could be the same way at larger numbers too, but at least there is some chance for negotiation and/or witch-hunts).

Because it's mostly a screw-people-we-don't-like game, it's never going to be a personal favorite. But between the flavor and a little bit of tactics, there is enough there for me to be happy. But it's not a game I'd ever personally request.

Mehhhh. There are better zombie games and better negotiation games, leaving this one homeless.

Update: After not really caring for this game I had been sort of avoiding Lifeboats. Then I played Lifeboats. And while I see the similarities, I think Lifeboats is all around more streamlined, more tense and vicious, and a better pure "negotiation" game. I have a hard time seeing why this one is higher ranked.

This game has the potential to upset sensitive players, beware.  Lots of backstabbing. 
 
The components are great although it is a pity that the humans are represented with wooden discs instead of miniatures, as the zombies are.

The rule book is essentially gibberish, translated from French into... something else that isnt any language.  Get some of the rule summaries from BGG and the rulebook issues dissappear.  The rules are *very* simple anyway so dont let the rulebook put you off at all.

5 plays--a fine social game with increasing claustrophobic feeling. I like this better than Lifeboats. Betrayal and backstabbing fun--just like the zombie movies--the humans are worse than the zombies! Adds to the sense of theme. Maybe not best with six players due to time?

Nice idea to cash in on the zombie craze, but the game doesn't work. Nothing really happens and it gets boring very easily. Its another game where if one player gets a good start he's going to win most likely regardless.

Mall of Horror is a great game that is a bit situational. The theme is wonderful, and is well-integrated. The components are graphic and work well. The rules are enough to make the negotiation aspect interesting, without becoming needlessly complicated. It strikes the right balance there.

My first playing was with 4 players...and although it was enjoyable, it was more fun with 6. Eliminated players have to be good sports, or it can be a bit annoying.

The biggest downside is probably the player elimination. The rules (and variants) for allowing eliminated players to still vote and/or move a zombie are a nice try, but fall short of making a player still really feel involved. 

If played quickly enough, you shouldn't be sitting around waiting too long...but the potential is there. 

I look forward to playing this again. Of all the quirky Halloween themes, this one is my favorite. You can put your copy of Zombies in the trash once you get Mall of Horror. In fact, why wait?

I really enjoyed this game but I have one problem with it. One game we played two people joined up into a slight "team" which meant that it was impossible for anyone else to do anything, which was a major drawback of the game for me. But other games I have played I have enjoyed.

OK, first off I'm a huge George Romero fan and I consider the original Dawn of the Dead to be one of the Great Films of Our Time.  Second, I love nasty negotiating games that leave someone with hurt feelings.  Therefore, I think Mall of Horror is a real winner- a game that has a terrific theme that constantly relates its subject matter to the players through rules and mechanics that put atmosphere and the millieu first above balance or math.  Mall of Horror is a negotiating game that really has more to do with human nature than zombies anyway, and that being said I think it's one of the best.  The wheedling, politicking, and bribery that goes on is hilarious, pathetic, and constantly two-faced and as a result the game is a complete blast to play.  I do think that there could stand to be a little more "game" to it all but that being said there's more game here than in Intrige or the "Lifeboat" game.  I also think that there are a few rules that seem to be only partially implemented (the closure of the locations in particular) and ties are remarkably unsatisfying but that's all really beyond the point.  This is a terrific horror game that is more or less a sure bet with fans of the genre.    I also think the game has phenomenal graphics- it's clear that the graphic designers really understood and loved the subject matter and the result is a game that just looks spectacular and strikingly modern, like something that hip young people would play rather than something tired old men would play like El Grande.

This is Zombie Survivor. This game has a lot going for it. It has excellent graphics, nice quality components, quick game play with no real downtime, and lots of screwage to go around.

"Negotiation games" hold a special place in my heart, but probably only because of my adoration for the lifeboat game.  I bought this one thinking it would be more approachable for my "gamer buds" out there because of the cool theme, but it's not as good as the lifeboat game as far as gameplay goes.  Still, it's zombies and the artwork is very evocative, so what's to dislike too much?

Great fun for a group of cut-throat friends and always good for non-stop laughs. If the game is a reflection of how people would act in a real-world zombie apocalypse, you learn who your friends will be very quickly. I, as it appears, actually have no real friends.  MoH really captures the feel of some of the best of the zombie genre where the zombies aren't really the problem, but who you are locked up inside with is. Update 03/09 - Still a great game, but the fact that I haven't played this game in a year and moreso that I haven't had the desire to do so has caused me to lower the rating. Update 6/09 - Might sound wishy-washy, but I got in two unexpected plays - still a hit with me!

Este es de los llamados "juegos para hacer amigos". Tienes que mover a tus supervivientes entre los distintos departamentos del supermercado y si entran en alguna estancia se vota a quién se comen.

RATING: 7
Not hard to learn, but it takes a while before you master the art of screwing your friends over in this one.  That's the point of the game, basically throwing your friends under the bus (or in front of the zombie hoards).  Once the rules are down, the games go quickly.  I need to play it more with the right group.  Had a bad experience trying to play this with my non-gamer friends.  That was worse than being eaten by the zombies.  Argh!

6 = Thumbs Up. One of those "fun with the right group" games. Theme is fantastic, and there's plenty of opportunities for role-playing. Biggest flaw is that the players mathematically eliminated from contention - and this can happen early on - are basically reduced to spectators.

Not a bad game in the right circumstance.  I usually like something deeper, but this game is easy to learn and plays pretty quickly.  Scramble to stay alive by putting the other players' pieces in the way to be eaten by zombies.  I enjoy the tension involved when finding out where the zombies will appear each turn.  Will my pawn get eaten?  Or will another player's pawn fall victim instead?  Comical in that the female pieces attract more zombies because they "scream".  A little strategy involved, but some luck as well.  Negatives are that it has player elimination, but most games don't last too long anyway.  This would make a nice fit to my collection as that Zombie game, and one where it can handle a larger group of non-serious gamers who aren't willing to tackle a Martin Wallace game.  ;)

I usually pull this one out when I have non-games over to play some games.  I find that them theme is something they can get into, and any advantage I have from being an experienced player is negated by the political nature of the game.  I am usually the first on eliminated, then I can just facilitate the game for the others.

Hugely thematic, beautifully produced game with some real tactical play layered on the negotiation, backstabbing and whining of a "vote 'em off the island" game.

Like in Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later, where the characters flee the zombies, barricade doors against them, make heroic sacrifices, and clamor to survive by any means necessary, Mall of Horror is a tense, engrossing and immersive experience.

There are no other Zombie games.

A mildly amusing game, but not one of my favorites.   I've never liked games with a "traitor" aspect, such as Battlestar Galactica or Shadows over Camelot, and while there really isn't a traitor per se, but actually more of a "who you gonna toss under the bus", it has the same feel.  Plus, I'm pretty much over the whole zombie thing.  I'll play it for the sake of the group, but I will never suggest it.

For all fans of Zombie films this is a great game, others might be put off by a luck - and betrayal-dominated game. But for sheer atmosphere and fun this is the best Zombie game out there, and the components are fantastic. The rules are simple and can be quickly taught, and you really care for your characters to survive. In addition this is not a simple game to "beat" - one actually has to put some thought into each and every move, although many factors will decide on the outcome of a turn. Great fun - I'd recommend it!

A fun light-hearted romp, in spite of (because of?) the theme... Played a bunch of times with five.  The players don't have alot of control over what's going on, but the short duration keeps it fresh.

One negative is that most votes are a foregone conclusion which makes it less of a negotiating game and more of a guessing game.

I'm sure this will be one we'll trot out during future Halloweens.

RATING: 5
Another game where I learn that I actually don't like negotiation games.  The idea of voting to feed people to the zombies just didn't play out as "crazy fun" as I expected. In games like this, the meta-game takes over and people will vote other people out for reasons outside the game (in my case, because I had won the previous game we played). Or maybe that is the game. 

The security chief is a great idea, but seemed to be a bit overpowered. Too bad the other places don't offer some type of advantage (other than the parking lot, of course).  Think that would give it a bit more balance.

Cool theme.  There was actually less screwing people over than I though there would be.  In things like Quo Vadis? or Intrigue, the backstabbing was way more evident.

First play--3 players--fun, but with 3 seems very tactical and less negotiation is needed.  Probably needs 4-6 to shine.  Still, very enjoyable, great theme.


EDIT:  After playing with 3, 5, and 6, I think that 6 is too many, five is almost there...so I'm guessing four is the "sweet spot".  With 6 there just isn't any control at all, and you have too few things to offer to do any sort of true diplomacy.  All you can offer are future votes and cards from truck searches.

Best played quickly I think, I mean really, there are zombies just outside and to them you look like a supersized Krustyburger combo meal.  Probably the more the merrier for this game.

Zombies in a mall and they're trying to eat you. Vote who gets thrown to the undead while you run away.
Awesome!
Only downside is that the designers in typical french manner have chosen to make a beautiful game rather than understandable, so the first time you play with people you may have to explain all the cards a few times.

RATING: 8
Although some folks balk at the theme, this has turned out to be a really enjoyable family game around here. The kids picked it up easy due to the superficial similarity to Pirate's Cove (the voting wheels, location-by-location actions, etc.), and everyone had fun trying not to get eaten.

It did seem to drag a little once there were only a few player's bits left on the board. As locations get over-run and condemned, the dice-roll to place zombies fails to place zombies more and more, which is where the slowdown comes from. But it still is inevitably over within a few rounds, since the truck supplies are finite.

Update (Dec 2013): Finally got to play this with a full compliment of six players, and the issue with the end game doesn't exist with more players. It tends to end abruptly (last time when four zombies showed up in the parking lot and ate all four survivors present ending the game) and there are a lot more chances to beg, plead, coerce, etc.

Asmodee really should reprint this one, it's nine years old and still fun.

Reminds me strongly of Game "Lifeboats". There are slight differences between those games and Mall of Horror is a bit more complex. I prefer Mall over Lifeboats because of the "look and feel". A game like this needs to be more "Ameritrash" than "Eurogame" like Lifeboats is. The more players the better as there is no significant downtime.

No desire to own it, but a zombie filled Lifeboat Game in a mall was my last  game at BGG.con '06 and it was a great way to end things.  It has great theme and a mechanism that conveys the suffocating nature of being trapped with an ever increasing number of zombies.  Some strange aspects, 'voting for' someone means to kill them in some situations, and to save them in other situations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Some aspects of this gore fest prevent me from giving an unqualified endorsement.  It can become repetitive, lacks strategic depth or a variety of tactical options and the winner is often determined by kingmakers rather than by any canny manoeuvring on your part. However, despite these weaknesses, this one has been a winner with my geeks every time.  Great with 5 or 6.  Plays in an hour. Negotiate, back stab, and watch, with delight, the horror on your opponents faces as they realise they have become the main dish at the zombie chow down. A satisfying plateful!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Good theme and easy to learn. Game includes mild suspense, strategy and ploting against other players. Components are ok. All-in-all, a fun game for a few plays, but becomes repetitive quickly. Players with characters that huddle around the truck at the beginning of play tend to have a large advantage. The game dynamics change for the better with more players. I would suggest playing with 5 or 6 people if possible. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is actually a fairly abstract game with a theme tacked on pretty effectively.  The whole game is about anticipating the other players' moves, which is a mechanic I normally like.  There wasn't enough to do in the game to keep me terribly interested, but there's definite strategy involved, and not an overpowering amount of luck.  It reminds me a lot of a streamlined and more abstract Pirate's Cove.

RATING: 6
Combine Werewolf with Zombies! and you have Mall of Horror. There's more to it, of course, but that about sums it up. If you like negotiation and voting games, this if for you. If you don't like the idea of voting someone out to save your own skin, you might want to stay away. Great fun for the right crowd. UPDATE: Reduced rating a bit because the game can tend to drag on too long. Important to keep things moving.

A very faithful transposition of the G.R. Romero´s movies recurrent idea: "we humans are threatened by a horde of zombies, but instead of uniting against them, let´s fight each other and accelerate our downfall".

Can become a little repetitive after some games, but it is cleverly done, and fun (and sometimes tense between the players, since the basic idea is to screw your opponents, and vote -and thus sometimes gang up- against one or another).

Nice art.

This is certainly a quick way to scratch that itching zombie urge of yours. The rules are simple and the gameplay hectic. 
However, I think the rules could have done with some more polish:
- The voting ends up in obvious deadlocks too often. 
- At the end of the game there are too few choices to be made and often you can toss a coin to make your selection.
- The various locations are too similar.

The appeal of this game comes from its excellent theme and player interaction. 

It's amazing how the simple ruleset recreates the theme of Romero's zombie movies. Your fellow survivors are as deadly (and often more deadly) than the zombie horde.

Repeated plays, however, indicate that the game can be drawn out interminably by players who aren't viscious enough.

The early game is rather pointless unless you can swarm the security room (which itself is determined randomly), but once the zombies start attacking things get great real quick. The problem is that zombie attacks are decided rather randomly, so things can stall--which is a very bad thing.

Great components, very well themed.  Game is a light negotiation game with some tactical play mixed in.  Its pretty original, plays fast and has high non-gamer appeal.  The bluffing element is neat and the theme is very well-integrated into the cards and the different locations on the board.  It also plays well with 6 players.  

I wish this would get reprinted - maybe with a theme link to one of the many popular zombie franchises out there.

Incredibly simple gameplay, but still sooooo hard to master!
Each player controls one gang of 3 or four characters, each one with one of thre different abilities. The goal is to survive in a zombie-infested mall until the rescue helicopter arrives.

You have to use wits, lies and bribes to lure the other players into the arms of the zombies before they do the same to you!
Cooperate with your enemies to survive, but make sure their characters are voted for zombie lunch before they pick you....

Zombies are on the loose, and your team is holed up in one of the mall stores. As you move around, there are times when too many characters go to the same store, and the store can't hold everyone, so a character gets tossed out to appease the zombies. Neat idea, but need the right group.

Played once at a friend's place against a bunch of strangers. I won by being the most quiet and unassuming (which I usually am, in a room full of extroverts ;) 

Interesting game concept, trying to keep alive as many of your characters as possible while avoiding zombies and your traitorous friends. I really don't like the voting mechanism as it can lead to players getting "picked on" and I think in my other game groups, people's feelings get hurt a bit when that happens too much so this game would tank with them.

A back-stabbing/negotiation game of who-gets-thrown out of the boat first with zombies? I'm in.

1st played 11/13/07. Taught in ~10min & played 1 hr w/ 6 players. Good luck/strategy mix. Mall has 6 locations(max pawns): 1-restroom(3), 2-Cachou(4), 3-Megatoys(4), 4-Parking lot(PL; no max), 5-Security HQ(3), 6-Supermarket(6). Each person has 3 pawns: 3-gunman(gets 2 votes), 5-bully(repels 2 zombies ZB) & 7-girl. Player pawns start @ a location from 2 dice roll. (1 @ a time; 3 rounds). Security chief election occurs between players @ HQ w/ voting wheels. Players may promise to show dice, etc for votes. Chief rolls dice, peeks @ ZBs destination & moves 1 of his pawns to a new location followed by all players going left. ZB locations are revealed & placed. If a girl majority exist(no tie), a ZB is also placed there. If ZBs outnumber pawns then elections occur (w/ wheel) for an eaten pawn (all ZBs removed from that location; if empty as well*). PL has no defense so elections always occur. Repeat rounds until someone is eliminated. Total pawns #'s for victor. Special action cards (AC) are also rewarded to majority leader in PL. AC: Hidden(eaten exclusion; can make location empty*), various kill cards(1-2 ZB), Security cameras(see chief roll), hardware, threat, sprint(move pawn). Recommend gameplay & purchase consideration.

Mall of Horror is a halfway done game in my opinion with the design just carrying it so far before it implodes.  The beginning and mid-game are great and the mechanics tight.  I felt as though I always had a viable strategy and that with shakey alliances any advantage by others could be toppled.  However, the end game absolutely killed what it had going for it.  The game slowed to a halt and got downright retarded in the last few turns as "kingmaking" proved to be the clear final turn theme.  I always hate to play games like these.  They're so good and then BOOM! -nothing.  That under-designed taste is a foul one.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (April 2011)

I love Zombie games and I spent a long time trying to get my hands on this one. Finally I bought it (albeit it was very expensive) so MAYBE (just maybe) I’m a little biased :P. But I really love this game. As of today it is my favorite zombie game. I recommend that you play it with the full complement of players (6). 

The theme is superb, as opposed to most zombie games, the idea in not to kill zombies but merely to survive them, how you may ask? Well with lots and lots of negotiation and betrayal of course.... after all SURVIVAL IS IN THE BETRAYAL.

The components are outstanding.

On the bad side you have to play it with people who won´t carry a grudge because often you will feel (and it is true I know it is :P) that everyone is out to get you killed and some people are just not built to withstand such aggravations (I have seen couples fight over this game).  Also it would be nice to have some text on the cards.

I just raised the rating as I found out I have been playing it with a wrong rule, with the correct set of rules this is a 9.5 to me even though I have been (thus far) unable to win it.

Lots of fun in this game, near my top ten of all time.

Current Rating: 9.5

I still Love Mall of Horror, however I have now played more than 500 games so now I feel I have more tools to properly asses the game. I´m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG recommendation system, it is still a great game in my book, however I don’t want to play it every week, so it is now a 7.5.

I prefer to play this game over its current incarnation City of Horror.

A friend painted the minis making the game look even better.

I still have fond memories of the game and it still has a prized place in my game collection, however, nowadays I enjoy less and less the betrayal aspect of games in general so I enjoy Mall of Horror a bit less.

Still one of the best Zombie games out there and I don’t think I will ever sell it.

This is a light, atmospheric game in which the goal is to be the last person standing after all of your opponents' characters have been eaten by Zombies. You each have the same set of three characters: Bat, Gun, and Screamer. At the heart of the game, you're moving simultaneously between a few areas of the mall. You choose secretly, with two goals: first, you want majority "vote" in the new location, and second, you don't want to be locked out of the location because it's already full. Whenever the zombies break into a location, the players there vote and throw someone to their death in order to escape themselves. While all of this is going on, there is another layer to the game as players battle over control of the parking lot and keep and eye on the security chief. The player who controls the parking lot receives useful equipment (single-use). The player who controls the security cameras knows which areas the zombies will attack next. When these players get too much of an advantage, the votes usually go against them... unless they've been feeding you equipment!

Another very fun themed game that is make or break on who you play with.  My low rating is primarily based on the many games I have played where the theme did not transcend on the players and we just meandered around the mall hoping we didn't get eaten.  

However, with the right setting/people this game is easily an 8.  It's a blast pleading your case as to why you shouldn't be eaten, prommissing things later in the game you can't deliver, and trying to maintain good standing with the right peoplem, it's a riot.  Sadly this experience is a rare occurrence for me.

Social engineering, Lifeboat-style.  But with zombies.  A good title if you like player negotiation, and those "vote-'em-off-the-island" moments.

RATING: 4
Disappointed by this one.  I don't particularly care for zombie themes at all - why are they so popular?  But I like these types of negotiation games where you can form alliances and backstab the other players.  But something didn't seem right.  There was little incentive to betray your opponents and very little negotiation that could be done.  Being very similar to (I would say inspired by) Lifeboats it has the exact same kingmaking problem at the end too.

I find this game hard to rate, as this is one of the games where WHO you play it with really makes the difference, more so than with many other games I have played and/or own... with the right crowd it´s a hoot! Although playable, it doesn´t feel right with just 3 players.

RATING: 6
So-so zombie/voting game. It does borrow off Rette Sich Wer Kahn, but with some added mechanisms on top. It actually got quite boring with 6 players, especially since the "Security Chief" part can slow down a bit (since that player is the only one with any information). Other than that, I thought the weapons were too easy to obtain but it was a nice touch to the game.

Not some silly humans versus zombies or a zombie body count game, MoH gets it right with the sense of growing and inevitable doom.  Game components are solid and I love the thematic artwork.  Game play is tight.  I very much wanted to like this game.  Unfortunately the game is too abstract and anticlimactic.  “Survival is in the Betrayal” may be the catch phrase on the box and, if true, this could be a good game.  However, the game mechanisms actively reward team play (read meta-gaming).  In practice the leading player group will monopolize the resources, while the other players mark time until they are mercifully eliminated from the game.  As I write this comment (09.26.09) the only MoH strategy article aptly describes the situation.

Just not enough game here.
Plus the game loses a full point for CLAIMING to be Monroeville Mall, when it most obviously is not.  (The mall where the original Dawn of the Dead movie was shot)  I should know, I live 20 minutes away from the real deal.

It looses another point for the "eldest" player always starting as the security officer, I have camped in the security office for 3 straight wins, once doing so without losing a single character.  An advantage that greatly irked my entire group, but was fully exploitable by the rules.

This is a lot of dark-humor fun.  When I first heard it had a "voting" mechanic, I almost puked.  However, it really, really works for this game.  I can't believe how well.

Mall of Horror is one of those games that is loaded with theme: components and mechanisms blend perfectly to immerse you in this negotiation game. That makes this a fun game to play, but it has it's drawbacks. Namely, voting outcomes tend to be obvious, which makes the voting itself feel scripted.

It is an excellent game to play with non-gamers friends. Fun, quick decisions, rapid and bloody negotiations, outstanding emotions. This game reveals people nature. :-) Rules are very simple and complementing each other. The game climate is outstanding.

But... It has several drawbacks, that makes it, I assume, poorly ranked in BGG. The game is very random, you can lose in first few rounds without making anything wrong. It is also extremely vulnerable to hard alliances from out-of-the-game relations (like playing couples). It isn't absolutely the game which you win if you played the best.

These drawbacks makes this game suitable only for right people with right attitiude. But with them, the game is extraordinary.

At one time I owned Mall of Horror but after a few plays it really didn't keep my attention so I traded it away, but after playing [gameid=120217] I realized how much I had missed playing the original. Much like it's namesake in the series of movies this game is definitely the best of the bunch. Its rules are streamlined for maximum affect, and the game plays fast and fun. The rules are extremely easy to grasp and teach, and the game moves along at a good pace. The only caveat I would say is that it requires a group that is willing to negotiate and table talk, that is where this game really shines. Almost everything in the game can be negotiated. The mechanics of the game are built around the idea that you need to form temporary alliances, and sometimes break them to survive. If you aren't first, you will be last. I also enjoy the rules for eliminated players as this is where grudges can be exercised after being eliminated. I am really glad I was able to pick up another copy of this after so many years.

This is an interesting game that combines area influence with voting and negotiation.  Having played it with both a 3 player group and a 6 player group on several occasions, I can now say that it plays MUCH better with a larger crowd.

This game combines some of the movement finesse of Dungeon Twister with random chance and social engineering like Diplomacy.  It is much more luck based than Dungeon Twister (which arguably has no luck) but I like the three front war in the game (positioning, reacting to adversity, negotiation) as a light mix.

Mall of Horror is a silly game, and it knows it. It's basically a combination of double guessing, voting, and some partnerships that works well with the post apocalyptic zombie theme, but doesn't have the backstabby feel of a lot of partnership games such as Dead Last. Personally I prefer this level of nonbackstabbiness. My play was a nice palate cleanser but was much shorter than the stated length. If it is normally as fast as my experience I would probably bump this game up a rating, but it would overstay its welcome at an hour.

From the box i thought it would be a fighting zombie game but it turns out to be a bluffing/voting game.
I like the theme, but i don''t feel the sense of fighting zombies. We are always overrun and eaten by them (and this is the point of the game). The game ends quite suddenly and caught us by surprise.

I think it is an alright party game, one that would only come out once in a while

Needs the right group to be fun, and the more people playing the better.

It's just "outdated" IMHO.

I had high hopes for the game and I am a bit dissapointed - the voting system doesn't work perfectly. You would need players that are really keen on winning the game, in any other case strong alliances form, and that's a bit against the idea of the game. Great looks though and it's still fun. Download the rules summary, though. The english rules aren't very well written.

One play. Meatier than Ca$h and Gun$ though that may not necessarily be a good thing after more plays. Lots of backstabbing, negotiating and zombie goodness. We had a couple of rules wrong the first time but overall I enjoyed it and can see it being even more enjoyable next time I play. 


Second play. Correct rules this time. Still felt a tad bit longer than it should have been but still good times overall. I would like to try Lifeboats to see how they compare.

This game is best when played with lots of people. Mall of horror does have  some strategical choice. But at its heart its more of a bluff/diplomatic game. The artwork is a .  And the zombie theme add to the game perfectly.

Fine game. As they say: "dripping with theme." As much as I enjoy zombie movies (28 days, Omega Man, Shaun of the Dead, etc.) I just don't take to this theme in a game.

This is a nice light negotiation game that take about an hour to play. not nearly as nasty as lifeboats, but still catches some of the same "someone has to get the shaft" feel.

RATING: 6
Each turn one of your 3 surviving characters (one's a thug who can keep off 2 zombies at a time, one has a gun who get's 2 votes, one is a woman who's special power is attracting zombies) must choose a location at the mall to run to (via simultaneous selection).  Four dice are rolled determining where new zombies will arrive.  The location with the most characters draws an extra zombie, so does the location with the most women.  Each location has a limit of people it can hold and eventually the zombies will over-power them.  The players in the room will have to vote in order to decide which character to throw-out & sate those zombies appetite for the time-being.  Eventually stores will become over-run with zombies and close down (thus narraowing the possible locations to run to).  As people get eaten & locations become limited the zombies become more difficult to keep back, it's a losing battle. 2 special areas: one has security cameras and whoever in that room wins the vote to be the security officer gets to see where the zombies will move to next.  That person "can" share the info with others if s/he chooses.  There's also the parking lot where the winner of that vote takes 3 special items, takes one, discards one & gives the other to another in that room.  The parking lot has no walls so when a zombie shows up there one person will be eaten.  When players are on the run and have chosen a room that's at full capacity they'll get bumped to the parking lot.  The marriage of zombies with the negotiation mechanic was quite a fun suprise.  Even though negotiations are non-binding (votes decide everything) & it's done well, I'm not a huge fan of the mechanic;  you may be.  The only thing I can promise is there will be a lot of carnage.

A good addition to the 6-player games category.  I think it's hard to build up your 6-p library - so many games that are good with six are just party games (which isn't bad - I like party games! - but it's not always what I want).  It's got a fun little screw-your-neighbor bit to it that brings some good-natured negotiations and threats.  Not as divisive as some such games can get, making it a good choice for those who like such games but want to go home still friends with those who played.

Doesn't feel balanced.  Also feels vary random.  Security room seems to be the focal point of the whole game.  There isn't anything to negotiate with, so it becomes random.

An okay game, but not one I'd want to play too often.

It's hard luck for anyone who get knocked out early - placing a single extra zombie once a turn is not the most exciting activity one can imagine.

Very very good game.  Played it with a full compliment of 6 players and was a superb easter (in a perverse way) social game of screwing your mates over.  Lasted 2 hours of undead fun and action.  Went right down to the wire where the final brains eating vote went to who would win.Blond cop chicks win all the time!!

Actually, a very good game beyond the theme. It has political (voting), some negotiation and "area control" components. Not as bloody, but has all the necessary elements of a good Zombie game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is brilliant, maybe one of the longest enduring  Zombie games I've played!

Players secret move and vote for who gets supplies and who gets eaten when the Zombies bust in!

Great screwage/high strategy makes it both fun and entertaining. There's some diplomacy in here too depending upon the negotiation skills of the group. Watch out though! Depending upon you group you can also expect hurt feelings and betrayed friendships! This one isn't a bonding experience!

Definitely plays best with 6 players though- almost all locations start off full, which makes destination-choosing much more difficult.

Also popular with newbies, as its not over complex once you get your head around the voting system.

Most the game design is truly great and captures the essence of what zombie settings are about, as in things going worse and human selfishness being the main antagonist. Unfortunately occupation of the parking lot by a player (or - more often at higher player counts - an alliance of players agreeing to split the benefits of the truck loot) is devastating for the chances of everybody else and clearly broken from a game development perspective.

The overall production of the game is fantastic, right down to the full-color rule booklet, but would someone PLEASE tell me why Asmodee didn't send their "translated" rules to someone who normally speaks English for a bit of proofreading and editing?  There's really no excuse for poorly translated rule books anymore, especially when you have an enthusiastic group of gamers out here who are more than willing to do the work for little more than a free copy of the published product (or nothing at all)!  Inexcusable.

There's some potential for fun negotiations between people on the voting side, but I found this didn't really do much for me overall. I think the lack of interaction and actual fighting with the zombies is probably the biggest disappointment. Plus I find the idea that you have to move every turn really odd as why would I abandon somewhere safe for no good reason, especially if it's the security office?

Wow.  Fantastic tie-in with theme and mechanics, tight gameplay... but the final round could not suck louder.  It begs for kingmaker scenarios where the last-place person MUST decide who wins.

After multiple playings, the kingmaker aspect has toned down a bit.  It's still there, but the fact that one must play in accordance to it gives it a 1st Season Survivor feel.  I'm liking it more and more.

This is one of the only games I've ever played and never want to try again.

The gameplay is chaotic at best and downright boring when at it's worst. Coupled with the fact that there are SO many votes going on that I completely lost interest half-way through the game.

While the caricature of zombie movies is probably trying to make fun of movie stereotypes I just found the game offensive, that the woman's ability is to scream and attract zombies. Call me self-righteous, but it just wasn't fun in this game.

This is a brilliant game. If you love a game of backstabbing, constant threat of betrayal and extreme player interaction, then this is for you! The system works great! Players openly discuss alliances above the table and secretly below it all at the same time (avoid glass table!). The "weakest link" victim select system is great! The whole game is about speaking and negotiating your way through survival. If you are the player with the least advantage, then that's your advantage! Other players don't see you as a threat so you can actually be decisive in a leading player vote clash, and this might just negotiate your way back to a healthy couple of cards that might be the hidden card, some zombie-slaying weapon or any other of the extremely useful but very limited cards! All just fits great, I usually am not much into theme based games and rather pay attention to the game mechanics, but this one... just has it all!!

Minor quibbles over card design (the faux Polaroids are awesome, but don't bear any text reminding newbs what they do) pawn labels (it would have been nice if they could have been clearer/more distinct/designed to be read from further away) and dice quality (the yellow paint pops right out of the pips on the black dice, making them very hard to read) can't defeat the overall awesomeness of the design and mechanics of this very fun, nasty relative of Lifeboats.

In both games I played, the person who was starting security officer was able to put two characters in the security office and have the third move into the parking lot whenever it was safe to pick up cards. The two characters in the security office made sure he was never ousted, and his stash of cards protected the third. Both times, the security officer never lost a single character and ended up with a ton of cards to spare. Two different players came up with this strategy, one never played the game before. Most decisions seem random or trivial. Great atmosphere can't save this for me.

Nothing complex here, just run for your life and try not to make too many enemies. Some simple decisions to make, but the biggest variable is what the others will do and what they know that you do not. Plays nicely and simple to learn with a lot of interaction.

Do NOT play this with just 3 or 4 players.  This is a lot like the Lifeboat game, but shorter, less repetitive, more variety.  I love voting/negotiation, but you have nothing to bargain with except future promises, so this makes for some ganging up and kingmaking.

Zombies mmmmm

Like the turn mechanic as the characters have to move from one bolthole to another. Early in the turn order you may not have a place open and have to go to a less desirable location. Later and your open spot may not be there. 

That is one place for negotiations, to make sure you have a place to go, also who gets stuff from the Parking lot, then finally who gets to be the tasty morsel. 

Like the bits for the zombies and the cards remind of the B grade horror films even down the gratuitous panty shot on the sprint card.

The game is far from being as vicious as I thought and it is not as much about the voting but anticipating your opponents moves and making sure the Zombies do not get you. Most of the voting in game could only go only so many ways and as such the strategic / alliance options were limited anyway. As such, I did not enjoy the game as much as I though I would and I am not very keen on the artwork which seemed a bit random and generic, would have prepared something darker and more stylized. I think the theme does not work very well, I never felt the creeping onslaught of undead like I do in Last Night on Earth for example. Not a bad game, but at its core, it is a simple placement game and more about calculation than anything else.

An interesting game that is very similar to Rette Sich Wer Kann (the Lifeboat game).  If I didn't already own that game I would probably buy this one.  The graphic design is probably the best I have ever seen in a game.  The gameplay does seem to have some problems.  Each player only has 3 tokens, so the voting is often obvious and endgame ties seem extremely likely.  Still, as a whole it's a well done package.

I like Lifeboats, but it's pure negotiation: you're always at the mercy of the other players. If they want to vote you out, you have two shots with your captain, but after that, there's nothing you can do. Mall of Horror adds some random and hidden factors to the mix, and that improves the design for me.

We had a blast with 6 people, but I have been warned that it is much less fun with any fewer.  Similar enough to "Rette Sich Wer Kann" ("Lifeboat") that I see no reason to own both, although the zombie theme is happily very strong in MoH.  We had a lot of fun trash-talking and generally thrashing each other.  Rated "6" because I see only a sporadic desire for replays in the future.

The mechanics (voting) don't match up with the game at all. If you don't play it the nasty way it becomes a really lame cooperative game (as everyone knows where the Zombies will be). On top of that, the winner will be just a matter of luck, because you don't have the means to eliminate the other players, besides happening to be at the right place at the right time, by sheer luck...
The production value is really high, but the game is a bore...

Played once. I thought this game was rather fun, even though I came in 4th or 5th place out of 6. It [i]is[/i] a game in which players can be totally out of, and have to either sit around and wait, or go join another game. But I dont think the game is long enough to really make this a problem. One person can watch and wait for another to drop, then those 2 can play LotR:tC or Blue Moon or something. I think with 6 noobs we played in about an hour, maybe a little more. Can't be too sure as I was having too much fun. Seems like its pretty powerfull to be in the Parking Lot at the beginning of the game and get cards (hopefully.) I really like the theme, which is obviously ripped off from Dawn of the Dead, but thats a good thing. I would definently play again, especially now that I have a handle on what's going on.

After viewing the [url=http://www.mevio.com/shows/?sId=15871&mId=2963702][i]Obsessed with Gaming[/i]'s video of this game[/url] I though that there was too much chaos on it for me to like it.  Nevertheless, we tried it in our group to celebrate [i]Halloween Month[/i] and it showed as a light, exciting, fun and quick filler; one to give it a play from time to time.

This was actually quite a bit of fun. The theme is well-integrated, the ideas are cool, and it was fun negotiating with people, knowing that eventually one of you had to die. It went on too long--and oddly enough, it actually slowed down as we neared the end, rather than speeding up. That seemed odd. It won't get higher than a 7 for me simply because it's a player elimination game, and it can go on too long. But it's still a good zombie game...better than that crappy one with 82 expansions.

Excellently themed voting / negotiation game. The use of voting to determine who gets killed in a zombie apocalypse brings out the absolute worst in people, which is even better for the theme. I like it, but it's a mean, nasty game, and I don't often play with people who respond well to nasty games. I also have a bias against negotiation games, which can really bog down in the wrong group.

Could have really done with some nicer components to further the theme. Especially to differentiate among the player colors.

[1 play] 6 players. Mall of Horror was pretty much what I expected. A party game guys don't feel too silly playing. It is meant to be a fun experience for a dynamic group, and I think that's exactly what we got out of it. No deep strategic masterpiece by any stretch, just a fun theme around which to enjoy the threats and negotiations of throwing each other to the wolves. I don't think it has strong long term replayability within a static group of people, but I'm glad I traded for it. 

Most recent play 9-27-06 with Alex, Brian, Corey, Garrett, and Michael.

RATING: 7
My favorite zombie game, and one of my favorite board games in general. With the right players, people with social skills and devious minds, this is a fantastic game of negotiation and manipulation. The components are wonderful, and the box is cunningly designed to hold the components well. The rule book has slightly peculiar wording, due to an odd translation from the original french, and the cards would have been improved with a little more text. A turn sequence summary card would have been helpful.

11/12/07: I have upgraded my rating after playing 50  games. The depth of the gameplay completely transcends the awkward wording of the rulebook. The theme is executed well, and the game is challenging all the way to the tense conclusion. The social aspect of the game is important but not decisive, and neither the parking lot strategy nor the security chief strategy are reliable enough to dominate the game.

The rules summary sheets that I downloaded from here at BGG are great for new players.

Well, yeah, there isn't a whole lot of difference between the mechanics of this and  Rette Sich Wer Kann, but there is enough differences to justify owning both.

This is the only zombie game that I need.

I'm not a fan of zombies and horror movies, and yet, I found this to be pretty decent. At its core, it's a deduction and guess-what-your-opponent is doing type of game, which makes it a fun social game. The main challenge is figuring out where you can go next and what might be a safe location, as well as negotiating or bullying your way for a couple of cards to be able to survive a bit longer. While not something I'd want to play all the time, I was pleasantly surprised by this title.

Last Night On Earth warrants a bunch more plays and may usurp the title!

I'm not much for zombie games, though I can overlook that if the game is still fun.  Here the decisions aren't compelling and there's also a significant kingmaking problem.  I'm not even a fan of going to the mall, though I do enjoy it more than I used to.

This is one of those games which almost every review I've read (and my sampling includes clicking reviews which are bland) says "This game really surprised me with how good it was, so I give it 7/10".  A "C minus" doesn't begin to speak justice for this game.  I've never won, and yet I'm always rabid for another play.  It's just so 'zombie' in a way LNoE isn't, I feel it isn't given a fair shake because it lacks 10 different decks of cards and a leveling character system.

First zombie game I've played that really captures the feel of desperation, survival, and nihilism.  Plus, it's essentially democratic!  Yaay for social studies!

[2 plays] My gaming group seems to enjoy this one a lot more than I do.  I dislike games where you vote for your favorite player.  I dislike games with high randomness.  This game has both of these features.  I get it that it is a fast light-hearted game and it does work well enough for what it is.  I'll probably end up playing this game more but I will never suggest it and might even attempt to propose other light games as an alternative.

As far as games go, this one's not horrible but it's not all that great either.  The game revolves around a simultaneous selection mechanic (which location do I want to go to) with a lot of voting.  Players vote for who gets eaten, who gets stuff, who gets special privileges and so on.  As a result, it's really all about making deals and building cartels.  The game suffers from a runaway leader problem but it's short enough to not be a huge problem.
I suppose I might like it more if I didn't find the theme so stupid.  Zombies really don't do anything for me.

I think your players really effect how good a game it is however.  That being said it's an interesting psudo-board/party game.  The voting, betrayal and trickery are all fantastic in this and play well with the theme.  My major issues lie with production quality and a really awful rulebook.  Poor English translation, over explanation to the point of stupidity help to over complicate a relatively simple little game of survival.

RATING: 9.5
I love zombies.  

There are quite a few godd zombie games and re-themes (Zombinion is an awesome Dominion re-theme) and I have played a number of them.

I think Dead of Night has all of the details of a good zombie movie, huge crowds of zombies, making molotovs and throwing them into the crowd of zombies, finding an old van in a shed, then searching rooms for the keys and some gas and on and on.  I like the game a lot, but while it is open enough to allow for betrayal, making threats and negotiating for your life it doesn't force it at all and people just don't seem to do it.

Mall of Horror does force this action.  In fact, that is what the game is built around.

While other zombie games might have the details of zombie survival right, they don't feel as authentic (yes, I know zombies aren't real...yet) those games don't have the politics of survival in the way this one does. 

Also, one does not have to be a zombie fan to enjoy this.  The three people my wife I play with most often don't have any interest in zombies or horror.

Mall of Horror gets my nod for "King of Zombie Games." 

So, that's my opinion of it as a zombie game. Now what do I think of it as a negotiation game.

It's great! I like negotiation games in theory, but after playing a few I began to shy away from them.  The dickering can bog down the game by going in circles. Players can become loud or pushy. Others sometimes get their feeling hurt. And often the constant back and forth becomes tiresome.

I have found that I enjoy negotiating if there are tight limits. In MoH there is a natural limit of things to haggle over in the first place. That fact, in concert with the importance of being close to the Chief of Security, means that often there is equal value in what players are offering, but the seating order will naturally break that tie.

As long as someone closer to the Chief is willing to give the same thing as a further player they will usually prevail.

Of course, alliances sometime win out over proximity, but as the game gets closer to the end, and more dire, those alliances become very tenuous. 

It's all a great balancing act that sometimes gets loud, but moves along pretty quickly. It is a fabulous experience!

New players don't always see this and can drag things out, but soon enough the "math" becomes clear.

As an aside, I love the artwork and I think it is perfectly appropriate for the theme and the nature of the game they, but I also think others may find it offensive or inappropriate (it is dark, violent, sexist).  I suggest that you may want to view some of the images if you think the artwork may not be right for you.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

You are trapped in the mall when the zombie hoards arrive.  The goal is to have the most characters left when the helicopter arrives to save you.

DIY [later purchased]. Definitely not a CLONE of Lifeboats. Better in some ways and worse in others. MOH doesn't have any decisions where all the players are entitled to vote, which makes the negotiations less open and a little nicer than Lifeboats. The shuffling mechanic is less elegant: A simultaneously revealed move that you can sometimes game, for instance if you have anyone in the Parking Lot and expect your chosen destination to be full: pretend you wanted to send that guy, and he'll bounce back to the Parking Lot. And about the Lot: I read a lot of comments about the Security Office being key, but in my game it seemed that if half the players are allied and go to the Parking Lot to monopolize the card draw, they can easily hold the area. Maybe I had too many "kill zombie(s)" cards in my deck. But in the game I played 5/6ths of the surviving pawns belonged to the Parking Lot alliance.

Briefly: Mall of Horror is the boardgame Joss Whedon would design. It takes most every zombie movie cliche and builds it into the gameplay. While my experience isn't exhaustive, I've played quite a few of the zombie-themed games. This one is the best by a significant margin.

Tentative rating after one play with three players. Rating is likely to go up with more players. I have played Rette Sich Wer Kann as well, and in my opinion the games are definitely similar, but I find this game less brutal (and therefore more suitable for nongamers). The reason for this difference is probably the presence of the "item cards", which makes it a bit more random, but which may also enable you to survive a situation in which everbody votes against you (e.g. by means of the "Hidden" cards). The game probably takes less time to play than RSWK as well. Like it especially for the fact that it is very easy to teach and quick to play (i.e. with very little downtime).

RATING: 6.5
Pretty decent game.  I got lucky and had early control over the security cameras.  I kept control over them until the zombies overran the room and I jumped ship.  With a "hidden" card, I was able to get both my guys out.  Since the room was overrun, no-one else went there.  I stayed as the first player for the whole game, and that seemed like too big an advantage.

This is a highly interactive game with the theme of surviving a zombie attack.  The fun part is trying to be in the right place at the right time, but, barring that, collaborating to shove someone else into the hungry horde so as to survive another turn.  The rules are badly organized so it's best to download one of the summaries from this site.

RATING: 4
Either we played this one wrong or it's no fun at all. We had the full compliment of 6 players, but there were rarely situations in which we had to negotiate. The original chief of security managed to hold the position for nearly the entire game and easily won. The only reason it even gets a 4 is because none of us had played before and I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt that we missed an important rule somewhere, but I'm not in a hurry to give it another shot, as I can't fathom my opinion improving substantially.

"Sorry the room is full, guess you get eaten". I love this game. It's the perfect length at around an hour and doesn't take itself too seriously or try to be something it isn't. I approach it as a party game, although it is a bit complex to be one. On the other hand I think it's a bit too simple to be a strategy game, so I guess it's in a class of its own. Fun to play with four or five players, but this game really shines as a six-player game. Can be nasty to be ganged up on, but one needs to take it in stride. Grudges are encouraged in this game. Often seems to be an everyone for themselves mentality anyway. Not for everybody and might be best played with family and/or friends as they are much more likely to forgive you for pushing them into the waiting arms of the undead.

My wife really enjoyed this game at a game convention we went to, so I traded for it when we got back.  This game really really depends on who you are playing with.  It is almost all negotiation, so it is better with players like that.  I need to play this more, with the right people.

RATING: 6
For all intents and purposes, this is the same game as Lifeboats.  However, in adding the "color" to the game, the developers increased the randomness of the outcome and decreased the elegance of the system.  Also, the end game seems to me to have a problem.  In our game, we basically had a three way tie that would have been resolved (more or less) by one last, kingmaking vote by the whole table.  Hardly a satisfactory ending.  While a couple odd dice rolls put the game into this position, I suspect that this type of vote will occur in a fair number of games.  All in all, I'd rather play Lifeboats, and this is a game that doesn't really need to be in the collection.

First the good thing: the theme is well rendered,  it is really funny to think about screaming girls, menacing cops and chainsaw (or whatever) brutes.

The game itself is not very fun, i am sorry to say.
It has a good interaction among players, some bluff, some deceit, a very slight hint of strategy. 
Nothing is really bad about it, it is just the mix that has nothing really appealing.
We didn't get to it, but it seems that if a player looses all his characters, he becomes a zombie and throws other zombies to plaers still in the game. a terrible kingmaking !

Light mechanics, but with the right crowd I think a blast. Don't play with anyone who might be sore at you the next day for turning you out into the cold to be Zombie-Chow(tm). If the folks like zombies, and they don't mind a little back-stabbing action, this is a good game. "I swear, there are no zombies arriving at location X. Look, I will move one of my folks there to show you I am not lying." (plays Sprint card) "Well, you know..."

Played a few times (with 5 players). Rather similar to Rette sich wer kann in its basic ideas, it adds several interesting innovations, which break the monotony of the mechanics (the price to pay, however, is increased chaos). Still, the game remains a bit too long and repetitive for my tastes, in a genre I don't like particularly.

A wonderfully themed game of zombie horror and my favorite of the genre. Unlike (most) action-based zombie games where the goal is to survive by killing zombies, Mall of Horror is about surviving by sacrificing the others to the zombies so that you may live. Wonderful mix of direct and indirect conflict and screwage. RPG.net review at http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13437.phtml

[ORIGINAL REACTION] I picked up Mall of Horror based on several recommendations and Tom Vasel's excellent review. Sounds like a nice, bloody game of backstabbing, betrayal, deception and getting other people in trouble -- basically an entire game of Diplomacy that can be wrapped up in an hour or less. After a quick read through the rules, I can't wait to try it out!

[UPDATE] 2 Plays, and it's as exciting and engaging as I had hoped. The tension and flow fits the zombie theme wonderfully. Players can find themselves eliminated very quickly, though, and reduced to the role of spectator early in the game. I was a bit surprised that the game seemed to slow down as players were eliminated, rather than speed up, and the last half of the game takes much longer to resolve than the first half -- opposite of my expectations for the theme and how these mechanics would work. Could be based on our play group, however... Still, a solid game with lots of deliciously evil powerbrokering decisions.

[UPDATE 2] I've played quite a few games now, and it's still a rock solid game, working incredibly well with 5 and 6 players for all the diplomacy and duplicity goodness.

The rulebook is horribly translated, and while the layout at first looks thematic and cool, it makes it damn hard to find anything at a glance. This means that your first game might take some sighing and rules-flipping. The game itself is very cool, and a great back-stabbing, take-that kind of game. Highly recommended!

The rules, while translated quite poorly, and formatted for anything but readability are actually quite simple. It only takes a single play and you'll know them by heart.

[b]HILARIOUSLY BRUTAL, PYSCHOLOGICAL GAME.[/b]

If you have seen the new "Dawn of the Dead" movie then you are mostly there already in knowing the premise of this boardgame: each player controls a number of archetypes, struggling to survive a zombie invasion by holding up in a mall. Every turn you get to frustrate, eliminate, befriend, decieve, your fellow gamers, while attempting to keep your own dudes alive for the eventual salvation by helicopter.

This game really is a bright shining light in the darkness of zombie gaming. Some zombie-themed games have to be reworked in order for them to play properly, decently - you know of whom I speak. MOH is not one of those games. This is SUPERIOR fare. A psychological game that pits you against your fellow players in ways that other games fear to delve. You really do have to decide which of your opponent's charcters die - on an all too frequent basis.

I also love the artwork on the board and cards, bloodied fingerprints and all. This is a quality release, without a doubt. The only random gameplay elements are the targets of the zombies' attack each turn, and the turn of the equipment cards; the rest of the game is based around pure deduction/negotiation/threat elements.

Gameplay is extremely brutal, and right on the money as far as the theme is concerned. The game is fairly simple in execution, though the rules can make it seem otherwise at times. Each turn is a fest of agonising, head-scratching, nail-biting, hair-pulling, choices. This is one of those games where players immediately want another go; the shortish playing time wins through here. So if you get screwed over in one game, there's time enough for another bash at MOH, if you so wish.

Very happy to own this game, as I have recently got into a phase of watching zombie movies. My favourite videogame is RE4; not that this game is anything to do with that, I'm just into all things zombie at the mo'.

Chances are that my rating will rise for this marvellous game after another evening of zombie survival horror.

[I]Last Night on Earth[/I] may have stolen the limelight for my zombie games, but [I]Mall of Horror[/I] at least still gets pulled off of the shelf on occasion, unlike the four other zombie boardgames that I own which are just gathering dust now. And this is due not only to it's great graphic presentation, but also to the fact that it's a very different creature from other zombie board games, with its own well-oiled mechanics. Do download one of the quick reference sheets and print out several copies, though, as they make for quicker and smoother game-play.

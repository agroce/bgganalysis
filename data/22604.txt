Strong theme, well suited for CDG mechanisms, there's a lot of historical research and design in there.

However it is far too detailed and over-designed for my tastes, too many exceptions, oddities, obscure procedures... for example the hidden PW Cities modifiers, added to the drm on the City itself, then a roll on the Conquest table... wow all this for that? Was this necessary?

The 2 step Leader loss table is another example of need for simplifying. Guerillas are a pain to manage, the supply/attrition rules are heavy,laden with exceptions...

This felt like work, sorry.

To say that the rules are poorly written is to claim that swiss cheese has holes.  Lots of them.  It is a point that has been made by others, though not in reviews, for no one has written anything remotely resembling a real review of this game, with one possible exception.  I do wish that the designers would revise the rulebook.  The thin and out of date errata is not up to the task, and the game, and the people who have bought it, deserve better.  The rules are the worst I have ever seen and do a disservice to GMT.

That being said, once you play the game several times, waste hours looking though, under, over, and by the rulebook, delve into the errata, look at the poorly maintained forums, you discover a sold, playable, interesting game.  

Is it playable "out of the box"?  What a question.  Any game is playable out of the proverbial box.  The question is: in your first few plays with this game, can you expect to have few unanswered questions, with little to no frustration, and a smooth go?  Or something along those lines!  The answer is "no."  Keep playing it.  Be patient.  It is up to you whether or not it is worth your patience.

Another question is: how reflective of history, or the historical possibilities, is the game?  This is more problematic.  Any CDG is luck-based.  Oddly enough, any game that is not a CDG is luck-based.  If anything, there are not enough disease cards, and their ilk, to kill off the some 11 000 or so Americans who lost their lives to such things.  It was better to fight a battle than stay in camp.

We shall see.

I think the game is unbalanced in favour of the Gringos.  It is ironic because so was history; so was reality.  When the home team wins, it is because of good deals and die rolls.

Very elegant looking game.  However, the rules are extremely poorly written, and the mechanics of the rules a bit too complicated with no enhanced value in having them.  Given the historic subject matter, this is an extremely frustrating game to have; knowing that, with a little more effort, it could have been a winner.

I am on turn 3 of my first solo game with the finished product. I playtested this game a couple of times back in 2005/2006.

So far so good. Very nice job of simulating the difficulty of moving/supplying troops at the time and in that theater. LOVE the random supply event. Lots of historical flavor.

There is a fairly large "what do I do"? moment when you finish setting up the game and start playing, and a tiny bit of frustration at how limited your options are in the early going (particularly as the U.S.), but once the war cards get added you have tons of options and things really heat up.

My only criticism is the rule book: it could be organized better.

There might be a good game here, but there are serious holes in the initial release rules, such as how units interact in zones - can they attack? How do they retreat? Given how poorly the designer's previous GMT offering was received (30 Years War) I'm astonished that GMT didn't try a little harder to make sure this game wasn't pronounced DOA as well (which, from the rating of less than 6, it was).

After two plays, doesn't appear that the Americans can win short of just the right confluence of events, dice, unit draws (marines) and reinforcement actions. Other comments back this conclusion.

The first problem is the raiding mechanism, which is far too easy and can generate a net 3 points per turn of Political Will. That means the first action the Americans must take every turn is a raid or the Mexicans will make them pay. The Mexicans, who can afford to play defense, can usually find a 4-ops card to play (virtually guaranteeing they'll get 4 out of 5 of the possible raid markers), while the Americans may not be able to.

The second problem is the total chaos of the action cards and reinforcement rules. If the Mexicans happen to get the reinforcement actions early and often, the US is in deep trouble very, very early. Which means the US has to declare war fairly early. Otherwise, it can't build replacements at all. Even then, Santa Anna might just drive up to San Antonio and smack you before you can get a decent force together. That means you're playing defense for the first few turns while you gather your forces.

Even if the Americans cross over to the point where they can start driving in to Mexican territory, things are problematic. Between Indian raids and Guerillas (an absurd mechanic), the Americans are all but guaranteed to be put out of supply before any major battle outside of Texas.

In the two games we played, the Americans got smoked by Santa Anna in Texas and never had a chance the first game. The second game went much better for the Americans, but it was still a losing effort. It wouldn't have even been close were it not for 2 failed attacks by Santa Anna on San Antonio.

Finally, the rules organization needs work and there are a disturbing number of mismatches between what the counters say and what the rules and/or map says.

I'm hoping the game is reworked for a second edition because it's an interesting conflict that isn't really covered elsewhere.

Traded.

A well balanced CDG which borrows heavily from Wilderness War but in a new little-known setting.  Components and theme are great, rulebook not as much.

This being said, the game felt right enough to make it through the first game and I look forward to playing it again.

After two attempts and 8 hours of play I'd say a good game came in this box. Just be prepared to make an awful lot of command decisions regarding how it should be played: the Index is not complete, some important rules are missing and others are hidden on the various playing aid cards. I always thought playing aid cards were suppose to hold aids to play, and the rules were suppose to hold, well, the rules. But what do I know. 

  For example: the PW counters should be randomly placed on the PW cities before the game starts (this is missing from the rules), the numbers printed on the PW cities themselves are not how their capture effects the PW level (as we first thought) but modifiers for the "captured city" chart on a playing aid, the supply chit the rules talk about is actually the logistics chit, the strategy  cards are really the Event cards, and I defy anyone to know what's with the "standard re-inforcements" after putting anything less than 6 hours into this game. But what the word "exile" means on the information/record chart is something we still haven't figured out. Its meaning may be in there, somewhere, but if it is, it's hidden well.  

  So, if you are interested in the Mexican-American war, like CDG and are not easily upset by an over-abundance of ambiguity then this game is for you.

The rules are a tough slog, but the game is rewarding and I hope to see some mechanics, particularly the action card deck, find their way into other games.  Unfortunately the details can be lost and sometimes the game feels convoluted, as the whims of fate can be bitter. One small gripe: Zachary Taylor sucks in this game. Just doesn't seem fair to old rough and ready.

The rules have problems, but with the errata and FAQs, most issues have been resolved.  I consider the biggest shortcoming to be that the design overcompensated a bit to tilt balance toward the Mexicans.  Still an interesting game on a little covered area.  I, for one, like the map a lot with the period design.

RATING: 2
HoM has turned into a huge disappointment for me, esp. after being one of the first pre-orders years ago.

The mechanics of the game are layed-out in some of the reviews, and the publishing errors are well-documented in the forum, so I will focus on the more fundamental issues I have with the game.

Two F2F games resulted in very easy victories for Mexico, as noted in some other comments.  While I won't go so far as to say the US can't win, or even is unlikely to win, I will say that whether or not Mexico loses probably has little to do with player actions and more to do with how the reinforcements turn out, how the combat efficiency rolls go, and how the government collapse die rolls go.

The first major problem is the raid mechanic.  Unlike Wilderness War, the units that raid are not placed on the map, and thus you can not set-up barriers against the raids, and there is no risk of losing units by raiding.  The success is just a die roll, which is critically increased by the OPS card value.  Playing a 4OPS virtually guarantees you 4 succesful raids, and only 5 are allowed per turn.  Not only is this uninteresting, it forces the US to spend cards on raids just to keep the Mexican player from gaining free political will (PW).

On a similar vein to the raid problem is the use of random PW markers on each city.  The fact that these markers are left out of both the rules and the setup card indicates to me that the whole idea was not thought out very well.  The markers do not change the PW result of taking a city, they modify the die roll that determines the PW of each city.  Since this assignment is random and unknown to both players, why does it matter?  There is an action card that lets you see the counter, or switch two counters, but these are going to be equally distributed between the players, so that aspect is another pointless mechanism (e.g. I know a value, you know a value, I switch the counters, you switch them back).  Since victory depends on the taking of PW cities, you are going to take every one that you can, and I very much doubt that a strategy other than the Saltillo/Monterrey offensive and the Vera Cruz/Mejico invasion are going to work, regardless of how the PW counters are randomly placed. 

The second major problem is the primary reinforcement mechanisms.  The first mechanism is the random action card draw at the beginning of the turn.  Since the cards are not removed after used, things can easily get out of balance if one side receives reinforcements when the other does not.  This can happen in a game like Wilderness War, but it is balanced by the fact that the reinforcement card is removed from the game, so the force imbalance is only temporary.  Aggravating this is that the second mechanism for reinforcements is the play of an OPS card, plus a die roll - this is not good as HoM uses a 10-sided die, causing huge swings in forces available depending on how you roll.  A 6-sided die or a 2d10- (difference of 2d10) would be much more balanced here.

The final fundamental problem here, and the one that is the real game-killer is the battle system.  The firepower of armies that decide to fight are going to be very close in firepower and die roll modifiers.  

Say the US player has an edge and engages a 20FP Mexican army with a 25FP US army, with a +1 edge in efficiency (+3 to +2).  This scenario happens all of the time as the US army is better, but they are moving and the Mexicans tend to be entrenched.  If the US rolls 0 and the Mexicans roll 9, the step loss differential is 2 to 10!  Less extreme, however, is just the Mexican rolling average (5); this is 7 losses and the US will lose on a 0-4 roll.  Not getting into raw statistics, but even a very good FP differential gives you a 25% chance of losing, at least.  

The Mexicans can take a loss of this magnitude, but the US can not; the US is also unlikely to have an FP and efficiency edge as the need to move in hostile territory will leave them less potential for battle cards (remember the US had to spend one or two cards raiding) and more step losses from attrition, while the Mexican digs in and maximizes his forcepool.  Keep in mind that the US is going to have to win 3 or 4 battles, so eventually they are going to pay and have a good roll/bad roll combination that hands the game to the Mexican.

Added to the above is one of the worst rules I have seen in a game - the 'Guerilla arrival' rule.  The Mexican can hide a guerilla after a raid, and drop a card to bring it into a battle - automatically knocking the US army out of supply with no countermeasure.  This is a 6FP shift.  Any battle that matters will have the US army out of supply, thus having less FP than the Mexicans - good luck with that one, Winfield.

The battle table also screams out for a 2d10- roll, rather than 1d10.  There is just way too much owing to luck here, and very little owing to what the player does and does not do.  The battle could also be streamlined by removing the whole lead unit/committed unit mechanism; given the luck results of the table itself, worrying about lead and committed units adds very little.

Yes, the raids might balance out, the Mexican government might collapse early, and the US might not get out-rolled in battle, but then who won, the US player, or the game?

The theme of this game is great and I very much like the artwork, map layout, and player aid cards.  However, when you add in the publishing errors, the fundamental design issues, and the massive luck inputs, I will not be playing this game again.

One of the few GMT games I have had to take a substantial loss on to sell.

This game took a beating on the boards when it first came out. FINALLY played it. Love it! Will post an AAR soon. In summary, an integrated poly mil strategic game that packs a great story line and fab play pop. SMART design that borrows from some of the best in card driven wargame genre.

Quit disappointed in this game, it looked quite interesting. The other card driven games I own are much better.

Map and component are nice, only the thickness of the placards is not up to scratch.

To be diplomatic the rules are not the best written in the world. There are already a load of rules clarifications and errata.
 
Played the game three times, The Americans got seriously beaten al three time. Twice in turn four, the third time they were able to hold on to turn seven.

This was caused by a combination of good card draw of the Mexican player and bad dive roles by the American player. In my opinion the luck factor is to high.

Would like to play once more just to see if the American player can win the game.

I have only soloed a few turns so far, but I am quite impressed so far.  It is innovative in its use of an Action Deck to randomize the amount of movement points available to a force as a function of the activation rating of the commanding general.  The same deck triggers four random events each turn.

The only significant shortcoming of the game so far is that the development of the rules and the proofreading (e.g., of the turn track) could have been better.  However, the developer is fully engaged in regard to rectifying these issues.  So, it should only be a temporary blemish.

My rating of the game may improve after its gets some PBeM and/or face-to-face play.

(On second thought, I hope Fox and Welker can do one on the medieval Europe around 10th to 15th century.)

I was truly surprised that the situation was so intriguing, but... the rules are really a messy and I don't like the battle system, as I feel that there are too much rules/calculation involved for a so wild CRT: nothing against wild results, but not if I have to spend so much time in calulating Firepower, modificators, etc. I feel the raid rules a little "throw in" because in Wilderness War they works really well; here I don't think they are so cool. Anyway for me the rules are really the biggest trouble.

The indexing could be better as it is quite difficult to find the rules you need.  A pity, as the game is not horribly complex.    Some interesting angles on this one.  A rarely-gamed conflict I know little about, so playing the game teaches me a lot of history.  My friend thought the random factor pretty high, and I guess I agree to a point, but can understand why it is there in the context of what the designers trying to do.  Not the easiest to get into because of the more obscure topic, map colors not matching markers too well, and oddly located rules, but makes an enjoyable tale with drastic sways in fortunes.  really like the movement mechanism.

        As someone who followed the development of Halls of Montezuma on the CSW and BGG forums and looked forward to its release with much anticipation, I had high hopes for the success of one of GMT’s newest CDGs. Despite the maps "muddy and dull" appearance and the confusing color scheme of its spaces, the rest of the components (counters, play-aids and cards) are top notch and typical of what I have come to expect from GMT’s products. 

        The rules (THE HEART OF ANY GAME), however, are another story. While at first glance the rules are fairly well laid out, organized and easy to read through, when one puts them to practice in actual play holes and omissions become apparent and confusion reigns. Despite numerous play thrus since release my opponents’ and I are still confused by a number of the rules processes, if we are playing correctly, or even what the purpose of some rules are. Designers-Developers who live with a project for years can fall into the trap of seeing how to play their creation very clearly in their mind while the final rules do not convey the same clarity to someone seeing the finished product for the first time. HoM seems to suffer from this effect or perhaps just from a lack of actual playtester or especially non-tester input to the final as released rules contributing to their non-clarity and other problems. 

        Balance also seems to have suffered from lack of late testing. One example allows the US player to declare War early (turn 2) suffering little to no penalty to its victory requirements due to the maximum allowable level of Political Will (PW) points undermining a primary and vital part of the game. This may not ALWAYS lead to a US win (it sure helps though), but it defiantly takes away from the tension the US player would feel if there was a reason NOT to declare war early. The Designers-Developer repeatedly miss the point of why creating such a "No Brainer" option in a CDG takes some of the "FUN" out of playing….

        From the credits the Designers-Developers seem to have relied quite heavily on other Designers and Developers to play test HoM. I can’t help but wonder what the quality and amount of feedback was that they received from these individuals. Maybe they just need to rely more on just plain folks and get more of a common players opinion of their creation?

        Another MAJOR failing of the Designers-Developer (and yes GMT too) is the total lack of any method for internet play at release through Vassal or Cyberboard leaving it to "Fans" of the game to make their own. In this day and age and given GMT’s support of internet play this omission is practically unforgiveable! The good news is that with the effort of Gene at GMT and others, the necessary game Vmods and GameBoxes are now in the works. It is hard to understand why today’s Designers-Developer would not use these vital tools for playtesting, not to mention to drive sales, and such out of date paper & pencil testing as must have been used for HoM may be one of the reasons for HoM’s problems.

        While Some errata has been supplied and the Designers-Developer frequent the forums, their at times incomplete/off-hand answers to honestly asked and non-hostile questions from confused customers quite often lead to more confusion and more questions. To make matters worse the Designers-Developer seem to take offense to these requests for clarification of their answers and their responses at times have become insulting, included the Deletion of questions/comments and the Threat of banning from the forum those who ask questions they do not like or who do not use the "Proper Tone." This "attitude" on the part of the Designers-Developer has very likely driven many individuals away from the forums and away from HoM! I do know that most of the members of my gaming group (29 weekly regulars) have chosen to pass on HoM.

        I had planned to give HoM a 4 BGG rating despite its short comings and because my opponents and I have had some fun playing later games using "House Rules." But given the Designers-Developer post release Attitudes towards GMT’s customers I CANNOT recommend HoM to others and am giving it a 2 rating. Fields of Fire is the only game in my collection that deserves a 1 IMO and HoM is better than FoF. Still I have regulated my copy of HoM to the dust bin of "The Shelf."

        UNFORTUNATELY, in the case of HoM the Designers and the Developer have managed to shoot themselves in the foot while at the same time stabbing GMT in the back!  

It's fun. Nice scenario. Would rate it one point higher if it didn't feel so underdeveloped. Too much looking into the rulebook without finding answers.

Commendable effort trying to wargame/CDG this historical topic.  Really a fun effort on an obscure time period soon to be overshadowed by the American Civil War.  Cards are very nice and despite some complaints, the rules work.  My only major gripe would be the map is a tortilla/taco shell color that offers little in the way of imagination; is all of Mexico a seemingly barren desert? Feel sorry for any of you out there who bought this game and are color blind...

CDG from GMT, the Mexicans won my only game, but that dragged out over a week as it failed to interest me enough. My advice to the Yanks is to go to full war asap.

Très bon "card driven game". Parfois assez déroutant mais exploitant avec finesse un théâtre d'opération mal connu chez les européens

I enjoy seeing a game on this period. It has a nice length and is not a complex CDG. However, it still manages to capture quite bit of the historic theme. That does lead to a lot of wild swings. If you want to build and execute your perfect plan, HOM is not for you. If you want to try to do the best in face of adverse circumstance....

I like to see the attrition effects of movement, and battles, the difficulties of supply. However, the replacement effects keep things moving. 

Being familiar with several CGS's I did not have problems with rules that a bit of common sense and knowledge of the era couldn't fix. I spent more time trying to figure out what should I be doing versus how to do things according to the rules.

 Another CDG. but the Mexican-American war is interesting subject.

It is probably the best game published so far on the US-Mexican War. I need to read more about the subject before I comment on how close it mirrors the war. After playing it solitaire I feel even though I had a blast playing it that it is best played with two players. One loses the surprise element of the fog of war with the other persons' hand. I noticed this more so with it than with the other GMT card driven games. I believe gamers will like how quick it plays and it's complexity level. I still am happy I got it. I did not like the coloring of the map the states spaces are not defined as well as they could be. The game is a bit scripted. Needs a new rule book.

Surprisingly good game! Fascinating period. Mixture of Strategy and Action Cards keept the game flowing, plenty of reinforcements and replacements to compensate for the many opportunities for bad strategy I have personally discovered. Next game I'll try some different tactics - the game has loads of possibilities  for both US and Mexican players.

Un bon travail historique. Toutefois, je ne suis pas convaincu par la nécessité d'un CDG, le jeu de cartes me paraissant artificiel (un système d'initiative à la CW de VG pourrait convenir).

RATING: 5
While every CDG has its share of problems, there are some basic things here that really should have been addressed. 

Borrows heavily from other CDG's, and some items just seem to be patched together, which feels a bit odd (e.g., raids are way overrated).

The game is imbalanced in favor of the US, but the challenge of playing the Mexicans still makes for a decent contest.

Only pushed counters around for a few turns to learn the game. Cross between Wilderness War and For the People.

Not the most clear & complete rules but (very) beautiful components, very enjoyable game and very good replayability.

RATING: 7.3
This is a game which I would like to rate higher, but can't.  It has a large number of good ideas contained within it, but also some elements which could use a little work.  The Indian raids, for instance, can cause a great deal of havoc and that doesn't seem all that historically accurate.  The combat system makes sense, but the final results take far too long to tabulate.  In fact, if the game came with a CPA, battles would be determined perfectly.  Despite these problems, the game is certainly worth a play and I would not be surprised if I enjoyed it more upon a second play.

Great game marred by poorly structured rules. There is a gem here if you are willing to look, the reward is worth it. Lots of options for each player, some randomness from events. My biggest gripe is why they chose to have "Action" cards drawn during the event phase and "Event" cards drawn during the action phase, makes no sense. Some errata on map and counters but what game doesn't. Not too many games on this war and on this level. Has enough Historical feel but doesn't bog down game play. Can be played in around 2 hours.

Interesting subject, but a very different combat system than most CDG designs.  Combat is a little clunky.  Components are very good as usual from GMT.

HoM offers a single campaign scenario playable in two to three hours, given sudden death victory conditions. This makes the game ideal for an evening of friendly play as well as for tournaments and play-by-email. If you enjoy the other CDG's, HoM brings you the Mexican-American War in a format that hearkens to the design elegance and playing time of We The People ™, the ground-breaking game by Mark Herman. HoM uses mechanics and cards to capture the excitement, tension, and uncertainty of this rarely simulated conflict from American history, the war that was a training ground for so many generals who would become fierce enemies in a later conflict. Can Mexico emerge as a new North American power or will the United States fulfill its Manifest Destiny?

Not really bad - by BGG standards, 4 means I could be talked into it occasionally -  but pretty rules-heavy and a lot to remember for a game that has such a large luck component.

Might have gotten an extra point if it hadn't obviously been released before it was ready.

CDG but potentially benign: "In my game, The Halls of Montezuma, there is a special deck that contains a series of events that are outside of the players' control. These events happen in an initial phase of each turn, including stuff like reinforcements and weather..."

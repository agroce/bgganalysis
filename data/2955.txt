RATING: 8
An area control game with action points that plays well with 2-4 players, and is surprisingly different enough from Tikal to warrant owning both.  This game requires some creative tile-laying and judicious use of the action points, and provides multiple ways to score points.  Rather light on the theme, but if you like Kramer games and/or area control, you'll like this one.

Mexica is about the same level of complexity as Settlers, and combines cool building aspects with area control and a neat movement mechanism. It's definitely a keeper for me. Mexica has some really neat mechanics, namely the ability to move your Mexica quickly across the canals and lake, and the ability to define (or ruin) the various areas you are trying to influence. There are not that many decision to be made, so once someone feels comfortable with the game I think analysis paralysis will be minimal. It definitely took us longer than it should have, but none of us had played an action point game before. After we master this one, we'll move on to Tikal, and then Java.

Interesting area control game. The great thing about this game is that the map is not yet drawn. The way the districts come to reality drawing the map and building the pyramids are very dynamic and beautiful. The problem with this game is the start, very open and you really doesn't imagine what you are doing at all. The good thing is that things are shaped quickly and clever.

This game is my favorite area majority game.  Love the gameplay, love the look, love the heavy resin pieces that feel like rock.  When I first read the rules I thought the game would take a fair amount of time, but it flew by even on the first playthrough.  I have so far only played it with 3, but it has been a huge hit in our 3 plays so far with 3 different groups.

[Update]
Plays great with 4 too!

Have to play this again.  Seems like a cool idea, and is reviewed fairly well, but when I played a 3 player game, each turn started to feel the same.  What seems like a large selection of actions to choose from really isn't and I found myself getting bored.  It may be because one of us wasn't feeling good and wasn't fully engaged, but I suspect not.  Have to replay to confirm or (hopefully) refute my initial feelings on this.

My favourite of the Kramer/Kiesling action points and tile laying trilogy. Oddly, it reminds me a little of Lowenherz/Domaine as a contest for control of areas of land defined by the players (canals replace Lowenherz's fences).  For a low complexity game it gives you an awful lot to think about and too few action points to get it all done with.  Like its predecessors, Mexica is unforgiving of errors.

This is a fun "action point" game.  Granted, the game is somewhat quirky in design:  placing canals down to define districts, teleporting, getting back to the start position to earn more points.  But, for me, I really enjoy the quiet competitive aspect of the game.

Fun area control and take that type of game.  Surprised this went under the radar for me for so long.

Quicker, simpler, and for my money, better than Tikal (since it lacks the latter's need to count and re-count the points you'll score every round). Best (most calculating) player doesn't always win (unlike Tikal).  Needs a little tweaking, though.

Action Points and building. This game speeds along nicely if everyone is focused and is not as "brain-burny" as Java in the same series. The way the island builds up into a sprawling ancient metropolis is fantastic and the canals really speed up the movement around the board.

i had low expectations with this always seeming to come is as the lowest rated game of the quadrilogy, but i was somewhat surprised.  nice and tactical without excessive AP.  i think it needs a couple tweaks, like not shutting the last 2 players out of extra action chips in a 4 player game on the 2nd round through.  it's overall enjoyable, but i'm concerned about turn order.

Now, having played all of the Mask Trilogy, I can confidently say that Tikal is my favorite, but probably only because of the exploration theme. Mexica is fun, and I want to play it again -- but it's a dry, calculating, nose-bleedy kind of fun.

I own the newer version and the game and components are just beautiful.  Game play is a lot of fun as players define their own areas for control.  Turns are very straightforward and players need some creativity to optimize moves.  Solid game and will hit the table often.

RATING: 6
This is in the same series as Tikal and Java, but it is likely the lightest of the 3.  The game shares the action point mechanic, but that's the end of the similarities.  This one is about area control.  There are several options for strategy, but not so many that the game calls back to you to play again and again with just one more approach.  A solid and good game  for the occasional play.  [GTI: AGSL]

RATING: 8
Just one game, difficult to judge the possibilities it offers.  Played with the new edition, piramids are really cool.  But the Spanish rules booklet is awful.  I did not even read it completely and found several grammar mistakes that should be avoided at all cost in a professional product.
The game itself uses Action Point mechanics to create enclosures to claim and to build your piramids, in order to get points using majorities.   And at the same time, you need to move your meeple around using the channels you actually create to create the enclosures.  Very interactive, you can block the other players, build higher than them and do quite a lot of nasty things.
The only slightly negative point I felt was that in the second era, it is almos obligatory to rebuild bridges continuously, and it feels a bit strange.  Probably it means we did not play very wisely.
Much more relaxed than Tikal, by the way.

Played once, love the components and have not played anything like it before. Very interesting so far. Kind of like Hive meets Chess in a weird way. Want to play more to see but gets an 8 so far as it seems very good and looks soooo good.

Next play, and not sure we are playing the right strategy, and my wife is not loving it (she just wants to play Lost Cities all the time at the moment though, lol)
Want to keep experimenting but not sure wife will want to play again so think this will not hit the table and be up for trade!

Mexica is the most speedy of the action point games.  It's sort of a streamlined version of Torres.  I find Mexica more dynamic for the board is much bigger and less restricted.  I love the Canal movement that allows you to travel great distances.  I also love the finite number of extra action chits.  Timing is very important in Mexica.  Knowing when to delay your actions and also  knowing when to play at full speed separates the newbies from the veterans.
      
I prefer playing with 3 players for I find that the 2-player game feels slightly less optimal and the 4-player game almost encourages kingmaking.  However, I enjoy playing Mexica with any number of competent players.

Calculating area influence board game with practically no randomness. Allows for players to attack each other directly by fighting for control of districts. Aesthetically pleasing too. Strategy consists of efficiently utilizing those action points, holding action chits whenever you can, and only utilizing the minimum buildings to grab control of districts or gain presence. A great calculating game which should be played with a timer.

I have owned Tikal for a number of years and it has been one of my favorites, when Mexica was reprinted I knew I wanted to try it.  After one play I am hooked!  I love how there is the spatial aspect of creating districts but then also the puzzle of moving your piece to be able to add temples and to found the districts.  Like all of Kramer's games the choices are mechanically straight forward but complex in interaction with everything on the board, the definition of elegance.  The production values of the Super Meeple edition is phenomenal too!  If you are not afraid of a little brain burner then you will love this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
You kinda want the last in a series to end in a big crescendo, one that blends the best of what went before with nail-biting new subtleties, and that final plot twist that the designers were holding back for that [i]ta-ta[/i] moment all along...

..and Mexica stubbornly refuses to deliver that final high note. In fairness, it was never meant to do that, but having anticipated it as the action point curtain closer for  (Torres,) Tikal, and Java, hoping for one last peak comes naturally.

So, what do we have? Well, a great game really, and a showcase for how action points can enable people to get very creative and inventive on an infuriatingly tight action allowance budget. It is a bit more forgiving than Tikal and Java, where each action really matters, partly because game play is more free form, but mostly because players only have a single pawn to move around with, making it virtually impossible for leaders to control the game to such an extent that all back doors are safely bolted up to intruders.

District creation by placing canal tiles, and the canal movement mechanism in general are smooth and clever, and trigger far more complicated considerations than you'd expect. Blocking easy access, or freeze-outs, with well-positioned buildings or bridges can swing the game, and effective canal movement towards the end-game becomes a dance in itself. Saying that, it is a shame that standing on a bridge at the end of a turn is such an effective way to block cheap access to key districts, and disproportionally so. With extra Action Point hoarding for final power moves, it is the only constant in game that plays out very differently from game to game. By introducing a simple and small variable at the start, each time the canal city will be carved out radically differently, guaranteed. And thus create a whole new set of game and movement considerations to agonize about.

One thing I really appreciated in Tikal was that didn't matter what other people did to your position after you had your final move: you scored your personal game snapshot at your private peak. In this game that is gone, and final scores are tallied up at the conventional "end of the game". In a perfect information game that can be analysed with pin-point precision, and also allows people to hoard action points for final super-moves, and in which leaders are kept in check throughout the game through selective targeting, it is pretty hard for the first player(s) to build up a lead that will stand up to maxed-out erosion at the end. Having up to 30 action points spend against you in the final turn and come out of that as the leader is quite a challenge.

It is probably because the rest works so well that the final score even presents itself a a "problem", when in reality it  is thoroughly enjoyable, and winnable, as the starting player. But that it wasn't addressed by the designers does underpin the overall impression that this game is a bit less bothered about being evenly balanced, or taxing, and opted for free, and carefree, flowing play over deep analysis of each and every option avaialble.

On the flip-side, that can also be a good thing. It certainly plays much faster than Tikal and Java, which frequently grind to a halt because a player refuses to settle on a move before the board has been [i] really[/i] assessed from all possible angles. Mexica is a bit more forgiving, and maybe will be typified as a less "weighty" game because of it. I suspect that is a bit deceptive, as all the games I have played have seen pretty complicated, and surprising, end strategies.

What is true is that it works better as a 4-player game than a 3-player game. Two players inevitably will find themselves roughly caught up in the same area, both unwilling to be the spend who spends Action Points to get out of the other player's hairs as it will also come at the cost of giving up a valuable stake. So they are both inclined to spend a lot of points protecting their investments without gaining anything new. This will create a shortage of ammunition (buildings) to stop the third player gaining valuable stakes in a quiet part of the board, without facing similar competing pressures, and who can also keep some bigies back for final majority adjustments towards the end of the game.

Visually this is a top-notch production, and it certainly invites game play. That it was the last in series of 3 strong titles by the same designer duo, based on pretty similar starting ingredients, might have put it in a bigger shadow than it deserves. Maybe out of misguided belief it is "pretty similar", and thus left untried and untested in favour of something seen as new and sparkly. Had this come out first, I am sure it would have had a lot more attention, instead of being the harder to recall title when you ask people for games in the so-called Mask-trilogy.

A more accessible alternative to Tikal that has clever player movement mechanics.  Competition over territory can be a bit more dynamic, and the room for 2nd and 3rd place points in each district is a bit more forgiving than the winner-take-all aspects of Tikal.  Goes over reasonably well with some enthusiastic light gamers, but definitely not a gateway game.

11/09 - Decidedly my favorite from the mask series and of Kramer's action point games.  I love the fluidity of the game, the quickness of using the points, along.  Also, it's such a great looking board, very pleasing.

Way better than Java but not quite as good as Tikal.  There's just less to think about, or less going on, or something.  I don't ever seem to have two equally good choices like Tikal gives me.  Plus, the whole digging canals, sailing down the canals from bridge to bridge thing makes little rational sense.  Don't get me started on the "teleport" option.

Pretty good action point allowance game.  Somewhat abstract.  At the beginning, it's wide open... there's no right answer for what you should do other than trying to get points.  It's fun/tense at the end when you're trying to get a few last buildings placed to gain or maintain majorities.  The waterways allow players to go almost anywhere on bridges... and that kills this game for me.

Fun game.

You have to carefully spend resources to control areas and with this control you garner points.

Solid action point game. Has a lot of strategy and tactics in the game.
Quite a lot player take-that interaction. There is a lot of fighting over the control over the highest paying areas.
But that gives a high tension in the game, because you don't know if the other players see the same opportunity as you do.
A clear winner in the AP games.

This is an interesting offering of the three mask action point games I have yet played (haven't played Java). I still like Tikal, and feel like it will remain my favorite of the four mask series games. The six actions helps it to move along a little faster than Tikal, but there it is more tactical and therefore less strategic. The bridge movement for the Mexica really helps this game to shine with those tactical options. Enjoyed the few plays so far in this fast-paced area control game.

Too bad this game was stuck in a trilogy with Tikal and Java because this is a hidden gem of a game that most people end up never trying.  Better with four than with three but this game is good, light, wicked fun.  Unfortunately, going last gives an enormous advantage and going first creates a significant disadvantage, and the players will need to self-balance this in their strategy.

I purchased this game for two reasons: I own the other two in the series and enjoy them both, and I've heard that this one is "the best". I would have to disagree. Java (for me) is the most complex and AP prone, so it needs the right group of players. Tikal is a lighter version of Java and fits in quite well in my family. Because of that I would say Tikal is my favorite, but I do like Mexica and haven't yet played it with all of my groups.

Having found Tikal, Java, and Torres all to be rather overrated and extremely dull, I admit I had low expectations of Mexica ... which made Mexica a very pleasant surprise. This is a solid, interesting game, which might be just a touch too complex, but nontheless for me works much better than Tikal or Java simply because it's much less prone to analysis paralysis, but still maintains a strong tactical element. Of the compete-for-areas games, certainly not in the same class as El Grande, El Cabellero, Taj Mahal, or even Samurai, but still a very solid game.

I've finally played Mexica, which was the last game played in the mask series for me.  I really tactical games, and Mexica certainly fits into the tactical gaming genre.  The only drawback is that it seemed like doing well in the first half of the game is really important, and if you do poorly in the first half it seems that it would be tough to make a comeback in the second half.  A minor quibble for me though since the game isn't all that long and I really enjoyed the gameplay.

"Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood." That about describes it for me. Neat concept. Area control with folks building the areas. Like the final look of the Aztec capital. But somehow I feel something is missing. At least for me. Quite frankly, I don't see why one should get this off the shelf rather than El Grande. Is it shorter? Hm perhaps a bit. But people seemed to take longer to do their move with this one rather than with El Grande. So, I doubt there is a big difference.

Mexica is so mean, it's glorious. Stealing district foundings from someone who built the entire thing, and having them get back at you by stealing the area majority after you agree to go for the tie on it- great. Bridges are everything here- you control the bridges, you control the board.

Playing the other Kramer AP games, I now understand how compelling this game can be.  It is still a bit too open for my tastes.  I like choices, but there comes a time when a player is allowed to do too much.  Java is even more open, but I find it much more to look and the ponderables are more interesting.  In either case, you have the capacity to make a gigantically clever move.  I like that about the Kramer games, and he still remains my favorite designer.

Very reminiscent of Tikal, which makes sense consider the production, designers, and even box size.

Rated 6 after one play. I can certainly see the similarities between Mexica and Tikal. Mexica is a good game; it's just got tough competition because I like Tikal better. Is this because I learned Tikal first? I dunno.

I had heard that Mexica is easier than Tikal. But after playing it, I'd say both actually have the same rules complexity. For me Tikal seems a bit more thematic. I feel like I'm exploring a jungle, even if the game is abstract. With Mexica, I don't know what I'm doing other than adding buildings. The canal movement doesn't convey the theme. Also in Mexica, there's a heck of a lot of blocking with building placement, switching of bridges, etc. That seems slightly more mean-spirited than Tikal.

Mexica's fine, but it's not going to knock Tikal out of its preferred spot. It is, however, another gorgeous game with striking colors and attractive buildings. My opinion might improve with another play and I'd gladly give it another shot, but it's a 6 for now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an action points-based game that involves fencing off areas, putting down buildings to stake claims over areas, and moving to the correct locations to execute such moves.  There's enough to the game that it can lead to some analysis paralysis, for better or for worse.

RATING: 7
Solid action point allowance game, although probably the worst of the trilogy for me. 

There are a lot of intricacies involved with the spatial calculations including bridge placement and displacement, blocking and squeezing. Also interesting are the the parasitic relationships (2nd and 3rd scoring) and the big red light of the final scoring of the non-founded regions. 
Quite confrontational and spatially challening, and an AP hell if you are so prone, although less than Tikal and Java. For some reason though, it is also as fun as either of them for me. The definition of solid, but unexciting.

RATING: 7
Originally played Tikal years ago. From comments on the Geek, I didn't expect to think much of Mexica. I thought I'd find it too chaotic. But I really dig it.

First of all, as with each of the mask trilogy, the components are outstanding. I love the covers of all three of these game boxes. But just setting up the board makes me want to play. 

The most common criticism I've seen is that of the canals allowing too easy of movement from place to place (via bridges). I don't think there is any problem there at all. Its up to other players to move bridges, and to set up districts in such a way so that it isn't easy to simply float in there.

The place where I think there may be a potential problem is the action disks. The earlier players can simply horde these and when the supply is exhausted, whichever players have the next couple turns are obligated to use all 6 action points. I'm not sure that each of the 4 seats have an equal chance to win from the start. Its helpful to go last in terms of swiping scoring chances. Its helpful to get more action disks by going earlier. Maybe those two forces are perfectly balanced, but I'm not sure. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very solid Action Point game that manages to add yet more wrinkles to the familiar system. Like Java, the luck factor here is non-existent (even moreso than Java actually, the only random elements in this game are less significant than Java's cards), unlike Java the pace of play is much faster, more like Torres, as the piece placement is a bit more straight forward (though direct conflict is just as high) and movement easier. I like the storage of extra action points from this game, as well as the new idea of not only creating areas, but forming majorities within them by the placement of the temples as opposed to the swarms of pieces from the other two masked AP games. 

I like Mexica a lot and it falls just short of the greatness that Tikal and Java represent. At first I thought this game was signficantly lighter, but in fact, it really isn't. There isn't the 3D tile placement of Jave, or the auction of Tikal, so it suffers a bit, but overall I think this is still a great title and it plays in half the time of the other two games, so it seems like it should be more likely to receive table time.

I think this is a great game. It has some elements of Java and Tikal but is better. It also has some elements of Tycoon. I think highly of all those games. This is the best of the bunch. As I mentioned with Tikal/Java I think these games are not overly long at all. We played a three player game and to me every players move was interesting. The moves took very little time except the odd one. We don't allow people to calculate the score before making there move. This was our first game and with learning the rules we came in at about 2 hrs. I'd expect that to easily improve.

Use water tiles to divide an island into districts.  Move your Mexica around the board to found districts and build pyramids.  For veeps during play, claim a Calpulli tile to Found a district that your Mexica is in.  Veeps in the two scoring rounds are calculated by summing the height of each players buildings in a founded district then awarding descending amounts of points to first, second, and third place.  The strategy lies mainly in deciding when and where to place pyramids.  

Better with four players than two.

RATING: 6
Mexica is the smaller brother of Tikal and Java. I've never been able to pinpoint exactly why I liked it less than its brethren; even realising they are in some way or another majority games didn't help all that much. I do think that this element is the most pronounced with Mexica: Tikal only requires you to have the majority at the time you score, so everyone more or less gets a shot at the maximum number of points. Java more or less uses this mechanism too: you only get points if you are on the highest position; other players can hinder you if you want to hold a party. But Mexica uses the 1st, 2nd and rest-mechanism. This makes 'leeching' a far more interesting strategy (in other words, letting someone else do the hard work of staying in first place, while you yourself do just enough to remain second), with construction of neighbourhoods placing a far greater emphasis on scoring than you'd think at first. That said, there is no shame in opening up small neighbourhoods as leeches will not bother joining you there, so there is some means of defense against the strategy, even if it feels unassuming and mundane. Anyhow: the open districts near the end can too be a real killer if you're not careful, and you should always be on the lookout for someone emptying the channel draw stack before you get to place a coveted calpulli chip.

The open information-aspect of Mexica doesn't really impose on the players: matters are very fluid to the point where the game doesn't really need any randomness at all. 

Regrettably Mexica is the only one of the trio which is not so good to play with 2. It is either a boring race, or an insanely cut-throat game. Causes are the emphasis on majority play and the complete lack of unknown, or hindring elements. It would be much better if San Marco- or Mykerinos-style rule variants were to be proposed.

All in all: a good game in its own right, but just less than Tikal and Java. If a better 2-player variant becomes available, then I might consider upgrading the rate, as I like the AP-mechanism a great deal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mexica is definitely better than Tikal, haven't played Java.  It's one of the few Euros I know of that's perfect information once the first 8 district markers are flipped; as a result, there is a low luck factor, although depending on how the marker flips work, there may be a slight favoritism towards the first player.  It plays better with four players, as there is a lot more interaction when the board is more filled.

I can recall a time when I would have [i]loved[/i] this game. The spatial aspect is really appealing, the buildings you use to claim areas also block movement (further enhancing the spatial aspect) and vary in size (meaning someone who's filled half the spaces in an area isn't necessarily winning it).

These days, I'm less jazzed, simply because my tastes have changed. I still enjoy playing it (and might be interested to see what happens playing multiple times with the same group, so we could learn from each others' dirty tricks), but the gestalt doesn't excite me as much as other games do.

Production: Quality components that form a beautiful mosaic by game's end.

Play: A more elegant use of the action point system than Tikal, with the real challenge of the game being how to efficiently utilize the canal system to move about one's mexica.  The game features many delicious intricacies, such as deciding whether to stay back and solidify a territory or to spread out and build a presence in multiple territories.  It feels like actions are cheap, and there are many things to do, so each turn I can accomplish several things. (3+2+5) (5 plays)

Mexica, Mexxxiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiica !!
C'est un jeu qui vient de sortir, mais certains d'entre vous se diront (les plus anciens) : "Tiens, ça me rappelle quelque chose". Et pour cause, c''est édité par SuperMeeple, encore un nouvel éditeur. Et cet éditeur se spécialise dans les ré éditions d'anciens jeux qui ont eu leur moment de gloire. Du coup, ils ressortent le jeu en y mettant un p'tit coup de lifting. Mexica, c'est un jeu de Kramer sorti en 2002. Vous savez, l'auteur de Tikal (Si vous ne le saviez pas, réparez cette erreur, Tikal fait partie des classiques). Vous allez construire des temples et des quartiers, pour avoir le plus d'influence. Chaque tour, 6 points d'action à repartir. Aucun sacrifice humain. A part ce dernier point, c'est une très belle ré édition !
Pour la petite histoire, Mexica fait partie d'une trilogie : Mexica, Tikal et Java, du même auteur. On y retrouve donc une mécanique semblable à partir de points d'actions

RATING: 8.5
Simple rules, yet there's a substantial tree of decisions with viable options.

Small pieces are better for locking others out of a district, whilst larger ones are better for gaining a foothold. All need to be used judiciously.

Board and pieces are pretty and easily readable. 

The game is short but provides a reasonably rich experience. 

Not the sheer number of variables to consider as in Die Macher/Power Grid but this is a simple game - I could imagine introducing this to relative non-gamers - with dome depth.

A somewhat abstract influence game, the biggest complaint I have is that it seems that the only good strategy is to block bridges at the end of your turn so that your opponents can't get in to the good district.  Not sure about the replayability but I'd try it again at least once.

RATING: 7
Clearly not a game for people with analysis paralysis but otherwise a deep influence-in-areas game with room for clever positional play (blocking other player's routes onto islands and keeping your options open). Timing your actions to fit the scoring and your opponents reactions is also a critical skill.
The board looks nice, but the plastic towers are very lurid!

The most elegant game of The Mask Trilogy and perhaps the best one (it's not that the other two are bad, this one is so good).

All this takes it right up my alley, and it goes without saying that the game is tight, exciting and full of agonizing decisions.

Here we play the early Aztecs founding Tenochtitlan on lake Texaco. The island on the lake is sub-divided into districts and "founded" (scoring points). Players build buildings into these districts for more points at the half way point, and again at the end of the game. Action points are expended to move your "builder" around, to found regions and construct buildings. Lots to like here, and very pretty to look at.

This is a pretty good game. Tikal is probably my favorite of the three, but what I like about this one relative to the others is the length. It's the quickest of the three while the other two can be quite long, especially Java. This game is also probably the lightest of the three. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What an elegant and beautiful game from both an artistic and aesthetic viewpoint, as well as from a mechanical one.  The rules and game play are so streamlined and intuitive they felt natural and everything perfectly balanced and logical.  Yet there is a lot of deep strategy in this game and it requires some serious thought.  However, that brings me to the only problem with this game: players who take too long to decide their turn (aka: Analysis Paralysis).  You need to play this game with the RIGHT people.  If players are too competitive or focus too much on always making the best possible move each turn (you have many to choose from), then the game will drag.  Honestly, you shouldn’t need more than 30 seconds on your turn.  Its rare that another players will do something that dramatically changes the board in such a way that all the strategies you were planning are suddenly ruined.  I guess a timer could be used to rectify this in competitive environments: perhaps something like a chess-clock could be used so that players lose points if their total decision-making time goes above a certain threshold or gain extra points for making decisions very quickly.  
Overall, a very enjoyable game if played with the right people.

Mexica is the type of game that really almost requires you to snuggle up deep into your opponents head... and then totally re-arrange the furniture.  I've only played w/ two players so far, but with two it's absolutely fantastic.  It's quite the knife fight.  Very tight, very tense.

I get the sense that with three or four players the game will morph into something a little different, and quite possibly be even more entertaining.  We'll see, I'll update my thoughts and ratings as I get this to the table more often (which I will).

I lost badly after making poor choices early on, but this game really works well. A mix of Manhattan and various tile games, the 6 APs really make you struggle. And yet, the ability to buy 2 APs for later use makes for interesting ideas. Do little early on and crash in later when you need to. And the bridge to bridge moves are ripe with possibilities. And the round ending conditions let you force an ending too. I think Mexica has to be a 4 player game, with 3 you've too much of one player getting a strong lead early on. As good as Tikal and better than Java in my book.

Played 1 time. Something about this third installment in the Ap trilogy, just didn't grab me. Part of it was the plastic buildings, part of it was the theme-bsting canal teleports (at least Java made some sense), and part of it was just a third installment after two stellar games (Java and Tikal). And yet, being objective and not comparing it to the others, this still rates a 7! But I would take Java first, Tikal second, Torres third, Mexica fourth.

RATING: 7
The most interesting and playable of the "mask" series.  The board which appears to be huge at first compresses  to a sweeping web of canals which makes quick jumps back and forth really easy.  This alone gets my interest as the strategies reveal themselves slowly as the island is divided in regions.  My main problem with the game is the swing it gives to the last player as that is the only certain position as far as scoring goes.  The others must build up a decent lead to be imprevious to a last turn rush to contest weak areas.  Not a showstopper but definitely something which could nag me through repeated plays.

RATING: 7
[Action Point Game, Tile-laying, Spatial, Area Majority] {4P:8, 3P:7, 2P:5} Excellent game, a worthy addition to the Action Point series. It's more challenging and has more depth than Tikal, and is faster and leaner than Java (though it lacks Java's amazing depth). The heart of the game is zipping your Mexica around the board in order to found neighborhoods and construct monuments. To enable your Mexica to do this, you need to set up  waterways (or use the ones set up by your opponents, which is even better). There's also a lot of opportunity to play defensively; blocking your opponents from big scores is an important part of the game. I'd rate Mexica as an excellent middleweight German game, around the same weight as Torres, but a bit less elegant and cool. That's ok, it's still cool enough to be in the collections of most German game fans. *** UPDATE: Ok, it's not that good with 2, but it's still good with 3 and it's very good with 4. That makes it the third-best game in a 4-title bunch in my book, and that's still pretty damned decent.

A worthy successor to Tikal and Java. It takes elements from both (and Torres) yet is a very different game. Despite the fact that it is an open information game and therefore calculable it seems to play a lot quicker than its siblings.

Spatial considerations when building districts or erecting pyramids are hugely important, much more so than in Tikal. Mexica is probably not as good with two or three players due to the implementation of the area majority scoring.

Another solid entry into the Mask Trilogy.  Mexica is a beautiful game to look at, simple to play, and plays just in the right amount of time. I really like the Action Point system Kramer & Kiesling have used in Tikal, Java and Torres and my enjoyment for this one is no different. This plays simpler than both those games but it still feels weighty enough to be worth the 60-90 minutes that are invested. And it's one of the more beautiful games to behold once it's been played out and a grand city of buildings is displayed before you!

Of the 4 games in the Mask series, I think this is the one I like least. It's mostly a game of moving around and placing buildings for majorities. There seem to be fewer clever moves than in Java, Tikal or Torres.

This is a fun game, but not as good as Tikal.  The actions of increasing the temple size, setting up camps and moving around the jungle are very satisfying in Tikal.  Here you can move too easily, and you don't build up the temples in the same way.  Still, the AP mechanism, cool components and competitive area control are a nice middle-weight balance.

This game is evil!  In a good way!  Lots of opportunity to mess with your opponent's plans.  Highly abstract - the theme could have been anything or nothing: it's a total paste-on.  Bits are fabulous.  It's an action point system where you move around the board and "do stuff" with your pawn.  Your pawn must be present to build in a district or to "found" a district, both of which bring points.  An area-majority game.  Could have Analysis Paralysis problems with the wrong people, but with only 6 AP and a very tactical opportunity window it moves along pretty well.

Very nice and very straight in mechanics and gameplay, but still - engaging and interesting area majority game. I really like it!
And the new edition! Wow! The components are top notch!

Year later, after finally playing 3 players game:
The game is though and is very much a game of chicken in the sense of:
do everything more efficiently than others, i.e. use others' work for your own benefit. And the game hurts sometimes. Especially at the end.
I like it, don't love it. A feel no real thrill playing it. Unfortunately. What is more - the game can drag a bit, when someone starts to rethinking his 6 moves.
Half of the fun of the game is how it looks (the new edition by G3/MrMeeple).
I suppose I'll be keeping it. I'll just see how much attention will it get in the next 6 months.

A wonderful and complementary game that completes the Mask Trilogy.

(only I traded Java) Obtained my used copy of Mexica in a trade that sent my copy of LotR Trilogy Risk (slightly regreting this), Quoridor and Sleuth.  Did I give away too much?  Mexica is a good game, and will get to the table a couple of time a year.

Mexica's appeal has only increased over time and I would play it given any opportunity, hence the "10" rating.

Probably my least favorite of the trilogy, but this is not a bad thing. The game is still very well done and a lot of fun, with lots of strategy to think about. The game bits are well made and look good and give the game a good appeal. I'm happy to finally own all three of the series.

This [i]might[/i] be better than [b]Tikal[/b].  It is certainly easier to teach and seems to play quickly with less optimization downtime.  There are less action points to worry about per turn, and, even better, you can save a couple APs between turns.  There is opportunity for some very clever positional play.  It doesn't have the exploratory aspect of [b]Tikal[/b], but the finished city is a sight to behold.

Like Tikal and Java, this game is beautiful to look at.  Of the 3, this one has the least theme, but that does not detract from the gameplay.  The very beginning of the game is the least interesting as you basically count squares and try to establish your first couple of territories.  After that has been completed and you work to establish your presence accross the board, the game really gets interesting.

Only played with 2, but I imagine choking your opponents out of power with canals would be even more cutthroat with additional players. Yet for some reason, the Mexica comes off as serene and enjoyable. Maybe it's the board. When the game is finished and the beautiful board is covered with plastic pyramids, it's probably the best looking game in my collection.

Just as good as the other two 'mask' games, but this one is more directly confrontational and more tactical. Reminds me a bit of Medina  with its need to always watch your back and be prepared to turn your opponents moves against them.

My first impression is very favorable.  The rules/mechanics are fairly simple and easy to learn, but there's plenty of depth to the gameplay.  Very nice production qualities as in all the 'mask' games.

This game is playable with my wife and nine year-old son and moves along nicely since we don't over-analyse.

I've upped my rating to a '9'.

After a few plays this is a great buy.  Worth every, "retail", penny.  It requires a great amount of tactics but not at the loss of time (doesn't bog down as much as others of this genre). Also it is easy to learn and teach! I'd pay full price for this... and did :-)  Get this for your collection.

Not having played Tikal or Java, I really enjoyed Mexica.  It was not as agonizing as I was expecting and had a cool spatial component.  Yes, there is an issue with the power of the person going last, but the game is still fun.  We liked being able to carry over a few action points from one turn to the next.  I think that cut down on analysis paralysis.

RATING: 8
The easiest of the Mask Trilogy, mostly because you only have to keep track of one playing piece.  That doesn't make this a light game, though; the balance between placing lots of small buildings to fill a district versus placing large buildings to get numeric advantage is pretty cool.  Plus, I just like the aesthetics of the board, as the city of Tenochtitlan slowly grows into full bloom.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Feels quite a bit like Tikal, but the games are totally different.  The main similarities are in appearance and that they are about area control.  Mexica, however, seems to go more quickly with less downtime, and has no luck factor.  Mexica is much more abstract than Tikal, but still immersive, and still a lot of fun neighbor-screwing.

It finally came to the table again and it hasn't lost any of it's charme! Great game in a great series, that can easily hack it's way through all those newer games.

While I like "Tikal", I like this one even more, even though I can't say why. Maybe because it's not as straight as "Tikal", as the whole board is open from the start. Doesn't matter anyway!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Low randomness without being intimidating. Gradually seeding the board with districts really gives a nice arc to the game, only gradually adding to the number of decisions and information to comprehend, even though the board is quite full and chaotic at the end. Area control element is fairly simple, made thoroughly interesting by the interaction with (very fun) tactical movement along the waterways, which I think may be the real heart of the game. Plays quickly, and the pieces are very appealing. The board does look good as the game progresses. I have only played with 4 players, I think the game may well suffer with less.

This is the third game of the Mask trilogy (of four if you include Torres) that I have played - and wow - what a game that encourages creative play! With 6 action points at your disposal every turn, there is so much you can do but never enough to do everything you want to; and the choices are agonizing (and the opportunities to make choices even more difficult for others through blocking seem endless). What starts off as a board full of what might be endless possibilities begins to fill up with canals (which also become possible waterways for incredible cross-board movement) and areas begin filling up (and some times locking down) with the colours of maize and squash. I suspect that this game might (as the poll might indicate) play better with more than less, the game provides good incentives for doing the dirty work of building areas up (such that I can see this still be good with 2 or 3). Overall, fantastic game.

RATING: 8
Pretty cool tactical game. Highly cut-throat, with players grabbing for territory each turn. Tile-laying, with majority control for scoring. The action point system can lead to play bogging down, but it's not that bad. The presentation of the new version is better than ever, with nice resin pyramids. Glad I finally got to play this, and hoping to play it more often.

I enjoyed playing this game, but the first few turns was super intimidating. You can literally build anything ANYWHERE, and the board is a blank island, giving no inclinations on where you should build.

Once people start building, it is less overwhelming. Do you want to found a new district for some points, or start building in somewhere to compete for majority? Just how many buildings do you need to plop down to discourage others from taking majority? Etc etc.

The movement via canals is very fun, tricky, and with poor planning can leave you in sticky situations. Thankfully there is always the option to "teleport anywhere", though it will take 5 actions (ie: almost your whole turn), so this isn't something you'll want to make a habit of doing.

Old school action points and area control. My cup of tea. This is more abstract than Tikal, and the theme that is pasted on is not as cool as Tikal's, but I think this may be the better game in terms of mechanics. Mexica's 6 action points are definitely more manageable than Tikal's 10, but the big improvement is that in Mexica you can save 1-2 action points from turn to turn and spend them later, so you avoid the thing in Tikal where a player figures out how they want to spend 8 of their points, then can't find anything good to do with the other 2, so they start the thinking process all over.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent relative of the popular Tikal and surprisingly different enough in play but with a lot less theme. You are still vying for majorities here but there are two very distinct rounds in Mexica for me; round 1 I like to call the 'establish phase' and round 2 the 'lock down' phase.  By establishing regions you get points automatically and then whoever has majorities in them will get points at the end of round 1 & 2. Much of round 1 is establishing regions while also placing buildings for majorites and much of round 2 is locking down regions completely hopefully giving yourself a majority that can't be messed with.  

This is slightly prone to AP as are all of these types but here with 6 AP points vs 10 in Tikal this moves faster and thus plays better with more than 2 at the table.  Blocking is very important in the game ensuring high interaction and some screwage and the use of the bridges for moving and blocking can be the key to winning.  It does feel a little bit lighter than Tikal but not much and that is partly due to the 6 vs 10 AP points, a great feature of this game however is the option to take and store actions for a later turn, it adds some great strategy.  A great game and no luck in this game just makes it even more desirable to play, probably best with 3 but good at all numbers and the only "Mask" game I will play with 4 (Tikal=2, Java=3, Mexica=4). 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Fell very flat with only 2, 3 and 4 both excellent though

While I don't really like Tikal, Mexica is enjoyable for me. The biggest improvement over Tikal is the reduction of the available action points per turn from 10 to 6 setting more reasonable limits to each turn. It further improves on it by replacing the all-or-nothing fight for temples with majority scoring for the first three places and it gets rid of the annoying random tile and treasure draw. The placement of canals leaves more opportunities for open development notwithstanding the reduced AP limit. At its core it's still a game of protecting your possession and choosing your battles wisely but one lost battle won't lose the game. For some it might suffer from its more abstract nature and drier gameplay but that's a matter of taste.

Very fun game, similar in some respects to others in the AP-quadrilogy probably mainly because of the plastic pieces (reminiscent of Torres) and the graphic design, especially on the player aid (reminiscent of the other "Mask Trilogy" games).  The board is very attractive and the river/canal tiles are very nicely done.  As the board becomes more populated, the landscape really looks kind of neat.  The game is pretty simple to learn, but still challenging.  It's not as frustrating to me as Tikal (probably because it seems easier to move around, and I feel like I'm acccomplishing more), but it's more on par with Torres (with perhaps a smidgeon less calculation), which I also really enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Its not as light as most people say it is. There's still a bit of thinking and planning involved. However, I don't find it as elegant as Tikal. The Action Point system seems to be pretty linear, and there isn't the multiple paths to victory that was present in the other Kiesling/Kramer games.

Overall, its a pretty good game. Middle-range, nice bits, nice art.

Old school area majority game. The first time I played was a bit chaotic. None of us knew what would be smart to do until we reached the midgame.

2016-01-17 - 7.5 - Pretty quick, awesome looking and just good area control game where you create areas to score while playing. I played only with three and it works very good with that number. It's even more abstract than area control games usually are but the looks make it up.

Nagyon örültem, amikor kiderült, újra kiadják a Mexicát. Sajnos a régit már sehol sem lehet beszerezni, így olyanok is játszhatnak vele most, akik nem 10+ évvel ezelőtt voltak rákattanva a társasozásra.
A kivitelezés kimagaslóan szépre sikerült, nagyon minőségi minden elem, gyönyörű látvany, ahogy épülnek a templomok, és egyre jobban elszaporodnak a táblán.
Tulajdonképpen egy területelkerítős, többségi birtoklás alapú játékról van szó, ahol akciópontokból gazdálkodunk. Szeretem ezt a mechanikát, mert nagy fokú szabadságérzetet, és ezáltal kontrollálást ad.
A kétfős szabály jól működik, kiélezett küzdelem zajlik kettesben is. A játékmenet nagyon konfrontatív, folyamatosan megpróbálunk a másik előtt kerületeket kialakítani, azok pomtszámát érvényesíteni, minél többet építkezni az értékesebb területekre. Ha azt akarod kockáztatni, hogy a párod soha többet ne akarjon játszani veled Mexicát, igazán szemét módon is lehet játszani...:D Úgyhogy csak óvatosan. :P

Acquired in 2002 or 2003 and only played once or twice. I enjoy Tikal a lot but I found Mexica uninteresting. (I've never tried Java.) Perhaps it needs more than one play to reveal it's goodness.

Great tactical action point building game, which is part of the Mask Trilogy (Java-Tikal-Mexica). Of these three, the easiest game to learn and fastest to play, but nevertheless it offers a fun and engaging experience. Anticipate the creation of a large district in the second phase of the game (either block the creation or get in first). As starting player, make sure to build as fast as possible the largest districts and gain those points. Don't forget to try to get back to one of the starting positions at the end of the game.

RATING: N/A
Mexica plots the development of the city of Tenochtitlan on an island in lake Texcoco. Players attempt to partition it into districts, place buildings, and construct canals.

Districts are formed by completely surrounding areas of the island with water and then placing a District marker. The player who founds a district scores points immediately.

Canals and Lake Texcoco act as a quick method of moving throughout the city. Players erect bridges and move from one bridge to the next, which costs 1 action point regardless of the distance. They must also erect buildings. This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the building's size.

Too damn dry. I don't really feel the theme, the mechanics could be applied to any theme and it wouldn't affect the game at all. Even the mechanics are boring, Tikal pulled it off by appliying lots of variables to the game, but the "majority rules" in Mexica are mostly useless, you get into an empy spot, you build something and next turn someone comes and claims your well earned points. Take out the greatly sculped pyramids and the awesome board and replace them with a blank grid and with colored tiles and you end up with nothing but a failed attempt to make a game.

I love action point games, and Mexica definitely is a good one.  There's a lot of fluidity to the game, making it important to plan ahead even though you may need to reinvent your turn as soon as it begins.  The area control aspects are tricky, since fighting for a district sometimes is a forgone loss (especially if you leave that district, opening up another square for a temple), but choosing where you score your points (making districts vs controlling districts) is the crux of the game.

This game is a gem.  It's a wonderful mix of abstract, area control, and strategic planning.  Add to the mix that everything must be done with a single roaming worker (Pili).  This game is a lot of fun and the pieces are fantastic (stone-like resin).  It's easy to learn, but difficult to master because as your opponents grow in skill, you have to adapt.  This game is quickly becoming one of the first games I pull out with a new group of gamers OR a group of long time gamers.  Good job Mexica.

Stunningly gorgeous game.  Plays well, and it's not too difficult to learn.  Two player games are fairly quick and score high, while a four player session does take a little more time.

An ok action point game.  I like the feeling of building the board as you play.  Not quite the masterwork of Tikal, but still enjoyable.  My slight issue with the game is that everyone has all of the same pieces to place and the same number of turns - therefore the scores will be very close in the end.  The game was more tactical than strategic and even then was somewhat limiting - since you only have one mexica.  Maybe if each player had two mexicas - the strategy could open up.

Rating based on 4 players.

Since the game is often compared to Tikal, I'll say I prefer Tikal, but Mexica also has its own charms. The game is easy to explain, with lots of cut-throat decisions to make, and is very think-y, but Tikal is more free-flowing (the element of luck in Tikal helps keep the game light) and feels more varied. This game feels more similar to Torres in that it's much more static, and due to how areas are scored there is a sense that once you're behind it's extremely difficult to get back in the game.

Sold it. It's a nice game, but not one I saw myself actively suggesting to play.

Clean and streamlined--I can see how it is a Kramer/Keisling game. The components in the 2016 Super Meeple edition are pretty awesome (resin temples). It's a fine game.

04/09/11 Played a three-player game. I liked the look of the game, and its components. The icons on the player aid were clear. There can be a some analysis paralysis when trying to find just the right combination of canal tiles to cordon off an area, or finding the least expensive route to an area to build a temple. But it wasn't too bad. I look forward to trying a "crowded" four player game.

Played it couple of times and can say I find it very good. Really good with 4 players.

Update : Still a very fine game, I like Torres a little more, droped the rating from 9.5 to 9

Good with 2 players using the variant.
Very good with 3 players.
Best with 4 players.

Another impressive K&K action-pointer which feels original even though it's just another area-control game.  Players each have 6 action points to spend but play doesn't bog down as points are usually spent in a combination of one move.  Players can found a district, add to a canal, add a bridge, move or build (the buildings come in different sizes and each floor to the building placed costs an action point & counts for a control point in that district.  The game excels because of both the defensive considerations (much fun in blocking your opponents after they've spent action points moving to a paricular district) and that the entire board is scored twice (halfway through and at the end of the game) so buiding that occurs in the first round is culmulative.

I had ranked this as 8.5, but after repeated plays, I have dropped it to a 6.  That doesn't mean it's a bad game --- on the contrary, it's well designed with clear rules and an appealing setting.  However, it is also extremely tactical and not a game I feel I have much success at.  So I admire it, but don't enjoy it.

The kinship with Tikal and Torres is obvious- this is another great action point game.  I've only been able to play it once, but I think it might be my favorite of the three.  My one game was quick and strategic- I'd love to play again.  Unfortunately I don't own this game or live near anyone who does, and I'm not really sure that it is worth having this, Torres, AND Tikal given their similarity.

RATING: 9
This game is a beautiful dance that grows ever more complex as the board fills up.  It has a lovely build up that starts with the blank page... then plans start to form and finally all the bits start bouncing off the walls as the players push and shove each other around the very crowded board (or watch while others push and shove while quietly gathering points all over).  I love the easy rule-set, the variety of ways the game has played out, and the great conversations that have spun around this beautiful game.

Only played it twice. The rulebook isn't the best. The rules kind of left out a few things (such as everything stays on the board between the two halves of the game). It is VERY cutthroat; so much that I don't think we'll play it often. The player components are awesome!

Haven't played this game as much as I'd like to, but the few times I did I enjoyed it a lot. It has movement, canal building and area majority. The components are beautiful. The major drawback is that it doesn't work that well with 2, although it's playable. Also, since it's a perfect information game, it can be prone to AP.

Meilleur que Tikal à mon goût: Aucun hasard, éléments tactiques (blocages, déplacements de ponts, poses de canaux...) plus présents, caractéristiques du plateau en constant changement, moins de pertes de temps à déplacer nos "ouvriers" (1 Mexica vs 18 Archéologues), plus grande créativité possible car plus grande liberté d'action (possibilité de déplacer d'un endroit à un autre du plateau notre Mexica, ou de poser n'importe où sur le jeu des canaux...) 

J'ai découvert Tikal et Mexica avec deux joueurs qui eux-aussi les découvraient en même temps que moi. Si le temps de réflexion a peut-être été un peu plus long pour Mexica, il était plus facile et donc plus agréable de réfléchir durant le tour de nos adversaires.

Cependant le jeu requiert de bien lire le jeu, de bien calculer les possibilités adverses, et de s'adapter rapidement à la nouvelle situation lorsque c'est à nouveau notre tour pour jouer.

EDIT: J'ai finalement réussi à jouer une première partie de Java. Si je ne suis pas prêt à noter Java, je suis prêt à dire que Mexica est mon préféré de la trilogie.

In Mexica, one uses their action points to build bridges, temples or move tokens into regions. An area control game, areas are only scored when a certain number of hexes are sealed off. Only played once with 3 players, but it was fun.

RATING: 5
Few days after the first play, I got it as a birthday present. As an AP system game, I like it slightly more than Torres as it is cleaner. It plays better with 4 than 3, but downtime is shorter with 3, of course. Tikal might be a bit better game but I haven&#039;t played either of them enough to say.

I am a big fan of this game. As good as abstract area control games come. No luck-element, medium-heavy (just right) and a good doze of fun and competitive spirit between players. I have, however, almost never won a game (but I'm sensing progress in every game). Be vary though not many in my game group actually likes this one, 'too clinical' (they prefer Tikal) for them. An acquired taste. For full review see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/170031]here[/url]

Luckless game with perfect information, fairly high on the abstract scale;  not too long, but long enough for people like me, who aren't masters at such things, to "get it" and be contenders.  The theme and graphic design are great, but the color choices (white, yellow, orange, brown) are pretty poor;  I guess they wanted earthy tones for these ancient buildings.  (But then, why is everything else blue?)

A second playing confirmed my initial thoughts - this is an awesome game and is now firmly rooted in my top 10. Give me more, please! **UPDATE** Though I won't lower my rating, there is a condition that breaks the game.

After playing Tikal and rather enjoying it I was quite looking forward to giving either this or Java and this did not disappoint. Although this is a very different game from Tikal it is still in essence an area control affair whilst also adding some nice tile placement and building elements into the mix. On the hole it is fairly difficult to truly assess a game after just one play but if I were made to (and I sorta am) I would say that this is a what you see is what you get game and what you'll see is a good solid game that looks as though it should be good fun.

RATING: 7
Of the 'Mask Trilogy', I'm torn over which is my favorite, Mexica or Java. 

I'm not a fan of Area Influence, but in Mexica if you work with the smaller areas only, its possible to secure them so they aren't available to be re-invaded. I also don't like Action Point-oriented gameplay where different actions cost different amounts of Action Points. I find it causes AP and is difficult to keep track of how many points other players are spending. In Mexica most actions are a single point, so it is pretty easy to plan out and track.

Nice components in this new edition of Mexica, but I prefer the old box cover over the new cartoon one. Without the big mask, how are people to know that it is part of the Mask Trilogy?

Build more pyramids than your fellow players in as many districts as possible and create new districts by enclosing areas as you go along, within the action point system's limitations. This game is just as AP prone as Tikal, but a little bit faster.

RATING: N/A
Even with the number of action points you have, there is always a little more you'd like to do on your turn. Taking turn tokens early in the game might be a good strategy, since you can make a push later on once the board is developed.

A textbook case of area influence, which in this game is pursued through action points and tile laying. Very abstract, to the point of making the game a bit dull. Progresses at a nice pace, though, since the game does not generate excessive analysis paralysis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an excellent game, but can be a real brain burner. So many options all the way through the game and the best course of action is never obvious. Opportunities to mess with the others players gives it player interaction. Plays well with 3 players. (8)

Of the 3 mask series games this one is in the middle; Tikal being the best and Java the worst.  I'll caveat that I like the mechanics of Java but do not enjoy playing the game (it's a puzzle not a game).  Mexica uses 6 AP per player and a ton of choices but not defined enough that you try to run every combination and suffer from AP like in Java.  But it doesn't play as fast as Tikal either.  The entire game plays fast though.  I enjoy it but prefer Tikal.

[b]Mexica[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Mexica is another game I've had on my radar for a while; one because it's a Kramer/Kiesling design and two, the beautiful new production by Super Meeple. I have a feeling we may have gotten a rule wrong since we ran out of bridges early and didn't realize we could move them. However; this lead to our game being downright nasty. It was a 4p game and we played an extremely cut throat, screw your buddy game which probably lead to some sub optimal moves but it was a blast. As can happen in area control games, there was one player who seized control and never gave it up, but it was our fault for not collectively doing enough to knock him down a few pegs.

If I had one knock against the game it was the ability to hoard the extra action tokens. Being able to play a handful of those can be absolutely devastating, but on the other hand I realize you need to give up actions to take them. It just seems like there are moments during the game where those actions are much more beneficial. It was by no means a huge deal, I'm just curious why there isn't a limit on how many of those one player can have.

This is the first game in the mask trilogy I've played and now I'm really looking forward to trying the others. I'm especially interested in Tikal which seems to be regarded as the best of the bunch and my buddy that owns Mexica also has a copy of the Super Meeple edition of Tikal.[/i]

This one was rather lackluster. Fantastic components and beautiful art, but the gameplay just wasn't exciting. Traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the game: It's a pretty simple tile placement, area-control game that is fairly abstract in essence. It's also fairly dry to play. But the board's beautiful, the pieces lend some sense of theme and aesthetics, and one does have to think. I also like that once you understand how to place and move, the game plays relatively quickly, which is good, because this isn't a real involved game and you wouldn't want it to take too long to play out. 

For me, a longer learning curve than that for "Tikal," even though obviously there are similarities in the designs of both. Also, I wish the company hadn't skimped on cost and included the plastic temples, which look hokey, especially in the gawdier colors. But the board is nice and the tile pieces are just fine. 

Played through for the first time (Oct. 2007) to get a handle on the rules. The hardest part for me to keep in mind were the rules concerning movement of Mexica, although the diagrams in the rulebook are helpful. 

One thing I like about the design is that there are a limited number of buildings one can employ in each of the two parts of the game, so players have to make difficult decisions about when and where to place buildings in order to maximize their scores. 

Traded, October 2010.

One day I woke up and decided I was bored to death by this trilogy of games, so I sold them and haven't missed them since. Personally not a huge fan of action point type games, although I do love that "AP" is shorthand both for "action points" and "analysis paralysis." Verrry slow during play.

An appealing game of maximising your action points where you get to create your own territories before it turns into a majorities game. The end-game can be taut, especially if the water is getting close to running out. Will someone take the plunge (ahem), plop all the water out and splurge away on building in the big remaining void where it's a point a square? One of the majorities games I like because of the added elements.

As a two player game, it is good but a little too open. Since the number of districts to be made is the same regardless of the number of players, it becomes almost a race and there is little back and forth since a player can use up all their buildings pretty fast and once all the districts are built and one player runs out of buildings, the game ends. Also, since there are only 2 players, only the first and second points score, leading again to less confrontation. In a three player game and especially a four player game there is much more confrontation and once a district is built, there are fights within it almost throughout the game (especially for the larger, higher valued districts). As a two player game, it is okay, but as a four player game, it is quite good.

RATING: 7
Classic area control game where players carve out districts and attempt to dominate them with their temples.  Movement seems to be more important in this game than other games in the mask series as you only have one worker/noble and he needs to be in so many places at once.  Hence, I think it is a more dynamic game than Tikal, Torres, or Java as in those titles, workers will often find a place to roost. That said, I prefer both Tikal and Torres. In Mexica, at least at the beginning of the game, is very wide open and players can get stuck in a bad AP loop since there is little to no guidance as how to proceed. On the flip side, with a few plays under your belt, the first couple of moves can get very routine (first move: lay a canal, build a bridge, hop on bridge, take two extra tokens, and perhaps lay one more canal).  I am also a bit undecided on the banking extra action token mechanic.  I see why it was added to the game , but waiting for someone to puzzle through a monster turn can be disruptive to the game flow.  Still, it's a good game, just not one I reach for very often.

Mexica is a no-luck area majority game with lots of creative potential.  Its a possible chess-replacement game.

There are numerous tactical hijinks to find in your options each turn.  Mexica is also a very good looking game, for those who care.  I love the colors in this game, and the look of the bits, though I don't usually care for plastic.  It plays quicker and smoother than Tikal.

This is one of the few games I regret selling. Maybe I'll get another copy some day. It is by far my favorite of the Mask series from Kramer and Kiesling.

I have all three in the "triad" - this is the worst. It isn't broken, or terrible - but there are many better choices for your dollar. Don't let the pretty colors/graphics charm you into this game - Here's the biggest reason: your time is much better spent mastering a Settlers variant, Puerto Rico, or anything in the Top 50. It is very low on the fun-per-hour meter of time invested to learning and playing. - UPDATE/Played once the other day with son. Marginally enjoyable, will try again. Updated to 5.

Another engaging brain burner in the family of Tikal, Java, and Torres.  Mexica is a little less heavy than Java or Tikal but no less prone to analysis/paralysis than Tikal. Although, I think the level of A/P associated with this game series is exaggerated    Mexica shares many elements with the other games in the family: it uses the action point system and tile laying similar to Tikal and to a lesser degree Java. As in Tikal, Mexica is a great tactical area-control game but with a little more chaos caused by player actions and a smaller universe of options per turn.

This is a very interesting area control game because players are in charge of dividing up the land on the board into score-able regions themselves. They get bonus points for being the one to declare a region done, and the scoring part for having the most temples only happens twice per game. Where you are allowed to build is also determined by a pawn that represents you on the board, and moving that pawn is a major feature of the game, as you can try to block or get in the way of other players with your placements.

Mexica made for an interesting comparison to Tikal and Torres (I haven't played Java yet).

Interesting action points allowance system, blended with tile laying and area control. You are trying to create areas to lay claim on certain districts and earn VP for control. Though as any area control game goes, you spend most of your time in convincing others you are not winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A reasonably challenging area control game. I can see the mask trilogy reference. I've played Tikal and it feels similar, using action points and the split between move and build. However, there are difference, this is more straight up area control. I like how the areas are fenced off dynamically by the players as the game progress, the area control temples are fixed once built are fixed, some action points can be banked. It is interesting that the canals while fencing an area also provide the most efficient way of movement. There is some decision points as to whether to build more temples to control areas or found a new area to get its bonus.
The Iello reprint is a nice production with the resin temples, glad to see a classic Euro being reprinted, another game that looks good on the table  
Personally I think I like Tikal better, but I would be willing to play Mexica again.

RATING: 6
Note that I don’t like area influence games to begin with.

I find the districts in Mexica too hard to defend. That's why I have such a hard time playing first (especially in a two player game). My opponent can easily gain control of any district over which I have control. As a result, I have to control the pace of the game, building buildings in unfounded districts, focusing my efforts on the medium and smaller districts, and making sure that all the districts are founded as quickly as possible so that I will have placed more buildings than my opponent by the end of each scoring round. This kind of tension is great; my problem is that there's far more tension for the first player than the second. There doesn't seem to be the same sense of urgency for the second player. As a result, it feels like we're playing two different games.

This was a fun game to play.  Must think through placement of rivers creating areas to control and deny areas.  Across board moves which are costly and use valuable points.  It is best to use river movement to conserve points.  Remember to save points for final jump back to starting position for bonus points.

Reminiscent of Torres, the game begins simple and quickly creates a vast number of options to consider with each turn as the complexity of the playing field increases.  I enjoy games with vast complexity of options much more than ones with very limited options (which one of these five things will I get, on 6 turns before the game is over, for example, is not very satisfying).  I'd say this is a very good game, and will probably grow on me even more when I play it again.

"This is a great game, yet somehow I never seem to want to play it. Why is that?" 

Jesse Miller made this comment, and I have to back it up. Enjoyed the game, far less downtime than I had feared, easy to learn and some good tactical decision making.

The problem is I have a strange disinterest is getting it back on the table. I think it has the same problem as Torres - every game is going to feel repetitous. There's just not that much to do. Place temples, teleport around the island and wait until you can take over someone else's region on the sly. A little too uncontrollable. I'd play again, and it is better than Torres and faster than Tikal, but I won't be suggesting it too often.

I think Tikal is a better game, but this is my favorite of the mask trilogy. A fluid "create your own area to control" spin on the genre. The board looks gorgeous as  it starts to fill up. The action point system allows for some brilliant strategic play. Overshadowed by the novelty of mechanisms found in Tikal, and the elusive rarity of Java.

RATING: 7
--Feb2006-- This seems like the love child of Manhattan and Tikal.  Fairly amusing for all that; the six action points don't cause me quite as much paralysis as afforded by Tikal.
--Feb2010-- My worry here is that there's not much to the game other than a greedy local optimization.  I've yet to see much other than score-what-you-can/limit-your-opponents-opportunities.  Rinse.  Repeat.
Well, either that or I've just been lucky in my first two games; it's hard to know.
--Jan2017-- Sold last year with Java.  I'd reacquire Java (at the right price) happily; but probably wouldn't bother with Mexica.

My second experience in the "Mask Trilogy". I enjoyed "Tikal" a bit more but "Mexica" also does it very well with its action point system. Not very complicated rules, rather abstract in theme but with wonderful components. And to see how Teotitlán is rising and getting more and more crowded is one of the great things here. You have to think about making the most victory points by yourself and at the same point hinder your opponents by chopping their way for example. Moving over the canals is a really interesting mechanic in this game.

A few more plays will probably influence my rating, but I have no idea in which direction at this time.

The least random of the series (see Tikal, Java), but tenseley entertaining.  9/10 is a provisional score from me, as I&#039;ve only played 3 times, but I&#039;m liking Mexica more and more each time.  I can&#039;t see this game (or any of the series) working with just 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In Tikal the decision space starts out narrow and widens as you add more workers and tiles to explore until it reaches its zenith in the end game. Java's decision space starts out as wide or wider than Tikal's final state and remains pretty much constant throughout due to its vertical placement options. And, finally, Mexica's decision space starts out wide open and slowly narrows as more and more of the board becomes sectioned off by canals and locked down into districts. Looking at the series in this way, you can begin to see why people may suggest that Java would be the most AP prone of the lot: in Tikal, AP potential appears to rise as the number of options available rises due to increases in the number of workers and cleared jungle tiles; in Java, it starts high and remains fairly constant from beginning to end; and, in Mexica, it seems to slowly decrease, but never disappear, as the game wears on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game of multiple options with limited actions. I was wary of the action point system and AP, however, there are only a few options for each turn so this game wasn't affected much. 
There are so many ways to make points during the game that you are never really out of it. If you are thinking about Tikal, but are afraid of the potential AP, try out Mexica.

Only one play and was a 2p game. I generally prefer more players in this style of game the whole head-to-head relative-scoring calculatory thinkiness never quite appeals to me.

Fairly dry, lots of options, bit of a think-fest.  Game sped up as we went along due to the board shrinking and options starting to get a bit limited.

Enjoyed the play though, but can see that it could bog down to an insane level with the wrong crowd.  From what I saw I reckon there'd be more AP than with Tikal.

Boards and bits are great.

[3 plays] Apparently I am predisposed to love Kramer's action point games, because here is another that became an instant hit for me. Mexica is beautiful, the game plays quickly, objectives are clear so AP is limited, and opportunities for clever play and confrontation are abundant. For me, that makes for a great game - for those who don't enjoy direct confrontation, Mexica might not go well. 

I suspect this would be just as enjoyable with 3 or 2 as it was with 4. Only my personal guideline keeps me from rating Mexica a 10 after just one play.

Most recent play at GameCamp 2013.

RATING: 6
The weakest themed but least paralysing of the Action Point trilogy. Players have 6 APs to try to move their pawn around the board to either places influence (temples of different point values) or enclose areas (to score). There are 2 scoring phases with players scoring for majorities.

Very pretty game but didn't really excite me.

Somehow this became the redheaded stepchild of the mask trilogy.  I really find this design to be elegant and cruel.  I love it.  There is a wonderful sense of movement to the game, and so many great option to really screw people.  The great thing is that this is much more reasonable than Tikal.  Sure you want to maximize your position, but sometimes you want to wait it out as well.  

It really pushes area control to a whole new level as you scoop out territory to score. I think this is a beautiful, elegant design, and really deserves much more credit than it gets.  I suspect my rating will go up with more plays.

  I have been Game Master of this game for the past two years at the WBC and have yet to win a single game in competition. I'm still learning the nuances of its strategy and tactics. Players like Arthur Field and Mario Lanza (2003 and 2004 winners, respectively)are much better at this than I am, but it is the very existence of this learning curve that keeps me coming back for more. It can be taught quite easily to a 10-year-old, yet mastery of the aforementioned nuances can (obviously, in my case) take quite some time. I've never played its design predecessors (Tikal & Java), but see myself returning time and again to this game to continue the learning process. Terrific game. Well worth whatever you pay for it.

Mexica plays a lot like other Kramer/Kiesling games. It's an area control game where players are given a handful of action points each turn to spend on a menu of actions in the most efficient manner possible. I find that action point games often lead to analysis paralysis, but Mexica goes fairly quickly, so, for now, it's my favourite in the genre. The ability to "bank" your action points for future turns facilitates quicker play. There's some mean blocking and parasitism here.

bit of a provisional rating which may go up a little, but I feel it's pretty solid.  This is a very good game with very simple rules and gameplay but with deep strategy lightened by some good tactical moves.

Yhis should be far from non-interactive as there are lots of ways to get your opponents to spend more action points than they'd like.

There is minimal overt randomness, but what prevents it from being too dry is the ability to "save" some action points each round.  This adds both direct randomness as well as pressure from the teleport ant build action.

So far I've only played with 3.

I've played plenty of games of "Tikal" and "Torres", and while I still prefer both of them over "Mexica", I definitely find this one to be a very intriguing game.  In "Tikal" you have the luck of the tile draw and the treasure exploration, in "Torres" you have the luck of the card draw, but in "Mexica" the luck factor is nearly non-existent.  On the one hand, this makes for a more purely strategic game, but on the other hand it also makes it slightly drier and a little less exciting.  But like the other 2 games, it definitely shines in that a fairly simple concept has been turned into a very cool game experience for 4 players (I've never played with less than 4, and I can't imagine it would make for a very good 2-player game).  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

Mexica is an amazing game. It may be the best of the Mask Trilogy (havent played Tikal yet), as it seems K&K took the best parts of the previous two games and streamlined them into the awesomeness that is Mexica.

Finally bought on eBay after being on the watch list for ages; still to play though...

We really liked Tikal and this is similar, but almost opposite, according to this abridged summary:

"In Tikal the decision space starts out narrow and widens as you add more workers and tiles to explore until it reaches its zenith in the end game.  Mexica's decision space starts out wide open and slowly narrows as more and more of the board becomes sectioned off by canals and locked down into districts.  AP potential appears to rise as the number of options available rises due to increases in the number of workers and cleared jungle tiles so in Mexica, it seems to slowly decrease, but never disappear, as the game wears on.

one of Kiesling+Kramer's great Mask Cycle games
Not quite sure yet what I think about how it plays.

+ cool Aztec theme of building Tenochtitlan
+ interesting game mechanics (placing canal tiles to found districts of specified sizes, area control by placing temples, saving action points for future use)
+ action point system
+ good materials (original version)
+ looks great (even with original version)
0 cutthroat ?
- gameplay seems a bit odd (only one player piece, blocking & teleporting, moving bridges, ...) !?

(Reprint looks better - especially the temples - but is much more expensive.)

Got this game in trade, and while I've not played my copy, because I had read my rules, I have gotten to play two games of this at the CMU board game club.

This is an interesting take on the area majority genre.  Because the areas are not formed until the players form them, there are many interesting choices to make.  At the same time, this feels lighter to me than Tikal, and definitely lighter than Java, so I think of the three mask games, it's the easiest one to get people to play.

A couple of issues.

First is that the game can end if the supply of canal tiles runs out. If someone gets a good lead then they can easily just spend entire turns grouping a bunch of canal tiles into a section in order to end the game.

Another thing is that the game needs exactly four players. With three players, two players fighting for different spots can easily hand the game to the other player. This might get better with more experience, but the game wasn't good enough for me to want to explore it further.

One of the "Mask Trilogy" by Michael Kiesling and Wolfgang Kramer. Others include Java. Of which, the only other one I've played has been Tikal thus far.

Absolutely gorgeous game. Really cool-looking pieces! They are resin and painted to give the (very convincing) appearance of being actual stone. Not only is this perfect for the theme, it looks really impressive on the table, as if you went out and bought real stone pieces to pimp the game out. (publishers take note: there is a definite demographic out there of gamers like me that want beautiful, mature looking components, and have no interest in, let alone the time or skills required for, painting or customizing the game ourselves). The rest of the components are great, too. Wooden bridges, meeples, and great quality tokens. They did something really cool with the token area for the districts that can be formed for a round where it has this really great 3 dimensional feel. Nicely done all around.

The only complaint I have there is stylistic: if they had made the colors less vivid and given a more "realistic" or antiquated look to the map, it would have fit the pieces better. As it is, the realistic feeling pieces are a slight aesthetic clash with the map and board's more cartoonish art. Really a small gripe. The production value for the cost of the game is ridiculously high. If you get this the first thing you'll notice is how hefty the box is... feels like money well spent in the hands!

Those comments are for the 2015 version, which is the only way to go in my opinion.

Very quick to learn and has a well-written rule book. The rules impress me because they both give you a prose explanation of the game (drenched in theme and including lots of examples to clearly illustrate almost any possible situation), and makes great use of PICTURES (publishers: take note, a picture is worth 1,000 words, and often saves us from many misinterpretations). But the rules also have great summaries and a "quick start" sheet on the back page for easy reference. Player aids are also great, as the only tricky thing with this game is knowing all the actions, how many action-points they cost, and how they can/can't be used.

I liked this quite a bit better than Tikal, though it bares some resemblance. I like the spatial aspect of trying to carve out districts and then claim them, then out-bidding each other by trying to dominate that district with the biggest/most temples. Creates some simple, but never-the-less interesting problems and tactical decisions as well as a few strategic dilemmas that make the mark of a thoughtful game, which I think this is.

Finally got to play this one long after first coming to its close relative Tikal (of which I am still a fan despite tiring of some other cube pushing euros). Mexica is another action point/area majority game, but with some nice differences. Most notably, I liked the fact that there is more insight into and player control of timing of the scorings. I also liked the way the scoring areas can fill up and the fact that even second or third place can be worth fighting for (as opposed to Tikal tending toward two player battles over temples).  After only one play, I'm not sure which I prefer but it is close enough that I'd consider them roughly equally. Like Tikal, I suspect that Mexica is clearly best with four players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Neat game.  I'm not that high on Tikal, but the action point/area majority is fun in this game.  It reduces the playing time, removes the dryness, adds take that, and makes a highly enjoyable game.  Definate surprise hit for me on this one.  I was not expecting much, I'm glad I had a chance to play this gem.  If Domaine and Tikal had a baby, this would be the game.   Mind you I'm absolutely horrible at this game, so it has to be fun to be willing to sit through an auto loss.(tied for 3rd maybe)

Another entry in the Mask series by Kramer and Kiesling, but not one that compares to the other two.  It's not nearly as interesting as Java, and not quite as good as Tikal either.  Mexica is more a straight-up area control game where you create areas of varying sizes with point values based on the size of the area, and then everyone can build buildings in those areas, with essentially whoever has the most buildings there controlling the area and scoring the points, and the person with the second-most buildings getting half the points.  It doesn't present the same interesting decisions that Java, Tikal, and Torres all do, but instead is an area control that can't compare to the other great area control games like El Grande, San Marco, and Louis XIV.  Maybe a decent introductory area control game and a decent introduction to the action-point system, but not a great game at either, so it may just turn people off to both genres, rather than getting them interested in the better area control games or the better action point games.

I'd never played this game. I only got into the hobby in 2010 and this came out almost a decade before that. I knew it was an older game, but nothing else. The version I played was a recent reprint, which is absolutely beautiful, with a lovely board and chunky heavy stone pyramids.

The game is part of the "Mask" trilogy of games by Kramer/Kiesling which use action point allocation. In this one, you're using action points to carve up the terrain by use of waterways (which scores points if you hit certain size regions), move around (usually plodding through a space for a point unless you use waterways to semi-teleport) or place your monuments (laying claim, or trying to, to the points of that region.

The game is played in two phases. In the first phase you only get some of your pyramids. Players start carving out appropriately sized parcels of land, and then building pyramids in them. There's a first, second and third place for each region but first is much higher than second which is higher than third. When all the "region tokens" have been created (by making the matchin size parcel) and when at least one player places all their pyramids, you do a scoring round. Then you put out a new batch of "region tokens" and do it again.

At the end of the second round the game ends and you score again. The pyramids from the first round stay through the second round, and all the original parcels from round 1 will score again in the second round. There's a bonus in each round if you make it back to the starting spot. At game end, any pyramids in undefined regions will score 1 point per space in that region (which would be huge).

The game becomes a fierce competition to gain and keep control of different regions. The high point ones will be fought over. You don't want to spend a lot of your pyramids just to take second place, so you have to judiciously pick and choose your battles. This game can be very thinky. I liked it a lot.

In [thing=2955][/thing] players spend action points (6 per turn) in order to do stuff on the board. There are several possible actions, but the most common will be:
- build a canal (1ap);
- build a bridge (1ap);
- move the Pilli (1ap por space);
- build buildings (1 to 4ap - depending on the size/influence of it);
- save up to 2ap for use later.

Basically in the game players are isolating areas, by adding canals to the board, in order to beign able to found districts, as this will earn players points. The size of the district must be equal to the big number on one of the district tokens. The bridges serve for the Pilli to move around (is possible to go from one bridge to other if they are connected by water). Move the Pilli is necessary as the player can only fund a district or put influence buildings if his Pilli is in the area. And the buildings are what influence districts - at the end of the two phases, each district will score accordingly to the district token on it: the person with the most influence gains the highest number on the token, the person in second, the second highest, and the third, the lowest number.

At the end of the first phase (it ends when all available districts - eight in total - are built) all the districts are scored. At the end of the second phase (also ends when all the district tokens are used or when a player has put all his buildings on the board), all the districts will be score again, but also all the enclosed areas in which districts weren't funded - they will score accordingly to their size (the same that happens with the normal districts). The player with the most points wins!

[thing=2955][/thing] has a minimal set of rules, but with a good depth of strategy. I was afraid that [thing=2955][/thing], like [thing=54][/thing], would lead players to a huge amount of AP, with them calculating every move, to min-max the crazy out of that 6 actions points. Room for this [thing=2955][/thing] do have, however, their options are so clear and easy to apply that I didn't see AP happening, as there are no gray areas do push or explore.

[thing=2955][/thing] lives the experience in the hands of the players, which are totally in control - there is no influence of luck in the gameplay, as the only random part of it, the draw of the district tiles for the first phase (the second phase uses the tiles that didn't show up in the first phase, so this is predictable), but since these are revealed in the set up, all players are aware of them before the first move of any player.

The play is fluid, even fast going, and we, in three players, finished in around 75 minutes.

The pieces of the new edition (I think is Iello's edition in the US) are great - everything have a high standard, and the crown jewels are the influence buildings, which are made of solid resin, and are awesome to handle (and heavy, these things will sustain a lot) - it is clear that good deal of the budge of the game was used in the buildings.

In a dispute between [thing=2955][/thing] and [thing=54][/thing] the result is complicated to give. [thing=54][/thing] is a more complex game, richer in options and, because of these, heavier and harder to teach and play well, so, it is more difficult to put it in the table.
[thing=2955][/thing] is much easier to explain and play, and even in a first play one can feel like he is playing well enough - thus, the probability of [thing=2955][/thing] beign played is greater. So, while I believe that [thing=54][/thing] is better for veteran players, [thing=2955][/thing] will attract a bigger set of players and be welcome in more groups.

Overall, [thing=2955][/thing] has been widely approved. Is a strong title that reinforces the quality of the Mask trilogy from Kiesling & Kramer. This gets me excited thinking how good must be the last of the trilogy that I haven't played: [thing=855][/thing].

[Rated 2005/05/07 based on 1 play]

Started out with all of us (four first-time players) with very little idea what to do, but quickly got the hang of it.

Twists and turns well, especially as the board fills up towards the end and two if not three of your cunning plans will have been shot down by the other players between one turn and the next.

Didn't have tons of fun on my one play of this. There were several turns near the end of phase 1 where I felt like I had no meaningful actions. In addition, I have a tough time with area majority control in general, so that also stripped some fun away. Add in some silliness with the bridges and it didn't totally do it for me.

another of the mask trilogy by kramer and friend.It has deceptive depth and the fast canal movement is a real bonus .Those extra action chips are vital and founding areas gives points "in game" , a excellent game and jolly good fun in which you can screw your buddies .tip sit on a bridge at the end of your turn if possible.

This is a terrific game, 2 or 3 player, haven't played with 4. We really enjoy this, it hits a sweet spot in light complexity and take-that competitiveness, although it runs just slightly long, maybe. It runs right at the edge of being "calculable" ("this turn would give me 6 points, that one would give me 8, so that one is just plain better, let me see if I can add up anything even better..."), but that sort of simplistic approach mostly does give way to more intuitive tactical and strategic thinking--particularly since we don't play it THAT often--and it stays fun.

For my tastes, the best of the Tikal-Mexica-Torres-Java action point games, where the smaller number of actions and ability to save an action from one turn to the next can help reduce, but not eliminate, the tremendous amount of AP inherent in this system.

It's the only one I'm willing to play.

Although visually less attractive that the other "Mask" games (Java is especially beautiful), this is the best game of the trilogy. The reason for this, is that the game plays well with three AND four (you definitely need 4 with Java), it has less rules to explain than the other two (especially Java), it has less downtime, and there is less luck involved (drawing volcanoes in Tikal really diminishes your chances). It induces Turn Angst in almost every turn, and the end game can be quite a thriller! Like all "Mask" games, this game needs to be played fast though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The lightest of three games in the Mask Trilogy, I rank Mexica on par with Tikal but below Java. A few design details about Mexica stood out for me: The extra action chits makes gameplay go a lot faster. If you can't figure out what to do with those left over action points, just take an extra action chit. That way, you won't feel cheated by not using all the points and hence, won't feel compelled to rethink your options for the round. Definitely saves you from AP. Still player AP is mildly present with these games, though not nearly as bad as Tikal. 6 action points as opposed to 10 is also good. The game is certainly shorter than Tikal and Java but scratches the same itch. Finally, the board layout after the game is just gorgeous and the pieces are outright fantastic. I really miss the early RGG Euro games. Like Big City, this game just looks amazing. Overall, a big thumbs up for this Kramer and Kiesling design. A joy to play.

I got this from Terri for Christmas 04.  I was interested in Tikal, but some comments recommended this as a better game.  I went ahead and got Tikal, and like it alot.  I also played a friend's copy of Java and like that too, so I felt this would be an easy choice.

I have one two player game and one 4 player game.  I thought the movement would be much more restricted, but the canals give you alot of options.  I thought it would be faster to play than Tikal, but so far it does not seem significantly faster.  Part of this may be because I find Tikal fascinating, so play time has not been that noticeable.  The four player game seemed better than the two player game.  Obviously there is more going on, but the difference in strategy between going first and going last is more pronounced.  Going last in a 4 player game of Mexica seems to be more about taking advantage of oportunity and less about making your own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Majority game. Reasonable with 2, but would be much more interesting with 3 or preferably 4. Same problem as El Grande with 2: either you or the other is the winner in a district. Second and third places provide deeper decisions.

RATING: 6
Mexica sort of reminds me of Kramer's Tycoon, rather than the other mask games. You fly around to different spots and set down buildings to get majorities. Travel can be rather expensive, so the trade-off is whether or not to visit a lot of areas and set down few buildings in each, or to stay for longer periods in a few areas and plop down many buildings. Compared to the other Mask games, Mexica is my least favorite after playing it once. It's just so static. Anything you set down becomes permanent. So in many parts of the game there's not very much going on on the board. Additionally, with only the one Mexica pawn, your options are pretty limited turn to turn. Given that not much is happening in the game, the downtime and AP potential of the action point system just add tedium to an already sort of dull game.

All in all, not a bad game (and also it's a great looking one), I think it's just outshone by Tycoon for the similar area-control and movement, and by Tikal and Java for the action point system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I love the game, I'm finally hit with the realization that I don't need to own similar games. I prefer Kiesling and Kramer's Seeland over this. Is Mexica deeper?  Probably. Don't care. Seeland actually has better thematic mechanics even if it might be lighter. 

Great game, but don't need to own.

Played once, a week after Tikal. I like this, but not as much as its sibling (with auctions): Mexica is quicker and less prone to AP & downtime, but it's the other game I'm keener to play again - because of the auctions, because it's a little less abstract, has the terrain-tile randomness, and just is prettier.

A decent game, but was a bit disappointed despite the fantastic production.  Kind of a neat abstract that doesn't really feel like you're playing an abstract, but it's relatively straight forward and not one that I'm excited to play again.  I enjoyed it enough though.

Mexica plots the development of the city of the same name on an island in lake Texcoco. Players attempt to partition it into districts, place buildings and construct canals.

Districts are formed by completely surrounding areas of the island with water and then placing a District marker. The player who founds a district scores points immediately.

Canals and Lake Texcoco act as a quick method of moving throughout the city. Players erect bridges and moving from one bridge to the next which costs 1 action point regardless of the distance. They must also erect buildings. This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the buildings size.

In the scoring phases of the game, players score points
(El Grande style) based upon their dominance in a District. In the 4 player game players with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.

Only districts are scored in the first scoring round.

In the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.

The player with the most points wins.

Winner of Tric Trac d'Argent 2002.

Mexica is the third game in the Mask Trilogy.

Large box a la Masks trilogy, naturally.

Tikal is everywhere, even Tikal II isn't that rare, but Mexica and Java are almost nowhere to be seen. I still want to hunt down a copy of Java, not sure which of the three I will prefer or if Torres will clip them all - I still very much like Tikal though, it just seems to hit the right beats and the right time. Majorities and timing again, I'll see if Mexica is as good if not better than the others.

Very cool, gorgeous looking abstract game. The whole action point allowance system gives you a lot of options and allows for a very competitive, offensive play. 

The only downside is that you can't really plan anything before your turn arrives as the state of the board will change completely by then. Mexica is very tactical in this regard. Still, I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a multiplayer abstract game with meaningful decisions and no randomness.

Action point system with grid movement for area control of an ancient island civilization on Lake Texcoco. Crazy movement rules as you dig canals, place bridges and erect  Aztecan or Mayan like structures for majority points of the city districts. Placing the chunky 3-D structures on the board is tactilely satisfying and watching the island come to 3D life as a sprawling ancient metropolis is rewarding. Watch out for getting trapped by walls of structures unexpectedly which adds a good dose of interaction. Unique and memorable area control game.

First off, the components...they're such good quality!  However, I do have two complaints: All of the buildings are so awesome, yet the marker for the scoring track is just a small, wooden cube.

They really look fantastic, they have a nice weathered look to them, but some of the colors are difficult to differentiate unless they're side by side.  Gameplay-wise, I really like this one.  It's fun trying to figure out not only how to close off areas in the size you want, but also how to block people out of them.

I really like fairly easy to explain spatial abstract games... and this is a classic in that genre. The relatively straight forward area control is made more interesting with the areas you are trying to control forming during the course of the game. I also like how the limitations imposed by the pawns' movement effect how you plan out your turn.  An easy addition to my abstractish, quickish game rotation.

RATING: 7
While I love the design of multiple paths to victory, Mexica feels like it took that aspect too far, that it ended up being too busy and all of the scoring opportunities were just there for the sake of accruing more points.  The area control gameplay does allow one to employ some interesting strategies, but I did not care for how the game seemed to be reduced to bridge hopping and positioning of your piece in such a way as to disallow others access to districts you want to protect.

Thematically inferior than Tikal.  Of the masks trilogy I like this slightly better than Java.

It's a nice game, a bit lighter than Tikal, but I like to have it, partly because it's part of the trilogy and partly because the game is enjoyable. If Tikal is too hard for you (like you can't win at all) then try this. It's easier, but also have a decent depth to it. The movement rules are a bit difficult to teach, but after understood the game became quite straight forward.
After 1 turn everyone'll be familiar and confident with the rules. I give it a 9, because it's a good game for what it is: A low-middle weight strategy.

IMHO, this game is much better than "Tikal".  I love more constructive atmosphere here.

The only really fun of the this game is fun, negative interaction - trying to block opponents with every move nearly as much as secure victory points.

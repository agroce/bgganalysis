The best Red Dragon Inn set, for me. I played almost all the characters from the previous sets, and got this one because it was more new characters for the group. They got rid of that frustrating/rules arguing Wench gambling card. The sea event deck is a really nice addition that can help to move the game along, but others seldom want to play with it (because it's unfamiliar). The characters in this set are a nice mix of the archetypes, with no really difficult exceptions. Remy does have a tokens system, but it's really straightforward to use.

I liked the characters from the original better, but these were still entertaining. Best played when accompanied with real drinks.

Now you're on a boat. Added "Sea Deck" for extra level of gameplay. 4 more characters! 21 player RDI game? Sure!

All RDI's are fun but this one is the first I ever played and my favorite of them since it gives the extra 'Sea events' deck and I love the sea theme! Have had the idea of playing it as an actual drinking game for awhile.

By far the most interesting of the first 4 versions. It adds a sea event deck and the characters are very lovable (who doesn't love strong lady pirates?). Unfortunately, RDI isn't that enjoyable by itself, and it sort of lost its novelty as soon as I graduated college. 

That being said, it would still be my drinking game of choice, and I have to give it some credit for providing me many fond memories of drinking bizarre brews and causing a ruckus with my mates.

The sea events are a nice addition, but as with the older editions: The red dragon inn is just not a good game.

This is a good expansion, and I'd say it's a must have because of the sea event deck. It really adds some variety to change things up, and can even lead to faster games as well. Definitely worth the buy if you enjoy Red Dragon Inn.

Standalone expansion, four characters, great theme (naval crew this time), integrates with existing games.  Some characters have a unique mechanic this time around.  Additionally there is a global (Sea) encounter deck that offers some new challenges.

Glad to see another expansion for Red Dragon Inn, and this one had potential, but largely doesn't add as much to the game as much as it distracts. I like that events come up and that everyone has to participate. It's cool, even if the method for introducing them is a little on the fiddly side. The new characters have one big thing going for them- they are all COOL. You want to play with these characters even if you don't use the sea-going thematic elements introduced with this expansion. I was hoping there might be a chance here to fix what is wrong with this game, but nope. Nothing doing. Still no strategy, and no way to properly defend against ganking.

I like this game a lot.  It's light and requires more reading than thinking. The one thing I would change is the card text. A little big bigger font/print would have been nice.

* Kickstarted! *

Card-based game with the goal of drinking your opponents under the table (no real alcohol involved). New to this game is the sea setting where external events can have an effect. What stands out the most is the ability to hurt your opponents. What bothers my gaming group is that each character's style of play needs at least one or two games to really grasp and use effectively. Still a worthwhile investment as a lighter game.

BIG PLUS: interaction with opponents
PLUS: expandable with other base sets & expansions
MINUS: limited strategy

I don't really like the Red Dragon Inn games. In general, I'm not a huge fan of when meta can play into a game so much. I feel like I'm always targeted because of being me, and it's only fun when we're drinking a lot at the same time.

Red Dragon Inn 4 is the best of the Red Dragon Inn games. The characters are great on their own, and really make the game interesting, when you mix RDI4 and other RDI characters. The Sea Events are great, and add another layer of depth to the RDI universe.

This is a great iteration of the RDI series. The characters are a little more complex than RDI 1 or 2, but hardly complicated. I don't really care for the ship mechanic much, though.

RDI4 has a much simpler cast of characters than RDI3. None of these characters have secondary decks, and all of them are pretty straightforward. Still, they're all pretty entertaining characters.

The main thing RDI4 adds is a sailing mechanic, where--instead of drinking at the inn--you're drinking on a ship. And things happen on that ship that affect your game. It's an interesting mechanic, although I haven't tried it out enough to know how I feel about it.

Moves the fun to the deck of a ship, where there are random events that happen every so often.  Makes the game better.  As usual, fully compatible with all editions of the game.

The rules seem to be written and proofed by people who didn't pass it by anyone unfamiliar with the game. Several steps were omitted (or not clarified), like that the character tiles are your starting tiles. The first play through was painful in the beginning, and almost game up several times.

REALLY glad we stuck through. Once we got into the swing of things it was fun and frantic. You need to be a certain type of gamer to like this, and takes a good amount of mental resources.

Feels like it should be a game where you make really great machines which combo well but you sort of make a couple of small machines and whoever builds the most needed machine wins by a mile. I think this is better at 2 or 3 rather than the 5 I played it at but the pacing of this felt really off and didn't give enough time for the machines to develop.

Another awesome TMG game. Such a great tile laying, machine building game. The fact that you have to use other peoples machines makes for deliciously painful decisions. You also have to manage how great you build your own machines. Too good and you risk giving opponents too great of rewards, too weak and no one visits you, which gives you sweet sweet points.

An engine builder in which you build engines.  Engine building I find off-putting in a game, whereas building engines sounds fun.  For my taste Steam Works is too much the dry optimisation exercise.  The game does have some light player interaction.  You can make use of opponents' machines, possibly inconveniencing them, but there is a compensatory vp to soften the blow.  You do need to pay attention to what others build. Across a table this is not made easy by tiny icons on cluttered tiles. There's variability in the order that tiles appear and in the player characters.

Production quality is good, while the artwork is so-so.

First Play: The rules are vague and in places extremely ambiguous. Our four player game stalled frequently in the first hour of play as we tried to agree on what the rules meant. It didn't help that the explanation for the Librarium is totally missing. Each player must have a cheat sheet explaining what the tiles mean. The iconography is not intuitive.

Once we grasped the basics the game gained some momentum but then became extremely drawn out as players had to cross reference each tile on the new conveyor and then reassess the options available from other players arrays. And this was with fast players. Under no circumstances play this with players who have any AP leanings. 

The start player moving on one each round meant that after being start player you had to wait 7 turns to take another turn. As the game slowed this took an age and the fact that your preferred actions might be taken before it got to you meant that you couldn't pre-plan with any confidence. The length of down time just makes you lose interest and table talk regarding anything but the game was frequent. The Alarm Chronometer which moves the start player seems very clumsy and to arbitrarily benefit the new second player through luck of the seating position.  

The mechanism to use other players devices was first used in Keyflower and imho more successfully owing to the unique and larger tiles used there. Identifying what other players had was a constant struggle and again time consuming. After 3 hours we opened the third conveyor but had to end the game because it was so late. 

Presentation and component quality is excellent, it's just a shame that more time wasn't spent making the rules clearer with more and better examples. It uses sound and established mechanisms but runs far too long for four players and must be like death of a thousand cuts with five. Would improve once players were well versed with the rules and tiles but a new player in the mix would totally disrupt this. As I rarely play with the same faces week on week, this continuity won't be achieved. Not for me.

I like the uniqueness of this game a lot. It's a ton of fun to try and put together these awesome machines. The only problem for me is that the beginning is kind of slow moving and then it just takes a little too long to play generally for what it is. I may experiment some with shortening the game, but even the way it is I could see getting this out from time to time and enjoying it.

Big mistake for our first play to be a 5-player game.
I would recommend early games should be with 3 or just possibly 4 players. An important facet of the game is using other players' devices and trying to scan the devices created by 4 other players (as well as your own!) is too time- (and brain power-) consuming.

If you take away the theme, this is a game about designing your own unique worker placement spots. BOOM! MIND BLOWN! It takes a while to become familiar with the tiles, but when you do, you can build some fantastic machines that allow you to do a series of actions that build on one another with a single worker. Very AP prone unfortunately, but a thinky and unique game.

Either we were playing it wrong or the game is extremely boring with two players and should only be a 3++ players game. Feels very unpolished and repetitive to an extent that we played the game only twice before selling. After the first play, we thought we did something wrong. I checked the rules, watched videos and made sure we are not making any mistakes that break the game. Second play was as "strange" as the first one and we started realizing why this game was sold off cheap.

RATING: 7.5
I really do like how this game fits together and progresses, but I do worry that without a natural way to progress the game to the end without using opponents machines that the game can really start to drag on a bit long.  I also feel there can be only a critical few turns when someone cranks up an efficient machine before they've escaped possibly being caught by their opponents.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I can feel guilty with such an obvious disparity late in the game.

RATING: 7
Making your contraptions feels good in this game.  Each ability has its use.  I love that you can use other peoples machines, and that is basically the built in catch-up mechanic, but there's a side tactic of building machines others would want to use but also give you something if you do.  I really enjoy this game.

Played only 2p so far, I'm curious how does it work with 3 or 4.

This is a solid game. Basically it's a worker placement with a twist - except for their personal player boards, players themselves create possible spots for workers. Those so called machines can be used not only by their owners but in fact by everyone. They may consist of any number of components - at the beginning it's usually only two, but as the game progresses they become bigger and more effective. Steam Works should appeal to those who are creative and like inventing their own things, as basically players can create any machines they want. Clear combinations emerge after a few plays, there are several possible combos, less or more obvious. I just wish there was more variability in the tiles. Most of them are variants of: take a tile from the conveyor belt, make money, grind money for the points or grind components for the points. There are some unique, more interesting ones but definitely too few! This game just asks for an expansion. At least there are eight semi-assymetrical characters which differ a little bit in terms of their actions and starting resources. Therefore replayability is okay in this one.

The theme is quite nice and original, but I'm not sure if I feel it during the game. A typical euro-case, I believe. Overall I like this game but it's somehow lacking and I don't know why. Maybe it's a matter of too high expectations, because I were quite hyped about Steam Works. I suppose it could be the best with three players, where amount of machines is not overwhelming(it could become a serious problem with 4 or 5p, especially during the late game) and the length of a game depends on how often players use others' devices, where with just two players I feel it's just too fast-paced. 

Edit: Finally after half a year I managed to play Steam Works as a 3 player game! For this variant, my rating definitely gets bumped to 8. Using clocks(instead of money in 2p) adds much depth to the game. Even the element of negotiation becomes apparent - "come on, use my machine, it looks so good, doesn't it?" - whereas in 2 player game it was "ok, I've got one pound... ok". Now it has become much more appealing to build strong machines that could be potentially useful for your opponents - because not only you get points for components themselves, but you also get points when your machine is used by another player. Therefore the level of interaction between players also increases, which is definitely an advantage. I feel like 3 player is an ideal spot for this one, at least in theory - I wish clocks were used in 2 player game, however I understand why the designer chose to use money instead(and he explained that in the topic concerning that issue). It hits right to the point when it comes to depth(again, clocks really work in favor of this game), interaction, the amount of machines and downtime. Unfortunately, I suppose the last two could be a drawback in 4 player game(5 player I wouldn't even try) because at the end of the game we already felt a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of possible options, and it would be obviously even more apparent if there were more people near the table. In addition, I really like when a game allows players to decide when it ends, depending on what actions they take(like in Great Western Trail, for example) and Steam Works does exactly that. Nevertheless, I can see this becomes problematic if players are reluctant to use others' devices and tend to focus only on their own - because they may feel "alright, I am not going to give free points for you!". It's more a matter of what people you play with, but could become a significant issue, making the game overstay its welcome. And I have said that already when I reviewed this half a year ago, but I really, really wish that Steam Works sees an expansion. I love the fact of assymetrical player powers and it saves the game, but variability in tiles is simply too low. And there's definitely a place for something additional, unique - it would probably require adding at least one new element for the game, mechanically wise, but that shouldn't be hard to implement. Despite all of that, I really enjoyed the 3-player game and I'm looking forward to play more such variant. And I wanted to sell this game... boyz, give it a try at least one more time, like I did, there's a high probability that you'll find out this game being much more than it first meets the eye.

An interesting worker placement game where you build the worker placement areas and create more and more complex interactions with those worker placement spaces if it sounds slightly confusing it is.

I really enjoy Lords of Waterdeep as a lightweight worker placement game.  One of the things I like a lot about Lords of Waterdeep is the way new buildings are available in every game, opening up new worker placement spots that support different strategies.

Now imagine building an entire game around that concept:  where the whole game centers on building new worker placement spots and then upgrading them.  In a nutshell, that's what Steam Works does.  And it's really, really fun.  The concept of building different machines in a steampunk universe really works well with the theme, and building up a cool machine that's so useful that your opponents can't resist the urge to use it and give you a benefit is really fun.  The asymmetric abilities of the different characters also adds a ton to the replay value.

I'm bummed that this game didn't seem to sell as well as TMG hoped (given the deep discounts you'll see at OLGSes) - it's a REALLY good game, and well deserving of an expansion or two.

RATING: 6.4
This game deserves a much higher rating than the 6.5 I give it.  My huge objection is all the info that is included on the tiles is so small that by the end of the game I had the worst headache caused by eye strain (& had it still the next morning).  5 played the game with everyone building multiple machines.  If a player wanted to know what benefits were available they had to constantly ask or walk around the table to view numerous spots.  This of course adds considerable time to the game.  At the same time if tiles were larger (much larger) we would have needed a larger table than the large table we had.  Even with reading glasses I still couldn't make out some of the symbols and had to ask what they were.

That said, the game is beautifully designed and well thought out.  Choices are so numerous that avenues to success are plentiful.  With all the available inventors, and tiles, and combinations, there is no way the same, or even a similar game, could be played--so in its favor, it would be a fresh game with new strategy each play. 

Because of the size of the tiles with all that info, probably 3 players is a better size.  However I very much liked the interaction of 5 players, and since each had a different path to winning, my machines were more likely to be in demand.

Wenn Steampunk sein Spiel gefunden hat, dann ist es STEAM WORKS. Endlich ist Dampfmaschine nicht einfach nur thematischer Schmuck, sondern erfährt seine Umsetzung als Eurogame. Die Tiles rollen von Förderbändern. Seltsame Maschinenbauten bevölkern den Tisch: kleine und große, Zahnräder, Rohre, Leitungen, gedanklicher Kabelsalat. Es rattert wunderschön im Kopf. Ein romantisches, dynamisches Industrial-Universum breitet sich aus und bedient jeden Mitspieler. Denn alle können jeden Automat, der wahlweise aus drei verschiedenen Energiequellen angetrieben wird, mit ihren Workern und Robot-Golems besetzen zum Steam Worker Placement. STEAM WORKS vereint die Einsetz-Klarheit von RUSSIAN RAILROADS mit der Idee des Völkertableaus aus TERRA MYSTICA und erfindet Legespiel neu als verrostetes, fragmentarisches CARCASSONNE. Selten hat potenzielle Unübersichtlichkeit auf dem Tisch so Spaß gemacht. Jules Verne wäre STEAM WORKER geworden.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc de col·locació de treballadors i losetes. Es tracta de construir petites "maquines" mitjançant losetes (2-3-4 losetes) que s'agafen d'un taulell principal. Cada màquina d'aquestes ha de tindre com a mínim una font d'energia (existeixen 3 tipus d'energia i les losetes es connecten entre elles a traves de connectors específics, tipus Galaxy Trucker). Per activar les fonts d'energia col·loques treballadors a sobre. La resta de losetes dona beneficis en funció de l'energia suministrada. A més, cada jugador disposa d'un taulell personal amb 4 accions propies del personatge en qüestió.

La gracia del joc és que pots activar les màquines dels altres jugadors donantlis un punt de victoria (i accelerant el joc).

No acabo de veure clar l'interacció del joc, crec que cadascú buscarà el seu combo particular i s'oblidarà de les màquines de la resta.En aquest sentit em recorda una mica al Keyflower, però amb moltes menys opcions i més solitari. A més, aquí cada jugador disposa de un màxim de 4-5 treballadors (a l'última de les tres eras), que tampoc dona per tapar gaire a la resta... En principi no em sembla interesant, però si el puc provar el provaré.

I haven't played this yet, but this seems so interesting. Such a unique game-play mechanic, I literally have nothing else that has anything similar. In this game you are an inventor and you will have to invent and build all sort of apparatus to do all sorts of things, or alternatively rent an apparatus from your fellow players to do things. On basic level, it's a traditional worker-placement game, but really, that whole inventing and building part is super cool and it was something that sold this game for me. The fact that it has a Steam Punk theme isn't bad selling point for me either. Game looks good by the way.

Longer game than expected, but that offers the satisfying feel of constructing some crafts and using them (even if their size is limited). The game is probably not going to get a lot of love from most "non-engineering-oriented" minds, unfortunately. The steam theme just adds to the charm, too. The gameplays a little bittoo much on the long side than would be ideal, but it works great. :-)
Need to play this once more. Just once...

A clever and genuinely 'inventive' (no pun intended) game about building free format machines that have in-game effects and generate VPs. I suspect this game may be solvable: there ought to be 'best' machines that cannot be beaten in generating points. Creating those machines is always a fun experience, but scoring seems to be way off. Machines score at a flat rate when bigger machines are harder to create, some triangular scoring was surely in order here. You also don't want to create machines that are too attractive, it just throws points to the next player when your reward is a scant 1VP. I think there's a hint of genius in this design, but it's intensely frustrating to see what it might have been with more development.

Solid worker placement game, you get to build your own machines and work towards upgrading or expanding them to ultimately have the most appealing machine(s).  Points are earned by getting others to use your machines or making machines that get you points. This game is all about reacting and trying to best use your opponents contraptions. Medium weighted game, relatively easy to learn takes about 20 min to teach. It scratches an odd itch, one that you don't normally think you have.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed exploring the building of different machines. One could really get pretty creative and build with quite a bit of intent to generate VPs although one likely only wants to build one such machine? One needs to determine good timing to switch over the focus to gaining VPs as the end game can occur quite quickly when the final round rolls around. I'd recommend the IAQ as the rules leave a bit to be desired and even are missing the description of one machine. The symbols used become like second nature pretty quickly so those are well done.

This was quite fun, and the theme was well integrated with the mechanics - we had the sense of making and using machines. I disliked the Alarm Chronometer card that changed turn order (maybe because it denied me the first player marker for the last two rounds of the game?) because it felt like a destructive rather than constructive ability - unlike the rest of the game. I would remove that tile if playing again. I did, however, like the haiku generator tile.
This game feels like it would be better with fewer people. I'd like to try it with two players.

The amount of stuff to analyze each turn is dense, due to each component having its own set of things it does. I'd like a little more time to get cool machines built. The goal is to use the machines to get... points. The upkeep between rounds gets tedious.

Steam Works is a game of shared infrastructure, where the players themselves acquire and put together tiles into engines. Each tile will produce an output so the bigger the engine, the better the output. The use of another player's engine rewards the owner, thus giving a double incitement to construct the best engine. I love the idea but the engines themselves feel less engaging (some points here, some points there). Steam Works is still a fun game but both shared infrastructure and engine building is done better in other games.

Totally engaging steampunk "machine-building" theme with worker placement. I love the names and functions of the invention tiles it really is a fun engine-building mechanic.

The rulebook for the first edition is a mess, but the game overall is fun.  Enjoyed building small machines and expanding them over tie to be more and more effective.  If you get a good combo together you can churn out a lot of points.  Letting your opponents use your systems is a good way to mitigate the runaway leader issue.  Biggest hold up is the rulebook though, missing descriptions of some tiles and completely ignoring several rules hampers this from being an even better game.

Quite a clever approach to worker placement but heavy on the downtime department. I like how you need to juggle with the different types of power sources when constructing your thingamabobs, and I also enjoy the dynamics of the Uwe-style usage of other players' contraptions.

*隨機起始，每人拿一個個人圖版使用A面(之後可開人數加一個倒序選，並可選用A或B面)，每人跟據個人圖版拿起始資源跟版塊，拿對應兩個工人放自己圖版對應位置，剩下的放主圖版
*版塊分成下方是齒輪的為能源版塊或是只有分數的為分數版塊，能源版塊可放工人，能量能源分成三種，對應版塊邊緣的管路，只有一樣的可以連接
*遊戲進行多輪，每輪輪流行動，行動二選一，當所有人放完工人則該輪結算
>拿個人圖版最左邊的工人之付下方薪水放到個人圖版或版塊能源區空格啟動結算效果，如過放到別人的版塊上則對手從主圖版最上方的時代區拿走一個時鐘標記(2人拿錢)
*一輪如果拿光一個時代時，要再拿先從供應區拿，全部拿光改拿1分分數標記
*使用組合的版塊時，可啟動相鄰的所有版塊，如果能量能源有多種，不同方向可不同，也可選擇不做，紅色的部分則是別人使用時你也可以做的
*當獲得組裝X大小得效果時，從之前獲得的版塊(個人圖版下)拿X個版塊到上方根據規則組合成可使用版塊區，至少一個能源跟一個配件，且至少一個相對地相連
*轉換器連接能源版塊再接到配件版塊，可改變出來的能源，重複器接到一個配件旁，該配件被啟動時結算兩次
>跳過 把最左邊工人放到自己頭像，並獲得他的位置的薪水
*當所有工人放回，所有人拿回工人，機器人回主圖版，如果該時代的時鐘標記被拿光，下個時代的版塊打開放到對應的傳輸軌，並獲得一個新工人(總共會跨兩個時代)，時代三觸發則遊戲結束，沒結束則把所有傳輸帶最右邊的版塊移到版塊堆底部，然後全部右推開新的補，如果沒得補則移除該時代的所有時鐘標記，解鎖下個時代同之前，之後起始左傳，開始下輪
*遊戲最後所有分數標記加總時鐘標記每個一分，加總自己組的版塊上面有的分數，最高獲勝，平手筆錢跟版塊總和

In Steam Works, players are taking drafting tiles off a central board and using them to construct worker placement actions that they or other players can use.  Like in Le Havre or Caylus, players are trying to own popular actions so they can get valuable kickbacks.  Unlike those games, though, players are assembling multiple tiles to essentially create their own actions, which is really neat and integrates well with the steampunk theme.  The tiles come out in three phases--earlier tiles will help you create better action spaces, where later tiles will help you turn everything into points.  Because you really have to stare at what actions everyone has to offer (and those change drastically from game to game), the game unfortunately really bogs down at higher player counts.  On the whole, though, I think this game has a nice mechanical premise that works well with the theme, and can be very enjoyable at lower player counts.

RATING: 7.5
After some disappointing games like City Hall or OK games (like Scoville), finally TMG has put again a game on the market that's worth owning. But it also comes (in Europe) with a high selling price. 

There is only 1 very big minus about this game: the rulebook. 1 component is even missing (you can find an updated rulebook in the files section), but the rules are unclear on a lot of things. After reading the rules you have the feeling that you can built further on existing devices, but that ain't the case as it would make the Upgrader useless. What ain't clear either from the rules is if you have 2 electrical components connected in series, you activate both when you put your mechanic an the electrical source or just the orthogonal adjacent ones? Our gut feeling says both, but it would have been nice that the rules were clear on that.

Not unpleasant; not broken; not problematic. More than anything just not my kind of game.

Quite abstract. Turns go real quick at the start, then they begin to drag as players get more 'machines' in play and there are more options to consider. 

Components are nice, though.

Tile placement to build up your machines so you can use them later. Any player can use any machine. It is a very interesting game. I still really enjoyed it even after playing with 5p (don't play with 5p). It can be hard for first timers to play since there is a lot going on. There is a lot of keep track of and who did what sort of thing. I am very excited to try the special powers. Very much enjoyed this game. I need to play it more.

Nice concept that your engine builder is building an engine. You draft tiles that are divided into power sources and devices using combinations of 3 sources. As you build combination of actions you or your opponents can use the actions driven from what you have built. So far so good.

The rule book is poor, the tiles are poorly explained and we spent quite a bit of time, deciding on what the designer intended the tile to accomplish. The game could have used a developer and a blind playtest so the deficiencies in the rule book could have been identified before publishing. Yes it that bad.

Using other player machines is the primary way to drive the game. Giving victory points to your opponents is how you move the game along. It doesn't really seem to work to drive the game along. It difficult of determining what other players have put together, it is hard to see across the table. Also how to use what's built really slows the game down, woe to the group if any player has AP tendencies. Playing with 4 is difficult, 5 excruciating. 

Has some good ideas but it misses the mark.

Vying for my favorite game that I brought back from Essen this year. 3 plays so far and still a real brain burner with decent variation between games from the assortment of devices the players build. Haven't tried it with 5 yet and slightly nervous to - my one worry with the game is that it seems very AP prone, particularly on later turns when there can be a dozen or so devices in play. With the right group, though, it shines.

--Feb2016-- Likely a very much better game than I'm giving it credit.  But - with four, at least - it's not a game for me.  There's too much information that one needs to have at one's fingertips that's rather hard to track.  And, yet, I expect that one could become better at it with practice, and that it's better (for me, at least) with fewer players.  So I'll likely need to re-rate if I ever have the chance to play with two or three.  And I'm completely disinclined to consider playing with 5!

This is a pretty good game. I like the fact that you can activate other players' machines. It introduces the same kind of tension that you feel in Keyflower when you're worried about someone activating your village tiles before you can.

-It lasts too many rounds and overstays its welcome
-Even though the game should have a lot of variety, it feels samey each round/time you play

The very definition of a broken game, because Tasty Minstrel couldn't be bothered to include all of the fucking rules in the fucking rule book! What fucking idiots.
I spent nearly two hours trying to figure out this game from the incomplete rules, consulted BGG forums, and finally realized this game is a piece of shit before giving up. Gone from the collection. Too bad, the idea and components look great. I had such high hopes for this one.

So many actions leads to major AP

The concept of this game - Building the worker placement spots as you go for a highly variable system - is absolutely fantastic and works well with the steampunk theme.

Unfortunately, the length lets it down - The game just drags and I don't feel myself wanting to go through that again.

Plus, there's the unfortunate fact that most of the machines end up being variants of the same things over and over again - I think I would have enjoyed it more if the game toned down the quantity of them you build - Less options -> less AP, -> faster play & more fun. (Maybe).

1 play, 4er

Interesting worker placement game. Start with 2 workers, gain 1 with each Era advancement (up to max 4). Use workers to acquire parts (better ones available later in game), build machines, or run machines (which improve your machines, score you VP, earn you coins, etc.). If you use someone else’s machine, they get a clock token (which is worth 1 VP, and also the game timer which advances you through the Eras to game end). The problem, though, is that your options grow so much as the game goes on (more workers, more machines available) that the game slows down a lot as you move ahead. Still, may be better with fewer players and the custom-built machines make this interesting enough to want to try again. Maybe.

tl;dr: very cool worker placement system

Worker placement games - which among my favorite mechanisms by the way - come in many shapes and sizes. Most of them have either fixed locations, or locations which can be built (like cards or tiles) or a combination of the two. This game does something new: you build a location, but it doesn't do anything by itself. You can add modules to it which adds functionality. And you can have multiples on each location and combine them to make them better. How cool is that? Well, pretty damn cool if you ask me.
On top of that this is a very solid game in it's own right, not just a rehashed game with a nice twist.
I got the feeling this game has quite a good replay value and I look forward to playing it again soon.
I must also note that this is one of the best games TMG has put out in recent years. A lot of their output has been solid but most of it didn't stand out. This one brings them back to the level I expect from TMG.
One huge downside of this game is: I want it, but the price is ridiculous, especially in Europe. I'll see if I can find a copy at a reasonable price somewhere.

„ Wiek Pary”, czyli jak zdobyć tytuł mgr inż. w weekend.

Plusy:
1.	Solidne wydanie.
2.	Proste zasady.
3.	Czytelne grafiki/symbole
4.	Interakcja
5.	Mechanika
6.	Regrywalność


Minusy:
1.	Uciekający klimat Steampunka.
2.	Brak wypraski.

„ Wiek Pary”, to bardzo ciekawy worker placement, którego zasady są łatwe, ale wprawy w tworzeniu maszyn nabierzemy po kilku partiach. Pierwsze partie to budowa maszyn po omacku, bo nie wiemy jeszcze jak to wszystko działa i jak podejść do tej inżynierskiej zagwozdki a to zachęca do kolejnych rozgrywek. Czuć w grze klimat tworzenia maszyn, czuć, że tworzymy coś, co po uruchomieniu buchnie parą, koła zębate pójdą w ruch a wszędobylskie żarówki rozżarzą, jak kontrolki w moim starym samochodzie. Klimat odczuwalny, ale nie klimat steampunka, określiłbym go, jako industrialny. Interakcja wymusza podjęcie decyzji czy budujemy maszynę dla siebie czy też chcemy skusić innych do jej aktywacji. Ma to wpływ nie tylko na ilość punktów i profity, ale i na czas rozgrywki. Moim zdaniem gra w 4 osoby to maksymalny wariant, ponieważ przy 4 osobach robi się mały chaos na stole i trudno ogarnąć wszystkie maszyny. Gra ma swój specyficzny urok, który potęgują grafiki, które są czytelne i idealnie wpasowują się w klimat, choć urodą nie powalają. Grę polecam 7/10

This has to be one of the worst games we've purchased.  I don't know why, exactly, but it didn't live up to the game we were hoping it would be.  It ended up very confusing to play (and we have several heavier games) and even consulting the rules didn't ease confusion.  It was frustrating and wasn't fun, at all, so we quit halfway through.

Engaging worker action and tile placement as steampunk tinkerers assemble contraptions for the glory of Queen Victoria. Grab component tiles off the conveyer belts and hook them up to a power sources of clockwork, steam, or Tesla-electricity. The engaging aspect of the game begins as contraptions are built they become additional action spaces for all players to advance your devices or generate more prestige with the Queen. Cool interaction and scale from simple to complex components that is satisfying. Good gateway to worker placement. I enjoy games that allow use of opponent buildings with the tradeoff that they get a coin. I like the countdown timer into the advanced inventions based on using other player contraptions. I also like the added decision pressure from the conveyor belt theme forcing unused invention pieces to be pushed out of the game.

So much fun! It seemed like there were so many possibilities. Machines got cooler and cooler, we got smarter about what we were building, and next thing you know it was the final round... however, do NOT play this with someone prone to analysis paralysis. They are gonna end up examining sooooo many machines to decide how to place their workers, and the game will go on way longer than it should.

Had a blast playing this at Gen Con. More of a deck of puzzles and a story than an escape, but it was great.

Use the hints!  Use them before trying a puzzle if you are not sure you have the right solution.  It makes for a much more satisfying game to get a hint and then figure out the puzzles for yourself than taking a guess, getting it wrong, and moving on.  That said, I strongly prefer the Unlock! series (or even the Exit series) of escape room games to the Deckscape series.

Much like Test Time, it was pretty decent. For the price, its definitely worth playing. A little over an hour of entertainment that can be shared with friends and replayed years down the road if you forget the solutions because the game is not destroyed like some escape room games. Some great puzzles, and some that are really stupid and make no sense. The ending to this one was a little better than Test Time.

One-off room escape game based on one deck of cards. Big cards. Some of the puzzles are great but majority is absurd or out of place. Still fun way to spend 2 hours and $10 with friends.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Limited space for puzzle building where only cards are used and there is no destruction of components.

After doing this second Deckscape, I think I might be done with the system. I don't care for the puzzles being one try and done, and the puzzles are by turns either ridiculously easy or just plain obtuse. It's not a bad way to pass an hour or so, but it's also bottom of the pack for tabletop escape rooms. I do like the kind of "choose your own adventure" endings, though.

I love escape rooms and even boxed versions like Unlocked or Exit.

This one... I hated. No spoilers, so feel free to read ahead.

Unlike the other two mentioned, in this one, the puzzles are listed on one side of the card and you flip them over. What this means is you only have 1(!) shot of answering the puzzle. Normal escape rooms (boxed or otherwise) will just tell you "yes" or "no" and will let you rethink your steps.

Another problem is that a basic rules of Escape Rooms - a rule that's written in this game as well mind you - is that they are supposed to be about logic. Not knowledge.
You should never have a question such as "who was president of the USA in 1921?"

But there was such a thing in the game.

Some of the clues are really so small on the cards that you can hardly see them. Unlike Unlock, where it's the point and you're being told to look for them, here it just looks like bad printing.

And last but not least... The puzzles themselves... Some of them are absurdly easy and some of the are so mind boggling I can't possibly imagine how is one supposed to come up with that.

It works and really tries to have several separate tracks at the same time allowing multiple users to interact.

Personally I would though rate it at the bottom of the escape rooms. For me some of the Unlocks are best.

RATING: 5
This is a deck of puzzles with very varying quality and methods for solving them. The game doesn't have a system for determining if your solution to a puzzle is correct (except for actually looking at the solution), which is a real problem when the puzzles are all over the place in terms of structure and methods for solving them.
The inconsistency and lack of framework annoyed us so much that we quit playing about 80% through. Some of the puzzles are good. Some of the puzzles translates really badly into card format. Some solutions felt really far fetched and/or illogical.

There were some poorly worded cards where the words were important and some pictures that included clues that were too small to be distinguishable. A fun activity overall, but could have been designed better (graphic and editing).

Really poor experience with this - one particular puzzle needed specific knowledge - A BIG no no. Another puzzle basically had a completely ridiculous solution and a few more were just very tenuous. I enjoyed the first puzzle much more.

RATING: 4
Solved in exactly an hour with 5-2 crosses. Some decently challenging puzzles, a lot of instantly obvious ones, four with insufficiently clear illustrations, and a couple of inexcusable trick answers. A lot weaker than "Exit The Game" for having all of the puzzles answered by flipping the card to reveal, making it feel more like any old answers-in-the-back puzzle book. Impressed for it giving a decent sense of place to begin with, but it quickly descends into any-old-genre absurdity.

Nicely produced with large cards, this escape room in a box is sadly miles behind other similar games with a combination of lazy, weak, and poorly designed puzzles. Avoid and get Unlock or EXIT escape rooms instead.

We had a better time with this game than the earlier one. Same feel as the first, but better puzzles. We found some were clever, while some are annoying and boring.

Some of the puzzles were very vaque and the logic behind them were a bit suspicious. Maybe the weakest of these escape room games that I have played.

No real desire to play these anymore, although i'm not opposed to them if someone invites me to play.

This was a much improved version of this system.  Even though we did not win because of user error on the last puzzle, we really enjoyed this one and thought it was well done.

RATING: 3
Unsatisfying puzzles, some minor but confusing translation issues, and "adventure game logic" where you have to guess how the designer thought rather than logic out the answer. Which is even worse than usual because if you guess it wrong you can't try again, as the game just gives you the answer at that point. Plus one or two puzzles rely on you knowing trivia from outside the game.

RATING: 7.5
A good escape room in the decksploration format. However, it was a little bit too easy and falls behind the EXIT: titles. One could say it was a shame i played them first because this would have been a good introduction to more demanding games and puzzles. In any case it should be an autobuy for anyone interested in the genre as there are not too many alternatives available.

More difficult than Test Time. Contained a couple annoying puzzles, but overall worked still.

Played with four players. Final time was 68 minutes.

At first I was skeptical, but the game delivers a solid escape room experience! Set up is trivial and puts you right into the action. It's a fun afternoon for the whole family.

Ticket to Ride meets TransAmerica.  It works!  And my wife picked up a copy for me for Xmas (much to her slight dismay given my picking up a copy for a good friend, but hey, we might end up at two different gaming events!)

Clever design with some non-obvious strategies.  Lots of squinting at board and cards, though, but it's kinda unavoidable.  Fills a nice niche between [b]Transamerica[/b] and [b]Ticket to Ride[/b], but not sure I'll pick it up.  I'll gladly try it again.

Trans-A-Ticket to America is pretty fun. A lot more interesting than Transamerica or Ticket to Ride (low bar). The decisions are smooth and tense, despite what the game's appearance might lead you to beleive.

Honestly, the worst aspect is the hideous graphic design. It's somewhat horrific... Lines. Lines, everywhere.

The design deserves an 8/10. The product, maybe not so much.

Not sure why you'd want to play TTR after playing this. In our play those who shifted to company cards instead of trying to finish all the regional cards destroyed those who didn't, not sure if this is an actual problem or not. But the flow of this game is solid, and doesn't rely as much on the luck of the draw as TTR does.

It is easy to list the borrowings from other games (track laying from TransAmerica, tickets from Ticket to Ride (TtR), selling routes to major companies from Last Train to Wensleydale) and to dismiss 20th Century Ltd as derivative and not worthy of your gaming time.  In fact, it plays quite differently to any of its influences.  

At the heart of this are two ways to earn victory points.  There are regional networks, which score escalating points for the number you create during the game, up to a whopping 100.  Then there are companies that vary  in length and scoring potential.  A major difference between the two is that track laid to complete a company's route is taken off the board, whereas regional routes remain after they are scored.  Leaving track on the board has benefits; you can re-use it in completing company routes and other players may be obliged to pay you vps if their routes use it.  On the other hand, running out of track is a problem as it isn't in those other games.  A turn taken to pick track up really does feel like a turn closer to defeat.  Luck of the draw is less of a factor than in TtR; there is always a selection of four face up companies to choose from, while bad draws of regional networks can be mitigated by discarding and re-drawing.  The hitch here is that the one you discard is one less towards a maximum of eight.  

20th Century Limited plays smoothly with little downtime.  However, strategic options feel limited.  It makes obvious sense to build and score a regional network and then to make as much use as possible of the same track to complete companies.  The extent to which the available companies allow you to do that will largely determine your success.  Beyond that, decisions revolve around when and what to discard, and that isn't quite enough to keep me interested in this game.  

Artwork and production quality are a big step down from the grand old days of Rio Grande.  I quite like the Art Deco styling of everything, but having said that, the board is pretty ugly, with place names difficult to read.  The cards are quite thin and the green tracks come in two different shades.  Both the cards and the rules could have used more proof-reading.  The rules are poorly structured.

This was described to me as TTR meets Transamerica.
An apt description, except both of those games were original.
The game is very fiddly, plays longer than it needs to, and the city names on the map are so small that I had to stand up a lot to read them, which is, physically, difficult for me.

One play with four. Very engaging game, with simple ruleset but room for strategy. A great next-step from Ticket to Ride or Transamerica... though it might be two or even three steps away. It's not a hard game to explain, but it's a long game that requires constant planning.

Though it's a long game, longer than the box would have you believe, there's a progression from era to era so the game experience grows and you don't feel it's very repetitive. Balancing the work between regional and company is important and is a constant drain on brainpower, because at all times you'll have six cards, each referencing 3-7 cities you have to connect, and it's a bit much to keep it all alive in your head. Simple in concept, but I felt spent by the end.

There are minor aspects which will affect your enjoyment if you're looking for the perfect game. Removing tracks is a chore, one that can disrupt the board if one's not careful. The tracks are too large for the board, they obscure the city names on the board, and the names of the cities on the cards are printed in very small font. These do distract from the experience, so if you're the picky sort, you might not be left 100% satisfied. But those points are minor.

TA mixed with TtR but with some other items added.  It was quite good as it was very tense as people pushed to end game.  The track was a touch long but not all that big a deal.  I really liked that the companies were actual train companies (logo included).  Nice touch.

1 play, 2er.  Seems good to me.  This game probably shines with fewer players because there are lots of decisions and routes get removed from the board which potentially wrecks an opponents' planning for their turn.  For now it's an 8.0 for me, but we'll see if this holds up after repeated plays.

T. Vasel indicates that big routes (although worth tons of points) don't seem to be as good as doing a lot of short routes for fast/easy points because the point value just doesn't compensate adequately for the time/effort; game doesn't reward strategic play as much as it should b/c of the randomness of the cards and big route value issue.

Considering some of the bad press this game got when it came out, I had low expectations. To my suprise, this game is great! It's basically a heavier, more involved hybrid between Ticket to Ride and Transamerica. 

I love how, at the beginning of the game, the regional cards limit players to the same area of the board, forcing them to compete over routes and use each others' track. This loosens up a little as the game goes on, but this "guided" competition forces the game to be a little more in-your-face. 

However, what I also love is that it's not a huge deal to (sometimes) use your opponents' track, and can actually be very beneficial, since you want to keep your track out on the board to score your company cards. 

Excellent little route-building game, and definitely a keeper.

Very pleasantly surprised by this one, it looks really boring and when the rules were explained it sounded too simple to have any meat to it at first, but I was wrong. Definitely feels like a more proactive and less random ticket to ride, something you can play with the family but that won't come down as much to lucky goal card draws since it's so much easier to get track on the board, so many ways to get from one place to another, opportunities to cycle through and look at many different goal cards, and if all else fails it's very easy to use a few of an opponent's rails every once in a while.

Entertaining game of laying track pieces to build rail lines to complete routes on individual regional and company cards for points.  Laying the little track pieces reminded me of the similar activity in "On the Underground".  Trying to manage, read, and separately identify a hand of regional and company cards was a bit awkward but eventually it worked adequately though at times a cardholder would have been very useful.  I'd being willing to play this again but wouldn't be disappointed if I didn't.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Haven't played yet but was disappointed to buy a brand new game off the press and find out the green components were in two very distinct colors. Game still obviously will function fine, but this is not the quality level I have always associated with Rio Grande in the past. Production values feel lesser compared to other RG productions with the cards extremely thin/fragile feel and the box itself feeling a bit unfinished in its "finish."  Disappointing, but looking forward to giving the game a play. 

Played the game and found the game quite enjoyable (although I also played my first game with three of my favorite gamers too so that helps as well). We had a good time with the game and complaining when we would use someone else's track more than others. The waiver system is a nice touch allowing you to use someone else's track. The Transamerica system is in play, but an added component is involved in companies which will cause you to pick up your own track used in the network of the company. Game takes about 30 minutes per player, perhaps less with experience. The town names are tiny on the board and can be hard to find. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The track placement may feel like Transamerica and choosing company cards may feel like choosing tickets in Ticket to Ride but this game is quite a bit deeper than either of those.  I like how the regional cards and the company cards interact and lead the player to develop rails in patterns that generally sketch out the history of railroad expansion throughout America.

20th Century Limited is a connection game in which players place tracks of their color to complete regional and company cards in their hand.  Regional cards involve connecting three cities in one region, and must be completed in order--northeast first, then midwest, then south, etc.  Scoring for regional cards depends only on the number completed.  Company cards involve cities in different regions, and the point value of the card is determined by its difficulty, from under 10 to over 60 points.  The trick with the company cards is that your track used to complete them is removed from the board, which is good (you have more track in supply for new routes) and bad (you can't reuse the placed track for other routes).  I really enjoyed the balancing of the two types of tickets, and how you really wanted to make your regional and company cards work together, since both regional and company cards can't work with themselves.  The game really involved some nice planning elements trying to use your track as efficiently as possible.  It definitely worked for me.

Surprisingly good. It seemed a bit dull in the beginning as everybody was going for the short and easy regional cards, but when you start to be short in track, things become more interesting as you have to start focussing on completing company cards.

Also a plus is the playing time: 60 minutes for a train game is good.

RATING: 8
Though 20th Century Limited uses some mechanics from Ticket to Ride and TransAmerica, the similarity ends there. This is a much deeper game. Though the rules are simple, the complexities of the planning and execution are anything but simple. It is not another Steam but closer in play to Steam that Ticket to Ride.

Note: The 60 minute playtime is....a bit hopeful. Our games clock in closer to 90 - 120 minutes.

Interesting game that uses some ideas from Transamerica for using routes to build cards. I liked the 2 alternate strategies to victory points. Regional routes that leave your links on the board and company routes which remove your completed links. The regional routes which must be scored in order, keep the links and progressively scores more points as multiples are completed. 
There can be some synergy of using regional routes to complete company routes but only if your cards can support it. Since you only have 35 links you need to complete company routes to recycle your links. There is no synergy between companies since track is removed. Key decisions seem to be which companies to discard and when to skip a region. so you can get the company region synergy. It looks to be important to cycle though the companies by discarding while you are working toward one card and trying to get a next that work with what you will have left remaining on the board. 

With all the small print on cards and maps it was hard on these old eyes to verify routes. Especially as you are trying to juggle the regional links and the company links to get some reuse.

Aug 2015: Played at GENCON. Call it 'Super TTR". It had the routes and tracking laying but the Destination Tickets had to be built in escalating levels. The end-game triggered when someone built eight company lines or regions. Enjoyable. I like better than TTR but I like heavier.

This is Ticket to Ride meets TransAmerica meets some other railroad game. You've got the easy track building of TA combined with the route building / connection game of Ticket to Ride. The removing-track-tile thing reminds me of Last Train to Wensleydale -- great little game with a similar theme: players are little guys, building little railroad companies and then selling them off to the large corporations. In Wensleydale, though, the track stays put -- it just changes color. It is a little weird, here, that tracks just pop right off the board!

Good game, though probably better with more than just 2. The production is also good, except:
- the track sticks are a wee bit too big for the board (once you have a lot of sticks near each other, anyway).
- the diagonal banners for city names are weirdly distracting. They're also too small to read easily. I would prefer something more like TA, maybe (I don't remember having trouble seeing city names there)? Or maybe just a slightly bigger board?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup:
- Reveal 3 random bonus cards (each will be awarded to first player to meet condition on card).
- Shuffle the company cards, give 4/player, 4 on display face up; rest in deck. All show cities to connect by track, and VP value.
- Shuffle each deck of region cards 1-8 separately. Give each player 2 1s and 2 2s; each keeps one of each, discarding the other. These also show cities to connect by track.
- Each player gets _ cubes

Your Turn:
1. MUST: Either place 1-3 track sticks (your own color) ANYWHERE on the board, or pick up 1-3 of your track sticks.
2. MAY: Score either a regional or a company card, if you've connected all cities shown on card. May use other players' tracks (pay them 1 cube per stick used), but must use at least one of your own.
- Regional: draw 2 cards from the next highest region you've not had yet, keep one. Must be completed in order 1->8
- Company: remove all YOUR tracks used for that card from the board. Draw a replacement (from 4 face up, or deck)

Game End:
- End of round when any player has built 8 Regional or 8 Company cards. 
- Score VP for:
... completed company cards
... 1/cube
... bonus cards earned
... number of regional cards completed (chart on board)
- Most VP wins! Tiebreaker = more company/regional cards

The board looks pretty bland for my taste but underneath it is some great mechanics. This is what I wanted Ticket to Ride to be. However, the downside is that there's so much downtime in trying to figure out where all the places are on the board. Definitely needs some graphic design overhaul to make the gameplay smoother.

tl;dr: fine family friendly train game.

This game has been described as [thing=9209][/thing] meets [thing=2842][/thing]. And that  is essentially it. But I felt like it is slightly heavier than both of those. The main reason for that is that there are 2 kinds of tickets. For one of those kinds you need to remove all of your own track pieces so you can't reuse them for other tickets unless you rebuild them. This rather small detail does have quite an impact on how to play. But all in all I would say this is a very solid mashup of the two aforementioned titles that is different enough to warrant a couple of plays at least.

Initial rating: 6.7/10

After more play, I find I don't particularly like 20th CL. The numbered routes force you to go to regions in order, so it feels like you have little choice. The graphic design is low contrast and hard to read, paired cities like Dallas/Fort Worth are just referred to by one or the other name inconsistently, and cities often match poorly with the map. It outstays its welcome.

Played a couple times. Interesting despite its apparent similarity to [thing=2842][/thing]/[thing=16267][/thing] or Rail Baron etc. An interesting to play and challenging game, far above Trans--- (except in elegance) and not with the tiresome and clichéd stock mechanics as in RB. Vaguely like TTR, but you can dump some routes you don't want; some, you get a choice of two and you're stuck with one of the two.

However, production quality is very poor. The copy I saw had a torn box lid, a warped board (in SoCal where humidity is pretty stable), rail bits (like Trans---) a little long for the legs of the triangular tiling (the connection lines of a hex tiled), and inconsistent colors. RGG has been working with a new printer, so I hope the issue is temporary; 20thC isn't close to RGG's usual standard of quality.

Its not a 60 minute game by far. Its more like 2-3 hours.  Its fun though. Crosses Transamerica and Ticket to ride. you all start on the East coast of USA with your regional and larger companies (essentially destination contracts) and expand outwards towards the west where the destination goals become very long and much harder to do.  This is where using other people's tracks can be used via what are called Waiver chips to fulful a regional or company card.  Advancing on regional will increase your points at the end of the game and the distance between them can be anything between 10-20 points for 1 regional card completed.  Dismissing regional cards and doing company contract cards is optional way of playing but you will not score as much as regional and you will end up running of track.  This is where the place/remove track comes into play.

I honestly didn't think I'd like this game. The artwork is poor, the components are poor. The look and feel feels cheap and the whole pasted on merger between Transamerica/Ticket to Ride made me think this was done on the cheap -- but having played it once, I would play it again -- its a very good but strange game.  Defintely not 60 minutes though

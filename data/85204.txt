RATING: 9
It's Warhammer that actually works. It's modern, streamlined, paired-down and plays within an acceptable timeframe (60-90 minutes per game rather than hours for WHFB).

We'll certainly add more magic in our group, which is the only area of the game that I consider to be too simple. Everything else kicks serious arse. Why am I so glad? Because I've been wanting to go back to smashing fantasy armies into one another for years now, But I'm long past the day I will give Games Workshop anymore of my hard earned cash.

The best massive battle wargame there is. Fast, simple but not simplistic and always delivers those badass moments that make wargames amazing
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
An OK miniatures game which is a bit bland.  Mantic took no chances with this ruleset and the play often suffers from being entirely based on direct maneuvering hinged on your desire to be the one that charges first.

Good solid, simple ruleset that lets you get into gaming quickly. It's easy to game this using elements rather than individual figures as there is no casualty removal. My non-gamer buddies enjoy playing this as it is so easy to pick up and play. Highly recommended

RATING: 8
Fairly new to this, but looks promising so far.
Wasn't sure whether I would take to a stripped down ruleset after playing heavier miniatures games, but this has been fun so far.
The simplified, and subtle magic system I am finding more satisfying than warhammer's magic phase which often results in nothing happening as the system pushes you towards countering your opponents spells as much as possible.

RATING: N/A
●Too expensive (although from Mantic Games) even to create a 2000 points army (about $700MYR)
●Too much to paint.

It is good for fast play and for playing a game where the movement trumps having a super powerful unit. The 2nd edition rules are great, easy to learn, challenging to master your forces. Its great to not have to pick up the rule book before every action.

RATING: 9
Exceedingly simple tabletop mass-battles game.  Mantic's minis may not always be top-drawer, but they are affordable & they do cover about a dozen different armies (as of today) with more options to come.  And, of course, feel free to use your minis from other companies (rhymes with Flames Jerkchop.)  Smaller battles (1200 pts & below) can be played on a 4x4 table & completed in an hour.  A tough game not to like, unless you are some hyper-competitive tourney player than insists on having sub-rules upon sub-rules to take advantage of some broken magic combo (if this is the case, remind me to never play you at Kings Of War.)

An excellent fantasy wargame - has more than enough for significant strategy but not overburdened with rules. I've played in with my old warhammer minis and it works a treat.

My new favorite table top miniatures game.  The best blend of tactics, (relatively) low price entry point, and rules that I've played.  And buckets of dice!  What more does one need?

This is a simple but elegant miniature wargame. As someone that has played a ton of mini games, its refreshing to find a game like this. Easy to play + its much cheaper to build an army than Warhammer. A great intro level wargame game that kids and adults can both enjoy.

Mechanically simple, but tactically deep and rewarding miniatures game. A real 'easy to learn, hard to master' game, with no one correct way of building or playing any army, so huge replayability and variation.

Enjoying not giving any more money to Games Workshop quite a bit.

UPDATE 2016.01.18: Okay, way more games under my belt now. This game is great. Totally scratches the itch with way less rules arguments, way less finicky miniature removing junk, a streamlined rule set, decent miniature for the cost support, and both strategic and tactical depth that that other fantasy war game never really achieved (IMO).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If you're looking for a Fantasy Tabletop battle game, where blocks of troops cross the battlefield with dragons flying overhead and siege weapons firing from behind, this is the game for you.  You can use any figures you want/already have, and could even play the game with flat cutouts just to demo.  However the game really shines when you bring a fully painted army to the table.

Speed Warhammer. The game plays quick and thus the potential suffering does not take for very long. Even quite fun once in a while. The ammount of dice rolled is insane though and really gets on my nerves after the novelty wears of.

OWNED, but I do not list books here anymore as it distorts the figures for board games owned.

Rules and system draw obvious parallels to Warhammer Fantasy Battle. KOW, to me, is a stripped-down version of WFHB, with magic pared down to essentially a special ranged attack and a healing type spell *and now a small list of magic items available to all armies. IGO-UGO turn system.
System encourages building massive armies a la WFHB, though players could obviously "cheat" by utilizing unit bases that match frontages in the rules but placing fewer figures on the bases. As I do.

KOW has gotten me to dust off my WFHB stuff and have a go; hopefully future army lists get released soon - i.e. humans, goblins, evil not-Chaos humans.
Like how Mantic is giving the rules and army lists away free.
After three plays, two of Undead vs Dwarves and one Orcs vs Dwarves, I like the system for ease of play. All three games were around 1200 points on a 4X6 table, and 4X8 would be better IMO. Use Risk army pieces for damage counters, and this works well.
As Mantic invests new models and time into the game, I am liking it more. Being able to play a 2000-pt game in 90 minutes is great.
After 7 plays, using elfs and humans as well, definitely am done with my thoughts of going back to Warhammer.

A solid, smooth, simple system for mass fantasy battles. It loses some flavor and some narrative in that smooth simplicity, but the creative freedom that the system allows makes up for it somewhat.

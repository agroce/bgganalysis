Fun deck! Well done!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This was quite enjoyable.  More thematic than most of the escape room games I've done.  Puzzles were definitely on the easier side and lacked a 'wow' moment, but still, good fun and probably my favourite Unlock! so far.

RATING: 5
A little bit dissapointing after Season 1.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The puzzles were OK but like the rest of the Unlock! series, this one relies too heavily upon their idiotic hidden number system. The puzzles are a weird mix of too easy and "screw it, I give up!" without ever really finding that happy medium, making the whole experience rather unenjoyable.

RATING: 7
Didn't have the machines and seemed more like a collection of random puzzles.  Probably my least favorite of the second set, and only just above the squeak/sausage puzzle.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

++ Some interesting puzzles (4 or 5), but the game was easier that what we like on the whole but it was still a fun challenge.
++ Really good theme in this one, with also a good progression and flow of the game.


:thumbsup: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

-- There is still some really hidden numbers in this one (but not too much) and they were hard to see because the art is really dark and even just our fingerprints on the cards (with the glare on the cards) was hiding one number that we easily missed just because of that.

The music on the app added to a lot of the fun. I failed as this was my first Unlock! game, so I wasn't really sure exactly what I was supposed to do and ended up with a few extra penalties. I think I would have gotten it right under the wire had I not done that. But it was fun and I would definitely try another one! I like that you don't have to throw this out, you can replay it with friends and guide them or you can give it away to a friend when you're done.

RATING: 5
Components: Nice artwork, as is usual with the series. But the gloomy interior makes it especially difficult to see any hidden numbers. There was a bug in my app that prevented me from advancing beyond a specific code card.

Experience: Not particularly interesting. Not very many puzzles to solve, and the few that were a challenge were very convoluted and unintuitive. In one place blue and red cards are used for something other than combining with each other, which I thought was a cheat. As with other entries in this series, it's confusing to know when seeing a number on a card entitles me to take the corresponding numbered card, and when those numbers are provided for the benefit of solving a code. There were two cards in particular, each covered in numbers, one of which corresponded to the ability to take the corresponding card, whereas the other did not. This is my fifth Unlock game, and I've enjoyed each one less than the one before it.

Another fine addition to the Unlock series. This one is the first and easiest of the Mystery Adventures collection. The system has been refined and works very well here - it does a good job of also simulating the use of objects. My family (wife, two girls 12 and 14 y.o.) enjoyed the puzzles, especially the last one.

I liked this better than some entries in the Unlock series, but this one was unsatisfying. The puzzles were fair (which is not something I'd say for all of them), but it was very easy, and even after three wrong codes (costing us nine precious minutes), we finished with over fifteen minutes to spare.

This was the first Unlock! game I played.  I borrowed it from Nick C at Alternate Universes and played it on my Vegas trip.  I finished in just about an hour and loved it!

Really clever use of the cards to make different types of puzzles.  I think this is one of the easiest in the series.  It definitely made me want to play others.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2017)
 
I´m currently loving the Unlock! series of games. When they arrive I want to play them right away and that never happens, I have a game system that tells me which game to play next, but the Unlock! games can override it :D.

Unlock! The House on the Hill has been my least liked Unlock game and I LOVE the theme. The reason, it is way too easy. These games are supposed to offer a challenge, but in this one, we weren’t stuck in a single puzzle and we were two players. The fun for me, is to solve the puzzles without using any help, so I never ask for hints nor I let me partners to do so (but in this game there wasn’t any need to enforce this :/).

Best with two players due to the low difficulty.

The art is amazingly good, I love it.

In general, I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. At least, in Space Cowboys´ games you don’t physically destroy the game, thus preserving the resale value. That’s the only reason I bought the whole series of games while I can’t buy The Exit series of games. It isn’t about the money though, I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience. Kudos to Space Cowboys for not doing this.

[o]
Unlock! The House on the Hill´s puzzles are very easy and that’s a shame. This iteration of the game offers some of the hardest to see hidden objects, but my SO always check every card for those so they don’t offer a hard challenge for us (her). For my part, I can say I really like hidden objects and I don’t understand why so many people complain about them. They offer a challenge and you use a skill (observation) to solve them. The hardest part for us was deciding when to use a hammer to break a glass (I didn’t want to use brute force). I though that was too obvious and I didn’t want to get a penalty, but my SO was right and after she talked me into it we saw that was the right move :D.[/o]

Bottom line, Unlock! The House on the Hill is my least favorite in the whole series, but it is still good game. I wish it was a lot harder, the puzzles here are pretty easy to solve. I love the theme and I hope the next series of Unlock! games arrive soon (hopefully they will be a lot harder). This is the best scenario to introduce new gamers to the series.

My wife and I just love the unlock games!! And we really enjoyed this one! The puzzles felt fresh still and we both found answers to puzzles the other one was stuck on. The go to when stuck is looking for hidden numbers but once you know that the game flows.

RATING: 9
Definitely easier that the other two I've played, but still very good and highly enjoyable. I like that I was able to "replay" the game with one of the people who played but was overwhelmed by the chaos. Once she saw how all of the connections were made, something clicked, and she was able to engage when we played the next one.

RATING: 8
First escape game I've tried. 
I like that you don't "destroy" any components while playing (unlike the "Exit" game series). So you can lend this out to others (or sell it) once you have played it.
Either way, I played with a friend and we beat it with 6 minutes left.
i thought the puzzles were pretty clever and I enjoyed playing through it.
Quick tip: if you have less than perfect eyes - like I do - I would recommend getting an actually magnifying glass (or equivalent phone camera, etc.) 
Some things are very hard to spot, even when looking right at them.

"Escape room in a deck of cards with an app. This one is supposedly easier than The Formula, but we did worse with this one. For us, the puzzles are hard enough that we need lots of hints, although only one seemed outright unfair. (It forced you to take a card even though the rules didn't allow you to take a card in that case.)"

What I like:
- Small box and just cards (and an app)
- Non-destructive play so you can sell or trade it along

What I don't like
- Apparently my wife and I are not big escape room buffs
- One puzzle seemed unfair
- The puzzles seemed harder than The Formula, despite this one being rated easier

Rating is assuming it were replayable.

A blast. We have played the first seasons of both Unlock and Exit, and now this Season 2 title. This one and Exit's Abandoned Cabin come on top at the moment. It's one of the easiest. We were able to finish it in around 50 minutes and got 5-star. We took 2 hours to complete Exit's Pharaoh's Tomb using 3 hints, as a reference.
This one was exciting. The theme (Haunted House à la Resident Evil and a reference to Lovecraft (Necronomicon) through Evil Dead) actually came through a bit. No puzzle was frustrating or unfair.
A great addition to the series.

Our present ranking:
1. Unlock! House on the Hill / Exit: Abandoned Cabin
2. Unlock! Squeek & Sausage
3. Exit: Pharaoh's Tomb
4. Unlock! The Island
5. Unlock: The Formula
6. Exit: The Lab

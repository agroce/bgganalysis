So this is actually a fine game and I really enjoy playing it, but there are other games (avalon, deception in HK, mystery of the abbey) that scratch the same itch and give me more satisfaction.

To be honest this is not my type of game. As with Werewolf, I am a terrible liar/bluffer so I'm pretty bad at this. That being said, I've always had fun playing this game, the components are really well made, the downtime is basically zero and player interaction is through the roof.

Replayability is really good even if you play with the same people all the time. When you play with different people each time it varies since some people might be attracted to smuggling, others maybe they're terrible liars - you'll have fun figuring out how people play. 
When you play with the same people time after time, things can get very interesting since you may say things like "The last few games Molly never lied, I'll just let her through" then lo and behold her entire bag was filled with contraband!!

And then the Quality is fantastic. Absolutely nothing to complain about! I would even recommend using the app as it adds great background noises during the timer, and a very attractive final score reveal!

All in all, this is a great bluffing game with lots of little tricks to think about. Trying to trick the sheriff, or find the tricksters when you are the sheriff, it's all great fun! It's almost like you should "Play the Sheriff, not the game." - but the game itself is actually pretty clever too. Trying to get the most apples or bread than your opponents is challenging. I really enjoy how all the points add up in the end - reminds me a bit like 7 Wonders scoring!

I would definitely recommend!

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#FF9933][b]aaj's FAVORITE BLUFFING GAME[/b][/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]
[i]tl;dr - This is my favorite social game that actually hides a really good game behind itself. I love the bluffing aspect, and this always is welcome at our table. 10/10, highly recommended.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

One of our very favorites. In Sheriff of Nottingham, each player plays as a merchant, who is trying to bring goods to market under the nose of the powerful Sheriff of Nottingham. Players take turns in the role of the sheriff, and must try to guess what other players are bringing in: legal goods, or valuable contraband pepper, silk, and mead? The player with the most valuable market at the end of the game wins!

Sheriff is a different game with every different group you play with, and the role of Sheriff is never safe from crushing loss or lots of gain. We love this game and the bluffing that it provokes from cocky smugglers and honest merchants alike. 

This game is exponentially more fun the more you get into the sheriff/merchant roleplaying. Recently we had a friend who responded to every question from the sheriff with the same smarmy, "Yes/No your Lordship." and "Just a humble merchant, your Lordship." We've also had blustering Sheriffs, timid Sheriffs, and loose cannon Sheriffs that will sometimes open every bag and sometimes let everything pass scot-free. Great fun!

Sheriff of Nottingham really gets people out of their comfort zone in a competitive, but not overly-complicated game. It has great replayability because it doesn't rely on new cards or greater difficulties to stay fresh, but instead changes based on the moods and strategies of the players around the table.

[thing=226065][/thing] [b][BGCOLOR=#00ff99][COLOR=#00ff99]_[/COLOR]8[COLOR=#00ff99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b] - six players is a huge addition! We've played several of the modules both alone and together, and it's been a great experience, freshening up one of our favorites.

[thing=163683][/thing] [b][BGCOLOR=#ff3366][COLOR=#ff3366]_[/COLOR]2[COLOR=#ff3366]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b] - Breaks the core mechanic of the game -- makes people WANT to open your bag now. Too weird, even though it's only one card it is too game-changing. Not a fan, I still have it but it's under my insert for now.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game, but not enough use of all the money tokens. And I have also found that when playing honestly and bringing in no contraband at all you have a much higher point score. Which is a shame because i love to bluff... 

Still a very fun game though
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
LOVE THIS GAME. SO, so much fun.  It is easy to teach and incredibly fun to play.  The artwork on the cards feels rich with color and simplicity.  Not a ten only b/c I would have liked the cards to have a little bit better "feel", it is a minor minor complaint.  And the snaps on the bags feel like they may not last long seeing as this game is going to get a ton of plays.  If you have a fun, non boring group then get this game.

One word opinion?  "FUN!"
Wow, this game is loved by me and my family (and everyone we've played with). The bluffing, the Sheriff rotation between players, the "SNAP!" of the bags, and even the art of the boards and cards all add up to "FUN" for us. One of our kids can't bring herself to lie about what's in her bags, but she's one of the toughest Sheriffs you'll encounter! Such fun! We just laugh and holler and have a great time with this game. What more could you ask for!?
(Oh yes, we sleeved the cards)

Muito, muito divertido. Não é nada dificil imaginar que esse jogo tenha sido criado por brasileiros. A revelação da cara-de-pau de cada jogador logo depois das mentiras contadas é a melhor parte do jogo. Estranho que não possa ser jogado com mais de 5. Há cartas mais que suficientes para isso!

With the right group of players, this game is fabulous.  My normally reticent teen saw us playing a game, jumped right in and was all smiles and yucks for the next hour.  No small feat!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game, but a lot of the victory is reliant on luck of the draw. There seems to be nothing you can do to stop a player from playing honestly and that particular strategy wins games more often than not. The contraband is only worth so much, and to beat the bonuses from the King and Queen end-game point boosts, you need a LOT of contraband. Even players mixing the two strategies win games less often than players going 100% honest. There needs to be some downside to only putting honest goods in your bag, because right now, I could draw 5 Chickens, put them in the bag, and practically win the King's Bonus. There is also no incentive for the player to bribe the Sheriff, so there's no down-side to not giving the Sheriff any money at all and reaping huge benefits anyways.

A game I regrettably haven't played enough of. Or have I? I don't know, maybe I'm bluffing. Actually, I really haven't. Seriously. I want to play this more. Or maybe I'm bluffing again. You'll have to open the bag to really find out.

Sheriff of Nottingham preys upon our curiosity. From the outside looking in, you might think that the pressure is on the merchants to try and sneak some goods through the Sheriff and into their stall/contraband pile. And, for sure, there is pressure on them to do so. But it's really the Sheriff who has to think carefully in all of this. The impulse is just to see what is in the bag. Will the curiosity get the better of the Sheriff or will it be the undoing of the merchant?

It's this sort of free-form negotiation and social deduction that makes Sheriff so fun. The ever-changing landscape of goods and money creates an atmosphere that goes above and beyond any final scoring. In fact, the scoring structure just lends a bit of foundation for what is really just an incredibly fun social activity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Trying to collect sets and the most of something is fun. Trying to sneak a powerful item past can be tense. I like the money aspect.
DISLIKE: Lying and acting is needed, but not as intense as other social party games.

OVERALL: I liked it, but I feel it needs a little bit more strategy or deduction for me to really enjoy it, then straight up guessing. I'd rather play a euro.

The core here is a bluffing game - very much reduced to its essentials. The production values are incredible - the illustrations while few are beautifully done. The quality can be seen as well in the materials - the card bags are essential and well made. All very nice. And the game is easy to explain and easy to play - reasonably quickly as well. So very good for a group of non-gamers who just want to laugh - and there are laughs aplenty in the box. So  it fits an unusual space in my collection. Not a game I enjoy much, but others certainly do.

Reasons why I scored this one as low as I did is because it seems to be very group dependent. Also, every game I have played, the person who got lucky with card draws and told the truth the whole game always won. I still enjoy the game but it does seem to be hit or miss depending on the group you're playing with.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In general, I think it's a glorified game of cheat... yet I think it's good. Better than Coup. I suppose since the penalty for calling one out for possibly cheating is not as bad as in say... Coup, since I did that (and got penalized) and still won. Plus the negotiation can be fun if people do it creatively. Components are really good too, although there are really way too many cards. Otherwise, great game for the type.

RATING: 7.5
The artwork and quality of tiles and coins in this game is top-notch. The plastic button snaps on the plastic/velvet bags suck. We had to abstain from snapping/unsnapping bags (even though the rules encourage it from a signal-of-intent perspective) for fear that we would either rip a hole in the bags or the snaps out of the bags. 

The free app is excellent and adds some great sound effects and Monty Python-esque humor to the proceedings. It also can handle all the MATH required at the end to add up your points. For a game so light and fluffy, the avalanche of math that falls on you at the end to determine winners is a pain. The app lightens this burden.

I had grand hopes of my fun loving, jovial gaming group hopping right into role playing this game, as so many others have said... but something about it caused them not to. It was a very dry, "I have five apples," experience. We didn't need a timer at all we were whipping through rounds so fast. Interestingly, everyone said it was fun, but it wasn't the instant-fun-maker other folks have referred to in their reviews. I still like the game, but maybe I need to find a theater troupe to play it with.

Positives
- Fantastic artwork, quality tiles and coins
- Excellent companion app
- Simple mechanics
- Encourages role-playing

Negatives
- Bags look awesome on the surface, but their cheap quality manifests the first time you try to unsnap them
- Easy to sidestep role-playing and make gameplay very perfunctory and dry
- For such a simple concept, the rulebook is dense with text, technicalities and examples-- which can be good and bad
- Final scoring is very complex in comparison to the game mechanics

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Even if I'm very bad at bluffing, I really think that Sheriff of Nottingham is one of the best games out there for social play. The key of this success is its mix of bluffing and negotiation, which brings out many jokes, discussions, role-playing and so on. It just works really well for that. Yet what makes me enjoy this game even more is the fact that, unlike other bluffing games, there's actually a game beneath all the lying... even if that game is just plain simple set collection. Also is worth mentioning that this game has gorgeous artwork and high quality components. Everything is just really pleasing to watch. 

I would like to give it a higher ranking, but I do have one problem with this game... well, me! The fact that I'm so bad at bluffing and negotiation brings me quite often at making a fool of myself. I know I shouldn't let this fact influence my opinion of the design... but the truth is: even if I'll have fun playing this game, I'll constantly show everybody just how pathetic I'm at bluffing and negotiating. 

Overall a very well put together game, that will probably never fail to create social interactions between the players at the table... I just wish I was a little better at it to be able to enjoy it more.

2nd play: Great game the 2nd time around, and 4 or 5 players both plays well, with 5 being longer, but more bags to inspect. I like the interaction, and I *think* the game will hold up to repeat plays, but it's likely very group dependent.

It's enjoyable to trick your friends and see them trick you or fail miserable at it.

In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!

In general, I don't care a lot for strict negotiation games. But the gameplay in Nottingham is fairly novel. It has a certain charm I like. There's quite a bit of intriguing gameplay in figuring out how / when to bluff or make deals. It's neat, fast, and fun.

Probably one of the best bluffing games I've ever played.

I just wish that they would reduce the amount of ambiguity behind bribing the Sheriff. For example: Is the Sheriff allowed to bait someone by asking for a specific bribe, see that they're willing to pay it and open the satchel anyways?

We've made Sheriff demands binding, but nothing in the rules suggested that, initially allowing for some fairly tense arguments between players.

Only had one game play so far, grade is subject to chaneg, but my gaming group liked it. Not too much, it is different game then we usually play. Here is more about social interaction (bluffing/negotiating) then playing optimal turns so that kind throw them out of loop.

One rule that throwed them off most and i had hard time explaning is declaration phase where you musn't lie about number of cards (don't know why really) and that you can declare only one legal good. First time playing it can be hard to grasp all the possible combinations you could put in bag since you musn't lie about number of cards only. (only one legal good type, multiple legal goods types and mix of both with contraband). I'm sure next time we play we wont have same problems.

I can see the amusement in this game, but I found the complete reliance on luck in a mechanic that I do not particularly like resulted in a rather boring snoozefest of a game with far too much quick repetition. In fact, there really is no game here at all.

RATING: 8
Like so many games of its class, Sheriff is heavily reliant on having no moody douchebags in the group to spoil the fun. This one is excellent. It’s bluffing and negotiation with plenty of game there behind the core concepts. That plastic popping noise makes the game.

Some observations: I would definitely recommend using the accompanying app for a better experience; use the three minute timer without fail. Using the extra-rulesy contraband cards makes for a much better experience when people know what they're doing.

Whenever this hits the table, our group have an absolute blast.

Rarely, it can feel slightly too long.

This is a smuggling goods (cards) past an inspector (rotating from player to player) kind of game, and as such, is dominated by determining when to lie...and when the other players are lying, or telling the truth, about the cards they have secretly placed in their envelopes. On the plus side, the game creates a lot of table talk, and the joy, I suppose, of catching other players when the lie (but not you when you lie). 

On the minus side, the game, turn in and turn out, essentially teaches and rewards lying and getting away with it (best approach), as opposed to lying and getting caught (not as good, but still not too bad) and telling the truth (which might be a decent strategy, but definitely NOT the point of playing this particular game).  

One plays this particular game to enjoy lying and getting away with it, and making lots of money when you do lie.  Hmmmm...I wonder what this game is implicitly teaching its players?  This game straightforwardly fails my "the world would be a worse place if more people played this game test," and so I definitely cannot recommend it.

Lives up to its hype. Has (what I think) VERY simple rules and anyone can pick it up pretty easily. Similar to coup, one of its main flaws is that sometimes playing straight the entire game is better than trying to lie. Still a great game, however, and if people really get into it and bargain well, the mind games make this game always fun.

Very fun. My family of non gamers enjoyed it very much. We laughed a lot. However, the game is only as fun as you make it. This is why I am rating it lower. The game itself is okay, but so much of the fun derives from people "getting into" the medieval time period and pretending to be merchants. If you have people in your group that aren't lively and humorous when playing games, please stay away from this one. If you do have these kinds of people, though, Sheriff of Nottingham is one of the best purchases you can make.

Good bluffing game with some fun negotiations and interactions. Really like the freedom in negotiations to do anything from offer out of the bag to bribing the sheriff to check someone else's bag.

As I originally feared, sometimes it seems like it's in your best interest to never bribe as you don't waste your money and don't give any tells to the sheriff on what you may have in there. This can result in a lot of boring guesswork for the sheriff, who has nothing to base anything off of. For this reason, you probably need the right crowd to make this game work.

RATING: 6
Good party game of bluffing but you have to be playing this with the right group otherwise it will just fall flat.  Hence why I gave this one a 6.  You shouldn't have to play a game with "the right group" of people.  A game should be fun regardless of who is playing.

The sheriff's decisions early in the game seem a bit coinflippy. Maybe after a dozen or so plays, I would develop enough of a strategy to make smart calculated negotiations from the very beginning, but I would really have to invest serious time in playing this game to reach that level, and I'd rather invest this time in a different game. However, it's a fun activity for the right kind of group.

The game is just a blast. Bribing, bluffing, a little of that good old backstabbing of other players, but that does not render it void of some solid mathematical strategy and planning ahead as best you can. The components are top notch, and it's pretty much an ultimate party game for friends that might even be non-gamers, if you have a smaller count (3-5). If this is only the first Dice Tower Essential, I can't wait to see the next...

RATING: 5
While not the most original bluffing/deduction game, it manages to do 3 things very well. First, the art-work and theme makes sense and adds to the overall experience. Secondly, the negotiation rules are well-defined and add mechanics (snapping of the bag) that eliminate any ambiguity or "slow-rolling" a player may do, in order to bend the rules into his/her favor. And finally, the fact that contraband cards are placed above a player creates useful information so players can see how truthful they have been in pass rounds. 

That being said, the game doesn't provide much useful/concrete information to make decisions. In other words, one's intuition/gut-feeling is going to be the driving force behind any decision. As an ice-breaker party game with new players, I like the game quite a bit. But with the same group, it may get tiresome over time.

Component quality was iffy. I love the art work and cardboard components. Unfortunately, it didn't take half a game for one of the merchant bags to rip.

Sheriff is a great game to pull out for a variety of gaming groups. As long as your group buys into bribing, lying, and overall mischief, there is a lot of fun to be had. 

What makes this game for me is the rush of getting away with smuggling contraband, or setting up the long con in being honest until close to the end when you can smuggle a crap-ton of contraband. 

The back and forth between merchant and Sheriff is a must for this game to reach its potential. Since I bought it, SoN has hit the table on more gaming nights than not. 

Also, the folks at Arcane Wonders have top notch customer service!

Simple buffing game, there's not much, if any, control in the game. Offering something to the sheriff means you're taking contraband, so usually the sheriff confiscates that player, so what ends up happening is that no one offers any bribe to the sheriff.

Sheriff of Nottingham is a simple bluffing game: each turn one player is the Sheriff, and other players try to bring goods (legal or contraband) inside the city.

Merchants declare one type of legal good, but can put anything inside their little velvety bags... The Sheriff can decide to let them pass (usually if they are "generous" to him...) or to inspect the bags. If the bag is opened by the Sheriff, goods not declared are discarded and a fine must be paid; but if the merchant did a rightful declaration, the Sheriff is the one who pays.

There is lot of ways one can negotiate, bluff and smuggle. A sort of poker-like metagame thrives since the first turns. And the game is quite enjoyable, even by non-gamers (and even by me, not overly fond of the bluff and not remotely good at bluffing).

Sheriff is a quite good game, and fills a niche not covered by anything else in my collection.

I like this game. Followed Tom's suggestion and was truthful all the way, came in 151, 5 points behind the leader. I guess I fared not as well because I was too trusting at time and over cautious at other times. So I lost more/ did not earn as much when I was the Sheriff. This is definitely going to see more plays for us.

You do need the right group to play this with, which is one that doesn't get too self-conscious about being a bit silly.  I really think this game works best when people start getting into a bit of a role-playing mood with it.  I enjoy the bluffing in it, and its lighthearted art help keeps it from being too tense of a game because it really isn't trying to be.  It does have that satisfying pulling a con feel, and it can be a lot of fun trying to double-bluff someone.  Ultimately, it does get a bit samey, so it doesn't come out all the time.  But if you give it time between plays, it can be a really fun way to change up the gaming time.

Either way, you'll have some great moments with your friends and get a good laugh out of throwing out terrible fake accents. Cheerio'!

BRILLIANT game. Takes the basic idea put forth by very simply bluffing games like B.S., and turns it into a clever card-based game dripping with theme. In addition to lying about what cards your stashing away, you must also exercise the ability to single out which of your friends is lying. If you accuse a truthful person, though, it will end up costing you. Really fantastic.

Hilarious and easy to pick up. Amongst my gaming friends we really enjoy getting into this game with playful voices and adding our own details like claiming our chickens aren't just chickens but prized fighting cockerels from Spain to help encourage the Sheriff to take them. It's own of our favourites and we only get disappointed when we have 6 players and can't play it.

great funny party game.deserves my wishlist status.i enjoyed it quite a bit.

edit lowering from 8 to 6 due the only telling truth tactic
its biased to telling the truth and win.i was trying to smuggle contraband yesterday but it didnt work that much.people just open your bag or you bribe them and its not rental then.

i try it with expansion but the game starts to dissapoint me.

I love bluffing games, and this a very good one. Players are merchants trying to make an honest living bringing wares into the city for trade, and although the Sheriff [i]could[/i] check their bag to make sure they're really bringing the four chickens they say they are, surely that's not neccessary. No, no, really, I don't think it's neccessary to check it. Well, would these three coins here perhaps grease the wheels of bureaucracy? Oh goodness me no, I wouldn't call it [i]bribery[/i], I'm just in a little bit of a hurry and... No! No, don't! I... Er... I have no idea how those crossbows ended up in the bag, sir, really. I swear it was chickens when I packed it. Dreadfully sorry, won't happen again.

A negotiating bribery game. The complexity comes from how creatively can you extort or bluff your friends. Wasn't immediately obvious how open this game could be. I like it more the more I've played it with different kinds of people. When it's at its best, there's a little role playing and lots of in jokes.

This social bluffing game requires just enough tact using its mechanisms that I wouldn't consider it a party game, but is quick enough to learn and easy enough to understand the strategy of to be entry level and entertaining for varying ages. In a nut shell, you take turns being the sheriff and deciding who's goods will pass unchecked and who's will be inspected. The catch is that the goods checked will either reward the sheriff of contraband is found, or penalize the sheriff if the person is being honest. 

One of the unique things about this game is that it's a bluffing game, but choosing to never lie is a completely legitimate strategy, and I've seen people win simply because they didn't lie until the very last round, and pushed 5 contraband in all at once. 

Highly recommend you try this one, espescially if playing with people who will get into the theme and act a bit.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Man, I thought this would actually be fun... and at first it kind of was, but the game is too fragile, and people can break it easily by dumb logic.  This one takes a specific group, and mine probably isn't the right fit.  It also kind of felt a little long for what it was.  They added the market phase to add a bit of strategy, but it really slows the game down.  One I don't see sticking around...

Didn't own but have played.

Firstly, there's a huge difference if your gaming group wants to 'role-play' the interactions.  If they do not, I wouldn't even bother picking up the game at all.

Secondly, in my opinion this game gets old very quickly.  It's simply a bluffing game and that's really about all there is to it.  Even with groups who want to role-play it I think it'll stop hitting the table fairly quickly compared to other games and I think much of the hype surrounding it is just that: hype.

Simple and fun game all about lying, bluffing, extortion, and bribery. Of course it's going to be fun

Each player takes turns being the Sheriff and every other player tries to put goods in their bag to take to the market. The Sheriff gets to choose to inspect each bag, if there are illegal goods they get confiscated and the offender must pay a fine, but if it's legitimate the Sheriff must pay the fine. The trick is, you can bribe the Sheriff to not check your bag. This leads to a wonderful, unique game all about extorting and trying to double bluff people.

A fun game, where players make most of the game itself. Therefore, it needs players set at having fun more than counting points towards victory.

RATING: 8
This game is really fun and typically hilarious, even more so if you're playing with interesting people, but there's two problems that might arise after multiple play throughs:
1) If you're playing with the same people over and over, you'll become so accustom to the way they barter and bluff that the game gets extremely repetitive. So recruiting interesting people to play with is crucial, because you need people that can regularly switch up their bluffing tactics.
2) Even if you are able to regularly switch up your bluffing tactics, there always comes a point where your group can predict how you'll act in any given situation. It's near impossible to play this game with the same group of people without it eventually getting repetitive, there's no way to get around the fact that this game will get repetitive if you're not playing with multiple different groups of people.

Otherwise, this is an excellent game, albeit, one with limited replay value.

Fantastic bluffing game.

Being the sheriff is more stressful than I thought it would be and I love either trying to sneak in contraband or get the sheriff to open a bag of full of legitimate goods. 

Sheriff of Nottingham takes the best part of bluffing games (looking each other in the eye and trying to deduce if the other person is lying or not) and makes that 75% of what you do in the game.

All that and a near perfect production make this one of the top bluffing games out there.

The only downside is that it can drag if people don't keep things moving.

Excellent and fresh design. Impressed by first playing, would like to play again soon. Update: My initial concerns were that honesty wins to often but that is clearly not the case. Great clever well balanced game with all the features I like of strong interaction, fresh mechanics, rich theme, low downtime and fast playing. People rating this game as purely a binary bluffing game of being caught or not are really only playing half a game, negotiation and other subtle elements create a rich multi-layered experience. This is what really makes the game a 10 for me and adds a whole new dynamic to it.

I feel like this game would need to be played several times in a row with the same group to get interesting, but the game play itself isn't interesting enough for us to play more than once... besides getting bored there doesn't ultimately seem to be any benefit to being dishonest.

After more plays I'm only keeping this because my 7yo likes it, and unlike his siblings he usually hates boardgames so it's nice to have one he will actually play with the rest of us. What makes this game fun is at complete odds with what it takes to win.

The Draw-Phase (refilling hands) combined with the way the discard piles are treated kills the pacing of the game. The way the Sheriff must remember every kind of visible card the players pick up is a bit gamey and annoying. 

There's been a lot of discussion whether Honest play is unbalanced. According to my experience it is, or at least, it incentivizes people from taking risks, which is a shame because it reduces the chaotic atmosphere. And don't even mention the bonus point counting. It's just tedious beyond belief. I don't want to spend minutes comparing cards back and forth with everyone for the game to end, I want to play again!

I might try the Zee-Garcia-variant where there is only one face down discard pile, no end-game bonuses, no drawing from discard pile and a 6 or 7 card hand limit. It should encourage (and force) players to take more risks and raise the stakes for bribing.

It's a great bluffing game. We had a lot of fun. 
Everyone was trying to corrupt the Sherrif to open, or not open a bag. It really feels like poker, but in a much more fun way, as all the players can interact at the same time.

EDIT: A bit long may be, and very chaotic. Plus the end game is a bit anti-climatic

Unbelievably fun bluffing game.  Quick, fast paced, and full of laughs.  Great at creating memories.

It has that same core joyous mechanism of lying to your buddy's face, but it forces the issue by making you have to hand over goods and look your opponent in the eye.  It's a direct and more confrontational version of Coup in some ways.

What a super game.  Super simple and light, but with enough going on that it just absolutely works.  I got the app after the first play, but we didn't have any problems keeping the game moving, so I don;t know if I will add it next time.  Even the point scorer in the app seems like it might just be quicker for us to do it by hand, and more fun see who won what crowns for bonuses...  The lying and bluffing could go in so many directions and I am interested to see how this plays out in different groups.  Fantastic!

This one is quite fun, it's a lightweight bluffing game with a fun theme. The idea is that you are trying get legal goods and contraband into Nottingham, past the Sherif. Declare what you're bringing in, if you get caught in a lie, it's going to cost you. Great artwork, fun fitting theme, and the mechanics fit as well.

Maybe the most repetitive game I have ever played. An hour of doing the same thing over and over again. And the winner comes down to a spreadsheet scoring exercise. 

To me, it is basically broken that it can easily be won without ever taking risk, or very little. It needs the players to play badly for the fun to creep in. 

Bluffing games need for there to be some logic to be applied. A game like poker is basically a big logic puzzle. This game is just guesswork. It isn't a horrible game to play, but endless better games in its niche.

Cool fillery type bluffing game of collecting goods. A lot of this game depends on the group it is played with, some players may not gravitate toward the bluffing mechanic.

A very good party game to play with chatty friends, watch them bribe each other and argue is my favorite moment of this game. The joy of the game is highly dependent on whom you play with.

Regard to strategy depth, the benefit of bribing & smuggling is not so significant from "always tell the truth and get your goodies passed and maybe sometimes collect some fine from the sheriff", make the game a little bit imbalance.

RATING: 5
A pure bluffing game where all you are trying to do is get sets of goods past the sheriff while trying to sneak contraband as they score many more points than the regular goods. The sheriff goes around the table twice and that's the game. Scoring is based on goods successfully passed by the sheriff and bonus points for having the most in each set. My problem is the game is entirely too long 75 minutes for a 5-player game where you do the same thing in round 1 as round 10 just makes it drag. Part of that is because I am not a huge fan of bluffing, but I do enjoy it in quicker games like Bang: Dice or Incan Gold. Glad I got to play it, but not one I'm eager to play again.

Fun and hilarious, especially if players really get into the bribing and bluffing elements of the game. One thing gamers may like or dislike about the game is that every decision can have a big impact on players' final scores, to the extend that one successful bribe or wrongfully searched bag can sometimes mean the difference between first and last place.

Had a wonderful time with 5.  The bluffing system takes a bit of getting in to, but our group went through phases of trying different tactics of bluffing, telling the truth, double bluffing, and just flat out bribery to earn points.  Seemed to be a hit and really quite simple to learn too.  It seems you need to know the sheriff a bit when making your bid, their different styles really make it so you can't have a win-all strategy.

Fun and entertaining. The rules are a simple set up for the bluff, which is where the game really shines. Although you can easily play it straight, and earn a respectable score, the game is well-balanced to tempt you with the extra easy coin you get pick up from smuggling - assuming you get away with it of course.
The game really benefits by laying some ground rules for the bluff/bribe stage and then leaving the rest up to you. The simple mechanic of having your cards in pouches make it clear when a bribe has been accepted or not and helps avoid any arguments.
I played this with my wife and young daughters and it works well as a fun family game which we all enjoyed. I definitely get the impression that 4 or 5 players are better than 3.

An absolutely solid bluffing game, with tightly interwoven smuggling mechanics. I can see why the goods cards are made fun of, but... the entire thing works, and works well. Perhaps a few too many contraband cards are included in the mix. I very much like the two separate discard decks, BUT... a pet peeve of mine was comitted by the publisher: a preorder bonus promo, that no-one knows if it was attached to ALL international preorders - or none...

A hit with the immediate (non-gaming) family, especially after a few drinks.

I really enjoyed this bluffing game.  Bluffing is a mechanism that I really enjoy and it is at the heart of this game.  You try to get contraband goods past the Sheriff and all players get a turn at being the Sheriff twice during the game.

My only complaint is that playing it safe 100% of the time seems to be a bit too strong of a strategy, but maybe that's an issue more with my group than the game itself.  I would rate this a bit higher, but the game does seem to take a tad too long for what it delivers.  Liar's Dice can provide a similar thrill in a fraction of the time.  There will still be a place for this on my shelf, though, as the theme this delivers over a game like Liar's makes it worthy enough to hit the table every now and then.

Before heading to a game night, one of my friends said "I'm really in a mood to play a bluffing game where a rich dude is exploiting other people for their money." I knew what I had to do.

Sheriff is ridiculous. My sister pretty much always beats me by playing it completely straight the whole game. I've heard this is a common winning strategy, and that seems to go against what the game is trying to be. But otherwise it's just pure theater, which could be what you're looking for in between bigger games.

That said, I don't think it's the best social game ever made (that title currently goes to Coup), and I've found it gets stale pretty quickly. Still, it's an entertaining thing that can show people what modern board gaming can be all about.

Pretty fun, though strategy is highly dependent on the group. The one I played with was pretty willing to let goods in, so there was a lot of bluffing, but in a more discerning group, I can see how important it is to be law-abiding. The money collected from bribes seem to be a very big factor, which makes the majorities slightly underwhelming, but definitely fosters cutthroat negotiation.

What a fun time. The family all enjoyed it. The bluffing mechanism makes the game. Everyone is naturally suspicious of large bags, so it is very hard to get through contraband and goods. 2 cards seems to be the best way to get through contraband. If you can get a set of 4 or 5 you will be checked and make some more cash(priority).

Depending on your group, this game could either go over amazingly well, or bomb. Personally, I've had amazing success with this game. My group and I played this a good 3 times in a row the first time we ever opened it.

The best part about this game is you don't even need to lie. You could be completely honest for the entire game and win the whole thing.

If you are looking for a light game that is great among casual and hardcore gamers, this game is for you.

n Sheriff of Nottingham, you live the high glamorous life of a customs agent, patrolling the borders of Nottingham seeking contraband that might be sold on the open market.  Sure, he may say he's a harmless chicken farmer, but those bags aren't exactly moving and clucking all that much.  But you might be convinced to not take a peek... for a fee.

Interesting Mechanic: bribery.  Sheriff of Nottingham is, at it's core, a game about lying, bribery and mutual understandings, wink wink nudge nudge.  You fill a bag with goods and declare the contents of them, and pass them to the current Sheriff.  The Sheriff then decides whether or not your bags merit closer inspection, and that decision might be made easier with a donation to local law enforcement, which is woefully underfunded by an underappreciative public.  If he looks and you have contraband, you're in trouble, but the penalties are staggering if his instincts are wrong.  But don't get too cocky - eventually you will take your turn as the Sheriff.

Sheriff of Nottingham is, at it's core, a social game, and is far better in a group that is extroverted, silly and familiar with each other.  It is a tad prone to lucky streaks - a player can get so lucky drawing goods that he rarely or never needs to lie - but this is a relatively quick game where the experience is generally more valuable than winning or losing anyway.

I don't see what all the fuss is about with this game.
It's fun to get into character, and bluff/lie about what cards you're giving another player. And ..... yeah, that's it. Then you score. And then they do it to you.
Oh, and the bribe. Well, there's that.
I suppose it's all in how "meta" the game gets, which can make it fun. Maybe I'm just not in a very Nottinghamy kinda place.

I had seen a lot on this one, but never pulled the trigger.  With 15k ratings on BGG, it is a popular game.  

There are layers and layers of bluffing (or not).  You can go through the whole game and win without a single bluff.  My favorite is telling the truth and bluffing to get the sheriff to pay you.  

Still need to figure out how and when to smuggle contraband best.

RATING: 7
Thus far, my favorite "lie your lying face off" (aka "bluffing") game I've found. Not a genre I enjoy playing too much - I find them slightly stressful - but it can be fun once in a while. The incentives in this one are really nicely balanced to incentivize deception, bluffing, and negotiation with a lovely imbalance: one side has all the information, the other side *may* have all the power.

Seems to naturally encourage a light touch of roleplaying and just the right sort of light-hearted grudges and vendettas - whenever the sheriff searches, someone gets burned.

Highly recommend playing with an N-minute timer on the bargaining round. Moderately recommend some sort of convention as to whether each search is happening (we used "is the snap on a pouch open at the moment the timer runs out?")

RATING: 6
No real complaints about this game, given what it is. I think in awhile its score will drop to 5, but for now I think a 6 is fair.

The game is light, and without the sort of strategy I enjoy to my highest rated games. I like face to face challenge, and having to be social in games in order to pull off a win, but I also like having some system or possible deeper strategy that allows for trumping any opposition at certain times in a game if you set yourself up right. This was a pretty much straight up bluff game in which you sort of pattern analyze your stakes, gauge your lead (or amount you are behind) versus the player who is the sheriff and secondarily the other players.

This is just light fun. It doesn't overstay its welcome- game length is good. Scoring is interestingly complex at the end, but in thinking about it, it is a fitting system for the game and helps it to feel fair when all is said and done.

No real criticisms to take away points, no real "wow" parts to add extra. So, there ya go.

RATING: 7
Sheriff of Nottingham is a game I enjoy because I am a fan of bluffing games, and Sheriff of Nottingham is a game that presents a platform for bluffing that is very unique.

The conceit of the game is straightforward and quick to pick up after a round or two, but the core of the game comes during the exchange between Sheriff and Trader. Initially, it seems almost basic - the trader must try to smuggle in contraband, and the sheriff must decide if they'll accept bribes or promises to turn a blind eye. What gives the game depth is the fact that bringing in nothing but legitimate goods means that a Sheriff who searches your bag must pay a penalty. This lends depth to the amount of moves a player can make, and leads to hilarious "you think that I think that YOU think" moments as players try to untangle each others' motives.

There are a couple of shortcomings, unfortunately. One is that score is not easily determined or kept during the game, and instead must be sorted out at the end of the game with pens and paper. While this is true of a lot of games, Sheriff of Nottingham is a bit egregious - I've once seen a game take 20 minutes to calculate with inexperienced players. The other is that the game itself tends to run out of steam near the end; the gameplay doesn't really change up at any point, so if you don't enjoy the core loop, you're going to find this a drag.

Overall though, I've greatly enjoyed my time with Sheriff of Nottingham, and I would recommend it to anyone enjoys bluffing and deception

RATING: 9
Great bluffing and social deduction game. Makes for some truly hilarious moments especially if players are willing to get into their characters and role play a little. I would say the play time runs shy of the 60 min playtime. experienced players could probably knock it out in 30 mins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Deals, bluffs, threats and bribes can be made, and this is heart of the game. If the Sheriff opens the bag and is wrong, they pay the merchant, but if the merchant is lying they pay a fine and lose cards. Sheriff of Nottingham is round after round of hilarious bluffing for young and old.

willing to play again to further explore the game but not too impressed fte rfirst game.

I'd actually claim that it might be incorrect to call ti a "bluffing game", yes, it has bluffing elements, but depending on how it's played, the core mechanism might actually be "bribing", as a combination of trading and negotiating (with some hidden information and bluffing thrown in),

I'm also not impressed by the components and the huge dekc of cards. I'm sure it must have been possible to have a similar kind of game with a smaller deck size (perhhaps not allowing as many goods to be placed in a pouch?).

One of my favourite games, however this is the kind of game that very much relies on a good atmosphere to get the most out of.

VERY good game: simple yet engaging, easy yet fun.
Much can be said about how winning is easiest if you just tell the truth all the time, but - honestly - why play the game in such a boring way just to win. As overly serious I am taking many games, in this one I just don't care much for who gets first (which is a good thing in this case).

The little pouches obviously make the game SO much better, the haptic element of clicking open the bag is brilliant.

That all said, it only gets a 7-8 - not because there is something inherently wrong with it but just because of my preferences. I do prefer heavier games, and after playing Sheriff a lot of times I grow more and more ambivalent to it - but I suppose that can and will potentially happen to every game that you play more often than you'd like because it's a 'crowd pleaser'

Very fun, easily taught and played, and accessible to a wider variety of "non-gamers" if you have a group of people that don't get into the strategy type games.  The Art is excellent, and it's a great twist on the "Bull#@%!" style games.  I have found that the "honest" player has more luck with winning than the people trying to smuggle in the high value goods.  Really tests your ability to read people.

It was fun but I'm pretty sure that had more to do with our group of untrustworthy fellows than the game itself. Literally, I feel like you could be playing the game of "Do I have a quarter in my hand" and it would have been as fun. It's a game of lying to your friends face and hearing him snap open a pouch to try and catch you dead to rights.

Speaking of components, the pouch is a delight. The cards are awful. Not the cardstock, but the layout. There is no natural way to splay the cards so you get all the information you can while they're in the market. It irked me to no end. In most games, you splay cards from west to east. In this game, you have to splay them from south-west to north-east. Lame.

Rated after 3 plays @ 5 players

The game is easy to explain and doesn't take much to get started. Make sure to follow the 1 min timer per player on the sheriff to keep the game moving and don't forget there are plenty of ways other than money to make a bribe. I found that going with the honest strategy worked pretty well in the first game. By the third, the honest strategy wasn't earning enough money so I needed to take more risks with contraband.

I would play again but the game really needs the higher player count (4 or 5) to work. Less than that and it loses some of the chaos and dynamics that make it fun.

I'm finding this one to be a little too random and loose and like The Resistance, the bluffing gets a little old after awhile. 

[March 2015 - 7]
I was at the grocery the other day and got some donuts in a bag, did my other shopping and went to checkout line where the lady asked me what was in the bag to ring it up. I had to pause and think a minute -- "uh, five donuts," which was true. I laughed to myself as it reminded me of this game, when you have that moment of "oh crap, what's in my bag" -- the pause can sometimes give away a lie ... or a bluff.

This is a fun party game. Everyone gets it and enjoys it, it moves along quickly, etc. There's also some strategy and player interaction for the race to the top of the items. That, in itself, adds a layer to the game to keep it from being "meh" to "okay, I have to pay attention here and make it a race."

Bluffing game where you're a merchant trying to get a wagon full of legitimate goods or contraband past a Sheriff with bribes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Once you see the merchants, you're curious. Once you see the contraband you're engaged. Once you see the bags, your sold. 

Every time I've taught Nottingham, it comes to life.

And importantly, Nottingham works because it is inherently human! This isn't a game where I have to explain that "it's so cool because the interface of abstract systems all make a rich and compelling puzzle." No! Nottingham does that with first impressions! 

There's inherit joy in the actions of the game. We want to open up the bag and see whats inside. We want to accept bribes. We want to lie to our friends in the open and get away with it. 

We want to be together and screw each other over. It's beautiful, and I can play it with anyone.

The bluffing past the customs officer game of [thing=3705][b]Contraband[/b][/thing], with haggling/negotiation added, and a majority holdings scoring system added to the end.  Too long for what it offers, mainly due to the negotiation aspect.  Fun at the base level, but needed some development to trim the length.  Contraband scratches the itch perfectly well.

Highly recommended.  Great fun for a group, whether they enjoy acting the part or just relish being an agent of chaos.  Quality components, lots of laughs, straightforward rules, and a theme that works.  And when one member of my gaming group was a bit overzealous in unsnapping a bag and broke the snap, Alfiya at Arcane Wonders did not hesitate to make me a very happy customer and replaced the component for me.

A game of lies and bribery. This one is always a hit with my gaming group. I feel that the more players are willing to get into character and role play, the better the game is.

RATING: 6
I think I like the idea of this game more than I enjoy it in practice.  I think my issue is that the incentive system for bluffing seems to be off.  I will try to sneak things through because hee-hee I'm being sneaky, but I don't know that the game mechanisms really encourage that properly.  I think it works better if you are making deals with the Sheriff, but even then there are better dealmaking games.  I think Coup does a better job of creating a good framework for bluffing.  In fact, SoN makes me feel uncomfortable because it somehow feels much more like lying than bluffing.

I am constantly disappointed in my game group for not finding the fun in this game, as I always have a blast with it. It's been said in many reviews, but the feeling of having the current sheriff holding your bag of goods as you attempt to negotiate a deal, only to have him snap it open at the end, is excellent.

To those who claim that it's 'always better to tell the truth,' I would argue this is expressly false for your group, if that's the agreed mindset. If everyone believes that the smartest option is to tell the truth, then it's that much easier to get prohibited goods through. The mindset will encourage the playing of the other mindset.

Sheriff of Nottingham is a great example of gaming as Entertainment. You have some items and you want to get them through 'customs'. You lie and negotiate with the Sheriff so that you get stuff through, or he searches you and you pay a fine.

That is about it. The scoring is a rather annoying fiddley thing based around set collecting, and it sits at odds with the rather free-flowing neotiation game. It is also a little long for a light game.

And there does seem to be an easy option of simply telling the truth at all times. This negates the negotiation aspect of the game and does seem to produce a winning formula. And the game falls a little flat without negotiation and bluffing.

So if you and the rest of your group like table-talk, and negotiation games with the chance to lie and bluff your way through, then this will work well.

Great for friends reunions. Sheriff of Nottingham is a party game with a lot of acting and fun. And is a game that you can play with your non-board gamers friends because is all about jokes and bluffing.

The goal is to bluff cheating or telling the truth, to obtain goods (they're goods ones like bread or cheese, and others not, like cross bone). 

If your friends are open to talking, this game is great, if your friends are a little passive and don't talk too much, then the game is gonna be ok, but not great. Try the game, giving a lot of effort the first time you show the game, make a good sheriff character and then the game gonna be fluent and entertaining.

This game was fun first few times I played and I played with different people. One player is a sheriff who inspects the bags of other players who are merchants. Lying is penalized as well as opening the bags of innocent merchants. Then the role of the sheriff switches to other player. It is fun, but it is too much dependent on the human factor and after 3 games it started not to offer anything new. It is fun only if we really really try. I am keeping it because it can really refresh the table sporadically.

Pretty much what the rating says - Not so good, it doesn't get me, but could be talked into it on occasion.

That sums it up nicely.

I'm pretty good at steering away from the hype machine, but when 3 tables at the same group are running this game, I have to at least sit down and give it a whirl or two, which I did.  As a party game, I think it's fine and I will be fine filling a seat at the table.  As a game game, though?  Big ol' meh.  I'm not entirely sure where the high rating comes from, but I think the price of admission is too high for what this game is.  It looks great, sure.  Art is fantastic, cards are great stock, little snap bags are wonderful... but it's all a bit... overdone?

Such as it is, the play reminds me of a card game I played in school called Cheat, which was less about the game and more about the people playing it.  I guess with the right group (and we had a good slice of people, mind you), it's a rollicking good time, but left to its own devices, I dunno.  I was just bored.

This is a bluffing game that is somewhat similar to the card game BS or Liar's Dice.  It's a bit more complex and has more layers than either of those.  

Players take turns being the Sheriff and all of the other players hands him/her a bag full of goods.  The players all declare what they have in the bag and it is up to the Sheriff to decide if they wish to inspect it.  If an inspected bag contains contraband there are fines to be paid; likewise if an inspected bag matched what was declared, the Sheriff must pay a penalty.  Players are free to wheel and deal and bribe the Sheriff to allow their bags to pass.  

The is a fun bluffing game full of mind games and reverse psychology.  Of course, you can always choose to play it honestly, but it isn't always the best policy.  

A minor quibble is that the end game scoring can be a little work.  However, this does not detract from the fun of the game itself.  The game plays with a minimum of 3, but definitely seems more fun with 4 or 5.  Recommended!

This game has been known to start couples fighting at our game nights... which is exactly what you want from a party game built around lies and bribery! Interesting to watch different groups play styles based on the outside dynamics of the group; however this can lead to people not being aggressive enough with checking bags, meaning very large scores at the end.

More sensitive than most games to having a fun-loving group, but they don't have to be so skilled in deceit to have fun.    

Simple, fast, great group experience.  If you're terrible at lying you can speak only the truth and still generally do pretty well, and perhaps a little bend and bribe here and there wouldn't hurt?  Those who want to role-play a bit more can add some banter to bring it to life for all.

The art is good, and the snappy pouches a great touch.

- having the option to bribe the sheriff or accept bribes as sheriff
- the pretty velvet bags

I dislike:
- the insert--it's not very helpful in keeping things properly organized/in place!
- that there's only ONE female and FOUR male characters to play... in a modern board game
- that it's not that difficult to see through the yellow bag...

Final verdict: Love playing the game, but I'm terrible at telling if I'm being lied to by the other players, and I wish the game was more fair in representing both sexes. Up for trade.

The fact you can lie or be honest and still do well is great. But. The play group can determine how well this game goes over. It also requires a lot of end game calculation and the amount a player will gain, the amount to bribe and penalties received seem to take a group better acquainted with the game to seem like they have real meaning.

+ I love bluffing, deduction, and negotiation so this game was made for me!  
+ Great theme, lots of fun.  Always a ton of laughs as friends get caught lieing.  It's something different and engaging.
- I wish the gameplay changed up between rounds/turns somehow.

A renamed and available in UK version of Robin Hood.... might actually be able to get my hands on it then.
I have already purchased a copy... now eagerly awaiting October when it will actually arrive :)

Yay!

It finally arrived, after pre-ordering with my FLGS in August, this finally arrived.

I am so excited by this neat little bluffing, set collection game I cant wait to give it a go.

I didn't get my pre-order promo :soblue:

Really really enjoyed this neat little bluffing game, I left the promo pack at home :blush:. so we stripped out the royal bonus cards too and played the base game with no frills. 

I really really enjoyed it. The dual discard piles make for a very interesting card draw mechanic however the contraband cards in said discard piles quickly make it difficult to draw thus you tend to draw blind, which in turn makes it harder for the sheriff to detect your bluffs as he has no idea what you drew.

Whilst I did enjoy this with thee player I think it will really shine with the full compliment of five players and I hope it will become a staple of our game group.
The only complaint I have, and it is a little niggle is that the little market goods bags are very stiff to open and close and I am concerned that the popper will actually tear free of the bag and then I will cry :cry:

Played with 5 people.

Rules are very straight forward, I would give them a once over and then begin play with the rulebook nearby just to answer some questions.  Play is fairly quick and most games we had ended in under 40 minutes even with five people.  I would suggest making some additional house rules if you feel it is too simple. 

Game is very simple and plays easily.  Replay isn't sky high but I think this is a good warmup game to get people talking before a longer session.

Pros
-Somewhat promotes role playing
-Flexible bluffing fun
-Lots of variety of goods
-Players have lots of options and choices on what to do on their turn / how they want to play 

Cons
-Telling truth seems too viable, undermines the lying aspect of the game
-Illegal goods seem underwhelming
-Only one resource limits degree of negotiation/trade available
-Bribing feels very mathy (calculating profit etc)
-Deciding whether or not if someone is lying feels very much like just guessing, despite having some information, there isn't very many tells.

I had a lot of fun. It feels like middle ground between a game like resistance/onuw (short and sweet) and bsg (fun but long). This is not a hidden identity game it's a pure negotiation game but I still get to call people liars and lie myself so it feels similar.

Sheriff of Nottingham is basically a pimped edition of the old game Contraband, with players trying to smuggle stuff past the Sheriff (in this case) with him being (more or less) fully aware that he's being duped but getting his cut. A pure bluffing game, in other words. Improvements over the old incarnation include upgraded components and a shorter playtime, but I still think it takes a bit too long. For a pure bluffing game, it's bloddy hard to beat out something so simple as Cockroach Poker. All the added fluff basically just extends the playtime without adding much to the game.

Boy, this is one of those games that is really group dependent. Not that every game isnt group dependent in its own way. But, this feels more so. I felt that to really make this game sing, every person at the table has to be into character, getting rowdy...willing to be sneaky. There were certain people at my table that refused to smuggle even one item in...I dont know, breaks the game. EEH, I dont hate this...I really dont. But, man getting it to the table is just going to be a struggle. I think Id rather watch the internet people play it, and live vicariously through them! haha...sad, i know.

Fun game that I would not have a problem playing regularly but I still believe the bonus points at the end really hurt the bluffing potential of this game. Why would I need to try and get illegal goods in when I can get 4 cheeses and get the extra points for being the one with most cheeses at the end?

The scoring at the end takes too long, but this game is played less to win (although you obviously try) but more for the role playing in trading and pretending (or not pretending) to lie to get your contraband past - its an ok game worth keeping for a unique feel (Rating 6.847, Nov 16

I have this at a 6.5 and it might be still too high. I feel the game is off on the value of the contraband to the point there is no point ever lying other than to actually make the game fun. Basically it is fun not to try to win but to try to get contraband through. If you want to win you will never send contraband through or lie. In every game I have played that is who has won.

I really don't like bluffing on games, but there are some games where lying is well attached to the gameplay, just like The Resistance for example. In Sheriff of Nottingham, that's is all you have to do, bluff some turns and other turns just say the truth but as if you were lying. So the whole game is around that and I traded after 3 plays. But it's a four because it has nice components and art. I recommend it to be played only with 4 or 5 players and as a casual game with some drinks on the table, hehe.

A perfectly interesting bluffing game that works very nicely and keeps the bluffing/negotiation tactics pure. There's nothing really that heavy here - it's just good ol' fashioned bluffing but done in a real neat way. Some odd things here and there in regards to the value of Contraband (in my opinion) but I'm sure there is a good reason. Overall, a simply fine game!

We never really took from the discard piles because they were nearly all contraband. Also, no one was willing to take bribes as the Sheriff. Need to play again with a different group.

To me, this game is broken. There is so little incentive to try and sneak contraband (reward/risk ratio is just too low). They should be worth more coins or there should be a king and queen of contraband.
You are trying to get 8 coins worth of illegal goods through? Simply bribe the Sheriff and give him 3 or 4 coins. But why not just get 4 coins worth of legal goods through then ? You'd get even more if the Sheriff opens your bag and it builds towards the king and queen rewards.
In my opinion, this game does not reward bluff enough and games can get dry as the group quickly becomes a bunch of honest merchants passing honest goods. Not that fun if you ask me. But who am I to say..

First play. I was skeptical at first, but was quickly won over, and in fact laughed as hard as I have laughed in years. I tend to be skeptical of hype, but this game is a winner with us (a casual/social group), and for a good price.

Kind of a distilled bluffing game--you'll need to work on a game face here, and it's good to get into character. "Hello sheriff, I have some apples here to bake two pies for my mum." Some of the deals people make feel a little broken to me--if you let me through this time, I'll let you through next time--but all in all, we're happy to pull this one out from time to time. It's not something you'd want to play too frequently.

My family purchased Sheriff of Nottingham in Barnes & Noble and found that we got a copy that was missing two types of cards.  I sent an email to Arcane Wonders and within 24 hours received a response.  A few days later, they had sent us a full set of replacement cards with some bonus cards as well.  It was such a pleasure dealing with a company that takes care of its customers.   My family enjoys playing the game very much.  It's something even our littlest one can join in.  My kids are looking forward to teaching their grandparents to play soon.  Thank you Arcane Wonders for a great game and even better customer service!

Bluffing game using set collection and the opportunity to negotiate before revealing the bluff.  There may not be a huge space to explore with this game, but there's some poker style bluffing where you want to plan your bluff based on the amount at stake, and how you're doing in the set collection majorities. It pulled us in and went straight to our buy list.

12/10/15 - First play last week. Provisional 7, as I think that's where this game will end up. It shines as a negotiation game -- the smuggling setup just creates a status quo from which your negotiations begin. This will not be a good game for people who do not like the give and take. The atmosphere is improved through the iOS app's random statements.

A very group dependent game. Fortunately, I have no issue finding people that can get invested in a game like this. The components are fantastic and there is a lot of depth available for those willing to explore. For example, I recommend trying the corrupt sheriff route and letting contraband through for a good sized bribe. It is great.

My daughter received this from a friend for her birthday, so we borrowed it from a friend first to see if she would like it.  I played it first with my lunchtime game group (with some of the rule details wrong), and enjoyed it.  

Played it last night with my wife and two oldest kids.  The younger, almost 8, took a few rounds to understand what he was supposed to be doing, and made some ... interesting decisions ("I'm always going to open every bag."  "I'll give you 20 gold not to open my bag"), but he thought it was a blast, and somehow ended up in 1st or 2nd place for all of the goods.  My daughter was very conservative (usually only taking 1 or 2 goods), but wanted to play another round to try being sneaky.  She was doing well until she gave away that 20 gold that she'd just received...and lost by a point to my wife.  It was a very different experience, but a lot of fun.  She liked it enough to keep it, and any game that those two kids will play together (for now at least) is a winner in my book.

As with Betrayal at House on the Hill, I really want to like this game. Unlike BaHotH though, this time it's more my fault rather then the games issues holding it back.

My biggest problem with Sherrif of Nottingham is that I'm quite bad at bluffing. At first I tried to role-play this game but that really fell pretty flat with the different people I played with. Most of the time people had more success by trying a Euro approach, offering a reasonable amount to pass illegal goods. This approach still didn't work for me though. Probably because I'm too easy to read and people just opened my bag when I tried to bribe them. 

The game doesn't have a catch-up mechanic (aside from going big on contraband) and the theme is pretty thin. Because of this I didn't have that much fun when I was losing. Essentially the drier this game gets (more emphasis on calculation rather then flamboyant deception) the more annoyed I got when I fell behind.

The game has an insert (hooray!) but some of the components are a bit meh. The Sherrif standee showed signs of wear and tear after the first game. More problematic is that people didn't dare opening the bags out of fear or ripping them apart. The snapping sound is cool but pointless if people just leave the flap down without actually closing the bag.

Great concept and cool components. Nuanced social interactions in this game, and I really like that everyone gets to be he sheriff (as opposed to one player being the bad guy all game long).

However, I have found that the negative feelings from this game take a bit to fade away after the game ends. I ended up selling it for this very reason. I don't want to feel worse after a game night.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun bluffing game. Might do better in a 5-player game if everyone only were sheriff once.

The last player in the circle has a different dynamic to contend with, which is that everyone else is more inclined to 'go big or go home' with their bluffs because the game-end is coming right up. Of course, that creates opportunity, too, for negotiation.

Negotiation is interesting. Our group used mostly gold at first—and then I forced a transition to using inventory in the bag and then planning for that by stuffing my bag with contraband, thinking I would give some of it away to the sheriff.

Might actually be a lot of fun to try again.

Sheriff is a bluffing and set collection game enhanced by small envelope bags. Players each get a chance to bluff and to play the sheriff equally, all wondering what is in these hidden envelopes and how to get the sheriff to not open yours...most of the time. The game can be fragile in that the bluffing depth is reliant on the players and the table, but if the table works together this is a great bluffing game where the "nonsense" clicks.

The game works as intended, I suppose, but it's all about bluffing and negotiation, with some set collection for majority scoring. Player interaction occurs via bribing the current sheriff, with various opportunities for kingmaking. As the sheriff, the decision to call a bluff comes most often to pure guessing. I acknowledge that it's not my kind of game, but a bit of actual strategy wouldn't have hurt it.

Nagyon jó kis játék, de teljesen társaság függő.

Ez adja meg a játék igazi zamatát. Ha nem akarsz füllenteni, akkor játssz másik játékot, mert csak az élményt rombolod!

This is the exact kind of game I love to play. It's essentially of gateway weight, and yet it is nasty enough that only certain gamers will really get into it. This is a game almost entirely of bluffing and psychology, with just a dash of tactical play. Outwitting an opponent entirely feels great. GETTING outwitted entirely, not so much. Personally, I live for the moments of "being outwitted" as well, but I can see why people might think this game just makes them feel stupid. Others complain that the bartering process takes too long (or needs to be restricted with a timer) when, in my mind, there's no such thing as too long of a bartering session. As I said, this game is exactly for people like me: liars.

Very fun and very thematic. Bluffing is a mechanic i very much enjoy and both being the Sheriff and attempting to figure out who is trying to sneak illegal goods by you as well as trying to pull a fast one on the other go round. 2 full rounds is a good number to get the game done in about 45 minutes without it becoming stale. Amount of fun had dictates on how much fun group is willing to take with the theme.

Played at Salt Con.  I rather enjoyed this one after we digested the rules (all new players to the game).  Like any interaction-heavy game, this requires involvement from the "right" group of players but can be very fun given that context.

I wish the cards/points would've been streamlined.. somehow it seems clunky.. waiting for every player to decide which cards to get rid of, wich cards to take.. that's pretty boring, but takes up half of the game time.
Still good.

Pretty interesting mechanic with the right group.

The lying part can seem quite fun at first. Inter player-trolling with so-called 'I'll pay you to check someone else' may add some flavour to this game but once people work out how much they could earn versus risk - taking by doing so this becomes rather dry.

I'd consider this a good starter for 'lying' type of games but to me the replayability stops there.

Use the Merry Men expansion, it`s a must...

Base Sheriff of Nottingham is an OK bluffing game, but saying the truth is too overpowered. People could easily win the game just saying the truth, if you don`t believe it, try it, but with the Merry Men expansion, maaan it`s a different story. You must try lying, since you could get a really huge amounts of money for that. Forget the 6-9 gold worth contrabands from the base game, I`m talking about the ~30 gold worth black market cards, so people have to lie a few time just to stop people for getting them.

I'm so glad I pulled the trigger on this one. Every game is filled with laughter, bribery and back stabbing. Didn't think I'd like this style of game but I guess I was wrong. Now with Mr. Vasel hinting at an expansion, I can't wait for what to comes. Unique character powers? A 6th player? Even more Contraband? Who knows, but I'm excited

Another game, like Mysterium, that has fallen for me due to the same issue. If you have one person that doesn't get into the spirit of the game it will fall flat. Seriously people need to loosen up a bit when playing games. They're not meant to be taken seriously, they're fricken games

The component quality and artwork are great (although the Sheriff standee falls apart easily, though this is a minor quibble), it plays quick, and you can teach it in 90 seconds. This KILLED at my FLGS on Tabletop Day. Just a really, really fun game.

4p, 5p or 6p. A card game with bluffing, negotiations, hand management and set collection. Similar to Cockroach Poker. Video 52342 shows exciting gameplay, but it's not a full session. Videos 55054 and 56739 show full sessions with gameplay that seems repetitive.

Very good group game! Not for groups who don't like games that reward liars. Poker players will love this game. Yet, I'm not a poker player but I enjoy this game. En cada ronda hay un sheriff y otros jugadores quieren llevar la mercancía al mercado. Uno puede entrar mercancía legal o intentar colar algo ilegal. Si el sheriff decide inspeccionar tu mercancía y solo hay productos legales él debe pagarte una multa; pero si te descubre con productos ilegales tú debes pagar.

Was an enjoyable time with some laffos, but I don't think the game is actually all that... good. I'd play again, which is particularly noteworthy because I typically hate bluffing games.

RATING: 7
Looks like a pretty great bluffing/strategy game. Seems like it would really shine at 5 players (I've played with 3). I like it more than typical bluff/lie games because, while bluffing is a definite strategy, it's also not the only possible strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun market and good smuggling theme that completely offsets the negative aspects of bluffing being a mechanic in it, but even that is quite entertaining when roleplaying and is not an absolutely essential part of victory. Case in point, I'm horrible at it and I still won my first game by a huge margin.

I'm notoriously bad at lying, and even worse than that at bargaining, however this game is pretty good. If you're playing with a group of friends who have no mercy this game could probably turn ugly (and really fun), but we kind of went easy on the bargaining so we didn't get as much out of the game as we could have. Looking to change that next time!

After seeing this game featured on the youtube TableTop show, we knew it was the next game to add to our collection. 

It's very easy to pick up after watching the show, and relatively easy to teach, even to people who aren't familiar with more unique board games.

Most of the game components are decent quality. The cardboard market stands, sheriff, and coins are thick and durable, though when removing them from the packaging we had to be careful not to tear them.

We did have an issue with one of our market bags. It broke the day after we got it, because the snap was too strong for the fabric. However, I contacted the company and they responded within 24 hours and we had a brand new bag by the end of the week. Excellent customer service.

I would recommend this to pretty much anyone who enjoys a good game. It's easy to pick up, and the set time frame for the game also adds to it's appeal because you know you won't be stuck playing it forever.

I'll come right out and say it.  This is THE game to own.  Sheriff of Nottingham is an absolute hit whenever I bring it out with friends.  

What this game offers is the ability to truly manipulate your experiance.  Going from being a merchant telling the truth, or lying to the sheriff and getting caught, can certainly alter the outcome causing some players to be overly suspiscious of you, and others may be trusting of you.  This game is simply a great game because the GAMEPLAY is where it excels more than anything.  Which is the most important part of the game, the gameplay.

The only issue I could possibly think of with this game is that there is no true play mat, instead there are small mats for each person individually.  However, I can understand why this system was used in place one of large play mat.  

Overall, 9/10 two thumbs up.

I think the game has been ruined. The strategy of being the Sheriff and promising not to open the bag if you give 1 or 2 red cards is too good. If everybody does this as the Sheriff, then the game is no fun.  

Edit:  We now house rule the game where you can't offer the Sheriff goods in the bag and the game is fine.

This game is deception and deceit done right without having to take itself too seriously. I always enjoy popping this game out and introducing new people to it only for them to say at the end that they just bought the game online and plan to play it at home with their loved ones further increasing it's popularity. Now, what can I talk about Sheriff of Nottingham that hasn't already been said. From the calculating ways to trick the sheriff, the downright extortion the sheriff and players will do, and even the wonderful "SNAP" the poppers make, this game is loads of fun and is perfect for any board game night or get together. 

The only downside I have to say is the snappers on the bags. Plastic snappers don't snap easily as brass ones do. This causes the fabric to be tugged more harshly and could eventually lead to ripped bags trying to open those things. One alternative you can do is not snap the bags closed, but instead reach your hand in there pretending you are taking it out. However, if you pull the contents out it's like Popping the snapper open. 

Or, you can also contact Arcane Wonders if your bags have ripped and they will be so kind to replace them for you. Excellent game, excellent concept, and outstanding customer service. You can't go wrong with Sheriff of Nottingham from Arcane Wonders. It truly is deserving of the name Dice Tower Essential.

Some of the most fun I've had with a simple card game. I'm so terrible at being the sheriff that it's a joke. Excellent tension for both sides with every round. I like to keep a short timer on every round (about 2 minutes) to keep the action frantic and the back and forth negotiating going quickly.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2014)

I was keen on trying another game from Arcane Wonders. I really liked it, perhaps it can go up in my personal ratings. It is gorgeous, the art is great, the sheriff token is very well done (and big) and the cloth bags are also very high quality (although the snaps can get damaged rather quickly I surmise). The game is very easy to explain, but it is a blast to play with the right game group. I love negotiation and bluffing games. Lots of laughs on this one. Also lots of luck, but this is a party/family game so I don’t care much about that. 

When I read the rules, I thought this game was very similar to Hart an der Grenze and Robin Hood, but I haven’t played either so I don’t know if they are similar or not. 

For now I want to play again and I will probably buy it. Good fun.

Fun to snap the bags open.  Creates tense bluffing environment.

This is a good bluffing game and different than most of the others I have played in two main ways: When you bluff, it is immediately obvious (as soon as you store your cards). You can bluff all you want without consequence as long as you can convince others that it is in their best interest to not call you on it.

I have only played this once and would like to play again, but I am not stomping my feet to get it on the table with the gaming group(s). The main detraction for me and also for some others in my group is the scoring. Scoring is slow and arduous for such an otherwise light game. there is an app that can help, but it was not available when we played it. We will give it a try next time, but I expect it to only help some - you still have to count and log every card.

A bluffing/negotiation game.  I personally thought a dressed up bluffing/negociation game.  Initially I thought this game was fun, but I got bored very quickly.  I found negotiating who's goods to let through as the sheriff tiresome as I felt force to role-play and had to be willing to "play the game".  It really felt forced and not natural for me.  Chinatown is a far better negotiation game and there are other much better bluffing games. I'd rather play poker, liars dice or skull (skulls and roses).  All are better games.

Very group dependent as the game is in the player interaction. It needs players who are into bluffing, bribing and don't mind lying in a game. If players mostly play honest, don't trust anyone or simply cannot accept a bribe for not inspecting your bag when it's obvious by the amount of your bribe that your smuggling, play something else. Also, players need to haggle, threaten and talk shit for an enjoyable experience.

The cards of the first edition are of the weakest quality I have seen in a long time. The fake velvet bags are a fun component to play with although I wouldn't trust the button to withstand repeat plays. Better not close it at all in play.

I had fun with the game and would play again.  Some players in my group didn't feel to comfortable with the contraband and focused on the set collection aspect of the legal goods. Except me, nobody ever took contraband openly from the draw pile. I paid the highest bribes by far and in the end I probably had as much points from contraband as the other players together. Find out who is susceptive to bribes and use this opportunity for a joint profit. If there's nobody approachable at the table, forget it. Played as a mere set collection game it's a crapshoot of drawing the right cards.

This has turned in to my favorite game to play with non gamer friends and family. I really enjoy it. The promos are neat and I like that there are so many of them. Good thing I'm not a completionist freak.

RATING: 6
There are a few nitpicks I may have that don't necessarily hurt the game as a whole though which aids the idea that this one would benefit more by playing with the right group of people.

Bribing and side-deals NEED to happen otherwise it can get kind of stagnant - and sometimes the arbitrary nature of whether or not the Sheriff will open your bag can get frustrating.

Otherwise, this was a fun game that I'm sure will get pulled out to play fairly often (which might increase my initial rating a bit in the future).

This is my favorite bluffing game. It is essentially a gussied up version of BS, but it offers much more strategic decisions and a very strong theme. Your strategy also has to change to match the group of player-specifically the sheriff-which gives the game a very enjoyable meta.

I don't get to enjoy this game as often as I would like and, if you aren't careful, it will make you lose friends. Only play this game with thick-skinned people or really convincing liars.

Really fun filler game, and it has been a big hit every time we play it. The only complaint I have is that the snaps on the bags are way to tight. 2 of the bags were torn after only 3 or 4 plays. We just don't snap the bags anymore. Even with the cheap bags I couldn't rate this lower than a 9.

It was okay but it felt too long for what it is. Not to mention that there's no real incentive to ever lie because you get more points for having the majority of legal goods than having illegal goods sometimes. I think I need to play it again but if I want to play a bluffing game then I'll just play Cockroach Poker. It's much more accessible, much shorter, and just much more fun in general.

If everyone gets into the experience it can leads to lots of laughs.  This is one of the more enjoyable 'party game' options as far as I'm concerned.  It's a nice little package and we all like it when we get it to the table.  It feels like more of a game than the Werewolf/Resistance type of things.

Very fun bluffing game that becomes really tense sometimes. When you are the sheriff you look people in the eye and try to read them. If you don't get a good bribe you might threaten people and see their reactions. The concept is quite brilliant. There is also mindgames you can do by taking cards from the middle but they are minor since your hand size is not that big. I also like the contraband version of the legal goods so that you can never be sure if you are actually winning. My only complaint is that the bags get ripped after a while but Arcane Wonders is such a wonderful company they sent replacements for all the bags plus they sent some promos along with it. Love the game and company.

2016-04-10 - 6 - OK negotiation bluffing game. Very group dependant however. It's OK, I can play it from time to time, but it doesn't provide enough circumstances to shine on the silly dialogue level in comparison with Spyfall IMO. Although Spyfall requires much larger group. Good game for non-gamers too. 

2017-09-16 - 6->5 - I reconsidered my rating. I don't miss that game and prefer other that I rated with 6. I didn't like that you for quite a long time you lie about the same thing here as opposed to Spyfall mentioned before.

Maybe designate a scorekeeper if you know there are folks in your party who don't want to do their own sums in a board game!!

Killer bluffing game.  This game is 100% about how well you can bluff and negotiate.  Can you sneak illegal goods by the sheriff for a big payoff?  Would you rather be completely legal and clean in your trading?  Do you want to play suspicious to trick the sheriff into looking in your loot bag only to find legal goods and have to pay you a penalty for stopping and searching you?  Play it how you want.  Very fun game.  Obviously isn't for everyone, but this one is definitely for me.  :-)

We all know the story of Robin Hood, but what if we could help him out a bit and smuggle goods into Nottingham past the no-good sheriff?! Well you can in this game but are you as good a liar as you think you are? You must smuggle as many goods as you can into Nottingham past the sheriff, aaahh yes you can bribe the sneaky no-good sheriff BUT will he look the other way or even believe your lies?! 
Each player takes turns being the sheriff until all have been sheriff once! So which of you are a no-good liar that should never be trusted and which of you are the lie detector?

RATING: 6
I'm not a fan of bluffing games but this is probably the best one that I've played. Although it is possible to win by just doing set collection, that is missing most of the point of this game and isn't particularly fun. The big problem that I have with the game is that I don't feel particularly good when I deceive someone nor when I get deceived. I know it is just a game and all in fun but there you go. Personal hangups aside, it is kind of fun especially when people are roleplaying a bit. I don't mind playing it once in awhile but there are many, many games that I would rather play instead. This will stay in my collection for the time being though as my son and some of his friends love it.

Love the idea of this game on paper. Using deception, bluffing, mind games, and negotiation to win the game sounds awesome. A great theme and great artwork seem to make this game stand out. However, when actually playing, it usually  comes down to the most honest player winning, which goes against the whole idea of the game to me. The reward for smuggling contraband is not nearly enough, so in the end there is no real reason to. Table talk is the primary mechanic here, so if your group doesn't do well with role playing, this game will fall flat.

RATING: 7
A gateway game to more involved Bluffing/Negotiation Games.  I can't say that I was ever much a fan of bluffing games so that's probably why this game appeals even more to me.  It really is a beautiful production and the pouches work really well as a gimmick to conceal the cards yet also add a little thematic flair.  We've played mostly with 3 to date and it works just fine.  Our 8 year old son really loves the opportunity to "lie" and try to get away with stuff yet learn the lesson of what happens when you lie too much. 

I do like the way the set collection works here as well given the bonus for having the most of lower valued items is much higher than that for higher valued items by themselves.  The Royal Goods card are another nice addition to add just a little bit of variance and complexity.  It's a bit of a shame having to take all the bread out of the 3 player game as it reduces the variety in goods but I agree that this is what balances the 3 player game such that it plays the same as with the higher counts.

In our games thus far the negotiation element has failed slightly in that it almost always ends up as money being that which is offered and changes hands.  By the rules you can also offer up goods you already have, potential goods in your bag, or future favors.  It just hasn't yet seemed like any of those were much worthwhile though perhaps with more experience we will see the value in offering such over coin alone.

Not really excited about this game. I definitely prefer Poker (Texas Holdem).
Scores seem pretty random at the end.
This game feels a little too fiddly for what it is. There aren't a lot of rules, but since this is a very simple bluffing game, all of the rules on how many cards to take from which piles between turns just seem a little excessive. Also, shuffling this many cards is a bitch.

This is the quintessential "what you make of it" game. If no one lies, and no one bribes, then the game falls flat.

02-02-2015 - Not sure what I think.  Maybe I'm just not cunning enough to "get it".  I mean, the general idea is obvious, but... without writing a book I'm just not sure about the whole bribe thing.  It's like saying "my bag has bad stuff in it, please take this payment to let my bag through even though if you open it you'll take away points from me and I'll have to pay you anyway."  I know there's bluffing as well to get someone to THINK you have something bad in the bag, but I don't know.  7 for now.  It was fun, I did enjoy it, and I'd play again for sure.  I'm just not sure how truly "brilliant" it is despite the hype.

Sheriff of Nottingham is a pretty tough game.. fun... but tough. If you dont have a good poker face, this might not be the best game for you. If you have a refined sense of telling lies, you might do pretty well. Basically, youre a merchant selling goods, but some of the goods you are selling might be contraband. Your job is to convince the Sheriff of Nottingham that all your goods are legal, even if they are not. His job is to sniff out the liars. Its played over a series of 2 rounds where everyone is the sheriff twice and then the gold is counted at then end.

In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!

Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant? Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in? Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate? Declare your goods, negotiate deals, and be on the lookout for the Sheriff of Nottingham!

RATING: 8
Rating this game is [b][i]very[/i][/b] dependent on the group you can play it with. My rating is based on my personal experience and by playing it with the right group of backstabbing, lying maniacs.

Otherwise, I can objectively see people ranking it lower. If all players are equally getting into the game, it's brilliant. Just make sure that nobody ever takes things too seriously.

The artworks are really gorgeous, the component quality is great. The cards are arguably a bit thin in comparison to most other games, but that's understandable, considering the huge amount of cards and production costs. Players need to be a bit careful with handling the bags though, as a too quick and rough opening can tear the thin cloth.
The most disappointing thing for me is that the game "only" supports up to 5 players, while [b][thing=22237]►Hart an der Grenze[/thing][/b] (which is the version I played before) supported up to 6 players.

Nevertheless, this is critique on a high level. Great game, [i][b]if[/b][/i] played with the right group of players.

It's probably a good game of its kind for those who enjoy this kind so it won't get lower score than this from me. However I'm simply bad in this kind of game and I feel really uncomfortable playing it, therefore no desire replaying it. Also it feels longer and bigger than necessary with a theme that is forced on the cheating mechanism. If we must play a game where I tell you something and you have to decide if it's a lie or not probably Cockroach Poker is a way better option.

Absolutely enjoying this game. It's not a secret I gear towards bluffing and guessing games, and this one easily fits into my collection. What's great is that people uncomfortable with lying don't even have to lie if they don't want to - that's a very viable strategy that will still trip people up!

My only big gripe about the game is that the pouches can easily be ripped if not careful. So my first play night with the game we were extra careful... and yet the green pouch still ripped. :( I'm sad about it, but it doesn't break the game at least.

EDIT: Arcane Wonders' customer service is A+++. They already responded to my torn green pouch and are shipping a new one today. Great game, great company.

My game group loved this game. It is a lot of fun to play as you either lie or tell the truth to the sheriff. Everyone gets a turn at being the sheriff (twice) and the game ends with the person with the highest value of total goods in market winning. I liked it, didn't love it, but everyone put it to the top of our playlist

Ein sehr schönes Funspiel, bei dem es, zumindest mir, nicht ums Gewinnen geht. Man merkt auch deutlich, wer des Lügens nicht so fähig ist bzw. des Einschätzens der anderen Lügner ;).
In jeder Runde ist ein neuer Spieler der Sheriff und muss die anderen Spieler durchs Tor lassen und dabei ihre Waren kontrollieren. Die anderen Spieler stecken 1-5 ihrer 6 Handkarten in einen undurchsichtigen Beutel und schieben es dem Sheriff zu, wobei man die Anzahl und die Ware (nur eine einzige) deklarieren muss (Bsp.: ich habe hier 3 Äpfel). Dabei kann man dem Sheriff auch Bestechungsgelder, Waren und Versprechungen für zukünftige Runden anbieten. Öffnet der Sheriff den Beutel nicht, darf man alles darin behalten, egal ob dabei gelogen wurde oder nicht. Öffner er ihn allerdings, dann muss für jede falsch deklarierte Ware eine Strafe bezahlt werden (Schmuggelware dabei deutlich teurer, die darf auch nicht deklariert werden). Falls meine Angaben allerdings stimmten muss der Sheriff mir eine Strafe zahlen, da ich ja nicht gelogen habe...
Ein sehr schönes ich-denke-was-du-denkst Spiel... "Das sind 5 Äpfel" -> "Nie im Leben hast du 5 Äpfel" -> "Komm ich biete dir 3 Gold wenn du mich durchlässt" -> "Jetzt weiss ich dass dü lügst" *plopp+, der Beutel ist geöffnet und es kamen raus: 5 Äpfel... Strafe von 10 Gold! herrlich ;)
Mir gefällt das Spiel sehr gut, da man andere Spieler so hereinlegen kann, dabei sind mir Siegpunkte gar nicht so wichtig. Schön ist es wenn man einerseits die Wahrheit sagt und trotzdem Schmiergeld anbietet, wobei der Sheriff den Beutel öffnet. Eine Runde später beim gleichen Sheriff aber Schmuggelware von hohem Wert an ihm vorbeischmuggelt :)

Call it Robin Hood because Prohis has made a fool out of the Sheriff of Nottingham. I'm just going to defer to myself last year when I said:


Things that Prohis does better: 
- It takes out the overcomplication of various types of goods that are pretty much on there for theme by making each good one of three things: legal goods (worth $1k in your warehouse), illegal goods ($4k in your warehouse, -$4k in your hand), and inspectors (ranging value based on strength. 
- The challenge process is substantially better. When someone tries to ship to their warehouse, each player bids on whether or not they want to inspect that shipment. You start the game with an equal number of inspectors with 1, 2, or 3 stars. The player to bid their highest inspector inspects that shipment, flipping over as many cards as stars on their inspector. If they hit contraband, they take the entire shipment, adding it to their warehouse. If they don't, they have to give their inspector to the other player. You can also bribe someone not to inspect you or bluff by saying "go ahead". I like this process better because everyone participates in the challenge process, and you have more options.
- I like the scoring better. I think there's too much randomness in Sheriff of Nottingham that's eliminated in Prohis because a) you can choose to draw face up cards or take off of the pile and b) scoring is consistent across legal vs nonlegal goods.

It's much more fun if you have a silly group who really gets into the bribing/deceiving antics, and much less fun if you have a more subdued group focused on "min/max-ing" their chances of winning. This is definitely intended to be played with silly people taking silly chances.

RATING: 9
For pure outrageous fun, this is one of the best games I have ever played. Having played it with total strangers as well as friends, I can say that -- if played correctly* -- you are guaranteed to enjoy the experience. 

The components are well constructed, the game has a simple flow, and the bluffing and negotiation are boundless sources of cheer. 

For most audiences*, this is a must-have. LOVE IT!!


* It's important to note that the enjoyment of this game is in direct proportion to how much the participants are willing to let go, unwind, play it up (bad British accents, etc), and get a bit goofy. If you or your gaming group are stuffed shirts or introverts, your mileage may vary.

With the great group this is fantastic fun. What's in your bag? I may need to check it's contents. Fun bluffing, fun arbitrarily judging people to be lying or not... and ultimately seeing what was in the bags you let through!

Was dying to get this.  Finally got it Christmas 2014.  As of May 2015, still haven't played.  But it'll happen.

UPDATE (2015/09/08): Finally played twice (M&J, M&D&J) - great both times.  Definitely requires the players to get into the roleplaying or it could fall flat.  Really enjoyed, hope to play it more.

Can't get enough of this game! Takes the idea of social deduction and turns it sideways in a really competitive manner. It can create some really lasting memories when you offer four APPLES from your pouch to the Sheriff if s/he lets you slide for the turn.... and you have no APPLES!

RATING: 7
Normally not a huge fan of negotation and pure bluffing games, preferring the traitorgames for the same itch. But this one is very nice in it's simplicity but cool for the tons of ways you can play your hands and trade. Bribe the sheriff, give them cards which are good for them or just play fair and convince the sheriff to check you, very interesting. Best of all, negotiation and everything doesn't take ages, a simple click of the purse ends it.

RATING: 3
Boring game.  The best strategy is to simply tell the truth since you double dip if you are accused.  Not a well designed or tested game.  I don't understand the positive reviews this game receives considering just how shoddy it is.  Dice Tower essential is more of a marketing badge than any sort of quality as proven by this game.

Social deduction games are a crowded field. This is one of the worst. There is zero information with which to make any kind of decision. The rules on contraband scoring discourage any real bluffing. Winning through honesty is the best path. This is the opposite of what I want in a bluffing game.

My group always has fun with this game.  We become our characters and speak with accents.  And the snap the merchant bags make is oddly satisfying.  My one major gripe with this game is that they give you so many coins but you barely use them all.  Plus I worry that the merchant bags will rip someday.

But overall it's a very fun game that is easy to teach and play.  Highly recommended.

Played this at BGG con with a new group. There were 5 of us. It's definitely a fun game. Interestingly, I find that it's sort of difficult to bluff well in this one, even at 5 players. It seems like your best bet is to bid high (5 or more), if you can afford it, which forces the sheriff to potentially pay out big in order to search your bag. Low bids will (1-2) will most likely pass through, and medium bids (3-4) are the most likely to get checked. All in all, a solid game.

The only unfun part of this game is tallying the score. We've houseruled the game so it only goes around the table once with 4-5 players, and twice with 3. Makes it more of a filler, and now scoring doesn't take 15 minutes. If there's no value added in making a game longer, then why bother?

RATING: 6
What is touted as a bluffing game, Sheriff of nottingham realistically often becomes a game of bribing instead. The theme is great, but mechanically it breaks down into a very samey and boring game of bribery. Skip all the fluff and just get a streamlined bluffing game like Coup or Cockroach Poker.

FUN: bluffing and negotiation in almost the purest form without other distracting mechanics.

UNIQUE: the game forces people to negotiate, even if they would never do that in other negotiation games.

2nd best game of 2014.
Strictly speaking it's not a 2014 game, but I had only heard about the original game and not played it so.. Re-themeing and re-targeting for wider audience does miracles. Wonderful components and easy rules (scoring is bit complex, BUT you don't really have to worry about that until the game ends so it's not a big deal). This isn't a game about winning (you can break the game if everyone plays honest, but that's the case with all hidden role games really), it belongs to same genre of smart partygames as Cash n' Guns for example, but just happens to look more like 'normal' eurogame. Great mix of negotiation and bluffing. Just great!

*Haven't seen a variant for two yet but I'd think it's possible. Just play as 3p game but with two, only play two rounds maybe? Won't be fun for too long. Got to test it with my wife some day (very low priority though!). Should work in theory.

If your not too concerned about winning this game may be fun.  If you want to win it is very easy to just make trades and unfair with everyone but the person who is winning in order to get everyone back on the same level.  Games in which people can directly interact with each other are usually flawed in this way.

RATING: 6
Good 
This bluffing and hidden information encouraged by this game can occasionally result in humorous situations.

Bad
This game basically boils down to putting cards into a bag and handing them to the sheriff, who then randomly picks bags to open. If you happen to get lucky, or simply chose not to lie, then you are likely to win.

This game feels broken to me. The thematic idea behind the game is to sneakily send contraband into Nottingham along with some legal goods. However, I have played games in which a player never brings contraband into the city, and wins by a lot based on King/Queen points.

Another negotiation/bluffing game, Sheriff of Nottingham is great.

There is tension every round as you try to sneak in contraband into Nottingham. I also love that playing totally honest is a valid strategy.

I've seen people win both ways.

Unfortunately, as couples/friends/siblings sometimes like to collude with each other, this (as all negotiation games) falls apart easily. So choose this for the right group of people.

A light bluffing game about smuggling goods into Nottingham. What I like about this game is how it never requires you to lie, you can legitimately win by being honest the whole time. Players take turns being the Sheriff who may choose to inspect the goods of other players. Players may bribe the Sheriff to let them go or to inspect their bag or someone else's, if the Sheriff finds contraband it's confiscated and players have the pay a fine, if the Sheriff inspects a bag of legal goods they must pay the inspected player for the inconvenience. Whoever managed to accumulate the most wealth wins the game.

This game is ridiculously hilarious, a great bluffing game that will have you rolling in laughter. It's about sneaking your goods through the sheriff, and everyone gets the chance to be the sheriff, and if you get goods through him without him checking you're good, but if you try to sneak contraband through him and he checks you you're screwed. 

Really fun game of pushing your luck, bluffing and trying to get things through. He who dares wins, and wins laughing!

Sheriff of Nottingham is not for every group. The game lives a lot on the way the group interacts.

Also, the game gets better as the same group of people play with each other as the typical strategies of play become apparent and counter strategies can be devised.

This seems to be the type of game that needs a specific crowd of gamers with which to play.  I don't really have the luxury of having scads of gaming buddies to start segmenting my games into categories, plus it's far too light for my normal gaming group, so off it went.

RATING: 7.5
I rarely see people really get into the role play of this game the way some people have suggested, and it seems to me there's a fairly clear path to victory (or at least a requirement to have a shot at victory) which is to make sure your bag is always loaded, even if you take some fines you're just not going to win if you're only putting 2-3 cards through at a time.

That said - it's also a lot of fun and I've rarely seen it fail to be a crowd pleaser.  I think the Merry Men expansion will give it some more depth and likely increase my rating though I haven't dug into the that expansion enough for this review to reflect that.

A clever bluffing/negotiation game. All about playing to the current sheriff. Is this person going to think I'm lying? Are they going to think I think they'll think I'm lying? There's definitely an element of luck involved, but I think the negotiation mitigates that somewhat.

This game is a lot of fun, even more fun if everyone at the table has had a few drinks. Such a simple concept that can reward someone who plays underhanded with the contraband or someone completely honest.

Solid and fun party bluffing game which is accessible to pretty much anyone. However, you should not play this with a serious group or in a group which talks only a little. This game is much more fun if you know your opponents well.

The theme of this game is great and I think it offers many ways to try to reach the victory. Even though it is a party game, the bluffing element of this game offers a lot to strategize.

This is one of my favourite board games and I highly recommend it. It's strategic as well as very focused on bluffing, The aim of the game is to get as many legal and illegal goods into Nottingham. Illegal goods give more points if smuggled successfully but legal goods can give you great bonuses. Players take it in turns to be the Sherrif trying to catch out people smuggling illegal goods, the person at the end with the most points wins.

When played correctly, this is a really fun party-ish game. The only problem is, when you play for too many games in a row people tend to get spiteful, and they stop listening to bribe offers and just open the packs immediately. It hurts the spirit of the game. Play this once at the very beginning of your game night for best effect.

RATING: 7.5
Sheriff of Nottingham is one of those social games that lives or dies on the player's willingness to engage in creative story telling and spinning a yarn. 

Each round the player assuming the role of the Sheriff must decide if the other players are being truthful in declaring what they are transporting in their bags. If a player is caught lying or falsely accused then cash will change hands as a consequence. But players can also offer a bribe to have the Sheriff look the other way and the Sheriff can even demand a payment to look the other way. 

What the players are trying to do is to get as many goods of various types (including lucrative contraband) past the Sheriff as it will score points at the end of the game. 

This game is about bluff and double bluff, spinning humorous yarns and hand management. Throw in some majority scoring and a few drinks and Sheriff of Nottingham is a great game to have in the collection for the right group and social situations.

Nice little mechanic, with the right kind of group this would probably be a blast. Enjoyable. I like it more than most social-bluffing games, because it's not so heavy on crunching deduction; the bluffing here is more akin to poker.

What's not to like about this light hearted bluffing game? It's always dynamic and the various expansions and promos just add to the replayability.

This is a great game of bluffing and, depending on the other players, storytelling. It is definitely a fun game to get into character (and potentially a good tactic as well).

Pretty fun game. Plays in about a perfect time frame while having lots of opportunities to negotiate. If you can play with people who get into the spirit of the game, you're going to have a great time. Otherwise you won't, plain and simple. Only downside is the scoring at the end. I wish they could have included a score tracker or something so that you don't have to add so many numbers together. This one is very group dependent, as I think it can range from a 3 to an 8, for me, depending on who I play with. For my usual gaming partners, it rates a 5.

I usually like social deduction games, where you have to extract small clues and use them to convince the rest of the table. Sheriff of Nottingham has the tense balance between telling the truth (but make it seem like you're lying to get a compensation if checked) and bluffing (but make it seem like you're honest to get contraband past the sheriff). However, there are few clues given from the game but rather up to the players themselves to make up convincing stories. Also, the game in the game mainly takes places between the sheriff and only one other player, making the game less social. Players enjoying the role playing aspect may enjoy a game or two but I expect the replayability to be low.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprisingly blah.  The game can be really fun and funny, but I find that it's mostly just kind of boring.  Most of the time my group only tries to sneak contraband through once or twice a game, so the sheriff just keeps getting burned over and over again by opening bags.  If the sheriff tries to take their time questioning people, the game bogs down (EDIT: the app helps a lot with timing the sheriff, as well as helping with the tedious scoring!).

Great idea, just not as fun as I was hoping.  A hit with my group, however.

EDIT: Upgraded my rating based off some info I read here at BGG.  It basically said that as a bluffing game, Sheriff is pretty crappy.  As a NEGOTIATION game, however, it shines.  If you play to what the Sheriff is collecting (you see that he has a lot of apples, so you slip a few in your bag and offer him the choice of a card if he lets you through), the game becomes a LOT more fun and the amount of contraband trying to be brought in skyrockets, making all aspects of the game better.

RATING: 6
Bluffing game with great art and components. Unfortunately I do not fully see the enjoyment of this game. I may need to dive a bit deeper. So far it seems to be about figuring out who you can pay off to let you do whatever and justing waiting to smuggle everything in then. Though that has never won me the game. More research is needed.

Yes, it's a bluffing/negotiation game, it's group dependent and you might like it more than I do, yada yada yada. The best thing I can say about Sheriff of Nottingham is that I would normally rate this game lower, but it has its moments. However, three problems:

- The amount of information you have to keep track of to be able to make semi-educated calls on any pouch's content is substantial. I do not rate the memory part of games highly, especially when the core gameplay decision wholly relies on it.
- Since any fine may set you back enough to be single-handedly game-losing, the game discourages boldness from both sheriff and merchants, which means that the least flamboyant half of your group will probably play a very uneventful and low involvement game.
- For how casual player friendly the core gameplay is, the lengthy maths operation we get in place of a readable scoring system seems completely inappropriate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In theory I love this game, but I can't get past the fact it seems to be more profitable to always tell the truth and make your living as an honest merchant, than to embrace the game's smuggling mechanic. I've only managed to play once or twice so far, so it could have just been my brief experience though. The high-risk high-reward method of smuggling sometimes pays off, but often you end up losing a huge amount more, whereas the slow and steady 'honesty policy' seems to be a far more effective way to victory. That said, it's great fun trying to deceive whoever is playing the sheriff, so maybe the secret is to just not worry too much about winning!

Even watching this game is entertaining, featured on Tabletop I instantly bought it and when it arrived it did not disappoint. Note, your experience may vary as it is a social game that requires people to actually play in the spirit of the game.

Had a problem with one of the bags and emailed the support, they responded so fast and even sent some promos when they sent the game. I went out of my way to buy some additional products from them for their generosity.

This game is quick and light, that is fun for the whole family. One of my games that is asked for to play with on a frequent basis.

Since my friends have it we will pass on it to play their copy, but it is definitely a good time.  It is important to get into the theme.  If you sit quietly you will lose a lot of its appeal.

Considering getting this given the new expansion announced. If it 

- decreases the King/Queen bonus
- adds extra incentives for smuggling
- adds a 6P
- does not greatly increase playtime
- fits in the base game box easily

I will probably get SoN and its expansion in the future, unless a better bluffing game comes out over this by 2016.

Okay nvm. I dont like how you need house rules to make smuggling contraband more lucrative. And I dislike reliance on shuffling thoroughly with card draws to make the game well balanced and fair for the card draws. These two are huge and make the game not as exciting as its potential could be.

An improvement in my eyes is give everyone same 10 cards, 5 contraband and five legit goods then smuggle five through then track with tokens on an item track and just reuse 10 cards. This allows players not to have to rely on card draws as much. But it needs much tweaking
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A promising idea, and initially very fun, but with diminishing returns as players become familiar with the game. Strategy tends to fall by the wayside when players realize that staring down the sheriff to see who blinks first tends to offer higher returns than bribing. When players refuse to bribe, the sheriff is forced to be completely arbitrary, and the main mechanic of the game falls apart.

Currently my favorite bluffing/negotiation game and will probably remain so for quite some time.  This game always goes over well with my gaming group. Great production value.  My only minor complaint is that the bag snaps don't always want to release.  Sometimes it feels as though the bag will rip before the snap comes undone.

This is a wonderful game but by no means a perfect game.  There are probably ways it could be better sometimes it seems there isn't enough reason to run contraband as it seems the most honest player wins too often.  But the fun in the game lies in figuring out just how to get the sheriff to open your back when you're not sneaking anything through. Also the little bags and that snap that it makes when it's opened is incredibly satisfying.  It's just a fun game.  I hope they do some expansions that could add some diversity and perhaps give more incentive to running contraband.

Pretty great (had an absolute blast in a five-player game with my non-gamer sister's family) but not one that I plan on pulling out very often.  It's a unique experience - and everything is well done - but I'm concerned about its lasting appeal if played too frequently.  Plays long - overstays its welcome a bit.

It's a modernized Bullshit for the euro era, a crowd-pleaser, but not something I especially like. In fact, I'd rather play any of the games in any the genres it touches (Liar's Dice, Resistance, King's Breakfast, Nottingham). Destined to hit the table frequently anyway.

RATING: 6.8
The cards and the art are very nice, as the rest of the components are, except for the player bags; their buttons don’t last long. They are not necessary for the game, but they created an anxious feeling whenever you heard the click of the button when the Sheriff was about to open your bad and find illegal merchandise...

The rules are very simple: it’s a game about bluffing and trying to guess your opponents’ bluffs. For me, it provides an experience very similar to [thing=45]Liar's Dice[/thing], but it’s been upgraded components and most important, a theme that can inspire players to represent their roles and negotiate bribes. It’s one of those games that really depends on the players to provide the fun.

There’s a couple of things I didn’t like:
· I think it’s too long. It’s too much time doing the same thing. It’s not a big deal, though, because you can just stop after the first round and cut the duration in half.
· Why majorities are scored at the end? I think it serves no purpose, it just adds more uncontrolled randomness and unnecessary complexity.

It’s not a game I would like to play constantly, but it can be fun occasionally, when the players are right. And on top of it, you can also play it with your family or other non gamers, provided they are up for the challenge.

Decisamente non nelle mie corde, un gioco ripetitivo, banale, per nulla strategico e a mio avviso poco interessante. Simpatica la componente di bluff ma non basta per un gioco che a mio avviso non ha mordente, anche se al momento pare aver conquistati gli utenti di BGG. Nel gioco ci si alterna nei panni dello Scheriffo di Nottingham per controllare il contrabbando di prodotti all'interno delle proprie terre. Il più delle volte gli accordi vengono risolti con il pagamento sottobanco di tangenti. Spunto interessante che vanifica, a mio avviso, dopo poco tempo.

What I enjoy about it, is that you can chose how honest or not you want to be and you can switch it up during the game. 
Games like Resistance (which I also enjoy) usually stress me out when I'm a bad guy, because I know I'm gonna have to lie and keep it up at least mostly throughout the game, but in Sheriff it's a bit more relaxing, because you can decide when you are ready for it.

I think I would like this game more with a somewhat drunk, somewhat rowdy crowd. People that like bluffing and acting for their own pure enjoyment. But I haven't really done that yet, even owning the game I've only put it on the table twice. I would love to give it a couple more gos and perhaps up the rating.

Update: played a couple more times and this game can definitely be fun and interesting.

I am not a good liar and playing with people who can always tell if I trie to lie and are able to smuggle in contrabants all the time, makes the game really hard. But this does not diminish the fun I had and have playing the game, since it is always possible to adapt the strategy of playing to ones own abilities and still win. Really cool game!

RATING: 9.5
One of the best 5-player games ever. Perfect for any skill level of gamers and always livens up game days. The optimum strategy is to never lie and carry the most "allowed" goods but I like that the game almost forces you to change your strategy in every turn. The gameplay is short, sweet and easy to make decisions. The artwork is fantastic and fits with the theme. While the components could use a little help (the cards could be built of sturdier stock, the coins fall apart, and the bags tear where the snap is), Sheriff of Nottingham is a wonderful game to bring everyone back to life after a day of gaming or to show people new to gaming. One of the best bluffing games out now.

It's kinda fun trying to trick the sheriff into making the wrong call (on whether to believe what you've said is in your packet or not) the first time, and maybe a few times after that. But the game loses its pall by the time you do it the 10th time. There's only so many variations on deals to let something through, or tricking someone into calling you when you played it straight. It's not a bluffing game, it's a tricking game cum guessing game. And that's a mechanic that's fine in a 15 min game but it just doesn't hold up too well over a longish 60+ min game.

Sheriff of Nottingham is a set-collection game that revolves around negotiation, often in bad faith.  Basically, players rotate taking the role of the sheriff, and other players must declare what they're taking into the village (truthfully or not).  The sheriff has the opportunity to inspect one player's lot, and can take bribes from players to help influence his decision.  Personally, lying and extortion are not at all fun for me, so I didn't enjoy this one.

This is an excellent party game. I highly recommend playing this with a bit of light (to medium) roleplaying. Get into character and try and bluff your way to victory.

This game actually requires a lot of skill. You need to be conniving and ruthless. You need to establish yourself as an honest merchant, then ruthlessly take advantage of everyone's trust. If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a cop conducting an interrogation, this is the game for you. You need to read everyone's facial expressions and body language, and determine if they're lying or not.

I finally got to play this at my local meetup today.

I had this game under my radar and wishlist for a while but finally scratched it feeling it won't fit my game group (parents and siblings) much since they didn't take it too well with The Resistances Avalon.

I turned out to be right. I can see this game fun with the right group (which thankfully the meetup people are all humorous and good spots and didn't take anything personally). I can see this game doesn't have the legs and won't fit my family too well.

I'm glad that I had a chance to give it a go.

Something about the cheese and the apples just appeal to me. Maybe it's the fantasy setting. Or the art style. It's the way you craft your web of lies when talking to the Sheriff. Contraband or no, it's always fun watching perplexed Sheriffs decide your fate. 

And those bags. Good bags. The feel of the bags, it just oozes with theme. I feel very much like a merchant passing customs, and it's a very good feeling escaping with contraband in hand.

Light bluffing card game. Looks great, but I feel it could have done with a fraction of the cards and coins provided with the game.

The rules are functional and enable an entertaining game, but in a game like this how much fun it is depends entirely on the group, and you should decide for yourselves what you do and do not allow.

Not really my cup of tea, but sometimes I like a Pu Erh instead of a Keemun Congou, and if I have to play a bluffing game, this would be a choice I can get behind.

The other players try and bring 4 different items to market (and try to slip contraband in sometimes as well.)  Shipments are sealed in a bag and you can attempt to bribe the sheriff to let shipments pass or have him inspect opponents shipments.

Requires good group dynamic and a believable poker face.

RATING: 8
Well liked by my group, and I enjoyed it too.  We like to lie to each other and hurt each other's feelings whenever we get the chance, and since I can't convince them to sit through a three hour game of BSG, this is a nice substitute.  Wish it was six players, as that would push it into "perfect party game" territory, but understand the need to keep costs manageable.  The art is cool, but the pouches feel a little flimsy, particularly the clasps.  Doubt it will survive beyond a few plays.  But, fortunately, I have lots of other games to play.  So, SoN will likely just be a nice "every once in a while" kind of thing instead of a "must play weekly game."

Sheriff of Nottingham: TableTop S03E07
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG0zfMslfQs&list=WL&index=39
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A bluffing game in which the players each take a turn being the Sheriff of Nottingham. The object of the game is to gain the most gold (VP) at the end of the game. In order to do that, you must get your items to the Market by passing them through the Sheriff without inspection. Some items are legal, while some are illegal contraband. Lying, bribery, deal making are all essential part of this game. This is a great fun game to play with friends. Highly recommended. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun and flexible bluffing/bribing game. I like how many ways you can approach it: You can take the moderate honest reward or try for a higher, riskier reward. You can try to fool the sheriff into allowing your contraband through or you can straight-up bribe them to let it through. You can bribe the sheriff to not let someone else's shipment through if you think they're far in the lead.

Being the sheriff is a lot of fun too. It's a fun position of power where everyone's fates depend on your decisions for that round, and it can be fun to roleplay it and try to extort your friends.

The only real thing I don't like about it is how long it takes to play. At heart, it's a simple bluffing game with a fair amount of luck thrown in, and that type of game works best for me if it ends quickly so I don't feel annoyed by getting badly hurt from bad luck.

Always a fun time, this game plays well with 3-5 and doesn't take too long. Easy to get almost anyone to play, even non-gamers. My minor complaints mostly stem around the fact that winning this game often depends on a bit of luck and that some of the gameplay relies on players who are actually willing to enter into negotiations/bribing a bit instead of simply deciding to check someone's bag and instantly opening it. Still I pretty much always have fun playing this and am pretty much always willing to play it.

RATING: N/A
People complain that there's a degenerate strategy in this one (always tell the truth), then they blame the player(s) pursuing that strategy as "not playing the game." I don't buy it, and I think if you've designed a bluffing game where bluffing is a bad idea, then you're not quite done tweaking the game. 

Kakerlakenpoker is way, way, way better than this. SoN's truth-telling problem is sort of encouraged by the fact that there's one winner. Kakerlakenpoker dispenses with that and instead makes one [i]loser[/i], the rest winners. So SoN's problem is that the stated winning condition incentivizes players to do the very thing that makes the game unfun. This is not the players' fault at all. 

Ultimately, though, this is a simple set collection game turned into a much longer game for no real reason. Kakerlakenpoker is smaller, cheaper, faster to play, easier to explain, and doesn't suffer from a degenerate strategy. If all you're doing is collecting sets of things to then run through a triangular scoring table, why put up with much bother?

RATING: 2
Some people love this game and based on the ratings and reviews, I'm clearly in the minority.

Originally thought I didn't like this game because it was a bluffing games. This is not the case. I like Mafia, One Night, and Secret Hitler. So, I have no issue with bluffing games.

The reason this game is bad is two fold. First, no matter what, it's really just a guessing game. You don't accumulate knowledge throughout the game and work logic to see who is bluffing. Every round is new info. This makes it a random guess each round. The second issue is that the easiest way to win is to just not bluff. The penalty for bluffing is harsh and the penalty on the sheriff for calling out a non bluff is also harsh. There's no benefit to bluffing.

The game is not good and the hype is lost on me. My only guess is that sales are boosted by an excellent tabletop episode.

RATING: 8
A fun game that adds a little extra to Resistance. It's a lot of fun to try and trick the Sheriff into searching your bag when you have legal goods and then doing the same thing next turn as you sneak in some illegal goods. It is a fun party game and pretty easy to teach any level of player. My only gripe with the game is after a few play throughs I felt like I had seen it all. Still a lot of fun though.

Sheriff is essentially the board game evolution of the traditional card game "Bullshit"/"Cheat".

It's a wonderful way to spend an hour or so lying to your friends without the stress, hostility, or complication of games like Werewolf or Resistance.

I almost always hate bluffing games (the only possible exception being ONUW) and would love to not play this again. At least it has the the set collection. If it had a few more mechanics so that bluffing was less of an issue I may have enjoyed it more but I am not the target audience anyway.

It has bluffing, it has set collection - should be the perfect party game. Hasn’t really turned out that way in my two games. Too long, bit too repetitive and the bluffing isn’t intelligent enough.

Just some merchants smuggling contraband under the nose of occasionally gullible sheriffs. It's one of those games that is great when you're in the mood for it.

Sheriff of Nottingham is fantastic.  It drew a crowd of spectators when I played it at my game club for the first time.  We had a blast, getting into the role-playing, bluffing, bribing and backstabbing!

What REALLY blew my mind though is this is the first game that my wife, son and I truly love! In my collection of close to 400 games, probably about 100 of them are family games, or games I bought with my family in mind.  Out of all of those games, there are quite a few that two out of the three of us love, but the third doesn't like it or think's it's just okay. There are some that only one of us love and the other two think it's just okay.  There are some that we all agree are kind of meh.  I was beginning to think I would never find a game that my wife, son and I all love to play.  Well, thanks to Arcane Wonders, I've finally found it!

Played this with 10 people (pairs working very well and thematically it makes also sense). Also i added the 6 player to it with paper and Pen, even before the dice tower announced it as an expansion (where is my apple tom? ;) ).

I like this game. It takes this simple situation where you are stopped for a check of your goods (anyone who travels knows this for sure) into a poker game where you try to get away with the most outcome.

still i would not play it twice in a row because i can take its while to play it.

I've wanted Robin Hood and Hart en der Garze for so long that when Nottingham was announced it was a must buy. So far, it has met my expectations. Definitely a light game that focuses almost entirely on bluffing, but has enough charm to keep me coming back for more. The promo contraband cards add a lot of flavor. Overall, a very satisfying experience which lends itself to some downright entertaining moments. I hope to see more support for the game in the future. No more re-implementations!

I thought this would be a big hit, but it turn out I hate it and want to sell it after my turn end.

noone in my group is doing any negotiation, just open or not based on their guess and face reading. and also that's make the "always-legal" guy.

The panalty system is somewhat weird, the sheriff always feel disadvantage when opening bag. 

and the bag is sooo hard to pop open, my group decide not to snap it back after the first time.

in the end, the card counting and finding who is the king/queen is very tedious. 

overall, maybe isn't not bad but not work with my group. and I know that I don't really negotiation game. 

reason to sell: very sad about this game, better buy something els.

I have fond memories of this one, as it is one of the earliest titles I have that have been enjoyed by many a friend and family member. Namely, it is the means by which this game allows you to straight-faced LIE to your friends and family that gives it such novelty. However, a recent play revealed to me that this game wasn't all that it was once cracked up to be, or that my tastes in gaming have changed. It is likely the latter. I would in almost all scenarios play something less fiddly, less reliant on gimmicks, and more streamlined if I were to choose a bluffing game. Oh, say, Liar's Dice. Sheriff of Nottingham will still find a place in many a family/friend group--it's just that when Liar's Dice is just as accessible and all-the-more skill-related, why would I choose otherwise?

I always love bluffing games and this is no exception. Really simple, but I've always had a great time playing it. Update 8/2016: Maybe it has just lost it's luster, but I have found that my enjoyment of the game has decreased to the point where I don't always bring it because I don't want someone to pick it as the game we play. I still have fun with it from time to time, but I really have to be in the mood for it and when I'm not it is almost tedious to play.

This game is really average.  I never felt challenged in any way -not that its necessarily the point of the game to give you any feeling of depth.  Your choices really feel limited, and winning/losing the game always seemed arbitrary and without satisfaction/dissatisfaction.  Also, the components are terrible; my copy came with ink blotches and I had to use an exacto knife to properly remove most pieces from the punch-board.  This was my first, and will probably be my last, game bought from publisher Arcane Wonders.

I had high expectations from good recommendations, and I usually like bluffing games with imperfect hard evidence.  I was underwhelmed with the 3 player game, but I think it will probably be better with more.

The cards removed for 3 player games remove variety from the deck, changing the distribution from larger games.  It becomes more viable to draw a hand of 4-5 legitimate goods, making the game less about lying and more about just rummy-style draws.  That in turn makes inspections less about reading people and more about luck.  Overall, the game was flat.

I still have high hopes it will be better with more players and the full deck.  In fact, I see no reason why the full deck can't (and shouldn't) be used for 3 player games.

update:  with 5 players, the lying is much more fun, but the scoring is a bit less satisfying and arbitrary,  A net gain for a game that is all about lying.

In essence a bluffing game with negotiations. Great game to bring out unless people in your group hate bluffing. I like the whimsical theme and artwork that draws people into the game and facilitates some flavour role-playing. The special pouches with snap buttons are also facilitate the tension and fun. The phone app makes scoring fast and easy. Rule book was insufficiently clear, and expect to take some time to explain Phase 1 and 4.

What I liked:
-Great theme and artwork
-Good components
-Flexible and open negotiations
-Exciting tension and suspense
-Good phone app for scoring

What I disliked:
-Rulebook does not cover negotiations properly
-Rulebook does not cover market phase properly
-Balance appears to favour passive honesty and not checking bags

I love this game, and so does my son.  The mechanics are simple, and there are strategy and decisions that can make a big impact, but the social aspect of this game is where it really shines.  In a fun group we're speaking with voices and accents, passing insults and compliments around, bribing in all sorts of ways, etc.  It gets down right hilarious at times.  On the other hand, if you get a couple of players that just aren't into it, then it loses a lot of it's charm.

19-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. One of Tom Vasel's favorite games. Did I like it? Yeah. I did. But why?

First off, you are a merchant trying to make the most money in Nottingham. How do you do this? You of course get in trade goods. Legal ones are no problem, but those illegal goods might make it worthwhile..

In the game, you collect a hand of cards. You can discard up to five to draw new cards. The cards you discard are open, as potentially the cards you draw. You can draw from open discard piles or from the top of a deck. Then you put cards in a bag, these goods can be legal (green) or illegal (red bordered). 

You CAN lie about what is in your bag, but not about the number of cards you put in. If the sheriff opens your bag, you have to pay fines if you tried to snuck in illegal goods. If you didn't, the sheriff needs to pay you for his transgressions and corruption.

The game is fun, but highly group dependent. So make sure that the group you play with likes roleplaying/backstabbing/cheating. If you play with the wrong group this game breaks down. I am not so impressed about the components. The cards and art is good, but the cardboard tokens / boards are a little less than I have come to expect with tearing tokens and misprinted/ uncentered boards.

Pretty good bluffing game, but a bit too long for what it is. I prefer Coup for fast straight bluffing or a real negotiation game where you are uncertain of how much something is worth to a player but you're not trying to trick players. But I think for someone that really like giving false tells and Poker, this would be a great one to try.

Repetitive. I wanted to like it, but there wasn't enough to it. It's like one of those pop tunes with a catchy beat but only one line repeated over and over. (Put cards in sack and bluff/tell the truth. Repeat.)

It is obviously a lot of other people's cup of tea. More a party game that doesn't play a whole party of people, but only four.

I'm not sure why there was so much fuss about this when it came out. It's a decent enough game of lying to people and trying to guess who's lying to you, but the pace is a bit slow and if you don't have players getting into character as the sheriff, it all becomes a bit dry. The "aha, I'm going to inspect your bag, you scruffy peasant!" stuff always feels quite forced, as though everyone is desperate to cover up the fact that the game is quite dry and a bit lifeless. Not awful by any means - it's a pleasant enough play - but doesn't deserve its reputation.

Really wanted to like this thing. Honestly, I don't think it's that bad a game; I think it's just a bit overrated. The rule that you can only say you have one type of item confused my grandmother, and to a lesser extent the other players, who seemed to otherwise get the game. Mind you, it's not a bad game. It's good to play if you're playing with the right people. The rest of the family were new gamers, and they seemed to get it pretty easily. Fairly easy to teach, although the rule about how you can only say you have one type of good will confuse many younger and older players (rightfully so, in my opinion). Maybe a bit too many fiddly rules for very young children. You can of course play with house rules, which is probably the best thing to do.

New to the game, but it's a lot of fun! After including a dozen different players of various interests, there hasn't been one person who played it and didn't thoroughly enjoy it.

I have only played this game once so far, but am looking forward to future plays. It was just the right level of complexity for our group (it may be a bit too complex for a social game night with all non-gamers, as the rules did take a bit of time to get through, but it was just the right complexity level for our group of "moderate gamers"). 

To be honest, this is the type of game I would have probably walked right past at a store (we received it as a gift), assuming it to be a bit too rule-heavy and fantasy-oriented in nature for our typical crowd, but the core gameplay is actually quite straightforward once you get through the basic rules.

Pros:
-Nice mix of bluffing / strategy / luck. I found that framing the game in the context of the familiar BS / Cheat card game made its general concept more immediately accessible to the group.
-High quality game, everything feels really sturdy
-You can customize the cards in the deck to suit your needs (e.g. reducing to a 3 person game, upping the challenge by putting in the Royal Goods cards, etc.)
-It seemed like there were additional ways we could strategize as we got more familiar with the game, which makes me think that we will continue to find good replay value with this game.
-The "king of X" bonuses as the end added another level of strategy to the game (sort of like the "longest route" bonus in Ticket to Ride)

Cons:
-To echo what others have said, I can see how the game may not incentivize aggressive bluffing enough. One person in our group who played a completely honest game ended up coming in as a very close second. I like the idea of adding in the Royal Goods as a way to potentially address this challenge.
-May be a bit off-putting to non-gamers at first, but hopefully a quick run-through of the basic premise will make it clear that the game is actually not so complicated after all.
-This is a small nuance, but we found the card tray to be annoying, as it made it difficult to dig under the top card on the discard pile to see what was underneath. We quickly remedied this by just putting the card piles directly on the table.
-We'd like to see some more examples of the bribing element in live play, to get a better sense off how this can play out effectively - we used bribing to some extent, but it felt like we left some of the potential untapped here (there wasn't a lot of back-and-forth negotiation in our group).

Overall, this seems like a gem of a game, and I'm surprised that it took us this long to find out about it!

This is another game that seems to be FAR too long for what it offers.  In general the mechanics are alright, but it feels a bit dated. 

I also agree with many who say that in general the optimal strategy is "hope you get good cards in the draw and play legal goods."  Add in maybe 1 lie and you are golden.  I might enjoy it a bit better if the sheriff could only open 1 bag per turn, making it much more enticing to send in illegal goods, but i imagine this would have large balance effects. As such, this will go in the "probably not playing this again" pile of games.

My time for light gaming is better spent elsewhere.

Ditches the tin suitcases of Hart an der Grenze and adopts the little pouches that came with Robin Hood. It's the third or fourth incarnation of the 1950 game Contraband, with all new artwork, but it plays pretty much the same. Barely rates a new entry here on BGG.

Takes the whimsical border smuggling of Hart an der Grenze and gives it a spin in Sherwood Forest tying to smuggle your wares past the Sheriff of Nottingham. 

A few deals are struck, lots of risk taking, bluffing and guessing and not much else. Repeat the same thing over several rounds and you end up with a winner.

It's okay, but not a game I feel the inclination to keep bringing to the table. More of a social experience with disbelief at what players will try and get past you with an innocent look on their faces. Worth a laugh, but there's better laughs out there.

A fantastic game of lying to someone's face. How this is played is almost entirely up to the group playing it, and how much fun had also.

A very clever bluffing game that is fractionally too dependent upon card drawing to be ideal - the market mechanism is almost enough to balance that though.
The length is nigh-on perfect though; it's long enough that history starts to matter, but not so long that history gets in the way.  That's a good trick that most similar bluffing game (like e.g. Coup) don't quite manage.

This is an intense game of bluffing with numerous possibilities for optimizing profits. Getting people to think you've lied when you haven't, paying off the sheriff to open someone else's bag instead of your own; there are so many ways to play this game.

My only complaint with Sheriff of Nottingham is that, most of the time, crime doesn't seem to pay. I find myself winning most often by being an honest merchant, and that's honestly not a lot of fun. I think that either the bonuses should be reduced or contraband should be worth a lot more.

RATING: 8.5
I've played Sherriff three times at this time, and every time has been good, uproarious fun. Admittedly, much of the fun is gleaned by how "dirty" the players are playing (honest players will almost certainly fail in this game) as well as how much they're roleplaying. I'd recommend that the group's ambassador compels the group to do funny voices, and play as funny characters to spice things up and encourage sleazier dealings... The screams of my group as I put 4 items into my contraband pile after only bribing the sheriff $7 is pretty priceless.

SPOILERS for some basic strategy: Basically, your goal in this game is to get as many items to market as possible, legal or otherwise. A smart player should be open-handed (to a point) with bribes. I mention this in the review because it's important to point out to new players that playing honestly will not be a winning strategy.

A tough one to rate.  Have played it a few times now:  sometimes it hits and everyone has a great time, sometimes it flops and is fairly dull.  I have a feeling I should get rid of this and invest in a simpler bluffing game, like Skull & Roses.

RATING: 7
A simple bluffing game which is good for a rowdy gaming group. Not to be taken too seriously as the game design means this is supposed to be a social game. Is he bluffing or not? No one wants to get the answer wrong to that question and everyone should laugh when it is revealed how wrong you were in that answer.

Just picked this game up before our last game night and brought it hoping to get some folks to play. We played one game with 5 people and had a blast. We even started speaking in accents and owning the role of the sheriff. Everyone was laughing and by the end there were some ridiculous bribes going down. Fun game that is light enough for newbies but still engaging for veterans.

With the right group this is an exceedingly fun bluffing game repleat with humorous roleplaying and friendly backstabbing. We upgraded the included cardboard currency with two sets of beautiful, theme-appropriate metal coins from Feif ($60, Academy Games https://academygames.com/games/product/cid-137
This really adds realism to the extortion & bribery mechanisms when attempting to get your contraband through, plus we use these heavy weight coins to score each players market once the game is over since no score pad is included with the game. I highly recommend this game unless your group doesn't enjoy deceitful games, direct player interaction or is uncomfortable at role playing.

It's a smuggling game - you're merchants bringing stuff across the border (or in this version into a city), declaring what's in your bag and having trouble if the inspection finds anything you didn't claim to be there. However the inspector (sheriff) has a problem, if they open a bag and everything is legal. You can bribe the sheriff offering them money, delivered goods, potential goods (ha!) - to not check your bag, or maybe somebody else's, or whatever you wish. The trick is that any deal made for the current round is binding. This lays down the framework for a player driven hilarious game about bluffing and negotiating (kinda sorta). And as with best games of this type the groupthink grows with the game and the group. Anybody claiming to find "optimal strategies" is just formulating their groupthink that can be countered. You just need to reach that equilibrium where you're not sure if a certain move is honest, a bluff, a counter-bluff or a counter-counter-bluff. Light roleplaying helps, I mean, it's an excuse to do stupid things before other player's noses. 

I'll try to get over the hideous front cover art, will see if I'll manage. Oh and the theme is pretty pedestrian as well.

I have only played this once. As was the case with Tokaido, I knew quickly that I wanted a copy.It is basically another variation of a bluffing card game. If you can't lie don't play this. Otherwise, play it. It is great fun especially with people you have just met.

Played twice with 5P. Sheriff of Nottingham is a rather clever negotiation game with the opportunity to go, as gamers like to say, to full metagame-mode. 

My two main concerns is that it tends to get a little mathy in optimising bribes, which in turn leads to games running a little long. Overall quite an impressive game, but I would probably be more impressed if I hadn't played the quicker and more compact [thing=165563][/thing] earlier.

I don't know WHY I love bluffing games so much considering my win loss ratio is like 12 - 575. This is a great game. Lovely mechanic and art and ooh boy does my step son and I love to bluff and get destroyed in that game.

First game: the 7 year old (fairy girl) tells us she's NEVER going to Lie.. so I think. "the she's never going to win". She went through the WHOLE game only "fibbing" once at the very end... She too second. I took. DEAD LAST.

Bluffing game of trying to smuggle goods into the market.  Some interesting thing going on with majority scoring etc.  but the bluffing and negotiating is the heart of this game.  I think length is the problem with this one.. specially when people starts to negotiate heavily..  Shame because I like the negotiation and bluffing game and I like some aspect of this one.  Will play it again but rating will most likely go down.  Also needs right group of people.

I like the fact that you can choose to either lie your pants off or tell the truth for the entire game. This allows for people who don't like lying to enjoy the game and not feel pressured to do so.

Bluffing is fun! But the boring euro-game framework and bean counting is not.

Also, I think the game breaks down with collusion and VERY hard to calculate (but still possible and unfun) FFA scenarios.

Losing players often have no choice but to kingmake to try and crawl back the "running"

As an activity it's a good time, but it's a fairly rubbish game. Scoring's too complicated for this type of game, it's really difficult to know the standing before the end, and it's anti-climatic to count everything up. Needs the right group more than most party games or it can become a bore. You have to bring a lot to the game to make it fun. Felt bags, with the loud popper openers are brilliant though.

Enjoyable bluffing game that maybe takes a little too long for what it is. I wish there was just a LITTLE more meat to it for how long it plays (or that it was shorter).

As far as I can tell, this game is about identifying tells.  To a lesser extent, it's probably about card counting and guessing what you're opponent is likely to do.  I don't really care for any of these things, but I also don't hate any of these things either.  There's a thematic component to the game, which does keep things interesting.

For the right people I know it's a good game, just not for me. Very basic rules, it's just a clumsy guessing/bluffing game, I think other games do this kind of thing better. Note, we gave the game away and its new owners love it. I'd call this baby a hit or miss.

I like this game quite a lot. Some good bluffing and second guessing. The one problem is that it's a bit like playing poker without real money at stake. On the last round, everyone just goes all in. I suppose knowing that now helps play better, but those who think they are behind will have nothing to lose so will still try a big haul. Usualy, whoever is Sheriff gets lots of bribes final round and has an advantage.

Fun negotiation game. It makes me think of a souped-up version of Bullshit, in the sense that you can wheel-and-deal to get contraband cards past the sheriff. Certainly the fun comes from the poker-like aspect of bluffing and playing your opponents, rather than the cards that you've been dealt.

I've played a few times already (only got it a week ago!) and it's a lot of fun. My youngest (8) picked it up right away. Her first couple of games were played without any deceit, but the last one she tricked us all, smuggling a nice load of contraband past us, to her great delight and satisfaction, and even ended up winning the game.

The ability to win by playing an honest game or a deceptive one or some combination thereof is great: I haven't figured out the best mix, and I suspect there is no secret formula for it -- just the right combination of skill and luck.

It's a great, quick, and fairly uncomplicated game that should be on everyone's shelf.

RATING: 5
This is a seemingly solid negotiation game, but since I've discovered that my ability to judge on instinct vastly overshadows my ability to judge peoples bullshit, and hence I do best at the game by not really playing the game, I no longer enjoy it.

It is funny to see the rage on peoples faces when you don't let them argue and just open/leave bags on instinct, then get them all dead on correct, both times that you're the sheriff - Easy Win ;P.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Playing this game was fun. I'm sure it's the kind of game that can be random and overly long with the wrong group, but it can be a hoot with people who spend more time thinking about the theme than the math. Of course, it's not much of a challenge to win against the latter compared to the former. In my play, I quickly concluded that an overall strategy of set collecting legal goods, making it look like I was lying while telling the truth, and lying big when I didn't have a useful hand, with a bribe if necessary, was likely to yield the best return. It did and I won. The others weren't thinking about the game the way I was. That was good for the experience, and it helped me win, but it's not promising for long term replayability. Once everyone realizes how the game works, I think it will devolve into a guessing game. This game is a bit like Poker, but it's much less mathematically interesting. The fun of the game--the bluffing--can be had in less time and with much less overhead with Cockroach Poker.

This game is extremely fun and engaging if you have 5 people to play with and everyone is into roleplaying.  The more convincing or downright outrageous the claims you can make, the more fun it makes the game.  The bluffing and deduction parts of the game are on point and you are never completely certain of what people are bring to the merchant stands.  On my most recent play, I role-played a sheriff who was very intimidating and I scared the people i was playing with bad enough that they loathed when it was my turn to be sheriff.

Overall, this game is always fun to play and the 9 rating comes from if you do not have the right group to play with, otherwise it would be a 10.

Plenty of fun, and it tends to inspire sudden bursts of "awwww, crap" laughter.  My only complaint is that it feels like it's missing a certain something to keep players fully engaged.  My experience so far has been that, in almost every round, at least one player kind of drifts mentally and disengages with the game.

Still, I really enjoy it and it'll be a staple in the collection for some time to come!

RATING: 9
This game proves why Werewolf and its kin are bad games.  This game uses very similar mechanics.  It is a bluffing and negotiation game without any real way to actually deduce who is telling the truth and who isn't.  Much like Werewolf unless you are really good at interrogating people or an absolutely horrible liar a lot of the game boils down to blind guessing on who is telling the truth or not.

So, in more detail, the game has each player playing a merchant trying to get goods into Nottingham from Sherwood Forest.  They do this by secretly putting a certain number of cards in a bag and declaring what is in there.  Each player is only "allowed" to bring in one type of legal good each round.  There are 4 legal goods and a bunch of illegal contraband.  You probably won't win playing the whole game honestly bringing in exactly what you say.  The illegal contraband is worth many more points and there won't be many turns where you have a decent number of just one of the 4 legal goods to bring in.

So that's where the bluffing and negotiation come in.  After you declare what you have to the Sheriff he can interrogate each player and decide which bags to open or let pass.  If a player was lying about anything they lose those goods and pay a penalty (getting to keep what they were telling the truth about) but if they were telling the truth and are inspected the Sheriff pays that player the penalty.

Players can also offer the Sheriff bribes to let them pass.  This is where this becomes such a better game than Werewolf despite boiling down to the same blind guessing as in that game.  There are so many more decision trees involved.  Do you stay confident that you have legal goods hoping the Sheriff lets you pass?  Do you entice him to inspect your bag by offering paltry sums so he pays you a penalty?  Do you outright find a mutually beneficial agreement?  Do you lie about what you have in your bag to give him to get by for free?  Do you negotiate to attack a different player or for future un-binding favors?

And even past the current round you build up an identity and other decisions trees.  That player has been honest for several rounds and any Sheriff that investigated him have paid a price...but is he telling the truth this round?  That player has sneaked by so much contraband, is he continuing his criminal ways or is the heat too hot now and he's laying low?

On top of all that this is a very accessible game and plays reasonably quickly, even with the max player count of 5.  I do recommend playing simultaneously when possible and instituting the time limit for the Sheriff equal to one minute times the number of players.  We only ever hit the time limit once or twice during the whole game but even knowing there is one has a hurrying effect on the Sheriff.

The only problems I can see with this game result in who you play with.  If you have players that just won't "play the game" or get into it then it can be kind of a drag.  For example, we had one player in our first game that outright refused to pay for passage.  This made trying to negotiate with him a little dull and a bit more uninteresting.  We had a nice mix besides him so he didn't really bring down our game but having multiple players like that could definitely sour the experience I think.  Still otherwise a very good game.

Sat down to play this with my gaming group this evening(6/30/15).  At first the other 3 in my group gave me the same looks I get when explaining a game that doesn't go over well.  After explaining the rules they agreed to give it a shot.
After the first two turns everyone was in love with this game.  We played one extra round(3 turns at sheriff) each because we were having such a good time.
Only thing I wish is that it played more than 5 people.

I love games that are fresh and new, those that don't reuse the same mechanics as a hundred other games while only changing the theme. I also love games that pit players against each other and bring in a heavy dose of psychological warfare. Sheriff of Nottingham is just that. It is a surprisingly simple yet incredibly fun game of power, maneuvering, deal-making, and strategy where a quiet introvert can beat a type-A aggressor at his own game! 

Play as merchants intent on bringing as many goods into the market as possible. Legal goods like apples, cheese, bread, and chickens bring a meager income while illegal contraband like pepper, mead, silk, and the coveted crossbow will rake in the coins...but at a substantial price if you get caught by the ever-present sheriff.  

Here's my thought on the strategy: on one end of the spectrum, you have players (usually those who are more conservative and honest at heart!) who stick to almost solely importing legal goods. They bring in a smaller yet consistent income. Beware of these kinds of players, however, because they will act the sweet, innocent merchant then turn around a 5-card sack of contraband! Can you tell I've been burned by them before? On the other side, you have the aggressive, get-rich-quick player who most often has at least a contraband or two in their sack but is willing to pay the Sheriff a hefty price to not take a peek. Each strategy works, but I've found that a good, unpredictable balance works best. 

The artwork is outright impressive. The colors are vibrant and fun which makes for a beautiful game with very high-quality components. For me, this adds immensely to the theme and, ultimately, to my liking or disliking of a game. 

The replay value is very high. The game itself changes moderately each time, but the most fun change is playing with different people. You'll find yourself playing an entirely different game with a completely different strategy depending on the type of people you're playing with. I've played games full of conservative people where bags are checked frequently and the winning score is relatively low. I've also played games with plenty of high-risk, high-return types who gamble for big gains (and big losses!). Usually, you'll have a good mix of personality types which makes for a very fun, rounded game. 

Overall, I give Sheriff of Nottingham a very high 8.5. This is an excellent game for all types of gamers, experienced or not. Those of us "game nerds" who love the intensely strategic games really enjoy it, but I also played with several very moderate gamers who absolutely loved it. Very well done!

A fun game about lying and deception and calling bull shit.  I enjoy the strategy of telling the truth but being so suspicious that everyone accuses me all the time.  Good fun.

Players take turns playing the sheriff, who can be bluffed or bribed into letting each other player's goods pass uninspected, or can open up the bag and take a look -- if the hapless traveller is innocent, the sheriff pays a penalty, but a caught smuggler must pay to get out of trouble and loses their contraband to boot.

The only "social deduction" games I can stomach have more deduction and less social in them than this one; there is too little information for either the bluff or negotiation to really work. It's particularly annoying that the original theme of modern smuggling -- with neat little suitcases in the Hart an der Grenze version! -- was changed to this nonsense.

The length is a little much, too, if you get into the negotiation. And if you don't, why play? Far better off playing something like Coup or In a Grove where the player dynamics comes to the fore.

Social deduction game of the Sheriff - players have to decide as the sheriff who is lying and who is telling the truth sheriff can take bribes to not inspect a bribe. If the person is completely honest than the sheriff has to pay a penalty but if not then the player getting inspected has to. Players can keep all the declared legal items in the bag. At the end scoring is done based on legal items as well as number of contraband. Players have to decide how much a bribe would be worth to not get discovered or they can bribe to screw over other players as well.

Carmen thinks this one is fun. She loves the theme, and is really good at bluffing and social deception games. Definitely her thing. I've mentioned elsewhere how BAD I am at bluffing games. So, yeah, this is not a Steph "10" kind of game. However, if I'm going to practice bluffing, this is a fun one to play while completely bumbling my way through. The rule book is kind of long, so I thought the game was harder than it really is. It's easy to teach and easy to learn for new players. It's a good party game. Maybe if I drank I would be better at this...?

An awesome game which just gets better with every play. 

Usually takes a couple of rounds for new players to get but no longer than that.

Have only played with adults so far but I think kids would be good at it too. 

It revolves around bluffing and fibbing, and is pretty satisfying to be honest when you sneak contraband into the city.

It makes for a great start or end of gaming session game, well worth a purchase.

RATING: 3.75
Eh... I wanted to like it due to all the hype but it feels so luck based. You can tell the truth and never check anyone's bag and still win simply by getting lots of good cards.

I do want to try it again with the old Robin Hood rules and carts that I think might make it more interesting and focused on bluffing.

EDIT: Played it 3 times now and the game just isn't for me. There is too little information to go on for deciding to believe or call someone. Also, bad players can gie the game to another person too easily. The game takes too long for what it is and requires too much roleplaying to make it passable. Just not a very enjoyable experience overall when there are other bluffing / negotiation games out there.

'Sheriff' is mostly breezy: you consider your hand and your dealer, then you wager, then you defend your bluff. I like all that. Endgame scoring is kinda terrible though.

The snap-bags absolutely make the game. The best moment in Sheriff is tugging the felt edge of a sealed pouch, praying that your smug look will draw your opponent's tell.

How fun is it to be greedy, bribe the Sheriff, smuggle illegal items through the gates of town, and get crowned the Chicken King?  Pretty dang fun. Over before you want it to be, tense, tricky, and doublecrossing, this is probably the best social deduction game you can buy.  

Everyone takes turns playing the Sheriff, which means you are responsible for managing all the goods going to market and checking for certain things King John thinks shouldn't be in the hands of the commoners (fine linens, exotic spices, CROSSBOWS, golden apples, etc).  The other players take their goods to market in their merchant bags and have to pass an inspection made by the Sheriff...by any means necessary. Bribing and lying to the Sheriff to get him to allow your goods through WITHOUT an inspection is very common, and definitely makes the game what it is.  The only people that I've seen not enjoy this game are those that just can't handle the mental trickery and bribing.  I highly recommend this one.

I can see why people like it, but good lord am I terrible at bluffing. Probably a 7-8 for someone who likes the game type. I'd personally avoid it just because my play is probably worse than random.

Still, I enjoy it more than other games of its genre, because the bluffing is done primarily 1-on-1, and because the setting and mechanics allow for entertaining nonsense if you're not really in contention for a win. (That is, there's no social obligation to take things too seriously, unlike other bluffing games where you're probably letting two or three other players down with your own weakness. Because each direct negotiation happens exactly 4 times, everyone has an equal chance to exploit how bad you are.)

I nice bluffing and set-collection game. It is a bit too unstructured for my tastes.

This could have been easily fixed by also giving a king/queen bonus to the players who have the most/2nd most contraband at the end of the game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I generally don't like bluffing games that rely almost entirely on whether or not you think someone is lying.  I prefer games like [thing=9220][/thing] where you can read people's actions instead of just their words.  

That said, [thing=157969][/thing] was pretty fun.  The bluffing was still pretty random and not my cup of tea, but there is enough of the set collection, smuggling, and deal making to make this more of a negotiation game than just a bluffing game.  I also like that you can immediately see after each round if each player was lying, so you can use the information to help with future bluffs.

This game is great for parties and good for families. Really does work well with 3-5 players. The cards and components are good, and while it's a good game and one that I like, but don't love it. I enjoy the interaction, and strategy can change a little, and there is some replayability, but games will always resemble each other(and still be somewhat different), and scoring at the end is not complicated, but takes a little too long at the end. However, it's a ton of fun to house rule that everyone speaks in an accent, and lying to your friends or family is sometimes fun.

This game should be considered a classic, due it's simplicity, accessibility, uniqueness and brilliance of play. I often wonder why more games haven't tried to follow in the footsteps of Sheriff. The timed negotiation invokes tense discussion, the bluffing and deal making is well contained yet also open to good possibilities, and the app is a hilarious addition to the game. It has all the hallmarks of a great bluffing game. It's just shy of perfection due to the balancing issue, but even that can be thwarted with meta gaming, and may also be heavily improved upon with the expansion (which could change my rating).

Not bad, but it seems like a good strategy is to just be honest and bring in sets of legal goods every turn. I've seen it happen at least once, and I've read online that it happens quite a bit. The game is also very mathy and it's possible to give somebody the win if players aren't paying attention and are just making offers without thinking it through. If you offer the sheriff a lot of money to open someone's bag, and the sheriff then finds contraband, they have usually made a ton of money with pretty much no risk.
My biggest issue is that there just isn't enough information to go on when you're the sheriff. If a player offers a lot of money to not open their bag, maybe they're bluffing and maybe not. If they offer nothing, maybe they're bluffing and maybe not. It's pretty much just a guessing game. I prefer Coup for a similar bluffing game experience because you at least have the card count (just 15 total cards) and the faceup cards of your opponents to help with deduction, and the diplomat can help give you even more information to go on. Plus it plays a lot faster.

I've seen several people complain about the end-game scoring and I really don't understand why. You see who has the most cards of each of the four types and you hand out money accordingly. Add up the value of all of your cards. Add that to your money. That's it.

This game can make for some fun moments, but it just doesn't hold up to repeated plays.

Sold.

This game is a blast.  There is something about looking at someone and lying, I'm mean "bluffing" that just embraces fun and laughter.  At it's core this is a very simple game of either telling the truth or not but it is deeper than that.  There is a set collection strategy and knowing when to bluffing aspect to this game that is really cool.  I also love the fact that when it's not your turn you are still involved.  GREAT GAME and one that will stay in my collection forever!!!

There just doesn't feel like there's much to Sherrif. On every turn you make a decision, bluff or don't bluff. Unlike a game like Poker, there's very little public information so you have little to inform your decision of when to call someone's bluff.

So much fun! Very nice looking and just makes for very funny situations! I love trying to trick friends and family in this, or even get busted with a huge load of contrabands. Looking someone straight in the eye and telling them not to check your bag while you actually want to be checked, or the other way around - great great fun. In my group though, we gotta have quite some time to play this. So far it works way better if we take our time and joke around than if we try to be quick about it, but that might change with future plays. 

Really love that this game is so much fun with this few players - so many similar games require a lot of players, which isn't always possible. Great game!

This game is a HUGE hit in my game group - to the extend where multiple people bought it. After seeing the guys from The Dice Tower play this game on a couple of their streams, I knew I had to buy it.

I do play with a slightly different rule, where you have 1 extra card in hand but aren't allowed to pick cards up from the discard pile. It makes the game slightly more random (meaning people have to lie more) and it speeds the game up tremendously, as people aren't constantly sifting through the discard piles.

Role-playing your role definitely adds a lot more flavour to this game. Without it, the game would still be great, just slightly less fun.

RATING: 5
Players take turns as the Sheriff of Nottingham. On your turn as sheriff, all the other players tell you how many cards they're putting into a sealed bag. They might be honest traders sending apples, bread, cheese or chickens. But they might also be sneaking contraband like silk, crossbows, etc. Your job as sheriff is to decide who's being dishonest and which bags to open. If you catch a smuggler, they lose the smuggled goods and pay you a hefty fine. If you harass an honest businessman, you have to compensate him for wasting his time.

As a trader you can bribe the sheriff to look the other way, or even to open someone else's bag. The main part of the game is bluffing or faking a bluff, and encouraging the sheriff to check other people's bags.

At the game end you get points for everything you shipped. There are awards for whoever ships the most of a particular type of good. And contraband items are generally a lot more valuable than basic goods.

This is an interesting game but it feels more like a party game for gamers than anything else.

About [thing=157969][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=157969][/thing] is a set collection coupled with bluffing and negotiation. With the purpose of taking goods to Nottingham, players could simply be taking regular and legal goods. But they could also be bringing contraband, which by themselvers are worth much more in a 1-to-1 basis against the legal goods. However, if the Sheriff finds this, the merchant will have to pay a fine and will lose de contraband. While this is good for the Sheriff, his job isn't easy, after all, he is greedy and can't really trust people, so even when people are saying the truth about what they have in their bag, he might be inclined to open it and, then, he will be in a monerary problem, having to pay a fee to the honest merchant.

The game works with deals and traps made by and between the players. One can try to bluff the Sheriff into making him open her bag and pay a hefty fee, other may try to reffuse any deal, to appear 100% honest in his business, while carrying 4 contraband.

This is the game: bluff, double bluff, dares, deals, threats, vying for opportunities and measuring the ratio of danger and reward.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
One player in the round will be the Sheriff, all the others will be the merchants. Everyone has a hand of 6 cards and, in order, can trade up to 5 cards with those discarded in earlier rounds (at the start of the game some are discarded with this purpose). Then, every player puts from 1 to 5 cards of the same type, if legal, or of any type, if it is contraband, in her bag and say to the Sheriff what she is carrying - the player must name the exact quantity and name one legal good, even if she isn't carrying any, but if she does, she must say the name of this good. For instance:

P1 puts 3 apples in the bad. Says: "Im carrying 3 apples to the city, Sheriff."
P2 puts 2 breads and 1 contraband. Says: "Im carrying 3 breads to the city, Sheriff."
P3 puts 2 contrabands. Says: "Im carrying 2 chickens to the city, Sheriff."

In the inspection phase, the Sheriff can make deals with the merchants and open whatever bag he wants. If he makes a deal, he gives back the bag, without opening it - the merchant reveals the content of legal goods and put them on the proper area of the player board; contraband aren't totally revealed: they stay face down, but is possible to see the quantity. Therefore the Sheriff would know he got dupped.

If no deal is reached. The Sheriff can simply return, begrudgingly, the bag to a player, or opt to open it. If he does open, two things can happen:
a) The merchant player was saying the truth, so the Sheriff must pay a fee to the merchant in the value indicated in that good card. Say if the Sheriff opened the bag of P1. Those 3 apples would set the Sheriff back 6 coins (2 for each apple);
b) The merchant player was laying. The merchant pays a fine, in the value indicated in the contraband cards, to the Sheriff, and also loses the contraband cards, but the legal goods the merchant keep.

After this, the Sheriff token is passed to the next player, everyone draws cards until they have 6 cards in hand, and a new round will start.

Once everyone was Sheriff twice, the game ends. For each type of legal good the players will see who is the King (having the most of it) and the Queen (the second most), as these positions will earn extra points. All the goods are scored equal to their values, the same for the contraband (but these don't have a majority). The player with the most money will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Going by round, the first is to trade or not. This tends to become less important as the game carries one, since the discard pile start to get filled with contraband. And people, while maybe wanting to take contraband, don't want to be seen by the Sheriff when drawing them! But, in the early rounds, helps a lot to create believable stories: if you take a Cheese from the discard, saying that you are carrying 4 Cheese sounds more likely than before.

Second is what to put in the bag. Both in quantity and in type. The higher the number, the harder is to convince the Sheriff that what you are taking is what you are saying it is. For most purposes, is better to fill the bag with all legal goods. You have no worries, no need to deal with the Sheriff, and gain the chance to bluff the Sheriff into opening your bag, and gaining the fee money. There is no downside. Well, at least until you don't want to simply carry 2 lousy apples. Since players can only take one type of legal good, sometimes you will have a hand of contraband and a sorted type of varied legal goods. Yes, you can even put a single card in the bag, but it is worth it? Usually it won't. So, eventually you might find yourself having to take contraband. First is necessary to calculate how much is worth. More is better, yes. But also calls for more attention, and the fine you will have to pay, if discovered, will be higher. It is not a hard thing to think about, but it is a decision.

Also, in this phase, is important to consider the majorities. It might be more worth to you to take that 2 lousy apples than 3 better chickens, simply because it could be enough to net you first or second place in the majority of apples. Still, more often than not that will be a decision that the blind draw will make for you.

Third, is in the negotiation with the Sheriff. Even when carrying all legal goods and having no need at all to negotiate, it can be worth. However, you will want to look suspicious and make the Sheriff open your bag, since, with this, he will need to pay you a fee for hassling your business. For the merchant carrying contraband, the same is valid, as being suspicious can work as a double bluff: are you trying to look suspicious or are you indeed a criminal? Since several times players are just trying to trap the Sheriff, is hard for it to separate the good from the bad.

For the Sheriff all of his decisions are in this negotation phase. Open or not. Pondering about the amounts (considering what was already revealed and the total in the deck), about the risk and reward of opening a bag. Trying to squeeze as much as possible, both of money and of information, from the merchants. It is not esasy, specially because you can have a roun in which everyone is taking legal goods, and the only option that is good to you is to let everyone pass - but considering that players are only Sheriff twice, it is very, very hard to not open at least one bag each time. A good Sheriff's turn is when you don't lose money.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Great production value, going from art, quality of cards and of the players boards;
- High interaction between players;
- Language independant;
- Small set of rules and easy to start playing;
- It is very fun to see people talking their way out or into situations.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The increase in value for the legal goods, due to the majorities, made the game less of a negotiation and more of traps;
- One can win by simply passing legal goods all the time, without any risk whatsoever;
- The box is huge when compared with that of [thing=104640][/thing], its antecessor.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Mostly like going through customs while carrying way above the limit of goods to enter back in the country after a trip. Should you declare it? You will pay a fee, but all will be good - but you might feel you just lost, since you could have entered without spending a dime more than you already did. Even more, the money is on top of some already way too high taxes you pay for everything, and you don't even agree with the way it is spent, when it is spent, after all, most is simply "lost" due to corruption anyway. You would be basically giving money to thieves. 

Well, maybe in your country isn't like this. But [thing=157969][/thing] was, first, [thing=104640][/thing], which, in turn, was [thing=22237][/thing], which was [thing=3705][/thing]. When Sérgio Halaban and André Zatz, the designers, took [thing=22237][/thing], they did as to look like the border between Brazil and Paraguay - a place where, in Ciudad Del Este, they sell a lot of, well, contraband. It was (and still is, but way less due to the decrease of value of our currency in face of the dollar) usual for business in Brazil to go there to buy lots of illegal goods and bring them into Brazil. That border was a roulette. Some will get pull to the side and get caught, and would either lose the goods or would need to pay a fee. Most would pass. It was a gamble, and was known that some workers - of customs and police - could be paid to "look the other way", but these was only true for the big things, as small business people and individual folk would risk in the roulette.

[thing=157969][/thing] is like this, only in a much more innocent setting, which can even make the contraband a way to stick to the evil rulers, to help the rebellion. Better for families. 

I would have liked [thing=157969][/thing] more if I didn't already know [thing=104640][/thing]. [thing=157969][/thing] is a fun game, sure. But one, for me, inferior to [thing=104640][/thing], as it made the legal goods too valuable, enough for players to win only with them. This is nice, when playing a friendly game, with, say, family. In [thing=104640][/thing] players need to pass contraband, or they will lose. This means that there were a LOT more laying, bluffing, and deals being made. There is much more tension and fun in [thing=104640][/thing]. [thing=157969][/thing] is just a waterdown version. But is the one you will find to sell, and is good enough on its own right - it isn't bad because is worst than [thing=104640][/thing], because [thing=104640][/thing] is very good.

If you can, find [thing=104640][/thing], go for it. It is better, and comes in a box around 6x times smaller, while carrying basically the same game. Still, if you can't, [thing=157969][/thing] will do just fine.

Fun bluffing game, where you're trying to sneak contraband past the Sheriff for that round.

Super fun game to play if your group is in the "right mood". Most important thing to notice is that at least in my opinion this is actually not a bluffing game but rather a negotiation game. Basically this means that the Sheriff should NOT always open the bag if he knows that there is contraband but rather make a deal. This encourages bluffing and deeper strategy since if the Sheriffs open bags very easily it means that the guys who always tell the truth win basically every time. If that happens the game easily devolves into terrible game (since telling the truth is only luck of the draw -> game turns into a coin flip contest where lying is not an option). Works very well with some drinking involved. I think that my rating will go up if the upcoming expansion makes the lying more profitable.

I'm very impressed.  I have a pretty large collection of games that involve lying/bluffing and this is one of the best.  There aren't a lot of games where the role playing comes naturally as a result of the theme and mechanics, but this game accomplishes that perfectly.  The presentation is stellar (except one of my bags broke on literally the first play...).  Even so, I would highly recommend this one.

A bluffing game at its finest. When it's your turn as the Sheriff, you have to try to figure out who (if anyone,) is trying to smuggle in contraband. The back-and-forth of bribe offering and tension as you decide whether or not to open someone's bag is really fun and interesting. Same when you are a merchant. Do you risk trying to smuggle in a bunch of contraband this round or play it safe and put only legal goods in your bag and hope you can get the Sheriff to open it? All of that decision-making and negotiating makes this an amazing game.

SoN is essentially a bluffing game that tries to incorporate elements of deal making, bribery and backstabbing in the design. There are shades of Intrigue in SoN but it doesn't work nearly as well. Any bribes, promises or paybacks can be carried over between rounds but does not need to be honored. However, this doesn't seem to work nearly as well in SoN as most deals played out in the present round and not carried forward. Overall, the negotiation phase is more structured than Intrigue and hence, fewer opportunities to walk back on your promises. 

The game does drag a little in terms of negotiations and can get bogged down if not moving at a fast enough pace. Meta game is probably important and playing with the same folks a few times can establish a pattern. Taking risks in contraband appears very important for winning the game as the points obtained from contraband is high. It is tough being Sheriff as you get penalized for inspecting bags for bona fide goods and most of the time, the contraband payoff is just not as lucrative to offset the penalties. This makes taking bribes the default path.

This game will work for some and not for others. Folks who hate lying, cheating and backstabbing will likely not love the game.

It's fun but has quite a few flaws. Gets much more praise than it deserves. Read the forums and you'll find many that agree. If you want to play a bluffing game, The Resistance offers a tighter experience (although requires a few more players than this).

There's just not enough moving parts in here to make for an engaging experience.  What surprises me, is that many folks consider Sheriff a good party game. :/ Really? A max 5 player game that takes over an hour?  For a party?  Ok then, umm, you guys have fun.  The rest of us will all be in the lounge playing Resistance, Werewolf, Cash 'n Guns, 2-Rooms...

This is our default game when people who don't play games come over.

Unless you have someone in the crowd who's morally opposed to lying (and we had one), it's a hoot.

If you play to win, it won't be nearly as much fun as if you play it for the fun it is.

This was one of my favourite games as I started gaming. After repeat plays though, the game sort of needs house rules. The 'honest player strategy' wins every time if utilized, which is boring. But I don't like the idea of having to add house rules.

That being said, it's still a great game to introduce to new gamers. I just barely feel like playing anymore.

our family really enjoys playing this one. I enjoy telling little white lies to begin with, so I feel like this game is geared towards people like me that like to "pull people's leg". It's easy to set up, doesn't take long to grasp or play a full game, it's a good game to play while having drinks, and victory isn't necessarily based on strategy. And the end of the day it's a great light hearted game that doesn't require much to hit the table.

An entertaining but occasionally frustrating party game focused around bluffing and bribery. Gameplay is extremely simple, but the scoring gets a little heavy on arithmetic right at the end, which is at odds with the 90% of the game devoted to telling believable lies.

This game is a family favorite!  The object of the game is to bring "goods" to market, and sometimes extra "contraband" may be smuggled in with your chickens and bread in order to earn extra points.  Each player takes a turn as the sheriff whose job it is to stop contraband from entering the city.  Bluffing and bribes ensue, making for a very entertaining game! Even the most competitive players in our family lighten up and enjoy the fun!!!

Pros: bluffing & bartering mechanics, set collection, high player interaction

Cons: limited strategic & tactical options

My opinion of this game has completely changed with a few more plays, as I used to see very little benefit to bribing the sheriff to prevent inspection. Turns out I had just never seen it done effectively, and there is certainly a skill in negotiating and bluffing your way to accomplishing this. Definitely a fun game full of laughs, as the sheriff ponders whether or not people are lying about their declared goods. Also a great game for five, which can be an awkward player count for many other games.

Nice, pure game of bluff and double-cross.  The game itself is little more than a sparse framework to lie to your friends.  It's like playing poker, except that virtually every hand is a crap hand.  The sheriff player has to do a combination of deduction, people-reading, and just plain luck to get his way.  You can choose to skim a little off the top, usually, but does that mean they're just going to get through with a huge amount of contraband?

I've had this game taught to me two different ways.  One had much harsher penalties for lying.  I'm not sure which was the correct way, but the framework worked for both sessions, so I think it's a good game regardless.

The game does sometimes outstay its welcome, but it's so pure that it will keep most games going well.  If you want to make sure the game stays fast-paced, try doing a practice sheriff round so that the players know what they're doing, and then only do the Sheriff role once around the table rather than twice.

And, uh, what does this game have to do with Robin Hood?  The original theme made more sense.

Not much of game in the sense I think of, bluffing, double bluffing and counter bluffing. Seems that if you get good sets of green stuff, it is quite easy to win.

If a pure bluffing game is your thing, you can't go wrong here. It can be a very fun experience, just not a very good game. My biggest problems with the game:

- Often the best strategy is not to lie at all through the entire game.

- It goes on too long for a party/social game

- You have to spend 5-10 minutes at the end to count up points, which feels odd considering it is such a light party game.

I haven't laughed this hard playing a game in a very long time. I've heard it said that when the players are providing the entertainment, it's a sign of a weak game. While I see the wisdom in that, I'm not sure it applies to Sheriff of Nottingham.

The reason is that this game can be mathed out. It is easy to calculate payouts for any given bag, fairly easy to track what cards are in play and certainly easy enough to calculate profitable bribes for both sides, so there is a solid economic game here. Above the table though, separated from all that, the stage is set for comedic gold. Watching people try to negotiate, bribe, cajole, justify and flat out beg for favors is unbelievably entertaining.

I think this is worth a 10 rating, fun wise. I'm going to low ball it a little, because I suspect that the luster will fade a bit when played repeatedly with the same group. (I think all social engineering games tend toward this, even Battlestar Galactica and The Resistance start to lose something once you learn everyone's tendencies.)

Solid bluffing / negotiation game.  I enjoy this one, but it does have some drawbacks.  Namely, gameplay can feel overly processional at times, and end of game scoring is absurdly tedious.

Look, it's fine. Try it, if you like it, it's fine. I've played way too many bluffing games & there's too much math in this - not in a bad way of having to do it, but in the sense that it easily overrules the bluffing/is way too calculable. The accounting at endgame is just flat-out not fun. I'd have preferred the original theme with metal suitcases, too.

RATING: 9
Sheriff of Nottingham is a social deduction game with some negotiation thrown in. Players will take on the roles of merchants that are trying to sell their wares, while also tolerating the strict laws and bans of various goods. One player plays as the sheriff each round, who will try and gauge whether or not players are lying about the contents of their bags. A large appeal to this game is the fact that players do not have to lie to win. In fact, it is very likely that players can win while playing honestly the whole session. This is due to the penalties that are placed on the sheriff for investigating an innocent player, as well as the bonuses for accumulating large amounts of legal goods.

Players take turn being the Sheriff. Other players, acting as Merchants, will attempt to bring their goods into the city for profit. Beware though, while many may act as honest merchants, there is always the possibility of contraband being smuggled into the city!
Merchants can try to bribe the sheriff, to not inspect their goods, but if he finds contraband they have to pay a fine. If they were honest merchantsthe sheriff has to pay for the inconvenience.
Also known as "Customs" or "What's in the bag you bastard!"

This game falls flat to me as the gameplay gets very repetitive - after all, how many times can you negotiate about the same thing before it gets boring? If you want this game to stay fresh, play it only ocasionally. 

The final scoring takes way too much time and effort to treat Sheriff of Nottingham as a party game (unless you use the app, this helps a lot).

A very entertaining bluffing game with nice components and a clever theme.

It has been a big hit with my family and for good reason.

I take most reviews with a grain of salt, and as such I take most review[b]ers[/b] with a grain of salt as well, but when it comes to his favorite game, Tom Vasel and I see eye-to-eye. So when he says he's launching a line of games that he considers [i]essential[/i], he has my attention. I saw this come up for pre-order and Gen Con pickup and I handed over my money fast.

After playing it once now, I can see why Tom wanted this in his Dice Tower Essentials. It's a quick game, easy to teach, and leads to some interesting decisions and fun bluffing. I really do like how you can play honest and win, but if there's enough contraband trading going on, you might have issues which creates [i]just enough[/i] pressure.

I'm not sure there are many downsides to the game other than you should understand that it's mostly about bluffing, so if that's not your thing, you probably won't have a good time. Also, be sure that you're paying attention to the sets and are trying to achieve king or queen because diversification won't win you the game, it'll only let you bluff a bit better.

Players are merchants bringing into Nottinghame apples, cheese, bread, chickens and contraband (if they can get away with it). Each round the players take turns playing the role of the Sheriff whose responsibility is to keep contraband out of the city and make sure merchants are bringing into town what they declare. Extra points for food majorities. Catchy, fun, and light weight card game with great interaction through bluffing, looking for player tells, and negotiating with bribes. You can even bribe the sheriff to check the other player's packet. Will you crack under the careful scrutiny of the sheriff, threatening to open your packet?

A great game of bluffing, bribing, and extortion. With the right group of people this reasonably short game of slipping goods past each other (and trying to catch them) becomes an experience. Note: it is also good that people can win without bluffing too.

The expansion adds modules to add for the more experienced crowd.

Relies too much on player interaction, not really much actual game here. Bluffing aspect is fairly light and rather depends entirely on player dynamics. Players can bribe the sheriff, which really just tells the sheriff whether or not you're trying to sneak stuff through.

RATING: 7.2
It really helps to get into the mood with this one and role play a little with your character as I imagine that without that element it wouldn't work so well. But with that element this game is a real hoot with both kids (who love to role play and lie (bluff)) and adults.

Very good bluffing game. The downside to this one is that there isn't much to go on except whether you think the other person is trying to scam you or not. A bit light.

Love the idea of lying and catching liars, but I found that this game is too random with no strategy. You can act weird to try to get the sheriff to call you out or act normal to try to stay hidden or vice versa. The sheriff cannot ever make an informed decision on who's carrying contraband. Also, it seems super strong to lie for 1 really big contraband take and then be honest the rest of the game

It's sort of fun. It's like poker. Do i trust you or not? The downside is that there is 0,0 indication of someone's "hand", like in poker, making it a random bluff game and less fun. It's too simple and lacks something intuitive.

Bluffing at its finest. Simple and fun. You have four different types of legal goods and four different types of illegal goods, as well as special illegal goods. You may put whatever you like in the bag and then you must claim only one type of legal good. You could just be honest. But, c'mon, no one stays honest in this game. You can bribe the sheriff to look the other way. This game is pure fun as you try to smuggle in cards to help you get the most points. I love being the sheriff and also getting contraband past the sheriff. This is another game I think everyone should own.

RATING: 7
A 3-5 player bluffing game. Players take turn trying to pass goods past a player who is the sheriff. If the sheriff inspects their bag and finds illicit goods, they have to pay a fine. But inspecting a bag of honest goods means the sheriff has to pay.

7.5 after 1 play.

Neat artwork coupled with good quality components makes for a attractive looking game. Perhaps only the sheriff is on the ugly side, probably intentionally so. The game is easy to teach and learn and is also very interactive, with lots of bluffing. The strategy is not very involved and may lead to lower replayability. It may also require more players than less to be fun and may not be that scalable.

The social aspect of this game makes it great for the pub. I enjoy the bluffing and making deals it has a good amount of play to it. As always these games live and die depending on the social interaction of the players, I played this with a good bunch of people so that leaves me feeling positive about the game.

Something about Sheriff of Nottingham left me pretty flat.  Maybe it was because nobody in my first game really did anything with the bribery aspect of the game, but I think it had more to do with so much going on at once that it was hard to keep track of everyone and sense when they might or might not be bluffing.  I prefer social deduction games where people have to carry the same bluff round to round or throughout the game so you can feel them out over time much better.  So... this is something I'd play again if someone was excited about it, but I can't see ever requesting it.

Bluffing game. Played once. I don't think its for me. The deals you can make are quite linear. No future deals allowed which means you are pretty much going to have to give cash or a good or something -- so if you offer such items, then aren't you just saying there is something in the bag?   I don't get this concept at all.

Why would the sheriff say, oh okay I'll take your money; when its clear that money offered equals bad things in bag.

I think the strategy to this is also quite light, just say the truth and every now and again lie.

Not for me.

We finally got this to the table last night with 4 players.  I was worried how it might play out with my group but it went over extremely well.  A different game than anything else I own, a perfect mix of role playing, interaction, card collecting, and of course bluffing.  "Sheriff" is accessible to any group regardless of gaming experience. Fantastic game that I can't wait to try again.

Solid production and very entertaining game but Sheriff of Nottingham is not for every group. The game lives a lot on the way the group interacts. otherwise the game easily can become boring
Telling truth seems too viable, undermines the lying aspect of the game. To me, it is basically broken that it can easily be won without ever taking risk, or very little

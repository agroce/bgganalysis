Has a good pace. On my 2nd play and the other guys 1st it only took 2hrs, which is pretty awesome for an A&A game! The sequence of play cards are a neat idea.

I liked this one, but my first play indicated it might be slanted towards the defender (Germany).  I think an awful lot of the momentum is determined by the Naval Bombardment rolls, as my pillboxes were able to kill a lot of units before they ever hit the sand.  Planes were not as effective as I thought they would be, they are just reasonably easy to work around.

Gorgeous game. All the components are simply beautiful. Nice detail in the pieces and the map is one of the clearest I've ever encountered. Objectives and landing areas are well differentiated. The rulebook is done as an old army intelligence file - scratched and aged and reads very well.

The game practically teaches you as you go. The unique order card system that incorporates the sequence of play, leads players through the game. The battle board shows offense & defense numbers for each piece. One the the few wargames where reading the rulebook before you play isn't an absolute necessity. Good old fashioned gaming fun. Bravo Hasbro/WOTC/AH!

It is a game with clear rulebook, simple gameplay...however, playing as Axis is boring, which the only strategy is moving the units into those 3 goal cities and waiting for the Allies to attack

Played once where the Germans eliminated the allied armies entirely. What's left is but a few tanks on board. 

Not a historical game at all. But pretty good dice rollIng fun for a 2 hour game.

'Dicey' easy to play game.  Has some new mechanics such as allied air power rules and one round battles (instead of the fight to the death).  There is no build phase typical of A&A games, reinforcements are given per a schedule.  Game is extremely unbalanced in favor of the Allies.  Game play is so-so.  The components are excellent.

Don't bother with the fortune cards. Nice idea, but they make the game longer and don't add much to it.

A good game in the A&A series. This game remains pretty historically accurate to the invasion of Europe while still offering balance of gameplay and a good selection of tactics for players. This version also includes Fortune and Tactics cards to add a bit more variety. A good buy while it's still easily available.

RATING: 5
A MAJOR improvement on Risk! A MAJOR improvement on Axis&Allies! A good strategy is useful, but it is impossible to win without good luck. But because of the luck factor, I think it is quite re-playable: you'll never know whom Lady Luck will allow to occupy Normandy.

RATING: 7
The Battle of Normandy has interested me since I was a kid so maybe that's why I rate this game higher than average.But the feel of the game, to me at least, is tense. The Fortune cards can change your plans in a moment. and the Tactics cards, although some are a little farfetched, add decisions as well. But it does seem strange to have the board almost clear of units at game end.

Nice for a couple of plays. Not unenjoyable, but I doubt about game balance. Hasbro didn't take too much effort to produce a top game (apart from the appearance).

It is clear that Hasbro took [gameid=730] as an blueprint for this game. However they forget to take over the victory condition from this game: leaving the map on the south edge (in other words achieving a breakout), instead of taking Cherbourg, St.Lo and Caen. This would have lead to a much more interesting game. Now the endgame will only focus on the conquest of these three cities.

I also miss a turntrack. I would like to know where I am historically.

Like this game. Played a number of times. The card mechanic was an interesting change from the usual A&A.

Except for one game where the Allies didn't even manage to get a beach head (got skunked bad) the games have been pretty tight with no side seeming to have a clear advantage.

I really wanted to like this game, but the sheer reliance on randomness of the dice for resolution can warp a well thought out game. In one game the Allied player took so many hits they were wiped off 3 beaches, lost both bombers, had rolled 3,24,3,5 on reinforcements, and had taken out only 2 gun emplacements. Brutal. By turn 4 there was no point in playing. It needs a more sophisitcated combat system that mitigates random anlmalies, because everyting else is there.

Received as a gift because had been playing the original a couple of times, and enjoyment was in evidence.  Was pleased with the gift, but when I played it, it just didn't seem to have the same "something" that the original has.  I enjoy it to a point, and my boys love playing with the pieces, but I keep thinking that something is missing.  I don't know what it is.  I will applaud it for a "definite end."  I appreciate that it doesn't go on forever.  Will have to take it out again soon and see if I can identify what is missing.

Jogo cujo tema é a Segunda Guerra Mundial, especificamente o conflito entre tropas Aliadas e do Eixo que se seguiu ao Dia D, o desembarque de tropas aliadas na Normandia, região costeira ao norte da França ocupada. Para 2 ou 3 jogadores, com duração de 10 rodadas (1,5 - 2 horas). Regras fáceis de aprender e executar. Destaque para as muitas miniaturas de plástico, esculpidas na forma de unidades militares reais, uma característica da série Axis & Allies, e para o tabuleiro com arte do mapa da Normandia.

RATING: 7
Looks like they blended in a few features from Fortress America: Limited pool of reinforcing pieces; stacking limits within each territory; cards which affect the flow of reinforcements and conduct of battle on the board. Game is 8-9 during the first 5 turns, but drops to a 6-7 after the reinforcements dry up. This is because gamey tactics to husband and position your forces start to dominate your decisions and the map no longer resembles a battle front but a chessboard. Production is of superior quality, but the type on the cards and play aids is entirely too small considering their size. Not up to par with the new global war game in the system, but still great fun!  Upgraded to an 8 after I realized how much I enjoy the game.

We all know the result of this battle in the real history, as this game was designed to have similar result, with German forces also have a change to win the game by holding on one of three cities untill turn 10. Fortune cards will make the game more interesting because it can cause the game result different from what we expect. As for German forces player, please watch out for your tank units value when you as defender,if you miss this, the game result will be a whole lots of difference.

RATING: 9
This game is awesome! I love It

What I like:
The Strafing. No other A&A game (let alone strategy game) has this feature. which I find not only important to the ally cause, but to the games mechanics.
The cards. The cards are high quality, and, without the order cards, chaos would reign, and we would spend more time in the rule book, than in the game.
ALL....THE.....UNITS! Holy crap, the. amount of units this game comes with is overwhelming! (mainly for the germans though.) so, it will add quite a few to 1942:second edition.

What I dislike:
The setup takes FOREVER! Do Not Shake The Table! (DNST)

Germany is overpowered slightly, so extreme strategy needed for the allies.

This game came out in 2004 as a tribute to the 60th anniversary of the Normandy landings. As such it did a lot better than Mem '44 in my opinion despite the dismal rankings it gets in comparison. The two games are roughly equivalent in complexity whereas Mem '44 is more tactical (abstractly so in my view) and A&A: D-Day more operational its depiction. I just don't care for the Battle Cry engine; so, the scenario recreation and classic war game flow to A&A: D-Day just finds my sweet spot far better when a beer and pretzels experience with a high fun factor is what I'm looking for.

This game is seriously under-rated and I'm not sure why. Perhaps the A&A stigma? The Battle Cry series comes closer to a miniatures type experience on a board than the A&A "scenario" series but one I can't begin to relate to while the A&A scenario games remind me more of what I liked from the "old" Avalon Hill back in the day...

RATING: 5
Rather scripted variant of Axis & Allies, you don't purchase units. Also your activations etc are determined by a stack of cards. Saying that it's still a relatively short and enjoyable game, but I wonder how much replayability it has. Also doesn't really work with 3, definitely a 2-player game.

Variante de la serie Axis and Allies. No me gusta demasiado, porque es muy "mata-mata". Representa el día del desembarco y la dinámica es similar al Axis and Allies, pero no hay compras.. los refuerzos los tienes desde el principio. Es un card-driven, y permite incluir también cartas tácticas y de fortuna. Entretenido, pero me gusta mucho menos que el original.

I hate almost everything about this game. Too few choices - all actions are preset. All units are forced to come in at specific locations in specific order. Just very unenjoyable all around.

Good theme and components, like any A&A game, moves it out from a 1 or 2 rating.

While I mostly liked my playing of this game, there were two obvious concerns.  First, Germany more or less plays itself.  Second, the game is so short that dice don't really have a chance to even themselves out.  Bad rolls early = DOOM!  I don't think adding extra fortune cards would do much to help the luck factor of the game.  OTOH, I really liked lots of the little changes in the game, especially multi-turn combat.

RATING: 7.5
Haven't played it yet, but some friends played it at our game night and liked it a lot.

Finally played the game solo.  I like it fairly well.  It's certainly different from classic Axis and Allies, and has a much more "wargame" feel to it.  I really like the order cards, which seem to make things run smoothly.  The Allies won my game on turn 9.    

Two things I don't like:

1.  Reinforcements will run out eventually.  This leads to my second criticism

2.  It can feel like a chess match at times, especially near the end when you have few units contesting large areas.  

I would like to try a few things differently next time I play.  Clearing out the Cherbourg penisula seems to be a must for the Allies...it's a lot harder for the Germans to get reinforcements up there, and if the Allies can clear that penisula, they can swing the rest of their units south.

For the Germans, you have to decide whether to fit to the death early or pull back, regroup, and counterattack.  Cherbourg would seem to be a lost cause against an Allied player determined to take it, but I think a delaying tactic could be fought up there.  

Lots of interesting choices.  I like the game better the more I think about it.

Axis and Allies SIMPLIFIED ... ?!!  It's not a CDG--the cards merely hold your hands through the sequence of play.  The only part of the game where there's any thinking going on is for the Allies on where to assign their fighters.  The "Advanced Game" adds barely anything, and should be used on first play by all but the most mentally challenged gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much bettter game than I expected - an excellent started Axis and Allies game for kids, due to the turn sequence being included on cards that explain each phase.  Once that phase is complete, turn the next card and do what it says.  Wish more games had that - its a great teaching tool.

The game itself is pretty fun, and supports three well, one as GE, one as US, one as UK.

A good game about Normandy 44. The card system with the phases and optional events makes game quicker and gives replayability. 

It could have better rating if it was a balanced game. I find it too difficult for Allies. OK I recon it was an heroic effort back then and blahblahblah but you don't make this point more clear by creating games some 60 years later that make D-Day look like a Mission Impossible

I have been playing Axis & Allies since the early 1980's when I purchased the first edition which was published by Nova Games. I think the system is quite good and is historically accurate enough at a strategic level.I feel that there are some serious issues when the game-system is used to replicate operational situations. The absence of a rigid front-line is ludicrous, IMHO. Also, with the basic rules, this is seriously biased towards a German victory.

A fun simple game. Came down to the very last turn in our 3 player game of old timers. This made for an enjoyable evening.  The German player thought they were getting slaughter, which they were, but they held on to the very last victory hex as the Allies did have their units in the right place. Victory conditions make the game worth the fight.  Takes about 2 to 3 hours to play.

Excellent introductory wargame. The cards dictating sequence of play (that changes as the game goes on to some extent) and simple rules make this perfect for novices, but while keeping a lot of the flavor of the historical campaign.

As a long-time Axis and Allies fan, some observations on this one:
Plus: great components and map, interesting rule twists, tactical airpower modeling seems historical, rather historical order of appearance of units.

Minus: Fortune cards can wildly swing the results - can take over a game, units lose their identity once they come off the reinforcement sheet and on to the board.

A pretty decent game, but not the best game in the AA lineup. 

Beyond the plays I've logged here at BGG, I estimate I've played this ~2 times prior to my logging of plays.

The Normandy landings, with a few mechanics borrowed from Axis and Allies.  The Allies have to push in and hold Cherbourg, Caen and St. Lo for an entire turn to win.  Sixteen phase sequence of play(!) becomes simplicity itself through an ingenious set of "turn" cards that indicate what activates when.  Semi-random reinforcement tracks, optional fortune/tactics cards, air interdiction, naval bombardments, 2-3 hour play time.  A very nice package.

It's certainly more balanced than A&A Europe, but it has a few problems of it's own. The lack of production, the predetermined reinforcements, and the narrow victory conditions mean that one game will play very much like the next. 

I do like the rules for fighter patrols interdicting enemy movement into and out of zones... nice touch, even if way too powerful ("Drat! Yet another full panzer battalion annihilated by strafing attacks!") 

This is a decent light wargame for folks looking for that sort of thing, and it does a reasonably good job of capturing the general mood and situation of the D-Day breakout. As for me, I'd much rather spend my time playing Mighty Endeavor, Breakout Normandy, or Normandy 44. 

I ended up trading this game for a copy of Britain Stands Alone.

RATING: 6
There are few nice ideas, especially the sequence-of-play cards and the reinforcement rolls, but there are some serious problems with the game. The fact that the allies need to take all three objectives to win means that the axis can ignore two of them - this is a game design gaffe of the highest order, IMO. The pinning rule is hard to justify, and strafing planes are insanely overpowered. Casualty levels are incredible - I've seen several games in which the Germans have been entirely wiped out.

RATING: 4
An A&A game without research or production, and a linear card system that tells you when to move your units and when to attack. Becomes repetitive and predictable (outside of dice rolls) and requires way too lengthy a play-time for what it is.

It is true that this game is hard to win for the Allies! Highly random (I wouldn't recommend the "Fortune" cards - they make a luck driven game even more luck driven) and only slightly challenging regarding strategy. The only sensible strategy for the Germans seems to be letting go of the western coast and defending only the two lower cities, which is in fact very easy to do: You simply push your ample reinforcements two spaces two the north, even a 6-year old can work that out... Very little to think about here, the game plays YOU, but enjoyable in a slightly immature way...
One note: Why are there so many very positive ratings here by people who admit to not actually having PLAYED the game? I wouldn't judge a game by reading the rules only...

RATING: 5
The Axis & Allies game system just doesn't adapt to this campaign well.  For one thing, there are no naval unit, and because the Allies have air supremacy over the board, there are no air units for the Germans.  The new air rules are indeed innovative and capture the nature of the campaign, but the old A&A attrition results from battles are so unrealistic as to reduce the game to little more than advanced Risk.  And it always, always comes down to the climactic battle for Caen on the last two turns of the game.

didn't care for this much since the cards were laid out in order and only fate cards lended some variability to the game.  Perhaps I didn't play it enough....but once did it for me.

The best gateway Axis and Allies in my opinion. Short, sweet, and to the point, with both sides having straightforward goals. While the rule set is different from the average large scale A&A's, that is more a blessing than a curse, as you get enough of the base mechanics that a shift to say, the Pacific, isn't that jarring, and it is less likely that new players will bounce off due to complexity.

RATING: 5
From one play, I'd rate the game out of the box as a 5, however it's hugely open to house rules and reality checks. Given that (and the variants we played) I would rate it a 7 or possibly higher. So for now, a 6.5 which I might change with repeated play. Definately a good game in there though, I enjoyed it.

I enjoy A&A, and have no problem with this type of "dicefest" game; however, the execution on this one is rather poor.  The game starts OK, but as the game draws to conclusion fewer and fewer units will be on the board until at the end you'll likely only have small patches of units huddled around St Lo, and maybe Caen (the map should have lots of units holding a solid line crossing the board to be considered somewhat historical).  

Upon first setting up the game, I got a strong deja-vu flashback from Breakout:Normandy.  The map boundaries and the type of units in each section are so similar that I'd suspect the starting situation was copied directly.

Lastly, I've found the game greatly favoring the Germans.  To win, they just need to get any unit into a VP location and survive one round of combat on turn 9.  By contesting St Lo, Caen, and Cherbourg in particular ways I don't see how it will be possible for the Allies to win.

Only one play under my belt... but I enjoyed myself a good bit. Feels like "Queen's Gambit" for WW2 fans (though that's not really a fair comparison).

UPDATE: With a couple of solo plays   another play against another gamer, my opinion is locked in. This is a good "transitional" wargame... not as strategic as A&A, but an excellent set of tactical problems for both sides with nice variability introduced with the extra card decks.

RATING: N/A
Heavily scripted, and with few meaningful options at the beginning; later, it becomes attritional and pretty narrow in scope. The railroading of play does create a decent narrative. Air power is nicely handled. The problem is that this is still Axis and Allies ... and a version of Axis and Allies that is absent the epic sweep and opportunities to explore alternate histories found in the parent game. And so you slowly, slowly plod through the game, pushing little soldiers, rolling lots of dice, and ... well, we couldn't be bothered to finish it.

D-Day is probably my least favorite A&A game.  Most of interesting decisions in other A&A games are the decisions of what to build and where to attack. A&A D-day has nether of those decisions, as you don’t build units, and there are no options as far as the victory conditions are concerned. The allied player must take all three cities to win.      Unfortunately with the lack of few tactical decisions, due to the large size of the spaces on the board, this game comes down to a simple battle of attrition.  The Germans have more forces and they most likely win.  If you are looking for a game were tactics, decide the battle this is not it.  I don’t have a problem with luck in a game, but this game just offers too few interesting decisions.  The most interesting decision in D-day is where to place your fighters.  Good for one or two plays, but sure to get boring and repetitive after that.  The A&A system simply does not seem to work well on an operational level.

Very cool A&A varient.  The card deck is basically just the sequence of play, but having the other cards that modify what happens is nice.  My games so far have all centered around a final battle for St. Lo.  Caen is usually captured early and survives a few German attempts at recapture, and Cherbourg takes a while to get to but is really too far away for German reinforcements to get to so is usually a write off.

Overall lots of fun and recommended if you're looking for a light wargame.

If any of the A&A series has a flaw of a 'winning strategy', this would come the closest.  The game is less about an overall strategy as it is about lucky dice rolls.

However, on the plus side, it does take things to a deeper level then any of the other A&A games, and the luck factors do portray a nice simple battlefield chaos effect.

I've played this a few times now (I believe only 3).  If you've played A&A this will come easier to pick up (say an hour of reading, etc), however if not, plan on spending a few hours ready and learning how to play.  The game is shorter than other A&A games as it can only last 10 rounds.  I don't like some of the mechanics such as the dice rolling for what you produce.  It's also dissapointing that the dice can control so much of the game.  It's worth a game play for those war game strategist.

For a strategy game, this one can be played in a couple of hours (without any "teaching factor" to newbies).  Since I don't have my copy of AH's D-DAY anymore (damn my parents' yard sales while I was @ college!), this is an excellent replacement to that particular classic game from a classic game board company.  I love the cards which determine the turn sequences & it's a great addition to the A&A series.  The reason for the rating of "7" is based on the fact other games in this series are better.  Still, if you're looking for a quick game to satisfy the urge for a strategy game fix it fits the bill perfectly.

RATING: 7
I've played this quite a bit now and I'm rather fond of it.  Strongly recommend either using all the expansion cards or none - the tactics cards make up for the Allies what the fortune cards cost them (using just the fortune cards will weight things too much in the Axis player's favor).  Despite the comments below, the Allies are fairly robust - the key is that you have to take risks with them and accept that every so often this will blow up in your face.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on one basic game play as the Allies.  I am sure some purists here will rate this game somewhat lower, but it acheives only what it claims to be: a lite wargame designed for theme, simplicity and fun.  The Germans have a tough time of it, they were almost totally destroyed by turn ten.  I would seem to think that the more experienced player must be the Germans to assure good balance.  Possible gamey victory conditions: because I was unable to occupy St. Lo for a *full* turn, the Germans technically won, even though they had only two units on the board.  In the future though, I expect that the Allies will never make that mistake again.  Optional cards appear to add some life to the purchase, and the game is ripe for variants, houserules and other tinkerings to suit any players' desires.  Good pieces and board.  The rules/cards might have error in text concerning reinforcements (book says one die, cards say two!) Bottom line: Give it a shot.

I was a little annoyed with the way reinforcements are added at various times, but that is a bit more realistic and gives the allied player an impetus to gain a foothold quickly. Compared to a Memoir44 Omaha Beach scenario, for instance, A&A D-Day is more detailed but I'm not sure if it's more fun than the M44 D-Day scenario. I will have to play again, as my impressions here are only after playing once.

RATING: 4
Based on one play; two-player.  The Allies won by capturing the third city, St. Lo, in Turn 9.  Interesting I suppose.  Something didn't seem right about this.  We had questions on a couple of rules and may have gotten something wrong.  But apparently we had the strafing aircraft right.  These seem way too strong.  The Allied aircraft ravaged my axis units by rolling a "one" on probably 75% of their die rolls.  In one turn it eliminated eleven of twelve reinforcement units.  For the first time I started to understand the general complaints of luck vs. die rolls.  I don't really have a desire to play this again.  Maybe I'd try it again now that I have some knowledge of how it works.  I suppose I'd try another A&A game.  But overall this play has soured me on A&A.  And the bits were too fiddly; the soldiers wouldn't even stand up.  Cardboard chits or cubes would have been far better.  Oh, and too long.

I don't like this game nearly as much as the original Axis and Allies.  There is less strategy involved since you don't buy units.  But it is nice that it can be played in a shorter amount of time, with a 10 turn limit.  And when we played it, it was down to the last dice roll of turn 9 to see who would win, which was exciting.

2-3 hour war game, kind of fun to play and there are some decisions to be made by the players.  However, it seems that the final outcome is more driven by luck than by strategy (compared to the original A&A).  If you're not a sore loser, and are okay with the possibility of losing even if you make the best possible decisions, then it's a pretty fun game to play.

From start to finish, the game plays kind of like a 15-pound bowling ball, thrown by your 6-year-old niece, and the players' try to change the course of the bowling ball by hurling billard balls at it.

Fun game that really slims down the A&A experience. No more worrying about money and factories, reinforcements come in at set points in the game, run by an event deck. You can throw in some random advanced cards to spice it up a bit once you get used to the game. Unfortunately the battles are still too random and you still get the situations where 3 infantry will take out a bunch of tanks or other ridiculous scenarios.

RATING: 4
Factoring out luck (which will generally even itself out in a game with this much die rolling), this game seems to be drastically tilted in favor of the Axis player (at least insofar as the victory conditions are concerned). As the Germans, all you have to do is have at least one unit in one of the three object cities (Caen, St.Lo or Cherbourg) at the end of turn 9 and you win. If the German player collapses most of his starting troops around Cherbourg back into Cherbourg, and then divides his reinforcements (more numerous, more powerful and better positioned than the Allies' reinforcements) between hasseling Caen and fortifying St. Lo, the Allies simply don't have a chance. We played this game twice. The first time (skipping the Fortune and Tactics cards) everyone was still formulating their stratgies and the Axis side won with one unit surviving in St. Lo. In the second game (playing with all the cards), the Allies barely took Cherbourg, were fighting a losing battle in St. Lo and were completely annihilated in Caen (not a single British unit left on the board). Great idea for a game, great pieces, easy to play, but in need of some tweaking.

I don't honestly think this game is THAT good, but I have to admit I've really enjoyed my plays of it. Even though I agree there may be some imbalance in the endgame conditions, I just love the physical production of the game, combined with some innovative (and speedy) mecanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rating of 6.5 based on 4 plays.

I don't find A&A: D-Day as fun as either A&A Revised or the A&A theater games.  To me, the system doesn't translate well  to the tactical/operational level.  Maybe it's running out of reinforcements quickly enough that it's possible to end the game a turn or two early due to there being few or no German units left sometimes, but it doesn't grab me as much as the others.  That said, there are some brilliant changes to the rules from the higher-level siblings; the Allied fighter rules, for example.  All in all, I'm usually willing to play this (and sometimes even suggest it) if there are 3 of us with a couple of hours to kill, but I'd be just as likely to suggest something else.  If there are just two of us, and we're in the mood for a light wargame, I'd usually want to go for Battle Cry or Memoir '44 instead, or possibly GEV.

An ok introductory Axis & Allies game. It holds your hand a bit too much in my opinion. Kind of forces the players into a "close" ending, when in reality, the game was orchestrating the game end all along. All in all, what you would expect from an Axis & Allies boardgame. Good, quality components as usual, and tons of historical context.

Only played twice, but my impression is positive.  Loads of fun.  Lots of dice balance eachother out.  Tactics cards add more strategy.  Fortune cards add luck.  All decisions are tactical.  Seems good for a few occasional plays, but the lack of strategy may prevent frequent play.

An utter travesty.  You would think that Hasbro, with its mountains of cash, would publish a game that had even the rudiments of a historical outcome.  Wrong.  This embarrassment exhibits not one bit of playtesting polish.  It's like they took a sniff at the Breakout:  Normandy map and order of battle (remembering that Hasbro owns the rights to BK:N), made some spiffy plastic components, tossed in some cards, and declared the thing ready for consumers.  Incredible.

I'm abig fan of the A&A series, but I'd been reading some of the negative reviews on this board and didn't break out this game until now, much later.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find a really nice introductory wargame here!  It's not as sprawling as the classic A&As, for sure, but it does do a fine job of introducing classic war game mechanics to newbies, and it's great for those folks who don't have 4-5 hours to play out an entire war.  There's still lots of dice-rolling and moving of little cool pieces around, but underlying it all is a very nice wargame, albeit on the simpler side.

Decent, quick playing, light wargame.  The best Axis & Allies game that I've played so far.  But after just one play (with the Fortune & Tactics cards), I wonder about the long-term play value of the game.  

There's only so many ways you can go after the 3 vp cities given the time restrictions.  

Anyway, an interesting twist to the A&A game system:  adaptions of the system for the Battle of the Bulge,  Stalingrad and other set-piece type WW2 battles might be interesting.

Very "dicey" as with all the A&A titles, but the "one-cycle of combat per turn" and reinforcements (rather than purchasing new units) makes this less similar to the others in this series.  The advanced rules make the game even more dynamic - giving it an "ebb and flow" that enriches a traditionally programmed family of games.

Bought for me as a Christmas prezzie in 2004. Heard it described as "Risk on Steroids" and that's not a bad description!

Simple concept, easy to pick up though the battle board and order cards seem superflous and just extend the game - we ditched the battle board on the first round and the order cards will follow once I can remember the exact game sequence.  Neat learning aid though.

As others have noted use of air power is key and if used correctly it can be devastating.

Fun, simple, easy to learn war game - I recommend ou play with all the cards - it's much more fun that way.

Played 2x now.  I like it a fair bit - it's not as freewheeling as the original A&A, but the added structure actually does a good job of running the game along at a good clip.  You're guaranteed not to spend the whole evening on this one, which is a plus.

I do find the game heavily slanted towards the Germans, though.  It feels like the Allies need supremely lucky die rolls to make it fair - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but does take the shine off the game a little.

Overall, I think it's an okay game, but I will probably choose the much more fluid and engaging Memoir '44 over it about 90% of the time.

Felt good at first...but then reality set in.  The basic game is really boring after 1 play.  The "advanced" or fortune game is badly imbalanced against the Allies...but what's worse is that play is so boring.  Each turn you move to hunt units or 1 of 3 victory areas...then roll dice.  The only "interesting play" occurs when the Allies place fighters.  The rest of the game is just push 'N dice...a simple A&A offshoot without much meat or interest...certainly not much replay value.

Perhaps my favorite campaign style A&A game and definitely in my current top 2 A&A games overall(I only rate games that I have, sorry 1940 global fans I haven't purchased those two games yet-update- just got europe '40 and pacific '40 today- comments and rating will be coming soon). D-Day is alongside 1941 an excellent gateway game to get someone into A&A. Everything is laid out and ordered on the map and in the cards, they direct what happens when and where to an extent that can easily walk the novice player through the game. After a time or two through D-Day games, the new player should be very well accustomed to A&A in general.

This game is ridiculous. The basics are not too dissimilar from standard Axis and Allies, which means that the whole thing comes down to a massive dicefest. True, A&A isn't as bad as Risk in this regard, but it still does get really old when you are mostly just rolling dice constantly.

What makes this game absolutely horrendous are the stupid orders cards. Whereas I could just read a sequence of play and just play the game, I have to sit there and flip over all these stupid cards and look to see what's next: this is nothing but a gimmick and only serves to make play tedious and draws the game out in length. The fortune cards are truly an exercise in tedium, since on a roll of 2-5 nothing happens anyway. You end up reading the card, figuring out what happens or what it means, then nothing happens anyway.

This game has about as much to do with D-Day as the Adams Family has to do with the Munsters. The pieces are mediocre in terms of sculpting and quality, the map is not anything to write home about, the game play is incapable of simulating the Overloard campaign in any real way, and strategy is really not relevant as compared to random dumb luck. The cards, rather than add anything to the game, actually detract fom the game (you are better off playing without them), and the whole game basically comes down to a war of attrition. There's little redemption for this game as I see it, and so I am being generous by giving it a "4". Only because it doesn't have any serious errata do I give it anything more than a '3'.

RATING: 2
nice idea, but everything in this game is dice driven. There's no real player input here. You fail or win this game by the dice. The only merit of this game is to go and play it on the beaches of normandy and get a history kick out of it.

This is actually my favorite of the four game series (excluding Miniatures). I enjoy it because of the simple format and quick turns. One of my favorite games was when I was the Allies and lost by one turn as one of my buddy's had one unit left on the entire board, sitting in St. Lo. Since that time I have directed many British troops towards that area after securing Caen. Since that little change in strategy, the Allies have seen more success than not. Game is in excellent condition.

RATING: 6.5
Played this game as I have most in the A&A series. While it has the A&A name the game is very different. It uses 16 scripted orders cards to complete a turn. While I do like this aspect, it is just not enough. While the game is fun, it really lacks the long range economic/building phases of the original A&A. Since all units are pre-determined (as in what was there on D-Day), you just never get to vary your strategy too much. The game is FUN the first few plays and is great to look at, but after a few games I just wanted more. If you want a fast invasion of France (and I do some times) this game is worth playing. If you want a good tense war game then look elsewhere.

While not being a big fan of the larger A&A games...   This one is great fun.  Being much shorter and much more forgiving on a horrible luck, this game has been a craps shoot down to the last turn nearly every time I have played it.  I love the car mechanics for the rounds, and find that the Tactics cards are vital, while the fate cards should be torn up and thrown away straight out of the box.

I thought this one was a good game....kind of surprised at the low ratings.  It is really hard for the allies to win, but isn't that the way it was in real life?  I've played the allies a few times and only won one time.  I had to be more aggressive than I would normally be with other games, plus, a little luck with the dice helped me out also.  Those two combinations (aggressiveness and a lil luck of the roll) will spell victory for the allies.....hmmmm, sounds familiar doesn't it?  Oh yeah, I believe that is what happened in real life!  There is no doubt that the advantage is the Germans and its the allies job to WIN the game, where the Germans simply have to play not to LOSE.  Anyway, this is really a fun game and, I feel, really captures the essence of D-Day for the allies.  Also, I feel that it should speak volumes of how well the allies performed in real life because in this game, we can all see how the chips were really stacked against them! Bravo on the game!  I would normally rate this game an 8 on content....however, due to some of the stupid reasons I've seen people have given to give this game a bad rating, I have decided to bump it up to a 9.

I'm a big fan of the original A & A. This game has some of the mechanics of that game, but very little else.

It's a decent beginner's war game, but has little replay value and very little variance in strategy and tactics. 

That doesn't mean you can't make meaningful decisions, because you can. It just means that the decisions can be limited at times.

I don't think I'd play it again. I think there's a few other games that would be a better experience that are shorter and less scripted.

D-Day is the most tactical of the A+A series and a card deck is required to maintain the flow of 20+ steps each round.  It is painfully repetitive.  Since there is minimal strategic capability, D-Day nicely levels the playing field for players of unequal experience.  A newbie child could play this with a grognard dad and still have fun.  The grognard dad won't.

RATING: 8
Easily the best game to introduce other players to axis and allies.    The card system is clear on who and what action must take place so new players don’t feel overwhelmed with choices of purchasing what unit should where to deploy where to move where to attack.  

D day is very balanced and plays in around 2 hours for the simple version and 3 hours when you add in the extra tactical cards.


As for replay 

The game can get a bit stale after 3/4 plays if your not using the advanced cards.   Throw in the advanced cards and watch your plans get shatttered l, boosted or the best a new opportunity opens up and you get that killer shock and awe play pulled off.


Overall great game for new or expierenced axis and allies players

One player controls Germany, whose Axis forces have turned the beaches of Normandy into a near-impenetrable stronghold. Set to breach those defenses are the Allies: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The future of Europe and the world hangs in the balance.

RATING: 10
t’s the morning of June 6, 1944. As Allied forces prepare to storm Normandy’s beaches, the fate of Europe is in your hands! In honor of next year’s 60th anniversary of D-Day, Avalon Hill will release Axis & Allies D-Day, a new, stand-alone extension of the classic strategy game Axis & Allies. Axis & Allies D-Day will allow players to recreate the largest amphibious invasion in history.

Axis & Allies D-Day features detailed game components including a new blockhouse piece, an extra-large game board, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the D-Day game box. Other elements of this new Axis & Allies variant include a card deck with three card types -- Orders, Tactics, and Fortune -- to add depth and complexity to play. Order cards determine play sequence and break turns into distinct phases; Tactics cards offer players varied strategic opportunities; and Fortune cards add an element of unpredictability.

Axis & Allies D-Day begins as Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-held Normandy, is underway -- 130,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are poised to assault Fortress Europe. You and your fellow world powers control their fates.

One player controls Germany, whose Axis forces have turned the beaches of Normandy into a near-impenetrable stronghold. Set to breach those defenses are the Allies: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The future of Europe and the world hangs in the balance.

Axis & Allies D-Day is designed for two or three players and can be played in two hours. Axis & Allies D-Day is the third Axis & Allies variant, following the successful Axis & Allies Europe and Axis & Allies Pacific, both of which were published in 2001.

I bought this with the intent of playing on the 65th anniversary of the D-Day landings, but, fate intervened and that did not take place. We've attempted to play a few times since then, unfortunately the furthest we've ever gotten was the set up and the start of the first turn before something that was more pressing occurred. Then the game was halted and put away for 'later'. One day it'll happen. That day was June 18th, 2016 when I got in 2 games, the first as the Germans and the second as the Allies. Both games were German victories.

D-Day is an an interesting take on the classic Axis and Allies formula. The whole game plays out like a computer tutorial, with every phase of the game turn printed on a unique card. These cards are then stacked in a fixed order to form an action deck. Turns then progress by flipping over each card one at a time and then carrying out its instructions. After progressing through all 10 cards, the deck is recycled and you start a new turn and do it all over again.

The game does a nice job of approximating the Battle of Normandy. As the Allies, you have to try and overwhelm the beach with sheer numbers, while watching your troops die in droves. The Germans typically just have to fall back and hang on, attempting to outlast the onslaught. While the game portrays this well, it also leaves a lot to be desired strategically. Every match plays out the same way; The Germans have to cause as much damage as possible in the first couple of turns and then fall back to the victory cities and turtle. There are simply not a lot of options, for either side.

All in all, this game is a great introduction to the Axis and Allies family and it really is fun the first couple of times you play. It just doesn't have any legs, so you'll probably get bored with it after five or six plays...but still, it's well worth having as a gateway wargame.

This is Axis & Allies only in a marketing sense; it's quite original.  More angst than traditional A&A, because of tighter constraints.  Also, and somewhat necessarily, there is less replayability, but there's plenty here for many games.  More interesting to play the Axis, but not too much so.  Feels very balanced, which is no mean feat considering the asymmetry (which is a great part of the appeal).

However, I strongly feel there should've been multiple strategic paths, such as choosing two of three objectives (or something along those lines). This would've enhanced replayability and increased depth.

RATING: 7
intresting departure for the axis and allies clan in that it  deals with a much tighter conflict than its more universal forebears, instead of whole theatres the game deals with just the normandy invasion (kinda obvious from the title huh?) pieces represent instead of corps, armies and airfleets; regiments, squadrons and companysplay is driven by a sereis of 16 cards (with an option on luck and tactics cards which take the possibilities of freak occurances into account) personally I wouldnt play without all 3 types of cards (though they do slow the game some) the cards make for an intresting game experience which may confuse A&A veterens at first but i do like, i hope eth forth coming A&A battle of teh bulge uses a similar system

The best of the A&A variants.  You have to be very careful with your tactics and use your air support/defence wisely as it can make or break the game.  The limited turns, and specific winning conditions make it a game that can easily be played in 2 hours.  I also like that you can make the game more complicated as you go along.

Wow.  Nice variant on the A&A system.  Here's to hoping they make A&A: The Ardennes.  The fortune & tactic card system really make this game.

more dice, dice, dice. but at least not hung up on being a risk upgrade. on the down side, the Germans seem to win every game I've seen or played.

Its good for getting people interested in wargames.  

"The pieces don't maneuver very far and there is not much for the brain to do.  Are you really playing the game, or is the game really playing you?"

Missing two pieces and had extra Axis trooper when bought. Company quickly replaced it. A great game that tends to heavily favour the Axis.

It appears to have come with one less German blockhouse, but has a Risk cannon in it's place.  Box has very slight wear (whitening of corners)

Another one found at the Mission Thrift in Memphis for $1.00.  Missing a few pieces.  Will play it down the road.

In my opinion, this is a more serious version of Memoir 44 with only one scenario. Best with 2 players and not three.

It's the morning of June 6, 1944. As Allied forces prepare to storm Normandy's beaches, the fate of Europe is in your hands! One player controls Germany, whose Axis forces have turned the beaches of Normandy into a near-impenetrable stronghold. Set to breach those defenses are the Allies: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The future of Europe and the world hangs in the balance.

Fast-playing, interactive game.  Excellent adaptation of the Axis and Allies system.  My 8-year-old loves it.

10/29/10:  Gets a little too repetitive with multiple plays.

I think that this is the easiest Axis & Allies game to get into.  Only played if a few times so far, but it seems fairly well balanced.

Many memories playing this game, but there are far better options now a days, and I'll never play it again.

A little lengthy for what it is.  Interesting for A&A, but the balance is lacking.

Pleasantly surprised. Great production, easy to teach and still offers plenty of strategy and decision making. The variable events help make every game unique.

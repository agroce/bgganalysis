GAME: HeroQuest
RANK: 550
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play of the first (basic) scenario. Definately need to play more.

The funny thing is that my daughters (aged 3 and 5) were the adventurers and had a great time.  They did call the figures 'dolls' and insisted on replacing the adventurer figures with:
a girl figurine
a small polar bear
a toy car, which was later replaced by a dog with a train

I played all of them as Barbarians.

Found a used copy in my recent travels. Box is in rough shape but the price was reasonable and every piece is there. The white dice are fairly worn down as are the 'open' doors and 2 of the tables but I have nice sturdy plastic Mage Knight doors and tables for proxy. Nice find!

My friend just gave me an incomplete copy he'd had for awhile.  I have good memories of this one, but will have to give it a shot.  I've had great fun with Dragonstrike by making up my own rules as a DM--not sure if Heroquest would support that as much.  

Got a chance to play this some more at Origins 2009 on a loving fan's copy--reminded me how great it was!

It does what Descent doesn't, even if it is simpler.

Loved this game as a child. I have spent the last couple of months restoring the base game plus three expansions - painting, reconstructing, and printing/laminating replacements for lost tiles. The first game was promising, but we only covered the first (very simple scenario). It's extremely nostalgic, and the spells are amusing. I enjoyed it.

Simple dungeon crawler played only for nostalgic reasons. Modern crawlers (e.g. Doom, Descent, Imperial Assault) offer a deeper experience. However, when it comes to setting the map up, HeroQuest beats those games 10-0. This is something that should not be underestimated. A game that is supposed to play fast should setup fast, too.

Great fantasy-themed light role-playing game suitable for a younger audience.  I'll still pull it out occasionally for a dungeon-crawler that doesn't take the 8 hours that a game of Descent would.

More enjoyable before the heroes figure out how to exploit a bottlenecking strategy to cripple a room full of even the fiercest of monsters.

First dungeon crawl game I've tried. I loved the theme, the figures and the cards as a child. Sadly, I didn't really understood the combat system back then. I remember, that none of us kids wanted to be the game master...

RATING: 6
For the standard game itself and its original rules I only give it a rating of 6. BUT the game is a real good base for developing your own szenarios and create new heroes and monsters. If you take this chance and play by the custom stuff found on several websites you have a decent game. The only problem is that you actually need a lot of time to create this custom szenario and therefore this game isnt perfect for non-regular gaming groups.

RATING: N/A
Played this quite a bit as far as I remember.  I hope that they re-issue Advanced Heroquest, if that was the one where you played against the board.  Or was that Warhammer Quest?  ARGH!

Whatever, it's going back to its original owner, I think.

RATING: 3
Boy was this game a disappointment. I used to be a role-playing fan, so I thought that this is the right thing for me. But no, it is just painfully boring. Go in a room, slay the monsters, grab the treasure, that's it.
I ended up using the material to visualize situations in our role plays.

THEMATIC

This was a childhood favorite. As heroes, explore dungeons in this fantasy world.  I loved the ability to create one's own levels. I also owned the two expansion packs.

Maggie found a used copy on eBay and purchased it for our anniversary! I also recently acquired a like-new copy via Craigslist. My third copy was acquired from a friend, who moved.

Recommended with 2-5 players (best 5). 90 mins.

RATING: 8.5
Well, for me this game provided a fantastic experience, but rather personal and not easily reproducible. It was played during a period of over 3 years with my wife and sons ,really young at the time, and a nephew a few years older than my oldest son. I was our First tabletop RPG. Were I to judge my experience, and my experience only, this game would be an eleven, but even though this is not a review but a log of my impressions, I'm trying to be impartial. It's a simple solid game where the limited number of actions meke it ideal to introduce to new players. Great production level, specially considering it is from 1989, and even in the brazilian edition the components were good. Nostalgia level going through the roof.

I had to give this a high rating if nothing else for nostalgia. Definitely my first board game with many, many replays, and I still have two copies with two expansions from my childhood (I painted all the figures as well). Though after a few contemporary replays of the game, I feel the game lacks on some elements, I still consider it a cornerstone of my foundation in fantasy gaming. If nothing else, the ability to create your own missions is worth the purchase (if you can find an affordable copy). Would love to see an updated remake.

Los nacidos en los primeros 80 podríamos clasificarnos como los que tuvieron un Hero Quest y los que siempre quisieron tenerlo (como mi caso), no se de nadie que no haya jugado o visto jugar nunca a este juego en los 90. En su momento nos parecía un juego de enormes posibilidades, muy muy bien presentado con miniaturas y escenografía de todo tipo. A muchos nos sirvió para introducirnos en el mundo medieval-fantástico, aunque a día de hoy pues es un juego muy limitado, fantásticamente ambientado pero muy limitado. De hecho una vez acabado el libro de retos (misiones), pues el juego se acababa prácticamente a no ser que alguien diseñara nuevos escenarios... Hoy me haría con uno por puro  romanticismo, pero dudo que viera nunca la mesa...

RATING: 5
The first fantasy game that I ever played. Amazing production values for its time. Its a cool dungeon crawler game. We had a great time playing this at summers when we were kids. But putting nostalgia issues away, time has not been kind to Heroquest. The mechanics really feel outdated by today's standards. The roll and move mechanic is awfull and all the monsters have 1 hit point! The game is also very unbalanced in favour of the heroes. 
So I cant really recomment this game to anyone. If you are looking for an easy to teach and fast to play dungeon crawler game, better look elsewhere.

Kill me now.  Oh, wait, I'm dead.
Played as 2-player game; 1 player had 4 roles, the other was the DM.  Much nicer than if each player had only one role, too much down-time.  Also very boring if your role is killed quickly.  So basically, boring.  And it sucks.

Some people would rather play D&D rather then this, and normally I'd agree with them. Other times, some people think that their female elven druid shouldn't have to spend 300 golds on a masterwork quarterstaff. "It's just a stick!" they'd say, and maybe they might even illustrate it by actually picking up a stick on the walk home. "How does a stick cost the same amount for a  1 bonus to hit, the same as a frickin' flail (or broadsword)" and I'd shrug my shoulders and point to the rules. They're there for our own good. But noooooo this would be such a point of contention that they wouldn't shut up about it. Names are called, tables are tossed, and even though they swear it's because you're a terrible DM as a whole, you know their just bitter about the whole stick thing. It would be years later that I would discover that in fact, a masterwork quarterstaff doesn't cost 300 golds, like a flail and a broadsword. It costs 600 golds. Oh, and searching in this game is pretty dumb.

Ah, one of the first games I actually owned.  My father owned a comic and card shop and he accepted this game in trade for store credit.  What was special you may ask?  Well, every single figure was painted in INCREDIBLE detail.  I still remember what every figure looked like and they were painted amazingly well.  If only I still had this game, it wasn't as fun as newer dungeon crawl board games, but it was my first and it was fun then!

Here's a game I really liked it as a kid.  Playing it again as an adult...still pretty fun.  The miniatures are obnoxious, easily moved around and constantly getting in the way.

Played this once as a kid. Can't remember if I liked it, but I think I did. Had the game on my mind ever since at least, and when I got into board gaming this game was number one on my wishlist. My sisters got me this for Christmas. I'm very much looking forward to playing it again.

I love this game.  Heroquest was my first dungeon crawler, and it will always have a special place in my heart.   It was very innovative for its time and it has great replayability.  Heroquest also has some of the best components I've ever seen in a board game.

The game does have serious balance issues; heroes are easily killed in the early quests and invicible by the end of the game.  Also, the wizard character never really progresses much, since he has limited equipment to buy.

A great pen and paper alternative. This doesn't offer the freedom and customization of Dragon Strike, but you can't beat how easy it is to pick up and play. You'll need only a fraction of the rule-reading time required by other D&D "campaign-in-a-box" games.

RATING: 6.5
This was my first "advanced" boardgame (now calling it advanced sounds funny...) when I was a teen. It was MY gateway game so it deserves a special place in my heart.

Gameplay is pretty basic for today's standards: overlord vs heroes, heroes move and perform an action (or vice versa), dice-based combat with special dice. Sounds like an FFG game, right? But Heroquest was released in 1989, when FFG wasn't even founded!

The component quality is so high it' unbelievable this game is almost 25 years old! GW miniatures are awesome, but the furniture is way beyond anything you can find in a contemporary (2010+) game.

The base game provides 14 scenarios, linked in a campaign.

Can't wait to play this with my daughters! I will soon head towards Nostalgia Boulevard...

RATING: 5
Quite a good d12 based RPG.  The rules were, however, less than clear in parts and needed cleaning up.

With a decent amount of support this may have rivalled D&D and other RPG's (specially since it included minis) but the fuzziness of the rules, price of the boxed sets and lack of support from the publisher killed the whole heroquest family.

And, of course, GW set sail for greener pastures sucking lots of money out of young kids (and some not quite grown-up twenty-somethings) with Warhammer (both fantasy and 40K).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First game I ever really truly appreciated. Great game that kept it simple, had supplements, and provided hours of great fun. Replayability was a little thin, unless you created your own dungeons. I have'nt played it in a long time, but I'm sure it bring back some fond memories and pleasantly "kill" an evening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I am not an RPG player, and I haven't actually played this game since I was probably eight years old, having just dug it out of my parents' attic. Nevertheless, I've given it a decent rating based on what I remember of the game, and how important a role it helped fill in the time it was released, bridging the gap between regular games and more advanced (ie, role playing) games for geeky kids everywhere. I imagine this rating will change once I decide to try it out again when my sons are old enough to try it out. The only question is whether my opinion of the game will be higher or lower.

Fun but the bad guys die way to easy I suggest using a variant to make it a little harder for the hero as a one hit kill is just dumb.

The original dungeon crawler that Descent and all the others are based on. Revoloutionary back in the 80's. Gorgeous 3d props: tables, racks, bookshelves, chests, fireplaces etc. Very basic gameplay, hard to win as the game master when heros have levelled up from previous games.

If someone asks you which is the fantasy game to start with, you can easily answr: "Hero Quest"! This is the fantasy board game everyone knows, because all the board gamers started with it: simple, plain, vintage, and with great advantage of adding you own rules. Long life to Hero Quest!

A good game, but it ain't got shit on Advanced Heroquest by GW.  The best part of this game was the minis that could be used with AHQ, as well as the furnishings.

it all started for me with this...Whenever I see one copy on a flea market, I cannot leave such a precious behind.
I first played this game at school in some kind of working group and thought "wow". After some time I wondered whether there are any other games similar to this (I had no idea how many games are out there). So this game must have made me a geek...
I own of course the german version.

Reviews are always personal. Unless theyre paid for. But with a game thats now 28 years old (when is that 25th anniversary version coming out...) theres no way reviews are anything other than personal. And deeply personal as in, tied to childhood memories, so biased in the extreme!
I love HeroQuest. The classic dungeon crawling, high fantasy theme is my absolute favourite. I cant get enough of it it seems and it's remained a constant theme in my favourite films, books, TV and yes, modern board games. Any games that are like HQ or inspired by it I tend to buy and enjoy, Descent, Warhammer quest, new and old, Z:BP,  Monoliths Conan to name a few, Ive really enjoyed them all immensely aswell in their own ways, but HQ is always my first love. And I will continue to buy games in the same vein, backing kickstarters in search of that initial buzz (Massive darkness, swords and sorcery anyone?) and like the proverbial junkie I'll likely never get that same 'hit' as the first one. But unlike the junkie I can go back to my first time and play it again and again. Less these days than I used to but one advantage of old age is you forget stuff, so sometimes it really is like the first time!
Great game, brilliant components, awesome add ons and extra campaigns. It is my life's goal to one day own all of the add ons!

One of the greates gaming memories from my childhood. We used to play this two-player, me as the adventurers and my friend as the GM/keeper/Morcar. And even if all my characters were killed in one scenario, we just continue dto the next, so it became quite hard in the end without character development. Then at highschool another friend bought a very used copy of this and I got to play again. It was still so much fun, even though the challenge wasn't that hard anymore. This has probably affect me becoming a roleplayer more than any other game.

Complete, about ~90% unpunched. Only two pieces of furniture taken out of the plastic meshes. 3/4 hero cards punched out of cardboard. And the DM screen is punched out. Everything else is still in original plastic wires, or original cardboard sheets. Dice still in plastic bag. Hero sheets completely unwritten on. Box is in good condition. Some creasing here/there. No holes/no tape. Just 20+ years old. This is probably about as pristine/unplayed copy as you can find short of removing the wrapper yourself.

Nice introductory miniatures game. Has just enough depth for gamers to enjoy and is still easy to learn for newbies. Looks great!

Played recently after a very long hiatus. Game still retains some of its simple charm. But at the same time the game feels utterly dated. This was a cool concept in the 80's but it sure as hell isn't anymore in the 21st century. Even the character abilities make no sense whatsoever. A dwarf removing traps and walking just as fast as a nimble elf?! But taking all this into account I can't deny I still had a good time playing it again.

The old dungeon crawl classic, Heroquest only requires one thing to be enjoyed still now: nostalgia. Those who played it when it was first published in the 80s - likely as teenagers - are likely keeping fond memories about those years they wish to share or recollect. Playing Heroquest kind of brings them back: it’s like rejuvenating for a short while.

If you missed that experience though it’s very likely you won’t stand Heroquest at all, as the way it plays is pretty rough. [i](July 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Over the years I’ve grown tired of most dungeon crawls: I’m still attracted to them by their mere theme - as an old roleplayer, I’m quite fond of dungeoning - but the way they play bothers me, as everything boils down to rolling a few dice and checking whether a special power activates or not. What’s still worse though is, they have the bad habit of crawling way too slow and turning into long, endless sessions of repeating the same few actions over and over.

This is why during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from an over-enthusiastic 8 to a more realistic 5.

Probably wouldn't rate it that highly if it came out now, but we got a huge number of hours of pleasure from this game.  My wife and I went through the basic game, then bought the two expansions.

Also on our honeymoon in Callendar, Scotland (geek!) I remember my adventure ending with some sort of magical mist that I couldn't stop.  I was not happy!

I remember it being at least 99% complete, sans a door and another cardboard piece. ALL: CARDS, LOOT, ENCOUNTERs, SPELLS, etc. Been a while but def did inventory and was 99%.

For trade only. Make offer, will most likely go below current value.

I love this game it has everything. It has great figs, great components, easy combat, just enough tactics and a way to make your own adventures. This is one of the best boardgames i've every played period. Most of this review is remembering when i was 9 opening and playing the game with my brothers, that was such a good time.

The kid in me wants to rate this a 10! Some of my best childhood memories are of playing Heroquest with my brother.

My brother used to own this (plus all 4 american expansions) but traded it all away for some Star Trek CCG cards back in 1994 or '95. At the time it seemed like a good trade, but looking back, both my brother and I (for not stopping him) deserve to be severely beaten for that transgression.

RATING: 8
10x10 2014. I still love this game.  Simple, but pure, dungeon crawl board game.  The quests are cool and varied.  Great atmosphere, art, and production values especially for when it was released- the furniture is so cool and the whole thing has a fantastic retro fantasy vibe..  The expansions add a lot to it too.  I love Descent too and it is the kind-of replacement for this as it's the modern day dungeon crawl board game but they really don't feel that similar to me.  Descent is more interesting and is a more competitive tactical game.  HeroQuest is lighter and overall less interesting, but what it does have over Descent is a great sense of exploration and discovery that I've rarely (never?) seen in board games.  It's just so great to look down that hall or open that door and see what the GM puts down and great fun for the GM in my experience also.

The board game that started it all for me.  I still remember opening a door for the first time and seeing 3 skeletons and debating how I was going to enter the room and defeat them.  I own Kellar's Keep, Return of the Witch Lord, Elf Quest Pack, and Barbarian Quest Pack.  I remember creating a 10 quest campaign using all 4 expansions and playing through it with my college friends.  The box is now in horrible condition, the cards are warped, and the skulls and shields have almost rubbed off all the dice.  Oh, nostalgia...

Rating of 6.5 is based on a few in-person plays and a lot of Vassal plays.  Good fun, and perhaps Vassal the best way to play (for me at least) -- no need to set up / put away the game.  Best played in 90-minute chunks.  Can drag if you don't set a time limit.

Very tough game to rate because of the fond memories from the childhood and the fact that this is an old game with old game concepts which are a bit outdated.

When you're looking for a simple, fast forward game HeroQuest if a good choice but if you're more into depth and cool gameplay you should really look into Decent like games.

Oh boy. This is true nostalgia for me. HeroQuest is without a doubt the game I have been playing the most times! I grew up with this game and it was also the one that got me in to board gaming.

I have tried it in my adult years, and the best part is the nostalgia. It is almost impossible for the heroes to lose, which is why it may be a great kid's game. I'm really looking forward to introduce this to my son, when he grows up.

Hero Quest!  The one that introduced me to it all!  I still have my copy from when I was a kid, and I later purchased a second copy with the intention of having EPIC gaming sessions.  Yes, I have TWO copies!  The game is so impressive in its scope and design, that I was recently called upon to host a small session...

...And promptly quit after halfway through to moans and groans.  Plainly put, the game is old.  Its rules, when played as written, FEEL old.  The mechanics are in sore need of an update.  Thankfully, Hero Quest is a blank slate.  It excels when house rules are employed, and desiging your own campaign/scenarios is a delight!

I may break it out again someday...  and I'll give the game a decent score, just because it was the introduction to something greater.

Good game, I played this when i was young and have a lot of fond memories. Now I play it with my family from time to time and it's a good adventure game where you can play one mission and then pick up where you left off another day or replay a mission if everyone died.

Based on 1 play with 3 players: I wish I had known about this game when I was a kid. I would have loved it then. Nowadays, though, I'm pretty sure Descent has ruined me on the dungeon crawler genre. It's neat to see where a lot of the ideas for modern dungeon crawlers came from... but I don't see a lot of reason to play this when I could play Descent instead. It just takes everything from this game and does it better.

Bad ass game of men with big muscles and bigger swords killing assorted fantasy creatures. This game marked the first time I ever heard the word "orc". Certain level of nostalgia clouds my score. The bottom line is this game is fine and lots of fun, teaches the basics of every RPG ever made (system of upgrades and rewards, etc.), but at times can be unforgiving in its difficulty and its length. Begs, no, screams for expansion, yet the core game comes with only a single blank map for personal quest design. Two were made officially, thousands more sprang from the minds of geeks across the world. If you had this one back in the day, pat yourself on the back.

Ο πρόδρομος των σημερινών ηλεκτρονικών RPG (φοβερές ομοιότητες με το Diablo 1), αποτελεί ένα συγκλονιστικό παιχνίδι για μία καλή παρέα από ορεξάτους ήρωες και για δημιουργικούς DM.
Το παιχνίδι έχει βγει σε 2 εκδόσεις, την αμερικανική και την βρετανική (οι υπόλοιπες είναι πιστές μεταφράσεις της 2ης), με κάποιες βασικές διαφορές μεταξύ τους, έχει 6 επίσημα expansions και έχουν κυκλοφορήσει στο διαδίκτυο δεκάδες ανεπίσημα quests και παραλλαγές του βασικού παιχνιδιού (rules, armories, alchemist's shops κτλ), διαθέσιμες στη φαντασία των ..Αρχόντων των Μπουντρουμιών (DM)!! Παίζεται καλύτερα σε συνέχειες από ίδιους παίκτες-ήρωες (οι οποίοι αναβαθμίζονται συνεχώς με νέα όπλα, πανοπλίες, ξόρκια κτλ), με μέση διάρκεια ανα quest περίπου 2 ώρες, ανάλογα με την εμπειρία των παικτών και του DM.
Ένα παιχνίδι φτιαγμένο με περιορισμένες σχετικά επιλογές για τους παίκτες (συγκριτικά με παιχνίδια τύπου D&D), αλλά με απεριόριστες δυνατότητες τροποποίησης στα χέρια ενός καλού DM, συν το ότι είναι πιο προσιτό από το παραπάνω λόγω χρόνου, πολυπλοκότητας κτλ.

Apparently DungeonQuest came first, but to me this is the original dungeon-crawling board-game. It's only downside is that it is too simplistic (e.g., no ranged or special attacks), but that's because it was designed for ages 8+. Loved it so much, but my friends weren't quite as interested.

A really excellent game to play with your kids.  Very much a Descent-"lite" with Heroscape's combat engine.

Rating is based on play with children, I wouldn't recommend for serious adult gamers.  

Edit, downgrading for boredom.  Combat too simple, most enemies have one hit point.  I actually am starting to cringe everytime a battle comes up.  I really don't want to play this anymore.  I'd trade it, but heck I pained all the figures!  Also, we (sons and I) played all the base game missions and most of one of the expansions before I burned out, so we got our money's worth.

A light, but amusing quasi-rpg dungeon crawl. The plastic miniatures are of decent quality, and can be used with the Warhammer Fantasy Battles tabletop game. The only problem (at least with my group) is that they prefer cooperative games, or games between evenly numbered sides - perhaps for the social (or commiseration) aspects.

This is the game that brought me in to the hobby. I will always love this game. I still push to get it on the table every so often, but Descent has taken over as the dungeon crawler of choice. Sometimes I just long for the simplicity of the Hero Quest system. In the base game things tend to get too easy for the heroes. The expansions add a good challenge, and the flexibility of the system makes it easy to make your own quests and campaigns. I have made new characters, new spells, and new monsters. My hope is that I can find a group of Hero Questers soon and get back to some old fashioned butt kicking. (40+ plays)

HeroQuest falls into the same category as Talisman: a game I grew up with, but have sort of grown a bit out of as my level increased. Nostalgia is the main reason to play this, as it helps to overlook the simplicity and lack of those modern enhancements that we feel are practically mandatory now. If you really want an updated HeroQuest experience, check out Descent first edition. If you want a HeroQuest experience that more closely resembles D&D, try the current, superior Descent second edition. Other games in the same mold are Level 7 Omega Protocol and Last Night on Earth.

I spent way more on this than it's probably actually worth, but something just called to me to pick this up when I saw it on craigslist. I have no idea how well this will play, but it's a relic of board gaming's past. It feels good to have it. I bet if 90s Dave had acquired this somehow, he would have loved it to pieces.

HeroQuest, you broke my teen-aged heart back in the day. I played you and fled back to my AD&D books. Why couldn't you be more true?

I suppose the truly interesting and authentic part of you had to be sacrificed so you could sit on the shelf at Toys R Us.

This is a great little game. Its a bit dated, and mostly has been replaced by video games....but for a light and highly thematic dungeon crawl, its well done. 

The ideal situation here is to play it as a campaign with a multi-generational game group (like Dad with the kids).  I think an all adult group would probably find it a bit thin, but may still have fun with it.

RATING: 4
D&D Dungeon Crawl Lite. Some fun to be had for younger players, but this would bore me to tears now.

When it was originally released this was notable mainly for the huge number of plastic models, the serviceable furniture / scenery pieces, and the nice RPG feel without the heavy overhead.

When I was younger, I owned this and all of the American expansions, and frequently used it in place of actual RPG games like AD&D 2nd for players who were not as interested in the full RPG experience. So, if you're getting this for the 12 year old set, then yes, I can see it.

However, the game has some problems, the game has a certain formulaic "traps, treasures, secret doors" request list that players will rattle off in any given locale, and the monsters are grossly underpowered. For the most part, the game is an excuse to go off on an adventure and to have an experience, so people who are after that will probably not find these things major problems, but personally, I find them problematic.

I think the bottom line is that HeroQuest is a passable dungeon-crawl with a board type experience, but I never found dungeon crawls particularly compelling. An occasional and storied part of RPGs in general? Sure. But that's not what I played RPGs for, and I don't think a dungeon crawl, in and of itself, is enough to sustain a game, even if the system is good, and the system here is simple and the difficulty level is set to easy. So it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's nostalgia, yes, but the overly simplistic structure with a weird hidden object system lessens any extra depth this game could have. To be fair, I've only ever played with one other person, so it might be in the same category as Dark Souls TBG where if you have a full table, it's incredibly fun, but the minimum player amount is less than amazing.
I do enjoy the diversity of some of the elf/mage spells even though one or two aren't very useful. The art on the cards is nostalgic, and there are some nice touches that were added such as that insert where the armory equipment is listed. 
The level layout is okay. I mean, it leaves plenty of room for furniture customization and item placement, and you can see that real thematic care went into object/furniture placement.
All in all, I'd rather play DOOM if I have to choose an asymmetrical board game, but it's definitely not a bad game by any stretch. For 1989, I'll cut 'em some slack. It's just not something I think I'll be playing again.

Another game from my youth.

It was amazing.  I loved this game.  Though, I always had to play Zargon since I owned it, and read all the rules.  Even when my parents played, I played Zargon, since neither of them bothered to read the rules.  They just relied on me. 
Lazy pricks.

Anyways, I don't really play it anymore, but still own it.

I did break it out to introduce my spouse to the world of board gaming.  (other then risk or monopoly)  
She like Champions of Norrath (a playstation 2 game), and enjoyed this game.
(I had painted all the figures)

Then Descent: Journey into the Dark came and took over for the game to play.

Still, I am going to be playing this with my kids, as it's rules are much more simple then Descent.

And after many fun adventures, when they feel ready, I'll inroduce them to Descent.  Until then, it'll still be a fun game for them.

Simple, story adventure, gold, magic items, dangers and decision making.
I believe I'll be playing Zargon once again.

We played this once or twice as teens (usually because someone didn't finish their D&D adventure in time), and it satisfied the fantasy addiction well enough.  Advanced Heroquest looks better, but now we have Descent.

Jan 2013 - Descent is long gone. I have Heroquest again. Have to try it. 

March 2017 - Did finally play it. It's boring but not slow-going at least. The kids LOVED it. That's what counts. Minis are super cool too.

The classic dungeon crawl boardgame.  One player is the gamemaster, throwing hordes of monsters at the four adventurers.

This is most satisfying when playing a long series of quests and building up a really good character: I wouldn't be interested in playing just one adventure, really.

This game was Dungeons and Dragons dumbed down for younger kids.  The problem is that younger kids won't get it.  We recieved it and didn't touch it for almost 5 years!  Then we found it dusty in a back closet and decided to try it out, but yet still did not enjoy it.

The advantages of being a dungeon master in DnD do not exist in this game.  You simply do as you are told.  The problem is that a tween is not going to be able to juggle this monster of a board game for him/herself and friends.  It is simply too much.

So you need to drag an older person in to run the games for you.  If you do that, you might as well buy DnD proper.

While a valient effort, it was misguided from the start.

I got this game for my tenth birthday in 1992 and loved it.  I dusted it off in 2010 and played it with my play group.  I am happy to say that it held up rather well!  The 4 characters (barbarian, elf, dwarf, and wizard) play and feel different from each other.  The way the miniatures hit the board and dungeon is revealed as you explore is a lot of fun.  There is a lot of tension and excitement when you open a door to find the huge axe of a chaos warrior right in your face!

Dropped from a 9 down to a 7.  The newer games in this genre do pretty much everything better.  Leveling up, loot, and combat are all better in games like Imperial Assault/Descent or TMNT.

A simple dungeon battling adventure game.

I was disapointed that some of the cardboard pieces tore simply bending them to put them into shape before I had even played 1 game.

Also with the long shape of the box many of the pieces broke simply because another box was placed ontop.

As for the game, it was good but not great. Would have been nice to have a modular board. Also the frequency of items and lack of leveling was a big disapointment for me.

I bought this game many years ago and kept playing it for years. I liked it back then although I'm not sure if this still would be true today. It hasn't hit the table for quite a long time now and I guess it won't in the near future since you have to play it with the right group. Most of my gaming friends aren't into fantasy stuff, so I guess I just keep the memory of countless afternoons on which I enjoyed this game and had fun killing orcs and skeletons.

Did not go over that well with my friends, who I thought would enjoy a simplified fantasy/rpg-like game.  I think a series of horrific rolls and bad decisions on their part is what killed it for them.  Will try again someday, unless I sell it.

Despite serious flawed rules and mechanics, I always seem to come back to this game and have been playing it ever since its release in '89. With some of the most recognizable minis and artwork in any board game, my friends and I are easily able to look past its shortcomings and have a good time.

Like an RPG, this game benefits highly from a good GM to contextualize the rediculousness of the setting and game play; inserting humorous table talk, adding lurid descriptions of the dungeons and monsters, underscoring the rapacious greed of the "heroes", etc. After two decades of playing hero quest, that part of the game has become a huge part of its enjoyment and sustained our interest in what otherwise would have been a forgettable game.

This is a classic from my childhood, I can recall designing my own dungeons on grid paper.  Kelsey and I just played our first scenario of this, and had a great time.  I improvised a couple of minor changes to the scenario to spice it up, and I allowed Kelsey to improvise tactical maneuvres that would allow her to potentially earn an extra attack die.  We used the  Mind stat as a skill-check number to determine if the clever move will work or not. Kelsey had a lot of fun creating her characters, appreciated how easy and fun it was to houserule, and really enjoyed the adventure.  When the campaign ended and I told her that her characters would carry over to the next scenario, and that she could upgrade them at the armoury with her gold, she was really pleased.  We're both looking forward to the next quest!  I'm really happy that this game lived up to my fond memories.

I'm not enamoured of this game, its fine once in a while but not much more - too simple for my tastes(which is odd, as I like an occasional light game).

I didn't think I would like this game as much as I do.  Of all of the components, I find the unpainted miniatures take away from the eye candy for the rest of the game.  My mini painting isn't up to par, so, I replaced all minis with D&D minis, and wow!  What a difference.  I was the Evil Sorcerer vs. 3 heroes.  I think this game is geared to 5 players.  The party had 3 characters (of which, none were the Barbarian).  The party had a tough time & lost.  I'm looking forward to playing this again as either a 2 / 3 / 5 player.

This game is what started it all off for me.  I love Heroquest with a passion and even bought spares off Ebay to make up a full set.

This one I have a tough time rating. As a kid I rolled for movement each and every time and the heroes moving at different paces, combined with an eagerness to explore and a lack of resource maximization made the game tense and exciting. Years later I played as an adult and played like I play now and it wasn't even fun. The overlord needs inefficiency to have a chance, so when I played with my 9 year old nephew I was an amazing experience. What I saw was me years back and I helped as little as possible but did try to teach different ways to think about things. Amazing experience bonding with my nephew.

I played a lot when I was a kid growing up. I enjoyed the game as a kid, but I won't be playing again as an adult unless to spend time with niece's and nephew's etc. Or possibly some non-gamers. If so, they should have a copy of the game in question. I don't have my own copy since I switch from american board games to euro board games.

D&D Dungeon Crawl. Could be considered as a classic. Hard to find these days since it's OOP. Basic game you could still find. Expansions are harder to get. Replayability is zero once you did all the scenarios. 

You can always do your own quest. If you do, would it be well balanced? Is it going to be too easy or too hard for the heroes?

Very light game, simple. D&D in is simplest form.

Haven't played Hero Quest in an age, but I've still got the old box kicking around here. It brings back some odd memories playing with friends or against my brother.

Got this specifically to play with my two boys, 10 & 12. Big hit. I played the evil lord and forced them to work together. Left too much to my legendary poor dice-rolling skills but for the purpose of killing off an afternoon, it was ideal. 10-year old gives it a 10, 12-year old a 9. Both are now feverishly working on their own quests.

RATING: 8
I am a long-time AD&D player. I have also played games like Magic, Warhammer and a lot of the other popular fantasy themed games. Heroquest started all of that for me when I received the game as a Christmas present in my youth. It was a gateway game or sort for me, although less into board-gaming in general than into sword and sorcery themed games and media. 

It's been awhile since I've picked the game up. There is, after all, a lot of competition in the dungeon crawl game, and while Heroquest is a home-run in terms of components, design, and tone, it does not have a lot of strategic complexity. It's still a very fun game, and very quick to pick up and give a play, and my friends and I have used it to get others into gaming. 

The mechanics are very well designed and intuitive, and the balance between characters is very strong. It might be too easy for the heroes to succeed in most of the quests, and a lot of the monsters are practically harmless on their own, but overall I am still highly impressed by the game's design and balance. The dice system has been adopted and copied by many games in recent years, but nothing beats the old skull face staring back at you. 

There are a few expansions, although all but two are incredibly rare and expensive. The game is pretty easy to homebrew new stuff for, so it's easy enough to add on new quests, monsters, and treasure on your own. There used to be a card-editor online. 

Heroquest really shines in the components department. Fantasy dungeon furniture? It's amazing that no one else has done this since then (edit: it looks like someone else finally did!). Everything that comes in the box is of incredibly high quality and very evocative of the fantasy theme (which is borrowed from Warhammer, and therefore a little "darker" than Tolkien-esque fantasy). The board is also brilliantly designed and very flexible despite its fixed nature. The individual spaces are a little small at times, but it's a far better board than the ones in Dragon Strike and similar "D&D lite" games from the same period.

I like dungeoncrawls and this one is a classic.  The components are wonderful, with a huge variety of pieces of furniture and other elements that gives a lot of extra details to the miniatures element to the game.

However it's too simple for me.  No real character advancement and the combat isn't that engaging.  It was fun for a couple of sessions, but we quickly moved on to more elaborate dungeoncrawls and found ourselves delighted with Warhammer Quest.

A fun little dungeon crawler. It definitely suffers from being a product of its time. A little too random, the movement is too boring and dice driven. I'd much rather play something that handles the dungeon crawler aspect better, like Descent 2nd Edition or Gloomhaven or Imperial Assault.

Excellent beer and pretzels dungeon crawl, in fact the best I've played yet, mostly because of the excellent quests. The main things that annoy me are the lack of experience levels and most especiallly the way the game handles searching for traps and secret doors.

I got this game when I was about 12, but I never had anyone to really play with.  I also thinking the rules were a little complicated, now that I've read through them and am a lot older that's obviously not the case!  This is basically the ultra basic version of Dungeons & Dragons.  You basically have a dungeon master that brings the heroes through pre-designed Dungeon's in the Quest Book.  It's a decent system and rather fun, but some of the major flaws involve the fact that there is no incentive for the heroes to really rack up the kills.  There's no mechanism that gives the heroes experience, the most it has is that searching for treasure will get you money and you can buy items from the armory.  This is the most you get for upgrades for the heroes.  The monsters, however, don't get any stronger so the game seems to get a little unbalance as you go on and the heroes have better armor.  Some monsters get to use more spells later in the game though.  Definitely a classic game though.

I mostly credit Magic: The Gathering for propelling me into Boardgame Super-Nerdom, but the truth of the matter is that old school games like HeroQuest, Dungeon Strike, Omega Virus, Fireball Island, and Crash Canyon are what really captivated my imagination and defined my love for gaming early on in life. Among those mentioned I have to say that this game is my true favorite. I really enjoyed creating my own stories and dungeon layouts. It's a shame that this game didn't survive one of the floods at my home as a child :-(

I suppose I'm biased against boardgames that try to be RPGs (in this case, D&D), since they have no chance of being what they try to emulate. I bristle at any boardgame pretending to be a RPG. I realize that a boardgame has no chance of ever measuring up against a good RPG session, but if you want to play a boardgame, pick a boardgame - say, E&T. Anyway, HeroQuest does two things right in its desire to be the pale shadow of D&D - it makes one of the players the DM. This has to be the case, and it's where many of the other wannabes whiff hard. You HAVE to have a DM. The other thing that it does right is that it makes the other players a PARTY, i.e., it's cooperative. This is another MUST. Otherwise, I guarantee that the RPG-wannabe game experience will be quite crappy. See Runebound for a positively awful RPG-wannabe. If you absolutely must dungeon-delve, and can't find someone with the time or ability to be the DM, then I guess HQ is your best bet. Some might notice that it sorta feels like the kiddie version of D&D3.X's combat system. Must be the reason why it's sought after for parts to make a good D&D3.X dungeon encounter map. Anyway, the player who's gonna be the GM ( aka "The Big Z") still needs to put in a bit of preparation in order to give the group the best HQ experience. If no one wants to do that, then trust me, play Puerto Rico instead.

I finally tried the "original" boardgame dungeon crawl. I have to say that hit holds up really well. This is not entirely surprising as the rules have been re-applied in so many other games I have played, that I barely had to be taught how to play. The only complaint I have is that it so stripped down and simplified that it is hard to compare with current games that add a bit more flare to the experience. Still, it's great fun for what it is, and, perhaps most importantly, it ends before the fun does, which is a problem I find endemic to most modern thematic high fantasy games I play these days.

One of my first non mainstream games, and me and my friends would play it all the time (actually if you can believe how geeky I was, I remember bringing it to an afternoon party and gathering some guys to play it in the backroom while the rest of the crowd was putting some music on and starting to dance). We just loved it. Would it feel too simple if I played today, or uninteresting? Maybe, I don't know, but I'm sure glad I had it back then and it gave me all those great memories.

This was the game I saved up months of allowance, after my parents thought this would be the right time to learn about saving money.  I spent hours playing it as a kid.  These days, HeroQuest certainly fills that dungeon crawler itch and it isn't bogged down by pages of rules.  Essentially, it comes down to dice rolls, but it is a beautiful game and for the nostalgia it has a warm place in my heart.  HeroQuest does do what the title says: Heroes will win if they work together instead of trying to take on the dungeon by themselves.  It's not terribly deep, but the quests are at least always interesting.  There are definitely better fantasy and fighting games when it comes to mechanics, but when I want a fantasy fighting game that I can teach to anybody in a couple minutes and they are willing to role-play a little, well, you can't look any further than HeroQuest.

RATING: 9.5
HeroQuest was my gateway into combat games when I was a kid, and therefore will always have a special place in my collection.  It's a fair argument that more modern war games have made this one 'obsolete', but HeroQuest was revolutionary for its time.  With a plot right out of the likes of Conan the Barbarian, this retro 1980's fantasy theme is a treasure in itself.  Another reason this game is such a gem is that the system is very malleable for incorporating your own additions and variants.  If played with variants like (1) an autonomous Zargon ('bad guy') and (2) randomized dungeon, this is the pinnacle of the perfect dungeon crawl board game in my book.

$1.98 thrift find. As good fortune would have it, almost a complete second set of HQ pieces was included in the box. No wonder it was so heavy.

Update: Half way through the quests with me as Zargon and girlfriend as Heroes. My minions constantly being steamrolled by superhuman heroes is getting a bit tiresome...Lowered rating.

I played the hell out of this when I was younger.  It's a good game and a lot of fun.  The furniture was certainly cool!  I had most of the expansions as well.  The game is slightly simplistic, but that's ok for what it is.  The reason the rating of this is so low, just a 6, is that I would much rather play/own Warhammer quest.  Warhammer Quest completely duplicates this experience and is far superior.

This holds a special place in my heart. I believe I was 10 or 11 when I got this for Christmas. It showed me how amazing a board game could be. It still looks amazing to this day. Some of the game-play has been improved upon (see Descent) but this is still speedier and gives you he sense of a great classic fantasy story in the process.

What a great dungeon crawler for kids, people who aren't gamers, or people that want a beer n pretzels fantasy romp.

This is another game where I have yet to see someone interested in it play and be dissappointed.

Is it deep? No. Is it totally luck based? Well, no. There is some basic strategy in choosing what rooms to open and when, when to search for secret doors or traps, and plenty built into individual adventures.

An excellent introduction to the broader world of gaming, modelled, as it is, on the concept of one player taking the role of dungeon master and the others that of adventurers. A streamlined combat and movement system, along with some great components, help create a fast paced, atmospheric game that all parties should enjoy.

Although the base game only comes with 14 quests there is a facility to design your own and the big board is essentially modular thanks to the tiles and furniture available.

Ideal for children a few years in double digits who enjoy their fantasy.

When I was a kid, my friends wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.  I did not.  

What I did want to play was a game that captured the essence of D&D and distilled it down into something that was simpler, more fun, and beautiful to look at.  A game that gave me the thrill of crushing deadly monsters and exploring dusty stone corridors and came to life in three dimensions on my table...without spending hours doing paperwork and poring over silly "dungeon master's guides".  

It may be argued that the gameplay is too simple to stand the test of time, and no one would ever want to play this today.  But in its day, it was truly a groundbreaking effort.  It was the RPG anyone could play.  It took the dreariness and nerdiness of D&D and made it into an accessible, immersive experience.  It is, in the truest sense of the word, a classic.

Playing this as a seven year old at a friend`s house I was totally enthralled. It was the first thing close to an RPG I had ever seen and did a good job on sparking the interest. The Finnish translation is also a bit of a classic.

My rating is based heavily on nostalgic memories, though on the other hand I certainly would not turn down this if someone was to suggest it.

Adquirido usado estado casi perfecto. 

EL clasico dungeon crawler por excelencia. 

Las mecanicas a dia de hoy son algo simples, en algunos materiales se nota la edad (hoja de papel para llevar stats, tablero de dos alas que se usa para todo en vez del tablero modular moderno) pero sigue siendo una introduccion perfecta al genero y el juego no ha perdido su inmersividad en la tematica, que no todos los juegos modernos tienen. 

En mi opinion, insustituible y parada obligatoria. 

Clasifica como Clasico Atemporal.

The game had strong potential. But the scenarios were so incredibly unbalanced that the game collapses beneath its own weight. The first scenario is damn near impossible to beat. If you beat it, all the other scenarios are cake walks. 

The miniatures and other components were the best of its vintage however. A shame the game was better.

The game that started it all for me.  I still remember a lot of the rules 15 years later.   This game holds up surprisingly well, and is better than a lot of the dungeon crawls being put out today, especially if you play with the expansions.  This game was well before its time.  Only descent do I prefer, and Descent is definitely a descendant...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only play 2 player, and add about 300% more monsters than scenarios show, and you really have an ok, albeit very basic dungeon romp. One of the 1st dungeon crawl experiences i ever had. Then it became a staple filler game between AD&D campaigns during my misspent youth!
I Have 2 1/2 base sets crammed into 1 box I think!?
Painted

Gonna DIY the expansions and get my 8 yr old lad into this one, hack and slash early doors, just like his old man before him! Learn him good, that there is life beyond minecraft and fifa 14, before its too late!

----------------------------
Update may 2015.
Well, didn't get it to the table til he was 9, but after playing the Trial with him, he decided he wanted to be the monsters, I was dubious, but he did ok. Me and his sister had 2 heroes each and he ran 4 quests in a row, with just a little help. He is enamoured with the whole thing. Wants to do one after another til his sis collapses from game exhaustion!
Happy days. Shows this simple system transcends eras. Gotta stand up and show respect where it's due.

The only game from my childhood that I insisted on making the trip with me into adulthood.  Heroquest was the first real toy that I ever bought with my own money.  The duct-taped box still is in my closet today and I look forward to introducing my son to my beat up copy in the near future.

The game play itself is RPG-lite which makes it a great introductory game for new or younger board gamers.  It introduces a lot of concepts and can be set up to be played as a campaign which is something that really has come back into focus in the last few years with "legacy" games.  

For it's time Heroquest was amazing considering the market for RPGs was almost non-existant and the board gaming scene was dominated by the Monopoly(s) of the world.  It still holds up many, many years later even with several generations of improvements in the epic fantasy board gaming genre.  One thing that still sets Heroquest apart is it's use of actual scenery such as tables, bookshelves, weaponracks, etc. which I have yet to find in modern games that are all about putting the money into the plastic monsters and heroes.

One of the best dungeon crawlers of all time. Sure, it lacks modern game mechanics, but the art style and game material are absolutely lovely, especially in regard of its release date.

Lots of fun for preteen+ boys to adults. The board is limited, you will see your heroes guessing locations by process of elimination, but it goes with the simplicity of the overall game. 

Easy to use and rules easy to understand, after a round or two it'll be smooth sailing., very few ambiguities in the rules, especially with all the different versions out there. So decide which version then stick with it. 

A classic: get it while it's still cheap!

I still have this, but unfortunately the pieces are scattered all over my house.  A great game for quick streamlined dungeon crawling.  It does not compare to true RPGs, but is great for a light weight game.  The rules are very easy to learn, but the game lacks depth.  Production value was very good.  Expansions added some new stuff to play with and some varying gamepay.

Great intro game for younger gamers leading in to more advanced games in the same genre.

I have played this game more than any other game in my life. I received my first set as a gift nearly ten years ago and it was literally played to death. Nostalgia is a big factor for my rating and although I don&#039;t play it that much anymore as in those days I still return to it from time to time. Internet is full of messageboards dedicated to house rules and other development of the basic game, so while it may be out of print it definetly hasn&#039;t been forgotten. A grand little game.

This was really the first non standard board game I bought, by which I mean not monopoly, scrabble, chess, etc. I guess my fascination with components began here - Ameritrash as they call it here. I painted all the figures over many long winter evenings as a student in a bedsit, and bought the expansions too. I still sometimes remember those days very fondly, just patiently painting up these little characters and playing both solo games and games with the gf of the time (who enjoyed it too).

As intense as any of my younger probingings into dungeon crawling.  Played allot with my cheater older brother becuase the game was pretty cheat proof.  Still he cheated, he was like a cheat-o-holic, it didn't matter how much he lost or gained from cheating he still did it.  You'd think that there would be a rehab for people like that.  He still talks about all the games we played when I se him and it makes me want to crush his freakin windpipe I mean how in the heck does he think he can slip in an extra mummy when I've run the same scenerio he's running?  I've got a plan for cheaters that involves a fencepost and some tires...I suppose it's a waste of time ranting about cheaters but what are you reading this for anyway; you're never going to own this game and if you do you already know that it's awsome...bah!, I'm going to need more tires.  -H7

The granddaddy of simple dungeon crawlers, and my personal introduction to "modern" gaming. Many since have done it better, but for its time, it was done extremely well. RPG elements and character progression is an undeniable draw, although overpowered heroes cause some balancing issues later in the game. Near infinite replayability thanks to a devoted community and their created content on Ye Olde Inn.

Due to its popularity however, finding a playable copy at a decent price can be challenging, and expansions (when available) are expensive.

RATING: 4
Played a lot in my youth but, playing it again now as an adult, its simplicity shows.  There are lots of things I would want to change to make this a more interesting game but I guess that's not the point; I would be better off getting a different game in that case.  For what it is, it can be fun.  It's not really great with only two people (even with the hero player taking on more than one role).  As for the components, they're fine overall.  I'm not much into minis but these ones are serviceable (mine are unpainted and may remain that way).  The light, wooden dice suck.  Regarding the quests, we've only played through the first one (I obviously played all of them in the distant past) and it was frustratingly vague: what is the goal of the first quest?  To just run in and bash monsters?  To kill the gargoyle?  Or the mummy?  To get treasure?  It's never actually mentioned.  I hope the other quests are more detailed.

Anyway, it would probably still be a lot of fun with the full complement of 5 players along with commensurate beer supplies.  I'm looking forward to giving *that* scenario a try.

This was one of my favorite games in my youth. I was fascinated by it and had to get every expansion for it. I was surprised to find out how much this was worth when I joined BGG and then even more surprised when my Mom brought up all my old stuff one day and I found I still had this game and all its expansions and they were all in perfect quality. It brought back a lot of memories. 

It's an excellent game still and I love it. However, if you don't have memories for it, I'd say go straight for Descent and the expansions for that game. They'll be far more game and depth for you to enjoy there.

One of my favorite games from my childhood.  This game satisfied the part of me that really wanted to play D&D in an area of the country that it didn't exist.  High adventure, if a bit simplistic.  A great gateway fantasy/adventure boardgame.  I will play this with my son when he is old enough.

I have every single piece.

RATING: 7
This is the game that started it all for me. From here I found Magic: The Gathering and I never looked back enjoying fantasy-adventure for the rest of my life. The game itself is relatively basic and dated at this point but still holds up with nostalgia and incredible furniture and components that were well above the norm for the time, and even for today. The game-play is fun and rewarding for kids and teens and a good casual time for adults alike as long as expectations are kept in check. This game will always have a special place in my heart and is a worthy own for anyone who enjoyed it as a kid. Probably not worth the very high ticket price for anyone who has no experience with it, however.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rules read, not yet played. Pretty neat looking system but really a low-level Dungeon crawl probably better for teens or beginners. System could be adapted quite easy for improvements which I will try but overall this will get a rating no higher than 6 as I see it and maybe a 5 with no changes.

Update: Well I finally got to play this and yeah it is quite dated. It's really a cool system bringing the D&D basics to a board game that I would have loved when I was like age 7 to 12 (albeit when this came out I was already too old to really enjoy it) which is really the age group I recommend it for, adults should look elsewhere like WHQ. 

The base game is quite limited w/o expansions as there are only 14 quests included although you could easily design more. Really a neat little system but not enough variety to be interesting for adults, every game feels the same and there is is no meat on the system its just WAY too basic. 

House rules could improve this rating as could expansions but with better choices around why bother. High raters influenced by nostalgia should really update their ratings and comments as to not mislead people.

Hero Quest is a pseudo RPG that can be worth it when you play with people that are inexperienced roleplayers, or you simply want simpler entertainment an eevning when people are not prepared for real RPG. It is one of the most mod-able games I know of, and it allows you to add almost anything in your home into the game. If you got spare miniatures from other games, they can easily be used together with your Hero Quest game. There are whupping 7 expansions, all of theese downloadable from heroquest.no-ip.com.

RATING: 7.5
That game is very good if we consider the time it appeared (1989). The main strenghts of the game is that the system is fully customisable, and that the "quests" that are sold are only ... "guides", in fact. 

The main weakness is that your characters reach a "cap" rather fast in their evolution, which is really sad. After reaching that "cap", usually, the main strategies has been discovered, so everything becomes somehow redondant.

On the other hand, having a quick, simple adventuring game that allow infinites possibilities is something great, in my idea. Since the game is customisable, the weak points can be easily overpassed in many ways... without changing the rules much.

D&D on an easy playability scale, a nice intro for your kids to a semi-role-playing game. Bought the set for my son which he still has and played until worn out. I painted the figs but he abandoned it when he moved so I sold the game and 2 expansions for $35 at Cold Wars 06. The painted miniatures were worth more than that.
I now pieced it together from ebay and the internet plus my own minis to make a hybrid game and kicking myself in the ass for ever selling it so cheap.
Note: The hybrid version I cobbled together works GREAT and I was running 3 different gaming groups with everyone LOVING what I created.

Nostalgia is strong with this one!

Heroquest is for many the gateway into miniatures games. Rightfully so. 

It had all the stuff needed to create an easy to approach creative and immersive gaming experience. 
The miniatues were of a high quality (of that time), thematically coherent, the game itself was supported by a lot of lovely detailed trinkets like skullcovered racks or rat infested library shelfs, open and closed doors and cardboard game effects. 
Gameplay was based around missions, which ended with us writing missions ourselves oncd we ran through the prewritten ones, thus creating our own adventures. 

Heroquest might be outdated now, but it showed that a lot of love and creativity went into it, making it well worth the price it demanded back then.

It also was THE founding stone for many 1 vs. Many games to come in the future, them always being measured against it.

In my opinion it was the best recreation of a default high fantasy scenario in a game. 

A masterpiece of its time.

Much like Talisman is the first of it's kind, this game was the first forage into a dungeon with cool minis and furniture pieces and prearranged scenarios. At least the first that I know of. It was always amazing to me how many different scenarios they could get using the same board over and over yet keeping it fresh every time. Admittedly I didn't get to play this much with a group but I made my own solo rules and had quite a bit of fun with this. It's simple but there was a lot of imagination put into the making of this game and there is an unbelievable amount of fan support stuff for this game. You can usually get the main game for a reasonable amount on e-bay. You could do a lot worse.

RATING: 10
Bought a used, complete, copy of this.
When it came out, I was into "real" roleplaying games, and dismissed it as kiddie nonsense...
As I´ve since grown older and mature enough to actually appreciate kiddie nonsense, I´ve been wanting it for some time, and now I´ve got it! 

If you´re looking for the expansions, and can live with homemade versions, you can find everything needed, except the figures, at: http://www.yeoldeinn.com/

Amazingly as it sounds, the danish version of the game, which I´ve got, is simpler than the american version!!!
I´ve remedied this, by printing out the rules, quests, chaos spells and artefact cards from "Ye Olde Internet Site" 
It seems I will have to add the monster cards to that, as ALL monsters in the danish version have only 1 body point!
(have since added american monster stats AND spell cards to my game, no original danish components are any longer in play... sad, but has given me a much better game...)

I rate the game a 10 for the fun I´m having playing through the basic game scenarios with my girlfriend "as the heroes", and me reliving the good old days of DM´ing a roleplaying campaign... I try my best to kill her though...
 In some ways this is the game that brings me full circle as a gamer, as I got seriously into RPGs in the middle 80s.

Due to their simplicity (and a few flaws) I won´t rate the rules and overall game design more than an 8, when compared to some of it´s descendants, like Descent, which has much more elaborate and elegant rules, but it still scores a much more important 10 for intense fun, that doesn´t drag out ad nauseam...

And why has NO ONE made CHEAP, nice looking, sturdy, mass-produced cardboard/plastic dungeon furnishings in the more than 10 years since this game went out of print?  I, and many other DM's, still use these for Dungeons & Dragons.Ah well, a good game.

Miniatures dungeon crawl from the late 80s. I might have liked it around that time, too, but now it feels awkward in several ways: the need for a referee with few options; repetitive tactical positioning and procedural exploration in repetitive missions; front-loaded, equipment-based character improvement. The quests are kind of drab in that they are virtually free of puzzle-solving elements, character interaction or other context-specific choices on a higher level of abstraction. The game does allow you to create new missions or items and tinker with rules and stats if you want to.

Well, i used to love this as a teen and I'm sure I got my money's worth out of it.  We played the original scenarios to death, and I think this was the first time I'd ever heard of an expansion pack.  

Good for it's time, it just got repetetive and boring after playing with the base scenarios a couple of times, plus most of the quest packs once or twice.  I always wished there were more characters, and it pretty much fell off of my group's radar once we started Talisman. 

There are much better dungeoncrawlers on the market now.

Heroquest is the foundation of the Heroscape combat system and it looks like a fun dungeon crawl rpg-lite to play with the family.  I can see myself playing this with my kids several years from now.  
**Edit**  This is a game you could live in.  You can play it for hours, tweak it to your liking, download the seemingly endless supply of fan-created content and change everything to play how you like.  It really is the perfect toolbox for RPG'ers (dungeon crawlers) who don't have the time or fancy for a full-blown, rolling-on-tables RPG campaign.  If you want to live a fantasy story in short, non-committal board game length segments, this game is your toolbox.

If I didn't own a copy of HeroQuest, I probably wouldn't track it down. But despite some dated mechanics, it is still fun for an afternoon of mindless dice chucking.

I think this was my first Dungeon Crawl boardgame. Back in the 90's I played this a lot with a couple of friends.
Even if the mechanics and rules can't stand against the boardgames which you can get nowadays it is still old school and I wont miss it in my collection!

This game is just awesome to play if you're Zargon (the gamemaster). I always enjoy changing up the scenarios and making up new enemies. I have only played once as the heroes and I didn't like it as much that way. Another game that's better with more than 2 players.

HeroQuest is one of those classic games that was ahead of it's time, as it managed to deliver an excellent dungeon crawling experience that has withstood the passage of time. 

One player controls the evil guys while each of the other players controls an adventurer. Adventurers get to stomp on baddies, acquire treasures and all these sort of things, while the evil master tries to kill them. It's fairly dice heavy, yet the system is refined enough so that it's difficult to be constantly unlucky. All of this means that the game is fast, simple and fun.

The bad part of it is that a lot of games have developed and refined the formula and, truly, some have done it way better. I, like many others, play it because of the nostalgia factor, not because it's the best of its genre. If you haven't played HeroQuest by now don't bother in acquiring a copy and aim for some other dungeon crawler like [gameid=17226], to name one. If you are looking for a kids game HeroQuest can be a safer choice though, as its simpler.

I dig this silly game, but I prefer Warhammer Quest (I play a modified version of that).  Still, I give props to the original (I think!) hack n' slash boardgame.  FAR better than TSR's Dragon Strike, which devalued the D&D atmosphere.

Well "basic" Heroquest should be rated 6 only but I give 9 for the whole. I mean Heroquest + expansions + all the additional fan-made cards (characters, spell, tresure,...) you can find on Internet ou do yourself.

Rating assumes one of the players is my 6-year-old; otherwise, this is a 4 or maybe even a 2.  So far the boy seems to prefer being Zargon, which is OK with me...

I got this in trade based on suggestions in this thread: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/99735

Update: after 5 or so plays, dropping this to a 6 even when one of the players is my 6-year-old.  It's just so boring!

Update: dropping this to a 2.  After playing Descent, there's no conceivable reason I would ever play this again.

I got fond memories of this being my gateway to RPG:s at the age of 10. While probably there are better options for a light dungeon crawl these days, I'd like to refresh my memory. The US rules with tougher monsters sound good, rating could rise if I got to try it out again with those.

HeroQuest got me into miniature games and while the game has its flaws and surely could use some balance tweaks, I love to play it to this day. Actually this might be my favorite game ever. I like that the gameplay isn't too complicated, so it's easy for newcomers and younger players to grasp this game and get into it. Also unlike Descent, the bad guy in HeroQuest doesn't feel pressured to win against the heroes, but usually wants them to win as well (at least in my games).
Unfortunately, even though I like the game, it doesn't hit the table anymore. The few times I tried to play this over the last few years, we stopped playing after about 10 minutes each time, because people were whining about how the game was too random and boring.
Even though a rating of 9 might seem a little bloated, considering I don't even play this anymore, this still is one of my favourite games ever. Everyone else has to take the rating with a grain of salt, since the game apparently didn't age very well and some people outright dislike it.

After much house-ruling and home-brewing, this game can become pretty great. I've never run across another game that is so customizable, and yet has such a solid and fun foundation. Usually the games with a solid foundation can't be changed very much without spoiling the balance or the gameplay, and the games that are highly customizable usually have an underwhelming foundation full of holes and ambiguities. (Well, this does have a few rules holes, but they're all very easily mended, so ... whatever.) Plus, this has a phenomenal set of miniatures and dungeon items!

The components are interesting. Still, there is really few long term interest. It's enter a room and kill all people.

This game is a lot like the Dungeons and Dragons adventure games, just simplified. While I enjoy this game, it's simplicity makes it better for a younger crowd not ready for the more complicated DnD games.

Have many fond memories of playing this as a young teen.  Great game, takes D&D fantasy theme and puts it into a variable dungeon.  I always loved being the Dungeon Master.  The combat system is dice-driven, but they strip it down to its essence with simple "hit" or "miss" dice.  In fact, my experiences with Heroquest had a lot to do with me trying "Betrayal at House on the Hill", and the latter game's poor quality made me appreciate how good HQ was.

I can't find my copy of this anymore but would like to get it again.  I'm sure my rating is a bit inflated by nostalgia, but at its core I believe this is a well-done and highly themed game.

While remarkable in a number of ways - a dungeon crawl-themed boardgame from a department store games brand, published in the 1980s with a clean ruleset - HeroQuest isn't really for me, at least in the current millenium. It takes one of my least favourite aspects of roleplaying games (crawling through a dungeon that has nothing in it that spurs the imagination) and does it while offering fewer tactical choices (although there are a couple minor tactical tricks to tease out) and interesting decisions than redbox D&D or even (from its reputation) Tunnels & Trolls. It's also pretty random, even for a dice game. It can suffer pretty badly from "big result at the right/wrong time" issues.

Still, I don't hate HQ, and would be willing to play it again under appropriate circumstances. It's almost enough to pique my interest in the Fantasy Flight dungeon crawl games, all of which are obviously descendants of this (faded) classic.

As far as early dungeon crawls go, it wasn't that bad.  I really liked the idea of creating a whole bunch of maps from what was essentially the same map with different doors and furniture.  It killed some hours kindly in my youth, but it's been well surpassed since.

Lost many childhood hours to this DnD primer from Milton Bradley. It was such a good "out of the box" system for beginners that it was hard not to love. I may have left it behind for real pen and paper RPG games today but I will always hang on to my battered copy.

Heroquest is a miniature game with basic heroes (an elf, a barbarian, a wizards and a dwarf) and lots of miniatures. The gameplay is very simple, roll two 6-sided dice for movement, move and do an action for the turn. One player has to control evil Chaos forces so 2 players is minimum. The board starts clean with only heroes, stair tile and a single door. Player controlling Chaos adds monsters and furniture to the board as you explore the rooms - he has to consult the map in the quest book. That makes the game exciting because you never now what lies behind the doors (although the shape and size of the room is visible on the board. You can also search for traps and treasure. Searching for traps cost you nothing (I think) and can save you life but searching for treasure makes you draw a card for treasure card deck and half of the times a monster attacks from nowhere (immediately rolling dice).

There is a lot of dice rolling. The dice, apart from normal dice for movement, are custom and feature skulls and black and white shields. It is still fun but if you dislike dice rolling you should be weary that it is the heart of the game. For me it was less mundane than 40k but on par or even more important then let say Blood Bowl. It is often a relief when you don't have to fight for a turn or two. 

If you like miniatures then, well, you are in for a treat. They are quite nice and there is lots of them. The gargoyle is so large that it almost doesn't fit next to a hero. And the size difference makes it clear that one is more dangerous than the other. The miniatures are not as detailed and dynamic as in Warhammer Quest though.
There is a lot of furniture (wardrobes, desks, tables, a throne, even a fireplace) to make the dungeon more believable. 

So, the game is easy and it looks good but is it good? Yes and know. For young kids (like 8+, the cover says 10+) it is great. They often don't see repeated dice throwing a chore and will find plastic toy figures amazing. Adults have to treat it as kids game - extremely simple and quite easy to beat. Playing two or three quest is probably the most you can endure without being bored. I would recommend playing with kids.

This was an amazing game when it first came out, but I rarely ever play it today.  The one thing this game does well that no table-top Swords & Sorcery board game has done since is the great sense of exploration.  It's nothing fancy, just good old fashioned kicking down doors to rooms and killing monsters.  I really wish someone would go back to the basics and do exploration like this again.

I also own Return of the Witch Lord and Kellar's Keep.

I wanted this game after seeing it on the Toy R Us shelves but my parent's aversion to the fantasy genre kept it out of my grasp. Years later my Dad bought me an intact copy off of eBay as a Christmas gift. This game was always great for late night gaming sessions. It has the character evolution of an RPG, they mystery of exploration, and tension between DM and players ... all wrapped within a simpler game mechanics for a wider range of players. And lots of plastic furniture.

This game has a number of elements that makes it a fantastic and enduring game:

- The rules are not just easy to learn, but also easy to house-rule without braking to game.
- The unique dice mechanics are simple and fun.
- Use of 3-D doors and furniture to give the game life, then just the maze of empty rooms found in other games like it.
- The premises of the game (easy rule and 3-D props) allows for importing of other rules, maps, figures, props, cars, and such - many hardcore fans would cannibalize all sorts of games and toys into it!
- The art is fantastic and has a gritty Dark Fantasy feel this is missing in most other fantasy games.
- For a number of players, this was a "gateway drug" to the wider world of role-playing games - most typically Dungeons & Dragons.

1.2.2014 Review: Much like Space Crusade, this grand old man of dungeon adventure hasn't changed much in the last 24 years, so there is no reason to change the rating either way. Descent 2nd Ed. has definitely replaced this as the go-to fantasy romp, but Heroquest will see itself played once the younger gamers are old enough to begin their brainwashing.

Not convinced. Yes, it plays quite quickly and it's very simple to get into, wich is a plus in the dungeon crawler genre.

Still, the game was pretty boring as the game master, since there is nothing to do once the heroes cleared a room. Besides, your monsters feel like they're made of glass.

I don't see how this is much better then the Dungeon & Dragons boardgame I already own.

Rating this game seems to come down to if it was early in your fantasy gaming experience or if you're playing it for the first time just recently. 

I belong in the first camp, and I love it. I'll be first to admit that it's not aged the best, but its still genius. It's designed for young players and to be played in homes where every other game on the shelf is life, and monopoly battleship and the like. Compared to the other games of the day you'd likely find on sale along side it in the game isle of your local supermart it was complex, innovative and gorgeous.

Hero Quest is a vintage game. The forefather of games like Descent or Imperial Assault. My copy has NO MISSING COMPONENTS!! However, due to its age, this game has some wear:

1) The box lid has torn corners.
2) One of the six original tiny green goblins has a broken sword (broken piece included). It's fixable with super glue, but I wanted to leave that up to the buyer.
3) The open door frames (not the closed ones) are mostly bent/creased. 

I have photographs of all these pieces in my gallery. I encourage you to view them so that you know exactly what you're getting before purchasing. 

All other pieces, including the spell cards, game board, miniatures, original rule book, DM privacy shield, etc. are all intact and in good shape. Even the original pad with character sheets is about 75% still there. This is a very playable copy of a 25 year old board game.

Looks like rather uncomplicated fun of the sort that would be great for bringing young gamers into the fold. I can see why some people feel this is dated, and I suppose it is dated. But I think this would be okay, having as it does the virtues of fast learning and quick play.

I seen the TV advert for this at about 11 years old and it ignited my imagination. Wish I got to play more of it as a kid! Always avoided the wizard, turns out he's the most fun to play! Plenty of House Rules and other game boards to really spice it up.

I have fond memories of using HeroQuest to introduce new gamers to the concepts of fantasy adventure gaming.  Main usage of this game in recent years has involved the use of its miniatures (including the great array of furniture and 'dungeon-dressing'). They have been very useful in many other games including RPGs, Warhammer and others...

I haven't played regularly since high school but we had some great fun with it.  It might have had a broader impact had we not been so deeply enmeshed in AD&D already.  

A superb game for introducing kids (or even befuddled adults) to a dungeon crawl.  Plus the board and pieces can be adapted for use in other games and rpg's quite nicely.
  
Still one of the best dungeon crawl games in terms of ease, accessibility and kit customization.  Much better than some of the modern, rules bloated adventure games.

My cousins and I had regular sessions of this for years- when we depleted the included scenarios we bought the expansions (which we didn't like as much) or made our own (which we liked more). In the cold light of adulthood, it's not as good as I'd like- it's slow-moving and more luck driven than I remember- but those childhood memories can't be replaced. Nor can this game, apparently- still my dungeon crawl of choice, warts and all.

Another cheap carboot pick-up (100% complete and in good nick FTW!) Started playing last weekend much to my wife's delight, as she has very fond memories of this game.

I'd never played before and quite enjoyed being the Evil Wizard. Felt it could be more challenging for the players, and I'm also not convinced at the logic of having the monsters as all, in effect, one hit-point hero fodder.

RATING: 9.5
[i]Fighting Fantasy[/i] books -> D&D -> this. This is probably the game that made me realise that boardgames were not necessarily [i]Monopoly[/i]... and were therefore enjoyable.

Some obvious flaws in gameplay, but it's simple and it works. Admittedly, the nostalgia factor helps to hide the elephant in the room here ;)

manowarplayer recently asked me why this is rated so highly on my list. I own much better games than this, but my ratings are based on a want-to-play basis. This game gave me so much enjoyment many years ago that I don't think I would turn down the offer of playing it again. My ratings of the expansions is probably more in line with what other people would give this game.

A game from the GW era, where serious big boxes full of plastic miniatures where sold in the supermarket for Christmas!

This is an accessible dungeon-crawler, not-coop, think of it like the grandfather of Descent (kinda); very simple rules (rate: 6), but it shines with a stunning quality in the materials: monster & hero miniatures, furniture, dice, cards, board (well...that's ok), tokens, missions. Good (not exceptional) even by today standards.

This is probably one of the major foundations for my gaming today.

Sure, I got into "proper" gaming from playing with proper gamers just a few years ago, but this game was no doubt one of the major factors of my love for not just this hobby, but many other things in my life too.

Originally played my next door neighbours copy when I was maybe 8-10. This led to an interest in other friend's board games, leading to interest in my Uncle's GW hobby. He gave me his well preserved, UK version of this popular gem, as well as a copy of Warhammer 40K, and I later brought Space Hulk 2nd edition. These things led onto video games such as my beloved Warlords III: Reign of Heroes, then onto Bloodbowl, Magic: The Gathering, Mordheim, and then finally into the larger world of Board Gaming!

Having now played Descent (1st Edition & expansions), I prefer its meatier system with its larger choice of options for the evil player, heroes and weapons, but Heroquest still offers a perfectly acceptable game for lighter, less intense gaming groups. Causes a lot of laughs, which I always think is a good thing!

Shame it can be a bit of a slug at times, with roll and move system and a tendancy for the Heroes to walk through the level or die immediately (balance is tough on both sides).

Makes me want to try and get my group playing Descent 1st again!

HeroQuest is one of those special games that everyone should try, if given the chance. Yes, it has been overshadowed by games like Descent at this point, but if you want a D&D adventure in a game, this is one of the best, old school implementations of that theme. I really love the minis and components, which make for a very cool table presence. I'm at the point now though that if I'm going to play a game where I maneuver around and roll attack dice versus someone's defense dice, I would rather just play a role-playing game. Games like Zombicide with their super-fluid systems have made this one pretty obsolete for me.

So anyway, Dungeon master wipes us out, kicks our ass after an hour of torture, and says "This is fun, let's play again".  No thanks, I got a dentist appointment I'd rather go to.  
An evolution of D&D, but would like to try Descent instead.

Probably deserves a 10 for being the big daddy that kick-started it all back when I was ten.  Seeing all those minis and all that furniture with the massive board and cards and chits in just one box was the best Christmas present ever: all my fantasy dreams come true.  No board game since has come close to that experience.  But actually playing the game as an adult now?  It sadly leaves a lot to be desired.

Gets credit for really opening up board games to the dungeon crawl genre and it's a fun game by itself. It's not good enough to keep next to descent though.

Update--bumped up to 6.8 as I'm re appreciating just how good and pleasing the components are.

Thanks to a friend of mine, I've made some variants to the rules and made it more of a sandbox 1 vs all dungeon crawl. I've incorporated the components for Dragon strike into this game.

If you want a game up to date and with lots of unique mechanics, this won't be the game for you. This may be a great first game for someone but I think it just shines with the people who have already played it. Gotta love nostalgia.

This is one of the best family game dungeoncrawlers ever made. It has just the right amount of complexity vs ease of play and it is a game that holds up today as it did when it came out. This and Mutant Chronicles were two of my favorites from back then.

RATING: 10
PRO: This is the game I played and loved the most in my formative years. It may be the game most responsible for my obsession. So fun and easy to play. Toppest of top-notch components. All my friends loved it and always insisted on just one more quest. And that was possible - since the game made it so easy to create your own quests.

CON: Too awesome?

Descent-lite.  I used to love playing this game with old friends.  You take up arms as either a elf, barbarian, dwarf, or wizard.  After selecting your class you are thrust into a dungeon where the evil-wizard, depicted by one player, is trying to kill you with his armies of skeletons, trolls, and demons.  

The fights are simplistic and not very engrossing, but thats what makes the game flow more quickly than say, Descent.  Great fun for a 'lighter'-than-Descent dungeon crawl.

Admittedly, this was scored largely off of nostalgia. This is THE game that got me into gaming when I was younger. This is where it all began for me. I couldn't justify it as a 10, but it holds up pretty well all things considered.

RATING: 7
A solid 7 for nostalgia. Otherwise, the game seems a bit thin compared to games of today. Although the bits of furniture are an amazing touch. The first time I played it with my wife, she asked at one point: "And what does this table do, again?" "Nothing but make the game look cooler!" I said. She wasn't impressed.

Hit with the kids, though. I bought this game off ebay because the kids (5 and 4) always want to play Descent with me, but that game's too complicated, so I told them I'd get a game they could play. Heroquest was the perfect level for them (although I still dumbed it down a bit).

RATING: 7
An old classic - a thick barbarian, a robust gnome, a cunning magician and a quick elf have got to solve missions for gold and glory. So, they have to grope their way along murky dungeons (of course, in the beginning they can't see a bit of what should be on the board) and swipe away all the unfriendly creatures they might come across (orcs, goblins, zombies, mummies and other more extravangant creations).

The first missions are all quite oriented to pure strength: spells can help here and there, but for more magic the expansions are needed. Not that it matters - with simple mechanics (roll and move, combat without charts) the players delve instantly in the ghoulish atmosphere of the game. Here the material shines (especially the horrendously cute gargoyle).

For its easy ways and the possibility for players to develop their own missions, HeroQuest is possibly the perfect bridge between board games and role-playing games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A boyhood classic, and frankly a revelation to discover that I wasn't playing the correct rules when I was 12 (thought it was a bit hard...). I look forward to the nostalgia trip when we sit down and crawl out the original 10 adventures.

I loved this game as a kid...but its playability severely drops with exposure to other, better-conceived games...still a good game for playing with young teens, I would imagine. However, it's not well-balanced for the GM to win...so sessions are more like D&D than a competitive board game. I realize this may be the point of the game, but even so, my feelings regarding the game likely won't change.

Le coup de cœur de mon enfance.
Nous étions même arrivés à créer nos propres scénarios tellement nous étions à fond sur ce jeu.
Je rêve qu'un jour il puisse être réédité avec les mêmes illustrations, matériels etc.
C'était vraiment pour moi un vrai tournant vers tout ce qui est jeu de rôle et univers heroic fantasy.
De nos jours il y a pas mal de jeux qui ont repris le concept comme Mice & Mystics ou Descent pour ne citer qu'eux.

Παιχνίδι σταθμός. Το περίεργο είναι ότι εκείνη την εποχή είχε κυκλοφορίσει απο εταιρείες που βγάζανε διαφημιζόμενα παιχνίδια ευρείας κυκλοφορίας (MB και για την Ελλάδα το έφερνε η εταιρεία της bibibo, elgreco). Δεν ξέρω γιατί δεν συνεχίστηκε τότε αυτή η ωραία μόδα (heroquest, σταυροφορία του διαστήματος, ο θρύλος του ζαγκόρ, dragon game system). το συγκεκριμένο παιχνίδι ήταν η αιτία που αγάπησα τα επιτραπέζια. Ακόμα και τώρα δεν μπορώ να πω πως έχω παίξει κανένα dangeon crawl με την ατμόσφαιρα του heroquest. Δεν λέω το descent και κάποια άλλα ίσως να είναι ποιο "ψαγμένα" αλλά νομίζω πως το heroquest βγάζει κάτι το αυθεντικό.

RATING: 8
An excellent co-op experience.   With the right group of people you can have some fantastic fantasy bashes.  Nearly perfect for what it is, but I wish the board was modular, and the monsters had more action options. Still the base design is fun enough, and feel free to bend the rules to keep the play entertaining.  The combat system is simple enough to incorporate your own extra monster miniatures also.  It's fun but starts to get dry after a few sessions.

I wish I could find a group and be playing this more. Heroquest is a great, lightweight dungeon-crawl. 

For me, its a niche- for when I want/need a DM gaming situation. Like when you are playing with people that might not be 100% comfortable what to do otherwise. 

First game I was DM to two players. To balance it- I had them play Dwarf (Mike) and Elf (Edwin). To help balance, I gave the Elf two of the spell decks (earth and fire-seemed the best suited). Also-rooms with 3 monsters I scaled back to 2.

They barely, barely made it out alive, but they did. We all had a lot of fun for two hours.

Straight to the top of minis project of what to paint next.

I have Elf Quest printed, cards sleeved in box. Also have Barbarian and Keller's Keep expansions printed (not cut) in box also.

Hell yeah! Getting this game was pretty much admitting that I was a nerd, but I didn't give a fuck! That crazy looking dude in the furry underwear needed your help to kick some wizard's ass or some such, and he was gonna swing that sword the fuck around whether you stood with him or against him. I spent hours just looking over the different scenarios in the booklet. The expansion gave me even more reading material. I doubt that I played 3 full games of this, but I still consider it a classic.

Nostalgia. I loved this game growing up. It is what got me into adventure gaming. Before I played D&D I played HeroQuest. I intend on getting out my old copy and playing it with my kids in a year or two. Should be fun. Descent was supossed to be my adult version of this game, but it was not. I would rather go back and play HeroQuest.

This game is my childhood.  My dad was the DM.  I played the dwarf and wizard and my younger brother played the elf and the barbarian.  I got this for Christmas one year and I demanded that we play this as often as we could.  A few years back my little brother got me a second copy.  It is awesome.  No it's not the best game ever.  Yes Descent is probably a much better game, but I don't care.  This game still makes me happy and I intend to play with my kids as soon as they're old enough not to chew on the dice.  So many fun miniatures, and the furniture was great.  I don't know why, but it just made the flat board come to life in a way that other games haven't for me.

I thought it was okay, however for some reason it didn't grab me.  It had nice visuals, had some challenge, however for a dungeon crawl, I didn't like how you could only upgrade your weapons and armor in-between games.

Boring. Rigid player turn order often leaves some players unable to do things. Optimum move is to send barbarian to stand in all doorways and hit things until they die, so he should be P1. Also, wise players always limit the number of monsters on the board to avoid being swarmed, which means the Evil Wizard player has nothing to do.

It's a chore to play. Descent is much better.

This was the game we played at a local nursing home while slacking off from our volunteering work. It was FUN. Then Magic the gathering happened. Judging from my past experience, this game doesn't have that much of replayability (depsite being a modular board game). My brother was an evil DM once, trapped Michael and I in a room with 4 elites. When my brother successfully killed us, we quit the game.

I can still remember the absolute joy as a ~9yo when my grandparents got me this as a birthday present after we returned from a touring holiday and we hadn't seen them n 3 months. (My grandmother's brother owned the toy shop in the next town over when we were kids). And the extravagance of a $60 birthday present was .... yeah they were good times in the very early 1990s ..... :D

More geared towards older kids than say descent, but it's so classic and something I played growing up that I still love it.  I don't think i've really ever gotten to play a hero, but it's always fun being Zargon.  A five player game is where it's at, but it's usually just one person doing all four heroes, at which point it's impossible for Zargon to do much against them.  Still, a perfect game to introduce kids to RPG like boardgames.

A childhood classic for me. By nowadays standards the selling point would be the insanely gorgeous art of the game. Other than that, there would be hardly any other reason to touch it. But for the child-me this was the most awesome thing I ever laid my hands on. And to be honest, it kind of still is. Digging the somewhat abused box out from the closet (the child-me was clumsy and couldn't comprehend that the excitement for the game would turn into love and longing as the time would pass) still causes me to shed a nostalgia induced tear every time.

Shortly put, this was the game that made me the board game geek I am today.

RATING: 9
This game started me down the slippery slope to RPGs and D&D back when I was little.  I'd spend hours scribbling my own plots, designing dungeons and painting the figurines and then make my brother play it with me.

Has a soft spot in my heart (and I can still remember the dialogue from the TV advert: recorded to video during an ad break in The Empire Strikes Back, and thus watched over and over and over again during the 90s....)

When I was a kid this game was awesome. If I was 8 years old now, I would likely still think it's awesome. And in some ways it still is.
But I have to compare it to other games I know, well it doesn't stand out so much. A pure game from the 90's. Sadly I don't own it anymore. It will be missed. I give it a 6.

A nice, classic dungeon crawl. Good for a quick evening of fun, although balance issues are readily apparent in the first scenario(far too hard for the heroes) and later scenarios which are far too easy. A lack of character advancement aside from equipment is also problematic.

RATING: 8
Brilliant 'old times' dungeon-crawl game; the american version and rules are the REAL ones for playing in my opinion. Components are some of the best I've seen for a game of this genre. With a bit of imagination this game becomes endless (I've combined this one with D&D Boardgame).

Great classic and still the best Dungeon adventure around for me. Simple, fast enough, and almost always causes a bit roleplaying around the table. So playing is always fun, and doesn't take the whole evening, so you can play several quests, or have time to play something else too. And kids can play this too, so makes it easy one to bring to the table.

The game that turned me into a geek. I used to play games such as Risk, Monopoly or Trivia games before. I found this in a department store and was blown away. I played this with myself for hours and hours. I never got around playing all of the extensions and sadly, the game was destroyed in a flood (no joke). I will try and pick it up again and play it again. Compared to all those heavy games which are available today, such as Descent, HeroQuest is very simple, but this might appeal to younger people, casual gamers or gamer girlfriends. There is still a nice HeroQuest online community, with new quests, spells, monsters etc. available for download.

EDIT: Played the first three quests last night and the game is still enjoyable more due to nostalgia and novelty than gameplay. It is just too easy for the heroes to win, there is no real challenge in the quests. I think I will have to tweak this and introduce campaign rules to make this interesting again.

RATING: 5
This is a hard game to rate. On the one hand, I think this is a great kids game with really fun bits. On the other hand, as far as dungeon crawls go, this game is pretty dated and overly simplistic. Roll and move is a terrible mechanic, and there was a missed opportunity here to differentiate character classes via different movement rates. I don't think changing this aspect of the game would have complicated it beyond the understanding of the game's target audience.  Wild swings in luck can make this game especially brutal and can compound the player elimination problem. So on the whole, a great kids game, but adults will want to reach for any number of modern day dungeon crawls over this one.

One of my first boardgames, aside from the standardgames like risk. Played it for months everyday with my friends from school when I was about ten years old. A few weeks ago I played it again, i'm now 25, and i still liked, it wasn't as addictive as it used to be but ii's still fun. Easy to learn, fast play, although you have to be with at least 4 players otherwise some dungeons are to hard. Most fun is creating your own dungeons. For people who think warhammer quest is too complicated.

Approachable D&D without the acting and all the book keeping. Create custom scenarios and adventures. Watch characters grow and complete a full adventure. I think probably a land mark game for its time. Descent 2nd Edition is trying to capture some of what is here. The genius here was that 10 year olds were DMing for one another. I was 13 when I played this and many of its expansions. I got my 7 and 6 year old sisters to play the full campaign.

I was about ten years old when this came out, and there are no words that adequately describe just how much I wanted it at the time.

This is one of my favorite dungeon adventure board games.  My friends and I would sit for HOURS playing over and over, never getting bored and creating our own rules as we went along.  I painted more than half of my figures, and will eventually finish painting the rest when I have some time.  Its not a GREAT game by any means, would have been a 6 except for adictive factor, and expandabilty is massive by adding figures from any other game and designing your own game tiles.  I was tempted to push it to a 9.

RATING: 5
This is a classic.  However, it shows its age.  The Game Master is left with nothing to do unless the players have opened doors to reveal monsters.  And usually the games we play devolve into opening a room, fighting the monsters, searching for traps, everyone searching for treasure, searching for secret doors, and moving on to the next room.  After "fight the monsters" step, the GM just sits there.

However, what is great is the production.  Gobs of plastic monsters and props, cards for spells and treasure, and your very own Game Master Screen.

Ultimately, this game just makes me want to bust out with the Dungeons and Dragons Rules Cyclopedia and use the Heroquest props.

The best fantasy board game for sure, its the one that started it all for me. Simple play but endless hours of fun for all ages. Nice board design and miniatures, truly a masterpiece in my books. The whole idea of a Game System is what really did it for me. With expansions and the Heroes being able to continue from quest to quest. Although I may only have 20 plays recorded here I have probably played this game tone of times. Every quest of all expansions multiple times. I still don't know what it is about this game that gives it that unique feeling (could be the GW influence from Jervis Johnson)  but whatever it is I am glad it still has it for me.:)

This is a classic game of running through a dungeon to complete quests. It was one of the best games that I had played for the time that it came out. You have 4 players to play the heroes and 1 player that plays the evil sorcer.The heros have to complete quests and exit the dungeon.The game is revealed as you explore the board and you cannot see what is coming until you move around the dungeon.This brings back memories.

Pros: Fun Fantasy theme, Free form to develop your own quests and use imagination, game creates excitement as the board is slowly revealed.

Cons:rather fragile components. Some rules can be unclear. Really hard to find game, difficult game if you do not have the full player count.

My copy is so worn from playing this hundreds of hours solo when I was younger. I developed some extra quests and have toyed with variations to make it more complex for some time. This is one of my absolute top favorite games of all time! I'm very sentimental about this one. It's fun to develop variants for this, and I've found some great ones on the net.I just wish my game wasn't so worn down. I absolutely love the figures and furniture. Maybe we'll see a reprint someday...

&quot;Simplified&quot; is simplifying how minimal the game is.  No levels to gain, mediocre spells for killing beasties, lack of really nice treasure, and limited spellcasting abilities make this potential great idea into a mindless roll-fest.  Some interesting concepts, but no dimension.  Have yet to play with expansions, they may change things.  Not bad for a time waster/intro game for newbies.

I didn't have any problems with assembly.

But:

* The dice will wear out. Maybe seal them or just touch them up with black paint when the color wears.

* Make cards from the purchasable items. I just copied them onto stiffer cardstock and cut out the copies.

* Keep a record of what items players gained in which quest. The later quests get harder, but the quests don't give out starting equipment.

* Go find the internet HeroQuest sites! Plenty of additional material and quests. Much cheaper than buying the expansion sets.

* Paint the miniatures! Even a brown wash will bring out the fantastic detail on the sculptures. The skeletons and mummy are easy to paint. Base coat brown with white drybrush.

Have fun!

Another nostalgia powerhouse. We always found this game kind of frustratingly in the favor of the bad guys, though. Maybe we were just bad at it? We found this game to be obsoleted by Dragon Strike, which these days has been well obsoleted by Descent. Still, we had a lot of fun with this when we were 11.

Oct 2010: Started painting the figures, may play with my son when he's older. I missed out on this when it came out, because I was just old enough to consider it too childish. Also, I think it was pretty expensive then too, and I used to be a snob about plastic figures, preferring lead. I have since learned my lesson - plastic is much easier to paint. 

(Finished painting the minis Dec 2016, better late than never. I even fixed two broken weapons with wire and greenstuff.)

This is a fantastic game, which was and still is a great combination of boardgame and fantasy. And it was and still is so easy to invent new adventures, while waiting for the expansions. ;) Wonder why game manufacturers don't reissue such a game again, as there are so many people looking for it? On the other hand there seems to be some worthy heirs to the throne (probably Descent).

Heroquest appeals to me, in so many, many ways. Parts, graphic design, the simplicity of it... elements that endeared me to boardgames above the realm of the usual kids games we grow up among.

I'm waiting for a new Heroquest or Warhammer Quest game to be re-released. In the time since Heroquest, we have seen the development of several elegant game styles that could add their mechanics and produce a simple-to-play and deeply engaging figure-adventure game. I was hoping Heroscape would be it, but it's like comparing Unreal Tournament to System Shock or Deus Ex.

When pricier, less-visually appealing games like Nin-Gonost come out instead of Heroquest, I weep. Well, my wallet and my nostalgia weep anyway.

Hey, maybe in a year or two, we will see Hasbro release an affordable modular plastic-piece dungeon/wilderness romp, and dice will roll.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun game to substitute instead of a D&D night.  4 players, 1 DM, lots of dungeons, lots of monsters.  

Rules aren't too bad, the only gripe I have is that someone has to be the bad-guy, which is less fun than being an actual player.

Lame dungeon crawl. The pieces were nice for the time and the idea appealed but gameplay just is rather dull. Play an RPG instead or go for random stuff like Talisman. Might appeal to sub-10 year old boys who haven't played anything better.

I played this game many times in my late teens and enjoyed it immensely, but now find that is nice for a nostalgia trip, but not really as enjoyable as my memories of playing it.  I think this game would still be a fine choice for a pre-teen gamer even today though.

RATING: 7.9
Really fun game to play with the family, especially one's children.  I recommend a few "house rules" to improve game play such as fixed, or standard movement abilities for the Heroes (ex, Elf moves 10, Barbarian moves 8), as opposed to the completely silly dice rolls for movement.  We have Hero movement capability decrease proportionally with Body Points lost.

Quite simply one of the most awesome games ever.   A great dungeon crawl that is full of monsters, heros, fighting, spells, treasure!  Many Christmas Eve's were spent getting through the inital quest book.  Other than AD&D, this is was my first taste of a co-operative board game.  It simplies all the complicated AD&D rules and puts it into an enjoyable package for both kids and adults.  I can't wait until my kids are old enough for this.  I have all the parts, but none are painted.  I wish I had some expansions.  [Edit, I have the first Expansion thanks to an EBay purchase!]

My friends and i got hooked on this game when it came out. We would pull all nighters, playing through 3-4 quests a night. we zipped through the original game and two of the expantion sets before we dissbanded.

[b]First Board Game I Ever Loved Award[/b]

[b]Great Gateway Game Award[/b]

Still awesome. And still unreplaced, remarkably, since this was a cult-classic. But most modern dungeon crawlers lack either the sense of exploration,  the player vs player thing, or at the very least, 3d furniture. May feel a bit dated, but there's also something timeless about the hack and slash simplicity, exploration, and story telling

Downside is that optimal play by the heroes sucks the challenge out, and doesn't scale well for difficulty as the campaign goes on regardless

(3 Design + 5 Enjoyment)

I worry that my rating is simply due to nostalgia and youth - the last time I played this must've been a decade ago or more.  Even so, I DID enjoy it very much, and I have a feeling that I still would.  A fun game, with a theme that I enjoy.

Edit: I got the online version of the game, and got to see it in all its modern-day glory.  And...  yeah, not so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So, I'll admit that my rating of 8 is... slightly colored by nostalgia, as I played this game as a kid with my cousin and brother.  If I'm a bit less generous, I think it'd be a solid 7.

Cons:
-super generic and simplistic characters: the quest giver is literally named "Mentor", the characters are cliches
-a bit limited and simplistic, in that the only thing you're doing is dungeon delving... there's really no room for story or town encounters or character development as in D&D
-currently out of date/print
-dice are heavily biased in favor of the heroes (evil only gets 1/6 of each die for defense) [not a huge problem given the challenge level, but worth noting]

Pros:
-simple rules that are easy to learn
-levels get progressively more challenging, everything is pretty well-balanced (aside from the dice issue), and if characters don't work together, death can come quickly (for example, if you have a dumb, door-opening Barbarian, you could let out far more monsters than you can handle, or if you have a gold-loving dwarf, wandering monsters might easily break you down)
-huge opportunities for expansion and DM modification: easily craft new quests, items, rules, spells, etc.  Granted, it can be hard to scale these new creations unless you buy the now out-of-print and insanely expensive expansions; there are some websites that have the PDF versions of all of them, but access to the new miniatures?  Not unless you have a 3D printer.

This is a fun game that allows players to basically do D&D without doing D&D.  Easy to get into, no pressure as each quest is more-or-less self-contained, and rewarding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is very old stuff, so don't expect the depth of modern boardgames. But back in it's days HQ was the best you could get. It still has a lot of fans around the world and it's still fun. If you played it as a child, it will always give you back a piece of youth. 

I play the Dwarf!!!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I know this game is probably terrible at a technical level, and we've probably never played it correctly by the rules.  This is still my favorite game.  HeroQuest embodies everything I like in board gaming - co-op play vs a single player, exploration, tactical combat, character progression, min maxing decisions, thematic storytelling, and forgiveness for a fast-and-loose play-style to inject your own imaginative variations, all while keeping gameplay simple enough to keep the game moving quickly.  I'm still looking for a modernized system that takes these concepts further.  HeroQuest's main flaw is that the variation eventually plateaus after your characters has advanced to a certain point.  Weapons, character abilities, spells and artifacts, and monsters eventually fail to scale.  The GM needs to build this out using what's possible in the HeroQuest system to overcome these limitations.

RATING: 10
D&D light....very light. But still oozing awesomicity....my word. My first introduction to the world of fantasy and RPG's of any sort. This game will always hold a place in my heart and my collection. Is this mostly nostalgia? Absolutely, but the 10 isn't changing. So I guess you could say the score is 10... for an 8 year old me.

RATING: 7
A very nice game, you absolutely do not want to being a variant of the classic D & D as many may think. It definitely takes some of the settings and characters, but it all ends there. This is definitely another type of board game and certainly was created to give more immediacy to the games. The part that definitely penalizes is to have a single board with dials fixed and as far as you can vary the furnishings, the traps and the like, are in the long run has the impression of always playing the same game. However, if you have a good imagination, a solution can always be found! Certainly influence the roll of the dice is high and you are likely to see their hero perish before the completion of the mission. The thumbnails are very beautiful, so 'as the rest of the components of the game. Recommended highly for its immediacy and atmosphere. Not recommended for RPG purists and D & D.

My rating has a high nostalgia component, but I still like to play this a lot. With Talisman, this was the first game outside the scope of stuff like Monopoly and Risk I used to play. Fantasy adventure games don't easily get much better than this, without adding lots of complexity and playing time. I'm looking forward to play this with my children in a few years' time.

i got this for Christmas the year it was released. soon after i developed a hatred for orcs. it ultimately drew me into the world of RPG's.  soon began playing AD&D and rifts, gurps , Cthulhu, starwars rpg's.  the a strange new thing showed up the tcg.  magic the gathering.  so yea HeroQuest started it all for me. :)

For a time in my youth this was the only board game worth playing. I had all the expansions but never kept them. I bought a copy off ebay years later. Of course now I have descent and this is just collecting dust.

Mice and mystics covers the young ones.

Nostalgia though means I can give it lower than a 7.

I can't possibly count the times we stayed up late as kids to play this game. It was the perfect fantasy game at that time, however does loose some of it's charm when you get older. But during it's time, it was an excellent game.

Stored in original box with tons of printed extra material and purchased genius add-ons.

RATING: 7
This was very enjoyable back in the day and I played quite a bit of it.  It has many things that were very admirable, such as the way spells were done (still the best), and fabulous 3D furniture.  It really invented the modern dungeon crawl game.  However, it is now obsolete.  If the players play smart they will always win and a lot of the skill is all about trying to get through doors, so it is not very fluid.  Worthy of respect and even love, but now obsolete.

This is a fun, and simple game...excellent for kids and adults to play together, particularly with one adult playing the part of the GM.  There's quite a few new quests available made by fans which are quite good, and several which allow character progrssion as well.  If Descent takes too long, this might be what you're looking for!

Bumping this up another point.  It's been a big hit at our house, our 8 year old daughter loves it, and my wife enjoys it quite a bit as well

Picked up at a thrift store for under three dollars. Figured it'd be silly fun with Kevin, Amanda and Stephanie some time.

update: finally played this for a laugh and discovered what I suspected: had I had this when I was nine years old, I would have been over the moon. Now, however, it's just a catalyst of nostalga for those who DID have it at nine years old. Not worth playing unless you're in it for the memories. See: Talisman Effect. But, boy, is the furniture ever nice, eh?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Now why don't they make games like this any more?  I mean, it's got friggin' FURNITURE for Zargon's sake!  Okay, so maybe Eagle Games DID try to revive the epic, toy-filled board game but ended up going bankrupt (which is rather sad).  Anyhow, the furniture is awesomely fantastic and the plastic figures are fantastically awesome, however the rest of the graphic art (cards, game box, etc.) have a very cheesy '80s fantasy style which leaves me confused as to whether I should laugh or shake my head. As for game play, "HeroQuest" falls squarely into the category of "theme-rich, story-telling, experience games" which are quite simply fun to play (at least in my opinion).  I've got my wife and one of her best friends working though the adventures together, with myself taking on the role of Dungeon Master (a role I rather relish, since it allows me to tell a story and add in little special elements, all the while secretly rooting for the heroes and hoping they complete the quest - but not too easily!).  The danger of a game like this is that it can become repetitive - enter room, kill monsters, search for traps, disarm traps, search for treasure, repeat - but it seems to have enough strategy involving the positioning of heroes and the use of spells, and the quests are short enough, to keep everyone interested throughout.  And the suspense of the exploration is enough to keep the heroes on their toes!  At the same time, the game is very simple to learn and doesn't sink under its own length and complexity (Descent, anyone?).  All in all, this seems to be exactly the type of light dungeon crawl for which I've been searching for a while now.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

Classic Dungeon crawl game.  Loaded with good pieces.

RATING: 5
Heavy nostalgia attached to this one as I had it when I were a lad, though a lack of parental interest means I don't remember ever playing it much. I thought that Gargoyle was the coolest thing in the world.

As an adult, it's a too-light dungeon hack where 1-4 players control typical D&D stereotype heroes and the lucky/unlucky one gets to be a dungeon master, revealing the contents of the rooms heroes enter and managing the inevitable deaths of the monsters found there.

There's the kernel of a good game to be found, but the best thing about it is the presentation, with hobby-quality Citadel miniatures, including fantastic dungeon-dressing like weapon racks and an ancient sarcophagus. There are some things it does right -- the virtual impossibility of monsters successfully defending keeps things moving at a good clip -- but many that just don't work well, such as the rules for searching for traps and treasure or the busted difficulty curve.

It's possible to have good fun with, especially if you don't take it too seriously, but don't expect many actual decisions. I would be unlikely to choose it over e.g. Warhammer Quest or Claustrophobia.

I have spent many great hours playing this game when I was younger. The rules are simple (which is good) and I like all the componenents, but I think that there are plenty of things that would need tweeking (for example I think that most monsters should have more hitpoints than one). I also think that it&#039;s too straightforward.

My house rules (on version 6.4 now) have added character creation and advancement while trying not to change the basic simple and fun play.  Remember that HQ is NOT an RPG; expect one and you'll be dissapointed.  Its a boardgame; plan on playing it as such.  Used to love it, nowadays it seems very lacking.

This game brings back so many memories. Played it a ton of times as after school activity and even with my parents.
A game where you could actually move little plastic heroes around in a dungeon? Count me in! To me, that was unheard of back then, and while I'm sure the game has been outdone many times since then, I'd love to some day play it again. It's been lying untouched in my games stash ever since those days :(

Played this one and its first two expansions through a couple of times as a kid/teenager. It was a great adventure game experience, and the first of its kind for me.
Meanwhile, especially when compared to modern games of the genre, the rules seem to be a bit out-dated and game play too simplistic. - But it still holds great nostalgic value for me, and it is the perfect introduction game for the genre, as the rules are easy to learn.

It's not a perfect game, but it is pretty damn close. It is fantastic for getting non-gamers into playing dungeon crawlers. While there are "better" dungeon crawlers out there, the depth of rules can put a lot of people off. This game is so damn simple that ANYONE can play and have fun. I own everything for this game - the expansions are all amazing. I've added my own house rules which slowly role out during campaigns to add more depth to the game in bite size pieces for the non-gamers out there.

I don't know if I'd still be into playing this today, knowing all the scenarios and having no real desire to make my own. I'm not big into RPGs or fantasy stuff in general, but as a kid I was really, really into this game! So many hours and hours (days and weeks more like it) of fun!

Extremely biased with my rating here. loved Loved LOVED Heroquest. This game, along with The Hobbit, set me on my future path of rpging and wargaming. Heroquest was the earliest inspiration for me becoming a DM. The figurines, the setting pieces, the adventures, and the ease of play definitely let my imagination go wild and made me want to play more. Loved the dice, and I also loved how they provided blank maps for you to make your own adventures as Game Master. 

My only gripe is that for the 20+ years that I've owned the game, I should have taken better care of the pieces.

RATING: 5
(+~10 Plays before I started counting)

From the dark corners of my memory: This game hit for me a sweetspot. It is able to deliver an RPG experience into a group of players and the campaign book is amazing if you can play it straight with the same group. The 4 heroes are simple but play very different.

Someone has to play the bad guy however.. And the missions have predetermined set-up, so the bad guy is more or less restricted to throwing dice. Not to mention that playing through a mission once killed all the exploration of it forever, hurting replayability.

I'd give this a try once more, but my tastes in boardgaming have changed through time.

I absolutely loved this as a kid and perhaps it would score higher if you'd consider it a kids game. Its' strenghth and weakness is it's simplicity. It's easily accesable for a dungeoncrawler, but broken by actual tactical play.
I play it with my 7 year old now. He loves it.

Yeah, I probably shouldn't like this game this much.  I'm not much of a bits person, but the treasure chests in this game rock.  This is the great grandfather of descent, or the simpler shorter version of descent.  I wouldn't ever want to play with more than two, but I somehow suspect I may like descent okay with two as well.  Anyways, its a nice light beer and pretzels romp through a dungeon.  It may get old fast, but one play was fun and looking forward to my next one.  The right depth/complexity/length I'm looking for out of a game like this.  Maybe a bit more customization for the characters would be fun, but this works.  The balance between the DM and the heroes is way off kilt for the prebuilt scenarios, but its all in fun.

I got this game for X-Mas back in .. many years ago. I played it a few times but not much back then. After I now played Doom with som friends I rememberd this game so we tried it one time. I dont know how it works with expansions but the gamesystem seems very unfinished to me, not good. with some house rules or some exp. maybee it works I dont know.
I recommend people to buy doom instead.

Dungeon crawl game that is a lot less deep than an RPG. You have to start to make up new things to keep interest in this game fairly quickly. Good for kids, but not for seasoned gamers. The pieces and board can be a great thing to have around for other RPG sessions and whatnot.

Great base game. Simple mechanics that allow you to delve right into dungeon role-playing, story-telling. Definitely lends to house-ruling and customization. My biggest gripe is that after a number of plays I begin to feel limited by the board, which doesn't feel large enough to accommodate  the types of dungeons I'd like to design! Another one of those games where it's a true shame it's out of print. They should still be selling this and creating expansions!

A fine dungeon-crawling game, one that, at its peak, was the best available - however, now, it is somewhat dated and was basically surpassed in most ways by [thing=17226][/thing] (and the second edition of this one).

Still, in its time, I had some major fun with it.

This was a gateway drug for me and RPGs and I treasure my old copies (yes I have multiple ;) and have started playing it with my own and friends kids!

One wizard table even has the candles intact.

I am filled with nostalgia for this game, which got me simultaneously into RPGs and the wider world of board games. It manages to capture the adventuring career aspect of D&D while simplifying combat into small die rolls. There are some issues with adventurer balance over time, but those aren't a big deal and can be helped by adding other rules. Still a fun game.

My friends and I played this to death when we were younger.  We were (and still are) rabid about anything fantasy-themed.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't keep its luster past the early teenage years.  I remember the game being easy even when we played it a lot around age 12.  If the heroes know what they are doing, the Zargon/DM figure doesn't stand a chance.  I've tried introducing a lot of different ways to moderate the difficulty, but none of them clicked as well as the base system.  Would I play it if someone suggested it, or designed a scenario that is actually a challenge for the heroes?  Probably.  Do I have the drive to create my own?  Naw, not really.

A great game in theory.  I had some decent fun with this as a teen, and the production quality is an awesome thing.  

It's biggest problem is that it's a boardgame that really, really wants to be a roleplaying game.  I'd be much happier with it if it was set up with the monster controller (Zargon) actually being able to play full-out against the players, but it's just not that sort of game.

Oh gods, the nostalgia!

I have the brazilian edition by Grow (Grow? Estrela? Can't remember!). No miniatures. We had hard-paper on plastic stands miniatures =(

The dice wore off really fast, but my brother called Grow (or Estrela) and we got a new, wooden, set.

Those were the days, and this was the game. Give it your kids if you have the chance, and play a mean, mean Zargon. The game is kinda easy, but if you're a clever evil master than you can make things really, really interesting.

Very simple, but a ton of fun.  We role play a bit, but don't take the game too seriously, and I think that's the way to do it.  A story unfolds each quest making each one fun (and often funny) on its own, but the long-term goals (making it through the campaign, buying new equipment, etc.) keep the game interesting.

EL CLÁSICO de los juegos de miniaturas. Recuerdos, fantasía, imaginación, materiales excelentes y horas de diversión se funden en este juego fantástico de aventuras y magia. Con cierto regustillo al rol y muy abierto a los escenarios propios y personalizados, e incluso reglas nuevas. Con las expansiones de La Torre de Kellar, El Retorno del Lord Brujo, Los Hechiceros de Morcar, Contra la Horda de Ogros y La Compañía Tenebrosa. Con fundas tamaño USA 56x87mm.

We played HeroQuest a lot when we first got it but it didn't have enough strategy or depth to it to keep us playing. Still... with the expansions maybe we'd play more. We really really liked Warhammer Quest because we could all play cooperatively. Plus WHQ is REALLY hard.

Great game! --this was my first introduction to the table-top fantasy genre. Hero Quest blends elements of both D&D, and Warhammer Fantasy, and has a certain charm about it that the other two are really missing. I recommend Hero Quest for younger gamers as a good first look into fantasy role play. Probably not a good game for veteran gamers as its just too simple in comparison the other options you have. I'll definitely teach my kids/grand kids how to play this game!

Great dungeon crawling boardgame.  I love going shopping between adventures.  "I'll take the crossbow for 350, the helmet for 125, and the rest on a gift certificate."  My favourite character was the elf and my character lived for quite a long time.  I've used to play this with my girlfriend and her parents in high school, with my D&D group when we just wanted to hack and slash, and I dusted it off to play with my nephews and niece just about a month ago.  Great great game.  I would buy a reprint in a heartbeat.

A really fun game with some simple but effective mechanics. The great thing about this game was the cool miniatures and components that are included. The mechanics allow for some great flexibility and depth if you are willing to invest a small amount of time into the game. I ran this from its basic rules up to my own house rules that had ehanced versions of each monster as the players became more powerful. This game was fantastic and allowed me to create stories beyond the 10 initial quests and the expansions.

My absolute favorite! Great components, atmosphere, and rules so simple you can learn them as you play. Though it was designed to appeal to kids, there is a ton of room to add additional rules and create a virtual RPG using the simple combat and spell systems as a basis...or just play it as a light and fun dungeon crawl as intended. With several expansions and lots of fan-made quests available on line, it has enormous replay value. Nothing quite compares to HeroQuest in my opinion...and I now have all of the highly coveted US Quest Packs in my collection!

This is the game that I think subconsciously began my love/hate relationship with board games as a youth and why it took me so long to get back in to the hobby.

In a time when Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, etc. were king (kind of sounds a bit like today... but I digress), I bought this game as a kid as, not only because it appealed to my more sensible nature at the time (fantasy setting? tons of plastic figures? some crazy dude swinging a sword and some generally badassery happening on the front of the box!?!?!), it was also so much different than the "board games" that I knew about. It was a game that you actually "played" and it looked "fun".

Well... I might have got it to the table once or twice in total. Given the contents in the box today, I'd be surprised if I even played a full game. I personally don't think that it was for a lack of trying but more a function of the video game era and "unconventional" board games not being as popular as they are today... at least not in my area. Out of that, I think my general distaste for "board games" grew, because I knew that there were different things out there yet I was stuck playing the usual fare that was being peddled out there.

I'm happy that thing have changed though and that I've gotten in to the hobby now.

As it stands, in today's terms, the game does look fairly simplistic but I'm hoping to be able to play it with my kids in a few years to introduce them in to more "roleplay'y" games and more interesting board games in general. Hopefully this evolves in to them playing Descent as that game is looking destined to have a similar fate at the moment.

This is by far the best D&D style board game, the only problem is the obligation to have a player making the master thing, but it's a lot of fun an entertainment, and also the best way to introduce someone into the board games and at last in the roleplaying games. Now it could be a little older and there are a lot of alternatives like Descent or Warhammer, but in my opinion, they are trying to add an inneccesary complexity to this type of games.

Este es de lejos el mejor juego de mesa tipo D&D, el único problema es la obligación de tener un jugador haciendo de master, pero está lleno de diversión y entretenimiento, y, además, es la mejor manera de introducir a alguien en los juegos de tablero y finalmente en los juegos de rol. Ahora puede ser un poco viejo y existen un montón de alternativas como el Descent o el Warhammer, pero, en mi opinión, están tratando de añadir una complejidad innecesaria a este tipo de juegos.

Most beloved game in my collection. This battered old box has seen play every year for twenty-odd years. Played it to death when I got it as a kid. Drew dozens of new maps. Lost interest when I grew older--it's a kid's game at heart after all--but then introduced my younger cousins to it when they were old enough. We've gradually played through all the quests in the base game and the first two expansions, a few each year at family gatherings, over the last decade or so. This year we'll be tackling the Ogre Horde expansion. Yep, we're all gonna die.

An all-time classic, which triggered my interest for fantasy games and literature. I still use the 3D furniture in other games (such as RPGs) and really liked the

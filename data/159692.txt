RATING: 8.5
This is one of the slickest solo engines I've had the pleasure to use. Managing threats and growth while attempting to meet objectives prior to deadlines creates tension with each turn and keeps choices interesting.  If the theme interests you, this one is a must play.  Even if you aren't sure about the theme, give it a shot.  This one is a keeper!

I've never played Navajo Wars so this was a new system for me.  It's an excellent solitaire experience that delivers theme, tough decisions, and strategy.  There is randomness which does not detract and requires a good strategy to counter.  I look forward to more of Joel's designs.

Initial Impression: This game is First Nations history in a box. From the start you're presented with operational decisions which will steer the fate of your people. Do you spend your time roaming and hunting the bison, raid or trade with enemy tribes, plan for future seasons, or focus on preserving and developing your culture? The rules themselves seems daunting at first but with the included playbook and accompanying video tutorials the initial hurdles can be overcome. After one read-through of the rules, I was able to play the game referring only to the brilliant Player Aids. I find the AI system brilliantly simple to use and doesn't pull me out of my mental planning, as so many AI systems do. My first play has solidified my understanding of the systems, mechanisms, and rules. From here on out, I'll be enjoying the decision-making and storyline. The Comanche Empire was something I had no indepth knowledge of but I'm hoping that this game will give me a little insight into what seems like an interesting topic and period of North American history.

perhaps too challenging.  My understanding is that the Comanches were tough, however, in the game, even in the first scenario, it is almost impossible to win.  I understand wanting a challenge to the player, but this feels in no way like the Comanche I've read about.  Steep learning curve for a game that is not firmly based on reality.  However, it is fun.

First impression:
Artwork : the game is ''beau'' (french word for beautiful), high quality for the cards, the board feels the design similar to Navajo Wars, I would be prefer see more the landscapes behind the point by point (forest, mountains, rivers, hills) but I think the balance between the efficiency of the mechanism and the artwork is not something easy to choose.

Rules, Tutoriel, Player aids:
- After playing twice tutoriel, no need to read the Rule book because the player aids summarize perfectly the several step by step procedure.
-Battles : easy easy and easy, you roll a die and compare !!!
- Victory Check , If you compare with Navajo Wars , it is a gap between them. easy to catch the control territory.
-Instruction counters: more oriented fighting 
-Initiative: procedure simplify, no brain storming to choose to preempt or not 
-Enemy reactions: like NW, the more you fight, the more the enemy react : draw cup draw draw cup !!!!!!
-Counters: colored , less dark that NW counters, the meaning behind them is simple and make meaning
- Developpment cards: are helping to dive into History, I would like not playing a game like that without feeling the great history behind.
-Cultural Cards: I like NW cards Level 1,2 et 3 and the mechanism is kept, adapt to Comanche People.
-Gameplay, does Comancheria helps to dive into History .? I have read EMPIRE of the MOON and after watching videos on you tube about Comanches, Quannah Parker and its famous house with a star on the roof, Cynthia its mother, the famous Texas Ranger (yes , sorry but if you are a french , we know only on them the Chuck Norris serie TV), 
I can affirm that the game respect the History, 

CONCLUSION: 

Does the game better than NW ?
I don't kwow how to answer because the question doesn't make any sense for me.
Comanches et Navajos people were very different (read design note) and the game Navajo Wars fit with a first game design et for me , it fit with a new game 
which didn't exist at this time on 2013, the theme had not been well exploited before NW, only concentrated on Battles, Tactics and react.
The history was missing, the point of view from Natives was ignore.
							 to see from Indians is the key on this GMT series.
I can see the struggle to simplify the gameplay, to play it faster (one hour for a scenario , NW was 1h30 et more), the Victory Check on 2 sentences on a card !!!,
the game play is very strategic and need to think ahead, yes the dice factor is there but at this time of history, the life for Indians and Settlers was always on the edge, isn'it ?

Does Comancheria a Success ?
From the intent behind the gameplay as I can catch, I think yes :

History is there,
Gameplay is a success
Veyy good solo game
High replayability : one hour for a full experience with a lot of cards 

Does this game nasty ?
In NW, three Ceremony cards one after the others follow by an event card , the Victory Check could be catastrophic and compelling you to a Good medecine, that is nasty ...

Conclusion:
Buy it if you like solo mode and Indians...

This is not just a war game.  It covers the rise and fall of the people over 175 years.  The game mechanics allow you to feel the struggle of a very powerful Native American force on the history of the West.

Based on two play outside of tutorial. Very morish, and while I'm putting it away to free up the table after playing it twice back to back, I'm sure I'll get it back to the table soon. Really strong design, 'stickier' in terms of rules than Navajo Wars, which has elements that I struggle to remember to do when playing - Not necessarily easier to learn than Navajo Wars, but it seems to stay in my head while playing better, so I can see why GMT rated it complexity 4 to that game's complexity 5.

Notably it's one of the few co-op or solo games I've played that it feels like you're driving the game, with the game reacting to you, more than you playing reactive - The obvious comparison to Navajo Wars would be that by defaulting to giving you initiative so you always get a turn before the enemy gets a turn, a portion of the AP the enemy gets depends on what you do, as is if the enemy gets to do something for free, making the AI system feel more responsive, and allows the player to feel like they're in the driving seat while giving more or less push back depending on what you do. Which... Doesn't serve to make the game any easier, and if anything seems to make it a tad harder due to it being easier to over extend yourself.

This is not an overly complex game, although it is not anywhere near what I would call a light game either. Part of the beauty of a war game especially a solitaire war game is learning the game and taking the time to learn to play it right. This game has a lot of procedure but once you get your head around when you do what and why then the flow of the game is great. Really well supported great video by Joel, great play aids, as well as a fairly good walk through in the playbook. If you are a gamer that likes solitaire you will enjoy this. Just remember to spend time in getting to know this game.

Incredible seeming game once you get past the opaque rulebook. Although I love the way the different options to the player can represent different aspects of the tribal life, I think the game is completely broken by one aspect: Cultural Attack. Very gamey, and ruins great play sessions. Honestly, I should rate this game a '4', but the fantastic theme and research done for this game, and otherwise great mechanics can't let me rank this that low. I would consider house-ruling the Cultural Attack, but I think the whole balance is based on that being a "thing", so I'm at a loss.

RATING: 8
Hyper-procedural game.  But once you get past through not-so-easy learning process you will be ready to enjoy the challenges the game throws at you.  And you WILL be thrown at.

First game will be spent mostly on mastering the rules and discovering dependencies and possibilities offered by the game.  So failures will leave you unbothered.
Then you will realize that the game is difficult to win and even the 1st (Easy level) scenario presents a realistic challenge.

The beauty of the game lies in coming up with short- and mid-range plans leading you to the fulfillment of set goals.  But the game reacts to your actions and you need to constantly adjust and ease the pain.

Replayability looks very well despite you might work out a few optimal moves for the opening.  But very very quickly the game takes different direction every time and you are faced with different obstacles even at very early point in time.

The only issue I have with the game so far is randomness manifesting itself in strongly punishing sequences which appear out of nowhere.  I.e. you look very safe at some point and then suddenly a quick cumulation of unfortunate die-rolls/events puts you in a very dangerous position in an instant.  There should be some build-up of the threat in time...  I'm not saying it happens always, but it happens _sometimes_ and can ruin a few hours of a good play.  I'll monitor this issue in future games and I'll see if it's as bad as I present it or - with growing experience - I'll find ways to deal with it.

All in all I'm very pleased with the game so far.  Definitely not a miss.  A very good choice for solo play.  An engrossing experience, both in terms of a gameplay as well as an ambiance.

EDIT: Hmm... the game is very long even after mastering the rules and strategic options.  It would've been fine had the game been exciting all the way,  but I sense too much of tediousness and repetitiveness within one game.  To be monitored... 

EDIT 2: The 4th game (2nd scenario - 'Rise of Empire') witnessed very strange and disturbing sequence towards the end.  I was doing endless Planning actions moving my rancherias to avoid powerful enemy columns until they weakened.  Nothing else made sense to me as I had victory conditions fulfilled.  This sequence was long, boring and felt very gamey.  Another issue to keep tabs on...

Coming from Navajo this is a similar gameplay experience and as usual the basic 'tools' of : heavy learning curve, super heavy procedural gameplay and you need to invest many hours to enjoy a full game even in the short scenarios all exist here. This feels more like a brain excercise than a pleasant boardgame feeling. Its a solid solo game i dont doubt that its just that time is scarce and i own many other boardgames that waiting to be played.

For non-wargamers, the rules are harder than the game play. Rules language is tough to interpret.  Finished/unfinished, is game about Indians or furniture? Operations & Actions & actions points are at first hard to tell apart. Paraibo, Mahimiana. Whats wrong with war chief or tribal chief? A Lot of Steps, that really are not steps. They are procedural options.  GMT game, so not surprising.  Game is mainly for their war gaming clientele. The games story-play is fun.  I just fake my way through and still have fun losing !

I held off on this at first because I am not that interested in solitaire games. Turns out there is a lot in this box. It has great theme, great feel, and it has inspired me to learn more about the Comanche nation. Moreover, it's a great game -- at first I felt a little bit helpless, but as of my 5th play I can see differing strategic options and can respond intelligently to the AI actions rather than feel entirely at the mercy of the Success cup. Kudos to Joel for a great game.

It definitely has something, since it jumped ahead of several games to get to the table immediately.

Oh my God, this game is looking great.  Played my first go at the early scenario Feb '17.  I was rocking, great leaders, two bases and two territories: only had to survive another turn or so.  Then, bam, here come the Spanish.  No problem, I had some time to build up, right?  Crap!  An ambush card!  They tore into my main party with a five strength army and totally wiped me out.  What was left was so weak it succumbed to the harshness of the old West.

What an awesome AI!  What a story was told!  I almost started a second game right away.  This is great stuff...a bit easier to negotiate than Navajo Wars, I think.  This rating may even go up!

I'm glad I got to try this, as I missed out on Navajo Wars, and was very disappointed that I never got to play it. Comanceria is a supposedly streamlined version of that game's system, and while the game is fairly straightforward once you get the rules down, I felt like there were just too many things to keep track of. It sort of reminds me of Victory Point Games' State of Siege series, but much more free form. The theme is fantastic, and I love how well the game makes you feel like you are managing a Native American tribe that is hunting and raiding. In many ways, this is a fantastic design. I'm just not sure I got out any more than what I put into playing it.

Probably the toughest game I've ever had to learn - and I learnt Neanderthal and Pax Renaissance off the bat last year! Eventually won the introductory scenario on the fifth attempt (and various mangling of the rules). 

On the one hand it is an incredibly well designed game. The AI is fantastic - you really do get the feeling your empire is under threat and the Spanish (in my case) are closing in quickly as their settlements expand. Culture loss was my downfall. It is just a great history lesson and such a smart design.

I took a while to rate this though. It is not an easy game to playthrough. I think it's the repetition and procedural nature that can sometimes feel like a lot of hard work. I can only play this in 45 min sessions as a result. Really enjoyed these sessions, but I'm wondering how many of the latter scenarios I can face with the thought of a loss after 2-3 hours of play. 

Would make the most sensational iOS game ever, as you wouldn't have to deal with enemy AP resolution or the procedural nature of the game. This is getting better as my creaky memory gets itself into gear, but it'd be lovely not to have to manually shift all the levers throughout the game.

Comancheria The Rise and Fall of the Comanche Empire 1700 to 1875    Board Game Review.  Publisher: GMT   Game Designer: Joel Toppen   Price  $60.00

Passed Inspection: Beautiful components, mounted map, perfect for solo play, unique subject matter, on-line support, elegant game system, excellent value for the price, good tutorials included, duplicate counters included in case you lose some
Failed Basic:  Some rules are a little confusing

In 2013, GMT released Joel Toppen’s stunning Navajo Wars board game.  It was an Armchair General top game of the year!  (http://www.armchairgeneral.com/navajo-wars-boardgame-review.htm).  Now Toppen releases an eagerly awaited sequel which looks at the “Lords of the Plains” – the Comanche people.  Comancheria takes Navajo Wars to whole new level and improves the design making it easier to learn and play while keeping the dynamic story telling experience of the original.  To write this review, I played a linked campaign covering from 1700 to 1799.
Per Wikipedia, the Comanche “emerged as a distinct group shortly before 1700, when they broke off from the Shoshone people living along the upper Platte River in Wyoming. In 1680, the Comanche acquired horses from the Pueblo Indians after the Pueblo Revolt. They separated from the Shoshone after this, as the horses allowed them greater mobility in their search for better hunting grounds.  Comancheria, the former territory of the Comanche including large portions of Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.
The horse was a key element in the emergence of a distinctive Comanche culture. It was of such strategic importance that some scholars suggested that the Comanche broke away from the Shoshone and moved southward to search for additional sources of horses among the settlers of New Spain to the south (rather than search for new herds of buffalo.) The Comanche may have been the first group of Plains natives to fully incorporate the horse into their culture and to have introduced the animal to the other Plains peoples.  From Natchitoches in Spanish Louisiana, Athanase de Mézières reported in 1770 that the Comanches were "so skilful in horsemanship that they have no equal, so daring that they never ask for or grant truces, and in possession of such a territory that... they only just fall short of possessing all of the conveniences of the earth, and have no need to covet the trade pursued by the rest of the Indians.
The Comanche never formed a single cohesive tribal unit, but were divided into almost a dozen autonomous groups, called bands. These groups shared the same language and culture, and rarely fought each other."
Comancheria is a solitaire point-to-point style game.  The player controls the Comanche during one of four time periods (1700-1749, 1750-1799, 1800-1849, and 1850-1875) or in a campaign which stretches from 1700 to 1875.  Each time period has its own unique feel as the goals of the Comanche and their enemies change and evolve.
The beautifully designed, fully mounted map covers the American West including modern day Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.  The area covered is much greater than Navajo Wars and the map for Navajo Wars would fit many times within the Comancheria map.  Each of the six territories is divided in to six areas plus the Palo Duro Canyon which provides a shelter for war bands being hunted by their enemies.  The threats to the Comanche depend on the time periods but include other tribes, the Spanish, the Mexicans and the Americans as well as diseases and natural disasters.
If played from the 1700s, the Comanche have one Rancheria which is a sort of encampment made up of tents or teepees.  The Comanche were a wandering people so their encampments could be packed up and moved if they needed to extend their territory or move closer to the herds of buffalo which made up a large portion of their diet.  The Rancheria starts with a limited number of war bands which are rated for their combat skill and their movement speed.  The greater the combat skill of the band, the larger the band but the slower it moves as a unit.  It is important to steal or breed horses to add speed to the war band’s movement. Each Rancheria also has a “Mahimiana” and a “Pariabo” and each has a chart which shows how powerful their “Medicine Ratings” are.  The “Mahimiana” is the man who leads the hunts and coordinates or leads the war bands in their fights against their enemies (either Native American or Western) while the “Pariabo” leads the civil affairs of the Rancheria.  Game turns are an abstract amount of time which can be from 1 to 20 years.  As the turns progress, there is a chance that a leaders of the Rancherias will age and die.  Their powers may go up or down. 
Each Rancheria is also tracked for the skills of its people, horses, buffalo collected, other foods, trade goods, captives taken and guns either stolen or traded from other factions.
The overall ratings of the Comanche people are tracked by their ratings in culture and military prowess.  If the culture or military ratings drop to zero, the people are defeated and the player loses the game.
The mission of the player is to find ways to increase the culture and military ratings of the Comanche while expanding the number of Rancherias and fighting off or allying with the other tribes and Westerners.
The artificial intelligence (AI) of the enemy is dictated by a clever sequence of war card draws with varying movement and tactics plus a series of chits displayed on the Enemy Instructions Display Tracks.  Each column on the track covers the enemy coming from each cardinal point direction – North, South, East and West.  If there is no enemy for that direction during the scenario played, the chits for that direction are not used.  The chits are moved around the track and based upon a die roll may flip over which could take an enemy order which could help the player in to a result which could hurt the player.  In my over 7 hours of playing the first two scenarios, the AI never felt arbitrary or illogical.  In fact, during the second scenario with Spanish forces approaches my primary Rancheria from the West, it got downright nail biting!  Not having the war bands available to fight the large Spanish army, I ended up trading captives I’d taken a few turns earlier for the withdraw of the Spanish forces.  Then, as the army began to lose strength on its march away from the Rancheria location owing to a general decline in its supplies, I ambushed it with war bands from both its rear and its front!  After several rounds of battle, the Spanish were decimated and I reclaimed my previously traded captives.
The turn sequence of the game is very complex with many alternative steps depending on the actions taken by the player and the AI.  Luckily, the designer thoughtfully includes handy player’s aid cards which then reference to the instructions for more detail.
Each turn is made up of four phases – the War Column Phase, Operation Selection Phase, Operation Execution Phase and the Operation Cleanup Phase.  In addition, a Passage of Time Phase may be initiated by certain conditions.
The War Column Phase is the phase where War Cards are drawn which gives the enemy special instructions.  If enemy forces are in the same area as Comanche war band or Rancherias, battles may occur.
The Operations Selection Phase procedure allows the player to either take an action, raise his or her culture points, plan for other actions such as improving the medicine ratings of the leaders or moving a Rancheria, or take a Passage of Time Action.
The Operations Execution Phase allows the player to act on what he or she has picked in the previous phase.  When a player takes an Action, he or she can move war bands, hunt, trade for goods or raid an enemy tribe or Western power.
Success checks are handled in a very unique manner.  Success chits are put in a cup or bag.  Chits are pulled out and revealed.  The chits include “Success” or results which give the enemy Action Points.  The enemy Action Points are accumulated on a space on the board.  During the Operations Clean Up Phase, these chits give the enemy forces extra actions to perform based upon the point cost of the chits on the Enemy Instructions Tracks.  When the player has a success, these chits are not immediately put back in the cup but can be used to increase the medicine rating of the Rancheria’s leaders.  When the enemy takes an action, the enemy’s chits are put back in.  This process results in the enemy getting more action and become more wary of attacks by the player based upon the number of raids and battles the player conducts!  This is a brilliant and elegant process for having the enemy react to the increased aggression of the player!  Positively brilliant!  Also a duplicate set of Success Chits are included in case you lose some! Nice thinking on Toppen’s part!
The player can use Action Points to purchase Culture Cards which boost certain aspects of the Comanche.  These cards can increase the general horsemanship of the tribe or give them easier access to guns or even give them a greater degree of spirituality or negotiating skills with other tribes.
Development Cards add random events such as plagues, multi-tribe alliances, greater hostility with neighboring tribes, etc.
Some Development Cards can be paid for with Action Points in order to take the card in to the player’s hand for use later.
The Passage of Time Phase moves the game ahead by years. During this phase, tribal leaders age and may die; populations increase or decrease; new Rancherias are created; Bison herds move across the plains; Victory Conditions may be checked.
Some of the steps can be confusing but the Player’s Aid Cards help as does the Tutorial Book and the various on-line resources such as Toppen’s YouTube® tutorials.
To call this a game is a bit of a misnomer, Comancheria is really a full blown simulation which includes tribal management, warfare, religion, etc.  It is also very educational and illuminates the lifestyle of the Comanche people over two centuries.   A complete scenario can be played in as little as four hours.
I found this game to be very addictive and fascinating.  Playing it almost put me in a zen-like trance as almost all outside distractions fell away while I tried to save my tribe’s culture and expand its territory.
Comancheria is easier to learn than Navajo Wars but, while sharing a similar system, felt much more dynamic.  I love both games because they weave different narratives of the struggles of Native American people in the face of both internal and external threats.
Comancheria is one of my top games of the year and maybe of all time.  Playing it is a wonderful experience!

A more streamlined and approachable version of Navajo Wars. The Comanche are initially on the offensive, which is cool. Rules, Charts, and Tutorial are all very well done. I prefer the NW map better, but this one is functional. Play tells a strong narrative, and engrosses the solitaire gamer. 

A very solid and nicely executed release,

The theme sounds interesting and being based on the Navajo Wars system sounds interesting, too. Especially since this is supposed to even refine and streamline that system. So far only a tutorial game and man is this procedural. But it feels great, the enemy AI gives a great mix of predictability and surprise and the success cup is a great way to model agression-feedback. Love it so far!

While Navajo Wars had greater granularity in it's historical view & mechanisms, I think Joel has succeeded in achieving more simplicity & flow while maintaining a gutty, sky-is-falling game experience that honors and teaches the lessons of suffering & loss in the colonial expansion into the plains of North America.

Trust the constraints you discover at the beginning. There's all sorts of inflections to exploit. And don't be so quick to raid away those success chits from the cup, tho your war chief & Paraibo become powerful, or come time for the reaction sequence there will come a wave of hurt. 

In my current game, I am finding much greater success in immediately going with Politics & then Diplomacy, tactics that mitigate raiding to a very bare minimum & a strategy that forces a peaceful exclusion of the Colonial expansions and the active decimation & control of other tribes. And I confess to little niggling uncertainty if this is more about porting a similar cultural card 'spread' from Navajo Wars into this game than that the Comanche were skillful diplomats as I understand they don't situate so in their relations with other powers & tribes.

Excellent, although I'm still getting a feel for the game. The tutorial game was a great help, as a rulebook of procedures can be a bit overwhelming on a first read. I enjoy the procedural nature of the game, and look forward to the day when I don't need to reference the player aids as often, which shouldn't be long due to the smooth and thematically-appropriate gameplay. 

I enjoy the interesting A.I. system, the enemy instructions seem like they will keep things interesting and varied from game to game. And there are so many options players have at their disposal when it comes to commanding Bands and Rancherías, it certainly seems that several games will be necessary to fully appreciate this game. I look forward to exploring it further, and wish I'd discovered NW years ago.

I suspect that I will lose every game of this forever, but it is an outstanding wargame that is solitaire and feels less of a puzzle and more like an actual game. when playing historic games, I often ask "whose history is this". It's appreciated to see a people's history instead of a "top-down" approach in gaming.

This gets called a wargame but it's really more of a solo 4x game, tech trees, empire expansion and all. And a great one at that! Highly thematic and strategically challenging with plenty of ambiguous decisions.

Unlike many solo games where you're simply reacting to what the game throws at you, the enemy "AI" in Comancheria gets more actions the more aggressively you play, giving it a nice "risk and reward" aspec" and giving you lots of agency.

Also love how the game maps an arc from being the more or less unchallenged "lords of the plains" to desperately defending your dwindling lands against colonial forces. An interesting and thematic reversal of the usual 4x trope of escalating power.

Chances for a sudden death are even higher than with Navajo Wars. The rulebook is much improved and the mechanics, especially Enemy actions, are more straightforward. Unlike with Navajo Wars, the player aids are enough to play the game and after learning, the rulebook is not often needed during play. Again, each play creates a narrative which feels properly historical. If you like games that are easy to play but difficult to win, you'll like Comanchería.

1st Historical Period: Compared to Navajo Wars i find that the game encourages me to be much more aggressive and expansive. That in itself gives the game a completely different feel. In NW you feel you are on the defensive from the start. The actions and their consequences in Comancheria are easier to understand making it more accessible and easier to get into. Also the time length is significantly shorter. Although this is still a very procedural game i find that with each game i rely on the rulebook/charts less and less. I never managed to reach this point with NW due to its complexity and length.

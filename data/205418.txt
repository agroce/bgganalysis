So far I prefer All creatures but I think K likes this one better. It will get in the rotation!
After a few more plays we are seeing more 'depth' or at least possibilities to victory. Very enjoyable and most importantly quick game!

This totally hits the sweet spot for me. Believe it or not, I've never had occasion to play the original Agricola, but don't really feel I need to now that I own this. My wife isn't into heavy Euros anyway. Aesthetically, this game really pops with all the glorious "cropples" and "animeeples". So much to do and think about in such a short space of time, and I love how with each round, new locations and options get unlocked. The first imperative is to build up a reliable, ongoing food supply that will keep your growing family fed. You'll find yourself worrying about things that actual farmers would worry about - with the exception of water (unlike in other farming games, irrigation doesn't figure into Agricola at all). At the end of the game, beholding the family farm you created is extremely satisfying, regardless of whether you've won or lost. Makes for a wonderful solo game too.

I'm thinking about maybe getting Agricola: Family Edition. I feel like it is much more accessible than Caverna while still not being punishing like original Agricola (I'm not a fan of punishing games). Plus I love the pink family!!

Except maybe it IS as punishing as Agricola...

Very recommended for its target audience: families and newcomers! A much better choice than Agricola, even the revised edition from 2016. This Family Edition plays faster, has a better rulebook and is way easier to get into. One could surely argue about how much they've "dumbed down" Agricola, but who cares about that? Again, this is targeted towards a whole other audience.

All the angst of Agricola without the cards, stone and vegetables.  Much cleaner and more efficient in terms of table space.  Inexcusable rules issues.

RATING: 7
Very reminiscent of the full game. More so than all creatures, and can play 4. It's a wider more varied game than all creatures with less fiddly/ dynamic scoring, which is probably a good thing considering that this is aimed at the family. Though that's a family who plays games routinely and are all over ten. Fixed set up may be problem for some. But short play time and low rules overhead make this an excellent family weight game, of sub Stone Age-like complexity (actually it's better than Stone Age). Recommended.

Popular turn-based resource management game, made in a lighter and faster version.  Retained all the interesting player actions from the original (i.e. farming, building, eating your furry friends) without all the complexity of player cards.  Down time for each player can still exist.  As a solo experience seems to have some limited replayability, but with a group of up to 4 this promises to be a cute and fun game for the family.

Played once. 3 players including an 8 year old. Not sure there will be enough variation in play to see it getting lots of plays but certainly good for a few games. June 2017

*UPDATE* Played a 2 player game with my 20 year old gamer son. Competitive fight. I wasn't expecting such a full on experience from a family game. I have upped my rating. I do still stand by my comment that each playing will ultimately feel similar but I can live with that. I am glad I brought it. June 2017

I actually prefer this more streamlined version of Agricola over it's previous iterations. I think it gets players to the most fun parts of the game quicker than it's heavier-weight siblings. If you enjoy building the farm more than the depth of revised Agricola, I recommend this version. Totally suitable for new gamers all the way to experienced strategists.

This game has really grown on me - the scaling of the board with increasing numbers of players was excellent, and I have found it enjoyable in 1,2,3 and 4 player iterations. It's not as complex as Agricola, or as simple as All Creatures... but it has a lot going for it, and I now don't know if I want to buy the step up - maybe I'll just go for Caverna or A Feast for Odin instead!

I've never played the full version of Agricola, and I've only played All Creatures Big and Small on the Android app. I definitely like this better than ACBaS, as you don't have to fiddle with fences. As far as full on Agricola goes, I've always felt that game would be a bit too heavy for my gaming group/family. This game strikes a nice sweet spot as a Euro that I can bring out for my gaming group and my kids but is not too overwhelming to teach and play.

This has been a great first foray into gamer's games for our family.  The game itself has no text.  My kids understood the rules very quickly.   Both children (9 and 7) can play their own games, while the adults have some decisions to chew on.  My kids love it and it would be a 10 for them.  I have no major gripes.  Note that the 45 minute play time on the box is unrealistic- I'd say it's about 20-25 minutes per player.

As an Agricola purist/luddite, I have struggled with the iOS implementation because of its fancier graphics, which are sort of replicated here. But I think they have done a great job of simplifying the game in the right way. All of the core mechanisms are here, and the challenge of feeding your people is still an omnipresent threat. But the way certain rules were streamlined was a refreshing surprise that makes it much easier to play Agricola with your kids.

You can definitely use this game (and the 2-player version) as stepping stones to groom budding Agricola experts!

Found the proper game too card-driven, yet I love card-driven games. Think it's because the professions are unthematic and the improvements too fiddly. And the whole thing becomes overwrought. By contrast,  Family Edition is just the trick. Fuller than 'Gric All Creatures Big & Small (which I also have and love) but not as heavy as its big brother (and no cards!).

RATING: 7.4
Accessible to almost everyone - quite fun, quick (no more than an hour after learning), & fairly simple! You wouldn't want to play it every week. The game is much better than a filler. Obviously, it's not for those who like regular Agricola or Caverna. Its replay-ability is likely not super great in a long run. I paid nearly full retail($42, over priced for what it is IMO) with a gift card.

Simplified, streamlined but also refined version of Agricola that does away with the cards in favor of a more accessible game for families to enjoy. One point for everything means you can focus on whatever you like, bake bread whenever you feel like it means the fireplace is no longer dominant, family growth is no longer the dominant strategy as if you focus on that too much then that guy who got early pastures and sheep will likely have more points than you! Renovating is now a viable early option due to reduced clay room building costs so you can now spend that wood on more pastures.

So many positives within this family version that they make me wish they'd make a Agricola 2.0 with all these gameplay improvements but still have the cards and then that really would be the ultimate edition.

Solid version of Agricola. Now there's of course the question: why would I want to play this? My son can play full Agricola, so I'd prefer that. For a quick game, there's Agricola: ACBAS; that may only support two players, but I usually play Agricola with two. Given a group of non-gamers eager to give Agricola a go, this would be my first choice, as this is so much clearer than the original game. That, however, is something that doesn't really happen, so I have no need for this edition.

Still:

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> [b]4[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]This may be an okay game for families new to the hobby, but I'd suggest getting your feet wet with other games and then buying regular Agricola and playing the family game. I found the decisions to be too obvious and the strategies you can explore are very limited. Even though Uwe Rosenberg is my favorite designer I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Agricola: Family is great for what it provides which is a very light introduction to WP games that is perfect for families. However; if you have any experience with other WP games you may be disappointed with Agricola Family (as I was) because it is extremely with very few meaty decisions to be had, this is due to there only being a handful of end game buildings that generate victory points. Basically you have there are three paths to go down, animal husbandry, growing crops and hoarding resources.

My disappointment was due in large part to some folks commenting that Agricola: Family sat in between the original Agricola and Agricola: All Creatures in terms of depth. With expansions, Agricola All Creatures offers a much deeper game than the family version so I'll just stick with that if I want a quick Gric fix. Unfortunately that means if I want to pursue my favorite strategy of growing crops I'll need to play the full game.[/i]

1 play, 2er

What a great simplification of the original game! That game was a bit too stressful, with the feeding step always looming and the almost overwhelming need to diversify, at least a little. It does away with the cards and carrot/stone resources (and stone houses), and greatly streamlines the build costs (actually seems somewhat elegant now!). I love the easy way to score, too, vaguely reminiscent of Small World: every piece of cardboard, every animal, every grain in the fields is worth one point, and you get no negatives for missing some stupid type of thing! All this while managing to keep much of the feel of the parent game. I enjoyed this version so much more!

A really enjoyable, simplified version of Agricola. It actually ended up being slightly more of a challenge than we expected: my gaming partner made the rookie mistake of actually forgetting to feed her people.

There was a couple of rules that needed clarification (an odd thing for Mr Rosenberg, especially considering the lighter weight of this game).

But that's a minor thing. This is a really good family version of the game that will be enjoyed by gamers as well. The only downside is the lack of variable setup.

The best gateway game for worker placement mechanic by far: it is thematic (and farming is a neutral topic - haven't met anyone who dislikes it and animeeples are perfect for those looking for cuteness). Rules are simple, but the game makes you think a lot. Production is stellar and overall the game is worth its price tag. The only negative is a lack of variability. Hope it will change soon with an expansion.

Streamlined Agricola, but not that much easier compared to the original game without the cards. Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is also competing on the same slot.

This is an excellent variant of the original, very useful for playing this game with children as young as 7. My son really loves this and he has improved his point collection potential considerably. This game puts to the test all manners of skills for children, starting from the ability to count inside their heads, to making long term plans and seeking out the best possible choices for them to come to completion. My son was really happy to improve his score from 25 in the first game to 33 in the second. Recommended!

Actually enjoy it more than the regular edition, significantly simplified, but still requires careful planning and mindfulness of what your opponents are doing. 8+ and 45 mins is a bit of a stretch in our experience, more like 10+ and closer to an hour, esp. if 4 are playing. One thing for developers, in 4 person games the sheep provided (including the supplement markers) run out. (edit - no issue with number of sheeples, we were playing it wrong, using full game rules for animal breeding)

I am not an Agricola fan even if I do appreciate it.
AgricolaFE is a simplified version but it's NOT a family game in the same category of, say, a Queen Family Game. It does leave several aspects of Agricola but it preserves a good depth, tough decision, good flow. In a very short time (45 min) you get an interesting game.
0.1 less rating just because I can't understand how to play it well: it's lame but it's the truth.

Thoughtful and successful paring down of the original into a shorter play and more accessible game without losing the familiar feel that still presents challenging and engaging decisions.  I never get a chance to drag out the full original any more. This reasonably scratches the euro farming itch and I use the iOS game when I want the full Monte.

Great family / introductory game, my 8 and 9 year olds love it.
Despite no randomness it is very replayable in the multi-player format. As your options  are impacted by other players choices and taking the Rooster (determines who starts). Every multi-player game is different (3+ players).
1 or 2 player games however would have limited replayability.

This is a hit with the family. Most of the stuff you love from Agricola, without all the stuff people who don't like Agricola hate, in an easy to play package with great components. Would give it an 8 if the buildings were variable. Still might be an 8...

I'm not fond of Agricola, but this getting rid of the cards made it better. Haven't actually tried it with my family yet, seems like there's still a little too much going on than what they're used to

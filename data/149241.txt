This game is a ton of fun. Played with a group of 4. The first time, the first battle did us in. The second, we got to the second battle.... Soooo close to defeating the boss, but as they say, close isn't good enough.

Replayability: looks to be very high.
Artwork: awesome, humorous and very different (and for those of you who want good female representation, there is a male and female version of every character)
Time commitment: very long. You need a solid chunk of time to play this, but time just flies once you get going.

Never have I had so much fun dying. Can't wait to do it again.

RATING: 8
Wonderful although it feels a bit insane.  The basic mechanics are very solid, and both phases present regular interesting choices.  The feeling of insanity comes in with the way things always seem about to snowball into fiasco - even when they aren't or needn't. For instance, at the start, your character feels badly underpowered.  This apparent uselessness really redoubles if you have poor luck in card draws on levelling up, but it's all a bit misleading - the extra die is the main thing, with the possibly useful card effect just a bonus.  If that kind of thing - options hidden under apparent uselessness - irritates you, perhaps pass, but this game is also very easy to mod if you must.  On the whole, the terrain added by the expansion is a good thing, but the game can slow right down into fiddly land if you get the wrong mix, and sometimes it's fiddly with little game yield.

Συνεργατικό adventure game με ανάλαφρο και χιουμοριστικό fantasy theme. :) Οι παίκτες εξερευνούν διάφορες τοποθεσίες για να βρουν εξοπλισμό, χρήματα και να κάνουν level up αποκτώντας έτσι νέες ικανότητες. Σκοπός είναι να φτάσουν στην τοποθεσία που κρύβεται ο τελικός εχθρός και να τον αντιμετωπίσουν αφού όμως έχουν πρώτα επιβιώσει από τόσες κακουχίες και μάχες. :arrrh:

Ουσιαστικά έχουμε μια ομάδα με τυχαίους ήρωες που έχουν τυχαίες ιδιότητες, εξερευνούν τυχαίες τοποθεσίες, βρίσκουν τυχαία αντικείμενα, τους συμβαίνουν τυχαία γεγονότα και κακουχίες, πολεμούν τυχαίους εχθρούς και στην μάχη ρίχνουν ζάρια για να δουν αν μπορούν να χρησιμοποιήσουν τις ικανότητες τους. Βγαίνει άκρη μέσα σε όλο αυτό το χαοτικό τουρλουμπούκι?? :what: Και όμως βγαίνει. :p

Το παιχνίδι καταφέρνει να είναι κάθε φορά τελείως διαφορετικό. Πρέπει να είσαι προετοιμασμένος για όλα και να παίρνεις ρίσκα όταν σε παίρνει. Και είναι δύσκολο. Στις πρώτες παρτίδες απελπιστικά δύσκολο. θα πεθαίνετε εύκολα και συχνά.  :devil: Μετά όμως που μαθαίνεις τι κάνει ο κάθε αντίπαλος, αρχίζεις και καταστρώνεις πλάνα. Είναι από τα παιχνίδια που θέλει παρτίδες για να καταλάβεις ότι υπάρχει λογική κάτω από την επιφανειακή randomίλα.

Μου άρεσε πολύ και το combat system με τον κάθε εχθρό να έχει το δικό του A.I deck που γράφει απλά και κατανοητά τις κινήσεις που κάνει. Ο καθένας έχει διαφορετική λογική ενώ επειδή η λειτουργία του δεν είναι απλά μια κάρτα, δεν μπορείς να είσαι σίγουρος το τι θα επιλέξει να κάνει. Το όλο σύστημα μάχης είναι κάπως abstracted καθώς δεν έχουμε δωμάτια, τετραγωνάκια και line of sight. Στο παιχνίδι οι χαρακτήρες είτε είναι adjacent είτε είναι χώρια και ανάλογα μπορούν να χρησιμοποιήσουν τις ικανότητες τους ή όχι. Βρήκα το όλο σύστημα πολύ ενδιαφέρον και εύκολο στην εκμάθηση ενώ παράλληλα δίνει πολλές επιλογές στους παίκτες σε τακτικό επίπεδο. Εύγε! :meeple: 

Τα components είναι λειτουργικά (nothing fancy) αν και θα προτιμούσα οι κάρτες τοποθεσιών να ήταν μεγαλύτερες σε μέγεθος. Έχουν πολλές πληροφορίες πάνω τους σε μικρή γραμματοσειρά. :yuk: Το artwork είναι ικανοποιητικό και μέσα στο ανάλαφρο κλίμα του παιχνιδιού. Οι κανόνες είναι καλογραμμένοι αλλά να σημειώσω πως έχω την δεύτερη έκδοση που λογικά θα έχει διορθώσει τυχόν ορθογραφικά λάθη και παραλείψεις της πρώτης.

Μου άρεσε επίσης που το παιχνίδι έχει ξεχωριστά την adventure phase (που προχωράς στο χάρτη, κάνεις quests και αγοράζεις εξοπλισμό), και χώρια την combat phase που πέφτει το ξύλο της αρκούδας. :p Αυτές οι φάσεις εναλλάσσονται και έτσι δεν υπάρχει μονοτονία. Μπορείς έτσι να κάνεις και σχετικά εύκολα save την παρτίδα σου και να συνεχίσεις αργότερα.

Aν έχετε παρέα που πεισμώνει μετά από κάθε ήττα, τότε το παιχνίδι είναι ιδανικό για σας. Ανυπομονώ να δω τι προσθέτει το expansion.

Game sounded interesting but ended up being rather disappointing. Adventuring phase is a series of uninteresting non-decisions about how to quickly scrape together money to buy an item or a level for a character. Combat phase is almost played for you as your actions are dictated by your dice rolls where you might occasionally get a choice. Leveling up is too random and often get abilities that don't suit the character at all. Nothing about this game is particularly enjoyable. Traded away for something we'd actually enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The Adventure phase, where you level up your characters and gain resources prior to battle is pretty fun and interesting.

Once you get to combat, however, the monsters vary widely in their toughness. Zombies, one of three possible "level 1 monsters," are broken as far as I'm concerned, and the extreme amount of luck involved makes it hard to plan well.  Each combat related ability is activated by rolling the appropriate number on a die, and if you don't roll that number, you don't get the ability.  

There is also a lot of randomness throughout the game:  hero "traits" are assigned randomly, items, new abilities (gained through leveling) are random, events, peril checks, etc etc. 

Good play requires careful planning, as synergy between characters is essential for success. You need to play with a group that is willing to think carefully and discuss decisions.

It's a hard game, and I'm not sure that the learning curve required to play well (in order to mitigate streaks of bad luck) is really worth it.

Update:  I've decided it's not worth it and sold the game.

RATING: 9
Very long (took us 6 hours), but excellent. I do not understand those who claim that the game is luck-based: there are many meangful choices to make, and combat is highly tactical. Lucks play a role, but IMO tactics play a larger role. I love it.
However, it may be difficult to find players to play for 6 hours. The game is very involved and there is much to read on the cards. 
Also, the game is written in good english despite its polish origin. Very polished, beautiful cards.
A gem, in my opinion.

Wow,  this game feels incredibly tight. Very difficult, but wonderful.  You are trying to maximize as best you can but at the same time you have this delightful adventure going on.  The abstract battles are VERY tactical/ choice riddled. that said, the dice driven abilities have lead to quick downfalls, but such is the nature of dice driven push your luck  skills.  This game gets better and better the mroe you play as you learn what is good what si bad, what is worth it... or not...

Lots of fresh mechanics in this adventure game. I particularly liked the pre-battle phase and the different opportunities in the territory cards, and the tactics aspect of the game is introduced elegantly through the token engagement mechanic. Other than that, I would wish that the battles are shorter, less massive and more in number, like in other adventure games.

The game has many flaws, but remains one of my favorites.  Typos and misprints as well as the balance of some of the game mechanics.  The game is very difficult to beat as there are many random factors that have to line up just right in addition to smart play.

Because I can appreciate what the game is trying to accomplish, I took the liberty to modify the game to my liking rather than shelving it for a blue moon.  With my various variants, the game is still quite difficult, but much more of a brain burner and less like a kick to the groin.

The game runs longer than I usually have time for so it will be a game that gets played over time or rarely.  Only good thing about dying quickly is it shortens play time.

Pro's:

1) The biggest advantage this game has is the integration of the humour and the theme. It has to be one of the most bizarrely entertaining fantasy games out there.
2) By that token, the art is fantastic.
3) The adventure phase is  not perfect, but easily the best part of the game.

Con's:

1) Ultimately I sold this game due primarily to the combat mechanic, which I find painfully clunky and irritating. I think I would have preferred this game to concentrate on the adventuring part and really streamline the combat mechanics. This would also shorten the length of the game and make it much more enjoyable.

Side note: I on purposely am not rating this game due to the total 180 feeling between the adventuring and combat mechanics. I do not feel it is fair for me to do so as a result, especially given I only really played it once.

Initial Impressions:
-------------------------
A fiddly mess.  There were some really interesting aspects to this one, as I really like the exploration mechanism of the game.  The combat was a mess, and it gets even worse once you get to the boss fight.  The length killed this one for me, as it was WAY too long for what it was trying to do.  I also found the AI decks of the different bad guys to be repetitive, and very bland overall.  I would give it a shot again incase we missed some stuff, but this one probably isn't worth the effort.  Another underdeveloped kickstarter game...

Final Impressions:
------------------------
Played again and disliked it just as much as the first play.  I think what angers me the most is this one has some real potential, but it needed a good developer / publisher.  This one is too long for what it is, and way to fiddly (needs to be streamlined).  The game also is lacking in replayablity as a game of this type should offer many more than 3 encounter types per stage.  Glad I got to play it a few times, but very disappointed in this one.

In short: Genius

Perfectly streamlined, great system, insane fun; especially the fighting system.

Only thing: it feels as though the exploring part is "meant" for one player only. It can of course be played cooperatively, and I highly recommend to do this; but it gives steamrolling players the opportunity to just take over the decision making for everyone, essentially playing alone up until the fighting takes place.

Super fun game as long as you are playing with the right people. Otherwise, it can lead to rather unpleasant discussions.

RATING: 9
Provisional rating, might alter (but I suspect not :)

A game of two halves (well 6 really, if you survive long enough). First you adventure - but unlike others in this genre it isn't a snore-fest of endless walking, here you have 7 or so 'time' to spend rushing between areas exploring to get loot and silver (so you can level up) and venturing forth, to find new locations - and you need to do that, as you need to reach doomrock (the last area) before the final battle.

Once the time runs out you fight the first battle, if you survive, then it's another round of adventuring, then another battle, until you've done this 3 times (and not died in the process).

Lots of variety in the items, heroes and traits, and the traditional mold of class is broken wide open here - you can have an intelligent fighter who casts spells. 

It's tough though - you'll need to cooperate to win, and have a bit of luck, and work out the best combos and tactics to beat the monsters you face in each battle.

Game length might be a bit long for some - really it needs a quick start to jump the first encounter and start you on II if you have less time.

great game (for now. only 4 sessions played). the exploration phase is very funny and interesting. but there are few cards, for my taste. (the expansion give some cards, but... i think they are few, again. this game deserves a deck of 50 area cards).

the combat phase is agonal and funny too. i like the abstract of this phase. it's elegant, and somehow, when i directed roleplaying games, i used something similar.

upgraded to 9. after, 12 sessions.

RATING: 7.5
A silly, charming, and quite challenging co-op. I love the theme and the artwork, and really enjoy the exploration and group decision making of the adventuring phase.

Battles take a little too long, IMO (more than half of the play time), but I love how each boss is completely different, playing with the already very innovative and original combat mechanics in clever and interesting ways. I also like that individual attacks are resolved deterministically (apart from the exposure tokens), but the dice allocation phase still makes the battle tense and tactical. All in all, a fun, if slightly long, game.

While I think this one is well done for people that are into this sort of thing, I'm just not a fan of the more thematic stuff where a bunch of cards full of effects and special abilities build up.

However, one neat thing about the game is lack of turns.  The players are always just deciding things as a group, and deciding when the timing is best for each character to contribute to the task at hand, which is nice because there's really no down time for everyone that way.

So, overall, I think the design is quite good for a game of its genre, but I'm just not a fan of this genre/style of game.

RATING: 6
Not a full play so my rating/opinion is not firmly rooted. However, the abstract combat and general abilities and rules overhead felt a little complex for the space the game occupies as an abstract dungeon crawler. Think I'd rather play something a little simpler or go fully into a miniatures based crawl if I wanted a greater experience.

Update Nov 2015

Having played this a few more times, this is a fine game. I love the tactical combat puzzle, the variability of powers, and the efficiency mini-puzzle of adventuring. It would have gotten an even higher rating, if only the designer and developers/playtesters were a bit more careful with the typos, vague abilities formulations, rulebook precision etc. The game needs at a minimum a better rulebook with errata incorporated. Still, a distinct and enjoyable skirmish game.

---

Cooperative, abstracted skirmish game, with intermingled stages of character levelling up and gearing up. I played, together with the expansion a couple of full games, without winning (this is a tough game) and enjoyed it a lot. I am unsure, however, if this has a permanent position in the collection, mainly due to negative points below. 

+ wonderful fighting mechanism, centered around special abilities and dice placement
+ solid but abstracted tactical gameplay, with an interesting puzzle element
+ tongue-in-cheek humor
+ lots of variety (together with the expansion) in terms of bosses and minions, each with their special tricks, as well as items and special abilities

- repetitive gameplay, resulting in a weak adventure narrative arc
- lots of imprecisions in the card abilities, which get a bit tiring
- quite long for what it is, over 2h

Overall, a solid and innovative game that perhaps needed a bit better narrative dressing and some time-shaving streamlining. On the trade list for the moment.

Spontaneously bought at Essen 2014 after a small introduction from the designer. After playing this game several times, it becomes one of my favorites. 

this game is really cooperative and with the different abilities and strategies of the characters and the encounters, the game becomes very tactically. 

pro:
- fantasy rpg with big fights
- high strategy game play
- coop
- a lot of variations
- hard to beat

con:
- high portion of luck when playing with a random character selection (edit: and in general)
- small font size on the cards
- boss fights are a bit long

EDIT: Down-rated to 7 due to high potion of luck

This is a "Roguelike" boardgame if there ever was one. It's random, very replayable, there is a vast amount of different skills and items that interact in interesting ways and it's hard. Oh boy, is it hard. But it is not an unfair difficulty, there's just a definite learning curve to the game. Once you realize the importance of shields and the workings of the encounter cards, fighting becomes a challenging and very satisfying puzzle. Production, aside from a regrettable amount of typos, is very good.

We bought both ASSAULT ON DOOMROCK and FALLEN in the same month. After one play we instantly knew that FALLEN was overrated and ASSAULT ON DOOMROCK was underrated. This is a very fine game with lots of good puzzling decisions. As more content comes out, variety will enter the game, a la ELDRITCH HORROR. The game is somewhat fiddly -- the ruleset isn't 100% sound yet, and it's one of those games where you have to keep remembering a couple of extra modifiers granted by cards in play at all times. But outside of that, it's an excellent co-op that we are greatly enjoying. Cheers, designers.

RATING: 10
Aug 2014: I've watched some playthrough videos, and this game looks really neat.  I like the pacing of the pre-combat questing interleaved with a very interesting tactical battle system.  The systems of Doomrock appear to be much more interesting than Pathfinder Card Game, and I'm hopeful that this game will have longevity for me where Pathfinder did not.  This looks like a great solo game as well.  I think this game deserves more attention than it is getting!

The $60 price tag feels at least $20 too high, but what the heck.  If it's a as good as I hope, it will be worth it.

UPDATE Jan 2014:
This is a damn fine game with a very original take on the card-driven fantasy genre.  I love the combat tactical system, and it marries perfectly with the interesting but not overwrought adventuring phase.  Important decisions face you at every turn.  They could have called this game "A Million Ways to Die at Doomrock" but I really love the challenge the game presents.  Yes, there is luck, but every time I've lost I've felt that I made critical errors that led to my downfall.  You are not going to stride through to a win your first time through.  You'll need to learn how to fight each enemy, and need to adapt every game as you bring in a different set of skills and abilities.  It's a wonderful, flexible, challenging system, and I'm still enjoying it more with each play.

My initial hesitation at the price has evaporated.  We, as gamers, should be willing to pay for good design as much as nice bits.

This is a great solo game, and also good for a group that knows how to closely cooperate.  If you have alpha gamer problems, you should be steering away from co-ops anyway (and how empty does someone's life need to be that they feel the need to step on the fun of others to dominate a boardgame?)

UPDATE Jan 2015 (6 plays in)
This game is just getting more fun.  The encounters continue to be a great challenge, but I am also learning that the order in which you do things and the choices you make during questing phase are critical.  Do you risk venturing forth with low HP?  Do you focus or items or abilities?  Do you take a less useful ability just for the stat to enable use of an epic item?  Can you get a peek at the upcoming encounter and tune your adventuring around that?  

I've raised my rating to a 9, and I see 10 as a possibility.  This game is just a fantastic surprise.  Tom Vasel, marnaudo, I love your videos, but I think you are misleading people away from this great game! Doomrock is a real challenge, but it feels so good when you win.  The game has me totally geeking out, doing fist pumps whenever I am able to take an enemy down.  Give this game a shot, people!

UPDATE Sep 2015
This game has become the standard by which I judge all new dungeon crawlers, and it leaves most of them wanting.  Pathfinder, forget it.  Mistfall?  Too fiddly, somber, and dry in comparison.  King's Armory?  Well, I'm just not satisfied rolling dice to-hit at enemies any more.  Doomrock's use of dice and abilities is just so much more interesting.  Gloomhaven?  Before Doomrock I might have jumped on it, but now I hesitate. Upped to a 10!

This game had a lot of potential:

-Card-based dungeon crawl game
-Dice allocation instead of a dice combat system
-No fiddly line of site/grid based combat
-Excellent artwork
-Good variety
-Co-op

The game basically is 3 rounds with two phases per round: exploration/adventuring & combat.  I personally really enjoyed the way the adventuring/exploration phase took place. I could see some people not enjoying it because it essentially boils down to an action point system where all players must agree on how to spend these points. I typically only play co-ops with two, but I could see this being long and drawn out/frustrating with alpha players in a game with a higher player count. 

Where the game falls short is combat. The biggest problem with combat is how long combat takes. Three rounds of this game will probably take 3 hours and 45 minutes of each hour will generally be focused around combat.  That's far too long.  Even if this game was shorter with experience and was only 2 rounds instead of 3 (something the designer is looking to design as a short variant), it would still probably be too long of a game for me. The game has AI cards to control the villain, but I have yet to see this feature implemented well in any game but Sentinels of the Multiverse.

Maybe an expansion will fix this game, but I'm not waiting for it and will definitely not repurchase the base game + an expansion.  It's too bad, this game had so much potential.

The things I like about it: the characters (frustrated paladin is hilarious), the fight mechanism (simple and elegant), the fluff in the game is very tongue-in-cheek
The things I don't like: It drags on something awful. 
There are two significant parts to this game - exploring and fighting. Exploring is fun and easy, fighting is interesting for the first ten minutes and then it gets repetetive which kills the fun.

This is another of those underdeveloped games I see more and more of these days thanks to non-traditional funding like Kickstarter. There are some nice ideas here, but it feels wonky and in need of a strong developer to streamline some aspects to make it flow better and faster.

This is a dice activated battle game that has a brief, interstitial traveling phase between each battle. Of course the enemies get increasingly tougher so you need to bulk up appropriately between battles. And heal. There’s no free healing in the game. The traveling phase is mildly interesting in terms of managing your time resources to heal, upgrade skills, or get money/items. But it's the dice battle mechanism that's the main attraction here. I found it reasonably fun in how you can roll dice up to 3 times and then assign them to the abilities you have. The cooperation comes in the form of using each player's abilities to time attacks efficiently. Unfortunately, I found them game underdeveloped in each aspect.

The game first feels wonky in how it tries to be an adventure game and require you to acquire certain skill combinations before you can use certain much needed epic items but may not give you enough time to make that happen. I’m not talking in terms of that classic game crucible of time vs what you need to get done but as in inappropriately tuned. Who wants to play an adventure game where the game doesn’t allow you to adventure and beef up before fighting the bad guys? Getting stronger is part of the deal with one of these games but you can be hosed with some bad card pulls (e.g., right skills, wrong items or vice versa) and having to constantly reheal before battle. 

See, in a strange choice, you don’t automatically heal between adventures so part of your precious time has to be spent healing. But then you go get some stuff of one sort or another and pull Peril cards that ding your HP again. Back to the healer at some point because you simply can’t go into battle not fully healed. Having to constantly revisit the healer is simply not fun and the first thing I'd remove.

Another strange choice: at the end of each combat round you lose the heroism and shields you had earned. So there’s no taking a turn off to build up for the next one. Sure, it’s “tight” but so tight it removes a creative consideration for the players. Hey game, how 'bout you give me some space to play here? 

Perhaps a new version or expansion will address the game's weak points providing a smoother and more classic adventure game experience.

RATING: 6
Truely difficult, maybe impossibly hard co-op. I like dicing for abilities each round, but the end of section "boss" encounters are very fiddly and procedural, not to mention insanely hard as the monsters get tougher as their numbers dwindle (the "frenzy" rule).

Awesomely overproduced with tons of stuff, but if offered a choice I'd pick Runebound over this.

FYI - I don't enjoy most cooperative games.

A card-based adventure game with a great sense of humor. I liked the character, the special abilities, the art and the theme of the game. But unfortunately I had quite a few problems with the game.

The game is pretty finicky with lots of tokens and moving parts. I didn't like that you would constantly get damage even outside of battle. The battles themselves though quite interesting were very difficult to manage and play right.

Offers a unique take on epic fantasy, creating what amounts to a three-act campaign on your table in about two-and-a-half hours. Replete with decisions that truly matter and epic combat that is challenging and rewarding, this game will keep me coming back for years. This is my favorite solo game. It would be a 10 except for a large amount of easily-avoidable typos and one very noticable defect on the back of a card that appears (when I look at video reviews anyway) to be present on everyone's copy of the game.
EDIT 8/25/15: The designer replaced my defective card very promptly for living in another continent. The second edition of the game also promises to correct the typos and backers are receiving an upgrade kit to their first edition. Top notch designer and still an amazing game!

Seems to be a difficult game to win, has a steep learning curve (at least for me), but has some interesting terrain tile manipulation effects. Scanning through other BGG owners plays of this, I've seen players reach 19 games before actually winning one!! Man oh man!!! I can't rate this game very high due to my frustration of learning it, and missing a lot of important things that get overlooked. There's just so much going on that it is very easy to totally miss things, and I'd find myself retracting moves to try and fix my goofs. Maybe it will improve with more plays. Even though I've been frustrated with it, there's a lot to love about this game too. Even if I lose, I'm going to play it just to see what happens. Those terrain tiles are really weird.

It's definitely long, and complicated... I don't think I've played through a whole game without making a mistake or two.
But is is AWESOME solo, one of my favorites, and great in a group too. The adventure portion isn't too exciting, though it is a ton of fun to level your heroes.
Combat is so fun, tactically engaging, and tough as nails. I've never failed to make it to the final battle, though, so it always feels winnable.

House rules I use to reduce the luck factor and difficulty:

* Third encounter is chosen by the players.

* Heroes and traits are chosen by the players.

* When several characters are leveling up at the same time, draw three abilities per character leveling up and players give one ability to each character leveling up from this common pool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An extremely innovative but frustratingly flawed game. I return to it again and again for its ideas, but it's almost not worth the time to play without house rules, at least if you want to feel any sense of accomplishment as a player.

The game is not broken (mostly), but the balance is just way too tight, from limited time markers to crazy difficult battles where you can't even get any damage through the base armor. 

The most frustrating is the punishing and derivative dice-based ability activation. Sorry, didn't roll what you needed? Guess you won't be moving or attacking this round. A bad roll can totally undermine what would otherwise be a fascinating and fulfilling tactical experience. The uncertainty in what actions a player may have available each turn undermines the more interesting timing decisions players can make when their abilities are available.

The inter-combat questing is quite interesting mechanically and I love the explicit time modeling, but there is no narrative followthrough to the encounters—time just stops and players have a combat encounter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Hugely disappointing game. After 2 plays, I can say I'll probably won't be playing this again.

- very fiddly game, a lot of bookkeeping (constantly adding counters)
- 'adventuring phase' (or whatever it was called) is rather boring, very few if any relevant choices, no sense of player commitment
- combat takes way too long
- the 'hard to beat' reputation is due to the inceredible amount of randomness inherent in the design. Throwing dice to see which abilities you can use means that (even with rerolls) you can get stuk with 'useless' dice. Random combination of weaknesses with abilities results in 'impossible' combinations (penalties if engage in close combat, combined with skills only usable in close combat further reduces options)
- I completely failed to identify with your character (due to the random character building and loot), which is a prerequesite for a RPG experience.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after one play. The game has some dark humor to it, but it also hard as nails to win which is not necessarily a bad thing, but you truly have no space for error. Want to play again to see how it goes.

UPDATE
Played with four people and we made it, barely to the final encounter. After 6 hours play we had to concede the victory to the dark lord which crushed us after losing most of its minions. Definitely we were taken down by the second encounter where we had use all our consumables to survive. Not for the faint of heart! After this game I really have no hurry to play this again in the near future, but I may give it another swing since there are many good ideas here worthy of consideration.

There's a lot of interesting stuff here; this is an excellent iteration of the (welcome) recent trend of excising bloat and chaff from the tired adventure/dungeon crawl genre. The exploration bit is honed to a keen edge, and the combat is a fascinating affair of tactical minimalism.
This reminds me of Claustrophobia, in that they share similar design goals and successes. That's high praise (that said, Doomrock is easily twice+ the length of Claustrophobia).
I welcome the goofiness, as it serves to differentiate it from the hordes of also-rans in terms of theme; but others might be turned off.
The only sour note is how derivative and unforgiving the dice system is. Didn't get the numbers you need? Oh, sorry, no attacking for you.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Joc cooperatiu de cartes de temática fantástica. Similar al Pathfinder ACG, però sense la opció de mantenir els progressos del PJ entre partides. El joc dura 3 rondes, en cada una hi haurà un objectiu a complir en uns determinats torns, al final dels quals els jugadors s'hauran d'enfrontar a un enemic. La part d'exploració té molt bona pinta i sembla millor que el Pathfinder ACG, tot i que no acaba de ser del tot temàtica. El sistema de combat és novedós i funciona mitjançant assignació de daus.

Tot i que pot ser interesant, el fet de que sigui cooperatiu (per tant, només el jugaria en solitari) i que pugui acabant sent un puzzle em fa pensar que no m'acabaria d'agradar...

The game has uncommon ways of handling adventuring and combat. Very interesting combat system that requires a couple of plays before you know what you should be doing (and what you should be doing is different depending on the enemy). It's hard (which is good) but manageable. A bit on the long side, but still good.

[b]2nd Edition, 2 Player Review:[/b]

Every time I've taught this game, even though I'm just explaining mechanics and rules, everyone has always had their interest almost immediately peaked as I explain the location in which they find themselves and the choices that lay before them. Because of the nature of this game, even the usually dry rules explanation is dripping with theme and ignites the imagination, which is exactly why I adore this game. 

Much like "Robinson Crusoe", while the mechanics are sound and extremely enjoyable, it's the story that I find myself being swept away by every time. It's rare for me to enjoy losing a game as much as winning it, but in both of these games the designers have nailed the story-telling experience. And surprisingly, Assault on Doomrock has squeaked ahead because of it's much more strategic combat and puzzle-like adventuring, rather than the more random nature of "Robinson Crusoe". 

The reason I rate the game so highly, is because there isn't a single thing that I don`t like about the game or feel detracts from the overall experience. Yes, there isn't miniatures or a board, but that isn't where my attention would be focused anyway. The experience created is much deeper than that. 
I love the time-management puzzle of adventuring, the amount of randomness which adds to the excitement without feeling unfair, the responsive AI that is a joy to spar with, and every mechanism that flows into each other so smoothly; you are free to spend your time engaging in fun story-telling and imaginative role-playing rather than being nose first in the rule book.  

The randomness of item and skill draws in combination with certain enemy types can lead to some unfortunate match-ups; but I really feel this only adds to the thematic story-telling experience and the massive amount of replayability inherent in the game. No co-op game should ever have a 100% victory rate. 
I understand that randomness is usually a bad thing in longer games (it usually infuriates me as well), but it feels very reasonable and enjoyable here. If anything, it forces you to rethink strategies, use certain skill combinations in different and exciting ways, and compliment the skills of your teammates rather than thinking you can Leroy Jenkins it all by yourself. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- A truly immersive RPG experience
- Feels like an RPG, plays like a puzzle game
- The abstract Enemy AI is incredibly thematic (Zombies grab onto you, Large beasts ram you, Slimy tentacles throw you around and pull you into the monster's gaping mouth)
- The rhythm of the game, bouncing between adventuring and battles, is spectacular.
- The sense of escalation in every adventuring phase as each new battle approaches, is palpable. 
- The tension of every battle is amazing as it's either a close-shave victory or a near-won defeat. 
- They have distilled the essence of an RPG into each choice, making every single action fun and meaningful. 
- The comedy of the dialog and the locations is never overbearing and only adds to the fun banter between players.
- While it seems fiddly, every mechanism works together like a well-oiled machine with absolutely zero waste. The rules are so smooth I never have to check for exceptions or clarifications. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- The game is loooong, especially if you're trying to thematically ground your choices with in-character dialog. (My first full learning game with a final victory against a level 3 boss took 4 hours with 2 players)
- The abstract nature of the combat and the lack of models will turn traditional dungeon-crawling enthusiasts off. 
- The mechanics promote smart and careful strategy and team-work. Charging in sword swinging will surely get everyone killed. 

[b]*1st/2nd edition comparison*[/b] Unfortunately I never played the 1st edition, but whatever improvements were made to both the rule book and terminology must be fantastic. The Index especially was incredibly helpful during the learning games.

First impression: Intriguing, very *different* game. Whether the "different" part is a good thing or not remain to be seen, but so far my feeling is that the game may be a little too odd and abstract for my tastes. Not bad though, it is certainly refreshing to see a dungeon crawl implementation that doesn't just rely on the old movement-points-and-hit-dice method...

I'd probably rate this one higher, but this is a game that is extremely difficult to win and takes 3-5 hours to do it. I've played three times now and lost each time. Edit: I've now played 5 or 6 and got 2 wins in. The secret? Forget about items - gain levels! Well, items are good too, especially if they augment an ability well, but you need those extra dice.

The great part about this game is that it flows very well. You spend a few minutes cruising around at locations on cards and traveling onward. You won't be able to do everything, so you determine what will be the best chance of getting more powerful before your first battle starts. Then, you get to fight!

The fights are really neat. Roll your dice and allocate what you got. You get a Yahtzee-style round of three rolls to try to improve what you got, but you inevitably end up with useless dice. That part I don't appreciate as much, but it is way better than your typical Amerithrash where you roll for a number and fail.

The fights are crazy hard! They take the better part of an hour to play through. It is a great feeling of accomplishment to defeat any battle in this game, but you will have to defeat two more if you're successful the first time in order to win. Luckily, you get to travel and explore and maybe get flung from a gnomish catapult or have a picnic with cultists while adventuring between the fights.

All in all, I really enjoy the game, even when I lose. I'd rather win when I put effort into it, but this game has the journey down to an art that is funny and simple, yet complex enough to enjoy. 

Also, the stories it tells with the emergent properties of the mechanisms are masterful. Take the warrior who is Cowardly (grants "Cover Eyes" ability), and the mage who is Frustrated (grants "Slap" ability). Basically, the warrior cowers in a corner with Cover Eyes, forcing the mage to take an extra hit from a minion. Then, the extra-damaged frustrated mage comes over and Slaps the warrior to recover life (that felt *sooo* good) which pushes the warrior away. It is a free move, which might be a good thing for the warrior, depending on where the warrior ends up.

Quite difficult, seemingly occasionally to the point of frustration, but it is clear where player choices lead to the end consequences.  Abstract, yes, but this is a great strength of the game in limiting setup time and in-game fiddly-ness.  A sublime experience, with an appropriate amount of humor.  It consistently provides opportunities for cooperative tactical planning.  The next great adventure game has arrived.

This works well with 2 and would clearly work well with one.  It might be a bit long with a full complement of players.

A very original approach to an adventure game. It abstracts enough to allow you to no sweat the minor details (like where characters are exactly on the battle field - rather you're either adjacent to someone or you're not, or like just having 3 battles per game, but those battles are epic - the minor battles along the way are abstracted) while still capturing the sense of exploration and tactical depth to the battles.  One of my favorite games so far.  
One note is that this game is truly cooperative (during exploration phase the entire party must do the same things, and during battles hero cooperation is key), so can definite suffer from alpha player syndrome.

This is a unique hybrid "dungeon crawl".  Think Eurotrash.  Such a clever design with some really unique elements.

The theme drips through with great humor.  Pretty steep learning curve as you figure out how to succeed, but this is good.  It's very rewarding.

This game is my cup of tea.

Excellent adventure game. The abstract combat may not be for everyone, but we love it. Very strategic, interesting decisions, character progression and near infinite replay ability.
The only down side is the play time, but the game naturally falls into three 'stages', so can easily be broken into smaller sessions.

(260415) Initial feeling after trying the game out: it seems good. The manual is a bit on the long side, but pretty well laid out. It does take few read-throughs to get things going, and I also felt necessary to have a peep at a run-through. Rahdo's video on the game gives really good impressions on how things work.

The setup takes a moderate amount of space, and if you keep the game organized, it isn't that much of a hassle. I really would love a board for the game, and will probably at least print a something for that purpose. I'm somewhat disappointed by the fact that the cards are so small, but then again - it does cut down on the space needed. The art is outstanding and really evocative, the somewhat snarky and overblown names the creatures, abilities, places and items have fit the theme well. The tokens are double sided and made of good quality cardboard, whereas the cards are a bit on the flimsier side. 

Gameplay is very interesting. The aim of the game is basically to defeat three, increasingly difficult encounters. To do this, the players need to be able to gear up their lowly heroes by utilizing the resources available. The adventuring phase seems like a pretty interesting, randomized optimization puzzle that plays out differently depending on the heroes and locations given. At first I thought it felt weird, but the more I think about it, the more I like it. The evil master villain is unleashing a devious plan that the heroes must stop, and he isn't going to wait for them (hence the hurrying up to the Doomrock location, which sets good constraints on grinding some locations). 

Combat is perhaps a bit drawn out, but really good. At this moment in time, dice allocation is a favorite mechanic of mine, and Doomrock really uses it well. The AI cards are very clear on how things work, and I like that they are somewhat scalable depending on the amount of players. I played the game solo, so there seems to be a good amount of stuff to keep a track of - monsters gaining shields, shields resetting every turn (and NOT accumulating), fast or "initiate" abilities being used prior to monsters, exposure token flipping, the lot. I'd really like a player board as well for this game (much like Mage Knight), and it might be something I'll pull off eventually. All the little tokens easily make the playing are a bit of a mess. Combat is challenging and evocative, and the abstractions of space work really well. 

All in all, I think the game fits perfectly between Mage Knight and LotR:TCG. It isn't as expansive or time consuming as MK, but feels more like an adventure than LotR does. All take a similar theme and pull it off in their own way.

An interesting new (October 2014 Essen) addition to the dungeon crawl games. This is completely a card and token based game, i.e. No board.
The combats are extremely brutal and the party needs to coordinate their attacks carefully in order to take advantage of the monster's attributes.
There is very little time to heal up and gain skills/items between the combats which makes the game difficult to win. That in itself is not a bad thing as it encourages further plays of the game.
After one play my only real issue is the luck element of rolling the combat dice can result in your character playing no part in a combat round and just getting beaten up by the monsters. There are a few cards which allow dice manipulation but with so many cards in the item decks it is rare when these will come into play.
Maybe you could use a heroism/shield token to change a dice?

Played once.
I wanted this game to reveal its magic to me, but instead I was overwhelmed, and left feeling like someone brought the mechanisms of Elder Sign, LotR LCG, and D&D Castle Ravenloft together, but left out the special sauce that makes those compelling experiences.

So many moving parts in the form of separate card decks - character cards, traits, combat abilities, common and epic items, adventure locations, two types of encounter, three levels of bosses, an AI deck for each boss, major and minor terrain.  Add to this the tokens needed to track resources (time, heroism, health, etc), and to illustrate the field of combat (when you get there!), and the barrier to getting started with this game is immense - if not utterly deflating.
Getting beyond physical functionality, the adventure phase feels abstracted into the distance and then so driven by the cards as to be almost lifeless.  When finally you do enter combat, it is dice-driven and brutal, and yet there's so little sense of purpose to it other than moving the game forward.

RATING: 8.6
This game is so deliciously evil. Just when you think you've got a handle on how to beat it, it humbles you. Like severely.  Leveling early and trying to enter battle not limping it seems is key to getting deep into the game. My only gripe is the setup and tear down and at some point I will find a better storage solution.

This game has right away given me more of an adventure feeling than any other game I can think of. I have to say however that this game pretty much works mainly well as a solo game for me. The fact that during the first phase players have to agree on an action the whole party takes just doesn't work that well for me. So this to me is pretty much a solo game and rated as such.

The adventure phase is quiet interesting, but the battle part is what really impresses me. It just offers a lot of interesting choices and a great combination of tactical and push your luck element with opponents with an interesting AI.
I also love the humor in the game and while I'm already wondering if locations and encounters are not a little bit low in number concerning replayability on the end of mixing the heroes with the different traits, there is quiet a bit there.

The only negative thing I can say is that it shows here and there its self-published nature: The rulebook is overall ok, but could have used some better explanations of individual cards. I find the few coins a little fiddly and already wonder is I should put in some other money. Also fontsize on some of the cards is still fine for me, but especially with several people around the table, it could have been a little better. 

But maybe also this shows in the positives as the game feels very fresh and novel and I'm happy to overlook some of these minor points as the game overall just provides a great experience.

This game is in a weird place, it is fun but it isn't very satisfying.

There is a lot of neat concepts in the game, but they are poorly implemented making it very unbalanced. It is a very hard game but not a very challenging one. By that I mean that looking back on games we lost we didn't get what we could've done better except get better rolls, get better random loot and make choices on information we didn't have at the time.

The combat are not very strategic,you pretty much know what you have to do with each character in a given round, it is just a matter of getting the right rolls. The problem with the dice part, is that you don't have much alternate strategies, some values make some dice useless and others will give you access to skills you don't need.

In my case I'm in the process of house ruling a lot of stuff to mitigate the randomness, so it makes the game more strategic. To me the simple fact that adding some control over what you do and adding some information about what you're about to face makes the game easier is a sign that it is difficult for the wrong reasons. 

Still fun to play once in a while, but I wouldn't recommend it.

RATING: 6
This is a very mechanically clever game, but I believe the reason I wind up bored is that none of my choices are ever difficult. You start off in the adventure phase, where as a group, you have to choose how best to spend your time tokens. This is a sequence of non-decisions, as really all you need is to get X dollars to spend on Y characters leveling and then whatever gear happens to show up at shops. Then you do the battle phase where your only significant choice is who you stand next to. After that there is the cute puzzle of figuring out how everyone's abilities can best combo, but it's just not enough to be compelling, since the activation of those abilities is die roll reliant. Ultimately, I would keep this if I didn't have Legends of Andor, which would win for this game's table slot every single time without contest.

My initial play did not go well.  The second...also...did not go well.  So, I'm two plays in, and I'm wondering why I paid so much bread for this game.  Not an auspicious start.  
The mechanics for the adventure section are totally solo-play, but the meat of the game, that is, the battle sections, are long, long, long, almost tedious affairs linked intrinsically to dice rolls.  The abstract positioning stuff is interesting, but your characters never really feel...tough.  It is always a limping movement to do two damage on an enemy that has twelve hit points.  
I'll keep it around for now, but my first impressions have not been favorable.  
Also, the insert was trashed when I opened it, but the box was fine.  That, to me, says that whoever made it knew it was trashed, and simply didn't care...that's unfortunate.

Interesting way to switch up play between questing and fighting but just way way way too long for what it is.  Game took us nearly 4 hours for 2 players.

Lots of fun, and a nice way of using dice. Was a bit surprised about how long a game can take - at least a game where you go through all the way to the third fighting round. Quite a bit to keep track of for a solo player - but definitely doable. The vast majority of the time (at least for me as a solo player) is spent on the fight rounds, a lot less on exploring.

Impossibly difficult, but ridiculously fun. Such a silly and clever take on classic fantasy tropes. There are plenty of dice to roll, yet enough strategy to entice the more euro oriented gamers. Combat is a bit abstract, but a little imagination goes a long way towards picturing the intimidating battle scenes. The only complaints I have about Doomrock are the time it takes to complete only three battles, and how the game's difficulty is highly dependent on luck of the draw. I'm fairly certain the only defeat-able boss battle is the tentacle monster. The dragon is outright impossible. hopefully the expansion tweaks a few things.

The game does an excellent job at removing fiddly elements of a dungeon crawl and still maintaining tactical, strategic, and thematic richness and arcs.

Although there are elements of this game that I find interesting, like the adventuring aspect involving a progression through the area deck to represent a journey, the overall feeling I'm left with is one of being cheated and frustration by design. 


Fiddly rules and token management is a pain -

In the game's favor, the rules are short and become clear after a little trial and error experimentation, allowing you to get into the game fairly quickly, but they still feel fiddly because of the constant adding and subtracting of heroism, shield, and expose counters. Token management was a constant housekeeping activity that got tiresome very quickly; now, to be clear, I like the use of tokens to record status but Assault On Doomrock has taken a good thing too far. 


Underdeveloped design could have been so much better - 

Also, although I understand that the combats are designed to be very difficult, I felt more frustrated than amused because so much depended on my dice rolls and ability card draws. I kept looking for something that would give me a little more control over the dice - some way to manipulate the dice results - but there are very few ways of doing that, and the few ways that exist, themselves, are dependent on chance to obtain and use. This is especially disappointing to me because rolling dice to activate abilities was the thing about this game that appealed to me the most. I was looking for something like the mechanism in Roll for the Galaxy that uses dice to provide a variety of tactical choices rather than as a means to just randomly close down abilities leaving the player with a pile of useless dice. If a certain hoped for dice result doesn't occur, it should lead to other possibilities, maybe not the most desirable but still playable possibilities, not simply lead to a dead end. Rolling dice to activate abilities is the central game mechanism in Doomrock. A good design would not leave a player with no playable options, as is the case here.


My opinion - 

This game has some interesting mechanisms that could make for a really terrific game with some more design work. Even though I'm not rating AOD very highly, I still enjoyed experiencing the design elements, if not the game. As the game stands, I don't think I'll be playing it very often in the future, but I'll give it a few more plays with the expansion included to see if it makes a positive difference. I'll keep looking for a better RPG adventure game with more depth that presents more interesting choices when tragedy befalls the adventurer. (I have high hopes for Gloomhaven.)

Getting geared up is a blast. Battles are strategic and incredibly challenging. The amount of luck (card draw and dice) for the level of difficulty can sometimes be frustrating. This game can be punishingly hard! Due to its length, I'm less keen on this than in other shorter games such as crossfire. Art is quite nice. Playful sense of humor is reflected in the encounters, locations, abilities, and items. Wish there were more varied AI cards at two player count.

Theme.  Everytime I play the game, I'm overwhelmed at how much theme comes through from simple text on the cards and the mechanics the game uses.

For example, while wearing the armor "Impaling Pauldrons of doom", you can move a character with you when you move.  IE, you impale them, and drag them with you.

Every card, every action in the game is just dripping with humorous things like this.  It all fits so lovely and makes me laugh more than any other fighting game I've ever played.

The Euro mechanics are amazing too.  It takes dungeon crawling, puts it on cards to simplify the process of adventuring and speed it up, but still keeps all the theme.

If you don't really like adventure/dungeon games, then you probably still will not enjoy this game.  However, if you love hack and slash and love the simplification of Euro-games, then this may very well enhance your experience on game night.  Especially if theme is a requirement in order for you to enjoy a game, like it is for myself, most of the time.

It really only loses perfection based on length of time.  I'd rather have a slightly shorter game.  It takes around 2 hours to play.

Excellent fantasy party crawler. Unique in the sense that this is actually the first boardgame that really gives me a role-playing feeling. Yes, way more as Pathfinder.

Reason: roleplaying has 4 components: the individual role-playing, party decision making within the world you are in, individual combat and survival and leveling up/accumulating more gear.

Assault on Doomrock nails the last three components. Very impressed, considering this is the first game of Tom Stasiak.

Components are good but for the cards. A bit flimsy cardstock. However, as there is no shuffling done this is not a problem as it might be in deck-building games. 

The rule-book could be better. As it usually could be for new publishers and/or crowdsourced games.

Cards display tiny font as well. I have no problem with it as my eyes are good, but if you don't like small font reconsider. 

However, combat counters are made of thick professional cardstock, and as you are manipulating those a lot, this small publisher knows what is really important.

I'm willing to overlook these minor component issues based on the strengths: party adventuring is nice and feels really like role-playing (what do we want to do and what effect do we want to achieve). Leveling is nice, though it might be strange to have a fighter slinging fireballs (as there is no restriction on what abilities to get). But actually that is a fun deviation of the 'normal' I like.

Accumulating more gear is always good, limited slots to wear them is as we know it. Shared party inventory is what you normally have as well. Battle comes down to very interesting dice-driven action selection and a 'adjacent/distant' mechanic that plays well. 

Worry about the replayability of the combat encounters, as there are simply not that many. However, the abilities, heroes, map and global effects are many so there is enough replayability in the box as is.

Finally, the humor really makes the game to have a light hearted nature.

Played a friends copy yesterday, will definitely secure a copy tomorrow in Essen.

Excellent game, really, really recommended for role-players that can do without the role-playing!

AoD is two totally different games combined into one.  There are three "rounds", each of which has an adventuring phase and a combat phase.  The adventuring phase is all about spending your limited amount of time to look for treasure, explore locations, and level up.  It's very streamlined, but all of the decisions to be made are very interesting.  Each location feels unique and there are many levels of risk/reward.  I really love how the adventuring was implemented.

Then there is combat, which revolves around an abstract map that doesn't have any grids or line of sight.  There are just groups and you are either adjacent to an enemy/hero or you are distant from them.  I was worried that the abstraction would be a turn off, but really it just streamlines combat so you don't have to spend 5 minutes planning your most optimal move that gives you line of sight or cover or whatever.  Actions are spent by rolling dice and assigning them to abilities.  IMO, this is the best possible use of dice in combat.  It's kind of similar to [thing=36932][/thing] in that respect.  Enemies act from an AI deck that has some unpredictability in it.

Characters are pretty standard for fantasy games and they play very differently.  Then you get a quirk that makes them even more unique.  Leveling up gives you more powers and actions while loot gives you extra bonuses.  Really, it feels like an epic adventure campaign condensed into 2-3 hours.

This is a really great fantasy co-op adventure.  I'd put it ahead of [thing=127398][/thing], [thing=133038]Pathfinder Card Game[/thing], or [thing=65532][/thing].  I haven't played the co-op [thing=104162][/thing], but I expect I would prefer AoD.  The only problem now is that the game is very hard to find and I just missed out on the kickstarter for the 2nd edition and expansion.

It's really the combat mechanism that intrigues me.  But I can also say that the story element looks strong too.
I'd love to get my hands on this at a reasonable price, or even test play it.

after diving deeper I decided it is too random and too punishing to be enjoyable to me - if you don't get armor or weapons on your item draws, you are dead. If you don't roll attacks, you are dead. If you don't roll movements, you are incapacitaed and will die. And the enemies are far too punishing, especially in the two player setup (which is what I run in solo play). The system is great in its idea, but the implementation is deeply flawed and far too random for my liking - it would require a ton of house ruling for me to get it to be enjoyable. Due to BGG rating setup it is a "deeply annoying game, won't ever play again" for me, even though its ideas and art are great. Sad.

First impression is quite positive. Imaginative, thematic, original combat that requires varying strategies. The initial "leveling up" left me a little flat, as it seemed far too easy compared to the larger, epic battles, but it will take another few play throughs for me to cement that opinion.

All in all, a good exploration/fantasy game.

An impressive adventure game that offers rewarding choices with simple mechanisms in a package oozing theme and humour.

I was extremelly surprised by this game. It packs an amazing theme, extreme and wonderful variability, a great sense of exploration and adventure, agony and push your luck elements, spot-on humour, and yet at the same time it is riddled with simple yet absolutely crucial decisions to make. I loved immediately both the campaign part and the battles, and the number of things this game hits the mark in my opinion is absolutely remarkable. It's also difficult but beatable, creating an amazing sense of accomplishment as you struggle to complete the battles and push forward. The game sucked me in its world completely in my first plays. Doomrock doesn't waste your time as you play it, you are constantly enganged so the result is that you feel you've done something epic.

There is luck, but you test your chances so often that it evens out and what makes the difference is your choices in the end. So no, I can't really see that as a negative. It does take long to finish an adventure and that is definately something to keep in mind if you're short in time. The funny thing is that you will often fail very early in the game. Which makes the total play time very wild. If you manage to make it all the way through you may play for 4 hours total. But you will most probably just die within the first 1-1.5 hour. So if you have, say, three hours, you may be able to play twice easily, or you may not even be able to finish one game. That's a very wild swing. Finally, I usually dislike the fantasy setting, but not so much in this game as the light humorous theme manages to completely save it. 

This game was an absolute blast. It has set a new mark in adventure games for me. Mage knight is the only thing I can compare with it, and even though it is an entirelly different beast (minimum luck approach) I enjoyed my first assault on doomrock adventures more!

I played this game a couple of times and so far I really enjoy it. The game is brutal and it may take a couple of tries before you even get to see the third (and final) encounter.

What I particularly enjoy is the puzzling with the different locations. You need to get to the final location but you can get there quickly or slowly and paces in between!

If you don't like rolling dice, stay away from this game as it is one of the most important factors of the game. It can be incredibly swingy but I personally do not mind that. Great brutal(ly difficult) game!

I love that the game is really pared down to the essentials, using location cards and tokens instead of the usual huge board, plus the artwork throughout is fabulous so a definite 10 for the aesthetics. 

Gameplay is also a 10; I LOVE the adventuring, the combat slightly less as it can drag on a bit but that's probably because I'm a bit pants at it. 

After further plays:

Loses one point for the rulebook as it doesn't cover the rules in enough depth, even the 2nd version. Although appearing clear and straightforward it took a browse through the Rules Forum to discover I was playing several aspects incorrectly including Push (ambiguous as to whether you still suffer damage after being pushed) and Hidden (???!).

At first I deducted another couple of points because the combat is impossibly hard and I constantly lost but then I read a forum post and saw it in a new light: it doesn't matter so much if I do always lose, at least I'm enjoying the journey up to that point and I guess it is at least 'realistic'. Plus if ever I should win then WOW will I feel a sense of accomplishment! 

Whilst looking forward to the expansion I hope it isn't going to complicate this game further as I would prefer added variety rather than complexity. Specifically please add loads more adventure cards as this part of the game is brilliant!

By far one of the best & unique battle mechanics in an adventuring game that I have played. Tried Legends of Andor afterwards but it just didn't give me the same feeling of progression where you level up to build your character. The decisions during battles are the best part to maximize your skills. Just wish the location cards are a bit bigger otherwise a solid RPG adventuring game to me. Tons of fun with Solo or Co-op.

Gra ciekawa, bardzo klimatyczna. Szczególnie podeszły mi klasy, podział na klasy, różne umiejętności odpowiadające tym z prawdziwych komputerowych erpegów. 

Chętnie zmieniłbym kilka zasad (otrzymywanie przedmiotów, czas, walka) co sprawiłoby, że gra byłaby naprawdę przyjemna.

D&D&D. Co-op fantasy adventure. Fun humor, good art and production quality. Modular random setup board. Random inherited personality traits for our characters. Simple-ized combat system (in a good way).  Face three major encounters that increase in difficulty along the way.

This is a tough one. I really like it, although the balance between adventuring and combat is somewhat off. 
I like the combat system but it doesn't give you many possibilities to make truly tactical play. What you can do is decided by the dice that you roll, after that it's just min/maxing. On itself that would be fine. IF combat would be done in 15 to 20 minutes. Unfortunately it takes 3 times that. 

Also the base set contains to few variety. Which the upcoming expansion will probably fix. However as, for me, it plays best with 2, I think I have games I enjoy more for the time investment.

Conclusion: Purge!

Fantasy adventure?  Check.
Variable powers and leveling up?  Check.
Liberal use of humor and clever wit?  Check.
Simple setup, easy rules, and plenty of hard choices?  Check.
Brutally difficult and challenging? Check.

I LOVE this game.  (Except when I am in a hurry or crunched for time.  I'm averaging around 5 hours for a 2 Hero game! :surprise:)

Pretty much every aspect of this game needs to be house ruled or tweaked to provide the kind of adventuring fun most are looking for from something like this. And even then, you can't do much about the lack of interesting loot, the sheer randomness in every aspect, the repetitiveness of the abilities and AI cards, and the somewhat narrow-mindedness and repetitiveness of the tactics you'll need to employ to actually win a fight (of which there are three, at 1 hour each). The "adventuring" portion is also a bust, mostly bad choices and all about getting a bit of silver/loot or healing up; no real excitement and minimal flavour, and no fights. There's so much more you could do with all those decks of cards.

I did like how the whole team has to cooperate to find the exact ability combos you'll need (if you have them) to beat the monster algorithm so you have a small chance at winning, but that was the only real little bit of fun, in an overly long, often tedious, fiddly package. And even with this, you really need everyone equally engaged and determined, and carefully looking over all their abilities.

Definitely more challenging than Rise of the Runelords. I also feel the theme very strongly in this one. Overall, a great effort by Paizo.

RATING: 5
What a terrible rulebook...  Three hours in and I still don't have a clue how to play the game.  The "reference" on the back, if you can call it that, doesn't help.
The Blessing deck - do you get the effects of the Blessing you drew?  It doesn't say in the Playing a Scenario walkthrough on page 8.
Actually, each paragraph in the rulebook I've read so far has at most half of the critical information it should.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I have a lot of opinions of the game. Starting with that I feel this is one of the wost rulebooks I've ever read. Poor wording, terrible organization, no examples, and constantly makes assumptions. My first 2 games were severely hindered by this rulebook. By game 5 I was feeling like I got it right, its a very very simple game but the rulebook does a poor job explaining it. 

On to the game; Its great for what it is. It's not at all strategic, its very much like a co-op Munchkin with a slight more rules. I want to enjoy this game as a roleplaying game in a box, escape into my character and you know, ROLEplay but I find it impossible when the game feels so mechanical and has some very odd choices that I have to pin on inside jokes without an point of reference to go by. 

The game is really only meant to be played in a long campaign, but I just finished the first full adventure path and I struggle to think of a reason to continue. Yes you're teased with new powers, feats, and bonuses but I don't think the game offers enough tactical or strategic options or meaningful choices to really warrant playing through pack after pack. 

I think if you go in and play a few games you fully see what this game is, a fine card game with some luck and sometimes a choice or two. If you play it on that level it can be fun, really fun actually.  My last game came down to the last blessing card and the final die role, that was very exciting and I had a blast. But nothing really propels me to continue, and the lack of immersion keeps me from getting invested. 


Update:
Traded away. Just didn't see myself every continuing, nor felt the drive to.

RATING: 3
Besides punishing just because it can, this adventure path is  too complicated/fiddly for what it is. You will need both hands for the amount of dice, and either a good memory or a sheet of paper to keep track of all the plusses you get from all the various sources - your skills, your powers, your weapon with discard, your allies/items/spells, your mythic ability,  don't forget what another player adds, and what the armies add as well... Then roll the handfuls of dice and add them all up to 30-50+. Much more to keep track of than other adventure paths!  I have no interest in playing this one again. This is an RPG activity...why make it so fiddly it becomes drudgery? I know how to add....I just don't need to bother with this amount in any game. Any other adventure path is better as of Mummies Mask.

Includes a few new mechanics like Redemption/Corruption and Mythical Paths, and has a flair for the demonic, since that is what you are entering the Worldwound to battle against. Feels a little more epic than the previous Path, but does lack some of the amazingly cool characters for that one. That said, more adventure packs could improve this.

One of the big highlights of PACG has been acquiring good cards, and choosing between "looting" the scenario at the cost of winning. This new set throws challenges so severe at players that this choice is gone - you are surviving, and acquiring boons is something you can't invest in to do so. Not that you'd want to, either - the beneficial cards are so lackluster and uninspiring that you'll take a pass. This set is largely for hardcore players who want to slog through a lot of hard challenges. For everyone else, it might feel more like a chore than a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
More of the same Pathfinder ACG.   Solid. It does not completely engage me, but it does have me wanting to keep progressing to build up my character.  Game felt a bit more interesting than Rise of the Runelords, but with some added complexity.

Ultimately the game is let down (as is Runelords) from the lack of any real story emerging.

Same PACG gameplay, but the difficulty has been increased and the character powers have been muted.  That might sound drab, but I think it is what the game needed.  Runelords was way too easy.  Shackles was easy and unbalanced.  So far Wrath feels about right.

RATING: 8
Fills my itch for some good roleplaying without the 4 hours of prep time (as the DM) and the four hours of playtime.  Plus, you can scale it for solo campaigns or for just you and two friends.

I am definitely going to try to play this game as much as I can whenever I can with a core group of two more players. 

RPG-lite with someone else writing the adventure!  Awesome!

Draw a card, see what happens; roll, see what happens? Rinse and repeat? Just awful, with no relevant decisions whatsoever. Miles away from a RPG feeling, or from a board game. This a "Diablo board game": randomly generate magic items, hoard and collect them to satisfy your sense of greed. That's all there is to it.

Compared to Rise of the Runelords, this is noticeably more difficult, with most of the random difficulty coming from certain specific banes, mostly barriers.

Besides some annoying barriers that are very difficult and make every character fight them, I am so thoroughly enjoying playing through this - solo, 2 player, 6 player, whatever.  Dice and luck are a big part of it, but after playing tons of the iOS version (Rise of the Runelords), you get a good sense of the many strategies and tactics you can use, plus character party combos, etc.

So far, this pathfinder adventure card game set is my second favorite, despite having a harder time beating this one. The set has some cool characters and introduces cohorts (which I love), as well as other interesting new mechanics. The theme is dripping from every corner of the game like an eldritch ooze.I don't know for certain yet, but I think this is the hardest of all the sets. If you're playing through them all, perhaps save this for last, or if you feel like the others didn't present enough of a challenge.

RATING: 2
Rating based on 8-9 plays of the first few scenarios.  I really wanted to like this game, but [b]IT SUCKS,[/b] and I would be pretty mad if I had paid money for it.  There is no way I would buy or play any other game in this series.

First, the rulebook is lousy, and fails to answer the many questions which come up during play.  "Cards Do What They Say" assures one paragraph; uhh, if that were [i]true,[/i] we wouldn't be thumbing through the rulebook trying to figure out what the hell these cards [i]mean.[/i]  In some places, I have no idea what was intended, and we just make up rules interpretations on the fly to keep things moving; in other places, the clear [i]intent[/i] of the rules is clearly contradicted by a literal reading of the rules.  And, there are presumably important terms on some cards which don't seem to be mentioned at all in the rules.

Second, the game is bogo-thematic.  One player pointed out that the whole point of a cooperative dungeon crawl is that you have characters with different strengths & weaknesses, so that each character can deal with the problems they're best at, and characters can team up on things; this game blows both of those concepts.  The Paladin and the Ranger are in the same location, and they have an encounter which needs the Paladin's charisma?  Too bad; the Ranger is the one who drew the encounter, so the Paladin can't assist in any way.  And what the heck are these cards supposed to represent?  Well, I have two suits of scale mail, but I'm not wearing either of them... Oh, I took some damage, so now I have [i]both[/i] suits available!  Apparently when you're selecting gear, you're not [i]selecting gear;[/i] you're tweaking the probabilities of the gear you'll have at the start of a given encounter, and that quantum waveform collapses in the morning when you're lacing up your boots & discover that actually you're wearing your snowshoes today, and instead of fighting an orc you're buying a crossbow.

Third, the game isn't really [i]fun.[/i]  "Choices Matter" says the rulebook; no... no, they don't.  In tonight's game, I ran into the villain early, used all the resources I could possibly use... and flubbed the die roll, taking enough damage to cripple me.  None of my choices in that encounter mattered, and very few of my choices [i]before[/i] that encounter mattered, because I didn't draw the cards I needed.  (I died an encounter or two later; total play time for me was less than the scenario setup time.)  And this game wasn't exactly an outlier; a couple times, we've run one scenario, and gotten hosed because of the way the cards came out, and then run it again, and beaten it easily because different cards were in the location decks, and/or they came out at different times.  "Gosh, I hope I draw the right card!" (followed by "I hope I don't roll all ones") is the whole damn game, and that's just not interesting or fun.

[b]Update:[/b] the night I was going to throw this in the trash, I heard NuGames was having a white elephant gift exchange the next day, so that's where this went.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
FIRST IMPRESSION:

I expect we'll end up going through the entire campaign and that's fine - I enjoy the group with whom I play even if the game system is not as interesting to me at this point. This rendition feels a lot more fiddly right out of the gate which is a pain. On the flip side, the prelude campaign feels a lot tougher than the other sets at this  - point! WAY MORE FIDDLY - one has to draw random cards way too many times or hunt for a specific henchman or two from the past for other stuff.

RATING: 8
Gameplay:
+ very simple and easy to learn mechanics
+ very cooperative game; you must play together, if you wish to win
+ one scenario can be played quite fast
+ one adventure path consists of 30 scenarios!
+ continuous character development throughout the entire adventure path
+ quite challenging (more challenging than the previous sets)
+ new, very intriguing mechanics are smoothly integrated into the system:
1) Mythic Path: Allows you to roll a D20
2) Cohorts: More personal allies basically
3) Corrupted Cards: Giving you benefits with certain disadvantages to consider

Components:
+ good quality cards
+ nice artwork on the cards
+ nice box with a perfect insert to sort the base set as well as all future adventure decks

- sleeved cards don't fit well and the insert won't hold all adventure decks, when sleeved which makes the insert useless for me
- only one set of dice, although you need about five

Conclusion:
Out of the three sets released thus far, I find this one the best. It improves upon the first set without adding unnecessary or useless mechanics like the second set did.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I love the extra challenging scenarios - very exciting! Luckily still nobody has died but we close sometimes and have lost several scenarios already. So far I enjoy this set the most!

Update. Towards the end this got too easy for me. And you had to do too much maths for you checks.

Main adventure paths in progress:
(1) Crowe (+ Adowyn, Enora, Kyra) - finished (with some early losses)
(2) Seoni (+ Shardra, Balazar, Imrijka) - finished (with some early losses)

Another great PACG from Lone Shark and Paizo. One of my favorite solo games, with unparalleled character diversity and progression. This continues to diversify mission types and the addition of mythic paths and cohorts add a nice wrinkle to the tried and true formula.

This one is a small step back from S&S though, with some frustrating obstacles and confusing scenarios that bog down gameplay a bit.

Tried some 5 player solo and that was hard.  I'm running the characters solo through the first mission to get a feel for how they work.  

Alain went easy; 1 try.  

Imrijka went hard; 4 tries.  

Enoura was 1 time.  Only reason was that the main villain had an arcane check.

Balazaar was 1 time.  Just like Enora--arcane check is the way that I got out of that one.

I didn't enjoy Skull and Shackles, but I thought a more traditional fantasy theme with this system would suit me better, and I was right. Plus moving your ship around became very cumbersome. I'm still not completely in love with this game system, but I can see how others would be. Rolling dice to acquire cards can be fun, but it's still frustrating with how much luck exists here. I may pick up the Egyptian themed one at some point, just because I think I'll enjoy that theme most, but this certainly improved my opinion of this game's system. Just not to the point that I want to revisit this version.

Would rather play Shadowrun Crossfire.

I get that Paizo was going for a harder game but the encounters are more cheap than anything.  CONSTANTLY summoning, fighting, and taking unavoidable damage from tree demons is not fun.  

I can only recommend it for hardcore fans who are masochists.

Take Rise of the Runelords, make your characters much weaker in the beginning and much stronger at the end, and make the whole thing more difficult by adding more triggers and more rolls and you get this. If you liked RotR and like dying, this game is up your alley.

Much the same comment as for the original game. Have a character with your own deck of cards. On a turn, go to a location. Flip the top card of that location. Do its skill check by rolling the die your character tells you, and add more dice or bonuses using cards from your hands. Then either use card abilities to do more stuff or end your turn. Continue having turns around the table until someone finds a baddie at a location and defeats it, then roll a skill check to close the location down, reminiscent of Arkham Horror. When you find the big boss, he'll escape to a non-closed location, so basically you want to close stuff down until he's got nowhere to go, and then if you defeat him, you win the scenario. Next scenario, get new locations (each location has different special effects), build a new deck for each location, and go again. After each scenario, you wean your deck back to its starting configuration, but if you've found some better spells say at a location, you can choose to keep these and discard your starter spells, still getting you back to your max 3 spells or whatever. Which nicely ups your character as you work your way through scenarios which no doubt will get tougher as you go. That's quite cool. But the turns aren't much more than flip a card, roll a die. There's not as much co-op stuff to do as you'd hope, but you get to donate cards to players in need and play cards to help each other out. As a solo game, it's not much chop - basically just flipping cards through the location and die rolling which ain't that exciting. Better as a multi-player where at least you can enjoy the social co-op experience, with a bit of the cheer/groan ride that the game can provide.

I'm impressed how a pen and paper RPG can be pretty well represented by a card game.  The only thing I really miss is tactical movement in combat.  You explore a number of Locations that are represented by a small deck of unknown cards that you flip over one at a time... maybe you encounter a monster, a trap or treasure???  Then you use your character's skills/traits/equipment/etc to overcome the obstacle.

On the negative side, we found many rules to be confusing and non-intuitive and that's backed up by the numerous rules questions and lengthy FAQ.

Purchased 10/10/16 for $15 from Barnes and Noble.

Single adventure is rather boring. Campaign is much better. Rebuilding your deck between games, and leveling your heroes, is probably the best part of the game.

Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous is a cooperative campaign-style game in which player choose and develop not only their characters over multiple scenarios, but also a deck of that character's equipment. Each scenario involves moving your character to various locations, drawing cards from a seeded deck associated with that location, either attempting to get more equipment cards, fighting a monster, or attempting to fight the scenario's villain. If the villain is defeated, he can escape to another location, but locations can be closed if that location's minion has been defeated, preventing the villain's escape to there. If characters lose against monsters, they take damage in the form of cards; once their deck runs out of cards the character dies. While I haven't explored this game very much, I wasn't very impressed by the gameplay--it often seemed like I was alternating between trying to get equipment I didn't need and getting smacked down by monsters. Everything depends on dice rolls, so everything is really just driven by randomness.

Seems good, a bit tougher, a bit more fiddly here and there. Some of the same typos and infinite loops that were erratta'd in previous versions keep showing up (cards that summon themselves indefinitely, mostly).

WotR is touted as the toughest set yet, and it seems to be mostly down two barriers: the Arboreal Blight (all characters fight a 2-auto damaging Treant and there's up to a % chance of another combat); and the Demon Horde, which caused an additional 16 combats in one game alone. These are brutal and, TBH, not much fun. Overall, though, it's more of the same that I already like very much.

While on the road I saw this in a game store and picked it up. Starting to review the rules, very similar to Rise Of The Runelords, with some additional rules. 

Played three games so far, and this one seems more refined and difficult. The demon meme throughout is what blends the scenarios together.

The more I play, the more I want to play. This is good.

Kolejny świetny produkt spod znaku Pathfindera. Nowa kampania, nowi bohaterowie, nowe mechaniki. Wprowadzenie mitycznych ścieżek wydaje się być dość mocne, do tego spory plus za dodanie cohort, które dla wielu bohaterów całkowicie ustawiają styl gry i są jakby ich nieodłączną częścią. Nie da się dobrze ocenić potencjału bohatera bez spojrzenia na jego cohortę, jeśli takową posiada. Wydaje się trochę cięższa, ale w sumie bohaterowie również dostają trochę dopałek.

Unnecessarily complex for the amount of strategy it offers. On your turn you basically turn over a card and roll a specific die or dice to see if you gain a card or defeat an enemy. However, each card has specific rules that you have to follow when using that card. These rules don't add decisions or strategy to your turn, they just add hoops to jump through. For me, this game overstayed its welcome.

I want to trade this with my Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous Base Set and the first four expansions. I do not have the last two expansions in this block - Deck 5 Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth and Deck 6 City of Locusts. Everything is in Good to Excellent condition. Minor card wear. Box has some minor dings to outside. I will pay for ship for my box if you pay for yours.

I want an even trade for Rise of the Runelords Pathfinder ACG with its expansions. I will negotiate the two missing expansions I don't have. Maybe I pay additional for the last two if you have them.ns.

More family-friendly adventure goodness, this time with a healthy dose of masochism and unfairness.

Overall, the scenarios, monsters, and barriers are just plain tougher to beat.  The base set includes multiple cards that attack everyone simultaneously, for example.  These wreak havok with support characters, who don't always have a weapon handy, and spellcasters, whose attack spells are one-use throwaways.  Additionally, some cards are flat-out biased against certain classes.  Example:

[o]The Carrion Golem (immune to attack spells) outright kills any spellcaster with seven or fewer cards remaining in his/her deck, unless the mage gets lucky and has immediate access to armor, evasion, or massive strength boosting from blessings.  That looks suspiciously like bad design.  Moreover, it's particularly unfair that two copies of the golem are included in the base set, making it more likely that the golem will appear in the first place - sometimes twice in the same scenario!

The card is particularly awful in our case, since we didn't peek ahead at the monsters and decided to include two spellcasters (one arcane, one divine) in the party.  Our solution: Permanently remove one copy of Carrion Golem from the game.[/o]

So, the game can be difficult to win and characters can definitely die.  For experienced players like us - who have played through all previous sets and expansions - that's fine.  We're still having quality fun, despite the difficulty boost and neverending [url=http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4]FAQ[/url].  (Note: Vinst [url=http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1h4#v5748eaic9u1r]has been errataed[/url], which makes the Elven Entanglement scenario actually winnable.)  However, in no way can I recommend this set for brand new players.  Start with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133038/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-rise-runelords-base]Runelords[/url] or [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/187687/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-mummys-mask-base-se]Mummy's Mask[/url] instead.

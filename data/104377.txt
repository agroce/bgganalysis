A light filler card game that you bet your 10 card hand each turn. I love the fantasy theme and it's illustration here with references to Star Wars, Zelda, Conan, LotR, Grendizer, Harry Potter etc. It plays really quick and it's fun! Best played with 4.

Kellemes meglepetés!!! A Jaipurt nagyon szeretem, és ez a játék ugyanannak a sorozatnak a tagja, ezért annak ellenére sem volt negatív előítéletem, hogy úgy harangozták be: "próbáld ki, de tuti nem fog tetszeni neked, gyerekjáték". Szerintem ez felnőtteknek is szuper szórakozás, nagyon jó ötlet, hogy 4-nél kevesebb játékosnál fiktív játékosok révén inaktív pakli is van (3 főnél 1, 2 főnél 2), a 4 pakli forog a 4 kör során, és így mindenki minden kártyát egyszer használhat. A 3 féle kártyakijátszási mód, a megszerezhető változatos +- kártyák, a ? és a x2 kártyák rengeteg taktikai lehetőséget rejtenek. Kifejezetten jó, és méltánytalanul hanyagolt játék.

Components: Cute character and monster cards. The multiplier cards (for treasure and monsters) should have some indication on it of its effect.

Experience: Blind bidding at its blindest. Very rarely did the revealed cards influence my decision; very rarely (i.e. never) did I recall the specific composition of a hand I had already played with. I just try to pick a few battles to fight for, and lose them regardless.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
This is a small filler that goes beyond what meets the eye.

Players should use their hand cards to a simultaneous bid for rewards (through higest cards value down on the table) or penalties (less value) but, in some cases, the logical is reverse - you must be the lowest ou you must be neither one or another (stay in the middle).
The great feature of the game is that the same sets of hand cards are passed in turn by all the players, so that, in the end, all of them can have the same chances, a bit like tournament bridge.

The hand passing is interesting and good, but playing the hands in different situations means it comes down to luck anyway.  Nothing exciting about this game.

Tschak is one of this game I don't really know what to think about. Yes the mechanics is interesting, yes the editing is really good, but I find it pretty boring.

I don't know really why. Perhaps, it is too brain-hassling, perhaps i played it too seriously, but i didn't find it fun.

However, I cannot say it's a bad game. You better should try it...

Fillers are hit and miss, and this one was a big miss for me due to the blind-bidding element which is among my least favorite game mechanisms. I just don't find it fun to play cards blindly and then try to remember who has which hand of cards and the distribution in their decks. Many other fillers I'd rather play than this one.

Card-counting players have a clear advantage here. Apart of that it's a great design. When everybody plays the same relaxed way the game is fun and entertaining. But if someone wants to optimize...

This is in essence a very light blind bidding game, but it does very well what it intends to do. It has a nice and straightforward Fanstasy theme - invade dungeon to get treasures guarded by monsters - and the cartoony artwork with funny references fits well. Highest bidder gets the treasure, lowest bidder gets the monster (negative points). The game has some clever bits, like passing the cards around between rounds, so that everyone plays once with each hand. That balances luck, but it may still be decisive, since different treasures and monsters are randomly drawn each round. But it is quick enough that this randomness doesn't bother me. Good fun, much better than other (usually awful) light card games that share the dungeon crawl theme.

A great game for 4 players- i havent tried it with 2. The game has left lasting memories in all the players minds- one in particular is one that one of the players ended up having to take Cthulhu (some tentacle-like monster included in the game) and still ended up winning! We now refer to him as the "All Mighty Cthulhu Slayer". ...great light game that I recommend to everyone!

Not as bad as people on here seem to think.  It's a lot of blind bidding, but you do have knowledge of what people want and eventually of what they have to bid with.

Fun trick-taking filler game in which at the end of each round players pass their previous hands on to the player on their left. There are 4 rounds and 4 hands, so every player will play each hand once.

The restrictions on gameplay (the cards come in 4 suits; when you make up a 3 card trick each card much come from a different suit) and the scoring add interest.

Ah, another game with an exclamation point in the title. (I think it's supposed to be the sound of a sword slicing through something)

Unusual trick-taking game, unusual in that you don't take the cards people play, but rather, a card on the board, usually a good card if you're high and a bad card if you're low.

It reminded me of Turn the Tide a little, with the whole "hands passed 'round the table" thing. Although I think I like Turn The Tide better, I felt more in control of things.

Nice art on this one. I was reading that it's all parody art, like there's a Luke Skywalker, a Frodo, etc. I didn't notice them, but, nice fantasy art nonetheless. +1 for that.

I really liked this, finally played it after it sat on my  shelf for almost 3 years. A little bit of out guessing your opponents is involved, and everybody uses everybody else's cards at some point, so it is a "fair" shot for everyone. It all depends on when you decide to use your points.

Played single player test game. Seems ok. Now to get an opponent.

Played with the game is all about making decisions about which cards to play when to best advantage. At first you are just rubbish at this. Then its about playing your own cards but also thinking what the others will do and also becasue of the variable powers of some of the things, somethings may be no good to one player but excellent to another. Its good fun. Takes a little bit longer than you might expect but it is still not slow.

Many comments made by he players about the artwork: Jedi/Harry Potter/ red faced bloke. Favorite was the 'cute' chameleon lizard .. according to 1 player!

you als oget to play all the hands against different targets which is a good way of even-ing up the game. nice little game.

As a huge fan of both Condottiere and Iliad, it wasn't an option of not buying this. Building armies from hand, comparing strength, grabbing reward, repeat- yep, gimme.
The difference is, that the hand management and consequentially the strategy is more constrained. Also, although it's seemingly balanced as in the four rounds everyone plays with all four hands, but there's a good chance that someone gets screwed when he has the weakest hand with the most punishing monsters in play, so complaints of randomness are almost guaranteed. But, then again it's a quick and light filler, who cares? 
The game got the GameWorks treatment ([i]meaning: exceptionally cool and top notch components[/i]), plays equally well with two to four players, and with kids over 6.

One of those "everyone play with the same hand and see what you can do with it" games in the mold of Land Unter. Which isn't one of my favourite mechanics as it doesn't engender surprise, tension or dramatic build - you're just playing the same game 4 times. In each round, you'll get to play out 3 cards 3 times (from your hand of 10), each time the high score gets a reward card, low score gets some unreward. There's some wibbles in that the first time you play 1 card at a time, second is 1 then 2, then the third time is all 3 at once. But that doesn't add much. In fact, I'm not sure the game adds much to the gaming world, but at least it was journeyman acceptable.

This game rubbed me the wrong way. I love blind auction games, but only if I know exactly what my opponents are able to bid. This is possible in this game, but I don't have the patience to remember all the cards in all my opponents' hands.

Or perhaps I didn't enjoy myself because the opponents I was playing with were very prone to AP?

Without question my favourite filler for 4 players. It has a lot more going on than you'd probably think after first few games and it requires a bit different set of skills to be successful: a bit of planning, a bit of bluffing, a bit of outguessing and an ability to properly assess possible gains. You really need to know what you want and what you're able to acquire; if you go for too much, you'll probably end up with nothing.

Plus, it's fun and cheerful. Love it.

This is really a fun game with some pretty stellar artwork.  It plays okay with two, but is much better with 3-4.  I really like that no cards are thrown out, you use every card in every game.  You also play every card you get.  And hands are only dealt out one time, and over the course of four rounds you will play a hand, then pass it to the left for the next round.  In this way, you will play every hand one time.  It's pretty cool that if someone else has the "perfect" hand, you will get that hand in another round of the game.  Great lunch game for 3-4 in particular.

31-08-2014. Rated after 1 play. Tschak! is a fun game in which you try to play sets of cards (wizard/warrior/dwarf etc), in order to rank either first/last or in the middle depending on the cards you can win by being first or last. It's fun, but light. Game plays over 4 rounds, and after your round you give your hand to your opponent. This ensures that during the game everyone tries to make the best of the same hand. It's fun, but light.

Kinda, sorta trick taking game in dungeoncrawl drag. The art is really nice and gets you in proper whimsical mood. Game revolves around getting the most out of your hand (the hands rotate) and trying to be the highest or the middle in each trick (depending on what the awards are). 

The hand rotating thing is similar in "high tide", but there is more tension, here it's more about the mood and the theme. It works, it's neat, probably great for (male) kids.

[Gameworks 11 edition] {Wizard; double guessing; optimal 4p} An impulse buy for its theme and for Gameworks.

There are nothing new in the mechanics but it is very interactive and can be quite nasty due to the scoring rules.  The hand passing is fun, as every one will know the hand.  In all, a fun double-guess game.

Gameworks calling this a trick taking game but it is misleading.  This game has no relevance with trick taking at all. It is more like a blind bidding game.

The production quality is very good. (actually, it may be over-produced, as the boards aren't absolutely necessary).  The card illustration is very cute and functional.  The only weak component is the gold pieces - it'd be better if they are made of wood.

It falls into that same mental area of trick-takers that only certain people can love.

Semi-fun, but far too luck based as to whether you get a good hand when the good cards to win are available.

Very much enjoyed this as a lite end of the night type game or a social game too.

Okay filler but because only the best and worst hands get anything, a lot of the time you're just playing to be mediocre and that's not terribly inspiring.

A lot of strategy for such a simple card game. Nicely made theme turning a card game into a dungeon crawl! Fun.

RATING: 5.5
Rating after a single play with two players. It might get better with more players, but as it stands the game sorely lacks excitement. It is as if Dominique never really finished the game. Passing your cards on to your neighbour each turn is a nice mechanic, but the treasures that you fight for also change each turn, which means that when you finally receive the strong cards, the treasures for that round can be pretty lame. Another thing that does not add to the excitement is the fact that you have to play all of the ten cards that you receive each turn. Sofar, I feel that Condottiere (by the same author) is a much, much better game. The artwork of Tschak is unbelievably nice however.

Light hand management game, a mix between Dragon's Gold (but shorter) and Turn The Tide.

Great fun card game that's sort of trick taking. The theme does work, if a little strangely

I see other comments that make this out to be a trick-taking game, and I have to say, I disagree.  I see where the comparisons are coming from, but you're not taking the cards played to the trick, and the players are doing a simultaneous reveal thing, anyway, which doesn't feel like a trick-taking game to me.  It certianly has a lot in common with Land Unter!, just much more simplified: You're going for either a good card or a bad card, and you're passing your hand of cards around the table for all players to play.  The comparisons break down there, though, since the cards you're playing make up a band of adventurers, and their totals play into which card you get.  Some special cards come out that allow you to base your strategy around them, but not all cards will be in play every game, so you can't play the game based on one of those strategies.  It plays decently enough as a 2-player game, though I think it will really hit its potential with more players.

The hands are small, and the cards to play for are drawn randomly, which means there's a good bit of luck in the game, but it plays quickly, and has enough thinking going on to make it a nice start- or end-of-night game.  Plus, the artwork and production quality is outstanding, which is becoming par for the course for a Game Works game.

Funny and smart concept, but a bit too random - especially if you don't like to count cards. I had high hopes for this one, but sometimes a small flaw ruins it all.

Rating by my child. Quite perfect game for certain ages (requires math and memorizing for good play). Not enough meaty for some adults.

Fun easy card game. Try and plan what card to play for treasure but some one always beats you. Well sometime they do, don't get monsters they give you negative points. Good trick playing game.

Revealed bid card game. Players have identical hands. High bid gets the treasure and low bid gets the monster. Two special cards to add a bid twist to strategy.

cool little chaotic trick taker with an unusual play structure... bluffing and second guessing to take or not take certain tricks, some things are points, some things take points away and cool artwork on the cards that is actually used as a tie breaking ladder...weird cool

GameWorks make the best boxes and inserts for their games - including keeping with the theme the whole way through! There's never much wasted space (if anything in this box, the insert should've been 2 mm lower), and everything fits neatly into its place. The same is very much true of TSCHAK!

TSCHAK! is very enjoyable. I think it makes a great starter or closer, especially for 3 or 4 players. The game is wildly attractive, and the theme's fun. The fact that you play the same four hands over the game's four rounds works very well in practice, and is something I haven't encountered in any other game.

I like how there are cursed treasures in the game that sometimes means you'll find yourself in a situation where you want to be the player in the middle of the hand's scoring, i.e. not the winner, nor the loser.

Since each hand is played differently and the rewards and penalties for each round's three hands are clearly visible beforehand, you can strategize a bit over how to play your cards best. It is even possible, and perhaps advisable, to quickly select the three hands you will play at the start of each round, just so you don't overlook a cursed treasure, or how you really cannot afford to be stuck with another troglodyte, or absolutely want to ensure that you get that one remaining magic ring.

As far as simultaneous selection games go, this one is neat in theme and time investment, but the mechanisms (especially some tiebreaker ideas) could use a little polish. Still, this is a cool game.

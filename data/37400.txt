Although many say this' a follow-up of Pickomino and it ranks lower(currently 757 vs Pickomino at 649), I found it more interesting and probably because it carries a theme and complexity more appealing to adults than kids.

Upped it to a 9 from an 8 because it plays so smoothly and quickly.

A good evolution of Pickomino. It plays more quickly, and offers some neat decisions on whether to score positive or negative points. I highly recommend this to dice game fans and Pickomino enthusiasts, and as a good gateway game for non-gamers.

RATING: 7
Looks like Pickomino, feels like Pickomino, yet quite a different game.  There's much more direct competition.  The timer is less prevalent, but it seems to play perhaps quicker.  There's a slight memory element, but it hasn't really come up yet.  This is more gamer-y, but not overly so.  A good game.

I look forward to more games of this.

RATING: 5
The scoring system redeems Sushizock from utter mediocrity.  The way in which only as many positive tiles score as you have negative ones is neat.  As for the rest, it's another Yahtzee variant, with tactics so bleeding obvious that winning or losing will depend solely on your ability to roll the  dice necessary to implement them.

Fast and reasonably fun Yahtzee-like wherein you have three rolls to perfect your dice such that you either take a positive tile, a negative tile, or steel tiles.  As in most Knizia games, the scoring is clever and makes the game that much more interesting.  Having said that, however, there is not enough game here to warrant a lot of plays for experienced gamers.

[i]Posted: 7/27/09, Rated: 6[/i]

Finally a sequel for [i][gameid=15818][/i] that was three years in the making.  Fewer dice are back, the number of domino-like tiles has increased, and there is a veneer of deeper strategy in [i]Sushizock im Gockelwok[/i].

Side note: I love saying this name.  It's a jumbled mouthful of chunky syllables.  It makes me wish I had the German version of its predecessor, [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15818]Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck[/url][/i].

With only five dice and two types of tiles, [i]Sushizock im Gockelwok[/i] appears to have less randomness, and more depth.  And at first, that impression seems to be confirmed: for every positively-scoring tile you have, you must have a matching negatively-scoring one in order to count it.  For example, if you only have a +6 tile, your current score is 0.  If you take a -2 tile, your score is now 4.  Note, this "even distribution" scheme does not apply in reverse: if you take a -4 tile on your next turn, your score is back to 0, although you are now able to take a second positive tile in the future to score it, too.

In reality, though, some of the fun is lost.  Stealing tiles is easier which makes this a more interactive game than its predecessor, but you're only allowed three rolls of the dice during your turn.  You can't push your luck as far as you can in [i][gameid=15818][/i], and that saps some of the excitement.

[i]Sushizock im Gockelwok[/i] is a fun game, and it is easy to teach.  It's not as wild as its predecessor, nor does it accommodate as many players (only 5 as compared to 7).  The end result is a game that doesn't score as highly.

RATING: 7
An enjoyable filler dice game.  The rules are quite simple, and a few of the decisions are rudimentary, but it is still quite fun.  There are options to steal from and be nasty to opponents, but the game is so light that most people just don't care.  The scoring is ingenious and there is a bit more strategy than you might initially suspect.  I like the seemingly counter-intuitive idea of keeping dice you don't need in order to try for a specific number of sushi/bones on the dice.  The whole idea of taking negatives to score any positives is what makes the game awesome and unique.

The downside I have found with this game is simply the luck of the dice.  Now this may sound stupid, obviously with nothing but die-rolling there's going to be a lot of luck.  However, there are times in this game where there is only one logical option for you (i.e. I have to steal his sushi in order to avoid getting even more negatives.)  So you are forced to try for that, and if you fail to roll the chopsticks necessary, you get another bone for even more negative points.  It almost feels like a runaway leader issue because one player can have all the good points and if the others can't manage to roll enough chopsticks that player can walk away with the victory.  Still I do enjoy the game and can deal with the luck factor because it really is an essential element in the game.

Good press-your-luck dice game.  Plays quickly, and the opportunity to steal tiles from your opponents adds a lot to the tactics.

Very good components.  The wooden dice and heavy tiles feel good.  There's a little over-printing of the ink on the tiles, and I wish the dice edges were not so rounded.  On a hard surface, the dice can spin on a corner for a long time.

Very clever filler with lots of dice rolling and a push your luck element, but, it appears, quite a lot of skill too. Definitely so with lower numbers of players.

Sushizock im Gockelwok is the same as Pickomino: yet, while the latter is a fine (however boring) game, the former is just an obnoxious rip-off, taking the worst out of Pickomino and developing it in its own way.

A decent dice-rolling, push-your-luck game.  It's a bit more interesting that Pickomino.  There are positive and negative tiles, and you must strike a balance between them to do well.  Also, it is easier to steal tiles, and there can be a fair amount of risk to re-rolling... plus the game should play a little faster than Pickomino because you only get 2 re-rolls.  ** UPDATE -- on subsequent plays, this game has become less interesting because so much is dependent on lucky rolls for stealing good tiles **

Obviously a close relative of Pickonimo but different enough to justify having both I think, so long as you like this type of game - short, fun closer/filler with very quick turns and enough luck to let you pull off the occassional coup and groan rather than pull your hair out when it's done to you.  I suspect it will see regular outings in the same way as its close relative has done for the past few years.  DiceCon East 2008

RATING: 5
Another kinda fun dice filler, but pushing your luck hurts you a lot less than other games, thus the lower rating.  You'll usually end up with something not too bad even if you do push your luck for something slightly better.  It's not like Pickomino where you lose something when you bust, as for most of the game it's not even really possible to bust in Sushizock.

Good filler! Another Yahtzee-like dice game where you get your three rolls to make the best of it. This one adds dominoes that you collect to score points in two piles: maximize a pile of pos. value dominoes, and minimize a 2nd pile of neg. value dominoes. A nice little twist is that you can steal dominoes from other players. This Knizia guy knows a thing or two about working tense choices in even lighter games.

Roll the dice and collect the tiles - either sushi (positive points) or fish bones (negative points).  Whether you take from the table or from your opponents is up to the dice.  Your scored tiles are stacked in your 2 scoring piles - one for sushi & one for bones.  Your bones stack must be as tall as your sushi stack to score all sushi points, otherwise your sushi stack gets hacked... down to the same height as the bones stack!  
Fun with 2.  Better with 3.  Even better with 4!

Roll 5 dice in attempts to maximize sushi (positive) points and minimize bone (negative) points.  May roll up to 3 times, but must "freeze" at least one die each time in order to re-roll.  The dice mechanics remind me of Knizia's Decathlon.  Quick, fun filler that I enjoyed, but it didn't go over well with my kids (ages 4 and 7) the first time through.  Will have to see if that improves with more plays.

Better the second time around!

The basic premise of this game isn't altogether silly. it more or less resembles the stereotype dice games which have been released during this time: throw a set of dice at most three times, keep one die at least, and do something with the entire result. In this game's case, collect either appetising [i]maki[/i], or [i]maki[/i] filled with grates (yuck). The edible sushi gets you points, and the inedible sushi point deduction. Edible and inedible [i]maki[/i] are collected into separate stacks, and if at the end of the game you've collected more edibles than inedibles, the former are reduced until the amounts are even [i]before[/i] the score is tallied! The reverse is not possible, so people want to collect some bad sushi (with small negative values, of course) too!

All in all the game is fairly simple and straightforward, and even somewhat interesting. Unfortunately I found it highly annoying to play as the dice appeared to be imbalanced. You have the option to steal either kind of sushi from other players (which is an action which can help you, and hurt them, i.e., a Good Thing™), but the chances of succeeding in this are very slim indeed. And that is not very nice as you can get stuck with a huge stack of inedible [i]maki[/i] for no reason whatsoever. The game is short enough that it doesn't really matter, but I feel that a game like Roll Through The Ages solved this better in that it always gives the player something useful to work with. It might not have been what he wanted, but it might prove useful nonetheless. Not so in this game, and that's a shame. It is simple enough to explain it to family or children; it introduces a mild memory game too (to rob others of valuable [i]maki[/i] which have been covered by others since); but if the dice don't cooperate you simply lose. I might play anew in a family setting (say with my mother for whom this game would be perfect), but amongst serious gamers this will be passed over for more challenging fare.

Great game of luck-management.

The power of the chopsticks is balanced by their lower probability and uselessness when only 2 turn up.

The elegant way that fish and bones are selected mean it's not just about keeping your options open and pushing your luck but also of ensuring you don't get too many of a symbol, 'landing' on an undesirable.

The game should be a lot faster once everyone's familiar with the game and even in the 'downtime' between your turns, the forced memorisation encourages everyone to pay attention and the one-roll difference between a great and average or lousy piece keep excitement high.

28-05-09 7.5->8.3
------------------
Game went very quickly with Ian, Sean, Stefano and myself. 

I think that the open information coupled with the simplicity leads to greater excitement when re-rolling dice - everyone can see if you're trying for a set of chopsticks or a particular tile.

Though the scoring can seem slightly complicated (stefano still not fully understanding them when it came time to score) the varying strengths of bones and sushi adds some strategy to the game.

You want as many bones as you have sushi - excess sushi being 'wasted' - but going over depletes your score. Almost a blackjack-like push-your-luck element.

The same element also comes into play when considering rerolls.

In any given roll, it seems you can go for chopsticks or a particular tile. With only 4 possible directions to reach in, working out how to reroll becomes a simple matter. The simplicity definitely seemed its biggest strength for me.

There were a few possible tactics I noticed - such as sushi being more potent if lower down (since it's then guaranteed to be paired if you don't lose it to an opponent). I considered trying to place them lower in future games but feel that optimally, any sushi above the median bone value is worth picking up, hoping to match the numbers of bones/sushi as much as possible rather than worry about positioning sushi so it's not wasted.

Players get three rolls to try and claim fish portions off the sushi-bar.  Clever die rolling game, where players roll five dice up to three times, and then implement the results.  They can either take a positive fish portion tile, a negative bone portion tile, or pinch a tile from another player.  Scoring is fish portions minus bones, but you must have a bone tile for every fish tile, making bones neccessary. Ingenious mechanics, with a memory element, make this a keeper.  Great bits too.  Related to Pickonimo, but this is a little better, I suspect.

This is an interesting little dice game.  On your turn you roll your dice and can re-roll up to three times, however, you must keep at least one die from each rerolled set.  You'll be collecting negative and positive tiles throughout the game and try to maximize you positive points and minimize your negatives.  In this process you can try to steal tiles from your opponents.  This is a really portable game and is good for a few laughs as a filler between something meatier.

First impression:  Lots of fun!!!!

Update:  We really enjoy this game and find it to be quick, fun, and just a great time.

I am very glad I was able to buy this as we play several games back-to-back without getting bored.

FUN!!

UPDATE:  Played a 4-player game in April 2010 and what a different feel!! Very vicious with lots of stealing!! Still very good and FUN!!!!!

Taught Mamadallama and her husband.  Very enjoyable.

Collect both bad and good sushi in equal numbers or your good sushi won't count. Hopefully your good sushi score more than your bad sushi take away.

Dice rolling mechanic where you may re-roll up to three times dictates what you can do with your turn.

Some interesting decisions but overall not particularly fulfilling as a game.

2008 acquisition.

Typical Knizia affair.  You need to balance getting the high score positive tiles and trying to get the low negative ones.  Like Pickomino, you can steal the other players tiles if you roll 3 or more chopsticks.

Overall not a bad game but it does not seem to have the same pizzazz of Pickomino.  More people may change the dynamics and increase the amount of screwage of the game and makes it more interesting.

I normally stick to whole numbers on may ratings but this one has me a bit stumped. I’ve selected this as my best new to me for a couple reasons. If you notice further down, I have Bus as one of my ‘new to me’ too. That one I’ve rated an 8.0. Shouldn’t that one be my best new to me? Well I rate games based on how I feel about them. But, then comes up that age old question, ‘why do your play stats not match better to your ratings. Well, I’m a social gamer too, so as long as I don’t hate a game, I’ll play it with people. So, if there is a game several people want to play, I’ll defer to them. So this game gets it because My ‘non-gaming wife’ will play this game with me. Plus, my kids will play it. We were at a sushi restaurant this month waiting for the sushi. (That’s the problem with sushi, is the wait sometimes is a killer) when she got up and went out side. Next think I knew she was walking back in with it. So, even though I may have some games I like better, I can tell this game will probably see some play. The Second reason to pick this game is it was a gift (his personal copy) from a fairly cool guy I first met Face to Face this month. Cheers Andy.

Finally, a plausible and well-rendered (not to mention timely) theme on a Eurogame.
I don't see why people are claiming that this isn't as good or deep as Pickomino; to my mind, this is clearly better, what with the requirement to balance two kinds of resources via four kinds of die faces; as opposed to Pickomino, where you must acquire as much as possible with one two kinds of die faces (i.e., numbers or worms, of which worms are strictly the best).

Oct08: That is a darn good dice game.  It features a very constrained time limit.  It also has some fun interaction between the players, with trash talk and tile stealing.

Your actual dice rolling involves real decisions.  The scoring method makes sure that you don't have obvious choices when it comes to taking tiles.

Also, the dice freezing takes some real thought since an extra symbol can really mess with you.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (June 2011)

To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about the game. I remember it is a light dice filler game with lots of uncontrollable luck. I also remember I liked Pickomino a bit more (but I dislike both games).

My initial rating was 5.5 and that was on 2011. I almost never rated a game below 6.0 in that year. Now I’m much more harsher with my ratings so I think that when I play again, Sushizock im Gockelwok´s rating will go down. If I play again I will come back and re comment.

Good components though.

Éste es un filler del tipo "exprime tu suerte".

Cada ronda puedes lanzar los cinco dados hasta 3 veces. Tienes que obtener la cantidad adecuada de sushi, raspas de pescado ó palos de madera (rojo ó azul). Con Sushi puedes conseguir una ficha azul de sushi (puntos positivos), con raspas de pescado puedes conseguir una ficha roja de raspas de pescado (puntos negativos) y con los palillos puedes robar una ficha a otro jugadore (azul o rojo, dependiendo del color de los palillos).

Las fichas se apilan en dos montones diferentes, uno de los puntos positivos y el otro para los negativos. Al final del juego, la pila de fichas positiva no puede ser mayor que la negativa.

Juego normalito, ni está muy mal ni está muy bien, pero me esperaba algo más divertido de él. Un juego para jugar mientras picas y bebes algo.

This filler game is a "push your luck" game.

Each round you can roll your five dice up to 3 times. You need to get the right quantity of sushi, fish bones or wooden sticks (red or blue). With Sushi you can get a sushi blue tile (positive points), with fish bones you can get a fish bones red tile (negative points) and with sticks you can steal a tile to another player (blue or red, depending on the color of the sticks).

You collect your tiles in two different stacks, one for positive points and the other for the negative ones. At the end of the game, your positive tile stack can not be higher that the negative one.

Average game, not too bad, not too good but I was expecting more fun from it. A beer and pretzels game.[/color]

First plays it felt like there was too much luck in this one.
Your actions are determined by your first roll. If your first roll is bad you haven't got a chance of trying to accomplish what you aimed to do prior to that roll. Unlike in pickomino where you most of the time still had options.

I like the rule applied at the game end: all sushi tiles that protrude over the height of the fishbone pile are removed. Those extras do not count for scoring whereas the fishbone tiles always do. This rule makes the game deeper and better than Pickomino.

Arrived July 7, 2009

Goofy, light, tile grabbing game based on rolling dice up to three times while "locking" in dice.

Simple to play, simple to teach, 15-20 minutes of "fun". More of an activity to pass the time than a strategic brain burner but packaged well for a light travel game in an informal setting.

After two 2-plyr games (both of which I lost) I can see this game has some tricky points to it. I recall that Pickomino is a bit more noisy and entertaining, but maybe I'll change my mind about Sushi-zok after I play games with more players in them.

RATING: N/A
Like most modern Knizias, a variant on a theme; an exploration of a previously-used mechanism. In this case, it's Heckmeck (or Pickomino, if you must). This time, there's less of a push-your-luck element, and an increase in the take-that factor. In Heckmeck, the only way to affect another player is to roll exactly what he has on his top tile and steal it. In Sushizock, this happens more often because it's all about the symbols you roll rather than your score. From that point of view, it feels less like Yahtzee. I like it a lot, and it's sufficiently different, but I'm not sure it has the legs to outdo its predecessor.

Carry it with me in a bag most of the time. Can play it everywhere. Waiting for a train. In a train. When sitting down for a drink in the city. when going to a not-so-fancy restaurant.

RATING: 5
A quick game of pushing your luck and trying to collect the most valuable sushi.  The trick is that you need to collect an equal amount of spoiled fish (bones) tiles in order for your sushi to count.  Those count for negative points.  There's a yahtzee feel but you can only keep one die from each of your first two rolls.  There's also a steal mechanic (rolling chopsticks) which I have mixed feelings about.  It provides more options and the allusion of strategy (shield your good tiles).  The problem is that you cannot really protect your tiles easily especially since they can be stolen right after you collect them.  This seems to kill what would have been a perfectly fine filler.

RATING: 7
A different game to pickomino in that it plays quicker and there is less frustration.  Meaning that instead of sometimes losing tiles due to a failed roll, you are more likely to get the domino you want without going to the 2nd or third roll of the dice.

There is also the opportunity for more interactivity with the players as it is easier to steal dominoes.

A quick (20min), easy, fun, competitive filler. The endgame gets tense when players' attempts to steal the best tiles from other players can backfire and result in them taking the worst tiles still on the table. The bakelite tiles and wooden dice are really nice -- no cardboard in sight.

This one has a bit of a sentimental value to me since I brought if with me during many trips.

It also involves direct interaction, which makes the whole thing a good combination in so many different situations. 

Great one!

A fun and simple dice fest game along the lines of Pickomino...but enough different to also enjoy playing! Roll the dice and you may collect a bad sushi tile or a good sushi tile. This sounds obvious except that you must keep 2 stacks of tiles (one good and one bad stack) because no positive points count unless your stacks are at least even! So, ideally you would like -1's and +6 tiles in your stacks! Nice game with an interesting scoring mechanic! It does have one horrible flaw however, indecipherable colors for people with even partial color blindness!

Played at least 10 more games during the past 10 days. Great game night opener or a filler but last only 3 sessions at once the most! It gets bored immediately on the 4th game.

Shorten Pickomino, combine the blue/red equality rule of Drahtseilakt. Both good things, but the points swing can be huge when just one tile gets stolen, and incommensurate to the quality of decision making made through the game to that point. Which is why I'll be steering clear in future.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was hoping this variant of Pickomino maybe an improvement, especially as there is a memory element in knowing where highly prized tiles could be hidden amongst the player's stacks, thereby increasing the non-player's attention not generally required in dice games . However in practice there are far too many number variables to follow, not only to steal effectively, but also to monitor who is ahead, even though the stack heights is no real indicator. 

One interesting design aspect is the sliding of the tiles, much like an elongated drafting mechanism of Showmanager: sometimes you have to consider the consequences of making it easier for the next players to roll for valued tiles when you take a tile.

Another reason why I was attracted to SiG is the easier resolution of the die rolls compared to Pickomino (which involved unwieldy multiples), as well as more schadenfreude of ending up with bones.

Since the arrival of Express Risk and Easy Come, Easy Go, Sushizok has lost its flavour.

This is the mechanical sequel to [thing=15818][/thing], and it's SUBSTANTIALLY more enjoyable. You roll dice with a push your luck aspect that lets you take tiles from the center or from other players, just like in [thing=15818][/thing], but the difference is that you are trying to build two even piles. One pile of positive point tiles and an equal pile of negative point tiles. Any positives you have in excess of the negatives are discarded at the end. This means you are angling for the highest positives possible, and the lowest negatives possible in sets, while trying to protect your good tiles from other player snatching them by burying them in your piles, because the steal mostly only works from the top of your pile. The group enjoyed this a lot as a quick filler.

The components are nice - especially the tiles. Definitely a light filler. 

Nice push you luck mechanic as you can roll 3 times select the dice to keep (must select at least one). Some other good mechanics. Selecting tiles from the common pool by position based on the number of matching dice. Being able to steal tiles from another player (either off the top or by memory down in the pile. The scoring of needing a matching red (negative) tile to score a blue (positive) tile adds a nice balancing element to your position

Fun game that ir realy fast. There is a strategy factor and a luck factor that you you have to manage. The interaction between players is realy fun has you try to steel high scoring tiles or low negative tiles to weeken there stack total value while trying to optimize yours to win. Great filler.

Bon jeu qui se joue rapidement. C'est un mélange de stratégie et de chance que vous devez gérer. L'interaction entre les joueurs est très plaisante alors que vous devez tenter de voler des tuiles positives de fortes valeurs ou voler des tuiles négatives de faibles valeurs afin d'affaiblir la pile de vos adversaires tout en tentant d'optimiser la votre afin de gagner. Bon filler.

A very simple and slick Knizia game and maybe one of his best. The game plays and feels nice, solid pieces and nice dice. There is enough dice rolling to make it random and enough push-your-luck elements to make it tactical. Great travel game.

EDIT: Played it again and found it a bit less exciting due to the limited player interaction. Maybe it was just bad luck but the chopsticks seem to come up at such a rare rate that the game is dominated by doing your own thing instead of caring what the others do too much

Sushizock im Gockelwok -- Played three-, four-, and five-player.

While [i]Sushizock im Gockelwok[/i] brings [i]Pickomino[/i] to mind, the two are distinctly different from one another.  Yes, they both have custom dice and dominoes.  And they both involve rolling the dice to determine which dominoes are gained and lost.  They're even similar in duration.  

In some cases, this might mean that it would be redundant to own both, but that's not the case here.  If you enjoy one enough to purchase it, then it's quite likely that the other would be a good purchase as well.

I call this game "Racist Dice".  

It boils down what little game is in the protracted Pickomino into a small digestible chunk.  The game offers a couple little decisions, so that you feel that you either played the game well or you didn't.  Still it is mostly the luck of the dice.  The points are so disparate that the game is really so swingy that luck will serve you better than skill.

All in all, it is a nice harmless little closer. that doesn't overstay its welcome.

I love this game. Party & thinking game! Incredibly fun & incredibly quick. Brilliant for being a fairly simple dice game. There are some proper hard decisions to be had and full on laughter when things go crazy :) For me its a 10.

Update: I just bought another copy, so we pick out 24 tiles to use, which randomises the number distributions of the tiles. It works really well with surprising setups!

When I played with with an international group of colleagues  everybody wanted to know where to buy the game. Two more copies were purchased in this way... I should be on commission :)

A fun little filler.  Heavily luck dependent, of course, but with some definite strategies needed for making use of the luck you get.  But if you're screwed by the dice, the best strategy in the world won't help you.  Over so quick even bad luck is relatively painless.

Is it really necessary to not look through stacks?--you'd have to have a pretty darn poor memory to be pressed to remember what's in a couple stacks of 4 or 5 for each player.  It almost seems like it would be punishment for someone who's memory wasn't so good.

The game is over before any worthwhile steals are performed.
It's suppose to be a fun drunken game.  I didn't like my "sober" game.

[Zoch 08 edition] {Food; dice-rolling, memory; optimal 4-5p} SiG is another nice Knizia dice games.  It's faster and more interactive than Pickomino but it is more convoluted.  IMHO, this is more tactical.

After several games, it seems a strategy is prominent - grabbing sushi morsels first and then the bones.  Without the morsels, one cannot get points.  As a result, the game becomes a 2-phase game: first a competition of good morsels and then a competition of bones.  In between, one has to get a chance to steal good morsel / bone from opponents.  Or, one can game on the luck for 4+ chopsticks to get good piece.  Nevertheless, the game is less dynamic than I was expected.

The tiles are very sturdy but the graphic is dull. The dice are not durable and easily get dirty after a few games.

Nice little filler game that doesn't out stay it's welcome. Lasts about 20 minutes and is good fun. It's all about getting the right dice rolls really, but you can play it with a little tactics.

Played this a couple of times now. It's simular to Heckmeck but different enough for us to own (and want to play!) both. In this game stealing tiles is even more important. You have to balance the plus and minus tiles or at least steal/take plus tiles so you opponents doesn't have them.

This feels faster/easier than Heckmeck because you can just throw the dice, no counting involved.

For whatever reason (must be theme, I guess), I liked this game quite a bit more than Pickomino.  It's still got a lot of randomness with a "pick on other players" mechanism, which generally isn't my cup of tea, just because I want new players and non-gamers that I am playing with to get into gaming.

RATING: 6
Fast light dice filler, great for cramming into corners. Rolling dice is fun, there's a little bit of tile-stealing going on and a nice fast game clock. 

The game has two twists, tiles can only be collected from or near to one end of a random row, and during the game, players each strive to balance the number of positive and negative tiles because extra positive ones don't count.

This is a little less good that Heckmeck/Pickomino for me because it does less well at giving an illusion of control (and limits your options fairly severely). It's still perfectly playable to avoid Heckmeck getting stale.

Susizock or pickomino? Pickomino or Sushizock?  This is my ongoing decision.  I love them both and so I've kept them both.  Good thing two as between them I'm played them 36 times, so the choice keeps them fresh.  

Another light-weight beginners game that has great choices in it.  Yes sometimes you get done over by the dice but most of the time you have decent choices and can't blame the chance element.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent filler that I seem to be decently good at because it's so luck-based. The only real strategy seems to be which dice to keep later in the game and a little "press your luck" on getting the best tiles, but that doesn't take away too much of its fun.

If you are familiar with Pickomino, this game is instantly recognizable as another game in the "Chicken Family of Zoch" series. This Knizia dice-rolling game is light and shorter than Picknomino, but with less of a push-your-luck element to the dice rolling. In Pickomino, players usually can press their luck by rolling the remaining dice to get higher dice totals. Stealing is common and there is an element of tension in the game play where a loss of a tile can swing the game around wildly. Sushizock is probably a friendlier and shorter version of Pickomino. These two Knizia games share the same niche and can scratch the same itch.

A decent dice-rolling filler. The components are nice, the concept is cool, my only quibble is that the game tends to lose its interest towards the end once the blue tiles have run out, at which point rolling blue chopsticks is the only hope for players lagging behind. But still, this is fun and plenty accessible for non-gamers.

RATING: 6
I like the way the mechanisms work, with the two piles of dominoes and the way that you have to remove all your positives to match your negatives at the end of the game.  The dice mechanisms are nothing special, since it's essentially Yahtzee, but the way the tile stacks work is unique.  It's clearly a Knizia design, with the mathiness and different scoring methods, but it works.  It's just a little dry.  Given the number of tiles and the way they tend to get distributed, the game probably works better with 4 than with 5, and 3 might be workable, as well.

A good dice-roller that is push-your-luck, like Reiner's Decathlon.  Added feature is that you can steal from other players.  Very helpful if you can remember where the good tiles are in their stacks.  Plays very well with 2 and 3.

Better than Pickomino i'dd say. It gives you more options and a little less dice rolling. Still alot dice rolling, which I like, but you dont have to wait long for someone elses turn. Together with more tactical decisions and the quicker play makes this a more fun game for me. Still very easy to teach non-gamers.

A simple dice rolling game. Like the pieces. Maybe too simple in that you get to take something each round, makes it feel very luck driven to me. Prefer Pickomino, much more fun and it feels like you have more control.

Ideal filler for 2-3 players if you like dice games. I this game more fun than Regenwormen / Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck / Pickomino because it's faster and there is more interaction through the stealing of each others tiles.

Very nice entry in the pickomino family. What am I saying? this is the best of all the family! It doesnt take much to end, it is very mean and keeps the nice sensations and tension of a push your luck, but adding some nice decision when keeping dice and when choosing which action perform. Absolutely must have for pickomino lovers but also for people in need of a fun fast filler

Played once (with 5 players). In my eyes, a successful reworking of Pickomino. The game is much shorter, while Pickomino tended to drag a bit, especially with lots of players. Also, the individual player turns are easier. Maybe there isn't much thinking left in the game, but there wasn't a lot of it in Pickomino anyway, and it still looks like a pleasant filler.

RATING: 7
Many people are vocal about preferring this to Pickomino, but I'm the other way around. I like the goal of rolling high in pickomino; in Sushizock you want to hit a target of a specific number of sushis or bones, but often the "best" roll for you is so easy to achieve that your turn becomes easy. Still a nice game.

Great dice game with some hard choices. Truly enjoyable, and good with children, but it's even better with gamers. It's basically a gamer's version of Heckmeck. Don't get fooled by the cute graphics, play this with your gamer buddies as a filler. Great stuff!

It is both simpler, and trickier to play than Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck. It offers more ability to steal, and mess with the other players, and not quite as big a push your luck element, but both games are fun. I may prefer Sushizock with fewer players still than Heckmeck, perhaps 3 for the former, and 4 for the latter.

Add me to the chorus of people claiming this is better than Pickomino.  The addition of a bone stack makes the game a lot more interesting to play, and often with unexpected (and funny) results.  I still rate it mediocre because I'm just not the type of audience for this.  I think the underlying decision/approach to it never changes.  One session is pretty much the same as another, the only difference is how well you roll versus everyone else.  I realize it's just a filler, but there are definitely more meaningful ones I'd rather waste 20 minutes with.

Variante de Pikomino, pero peor. Sosote.

RATING: 6
This is a nice descendant of Pickomino / Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck.  The die-locking mechanism is completely identical.  This time the roll screwage comes not in the form of "you must have worms", but in requiring you to be able to do something.  If you can't, you take the worst negative on the table.  The dice themselves have not values, but abilities, which if rolled in sufficient number permit you to either take a sushi bit in a specific position, take a bone in a specific position, take the top sushi from an opponent, take the top bone from an opponent, take any sushi from an opponent, or take any bone from an opponent.  Since you only score as many sushi (positive) as you have bones (negative), but score all your bones, you have huge incentive to take the most positive sushi and bones, but timing which to do when can be challenging.

Like its predecessor, the game length depends heavily on how much theft goes on.  Still, nice little game.

Note:  The tiles are about half the thickness of Pickomino's.

After 2+ Plays: That bits are really nice, but that's about it.  It basically boils down to a bland push-your-luck game in which the risk/reward rate isn't high enough to generate any excitement.  I would rather play the similar Pickomino, though I'm not very fond of that game either.

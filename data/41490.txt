A solitair (planning tool) air combat game in "Phantoms", just as its predecessor "Hornet Leader". 

The only mishap for an old Recce-Dude: THERE ARE NO RECCE-missions in the scenarios outlined :-((

Actually a MUST for me, but still had no chance until now to get it to me...

Rating shows that I played and *enjoyed* the game VERY much! I was wondering why I haven't bought this nice little gem even before? 
Here is the link to the Vassal-module:

A *must* for every Phantom-lover...

I don't particularly enjoy solo gaming, and really haven't played many, either. But I liked this one enough to spend some time with it. The rules are simple, but I found the game very tough at first. So when I finally started doing better it felt very satisfying.

RATING: 9
Simply superb. You don't need an in-depth knowledge of the history and you definitely don't need to have played any other Leader games.

I'd highly recommend giving it a go, and then pre-ordering Carrier Ops at dvg.com (the 80's - modern equivalent)

The rules are simple and elegant - the game has a strategic campaign layer with several different options and settings. I thought being limited to one theatre would be stale but this is not true. There is a lot of variance between the campaigns - particularly the distinction between USN and USAF.

The tactical layer is tense and unforgiving to poor choices, but never feels random. The choices made in the strategic level directly affect your abilities in the tactical missions, and your performance here directly affects your future strategic options.

For existing HL2 fans, I would still recommend picking this up. The different aircraft and different ordnance options do make a difference, and the tactical options during missions feel very different (sites feel much more dangerous and tend to be mostly low altitude but so are most bombs). The politics track is a novel idea that works well with the time period and adds a layer of frustration (sometimes you are forced to take a day off just to wait for the political situation to cool). All in all, it is different enough, but with the same magic as Hornet Leader 2.

I think I still prefer HL2, just, which is why this is a 9, but Phantom Leader is the best *boxed* solitaire air combat game there is, bar none (until Carrier Ops!).

Played this recently: a very elegant gaming system, easy to pick up, and enjoyable. I began with the War in the South campaign, which became rather straight-forward after the first few missions. Looking forward to enjoying the challenge of more complex missions in the later campaigns. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants an easy and enjoyable solitaire campaign.

I am more impressed with each one of Dan Verssen's game that I play.  The rules are incredibly easy to grasp.  The play aids are excellent.  The cards and counters and clear and sharp.  Best of all, the man is a wizard at creating fun operational solitaire games.  The A.I. is tough without being impossible.  The decisions are tough.  You can't "game" the game.  It is a great system.

RATING: 10
The Hornet Leader II system is a streamlined version of the original Hornet Leader, with quite a bit of the air-to-air combat sub-system removed, but with additions to the running of campaigns with more feedback from the results of missions to the ongoing campaign. A definite improvement.

Phantom Leader is the first boxed game using the HL2 system, which I suspect makes it acceptable to wider range of potential buyers than the earlier PDF/Vassal HL2 & expansions and Corsair Leader. Personally I have them all.

Phantom Leader is Vietnam era, so the workhorse is the Phantom rather than the Hornet (the clue is in the title!). The Phantom is far less versatile than the Hornet so you'll need to make use of other aircraft types in your squadron - similar to pre-1983 HL2 campaigns with the CAG and Cold War expansions when the Hornet was unavailable.

The twist this time being that there are separate decks for the USAF (with F-105 and Wild Weasel, F-100, F-104 and EB-66) and USN (with A-4, A-6, A-7, EA-6A and F-8) in addition to the F-4.

Campaigns are available for 65 War in the South, 67 Rolling Thunder and 72 Linebacker. In 65 AIMs are not available but neither are SA-2 and bandits, so you get a smaller squadron to allow for this.

The USAF F-4 have GBU and AIM-7 available from 67, but you'll need F-105 in 65 and 67 to use Bullpup AGM, and Wild Weasel in 67 and 72 to use Shrike ARM and the unarmed EB-66 in 67 and 72 for EW (and which may be added 'for free' to any mission, fatigue permitting). Apart from the F-4 and EB-66, the other planes are considered inferior and you get Special Option points in compensation to buy advanced weapons (CBU, BLU and Bullpup in 65; Bullup, Shrike, GBUs later) and advantages such as additional recon to increase the number of potential targets. In HL2, your compensation was a free pilot promotion - although you can spend SO on this too! F-100 and F-104 cannot carry ECM pods when they become available in 67.

The USN F-4 can carry no GBUs, so you'll need A-4, A-6 or A-7 (the latter from 67 on) to use Bullpup and Walleye AGM and Shrike ARM - the A-6 can also use GBUs. From 67 on the EA-6A Electric Intruder is available for EW. The A-4 and F-8 are considered inferior, and in 65 the A-6 superior (with VP penalty). The F-8 cannot carry ECM pods.

Certain weapons (CBU, BLU-1 and Rockets) are more effective against 'soft targets' including SAM, AAA and infantry sites but napalm gives you a bad press - and Politics are a factor in the targets you are allowed to attack. There are also events that can restrict use of weapons, such as AIM-7 at long range.

So out of the box there's quite a bit of variety in aircraft and capabilities in Phantom Leader, more so than vanilla HL2, although for the time being each pilot/aircraft has only one card, so promotion in extended campaigns is more limited, but that should change.

I'd have no hesitation in recommending Phantom Leader, even if you already have the rest of the series, and I believe it is money well spent.

An excellent combination of chrome and playability, analysis and excitement, this game is at the top of the solitaire genre for me right now.
Phantom Leader is a game that really takes advantage of the solo genre. Unlike many solitaire games, Phantom Leader substantially rewards planning over luck. In a multiplayer game, I could not spend 20 minutes planning out my turn without losing all of my gaming friends. In Phantom Leader, this planning is encouraged, and is actually very enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Take your USAF or USN squadron on missions to bomb targets in Vietnam during the war there. The game lives on the narrative generated during the missions (all those when everything goes wrong moments...) and the attachment to your developing roster of pilots.

It has a fun, simplified mission resolution mechanism (but which can get a bit repetitive after a while). But it's really a stress management simulation... alright, kind of (but it is in fact one of the important aspects of the game - knowing who to take on a mission and who to leave on the ground is one of the toughest choices in the game). Of course, flying the actual missions and blowing stuff up is where most of the fun is.

A good game to break out for a spin every now and again, it's just a shame it doesn't have a complete roster of pilots for all experience levels like the newer Hornet Leader.

Initial Impression (IOS version): Solid solitaire game. I enjoy the planning and execution. Im frustrated by how the game seems plot against me. 

The strongest part of the game is seeing how your group of pilots and your force's attributes improve by success in given missions. 

The game doesnt seem to have serious problems at first glance. Though I could see the game itself getting repetitive, especially with how short the campaigns are.  Twelve days (I think that's the longest one) doesn't seem long enough to have your squad's story play out fully.

Aside from being a very high quality (in both excellent gameplay experience and components) wargame, this version of the Hornet Leader series gives you the "bonus" of introducing the frustrations experienced by the US military as they had to fight both the North Vietnamese underneath them and the American political machine's handcuffing decisions behind them. The game seamlessly integrates the political restrictions placed on US military brass such as off-limit targets, restrictions on the use of decisive weapons due to negative media reaction, and preventing the air planners from placing their bomb sights on targets too close to the Chinese border, just to name a few. While this may frustrate some gamers, it will give those who are interested in the air war over Vietnam a fairly accurate sense of the struggle between military and polticians that so heavily affected this conflict's outcome. A must have for lovers of the series and gamers of the era.

This game is now easily in my top 5 solitaire games! Once you get a feel for the different weapons and enemy sites, this becomes a strategic and in depth experience that flows beautifully! I must admit it has a bit of a learning curve, but finally grasping this game is somewhat of a light bulb moment. Highly recommended if you ever play or want to play a solitaire game and have even the slightest interest in the aircraft of the Vietnam War era.

RATING: 7
A unique thematic wargame. Need to play the full campaign to decide how much randomness is in the game. With the 1965 short/medium campaigns, the result is highly determined by the random draw of targets/sites and dice roll. 1967 becomes epic combat battles with lots of tactics involved. Could opt to play LotR LCG if not for the intriguing theme.

Nice improvement over the much older Hornet Leader system, but very similar to the DTP/VASSAL only HL2.

I've been looking forward to this since it was called Thud Leader on the GMT P500.

RATING: 8.5
El juego tiene mucho potencial: puedes elegir el armamento de los aviones, los pilotos del escuadrón(cada uno de ellos diferentes), las misiones son muy diferentes y hay bastantes (más de 30). Me recuerda a un juego de la Sega Satur al que jugaba, se llamaba Firestorm. Thunderhawk 2. 

Quizás en lo que falla algo es en rejugabilidad: una vez que conoces los pilotos, ya sabes que hay algunos que son unos tirillas y no los coges y otros que son más todoterreno. No obstante, también es cierto que cada vez la disposición de los enemigos es diferentes, cada campaña seguro que te va a salir con objetivos diferentes y además puedes realizarle ajustes de dificultad. 

-----

In several ways it reminds me my favourite Sega Saturn Videogame: Firestorm. Thunderhawk 2. You have to choose suitable weapons for each target, you have to flight at the adecuate altitude, each enemy has different features...

Shortcomings? Perhaps not too much replayable, once you know the pilots it is easy to see the best ones...Also, there are few pilots for some skill rating, like newbie or green (although you have a lot of average pilots to choose). However, each campaing has a diffent setting (different weapons, different special operation points, different weight and stress modifiers...) especially if we consider the difficulty adjustment options.

RATING: 8
Great components, interesting campaigns, and a fantastic solitaire experience.  The original Hornet Leader (along with Rise of the Luftwaffe) was the game that made me take notice of Dan Verssen.  Phantom Leader has all of the fun of the original HL and then some.  The new political values assigned to targets adds a new layer of depth with very little accompanying complexity, as does the option of playing the 'grand campaign'.  A must-have for fans of solitaire wargames.

This one remains a toss up for me.  Production is nice, artwork is evocative, and the counters are high quality.  DVG solitaire games somehow come off as having rather shallow decisions to be made in them (I previous owned and sold Rommel and Alexander after a few plays).  I love the theme and the mechanics are well executed, but the game just sort of feels flat - either I will roll well and win, or I won't.  I will have to give a long campaign a try before I can make a final verdict.

Very good solo game, with about the perfect ratio of process to fun. Generates a better narrative than you would expect, given that the chances for pilot advancement are relatively rare, and that a pilot can only promote once. Political and recon systems add good flavor with minimal rules overhead. The system is clean and committed to memory after your first couple missions. Every target is a little tactical puzzle made more interesting by campaign-level considerations. Game seems to shine best in the long campaigns but you can comfortably knock off even a long scenario in a couple sittings. Momentum is critical to campaign success as keeping those Intel and Recon tracks up high can be pivotal. Longer/later year campaigns are definitely more challenging. Turned me into a vicious war criminal demanding napalm for every mission. Love it so far!

Hornet Leader's older but littler brother. The sparsity of weapon counters is a drawback, and the fact there are only 3 campaigns which are very similar. But, the system is a good one and flying with older planes in a hotter war is very fun indeed. The Deluxe Edition preportedly fixes the lacking elements of this game butI think having one of the Leader Series is enough. If I got a second it would be Thunderbolt/Apache because is plays quite differently.

I like this game more than my rating might indicate, but I tend to rate solitaire-only games a bit lower since I prefer playing FtF... just letting you know my bias.  

But this game is very good.  The campaigns are fun, the target runs can sometimes be intense, and I feel some emotional connection with my team of pilots.  The decisions about which target to select, which pilots to take, how to arm them, and how to approach the target are all fun.  The tactical decisions made during the run are generally less interesting (but still fun)to me since I'm just following the plan (unless something goes seriously wrong, or a very disruptive event comes up, both of which sometimes happen).
 
I really don't like the fact that the pilots do not have all skill levels.  I rate Hornet Leader: Carrier Operations one half point higher at an 8 even though it is very similar to Phantom Leader because each pilot does have all skill levels available.  

I sold my copy and pre-ordered the deluxe version.

Rich and fun.  Yet not tedious and overly complicated.  Very clean and logical rules.
Tough choices all the time, many decisions that matter, so many possibilities despite not very complex rules.  I'm amazed.

And the climate is great.  You can REALLY feel like a squadron commander during Vietnam War (selecting targets, pilots, weapons, working out precise tactics for each mission, dealing with unexpected events during missions and political limitations).
  Use napalm or cluster bombs and you might not have political support for future missions.  Use electronic counter-measures/planes and you have better chance to avoid enemy fire, but they take up precious slots for weapons/planes so you might not have the proper firepower.  Many decisions and details like that add A LOT of flavour the game.
So far I'm impressed.

EDIT: Regarding _US_Navy_campaigns_: the standard difficulty level of the game (Average; no advantages and disadvantages) is too easy.  You HAVE TO limit these powerful long-range missiles (AGMs) and the best way to do this is to choose the option of having fewer SO points at the start of campaign.  Condsider using other disadvantages too...
This is the way to bring real tension into the game.  Otherwise it's too obvious to fire these long-range missiles with almost nothing to worry about.


EDIT 2: After playing 3 different long campaigns I'm full...

As a long time fan of Hornet Leader II fan, this game can't go wrong.  I think it's a notch above HL II because of some additions to the basic gameplay.  And less "smart" weapons makes it more challenging.

Sturdy and beautifully illustrated game.  I love how streamlined the game is, and that each mission can be played in under an hour (sometimes 30 minutes).  The political index and political events add some interesting stuff to the game.

The first solitaire game I ever played, and a great one it is. Given that Hornet Leader is longer both to set up and play, this one still has its place as a more straightforward playing experience.

RATING: 8
A fantastic solitaire war game about the Vietnam air war.

The targets and their air defense make for some very challenging play that gets you all tense and riled up. So many things can happen that just making it out a live to fight another day is a victory. And let's not forget to mention the fun meta game of picking your load-outs for each mission!

A great way to spend some time gaming alone.

Directing a squadron of planes in a series of missions over Vietnam makes for a fun experience, though it can be somewhat lengthy. At half an hour per mission I haven't yet summoned up the courage to tackle a really long game (in which managing pilot stress becomes a key factor).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial impressions are very favourable. Was expecting this to be a well-produced solo time filler but it offers a really sweet balance of excitement, strategic decisions and narrative. Surprised that even the shortest campaigns have their own flavour and problems to offer interesting decisions, and that means you can effectively use this game to fill whatever play time slot you have available. I'd have liked to have seen some more factual historical targets, and a better tie-in between event names and effects, but that's nit-picking. Rules are simple but could be clearer in places.

A very exciting solitaire game that I love getting on the table.  The thrill of being a fighter pilot is exhilarating and I love how the missions click together and how a string of seemingly random missions can solidify itself into a wonderful story/campaign.  

Plus, its easy to learn... and since its solitaire, I don't have to go look for an opponent and I don't have to teach anyone else the rules.

Another Solo DVD game. I like the improvements that have been made from the Hornet Leader game. It adds a bit more depth without adding a whole lot of rules. 
I like the campaign lengths. This is a must for solo war games.
Campaign play is even more compelling. I repeat this is a must for solo war gamers.

RATING: N/A
Update: You have to be frustration-resistant with this one, as luck plays a big role in the individual missions (it does level out a bit in the long run). I played a really frustrating game and managed to score good (which is great in this game) but it was really frustrating to keep rolling ones.
BTW: the +/1 1 Pilot/VP is a _must_ if you want to have any chance at a "great" result.
Nice game, not a lot of decisions but some interesting ones. The amount of pilots can be daunting, though (I just go for random deployment to save time).

***

Only one play (and a short one on top of that), but I would say the game has a very "VPG-y" feel to it (or the other way around), the big difference being the impressive quality of the components in PL. I'll have to play this a bit more to see it that alone justifies the price difference :)
It seems a bit luck dependent, but that is to be expected from a solitaire game and, a bit like Carrier or Silent War, I suppose the longer the campaign, the lesser will luck swings kill your game (so until I haven't played a long campaign no whining about luck!!)

RATING: 7
Like Hornet Leader the game is a management puzzle of effectively building a team of pilots and successfully undertaking a series of military strikes in one of the campaigns provided. It's much like a football management game aimed at modern military aircraft enthusiasts. You build a team of pilots of varying abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Planes are many of the Vietnam favourites I played TSR's Air War with when I was a kid, so they're very familiar to me. Then you arm them with all the varied weapons, air to air, air to ground - all in various forms and all carefully selected based upon weight points your planes can carry and the targets you've selected to strike. On the way to the target you'll deal with bandits and ground defences. Once you've negotiated all that you'll need to strike your target or targets with enough ordinance and precision to destroy it for a successful mission. Then you have to get back to base.

So, like in any good football manager game, you'll have to deal with fatigue (here it's stress) in your pilots. Manage it well and your pilots will perform optimally and improve. This is one of the main challenges in the game. Scenarios are designed to make it a challenge and once you start playing you'll immediately see the value in mixing your attack group on any mission with fast attack pilots, or spending Situational Awareness (SA), to get the jump on the bandits. Use your pilots strengths and arm them accordingly. Manage your team.

There's masses of choices to be made here. Decisions to be made in both the planning and execution of a mission. Decisions that will affect the whole campaign. For instance, before a mission you can spend Special Option (SO) points (currency in the game), to use better planes, or improve your pilots, or carry certain weapons. Choose inferior planes and get some SO points back in the bank. Use those SO points after a mission to reduce stress on your pilots. What are you going to arm your planes with? Too many air to air missiles and you mightn't have enough firepower to eliminate the target. Too few air to air missiles and you mightn't even reach the target. Will you use your best air to ground pilot on an easy mission, or give him a day to rest before whatever might be assigned to you tomorrow? Will you expend valuable ordinance to make a suppression attack or risk a hit? Will your pilots increase their stress levels and undertake evasive manoeuvres, or risk it and power onwards to the target area?

The big difference between Phantom Leader and Hornet Leader lies in the political target choices. It's another level of management in the game. Whether you strike the big juicy targets or the less interesting ones, you still have to get your pilots back to base or else it's a bad day (imagine how the captured/dead pilots feel). Because the US planes are less dominant in this era the task is a more deadly proposition. Most of all you'll be looking for targets that allow you a political overkill bonus. If your political level gets too low by continually going after the high political targets then you'll be stuck having to fish for extra targets by spending SO points for the chance to hit a low VP low political target.

After several plays I've found the USN a lot less challenging than the Air Force, but more fun due to more plane variation. SO points are a little too generous for the USN and the 1972 Air Force long campaign in particular is rather dull when it comes to selecting from the limited number of pilots on offer. Hopefully the Deluxe version of the game will offer more pilot choices to make each campaign interesting. Hornet Leader is the winner here when it comes to scenario selection.

Knowing Hornet Leader meant I found the rules easier to follow. Still, I would have set them out slightly differently. The best way to learn is to give them a quick read through and then jump right into a short mission. By the middle of that mission you'll know 95% of what there is to know. By this point the game will be flowing smoothly and quickly. While it's all fairly low complexity I'd certainly say that previous knowledge of these planes and weapons will make it much easier to play and to enjoy. If you know the difference between a Sparrow and a Sidewinder already then you're probably the target market for this game and you'll enjoy it if you like solo games. If I was a fan of solo gaming I'd probably rank this a 9 or 10, but a 7 ranking isn't bad and solely reflects my personal luke warm feelings about solo gaming. On the iPad I'd give it an 8, but that's a personal preference of not having to fiddle with counters over the tactile feel of cardboard. The extra point is down to the rules enforcement and how it makes the experience easier. Each mission (with the Air Force especially), makes for an interesting puzzle and pieces of the puzzle for the long campaign.

Here's the thing: This is a game for gamers who have an interest in the subject. It's a game for gamers who don't mind shuffling counters around and rolling dice to determine event resolutions. But most of all it's a game for solo gamers - not the computer fast action solo gamer - solo gamers who enjoy managing a football team of strike aircraft pilots who like blowing things up and getting home to tell the tale... to... themselves.

I keep thinking about this game.  Completed my first short campaign last night.  It plays very quickly and simply once you get the play sequence down.  Bumped up from a 7 to an 8

[original comment]
This is my first attempt at solo wargaming.  I'm not sure it's my cup of tea.  I feel a little strange sitting there by myself and feel that it would be much more fun to play along with a companion.

I also have an alarming tendency to notice my rule mistakes just after I make a horrible roll, thus tempting me severely to back up "in order to get it right."

Great Game from a system that is a must for those who enjoy solo war games.  Bought it for my father who was an RF-4 crew Chief with the 16th TRS in Vietnam 65-66.  Simple system that plays quickly like Hornet Leader. Games are varied so two strikes against the same target tend to evolve quite differently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very much like all the decisions that occur this game.  It is fun to look at the puzzle of the target you must destroy and figure out the best load to give your guys the best chance of completing the mission.

But then during the mission, you have a bit more leeway if things go wrong, or events happen a certain way to adjust to the situation and hopefully still complete the mission.  You have to take all this information in hopefully even before sending the planes in the air.

Actually, This game turns out to be all about planning after a while.  Your plan has to include for contingencies, but because of politics there is sometimes not enough political points available to do so, so it really becomes more about hoping your draws are okay to not destroy what you were trying to do.  I think in the end, Hornet Leader is the better version of this.

One play so far, trying to get a feel for this sort of game.  Obviously a lot less fiddly than the last solo wargame I played (Silent War) but picking through the counters is still a bit of a pain so I'm not sure it's for me; after playing one mission I'm not feeling enthusiastic to play again.

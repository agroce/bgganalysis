Excelente juego sobre la batalla de La Ardenas. Todas las reminiscencias de la batalla, fog of war, completo orden de batalla en formato manejable y todo ello con solo 12 páginas de reglas. Solo la mala calidad del mapa impide que sea el juego perfecto.

RATING: 7.5
VITW ystem, with supply rules fairly straightforward. Looking forward to clearing some table space to give it a go soon.

After owning this for a number of years, finally commencing play Aug 2011, via Vassal. After around 6mths of solid playtesting of the same designers upcoming VCS Salerno game( MMP), the system is pretty much second nature.

Rating based on set up and initial impressions. We'll see how it progresses. I'm not a big fan of Bulge games, but I really like the system.

Simulation of a great battle using a great system. What more can you ask for? How about this: a designer that passionately supports his game on ConsimWorld, BGG, and at conventions.

I played a lot of bulge games, and this is one of my favorites.  Graphics could be better but this is a joy to play.Carry over from the SPI victory in the West system, with hidden strength.  Good use of combined arms tactics and the attrition of armour in sustained combat.  Just big enough with 2 maps the campaign is very playable over 2-3 sessions.  Go out and get a copy and don't let the graphics detract from a great game.

This is a great game that I had on preorder for 3 years. Big but not monster...complex but not rocket science..and works with 4. Only thing keeping it from 8 or above rating is size of space needed for play but more importantly, having to track the units with special abilities....we missed some opportunities with them..but with a little effort and replay that probably becomes second nature. I played with four but may soon replay with 2.

Please see my full review on the game's main page.  This game keeps getting better the more I play it.

Great components, simple rules, deep gameplay based on hidden unit strengths.  Do you need another Bulge game?  The answer is yes.

(2007-11-02) Played part of a game with a friend late last year.  I thought it was interesting and playable, though I have a concern that the range of chit strengths for the units is to wide.

Just don't be fooled by the one map. This is a monster game and requires some real commitment. That said, it is fun and simple, captures some nice Bulge feel, and is a fine iteration of the VitW system.

Iron Tide nicely captures the feel of the battle by using a somewhat  unpredictable CRT, fog of war, reserve movement, elegant bridge blowing rules and extensive playtesting. When I reach for a Bulge game to play this is the one I choose cause it strikes a fine balance between ease of play, complexity and FUN.

Quick playing bulge game with just enough chrome to keep it interesting. Uses a streamlined VitW system of unit strength chit pulls to keep the replayability and suspense high. Made Vassal module.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Not too many rules.  Very interesting "strength" mechanic, as units are "rated" then draw their str out of a cup when they enter battle.  Mixed with a "cryptic" CRT modified by column shifts provides for uncertainty in battle.  Quite good. Chrome comes in the form of engineers, bridge blowing and building and fuel dumps.  Also some special rules for 101st, SS armour etc.

Very good -- my favorite Bulge game right now. I like how various systems like unknown unit strengths and divisional integrity shifts cause the player to think in terms of whole divisions while positioning individual regiments. There's a lot going on here "under the hood" that isn't apparent from a simple scan of the rules. Recommended without reservation for dedicated wargamers. And if you like this game, get in touch with Decision Games and make a pledge for Nathan's Salerno game ... it uses the same system as Iron Tide, and is every bit as much a labor of love for Nathan (perhaps moreso).

RATING: 8.5
Pretty solid game with a nice fog-of-war system. Map design could be clearly better though, as it's hard to spot where the bridges are and the differences between heavy and light woods or clear and rough are a little bit too subtle for comfort.

The only problem I have with this kind of wargame is downtime. But I'm pretty sure it can be a great experience if played PBEM.

Good, solid meat & potatoes wargame. Uses Balkoski's Operation Typhoon system. Just bought and played. Liked it. There are A LOT of Battle of Bulge games; this is one of the best. Hats off to the designer!

Far less scripted than some other Bulge games, our two games showed wildly different narratives.  The VitW system is fun in that the fog of war from chit-strength draws will prevent you from ever having to consider a dance of units to perfect a tired old 3:1 attack.  The CRT results aren't as linear as some are comfortable with, but since there are no DRMs it makes no difference, the key to combat being odds shifts instead.  The key to the combat isn't in the base power, but in the aforementioned CRT shifts from factors such as armor support, cohesion, artillery, terrain, etc.  The game's only real drawback is the time requirement, but Kilgore has recently included some shorter scenarios to allow for completion in a day.  Excellent for three players.  Brief rules, low complexity.  Expensive, but worth it.

The map and the detailed OBs are gorgeous. Kind of a contrast to the publisher's name "Just Plain Wargame". The price tag is relatively high to JPW's line of games as a result. For 700 counters, however, the price could well justify.  The map hex number is difficult to read because of the general forested areas. The trees hide the number. Initial start up takes a little bit time to complete. The counters are easy to punch. I think evey wargame should this as a model.  It is a nice update of an old SPI game.  Iron Tide is based on the Operation Typhoon game system in simulating the limited intelligence aspect of the war.  But the campaign on the Battle of the Bulge is not much an exciting thing to me personally.  This could be a good choice other than the big game company production like GMT's "Ardenness '44" and "Tigers in the Mist".  A quite special feature is the demolition of the bridge and fuel dumps not particularly treated in other Bulge games.  Artillery, air point, divisional integrity, mines and terrain, reserve movements after combat, reinforcements, German free placement units are all featured and if you  can manage to pull all these factors (read Dire-roll modifiers) to your advantage, then you might, and a great chance you can, achieve a major breakthrough by the German into the Ardennes forest.  This moment is the high tide of any Bulge game.  The old AH's Battle of the Bulge failed on this.  Iron Tide comes out with a better simulation effect on this.  A big advantage is you can play on a single map and not having the whole map twisted in shape like other games.  Surely a player-friendly game.  The OB organisation historical timetable on the starting position and the arrival of the units on both sides also brings us back to all those good old memory in AH and SPI days.  This is excellent stuff to me, which you cannot be satisfied by mere magazine games.  The untried unit system would be fresh to someone new to the system. However, I find it nothing more than a few randomness included as the chits pull have to be confined in the historical premises, thus rendering the majority of the strength expected most of the time. Also, the cluttering of the markers would pose a problem to the stacks. They might fall easily if you don't use plexiglass to play it.

Based on a solitaire play only.  The components are good and very functional, the fold out charts are very helpful during play.  The map is very well drawn and was asthetically pleasing to me.  I liked the flow of the rules and fealt that it portrayed the battle well.  All in all I was very impressed and I am looking forward to playing this one FtF as often as I can.  

The only downside was the condition of the game when it reached me.  Quite a few of the counters had fallen out of their counter sheets so by the time I opened the box, they were scattered everywhere even inside the rulebook.  Not the fault of the publisher but be careful when opening this one.

Boxed version is to be had.  Hidden units lead to surprises as the German "main thrust" might not be where you think it is!  Rules allow you to focus more on the game's tactics and play rather than if you have a "PhD" in the rules.

RATING: N/A
I don't find the Ardennes offensive a particularly interesting subject at the best of times, so my primary reason for obtaining this game is the system itself, being a reworking of the old SPI Victory in the West system which I find to my taste.

RATING: 9
Excellent game, easy to play and well designed and developed.  The map is a bit disappointing graphically, but about what you'd expect from PRP.  My favorite Bulge game is Ardennes '44 by GMT, followed by Iron Tide, and then Tigers in the Mist.  This game has a nice blend of old SPI charm and cleaner, more up to date mechanics and innovations.

Have only played this solitaire. I like the system and I think there are some good tweaks in this one, the use of two sets of chits to differentiate unit quality, while still maintaining some uncertainty. Also the idea that some units can draw two chits and discard one, owners choice. Graphics are okay, though gex numbers on map are hard to read.

What a fun game!  I have played it a number of times (several times against the designer) and have really felt the agony of command.  You have GOT to get this game and play it!  Best Bulge game out there (up there with Bulge 65(AH)  Sorry Nathan :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Don't tell Nathan, but based on my one time playing this, it's not a bad title at all. In fact, it appears to have a lot of replay and good suspension of disbelief, quality of really good game feel, and I liked the general play. My one criticism is that the range of values the random chits represent seem too broad for units that by this time in the war were pretty well known. The limited intel is a neat game mechanism, but undercuts the feel of the battle because this is one fight that so much is known about in great exasperating detail.

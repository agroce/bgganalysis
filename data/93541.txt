Fun and light game.  Have to agree that the artwork on the tiles was not well thought out. It can be very confusing trying to keep track of what has been renewed and what has not.  My desire to keep the game 'original' has kept me from modifying the tiles. Other than that, a fun game deserving of continual play.

RATING: 7
Pretty cool hand-management game.  Not very complicated, but plenty of interesting decisions.  The only thing I was not a fan about was the disc vs. cube ranks; it seemed counter-intuitive when scoring people at the end of the turn.  A couple of the graphic choices made the colors a little hard to comprehend too.  But still a very good game!

RATING: 7
Beautifully produced cards.  Balancing decisions around when to buy cards with money and those with workers looks to be interesting. And when to get the goal cards is another good decision to consider. 

It is hard to distinguish which building tiles are available to develop from those that are not. 

My rating could increase with more plays.

RATING: 8
Yes, the colour choices are pretty appalling. My favourite one is the colours of the specialists. For example: the specialist in charge of business buildings (I think they're called) wears a dark blue shirt....and he's in charge of the PINK buildings? A major, major graphic re-design is needed.
But apart from that significant flaw, this is an absurdly underrated game, with a most definitely pasted-on theme! It has a lot of similarities to Alhambra and Ticket to Ride, but is deeper than either. Two actions and four to choose from makes this quite challenging, although Lady Luck is definitely there in the card selection, but not quite to the same extent as Alhambra and TtR. 
It's a rather painful guessing game. Since you generally don't have any idea what goals your opponents are working on, you have to be watching their every move for hints. 
Contrary to what many are saying, the specialists are quite important, as continued possession of important ones will rake in a lot of points over the game.
Give Urbania a major graphics overhaul and I'm sure it would be more popular than Ticket to Ride! There, I've said it!

RATING: 5
This game seems to suffer from group think.  We played with little interest in the 'personalities'.  As a consequence the cards ran out in the draw pile toward the end of the game as the copin cards stayed in front of the players unspent.  I bought my target cards early, played to them and won.  But playing last also had an advantage of final choice of action.  The Vohwinkel graphics were impressive as always, except that as game graphics they were far from clear and a much more basic Cwali style would have served much better.  The TTR card draw offered nothing new.  This would have been an OK game in the 90's. but now felt dated and visually confusing.

Fun. But an error could be ending the game way sooner than it should be. Of course there is some strategy in this as well.

Tan and grey buildings too close together in colour. Not smart. Brown and red are similar as well.

RATING: 8
Similar to Ticket to Ride, but with added investments (hired specialists) and with buildings instead of trains. As others have said, the board is frustratingly impossible to read, all the colors look the same, and the artwork isn't the greatest. By far the most annoying part of the game is that money is tallied by the discard cards you keep in front of you, meaning that if everyone is hoarding their money, the draw pile gets smaller and smaller. We might fix this by using coins or poker chips next time.

On the other hand, the game is a lot better than the BGG reviews would suggest. I like the variety of the secret goals, and the specialists can really help you rack up points. The board is large enough that a two-player game is a bit too easy: I'd like to play with 3-4 to see the competition heat up a bit.

Pretty straightforward design. Nothing terribly wrong with it per se, but I didn't really see the draw either.

But the visuals... oy vey! Visual overload looking at the board. And unfortunately you need to double check stuff fairly often to make sure things are adding up correctly. Just painful to look at.

I'm also not sure about the victory cards. You draw them blind, and there's a big opportunity cost for drawing cards, so I think you always just draw 3 or 4 early and play them. Even though people will see them.

As others have said, the graphic design is disappointing.  The card drafting isn't interesting.  Half or more of the victory points come from the secret game-end mission cards, which makes defensive play harder.  Worse, the mission cards are a random draw.  If you manage to (randomly) get a mission card that overlaps with cards belonging to your opponents, lucky you.  They don't even know that they are helping you until the game is over.

This game is quick to play (45-75mins) and I kind of like it even after first play. I like fillers so this one is going to be in my collection.

[b]Components wise[/b], the buildings are made of good cardstock quality. Board doesn't stay flat when laid on the table, I mildly bent in a couple of spot in the opposite direction of the warp, so that fix it a little. 

Colour of the cubes (which represent buildings) didn't match the colour of the respective buildings on the board, as well as the cards. It was really terrible and we had to double check every single time whether the colour matches or not before increasing the point or constructing the building.

[b]Gameplay wise[/b], I think it's fun. It's filler/gateway game, so don't expect much. The game is simple but still offers good decision making and strategy.

[b]Scalability[/b], 2 players work fine as well as more. But with more than 3 players, the game can end very quickly, as well as the drawing pile seems to run out faster.

The game is maybe a 5, but the components pull it down to a 4. It's almost impossible to read what's happening on the board, given the cluttered color palette. In regards to the gameplay, it's "fair", but the inclusion of the expert character cards really comes across as a bit of an after thought. There just aren't enough actions/turns available to make them have very much impact on the game. You are always better off building a building for points and furthering your endgame goals. The scoring cards related to these character cards should just be removed from the deck all together. They are completely worthless compared to the scoring cards related to the various areas on the board.

RATING: 6
Urbania's graphic design is hideous, and seriously detracts from what is otherwise a good game. The balance of erecting buildings and hiring specialists works well, and creates multiple scoring opportunities and an interesting dynamic between the two currencies of the game. The turns are a bit short, with only two actions each, but the game moves quickly as a result.

Game that ends surprisingly quickly. That's easily Urbania's strength. NOT that it gets over quickly, but you have a lot to do in a limited amount of time. Awful board/component design. Ultimately, I thought the game was decent, but I didn't see an idea that would make me want to revisit the title.

While doesn't really have anything to do with city building, Urbania is a fun light game. You flip over building times to get points and as you flip them over you can count them towards projects. You can also bring in specialists which give you more points. The rules have a few places they could be clearer, but overall a fun game. Setup can be a bit confusing first time tough

Everyone pretty much has it right about this game: it is a very good game, but the graphic design is just terrible. The cards hard to match to the buildings, the specialists are hard to match up with their building type, it's hard to remember what a specialist costs and what it's worth. A complete mess.

Still, more people should be playing this game. It really is an interesting game, weighing building and playing cards versus getting projects and when to play those projects.

RATING: 5
I would have rated this higher if the board was easier to look at (it is way too busy with all the artwork and the colours that they picked are too close to each other - beige and grey).  It is slightly easier to play if you remove all of the "built" buildings from the board instead of just flipping them over.  The gameplay itself would have been fun if I wasn't frustrated by the colours/graphics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are some mildly engaging timing and prioritization decisions here; decisions that are amplified by the game's surprising brevity. If you've played similar games like Ticket to Ride or Airlines or Union Pacific, you'll probably think you have time to do more things before the game ends. You don't. Which is interesting, and helps differentiate a game that is otherwise a complete retread of ideas we've seen many times before from Alan Moon and others. But ultimately, the seasoned gamer will probably find that Urbania is "just another game."

I would be more willing to give Urbania a second chance if the graphic design weren't so catastrophically bad. The color matching between the cards and buildings and tokens is poor enough to cause confusion. More importantly, the building tile art is way too busy, and it's enormously difficult to quickly tell which buildings have been renovated (physically flipped over, and no longer playable) and which buildings are still playable. This issue alone is a gamebreaker for me. The situation could be remedied by simply removing the renovated buildings from the board rather than flipping them, and I highly recommend using this method. What you lose in thematic immersion will be made up tenfold in ease of gameplay. You've been warned.

Only one play so far. It's a light-medium game with straight forward rules which plays in about 45 minutes. The game is mostly about action efficiency. You have two actions each turn and you need to squeeze the most points out of them. The crux of strategy seems to be the goal cards which must be drawn as part of an action, and then played face-down as another action so that they will score at the end of the game. When playing the card it costs you 10% of your current score. Should you play early for cheap, or latter when you know what the card is actually worth?

The graphic design is pretty but not quite functional. The busy art on the buildings and the colour choices lead to many confusing moments as you try to associate the correct coloured buildings to their card and wooden bit counterparts. It's a minor issue and it seemed to bother those I played with more than it did me.

I would like to play this some more.

2012 is the year of city planning games and Urbania probably gains the title of the most overlooked one from the whole batch. It is hampered by a graphic design that actively obstructs gameplay and has players repeatedly scouring the table to find out what their cards mean or where they relate to.
Beside these niggles, it's an easy and surprisingly entertaining game. Each turn, players get 2 actions and can choose out of 4 different ones: draw cards, build, hire a specialist, complete a project (up to three times per game only). Project cards give VPs at game end. Getting the right project cards can be decisive but the game is short enough with 45 minutes that it doesn't matter too much.

Starts off looking like "Ticket to Build" and doesn't do a whole lot to shake that notion, but what it does isn't bad, and has the possibility to get downright interesting.

Urbania is Ticket To Ride with a few more bells and whistles, some of which work, some of which don’t.

Basically, everything to love from TTR is there, but a few tweaks were needed to improve flow. For starters, each player should begin with a Project card using a standard draw 2 or 3, keep 1 setup.

More importantly, a change needs to be made to the graphic design of the tiles and board. It’s too difficult to differentiate between renewed and un-renewed buildings at a glance. Because of this, Urbania has a tendency to end suddenly, as players can’t easily tell how complete a quadrant of the board may be.

Solid early entry from Luciani; much more constrained in gameplay than, say, the florid Tzolk'in or the Grand Austria Hotel luck-fun-fest, but its relative simplicity is its charm. And it still manages to challenge with decisions at tactical and strategic levels. And seems to be well-loved by the designer community, as expansions were contributed by Colovini and Morgan Dontanville (Asgard's Chosen), among others. I would stop short of saying that the game plays quickly, because while it should play in under an hour, there does seem to be some inescapable AP.

RATING: 7
Nice artwork but really poor graphic design ... it's hard to tell at a glance which buildings are legal to upgrade (ie those next to already upgraded buildings) so you need to work at determining what your valid and best moves might be. If you can get past that, it's a decent game. You collect cards (which have helmet and dollar symbols) in the colours you want to invest in , you upgrade the buildings using the helmets and buy the ability to score ongoing points in that colour using money - as you don't want to see someone else scoring points each turn for buildings that you spend actions upgrading ... but of course, if you can manage to sneak into someone else's colour, excellent! So it's a game of specialisation and takeover in a sense. Add some secret end-game scoring objectives (points per colour, or per area you build in, etc) and it's never clear who the winner will be. I could see how the game might drag a bit. The games where people have objectives for building in the same area accelerate to an end quickly and seem like a better time fit, so it's probably a bit long for what it usually offers, which is essentially draft cards, invest, buy, repeat. If it's going Euro, at least be thankful it's not round based.

This is an under appreciated gem of a game!  It's from the same guy who designed 'Tzolk'in' (same year), 'Voyages of Marco Polo' (3 years later), 'Council of Four' (4 years later), etc.  Yes, it's a lighter game than the three others I listed, but it's still a refined game that's balanced, has a neat mechanic for buying the specialist cards and determining their value, gives you solid actions to choose from on each turn, provides different strategy options each game with the project cards, and it has a lot of replayability because of the random building-tile set up at the start of each game.  It's a great game and fun to play!

Based on one play: The game appears simple upon reading the instructions and the mechanics are straight forward, creating a game similar to Ticket to Ride with a few more options. However the design choices really ruin this game. The buildings are very hard to differentiate and when renewed, you cannot even tell what type they are as the colors change and only the shape indicates the type. It is easy to forget to move a token and thus recounting occurs often and you get mixed up with all the colors and layouts. A redesign would work well or an online version.

Mechanically its ticket to ride does city planning.  Cards are used to either buy experts, develop city blocks or pick a random end of game bonus.  With lots of ways to score, its can be easy to forget certain bits.
With poor colour choice design it can be hard to not make mistakes, which was a shame.

I played the game once with 5 players, which is definitely not an amount you should play it with. Way too many. The game was over in about 6 rounds, which felt short in terms of choices you make, but the game took a really long time in terms of how long it should take.

The game design feels outdated. There is large amount of luck in card draw and availability of resources (helmets, money, and buildings). There's almost no long term strategy involved and the influence you have on the total state of the game felt fairly low.

The choice of colors and artwork is horrible, especially under low light. I was constantly trying to distinguish colors and match them with specialists and buildings. I don't understand this never came up during playtesting. A really bad design. The components also meant the game took a really long time to play.

All in all the game just didn't feel like fun and I was glad when it ended. Hopefully I don't have to play it again.

1 play, 4er (or 5er?)

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The board is a 7x7(?) grid of squares. There are a bunch of tiles representing different types of city areas -- 6 of each type (although there may be more slums?). Each type (slums, parks, etc; makes no difference, really), is a specific shape and color and fits in one square of the grid. On the backs, the tiles show the cost to build (some number of helmets, either of a specific color or any color) and a VP reward. At the start of the game, distribute these randomly on the board, then flip the 5 in the center + are over to the built side.

Players are dealt a hand of money cards, which show some combination of helmets and/or coins, which are either in one of the 6 colors or a rainbow (wild) color. The rest form a draw deck, from which you place 3 face up in display. There's also a set of 6 person cards, one for each color; set these near the board. A board is used to track the current cost to hire these people, and their VP value -- place markers on designated locations (based on random setup?). Finally, there's a deck of investment cards left face down near the draw deck.

On your turn, you take a number (3?) of actions. These could be:
- draw a card: from face up display or either draw deck (money cards or investment cards)
- invest: play one of your investment cards face down in front of you; max 3/player/game. Pay 10% of your VP (rounding down). These are end-game bonuses based on a variety of things (e.g., number of tiles flipped in specific areas of the board, current VP value of 1 or 2 of the people cards, etc.)
- develop a tile: may only develop a tile orthogonally adjacent to one already developed. Pay the cost in helmets of the appropriate color, earn the VP reward, and flip the tile on the board. If any cards you spent also have coins, place them in your display. Increase the VP value of the associated person on the display board.
- hire a person: cost, indicated on the display board, is always paid to bank in coins; may use cards from hand and/or in your display. Take the person card from wherever it is, and increase the cost of that person by one step. The first several cost bumps reward you with a card.

At the end of your turn, earn VP for each person you control, according to their value on the display board.

The final round is triggered when any corner of the board has just 2 (?) or fewer undeveloped tiles. Finish that round, then one more round (even number of turns). Calculate end-game VP bonuses from invested cards; most VP wins!

The production quality is pretty good, with nicely made tiles and cards. But there is way too much going on on the game board! The board is green, the tiles are a variety of colors, and it all just sort of blends into itself! I had a difficult time looking at the board and being able to quickly see which tiles were flipped and which were not. From a game play standpoint, I think it would be simpler to just remove developed tiles from the board, rather than flip them. Not only would it be easier to see which tiles could be flipped next, but it would be simpler determining how many of which color/shape have already been built (important for many end-game bonus cards)! That doesn't exactly fit the theme, of course; maybe they should have used bombs instead of helmets, and we could be developers clearing the ruins of a city instead of building one up?

The game is kind of interesting, but not enough for me to seek it out (especially because I found the art to be so distracting). I did like how you have to time when to play end-game cards (early costs less VP, but you have less info about which cards will actually pay off). The person-card stuff, with the increasing values and costs, was also pretty neat. Of course, you can find yourself at the mercy of the cards -- the deck is relatively small, and other people may hoard the type of cash you need to hire the people you want!

Overall, a pretty quick-playing game with some interesting mechanisms, but uninspiring and distracting artwork.

This game plays pretty similarly to Ticket to Ride but with a step up in complexity.  There is a pile of cards with build and money symbols on them in several different colors that you take into your hand and use to build structures or hire "specialists".  The cards are even splayed out with 5 showing and a hidden stack to draft from much like Ticket to Ride.

Where the game suffers most is the visual design, it's awful, one of the worst I've ever seen.  Not in that it's just ugly but the design actually detracts from and makes the game more difficult to play.  Don't get me wrong, it's ugly too, but that can be forgiven if it doesn't hinder your ability to play a good game.

First of all, of all the colors they could have picked 3 of them are different shades of tan/brown.  Granted they also put the shape of the building on the cards but that doesn't help you when you also have to keep track of three different colored cubes/disks of similar colors.  Also, along with the color and building shape the cards contain a third symbol...which is simply unneeded and provides visual clutter.  And the worst offense is the board and building tiles themselves.

The board is this ugly grassy color with roads and different colored cars driving along them and each of the buildings instead of being a solid color are a busy assortment of colors with that color being "predominant" (and remember 3 of the colors are hard to discern already).  THEN when you build that structure you flip the building over which has no predominant color and just adds to the visual noise on the board.  Something you have to keep track of because the number of structures built in a section triggers the end of the game.

Now if you get past all this (which really does affect at least my enjoyment of the game) it's a pretty average clone of a great game.  They added more complexity but without any of the charm or really strategy present in Ticket to Ride.

Ticket to Ride had a lot of interaction, blocking another player's routes is a major part of the game, as is the balance between placing trains, collecting cards, and refreshing and drafting your tickets.  In this game there is no blocking, only building a structure or buying a specialist your opponent was after (which you have no certain way of knowing), and the specialists can be bought back as long as you collect enough money (which the cards, if we were playing right, can be used twice as the building and money resource lessening the tension).  All the buildings are available from the outset so there's no real selection of what you have an opportunity to build.  It's really just going for the most efficient number of points each turn until game end, a lot less interesting than Ticket to Ride.

Not a bad game, but I'm not yet convinced that there's any great originality in the system or in the combination of mechanisms in the system.  Looking forward to playing it again, in any case.

Interesting attempt to do something a bit different with Ticket To Ride style set collection but too many fiddly bells and whistles make it confusing and the graphic design makes it hard to tell certain pieces apart.

Surprisingly engaging and devious game from Mayfair. We were very kindly given a copy at UKGE and played it the other night. Though my only criticism might be the slightly over-enthusiastic artwork and colour differentiation that might be tricky for colour blind or low VA players, the game itself is a clever little urban renewal game which rewards both short-term and long-term strategic gains, making it an interesting addition to our collection

Like Ticket to Ride with bonus victory conditions but without paths. Board is a little cluttered and tough to read, but the game play is pretty darned good. Would play when I wanted to play Lords of Vegas but had five players instead of four.

a glaring example of a good game ruined by a bad implementation. Urbania is a bit of a brain burner but it's a nice game with some original mechanics. I like most of all the fact of buying from other the specialists and in this way you make more points and you make it harder to buy them back.
Unfortunately, good mechanics aren't enough and it seems the publisher did everything in its power to make this game difficult to play. two of the colors of the building are almost identical, once the city is laid down it is very difficult to see which building are done and which are not, we had to use additional pieces taken from another game to make it more clear. cards also are printed in such a way that it is very difficult to understand the color of specialists, the place of the areas where your project must be built and so on.
I really felt frustrated by seeing a more than decent game ruined by such a sloppy production.

Busy board but I have seen post that suggest ways to fix that, and since I don't own the Viticulture expansion with the Grande' worker Urbania's meeples are in the same colours and different shapes, another reason to acquire.

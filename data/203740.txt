Very tactical and fun game. My group love it and call the game "thief pvp".
Here it is essential to buil a strategy when to steal the emperor's jewel and how to defend against the other players since they want to steal it from you too.

First play and it was fun. The action cards make all the difference and add both flavor and interesting gameplay options. Incredibly thematic with an ending that ramps up tension like few other games.

RATING: 6.5
This is my first game where one player would play against the others and the game itself as well. I would say that this kind of board game is quite extraordinary and revolutionary. The theme is a real badass, you are all thieves that would steal the most precious gems in the land. Each one has unique skills and would be helped with much useful equipment. I would say that the mechanic is something to learn easily because it is so simple yet intricating. Your luck is pushed to the end as well because you cannot predict what kind of movement would be done by the game. The downside is just that it's quite repetitive and quite boring when you play it too many times. I expect something more for the expansion, though.

Fantastic theme and exciting gameplay!
I'm already looking forward to becoming a more experienced burglar/thief in Hadria :D

A great game and one of my two highlights of Essen '16!

A nice programming game with a nice bit of player interaction and push your luck. The theme is used very well and all the actions work well within the theme. The game looks nice and the gameplay is fun.

Very beautiful, clever mechanics, enjoyable, tensed game that i like so much but still interaction cards would raise your anger. I like the game more than clank but i think it is the overpowered interaction cards made me suspicious about the game.

Different kind of take on co-op/best wins games. Brilliant timing solutions, bit of a brainburner & AP prone, lots of guessing, hard hitting cards to play on other players, but still this is extremely fun game to play, even if you know you won't win! Maybe I should rate this higher?

This game is played on a map similar to all hidden movement games such as Scotland Yard, Last Friday, etc. However movement isn't hidden, Actions are done using 10 cubes where players place more cubes to go first, like Dungeon Petz. Mixing these mechanics makes for an interesting game but overall is too random using tokens, and too easy for the person stealing the gem unless most thieves are all around him.

I can only say that I am so glad that I bought it! My first impression is that it will among the top games I've played this year and definitely the highlight of my Essen 16 purchases. 

- The theme is delivered really well
- There is no downtime 
- incredible amount of exciting gameplay, skullduggery, laughter and tension especially after the Emperor's Jewel has been stolen. 

After my first playthrough with four players I REALLY REALLY LIKE IT. I'll adjust the rating with more plays of course.

RATING: 5.4
It's quite thematic and the artwork shines. The turns feel very slow until someone gets the jewel, then it becomes more tense as everybody throws what they have saved during the game and try their chances at winning.

It's too slow, long and wild for me. The last part is nice, but unfortunately, it's not possible to enjoy it without the initial building up turns.

RATING: 5.4
Gioco bocciato perché, per il tempo che necessita, l'ho trovato sempliciotto e ripetitivo. Mi da l'idea di un gioco vecchio, prendi i soldi e scappa, un po' mi ricorda Escape fron Colditz con ambientazione differente. Entrando nello specifico trovo anche un po' sbilanciati i poteri dei 4 ladri e un forte king making. Gioco che non ha suscitato nessuna emozione che invece il colpo d'occhio lasciava presagire.

RATING: 10
One of my absolute favorite games since it's release in 2016. Cunning, secretive, tactical, simultanous, at times chaotic and always thrilling and to the last turn exciting gameplay in a nice victorian/steampunk setting with beautifully designed (although a bit small) miniatures. We have not had a game that didn't end in a heartbeat finish.

It's like if the original Robo Rally, Scotland Yard and Space Alert had a baby!

Action point allowance system. You are trying to sneak in and steal the ruby. There are guards everywhere and the other players are also trying to screw you over. There are a lot of great things about this game. I actually very much enjoyed it. Ron didn't like it as much. I know the expansion coming out might help some of the problems we had. I look forward to playing again.

RATING: 5.5
Rating based on a single demo game, without character's special abilities.

The ability of a player to do something useful with his turn seemed very dependent on the cards that were drawn. Hence, we saw some people who made little progress for a few turns, moving a slowly and trying to improve their cards, while others had interesting turns with smart plans to get past the guards and grab some treasure.

You know that scene in the heist movie when all the plans have hit the fan and the team has to improvise their way through the ensuing chaos? That, but with crossbows & flame grenades.

The game is pretty random, but I still like it :) Feels like an adventure, almost like Hollywood movie scenario at times. The emotions are great, but you have to get through rulebook, which, to be completely honest, is not well written.

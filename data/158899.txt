Not to add my opinion to the crying hordes, but of all the great games that came out in 2014, I'm a little surprised this one was declared game of the year. I really like Camel Up (2013's winner), but this I though was merely 'okay', not one I would seek out to play a second time.

Colt Express is more than just a simple programming game, it's more to memorization & deduction once you have more plays. 

What I learn from Colt Express this weekend:
1) Do not take revenge
2) Do not be greedy
3) Do not take what is not yours
4) Avoid fighting, take peaceful solution
5) Let others do your dirty job!

Very fun action programming game. The theme, the actions, the looks, the cactuses, basically everything is oozing fun. I do not even care if I do not win as long as I can run around shooting and punching other players.

Ok, maybe the above tells that Colt Express does not have too much depth but it is an excellent retreat from deep thought games. But still it manages to offer meaningful decisions.

Pretty clever bluffing/role-selection game.  Very cool-looking components.  The play is a little unintuitive, though: you are semi-planning moves up-front, but then you have limited control when the moves go into effect.  Memorization helps a little, but I find it more fun if you just forget this after the first move each round.  Silly fun.

Very much depends on the group being played, but a combination of factors led to me not liking this game.

* beginner rules have you shuffle your hand+discard+undrawn cards each round, resulting in no guarantee that all cards are seen (I never drew marshall cards, and only had 2 horizontal movement cards all game)
* Belle's ability is very strong in a 5-player game
* Early rounds make a huge difference with bullet cards being doled out and affecting every following turn

The randomness of the game also led to constraints, such as lack of early movement means limited targets and severely limited loot options, and spending an action to draw more cards left you as a sitting duck.

Would not need to own, and would not seek to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tricky up front, but who can resist those little cardboard trains? The meeples and treasure pieces work so well with it. 

This is a "program your moves" kind of game, but what I like about that is when it's time for you to execute a desired move, you still have flexibility to tweak it just a little bit. A "run" can mean run into a car in front of OR behind you, a "climb" can mean climb up on to OR down into a car. Want to shoot or punch someone? You may have unexpected choices there, too. 

I love the randomness of things going slightly wrong and the domino effect that results. We did miss the first few "special events" that happened on account of the easy-to-miss, small icons on each round card, and the rules did take some time to decipher up front.

That said, my expectations were really high, but they weren't quite met (especially for a SdJ winner-- but doesn't that happen with any awarded game?). The folks I played with had a decidedly "reserved" vibe about them. I need more plays to determine if this is stronger or weaker.

Positives
- Yes, I do love gimmicks, and the train cars are worthwhile ones
- Flexibility in executing a programmed move can help recover from an unforeseen "accident" that occurs before you can move
- Lots of random shooting, punching and looting-- over the top silliness

Negatives
- Rules can be a bit intimidating to newcomers, but they'll get it after one game
- Shooting mechanic doesn't really make sense-- getting shot should be a much more brutal occurrence but it just slows you down a little
- People who love rules over chaos may get frustrated with this one
- It can sometimes be a little tricky to pull or place your characters and treasure tiles out of or into the little cars

RATING: 8
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Another solid choice for the Spiel des Jahres. First of all the visual impact of the game is great! The artwork, the 3D train, the meeples... everything is just beautiful when it's set up on the table. The theme is not one of my favorites, but it's nice and I guess that it would work very well in a family setting.

The game-play, while maybe nothing really innovative, is crazy and fun. I like the solution of putting the cards in a communal pile and flipping it at the end to resolve the programming... it makes everything run so smooth! I also like the fact that every round is a little different thanks to the cards, which introduce every time a small new mechanism to the game-play. Of course there's really not much strategy and depth in Colt Express, but on the other hand the game offers a great deal of chaos, excitement and craziness instead!

All together Colt Express is a great family game. It does everything right to be a perfect fit for that setting: it's easy to play, it's beautiful, it's exciting and it's quick enough to be played a couple of times in a row. The Spiel des Jahres committee really couldn't make a better choice. I like this game a lot!

[b]26.11.2014 - after 1 play[/b]
COLT EXPRESS is a game set in a Wild West background, with players taking the roles of bandits, trying to steal as much money as possible from a running train. Each character has a unique ability and every player has the same action cards that are used in order to "program" their moves.

The thing that makes this game stand out (literally) is the 3D cardboard train, that acts as a spatial gameboard, on which players make their moves. Although the card stock for the cards is flimsy, the train is made from sturdy cardboard and has a potential for capturing the attention of people not playing the game.

By using this "gizmo", the theme is integrated well into the game, as players can ride on top of the train, shoot from a cart to another or ride the engine.

Gameplay wise, it is a game of backstabbing, guessing and counter-guessing, in which the level of luck is very high. The fun factor is also high, as you might find yourself doing things that you never thought you would do, because of the continuous change of the game. Because of these, some players could not like it and refuse to play it a second time.

+ The train "board"
+ Light and funny
- Too much luck for some
- Poor Cardstock for cards
- The "Gunslinger" title ($1000 for the one that uses the most bullets) seems overpowered

I may play it again if in the right mood

OMG do not play with the 2 player rules in the book.  Awful. Just play 2 characters each, SO much better.

That said, I don't think I would pull this out without 5-6 players.  There are so many great 4 player games, this is in my collection to help when we have more than 4 and want something light and fun.

I really enjoy the game with 5 and 6, but my wife is not a huge fan so it rarely gets played unless one of our guests specifically wants to play it.

I like the programmed movement in this game.  It really feels like you are playing out a Western movie as you reveal the moves and punches and shootouts.  I brought it to my sister's house over a holiday weekend, and everyone wanted to play it again and again.  I would have preferred to move on to other games, but it made me happy to see them connect with it like they did.

Welche Karten aus meinem Kartensatz habe ich diese Runde zur Verfügung?
Was mache ich mit denen?
Planung? Mit sicherer Aussicht auf Erfolg planen kann nur der Startspieler seinen ersten Zug. Danach besteht die Planungsphase meist in Reaktionen. Handlungsabfolgen kann man sich vornehmen, ob das aber klappt, hängt davon ab, was sonst so passiert. Zwischendurch werden in der Planungsphase Karten verdeckt gespielt, da kann man nur zu ahnen versuchen. Manches, was man gerne gemacht hätte, kann man schon in der Planungsphase vergessen, weil man die dafür nötigen Karten in dieser Runde gar nicht hat. 
In der Aktionsphase läuft dann nur noch ab, was in der Planungsphase angedacht war. Da gibt es überraschende Entwicklungen und man findet sich an einem Ort, an dem man gar nicht sein wollte, so dass man eine Aktion nicht oder anders zu spielen hat, als es mal geplant war.
Ein eher lustiges Chaos mit einem Ende, das sehr stark vom Zufall beeinflusst ist.

In meinem Solospiel zum Kennenlernen hat durch seinen letzten Zug, der doch tatsächlich ausführbar war, der Spieler gewonnen, der zwischendrin im Mittelfeld lag, im konkreten Zeitpunkt aber letzter war.

Ein Spiel für Zocker, absolut nichts für Optimierer.

RATING: 6
The 3D train is nicely done, the theme of robbing it and shooting your opponents is attractive.  Programming moves from a partial set of your cards is nowhere near as enervating as in Robo Rally.  The wound cards do their job of clogging your deck and limiting your options.  And yet this felt a shade too light and chaotic for my taste.  

Production quality is good, although some care is needed in assembling the trains.  The artwork, including rocks and cactuses that are purely decorative, is nicely done.

Another good 'casual' or entry level game, but fun for anyone. Anyone can join in by just playing cards, but does reward a bit of thinking.

Good fun if you 'narrate' the fight scene as you play out the stack.

A toyish programmed action game wherein you move from train car to train car, or on top of the train, in order to pick up loot.  You can also punch, shoot, or move a sheriff, to disrupt other player's plans. There is a modicum of deck building in the game such that when you are shot, your deck gets filled with worthless bullet cards. 

Like a more involved, three dimensional "Walk the Plank" (which seemed slightly more fun for me if I recall), this is a worthy design for what it seeks to accomplish: toyish fun with programmed actions in an amusing setting.

I can readily see how this game would appeal to children, perhaps boys of a certain age in particular, but for my present adult tastes, this is just not a game that I want to be play again, so must give it a 6 at best.

Lots of neat little mechanics here, like when you shoot another Bandit you give them a Bullet card they have to shuffle into their Action deck, which can end up with them having less Actions on their turn. The game is just zany fun, and I'm sad I resisted it for as long as I did.

RATING: 6.5
A lot of laughs for your buck. Of course there's little match between the real world and what goes on here in cardboard land - but that doesn't matter much because this is not an attempt to wargame a Wild West era train robbery. For instance, you can't shoot people in the same carriage as you, you have to walk up to them and punch them. You can however shoot people in the next carriage even though you couldn't see them. You keep getting shot but never die. You can be punched and shot while running on the roof of the moving train but never fall off. This is cartoon Wild West and not meant to be taken seriously. For the same reason it is probably pointless to complain that there's a fair dose of luck (in my last game I played Cheyenne, whose special ability is punching, but I only drew my punch card once). When played as a lighthearted hour of fun, it works just fine.
Update: I wouldn't use the character special abilities, they are wildly unbalanced.

Colt Express has very cool theme and components, and it is also a very fun game!

The basic mechanic is a card-based programming à la Robo Rally, but with the actions chosen one after the other (and not at the same time) and open (but some actions, taken in tunnels, are played face down).
As soon as players complete programming, the actions are performed, and there is some thrill and much fun!

This game is quite easy to grasp, and I guess it can be enjoyed even by non gamers. Even more if you play it while listening to some Ennio Morricone's soundtrack!

Initial Impression: I LOVE the theme of this game. The components just ooze it. The game presents a wonderful story arc that screams Western. As far as gameplay goes, the game is a simple action programming game with fairly short turns and simple decisions. The game itself doesn't take long to play and certainly doesn't overstay its welcome. For players who are looking for a light, thematic game and are not too hung up on "winning", this game will fit the requirements. I'm looking forward to further plays of this game in order to experience the many story arcs.

Ameritrashy theme and components with a half-Euro, half-Ameritrash mechanical system.

The separation of the playing of and resolving of cards seems unnecessary and a wasted opportunity to make it matter more. Perhaps a first-in, last-out type system (a la M:TG) could have been developed into a more interesting game.

There is so much 'take-that' that the only winning strategy seems to be to use all of your bullets and gain the Gunslinger bonus, while hoping that you can end the game with one or two pieces of loot.

Fun and surprisingly light programmable movement game, a bit too short and I'm not at all sure about replayability, but expansions probably help that. I thought this was a real 3D movement game, but actually you are still just in two dimensions: either along the train or up-down, so still looking for that actual big and good 3D game.

This game is quite light and easy to pick teach and play.  It has been a hit with everyone that I have introduced it to.  However, because of its weight, I get bored with it quickly.  It is a game that I actively want to play every now and then.  It is also a game that my light-gamer/non gamer friends want to play all the time.  

It is one of the best looking light games I own, which certainly adds to the fun.  I really can recommend this game to just about anyone that has occasion to play light games with family or friends on occasion.

After repeated plays, I have found Colt Express rather disappointing. I appreciate a chaotic, programmed movement game as much as the next guy. The problem I find is that the interaction seems harder to come by than I ever expected. After the first few cards it's tough to keep track of where everyone is located so punching and shooting becomes a random guessing game. Even when played with different groups of people, including those who think out their moves extensively it hasn't work for me. Also all the money tends to get snatched up early, so it becomes a strange chase around the train looking to punch people. My expectations are always elevated with Spiel des Jahres winners and this one didn't live up.

A somewhat lighthearted programmed movement game of travelling along a train and grabbing loot. Fun moments arise when you punch someone off their spot and their turn changes because of it. The winner is often the one who can avoid conflict the most and grab the loot dropped by those who've been punched, but regardless, this game is quick enough (45 min) that the fun of trying to best lay out plans and roll with the punches makes this game very fun.

A passable, reasonably chaotic filler (though running slightly long for what it is, at about 45 mins with 5 players). Distinguished largely for the 3d train about which you move your cowboy meeples - tricky if, like me, you have fat fingers. Incorporates an element of programmed movement, a little like Roborally, with the same element of getting your enjoyment from seeing somebody's plans go up in smoke when something moves their piece to somewhere they weren't expecting to be.

A family game that appeals to the most committed gamers as well, Colt Express has everything a game needs to become a Spiel des Jahres but a German edition: it’s light and simple to grasp, makes the best out of well-known mechanics and even has a satisfying level of interaction among the players.

The way its theme has been developed grants it extra points.

This one is pretty random, but it is super light, so I found the chaos to be interesting and fun.  I can totally see why this got nominated for the SdJ, and I think this one is a keeper for the time being since this is one I can probably play with the family often.  Have not tried the "Expert" variant, where you have a discard pile, and I am not entirely sure I want to, as like I said, I found the chaos in this one fun.

A fun little programmable card game.  The toy factor is quite high with the cardboard train.  The actual gameplay itself is nothing to write home about it.  I dig the western theme, but this is not something I'd like to play with gamers.  Instead it's a family, non gamer design.  Simple to pick up and play, with lots of silliness.  If your memory sucks, stay far away.

It has interesting "simultaneous" turn order system, where actions are planned and then seeing them in action is like watching a movie. Still, game chararacter skills are unbalanced, card drawing adds randomness and can block you from doing anything significant. There are also too many turns for number of actions that are meaningful. More fun than strategy - probably best with younger players interested in main "wild west" theme.

Good dumb fun.  If you want something light that encourages silliness and and some seriously bad voice acting, then this is for you.  I think it scratches the same itch that Camel Up does.  It has saguaro cactus and bovine skull terrain stand-ups!  'Nuff said...

Juego de asaltar un tren. Cada jugador lleva a un bandolero y su objetivo es robar la mayor cantidad de dinero del tren antes de que llegue a la estación. Se juega en cinco turno. En cada turno, una carta indica cuantas rondas se juegan. En cada ronda, un jugador puede jugar una carta de acción, o robar tres cartas de su mazo. Una vez que todos han jugado sus rondas, se resuelve el turno y van sucediendose las acciones en el orden que se jugaron las cartas. Es caótico totalmente y ahí precisamente reside su gracia. Algunas veces las cartas se juegan bocaabajo. Para más coña, al final de cada ronda hay un evento. Es un juego divertido y apto para todo el mundo. Bastante rápido.

I love playing this at Aether Game Cafe, it's such a quick and hilarious game. The train is so cute! And fantastic little scenery as well!

The "tunnel" parts of the round are so funny because people do such unexpected moves! It is also hard to keep track of what everyone does in a 5 player game so the resolving is hilarious chaos!

When I do get this game, I think I will add the custom Meeple Source characters as well, since they'll make the game look even better!

Lots of fun with this game. I wonder how much replability this game will have.  There's only so many train cars, treasures, and things you can do. I'll definitely play if requested, enjoyed my play, but think it needs more to last longer than a year.  However. short length makes this a great last game of the night or shorter filler while another group finishes a longer game.

Did read the rules before buying the game and I my verdict was that there's not much control but it will not matter if the game is fun to play. After three games at the Spiel 2014 I can say that game is very fun thus the fact that there's limited control on what happens (especially if playing with more players) only creates interesting situations.

Very fun game that I originally gave an 8. It was a simple programming game. After adding both expansions and the Time Travel Car promo, the game became so much more complex (in a good way) and added many other options that i enjoy it to an even greater degree than before. The base game, still an 8. The game with expansions? Easy 10 in my book.

Ah, one of my most-loved games. Played this a fair amount by now, and while many of my group will play it but don't love it, I adore it.

It has everything. Player-vs-player interaction, misleading, mind games, backstabbing, and on top of all of that, it plays *very* quickly, which is always a huge plus for me. 5 rounds go by too quick to do many complex strategies, but it actually works out in favor of the depth, forcing you to adapt whatever you wanted to do to the very limited amount of turns available.

Also, it's still simple enough to play it with ~everyone.

A ton of fun! Really light and fast. Got the hang of it immediately. All the different ways to sabotage your opponents plans – filling their deck with bullets, punching them, unleashing the marshall on them – added so much to it. I honestly had more fun just trying to cause everyone on the board grief and barely paid attention to how I was scoring.

After several years, I have finally come to the realization that I hate programming games. The appeal of watching your piece do stupid things because someone's piece else messed up your plans is simply not there for me. It's funny once or twice, but it gets old fast. My husband hates this kind of game even more than I do, so goodbye Colt Express. Sold.

At low player counts the game is an unexciting exercise in memorization.  With 5 or 6 it is amusing, especially when punches fly and people end up in cars they were not expecting to be in.  Still, the game just does not grab me - I would rather play something else.

Bought the game as I was looking for a 6player game for my local tabletop group and it was half price markdown. Did not expect much from the game, I was wrong.

Game is an absolute blast. When playing with new players it always starts off slow on the first round, second round players figure things out and from the third round it becomes the real wild west. Lot's of laughs, shouting and punching. Turns even a nun into a train robbing villain (mmmm .... would love a nun train robber character).

From the coding mechanism to the 3D trains and terrain, this makes for a great experience. The only game I've got in my collection where everybody who has played it wants to play again, even non-players.

In the end, the game comes down mostly to what cards you pick up. Shooting is less fun than it should be. Too much take that for the kids.

Slightly odd game. It's been called a programming game, but it's not really, since the great majority of cards are played openly. It's really a memory/tactical game, and it's mostly about doing the best you can with a constrained set of options. Not quite sure what to make of it - it clearly wants to be a fun, light-ish action game, but then it can't offer you the appropriate set of decisions to evoke that feel. You spend most of your time doing look-ahead, recapping sequences of card plays, and then making fairly trivial tactical choices. The right answer, for the purpose of delivering on the game's apparent design intent, seems to be to offer you more decisions about risk and bluff. Instead there is this weird dynamic where it's primarily an extremely straightforward tactical look-ahead game, but one where occasional mistakes, misrememberings, or wrong analyses can have catastrophic consequences (rendering your entire turn ineffective). If the game were more sensible you would have to make a lot of guesses over the course of the game and things would go wrong with some frequency; instead, since it's mostly a tactical analysis game, you get rare missteps having huge downside consequences.

Anyway, this analysis is somewhat immaterial because really there is almost no game on offer here. Choices are mostly completely obvious, tactics are trivial, and there is very little (and often no) element of bluff or deception. I think it would be a totally entertaining game to play with mixed groups of younger kids and adults, or kids of various age ranges, but for purely adult gamers there is almost nothing on offer here beyond the generic appeal of playing a game (this is not nothing, certainly. But there are a lot of actual good games).

For the record, I think the "advanced" game (where you can retain cards from turn to turn) may actually be wrong. I've only played once so this is just a general principles/design aesthetic argument, but the additional control may actually not be desirable, given the game is what it is. The more that players can do something close to what they want, the more their actions become predictable and so the overall effect is to make the game kind of boring. When players start doing oddball stuff because their turns are heavily constrained, the game as a whole - when measured as an experience for everyone - becomes more interesting (even though it might suck to be an overly constrained player). Also, since it's mostly a game of triumphing over constraint, moderating the level of constraint removes the only real key design element and can deny the player a sense of accomplishment when the constraints are overcome.

OK, that was more words than this design really deserved. I don't think this is a particularly interesting design, certainly not artful in any way and of little interest to the hobbyist gamer.

The game it sort of reminds me of is Infiltration - the games have very surprisingly similar aesthetics and goals although Infiltration is obviously targeting a quite different demographic. But Infiltration is at least executed with some artistry.

A pretty neat pre=programmed movement game, where all players play cards onto a common pool, attempting to move around the train, attack the other players, and pick up sweet loot.  Then all of those cards are played out in the order they were played.

This would all be kind of boring if not for a bit of introduced randomness that keeps the proceedings from being entirely predictable!  Every once in a while, the train enters a tunnel, which means cards are played face down for one turn.  There are also a few other elements that keep things from being a sure thing.

Overall, good, light and kind of silly. The 3D train is also a cool gimmick that makes it more enjoyable than it probably should be!

OK but not great, seems to be lacking something to give it more definition.  I think the added chaos of more players helps and wouldn't play this with 3.  Most of the enjoyment in my plays have come from the novelty components of a 3D train.

After playing with the Hoses and Stagecoach expansion, I had a much better time.  The game has more options and is more nuanced.  Feels less bland and more vibrant.

I enjoy plotting out my actions and either having them go wrong due to unforeseen interactions with the other players or having them go right and feeling a sense of satisfaction.

However, the game's a little more complicated to explain than I would like and while it looks very pretty in play, I find the set-up fiddly to play with. It's hard to see at a glance what's going on, where things are, and difficult to access the meeples when they are inside the train cars. 

You can also find yourself going into the final round(s) knowing that you have zero chance of catching up to the leader(s).

I prefer playing digitally, as the game is less fiddly that way.

Very visually appealing type game with the 3D train. However, I felt the game was chaotic and I wasn't able to do what I wanted on a turn because of what I drew for cards. I wanted more control over my turn. It was still a fun to play because the theme was cool, and if it weren't for the great theme it would be rated lower. It's a game I dont feel I need to own but would not mind playing occasionally because it's light and quick.

It's a great looking game with OK game play. I was actually curious to try this out. One play left me a little cold, maybe because I got totally hammered and was essentially out of the game after three rounds, or maybe because I wasn't paying enough attention.

I'd give it a try again, but for programming movement, I'd rather play something with a bit more going on such as Lords of Xidit.

A crazy light romp of a game. I thoroughly enjoyed my play with 5 just because of how crazy it plays out after the programming is done. If you're not programming well then you could be stuck all alone and with little to do. The game really pushes you to get into the action and hope for the best, which for how quick this game plays and how it feels is just fine by me. My only concern now is will Flick 'em Up have the same beer & pretzels feel to it that I won't feel the need to own both. Well deserving of SdJ as I can see how this would bring families together for a game.

This is a quick programmed movement game where each bandit during a train robbery is trying to beat up the other players, hide from the marshal and grab as much loot as possible during the 5 rounds. What sets it over the top is the awesome 3D train components. Each round has players adding 3-5 action cards (move, punch, climb, steal, etc) in turn order to a stack, that are then revealed. Best laid plans are soon foiled as the player you thought you were punching is now a few cars away and instead the marshal is shooting at you as you scramble to the roof. It plays quick (30-40 mins) and if you embrace the chaos, it is a lot of fun.

It't not just the cool 3D board that creates 2 levels for play, this really is quite a cool game. We think it's a little bit of a competitive Space Alert light - much more accessible and easy for the kids to see the outcomes of their actions, and of course when the outcomes go a little awry. This is good fun.

Boring chaotic game. Sort-of like Roborally but on a much smaller 'board', and with the added advantage that Colt Express actually finishes in an agreeable amount of time. Fun to play with children. Not made for people with big hands (like me) and thus excessive form over function. The same game could have been easily played on a 2D-board without any of the ergonomical issues which plague the current 3D-version.

Charming introduction to the programming mechanic. The train is a real eye catcher, the game is simple enough for non-gamers to pick up. Characters don't feel very balanced (Cheyennes pickpocketing special is a serious and reliable advantage in action economy, Doc's additional card becomes weaker the further the game progresses... etc) so it helps to not play ultra-competitive. Advanced rules help mitigate the swingyness of the player-decks and are recommended for players who like more control and reliability in their planning.

Very wacky game reminiscent to the old Wild West films.  All the players are bandits running though and on top of the train trying to pick up loot and avoid the sheriff.  During the game you can shoot other players with gives then one of your bullet cards to clog up their deck.  You can punch someone, which makes them drop some loot and move into/onto the next train car.  It is very much like a comedy of errors during the game.  Highly entertaining.

RATING: 7.4
This most recent SdJ winner is enjoyable but not as fun as it could be. The components all look great and the idea is solid, it just stumbles a bit in the execution.

In CE you take the plan-ahead element from games like RoboRally and then wait to see where the players end up. Find yourself in the same car as another player and you'll have a chance to take a shot at them, or steal their dough. The biggest problem I noticed is that the special powers each player gets are very unbalanced. A few may never get used, while others are consistently handy.

I would play this again if asked, but I'm glad I got to try it first to confirm it's not one I need in my collection. And I think the SDJ folks got it wrong this time - both Machi Koro and The Game were more deserving.

Oh man is this fun game. Quick. Light. Goes nice with 6 players with virtually no downtime. Lots and lots of fun moments, laughs, broken alliances and what not. Definitely fun for everybody. I don't like that there is only 6 characters to choose from so after few 6 player games a game can go a bit repetitive but mission cards help to randomize that a little. Would not mind some more different characters to choose from.

While I can see why other people may like it, this is not my kind of game at all: Hidden trackable information (HTI) is at the very center of it and I strongly dislike all HTI (see my profile for my reasons).
Moreover, the different variable player powers of the bandits seem considerably too unbalanced to me. Particularly, Belle's and Cheyenne's are very strong and Django's is utterly weak (the powers of the other three seem to be somewhere in between).

I'm sorry for such low rating but I really haven't understood the purpose of this game... I could eventually rate a +1 for components and looking, but the game seems too much random to me, with no control on it. I think also the Ghost character is overpowered compared to others.

A crazy game of trying to rob a train, shoot your opponents and not encounter the Marshal.

Players pick their actions in sequence by placing cards in a central pile, then it's flipped over and the actions are gone through one at a time.

Have you remembered what others placed and played accordingly, or are you now trying to steal loot already gone or shoot somebody who is no longer in view?

Not sure I've ever won this game, but have thoroughly enjoyed every play.

Good basic programming game. The theme really helps new players get sucked in. It's a shame the cardboard components couldn't have been a smidge larger. The train looks cool on the table, but it would have been a whole lot better if it was just a bit bigger. The game is fairly luck dependent, but it's pretty short and silly enough that that doesn't matter in the slightest.

This game has really cool components.  It was a lot of fun putting together the model train.  This programming game is much like Robo Rally.  Your best laid plans can become a disaster when other players' moves play out.  The game play is ok, but the end-game isn't all that interesting and the game loses its engagement quite quickly.  I don't mind playing this, but usually there is something better to play instead.  I wonder if the expansions would make the game any better?

I love the idea of setting up and playing with a little locomotive as the player board. I've now had several plays of this in and I know this is a game that I could easily get to the table with almost any group just because of the aesthetics. Initial setup of this game is kind of a bear but at least you don't have to tear the train cars down in between plays and the storage is great. Only issue I really have with the entire game is if you have bigger hands it can be kind of cumbersome to maneuver among the train cars with your meeple. Highly recommended.

Light programming/combat game with fantastic bits and a wonderful three-dimensionality as you move through and above the carriages.  There is a lot of chaos, but in an enjoyable way; I much prefer chaos coming from the actions of other players than through dice rolls or card flips.

The player powers being so unbalanced is the biggest knock against.  This has way more theme and depth than the somewhat similar Walk the Plank, but that game definitely feels fairer.

Based on 1st plays. Looks really nice and the mechanics are allright. Feels more like a party game to me. With the right group and a decent "story telling", I can see that this would be a great game. With our group and/or with my son the game doesn't shine, so traded it away to make room for other games.

I like games a lot where theme and action blends perfectly well. And I like Robo Rally a lot. Although seefing the results of your programming of actions can be very frustrating. 
I didn't like my only play of Colt Express though. I felt played and very frustrated and even when I would have won, I would have had the impression that I didn't have accomplished a meaningful thing.
And though the train itself is quite nice being 3D and all that, I was very happy we reached the station where I could get out.

RATING: 9
It takes an experienced gamer only one play to know if they'll like Colt Express or not. I myself seem to love any game with a pre-programming mechanic, so I would have been shocked if I hadn't enjoyed this one immediately. But I've learned that games with pre-planned actions having the possibility of going awry isn't everyone's cup of tea.

To my mind, all the comparisons to Roborally are quite off-base because the programming in Colt Express has a unique twist in that the play of action cards happen sequentially as it's emerging, allowing you to somewhat react and adjust to the situation while it unfolds before your eyes and imagination...assuming you can correctly envision the movie-reel antics that are about to ensue, let alone even have the cards in hand to do anything about it. This makes the expert variant of this game somewhat of a necessity, if only to offset potentially brutal card draws comprised of nothing but bullets while your neighbors draw exactly what they need.

I feel this is a great family game, but also feel it's just a tad beyond the gateway level.

Update: Finally got to play it with my family and it bombed pretty hard. So sad. Oh well, I still love it, so need to be creative in finding ways to get it to a table somehow.

RATING: 6.8
Very nice and funny concept for a game, involving action planning and a 3D board (this case, a train).
The action planning associated with hand management (and some memory)is the great challenge of this game, also providing some funny (or frustating) moments, as some (most)of the actions you planned are often no longer possible, due to the actions of other players (from which you only can guess very few). However, it´s sometimes possible to do actions you never thought of...
The (automatic) mechanics of the game (refills, deals, etc)can be a little heavy, especially for a party game, but it´s still a fine experience, if you don´t have too high expectations for an hour of play.

Party programming game with a light hearted western theme of train robbing. Everyone programs several moves open handed but the twist is that a set of moves can potentially be hidden.

Goal is straightforward, just grab the most loot. Turn order is very powerful and important to planning. Being left alone by players and offensive sheriff control means victory. Random card draw can hurt despite draw mechanism.

Good quality components with the wild west meeples and 3D train board. Probably best for families or as a gateway game.

This game is a great casual game. Lots of fun, and easy to get to the table (2-6 players, easy to teach, not abstract, and short setup/play time). It's been a hit with everyone I've played with so far, and I can't get enough myself.
The sweet spot for strategic play seems to be 3 or 4 players, beyond that it tends to turn into a bit of a brawl (which is just as fun as long as you adjust expectations).
The expert mode variant (basically, keeping your hand between rounds and shuffling your draw deck only when it is empty, instead of cycling your hand and shuffling every round) I think could help bring a more strategic experience at all player levels, but I've only played it in 2 player thus far.

Love the Western train-robbery theme and the different stories that play out with each play.
Only minor complaint is I'm always wanting to have either 1 more round or 1 more action.  If that's the game-design to feel that way, then they did an excellent job in doing so, but it can be slightly frustrating to not do that 1 last thing that could have made you a winner.
I really like the "wounded" cards that limited your choices....brilliant design.

RATING: 6
Simple programming game, where players are train robbers looting a moving train.  A nicely implemented, chaotic family game where players take turns adding action cards to a deck, which is regularly flipped and resolved.  Actions include moving up and down the lovely 3-D train "game board", either along the carriages or roof, punching and shooting their opponents, and looting the carriages of cash/gem chips.  Most loot at the end of five rounds wins.  Chaotic, slightly fiddly with the tiny carriages, but good for what it is.

I've played the iPad version solo a couple of times. This is my first exposure to "programmed action" games, and based on the app I'm slightly curious/motivated to play it IRL. A lighthearted game that shouldn't be taken too seriously. More of a family game rather than one for hobbyists, seems to me.

A programming game, which is more like mini-action selection into a common pile.  The theme is strong, and that's good, since the chance of your plans working out is low.  The theme provides a lot of entertainment value, as does the presentation/components.  You have to go into this game knowing that your plans will be disrupted and roll with the flow.   Otherwise it will be too frustrating.   The train cars and loot tokens are both smaller than I expected.  Another game that I'm happy to play, but probably won't add to the collection.

Nagyon szórakoztató családi játék, ami 6 fővel a legélvezetesebb. Gyakorlatilag egy vicces fordulatokban gazdag vonatrablás történetét meséli el. A játékosok minden fordulóban megtervezik (hol nyíltan, hol titkosan) mit szeretnének végrehajtani az adott fordulóban, majd az akció fázis során megpróbálják megvalósítani a terveiket, amibe a többi játékos rendszeresen beleszól és ebből adódnak a vicces szituációk: levegőbe bokszolás és lövöldözés, marsall elől menekülés, stb. Az édesapámnak sikerült olyan helyzetbe kerülnie, amikor egy ékszer megszerzése helyett először el kellett menekülnie a marsall elől a tetőre, aki azért egy lövést még utána küldött, majd mivel a tetőn éppen Ő volt az egyetlen akire lehetett lőni, ezért gyorsan bekapott még egy lövést, majd visszavonult a vonatfülkébe búsan, mivel egy értékes kincs helyett sikerült neki két lövést is begyűjtenie :). A 3d-s vonat nagyon látványos, bár nagyobb ujjakkal kissé nehézkes lehet a bábuk mozgatása. Vicces helyzeteket kedvelő családoknak kifejezetten ajánlott. (2017.12.27.)

As a whole I am not a fan of programming games, I just find them frustrating and drawn out. This one though captures the amusement of having your plans ruined but maintains a lighthearted atmosphere and with the round limit it keeps it from just dragging. I'll keep an eye on the expansions, but I'm not chomping at the bit for them to come out just yet.

First play was quite fun.
But when "thematic charm" has ended, not much have left.
Game is chaotic and very random.
Doesn't scale very well and player abilities are not balanced. (Even in "fun giving" context.)

Of course for many people game is not for a challenge, just for emotions etc. 
For them this is good title.

This replaced RoboRally for us, and we haven't looked back. The knowledge that there are only so many rounds makes this a very attractive game to play at cons with new players. Having a definite end to a chaotic game like this is ideal.

 This is the second programmable-move game to come out of Essen, the other being the highly entertaining Lords of Xidit.  And Colt Express is also a great ride.   It isn’t quite as tense and exciting as Xidit but it has the benefit of playing in a third of the time and fitting a lot of laughs and entertainment along the way. 

The model train and the theme work really well: the characters riding atop of the train or in the carriage, fighting other characters, shooting them, stealing from them and so on.  Being a programmable move game there are plenty of times when a thrown fist  simply hits the fresh air, or when a shot is fired with no one to shoot at.  

All-round family and light gamery entertainment at its best.

I was walking by a game being setup and was invited to play.  After the cardboard train came out to the table, I was intrigued.

The premise is great and I like the idea of train robbery for a theme, and while there is nothing wrong or unlikeable about the game, I don't think it's an exceptional entry to the hobby.  For something so visually and thematically appealing, I was a bit disappointed to learn that the main mechanic of the game was programming.  While it proved to be interesting, especially with the face-down "tunnel" portions of the programming sequence to keep you guessing, I think if I want to play something like this, I'll go with Lords of Xidit or Space Alert.

Still, if action programming is your cuppa, there's nothing here that will disappoint you.  Couple that with, say, Trains' trash cards clogging your deck, and you've pretty much got the idea.

Cutthroat, Light

Has surpassed King of New York as my groups go-to light "take that!" game.  No dice rolling so each person feels somewhat more in control of what they are doing, plenty of direct conflict, it plays reasonably fast, no player elimination and it rewards good strategy.  It's very easy to teach (after one practice round, players will get it) and even beginners usually aren't blown out unless they get shot a bunch.  I think Ghost and Belle are overpowered but not egregiously so.  Being able to play that first card face down gives Ghost a huge edge, same goes for Belle not being able to be targeted if there are other valid targets.  Still, would bring this out every time we got new players or slow learners.  Considering the expansions but I don't want to over complicate this game, it's beauty is in it's simplicity.

2015-02-22 : First game went down well - many hilarious moments you can envision happening in a western movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. A good end-of-gamenight game. 2nd game with another bunch of new players and it was again well received. This is a game you can play with anyone and has lots of "oh, no" and "groan" moments. The fact it's totally overproduced heightens the enjoyment.

I had a lot of problems with this one.  It was way too chaotic.  The consequences of getting punched far outweighed the consequences of getting shot.  The player powers were pretty unbalanced.  The turns were highly tactical and based on far too few options.  Even things that seemed like nice touches, such as the cacti and 3D board, just served to annoy by the end.

Fun party type game (supports 6 very well) that is easy to get into.  Similar to Bang except it fixes the problem of eliminated players and is just overall more streamlined with the rules.  Its a little random/light on strategy for my taste (which makes me worry about the staying power of this game) but for what it is it does pretty well.  The train design/pieces definitely add a lot to the theme even if it is a bit tedious to move around in it.

Mostly a bluffing game.  You have to commit to some actions (move, shoot, grab VP) partially knowing the other players actions and partially blind.  Part of the game is pushing other players away from the treasure.  So, the real play aspect of this is mostly second guessing what someone else do so you can have a hidden action that will ruin their plan.  The cardboard train and moving the figures around is very thematic but a bit awkward for actual play.

I was a little quick judging this game. It is really fun when your programmed moves really pay off and also when your and other plans really do NOT pay off:)
It is a good family game with a lot of laughter and surprising outcomes.
However, there are three things that bother me with this game. The 3D cars are way too small, so it's almost impossible to pick the pieces and tokens out of them. It would have been better with just a 2D game board. I wonder if it had won SdJ if they had decided to go for 2D. I believe not, and that's a problem (maybe for the gaming industry). The other thing is that some players (that get a lot of bullets) may draw a hand that is really worth nothing. Of course, you can use one turn drawing 3 cards, but it feels like waste.
The third thing is that I don't think it works well with 2-3 players. The differences in score are often too much, and there are not so much action going on, despite the fact that you play with fewer cards.
Rating has gone significantly up since my first experience, so that's a good sign:)

Great all around game! Great theme, really fun play style.  You get a personal deck of cards that have actions on them. You draw a hand from your deck.  Then you take turns placing a card in a pile from the ones in your hand, sometimes face down.  When everyone has played their cards, some of them face down sometimes, you flip the whole pile over and play out the actions in turn.  Most of the time, you see what others have played, so you can strategize.  The fun happens when cards are placed face down, so you don't know what anyone else is doing.  This means that you might wind up shooting at someone on top of the train who climbed down into a car just a turn before, or punching air because someone vacated the car you were in.  Or one player moves into range of your gun, and your intended target moves out of it, and you wind up accidentally shooting the other guy instead.

I don't know, I'm torn on this game. The components are fantastic. The 3-D trains and cacti are amazing. Yet the gameplay felt a little less enjoyable then I would have hoped. Played it two players, and set up and rules run through was tough. There's only five rounds which didn't seem like enough. Grabbing (and holding onto) purses and gems was difficult as there aren't that many cards in your personal deck to do that. A house rule of a few more rounds might be needed. The only complaint I have with the components is that the train cars are not high enough. Placing and moving your characters around almost always results it knocking something over. Overall it was okay. I'm giving it an 8.5 based mostly on design. I know it will get more play time, so hopefully it will grow on me.

RATING: 7
Light-Hearted, quick programming game. While I've played with three and four players, I think the game would be best played with 5 or 6 due to how hectic the game would become. Component quality of the train and cards is great, but the player boards are made of a thin card-like material that peels easily. It would have been nice if these were made of cardboard, or at least a thicker, more protective material.

There's potential in the game for someone to be completely ruined by bad luck or decisions - adding bullet cards that clog up a player's hand with worthless cards. This mechanic is thematic, and the game balances this by allowing players to spend a turn to draw three additional cards. Additionally, games are short so if a player makes a series of bad decisions he or she can get back into the game after only 30 minutes.

RATING: 6.7
Jópofa partyjáték. Jó ötlet volt a programozás megoldása egyszerű egymásra kijátszott kártyákkal, valamint deck building party játékot se láttam még. A kivitelezés, mindenkit magával ragad. 
Viszont ilyen áron party játékot venni szerintem nem annyira reális. Valamint még a komolytalanságát figyelembe véve is fájdalmas kiegyensúlyozatlanok a karakterek. Az egyensúly hiánya nem is lenne baj, de hogy vannak olyan karakterek, akiknek gyakorlatilag teljesen használhatatlan a képessége az azért frusztráló.

RATING: 6
Colt Express is a silly little game. There is so much player-induced chaos, both deliberate and incidental, that It's hard to take seriously. The over-the-top 3D train "board" probably serves to reinforce that impression even more. Even though Colt Express often gets compared to RoboRally, there is quite a bit less programming and similarly reduced influence here. At the same time, it runs quite a bit shorter.

If you are looking for some strategic heist planning you better go look somewhere else. However, as a quick "in-your-face" romp where the ride is more important than the final result Colt Express certainly has its moments.

RATING: 7
COLT EXPRESS simuliert einen Raubüberfall auf eine Lokomotive im Wilden Westen und glänzt dabei von einer thematischen Unmittelbarkeit und Wunderbarkeit, die das Spiel zu einer wilden, anarchischen Ballerei und Balgerei macht. Das Spielprinzip ist so simpel wie ein Stetson: Karten mit Aktionen aus Rennen, Schiessen, Hüpfen, Schlagen, Klauen auf einen Stapel legen, offen und blind, und nacheinander runterspielen. Daraus ergibt sich ein rasantes, unkalkulierbares Chaos auf dem herzallerliebsten, dreidimensionalen Zug, in dessen Wagons sich Wurstfinger und Grobiane vergeblich mühen dürfen. COLT EXPRESS ist Rauchende Colts, ist mehr Spielzeug als Spiel, aber als solches von romantischer, jungenhafter Verzückung.

Lately, I have not been playing enough to tell whether this game is a worthy SdJ winner. However, I would guess so.

I do not take the game seriously. I do my stuff, sometimes they work, often they don't. I have only played the game a few times, and the winner never knew how they have won. (Including myself.) The characters are definitely not balanced and the more players you have, the less control you have on how the whole thing will go. (I have played this with 4 and 6.)

Nevertheless, I have no problem with this. I enjoy watching how the chaos unravels every turn. I am always pretty happy if I manage to sneak my idea through, but never really mind if I don't. Basically, I am always involved, but I'm only rarely frustrated - that's an awesome combo. I also do not know too many other games, where the players actually laugh when something gets messed up. In a friendly environment this is a definitely good choice for a short game.

Update: I bump this to an 8 (from 7). I have played it with a bunch of people new to boardgames and they loved it. The theme is awesome which makes it easy to get involved. The rules are super easy and they could grasp them immediately. And once again, we laughed throughout all the games. I would definitely get bored with Colt Express if I had to play it more often - it does not have any hidden depths or anything. (I only play it ~annually so I don't mind that.) However, it is more of a gateway game and is also an incredibly well-designed one.

Interesting game that has a nice board, sort of what I always wanted Bang to be but it wasn't. Core game play is probably a 6 but it gets a +1.5 for fun and +.5 for great art and 3d train. Core mechanic is building the action deck by each player playing 1 card in order sometimes face up sometimes face down then after deck is built flip it over and resolve each card so it helps to remember what your opponent played. It's a rolling ball of chaos :)

Shocked at how fun this was 2p controlling two bandits.  Thought it would be too chaotic or not interesting but it really was a blast to play!  The flexibility to change which direction or how many spaces you move when the card come up keeps you engaged throughout the resolution.

A little fiddly to move/get pieces inside the train(I have big hands) but that is nitpicky.  Putting together the train cars(I glued mine along the seems) will be a pain for many as well.

A SdJ winner I actually want to keep!  Lol

A cute game of programming your moves ahead of time and then getting shot to pieces as it all goes horribly wrong. Bonus points for supplying utterly pointless but cute cardboard scenery.

The most western game I have ever played. A lot of shooting and punching each other while trying to rob a train - the theme is great. Fantastic idea to add bullet wounds to player's deck. I really like the plan-execution mechanics as well. Especially when my carefully planned operation succeeds :) The skills of the characters could be better balanced though and the 5-6 player mode is not good. Not enough actions to do some reasonable plundering.

I've liked it.  It's unique, and doesn't feel like any other game in my collection.  I think the more poeple, the better in this one.  On the one hand, I wish it were more "zany" - I'm often punching or shooting when there's no one there, and while that's funny, sometimes it can feel like there isn't enough actual action in the game.  At least from our first two plays.

But we enjoyed it, and front to back done in 30 minutes, it works well for me and the folks I play with.

Decent fun if you have a big group or players who are casual gamers. The pre-programmed nature of the game makes for a lot of randomness. Turn order and the instances when cards are played face down makes for a lot of luck. Also, as other's have mentioned elsewhere, there are characters, especially Cheyenne and Belle (and to a lesser degree Doc), whose abilities are far superior to the other characters. 

In the end, to make this game fun, you need to be playing with people who are in for a bit of randomness, a bit of luck, and a whole lot of getting into character!

For a light and silly game, there is a lot happening here: outguessing your opponents, of course, but also some bluffing, some deduction, some light tactics, some longer-term planning, and a lot of making the best of a bad situation. It seems like it should be an awesome game, but for me at least, it was somehow less than the sum of its parts. I would definitely be willing to give it another try.

Light and quick programmed-movement game where you attempt to collect the largest amount of loot during a train robbery.  Visually appealing due to the 3D nature of the "game board".  The enjoyment in this game seems to stem from watching chaos unfold, as the programmed moves are executed, rather than actually having your plan work (which it most often won't). 

Family,friends, and I all enjoy it, and we're all looking forward to adding in the expansions.

Könnyen tanítható, látványos, kellemes partijáték, amelyet nem szabad komolyan venni. Üss-csenj-fuss-lőj, hogy te legyél legrafkósabb bandita a körben.

Was intruiged by this game. It's getting great feedback. Bought it and we like it enough. It's sort of an hybrid between a programing/deckbuilder/western game. Light and often very impredictable. Good family game with some random elements that will screw over your plans but if you can live with that, a great game.

Juego tematico sencillote. El escenario es un tren (maquetado con piezas troqueladas, queda bastante aparente) y cada jugador es un atracador. Gana el que consigue acumular mas botines. 

Las acciones se hacen acumuladamente (y en parte a ciegas), con lo cual el desarrollo es en cierto punto imprevisible. risas aseguradas. 

buen juego para sesion ligera. adecuado para niños y para no-gamers. 

Para no variar, yera expansionfest le ha agregado todas las expansiones (2 hasta la fecha) que han salido para el. un dia de estos las pondré en la lista.

I mean, it's plenty fun, but the rules : depth ratio is pretty ridiculous. The train is awesome (albeit less functional than is ideal), and the terrain is great. But the decision space just doesn't seem to warrant the investment.

RATING: 7
Does action programming just right. The key is the small playing space - each move can only change the game state a little bit, so it's fairly possible to keep track of what the board might look like by that point. When a card is played hidden there's only a few actions it could be so you have a fair idea what will happen, but still an exciting bit of mystery and reveal. The gunslinger bonus does dominate the scoring a little too much I think.

Light-hearted family game with action-programming. The 3D train brings it to life thematically, and is a hit with younger players. Being a western, there's a fairly strong 'take-that' element, but it's quite tongue-in-cheek.

RATING: 8
After a few plays I love this game.  I am sure there are flaws I am overlooking in favor of the killer components (3D cardboard train!!!) so forgive me.

The game exudes theme and is full of exciting gameplay.  There is enough variants in the rulebook to play this game with any audience.  I have played with groups of kids under 8 and with groups mixed kids and adults.  It is very simple to drop or add the more advanced rules.

On top of having flexibility in specific rules; there is also a well thought out 2-player rule variant.

My only complaint with the rulebook is the lack of clarity on setting up the train (it really lays it out like it is supposed to be in a specific order when it does not) and secondly there is not clear guidance that once the action deck is built that it should be hidden and revealed one at a time (i.e. players can't look into the deck to see what is coming next... they need to be forced to remember what was played).

Other than those two clarifications in the rules I plan to play this on a regular basis.  Shooting and moving and the excitement of seeing what players played in secret during the tunnel rounds makes for a great session!

Pretty damn fun to me.  I really enjoyed programmed movement games.  I loved moving meeples around the 3d train.  I also liked the chunky vps in treasure- it seems to fit thematically.  I worry that it might not have enough legs for replayability.  But as a 5-6 player game it may be fun enough to last in the rotation anyway.

Program your bandit's moves, hoping others won't do something that disrupts your planning... except they often will. Lady luck has a good stand in your gameplay experience, and players interact all through the game. That's what I like about it - it's good, not too deep fun, with a possibility for people who like deeper games to think they can anticipate everything else and outsmart everyone - and fail. Works with a group of varied friends.

It does feel chaotic with max number of players. Further plays have thus a bit decreased my like for the game.

(01/02/2015) Comment based on 1 play.

This is a humorous, but well executed take on Robo Rally, constrained to a one-dimensional line (forwards and aftwards), stacked (constrained to two levels), with some combat and treasure collection, driven by a deck-building (clogging?) mechanism.

First off, the physical components are well made, especially the cardboard 3D representation of the steam locomotive and passenger cars. It actually feels like a moderate miniatures game, with very crude movement and combat.

Starting with a deck of ten action cards, each player draws six randomly to form their hand. In turn order, they "program" their actions in a first-in/first-out queue. The actions are the expected fore/aft movement, climb up/climb down, fire gun, punch, pick up treasure (money, which is VP), or move the marshal. There are five "acts", with each act dictating four or five actions per player, along with some interesting plot twist at the end. Further, one of the four/five action slots is a "tunnel", which allows players to program an action face-down; normally, actions are programmed face-up, so others can react accordingly.

Programming face-up actions can be predictable and boring, but the one hidden action can throw unpredictability into the mix, making a mess of all the players' plans--the result is a hysterical narrative of plans going terribly wrong. It is within this chaotic framework that players are trying to collect as much treasure (with hidden values) scattered throughout the train. Also, each player role has a special power that can add more unpredictability!

The novel feature is as players shoot each other, they give the victim a useless "bullet" card that is shuffled into the victim's deck! As the victim takes more hits, the more their deck gets clogged, like Curses in Dominion. The wandering marshal also hands out bullets to clog up decks. The player that successfully shoots the most bullets wins a game-end bonus. After five acts, whomever has the most money wins the game.

All in all, this is a light-hearted, fast-paced game, full of hilarious outcomes, but surprisingly meaty in terms of tactics. It is an excellent 30-minute romp, very thematic (if you like spaghetti Westerns), and a very engaging good time. Lastly, it is very accessible to both gamers and non-gamers alike, as well as adults and younger children. It is a solid "7", with possible bump up to an "8" with more plays.

(01/03/2015) 2 plays. First 6-player game was rather chaotic, with so many players crawling all over the train. Still, a fun romp, holding at a steady "7". It looks rather trivial in terms of mechanics, but it provides a good mix of randomness, mitigated by skillful foresight and planning.

Colt Express is one of those games where you can have a great time even if you're not doing very well, score-wise. Trying to guess what other players are choosing to do can be a great challenge and I particularly enjoy trying to come up with flexible strategies which can change my turn on-the-fly. Plus, 3D cardboard train!

It's a very different experience with 3 players than with 6. Smaller player numbers make it easier to keep track of card placement and possible intentions, 6 players makes it almost impossible to keep in mind everybody's movements and leads to much more defensive play.

This played out to me like a more fun, but less strategic version of Robo Rally.

Bokkensprong, 18/09/'15. Buit roven in 3D-trein met wagonnetjes, marshall ontwijken en andere bandieten dwarsbomen. Per ronde legt elke speler x actiekaarten, die daarna in de gelegde volgorde een voor een worden uitgespeeld (beetje systeem van River Dragons). Acties zijn: een wagon vooruit of achteruit gaan, op het dak klimmen of ervan terug in de wagon dalen, schieten, een dreun uitdelen, buit oprapen, of de marshall verplaatsen.

I had high hopes for this game following all of the accolades it received.  Unfortunately, Colt Express fell flat for my game group.  Admittedly, I prefer deep strategy games - but this game was not enjoyable (for me) even as a light filler game.  The programming mechanism is intriguing, but in practice the game is far too random for my tastes.  Players can have entire rounds (there are 5 rounds) where they accomplish nothing and those players that do make progress do so almost entirely because of chance, which, in my opinion, removes the fun.  The randomness and luck make this feel more like a young children's game, but I wouldn't feel comfortable introducing this to young children due to the robbery and gun violence themes.  I can see the how this game will be enjoyable for some, but it is not for me.  The artwork and component quality, however, are top notch.

Colt Express wastes a great theme and components on a game filled with decisions that can be rendered meaningless through plays made randomly by other players. The game hides entirely too much information (the tunnels instantly turn rounds into guessing games) and doesn't even always allow an attempt at an optimal move thanks to only having some of a player's actions available at any given time.

Some might enjoy the chaos of playing this game; I find the restrictions it imposes overly limiting and, not merely devoid of fun, but annoying.

You can't take it too seriously but it is an absolute blast.  After two plays, I am excited to play it again.  I will adjust my scoring and review of the game as I get more plays of it later.

EDIT:
Great fun for non-gamers.  You can't have people who are too competitive though or they won't have much fun.

Not much of a game as there's not much to think about and it's chaotic. Probably best with 5-6 since there is a little more going on. We played a 3 player and the loot ran out on the floor so we were just running around trying to punch or shoot each other.

OK beer 'n pretzels "take that" with pre-programmed movement. Some of which is public, some isn't. It's best with the right crowd. I guess kids would enjoy it a lot since they can stick it to the adults. Nice components/artwork. A little excessive with cactii, terrain, etc. that serves as a backdrop and nothing else. Low price point. May have appeal for Bang the Dice game fans, another game with nothing to do but for some reason is very popular.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2015)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, that is, I had lots of fun playing it. I still think the game needs a good group to be properly enjoyed but I’m open to play it again in the near future.

The game components are awesome and they really add to the thematic setting. The theme is ok I guess, it is a bit boring for me, but it shines through the game.

The game´s rules are very easy to teach and the playtime is around 45 minutes.

There is a fair share of luck in Colt Express, but in this case I don’t mind as much as the game plays so quickly, for the same reason I don’t mind the “attack the perceived leader” factor present in it. Each player has a different role and each role has a power. Many of these powers seem unbalanced and situational but again, I don´t mind because the game is light and quick. You can always balance it with the players´ actions.

I think you need at least 4 players to enjoy the game. 

Bottom line, I think Colt Express is a great family game, it offers lots of fun in a short timeframe. I would play again if requested but I already sold my copy of the game.

RATING: 1
Colt Express works by preprogramming your moves using cards drawn from a deck of basic actions, such as shoot, walk and so on. Your moves are programmed with random draws and if you're shot, do nothing cards are shoved in to your deck. You have little control over your own actions, and even less so of other players. Regardless of how it's packaged, this game is just a group of people picking cards at random and then seeing what happens. I didn't think i'd ever think a game could have too much interaction, but Colt Express certainly proved me wrong. This game is an absolute mess. It has a cardboard train though, so it flies off the shelf.

Played a few games now and I have enjoyed them but now I'm getting to know the game a little bit I feel the rounds are just a little to short. If you find yourself out of position on the last round you might have no options available to you at all. The fun of the game is definitely predicting the other players moves and messing them up but the game can depend a lot on luck as the rounds are so short that if you don't have the cards you need you have to waist a turn picking cards up and then you don't have enough turns left to do anything. 
The game has a lot of good points too, we enjoy the two phases to the game and resolving the actions in real time and we love the hidden rounds and special abilities. The game plays better with more players, I would say most fun with max player count. 
The next time we play I think we will add an extra round or two on the end with one of them a hidden round and see if it plays better. Jury's still out on this one.

Meeples move up and down the 3D train based on cards you set down per round — with the randomness of the cards increasing as you get hit more, and your placements affected by the planned moves of the others. It's fairly simple and light on strategy, but the game is not meant to go long -- and, most importantly, the 3D aspect really helps to visualize what's going to happen which is something other games (like RoboRally) miss out on.

PLUS: theme, 3D visualization
MINUS: not a game that encourages deep thoughts

RATING: 7
Fun, family-friendly programmed action game. Does not have the length and complication of RoboRally. This is a much simpler game, for better and for worse. I enjoy this with my kids for the simple pleasures it offers, but there isn't quite enough variety here for an adult audience. 

I think the main reason I enjoy RoboRally more is because of the more challenging consequences to deal with when you are shot. In Colt Express, it borrows from deck-building games and adds useless cards to your draw deck. It is FAR more interesting figuring out how to negotiate locked programs when you are damaged in RoboRally.

Un juego de programación de acciones.

Cada ronda los jugadores ponen cartas (boca arriba o boca abajo) sobre un un mazo común. Una vez que todos los jugadores han jugado sus cartas, el mazo común entra en juego. Cada acción que se muestra en las cartas se resuelve.

Visualmente, el juego es muy bonito pero tras jugar me quedé un poco decepcionado. Podría ser divertido, pero necesito más partidas para confirmarlo.

A game about action programming.

Each round players put cards (faced up or down) on a common deck. Once every player has played his cards, the common deck enters in play. Every action shown on the cards is solved.

Visually, this game looks amazing but I was a little disappointed after playing it. It could be fun but I need more plays to confirm it.[/color]

Love it. So much fun to play, and evocative of the confusion of a train robbery full of untrustworthy characters. Getting a read on what people are planning to do and adjusting your tactics to react to them is intriguing - and especially surprising when someone takes a totally unexpected action in a tunnel.

Shares a frustrating aspect with other programmed movement games in that getting forced off your planned route can lead to turns where you effectively do nothing. But on the other hand, having a turn that goes totally cockeyed - but through some stroke of luck, still has you end up doing something productive - is hilariously entertaining.

A variation on the programming mechanism from Robo Rally in a family-accessible form. All players jointly plan an action sequence with limited knowledge on the programs of the other players.

This is a story building with cards type game.  Each round consists of players in turn order, which may change with some icons, playing cards that tell a brief story.

Really different and fresh feeling game with an unusually ambitious concentration on presentation. The train makes the whole game, and I love how there is a bunch of extraneous decorations (cactus, bones) to set on the table, with no effect on game play whatsoever.

The mechanisms are nothing new but they create excitement and wacky situations. If players are willing to play in a careless go-with-the-flow spirit, this should always go down well. If players are trying to memorize, calculate and optimize, it would suck the fun out. But as a quick, chaotic romp, this is wonderful.

I really enjoy this game a lot. The mechanics are fun, the theme is great, and it's an awesome gateway game for my non-gaming friends.

Programming game with the gimmick of the 3D train. Can be a little frustrating since it seems like you can somestimes determine that you are going to lose (a long time before the game is over) with not much to do about it. I would play it again but probably prefer other programming games instead.

RATING: 5
A programmed action game like a much smaller, much quicker, presumably more accessible Roborally. But the cramped play area also means that chaos is proportionally higher, the characters don't seem balanced at all, and the scoring system is just kinda off, both thematically and mechanically. There's also a palpable death spiral to the gunslinger element since getting shot slows your own rate of fire; therefore, if your power makes you much less likely to be hit... Definitely overproduced: the train could easily have been rendered flat in an isometric fashion and the stationary props only detract from the illusion of a moving train. Suspect I would still often choose this over Roborally.

Colt Express, famous for the 3D train papercraft model included in the game, is a programmable movement bandito game. Choose one of the roles and get to the looting!

I had fun with it and wanted to rate it a 7 but...
some players just don't get programmable movement. And one player like this can really impact a game. Beyond that it also become too chaotic to my liking at high player counts. In fact, some roles are also kinda "eeeh...". Like Django, who just interrupts plans. Or the red dude who feels very dull when compared to the others.

Programmed movement game on a train where bandits with asymmetrical powers are all fighting one another for bags of loot over several turns.  Everyone is also trying to avoid the Marshal, who is wandering through the train looking for the bandits.  The novelty of this game is that it is played in/on a 3D cardboard train.

Fun party game that is PVP. Who wouldn't love being a train robber stealing from the ones helping you rob the train in the first place lol! It's fast paced but not much in theme as far as you are trying to end up with the most treasure at the end but the 3D design is unique from most games and is a great laugh for everyone. Very family friendly!

Everyone are bandits robbing a train. Whoever escapes with the most money wins. The game is fun, comes with cool components (you build your own train out of cool cardboard), but has a little balancing issue (one of the player abilities is quite a bit better than others).

This is quite a fun and entertaining game of programmed movement.  It's fairly random and involves a bit of guessing as can be expected when you have to plot out several moves in advance.  But that's what helps to make this a fun game for a fun group experience.

A fun take on the programming genre - nice to have a little freedom in how to process your moves rather than watching them crash and burn entirely. That you can make decisions based on what's coming up later in the round also gives an enjoyably strange sense of slight precognition, which actually doesn't feel out of place in the Western genre. And playing cards face-down during a "tunnel" is a great piece of theme.

An amazingly thematic game that manages to save programmed action selection for me as a mechanic (take that, Robo Rally!).

You can't help but be sucked into the movie running in your head as you all race around the train shooting folks, and punching them so you can take their loot.

Have to try it. Then should probably buy it. Amazing art.

RATING: N/A
In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:

Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.
Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!
The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.

Fun party game with a very spectacular “board” – a 3D train made of cardboard. Some simple programming by playing cards one after each other, a trip randomized by cards, shooting, punching each other, grabbing money bags, jumping from car to car on the top of the train, sending the sheriff to your opponents (hopefully) and so on. This is the kind of game where everyone tries to collect as much money as they can during play, but in the end no one cares what the results were – we played just for fun.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was a charming and enjoyable romp.  Involves a bit of programming your actions, some of which you can see and some you cannot when programming is occurring.  As well, since you do not have your whole hand available, instead of programming a card you can draw three cards to enhance your options for the next programming opportunity.  Bullet cards are a pain as they will clog your deck and these can be received from other players who shoot you or from the deputy who is also happy to shoot you.  The characters also have special powers which are interesting but after first play, Belle feels a bit overpowered.

Its rare that the first time I play a game I come away thinking that it was just flat out fun, Colt Express is one of those games. Programming games can be hit or miss with me, mostly on the miss side. Colt Express brings not only a compelling setting, but also very compelling artwork and components. The 3D train components are not only functional, but also pleasing to look at when set up on the table. The cardboard for the trains is extremely sturdy and should be able to withstand a good amount of punishment. The individual player powers are all very different and change the game up. All this and you add an extremely easy to understand rule set and you definitely have yourself a winner.

Si giocano carte azione in maniera sequenziale, ma solo alla fine del turno si possono ricapitolare per vedere cosa è successo.
Alcune sono giocate visibili quindi facili da ricordare, altre coperte per via di abilità o gallerie.

I love RoboRally. When I play Galaxy Trucker, I never look at the event cards beforehand. Games in which you're hoping for everything to go horribly wrong are like music to me. So I liked what I heard about Colt Express and traded for a copy.

During our game I could see that the other three players were going to converge in a car next to the Marshall. I sneakily (it was a tunnel) played a "move the Marshall" card, excited to fill all three of them full of lead. However, all of them followed with Shoot cards. So when it came time for me to move the Marshall, if I'd kept to my plan, they'd all be on the roof firing at the only possible target: me. That's the kind of moment I love. 

There's some strategy here, and the winner certainly won through smart and well-timed card play, but mostly it's a lot of dumb surprising fun. I'm glad to have a copy of this.

Excellent game with very fun dynamics/mechanics.  Good for laughs especially if someone's well laid plans for a round are foiled by other players, and especially so when it happens multiple times in sequence.  Characters seem to consist of two good shooters, two good melee fighters, and two who are more nimble and well rounded.  

Plenty of strategies for winning, be careful not to let someone else's tactics sneak up on you.  One high value grab and it's over.  Game is fairly competitive, but the range of end results is wide (you can gain a lot or lose a lot in one turn, or stay fairly steady throughout).  Go with the flow and pay attention to how everyone's playing and make sure to use your own character's strengths to gain advantage.

Con: small train carriages makes for some difficulty moving pieces around.  Could be just 20% bigger to allow fingers to slide more easily into the carriages.  Ghost (white) seems slightly overpowered as I understand the mechanics currently, though I have only played two games, first as Doc (blue), then as Ghost.

Edit: All the comments from people who rated this game 4 or below either didn't follow the rules correctly or simply cannot plan, or guess, how other people are going to be playing cards.  Even if your "Schemin'" doesn't go 100% as planned you have to laugh, shrug, and get ready for the next round.  I get that it's frustrating to lose if you're a competitive person (I am too), but I hope they can grow out of it.  Try a different strategy and don't forget to use your character's inherent abilities while also watching out for other people doing the same (they will).

We played this two players and while the game definitely doesn't shine with only two we could see it's potential.  The fact that you remove all double cards for two players meant we hardly moved anywhere and getting the briefcase was never going to happen.  We've decided to play again as four players (each controlling two full characters) and see if that retains some of the fun chaos we expect it to have as a multi-player.

All of the chaotic fun of RoboRally without getting totally screwed over, with variable player powers, some more strategic planning (despite being a rather light game), and with a much more attractive "board".

The ability to sometimes see what your opponents are going to do allows you to better plan what you should do on your turn. On the other hand other people can still throw a monkey wrench via choosing who to shoot/punch, moving in the direction you didn't expect them to, etc, notwithstanding the tunnel turns where you place cards face down. Like RoboRally hand management is still important in this game as e.g. you only have one punch card.

I'm not completely sure how balanced all of the powers are, but they all seem fairly useful.

I definitely think this game works better in the higher player counts, as it gives more train space to move around. The more players there are the harder it is to keep track what everyone is going to do, but it also means you have a better chance of e.g. shooting someone just by sheer numbers.

One thing that might turn people off is since you can choose who you can shoot if there are multiple people in range, there is some take that aspect to the game. However, like I said above unlike Roborally getting shot even multiple times isn't the end of the world, and while it is possible to lose because e.g. someone chooses to punch you instead of someone else, it would be hard for someone to be in range to punch you repeatedly unless A. everyone just gangs up on you for no apparent reason or B. you are playing terribly.

Bought at Essen 2014. This doesn't fire Cash n Guns, but it does come close. It is more complicated so I cannot play this with everyone, but a massive pro is that the 3 player game is really good and much less random. It really scales well from 3-6. 2 player is awful though and more importantly, not fun at all. The advanced card draw rules are quite devoid of fun also. But it is an excellent game and one of our top Essen 2014 games. A lot of fun when played with the normal rules and at least 3 players.

Colt Express is nearly pure chaos with the basic game. That's a LARGE nearly, as repeated plays have seen significant decision points arise, but honestly, one errant card will derail you. The thing is, it happens to everyone fairly equally, so much like a bar room brawl you're just trying to get hit less than anyone else.

The game is fast, furious, and fascinating to watch unfold. It is full of flavor, and is just plain fun.

Programmable movement and action game with some special powers. Played with 2 which means you play 2 bandits each and makes it hard to remember what has happened to both of the characters. Other peoples actions can mess you up but not so much with 2 maybe would be more chaotic with more players. Still fun though.

Only played once - 6 people. Had a pretty fun time. The programming movement turned to be pretty funny since you can't remember what people chose and then they do something else anyway...

Definitely a light, fun, casual game to play with friends over some drinks. 

Like how there are different characters you can be with special abilities.

I love the components in this game, and the theme is really cool. After my initial few plays, it's hard to tell what the strategy is; it feels like my plans are too easily spoiled by other players, and the game is somewhat chaotic. That's all part of the fun of course, but it does mean I'm less likely to choose this when I'm feeling competitive.

Colt Express is a nice family game with a bit of programing and strategy and beautiful components. Feels a bit flat compared to Roborally, but still a decent play.

Interesting. A little too "screw the other player over" for my liking but it was somewhat fun. Don't see why the 3D aspect of it was necessary. A normal board would have been more manageable and would have made it less easy to miss where loot tokens are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is a really fun "programming", out-guessing opponents game.  It's light and funny and chaotic.  I don't know what to think about the 3D "board".  It's super cool to look at, but my stubby fingers sure had a hard time placing and pulling out those tiny money and gem chits.  And the little scenery stands - again, cute, but functionally unnecessary.  I kept knocking them over so I just swept them aside to focus on the game.

I'd like to say that I'd just prefer a standard board - but I get that the publisher was looking for some "hook".  I think they succeeded in that, as it is indeed novel and attractive - just at the cost of being a bit fiddly and at times a tad annoying.

Having said that, I'd love to play again!  Game play is definitely fun.

RATING: 6
This game is a lot like RoboRally but different in the following ways:
1 - Less space so you are bound to get in each other's way
2 - The game has a predetermined end (5 rounds, big plus)
3 - It is more focused on attacking then reaching a particular space on the board
4 - There is a marshall that affects everyone negatively

Cool components, although I suggest designating one person to move the pieces since it can get a bit crowded.

This game is silly, it is meant to be so and the enjoyment will be based on the group's attitude as much as anything.

playtime ~ 10 minutes per player

Clever idea with the two-level train and programmed movement.  But with the tunnel round and Ghost character, there is a large measure of luck, along with some 'take-that' thrown in.  And the bits are fiddly; it's difficult to get the bandits and loot tokens off the lower level.

A fun programming game where the greatest strength is the theme which makes it great fun to get out and play with the novel trains. Very luck based and chaotic as you are never sure what others have done to ruin your (well thought out?) plan.

It lacks a deeper element of strategy which I enjoy in games and some of the abilities are significantly more powerful than others.

The game is fine... I'm just really bad at it... so it's not fun for me.

I got this on some sort of crazy clearance at Toys 'R' Us for about $4.

Box insert: 7/10, they tried really hard, and that is saying something for the sheer size of the components. A compartment for each train is great, but there is no room for anything else, and the dividers should have been made of a more sturdy material. This may have been so they could store the parts before you built them, and I'm not saying they should have taken away the ability to build the train either.

RATING: 7
First programmatic game I ever played. Beautiful 'board' and components, great art and theme.
Impressions from playing 2 games:
- I like the programming and trying to deduce where I'll be. Or realizing I could be in one of two places, and trying to find an action that will work either way. Adaptation is key (especially since cards you draw may not let you continue the plans from the previous round). Theme was also fun.
- On negative side, Ghost character seems to clearly be the most powerful (came in 1st and 2nd, despite shuffling player-character pairs). This comes from the fact that hiding the first card they play can mess up several other players every round, while they can still compute everything (or everything minus tunnel; but either way it's a major informational and planning gain).
- Game lends itself to someone getting beat up on... at least happened in both games we played (e.g. getting shot 4 times in a row, 7 times in a round, despite being Belle). So not sure I would recommend this for kids (could get pretty upset). If you play multiple times, could even out. But I can see someone being virtually eliminated early on, which is not much fun,

Overall glad I played it, and will probably do so again sometime, but wouldn't buy it based on current impressions.

Played at BGG con 2104 with 6. It's cute, however, it seems to be somewhat unfinished. It has a lot of potential, but some of the card actions that you take don't make sense (particularly shooting). The characters powers are unbalanced, and the component quality is lacking. What you are left with is a great idea, a fun theme and a train. It's a novelty, one that I would play again, but probably never purchase.

Great chaotic programmed actions game with beautiful components and funny western theme. You're trying to rob the train but so are others. You put action cards in shared pile in turns (sometimes they're hidden), turn the deck around and see what happens -this is the fun part. It's pretty easy to teach (about 100x easier than something like Space Alert), interactive, fast and creates laughter. What more can you ask for? 

2-Player Comment:
*It's decent with two, slightly better than with 3. There's official 2p variant to emulate 4p chaos for two, it's not quite the same but there are fun times. 4-6 is recommended for intended fun though.

This is a great "Kennerspiel" or Gateway+ game! Really great! It also plays better with more players IMO and I really enjoy the Stagecoach and Horses expansion. However, I generally reserve the expansion for plays with folks who've played a few times - and that doesn't happen often 'cos I'm always teaching new folks.

I'll definitely get [gameid=191865] and possibly [gameid=192766] and I already have [gameid=169742] and [gameid=196792] and would probably consider more "pimping" as it adds to the fun of the experience. But those Meeplesource extras are just stupid expensive!

Update: Soured on it a bit after more plays, it gets stale and repetitive - while it was never difficult and the hidden cards / punch-cards make it impossible to predict perfectly there is never a (worthwhile) decision to be made.

This one was fun, and certainly a fair winner of the SdJ given the target market and complexity.

Programmable actions is fun, if only to prove that even the best laid plans will go awry. Every time. Even in rounds where every card is played open, something will undoubtedly go wrong, and it'll be a laugh for everyone even you.

I doubt the characters are particularly balanced if you were to play and re-play this title in a very competitive setting, but in a casual relaxed setting is where this game shines. Laughs and mischief abound.

I think this one will need expansions (and I can't see how it that won't happen) to stay amusing for many plays - but as a quick 20-40 minute game that plays up to 6 for great laughs, it's great! Yes, I'm repeating myself but bah.

A fine, or even good, game!

Fazit: Enthält ein paar klasse Ideen, wie u.a. die dass bei einer Fahrt durch den Tunnel die ansonsten offen abgelegten Karten nun verdeckt abgelegt werden. Durch das hübsch gestaltete Material kommt schnell eine gute Western-Atmosphäre auf. Da kann man darüber hinwegsehen, dass das Herausklauben der Schätze aus dem Zug manchmal etwas fummelig ist. Es wird geschossen und geraubt, daher nichts für die ganz kleinen. Hab es zu zweit nie gespielt, stelle mir aber vor, dass es mit mehr Leuten unterhaltsamer ist. Alles in allem kein schlechtes Spiel. Würde ich wieder mitspielen, auch wenn es mich im ersten Anlauf noch nicht vollends überzeugen konnte.

A fun game.  Fancy production (I love the cactus and other objects included just for appearance) and nice illustrations add to the atmosphere.

Good element of recording character damage by including dead cards but preventing wild shooting every turn.

Played once with 5 (all family members)... everyone had a blast.

As others have noted, the 3D cardboard train and other components are really cool, and the game felt uberthematic.

If you like action selection, family weight strategy, and sometimes hilarious and unpredictable outcomes of moves, this is a game for you.

RATING: 7
A cool action programming game with a lot of random twists and turns when playing with more players.

I really enjoy the programming bit and how each round has a different amount of phases and special effects (like tunnels).

I'm not enjoying the actual actions of the game so much though. It's very stabby and negatively interactive and with all the randomness of the game it ruins it a bit for me.

This was a very enjoyable game! It feels like the big bad brother of Cash and Guns, which tends to get a little too simple. 

In this game, you have the same bunch of hooligans trying to get as much money as possible, but instead of a secret hideout you're in a much more exciting train in the Wild West, and you have roles with a special ability as well, and the injection of semi-hidden orders played out as if telling a story, making it a really exciting game. The component design is great as well, going full 3D and really getting you into the theme. 

And that's high praise from me, because I hate Westerns. 

Really really good game, am looking forward to acquiring it and its expansions for my collection.

A new take on Roborally, but less difficult to 'program' and having more options. 

I can see why hardcore 'calculators' dislike Colt Express, but if you can laugh at your own mistakes or misfortunes, then this is up your alley.
Moreover what better fun than to shoot someone down who just stole your money? Not because it will help you win the game, but just because you need revenge!

A fun novelty game that everyone can play. However, the winner is typically determined randomly at the last minute. And a luck based scoring mechanic does not leave anyone strategizing too much. Further, a "curse"/"garbage" based deck building mechanic leaves some people frustrated unable to play.

It's worth a single play at the least for the novelty if for nothing else.

RATING: 7.1
After a bit of a hiatus where, due to absences, transfers and resignations, my regular lunchtime gaming group only played two player card games (primarily Parade) one of our regular players (known in professional circles as Darth Lunch) returned to the fold and brought with him his new yuletide loot.

So far we've played this a couple of times and it has gone very well indeed. The set-up time and space requirements are a bit more than most of the games we play at lunch so we need a bit more time to ensure we finish the game but this is not an insurmountable obstacle. We got our second play down to the 40 minutes as described on the box so that's something.

So far Colt Express is a definite winner. The programmed moves work mechanic pretty well and it's a real hoot trying to anticipate what your opponents may be up to. 

We've only played with three so far but I'm pretty keen to try with more as that should add to the chaos (and the fun). It’s a rather nice touch having unique abilities for each character so each game is a bit different as you try to leverage your advantages to get the most loot.

A great little game, not one I’ll purchase but one I can see myself playing regularly over lunch.

I actually liked this more than I expected to. Chaotic, sure. But a fun chaos. Just enough memory (and hidden information) involved to make it interesting. Man what a pain to assemble the trains though; at least it's done now, and they do make the game more visually appealing.

This game is pure fun! In the old west, program your moves one at a time, then solve them in proper order (First In First Out) to shoot each other, steal money and stay away from the Sheriff!
The more the players, the better; counting the bullets at the end of the round gives very funny moments ("So YOU shooted me 3 bullets, uh? Now wait MY lead, you gangster!").
At the core it's a very simple, fast game, highly accessible and a winner with large parties (4+).

Első társasjátékszabály fordításom. Aztán persze kiadták magyarul.. Köszi szépen! :P
Imádom a vonatokat, és ennek a játéknak a feltűnően gyönyörű, egyedi kivitelezése rögtön felkeltette az érdeklődésemet. Aztán fordítás közben, a szabály alapján valahogy hidegen hagyott, nem mozgatott meg.
Pár hónappal később újra keresztezték útjaink egymást: nyertem egy 70%-os gém kupont. Ismét köszi!
De ezúttal tényleg! Örülök, hogy bekebelezett a marketinggépezet, mert nagyon pozitívan csalódtam. A játék igenis szórakoztató! Az alagutak hatalmasat dobnak a játékélményen (ahogy Ghost is a képességével, még akkor is, ha neki így nincs nehéz dolga). Így lesz a játék fordulatos, meglepetésekkel teli. Soha nem tudhatod honnan jön egy pofon, vagy mikor kapunk egy lövést, hogy aztán meg tele legyünk "sérülésekkel". Rendkívül tematikus! Nem csak a kivitelezés, de a játékmenet is egyedülálló módon adja át a vonatrablás okozta felfordulással járó hangulatot.
Egy pici nehézséget okoz azért a vonaton való mozgás, kell némi kézügyesség is hozzá, de ahogy mondani szokták, a szépségért meg kell szenvedni.

Wie es sich für ein "Spiel des Jahres" gehört, kommtColt Express mit übersichtlichen Regeln und einem leichten Einsteig für die ganze Familie daher. Doch Colt Express bietet auch für Kenner eine jede Menge Spaß, der Vergleich mit King of Tokyo bietet sich hier druchaus an: Jeder, mit dem ich bisher Colt Express gespielt habe, mochte es. Allein das Thema und die schöne Aufmachung sprechen schon für sich. Die Spieler sind Banditen im wilden Westen und wollen einen Zug überfallen. Dieser ist ein echter 3D-Zug, aus Pappteilen zusammen gesteckt - ein richtiger Eyecatcher. Das Spielprinzip ist einfach: Die Spieler haben ein Deck mit Aktionskarten (Bewegung, Schuss, Schlag, beute oder Marschal). Die Karten werden reihum gespielt, allerdings wird die Aktion nicht sofort ausgelöst, sondern erst am Ende der Runde, wenn alle Karten gespielt wurden. Man muss also darauf achten, die Aktion der Gegner zu verfolgen, um z.B. nicht ins Leere zu schlagen. Die Rundenkarten bringen Abwechslung, wenn z.B. manche Aktionskarten verdeckt gespielt werden müssen. Colt Express ist ein kurzweiliges, amüsantes Spiel. Für jede Gruppe zu empfehlen!

What's not to like about a 3d board?  I also like that there's asymmetrical abilities per bandit and that there's some type of combo that occurs which causes you to think on the fly when your master plan goes awry.

Only downside is that fat fingers can wreak the board really quick.  There should be some tweezers or something included to get in the train cars.

I ranked this higher that most others in the forum.  Our family had a lot of fun getting into the "roles" and then acting out our "plans", like real train robbers given  game's actions.  In order to keep it fun, we randomly draw our characters as they each have slightly different powers.

Simple quasi-programming game that is simple to grasp and entertaining to play. Not much feels like it gets done during the game, as actions may be wasted based on other player's interactions, but still fun and worth a play for the family game crowd; for gamers it feels more like a 'super' filler.

This is a nice weight of programming game. it's fairly simple in premise and the theme (and beautiful layout) do a lot to make the game.

I'm still not sure I'm that fond of programming games (as random bad luck or poor decisions from other players can screw you) and I've not been desperate to play it again. Need to try the horses expansion and decide whether I want to keep it or not. I think it's one that kids will love too.

PS. Shame the trains aren't a tad bigger as it can be fiddly reaching into them for meeples/loot.

RATING: 8
Colt Express is a visually stunning game that evokes the 'Wild West Train Heist' beautifully. 

Combining RoboRally styled programming of actions each round (although implanted differently) the players try their best to form a plan and then watch as it goes awry. This element isn't quite as dramatic as it is in RoboRally however and doesn't feel quite as punishing. 

The aim of the game is to manuever around the train in order to collect valuable gems and bags of cash. Players can move vertically to access the roofs of carriages and horizontally to move through the train. This is important as the Sheriff guards a case containing $1000 at the front of the train and it is something of a race to get to it first. 

Of course players can also shoot one another and punch foes, which sees them drop a money bag. 

Throw in individual player actions and random round events to respond to and Colt Express is a really fun experience with an excellent time frame. 

Of the 3 SdJ nominees in 2015, this offers the most fun factor...even if that means that strategy meter is lessened.

Colt Express is a genuinely great game. Programming moves is nothing new in board games, but Colt Express manages to bring a new and exciting spin to it. It's almost like each player is writing the script to a play, just for their character. Then, at the end of each round, all four scripts are smashed together in the hope that things pan out how they wanted. This game could so easily have been designed on a flat board, but the 3d train is an amazing touch. It makes it so engaging and really helps players feel involved. This is probably my favourite 'board game', in the traditional sense. I'm usually more for party games, social games and a bit of bluffing/deduction, but this one perfectly scratches ever itch I want from a board game, and without a dice is sight.

Playing a bandit on a 19th century train, you preplan your moves as in Robo Rally.  You can move, climb up, shoot other bandits or steal loot. The trick is when you get shot it clogs up your hand with cards you can't use. There are various kinds of loot, and the best shooter gets a $1000 bonus. Whoever has the most money at the end of five rounds is the winner.

I'm not a fan of Robo Rally, so this game doesn't appeal to me too much. There are many things that can happen to you. For instance you start in the same caboose with another bandit, and someone else goes ahead of you in turn order and can punch you. Preplanning cards are played face down so you don't know what to expect. Some people like these kind of games. I just try to go with the flow. This was nominated for the Spiel des Jahres, so I was curious about the game. I would expect the chaos factor increases with more players and that could be funny, so this can be viewed as a light filler.

A fun action programming game where you play bandits moving around on a train, stealing loot and trying to foil each other's plans. Each round, you take several turns playing actions into a pile (usually face-up, sometimes face-down), and then resolve all the actions in sequence at the end, so you have to remember what you or others have played and guess at the face-down cards. I really enjoyed the game, but my wife and daughter didn't like it as much.

Program your moves mechanic in a nice light package.  An enjoyable comedy of errors often ensues; you can see most of your opponent's moves as they set them up, so visualizing the board state is important.  Overall a fun and silly little game.  Not to be taken too seriously, limited replayability.

Blagh. Neither for or interesting. The game needs some changes to get me interested for example, more face down cards. Also the game play has limited choices, and there isn't incentive to do one action over another. 
Also the notion that one can play actions solely to disrupt the game rather than serve their own purpose makes this a no go for me. I played the last 2 rounds of this game drawing cards at random to play and it didn't affect my play at all. Will not play again simply because its not entertaining and is rather dull.

Beatufil game - i just love the carts and the overall setup. The mechanics don't blow me away but it's just so much fun. Unfortunately i only played with 2 other people. Avoid this at all cost. Surely it's a lot more fun with 6 players. Might reconsider my rating after playing with more peeps.

Mir gefällt der Mechanismus mit dem abwechselnden Legen von Karten, mal verdeckt, mal offen, zu einem gemeinsamen Stapel ganz gut, aber die Strecken könnten etwas länger sein. Zu zweit lässt der Spielspaß zu wünschen übrig, zu dritt ist es etwas besser. Insgesamt ein nettes Spiel, aber definitiv nicht herausragend.

Easy to play once you got the hang of it. Play cards, plan a strategy, shoot some outlaws, adjust each round how the train moves, repeat. One of those games that looks great on the table. I wish the cards were just a little bit bigger so bumping them wasn't a regular occurrence. Otherwise, really fun and would be a good one to teach to people.

Another take that western game, with a cool 3D train and great programming mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
It takes the action programming from Roborally, even with the wounds that reduce your options, and puts it in a western theme and a superb looking 3D train.

Programming is much easier done here than in Roborally and there's more interaction, but there's [even] more randomness and you have less control.

There are balance issues with the character abilities: some are almost usless and some others are very good. The player that starts acting in the last turn gets a slight advantage.

Overall, it lasts a bit more than a filler should, but everything sums up to produce a nicely themed fun game, especially for those who are not into heavy gaming or whne you're in the mood for something very light.

Amusing mix of "Bang" and "Roborally".  Great components, but I have issues with certain elements of this game.  The player powers are poorly balanced, in particular, and there's very little way to catch up if a player manages to get a sizable lead.  Has the potential to bog down if a player overthinks their card plays.

Partly programming, partly deck-management, but the large part a whole load of fun with some riotous characters and plenty of room to take the mickey out of people who misjudge their whole turn. Can comfortably play a large number in under an hour, which is always a boon too. 

The gratuitous 'extra scenery' is a generous and flamboyant touch which shouldn't be underestimated during a period when games publishers are nearly always looking to downsize.

It's pretty light, chaotic and fun programming, but eventually the card drawing is just a bit too random for me in a programming game. I usually don't mind some chaotic programming and also not some random card draw, but the combination doesn't quiet work for me personally.
Being screwed by either your opponent or by the cards is fine, but the potential for both just doesn't quiet work for me. 
It's still a solid game though and fast enough, so I would play if asked, but just not really my type of game.

Very good first impressions! Does precisely what a good game has to do: It is emotional and social, loud and funny, a bit random but not too much, tactically interesting but not brain burning. And man, it does habe a 3-dimensional train, yay! I would't recommend it for fewer than 5 players, though.

I basically like these kinds of games a lot, yet a bit more of the good old take-that could improve the experience. Maybe a "take six hits and you're out!" would do?

[b]Colt Express[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.
Received in a trade (6/1/15)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This game really took a nose dive after more plays. The amount of random chaos generated by the way program movement is handled in this game really left me wanting a game with a bit more control. The individual player powers were too unbalanced and I really disliked the "advanced" rules (you had to play through all your cards before selecting a previously played card) since it didn't do much to negate the random feeling of how the turns unfolded. Shocking that this one the SDJ, besides some really nice components this just isn't a game that I'd want to keep playing. I don't miss this one at all and neither do my kids.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Colt Express is a great family game that deserves to win the SDJ.
- Amazing components, the trains look awesome set up on the table.
- Wild west train robbers and programmed movement is a perfect paiiring of theme and game mechanism.
- A breeze to teach, you can teach this game as you go. 
In this game the more chaos the better, so no worries if anyone makes a "mistake" since you never know how things will shake out.
- It is FUN! (In a hobby that can be so serious it's great to play a game that is not afraid to be a bit unbalanced, player powers really vary, and quite chaotic.)

This isn't a game that I want to play all the time, but it is fun especially when playing with family and friends. It also pulls people in once it is set up on the table and it can be taught easily, you will be off and running in no time. I highly recommend this game if you play with your family a lot, my guess is your kids will love it![/i]

De acuerdo a los vagones que salgan (con más o menos dinero) los roles no son son todos iguales, de manera que habría que elegirlos antes de setear el tren. Después, que lo balanceen los jugadores a balazos!

Unsure why this boring game is so wildly popular, I guess people can't see beyond the fancy components and the premise that the game looks fun so must be fun. I dislike preprogrammed action mechanics, especially when a round resolves in nothing significant happening. Moving the figurines around inside the carriages and retreiving the loot tokens inside the carriages is fiddly plus the figurines inside carriages can be hidden from a player's view sometimes. There's no reason why this should be three dimensional other than form over function.

Visually this game is fantastic! Getting to move your bandit around a 3D train is a lot of fun. I didn't realize until I played that the game had a programming element to it, kind of like Robot Rally. Things can really change your plans as the cards are revealed, which cause bring laughs (and maybe tears, ha). Each bandit has one special power and for the most part they seem balanced. One or two might be more useful than the others.

RATING: 5
The main draw of Colt Express is that it features a cool-looking three-dimensional train, on which the players move their pawns around picking up loot and shooting each other. Unfortunately, the gameplay is not particularly compelling. Players draw a hand of action cards, and play them one by one to perform actions with their pawn. Shooting other players gives them bullet cards in their action deck, which can limit their choices. The game is pretty much dominated by luck of the draw and multiplayer chaos, there’s really no coherent strategies. Players that happen to luck into some good loot will probably get beat back down by the other players. The game is a romp, and I guess that sort of thing has its fans, but I am not one.

I liked the programming of moves and seeing what others were doing and how to react.  I like the bullet-clogging hands mechanism.  It was a lot of fun and zany.  While I love Roborally, this game plays quicker and easier for a variety of groups. 

The extra cardboard bits had nice theme setting, however were very unnecessary.  The "game board" was a little unstable and very small to grab loot without knocking things off.  The roles seemed a little unbalanced.

This is rooting, tooting chaotic fun.  Wonderful components with the "board" being replaced by a 3D cardboard train. You play an outlaw trying to rob the train, but you are not the only outlaw out there.  Each player places their action facedown (or face up as the cards dictate) into a general pile.  Then, flip the pile over and move your meeple on the 3D train.  Moves are not the only action as you can pick up gems and moneybags; be shot or punched by other players, or be nabbed by the marshall. If you don't like games in which your best laid plans go awry, I would stay clear of this one. BUT....if you like to plan moves not really sure if they will come to fruition as well as play on a 3D train... man, this is simply fantastic
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Colt Express feels like a superior version of Bang! The Dice Game. 

The programmed movement mechanic works extremely well in Colt Express, and the ability to pick up the loot and make the other players drop the loot adds an extra dimension without the downside of player elimination.

The 3D train seems needlessly fiddly to me.  I would have been satisfied with a 2D board. Once you go 3D, the game seems to be begging for a mechanic where the cars become separated and the back of the train is eliminated.

The "gameboard" in this is kind of neat: it's a 2 level train that's also a 3D model. The game is super easy to learn, so this makes for a good family game. The interesting decisions only really come in how players have to plan actions in advance, but instead of being strategic, it's just more chaotic

This is cool and fun, but somewhat I am not as in love with it as I though I would. Perhaps is because I really enjoy the way the components look, but reaching out for them inside the cars can be a bit hard. Also, the card play is not as interesting as I would have expected and some of the characters seem to have relatively useless powers where others have really handy ones.

This is a game where you are a robber meeple with a unique power, running up and down a train robbing people and shooting other bandits. It was a ton of fun with 3 players, and I only see this getting better with 4, 5, or 6 players, as with 3 we were able to predict each others moves ~fairly~ accurately. This is an action programming game, where players either draw 3 or play 1 action from their hand in turn order faceup into a pile (unless the current event says you place it face down, which happens!), then you flip the pile over and resolve the deck from bottom to top. You do your best to anticipate where players are going and what they are doing, but for each time you get shot, you add a bullet card to your deck, which can clog you up on future draws, like wounds in Legendary or Curses in dominion.

Fast paced, fun game loaded with social interaction, mistrust among players, and screw-your-neighbor good times.  The theme is well developed, and some of the mechanics brilliantly integrate that theme (particularly tunnels and swing arms).  Components are high quality, and the game has tremendous table impact.  Rules are intuitive and easy to teach.  
Colt Express is absolutely deserving of the praise and awards it has received.  It is a breath of fresh air in the board gaming world.

Colt Express was sold to me as RoboRally-lite, but the action programming is nowhere near as brain-burning; it’s more of a lightweight ‘see what happens’ affair. The production is fantastic and it’s another that works well with 6, but it’s not something I’d go out of my way to play again.

A fine party-ish programming game. It's pretty light, and the fun seems to mostly depend on the theme, cool components, and the humor of people's plans failing.
It has some strategy and planning to it, but it doesn't feel very well balanced. Some character abilities are clearly better than others, and some actions are clearly better than others.
Basically, play this if you want a light game where you get to run meeples around a 3D train punching and shooting each other.

Fast paced game with high negative interaction between players, as they are wild-west burglars who try to rob the train (and each other). Can be lot of fun, but only when everyone likes that type of play, each fighting another, taking a chance to steal the prize from the opponent.

RATING: 6
This game scales very strangely with the number of players. With two players, each player controls two bandits in a team, but as you have to perform an action if able, you can end up shooting yourself in the foot semi-literally. Have so far only had the opportunity to play with 4-6 players. With four, the game is not too chaotic, as the number of cards being put into the game makes it somewhat feasible to track who is doing what, and to plan accordingly; the tunnel turns are what makes things tricky as cards start entering the schemin deck face down. With five people things get far more chaotic as by the time you get to throw in your next card you sometimes forget what you were doing beforehand. in one of my games someone was punched back and forth, and by the end of the round his dropped money had been picked up by the punchers, leading to a lot of whoop and hollering from the afflicted. With six players things get far more cozy as you start to get a lot more people clustering in the richer cars. The play is notably different with the number of players, despite the various scaling the game does with more players (really only an increase in the number of cars). 

The variety of round cards is nice (seven cards from which you draw four, with a final card taken from a set of three), but I wish there were more possibilities and combinations to give the game more of a chance of odd swings and events, such as end of round events taking place between turns in a round, rounds of all tunnel turns, or turns combining multiple turn types (speed-ups, tunnels, etc.). The game is a lot of fun especially with the right people. In the design journals for this game there is mention of how in earlier versions there were horses and other game elements; I can completely understand why they were removed as the game would likely gain little from added complexity, but at the same time it would be great to have a game with more stuff, ranging from horses to second trains to disconnected cars and dynamite.

Short Version: didn't care for it. Played once and done.

Pros:
* The 3D components help the theme come out a bit.

Cons:
* Two player rules feel tacked on.
* Longer setup time.
* The 3D components make the game feel more fiddly. It is harder to move pieces around and pick up loot and it has a big impact on setup time. Honestly, I think I would have preferred a flat playing surface.
* We love interactive games with a healthy dose of "take that", but not when the interaction is frustrating. That's what this game is about. Each time you "interact", you are either completely disrupting that person's entire turn with little ability to take corrective action or you're making the next turn less fun.

= 2015-07-12

Finally got a chance to play this game yesterday. Not sure what I expected, but I don't think this was it. Having played RoboRally and Kings of Air and Steam, I was at least familiar with programming games and the "hilarity" of having your well scripted plan failing spectacularly, but this game managed only to distill that experience into frustration and boredom.

The two player rules were doubly frustrating in that you were less likely to get the cards you wanted to get a character into position. I suppose we could have burned more turns drawing additional cards, but that just feels like adding insult to injury; you already don't have the cards you need and now you have to give up precious actions to get them.

On top of feeling tacked on, the two player rules were also unheralded. We worked our way through the long and cumbersome setup process only to reach the last page and see *surprise* the two player setup is completely different! It would have been nice to have a more prominent notice informing us skip to the last page when playing with two (note: I wasn't the one reading the rules. If that noticed _was_ there, then I should be complaining about the rules reader instead of the author).

I have no idea how this game got nominated for the SdJ, let alone how it won. It wasn't horrible, but nothing about it said "game of the year" to me.

RATING: 3
There is nothing behind the cutesy 3D scenery that the game is reknown for.
Simultaneous programmable actions where you could get negative cards, not in your deck, but directly into your hand, where they will remain until the end of the game. You can basically prevent a player from playing but shooting them enough time. This just sucks.

Won my first game by a wide margin and still found it completely bland.

RATING: 8
Like watching an old western movie. Lol

.:Best 4:.

My Notes
Rule 1: Team Play
Pick your partner in crime. Team loot are added together including Gunslinger award. For example, one team has 2 shots for one and 2 shots for another but another team has 1 shot for one and 4 shots for another, the latter team gets the Gunslinger award!

Rule 2: Django
Django's shot, like a punch, makes the player drop loot on the car where they were shot. The player drops loot of their choice.

Rule 3: Tuco
Tuco's shot, like a punch, makes the player drop loot on the car where they were shot. The player drops loot of their choice.

Rule 4: Falling off
If a character is punched in or on the Prison Car/Caboose (i.e. last car), Locomotive, or Time Traveling Car, that character may fall off! Re-enter in the Caboose in the next turn opposite of the character that caused it.

Rule 5: Sacks of Gold
Whoever has the most sacks of gold gets $500 bonus.


--
Expansions
//The Time Traveling Car (TTC)

My Notes for TTC
Rule 1: Movement Activation
Use a die to indicate where the Meeple will be instead of players closing their eyes. When it is the character's turn, the player dramatically reveals the die for the location. lol

Rule 2: Shooting from the TTC 
Bandit in the TTC cannot shoot others on the roof of other cars but only to the locomotive. 

// Rock Promo - A place to put the cards.

// Marshal & Prisoners
My Notes for M&P
Rule 1: Mei
When using the Punch card, she punches the character to the roof or to the floor opposite of her.

Horse Card-  movement is one forward or any cars back. Then she needs to play a floor change card to get off the horse and it is her choice as to roof or into the car. She may only shoot adjacent to the car as well as other shooting her. 

Rule 2: Deadly Fall Card
If you punch a character on the roof, you may choose to knock that character off the train. The character returns via horseback in the caboose, the last car.

Fans Of RoboRally, well you'll likely stick with RoboRally.

This game also uses cards to "program" what your Train Robber will do, but unlike RoboRally, You submit most every "command" in full public view one at a time, in turn order.  So Not only do you get to have the frustrations of drawing ineffectual command cards, but the one that might be worth a damn to play this turn are usually nullified by the cutthroat players who can take advantage of their turn order.  I'm not afraid of cutthroat, but I'm no fan of someone else being able to make my very few viable plays turn into inert plays.  In a four round game I spent 3 turns in the same car looting nothing, unable to move from the spot.

This is a cracking good game to play with kids. They love it a lot . it s fun, quick and entertaining. I printed off an a4 4sheet copy of the play mat and it really helps with the theme and the gameplay. I can see this being played alot more in the future. It would seem more logical to play the bullets as health points rather than shots fired for the gunslinger award. Nobody seems too interested in using bullets as an action. Other than it being a bit of fun to shoot each other. I think rather than clogging up the player decks with shots it would be more interesting to use the gunshots to eliminate players from The game instead. I am going to try this in future games.

Wow, I like Colt Express way more than I thought I would.  I was on the fence about picking this one up and eventually found a used copy locally for $15, so I finally decided it was worth the risk.  Wow!  Love this (especially with the higher player counts!)  Great family game, gamers love it too!  Everyone I've introduced it too has loved it.  Had I had the chance to try before buy, I'd have easily paid full price for it, instead of waiting so long.

It was hard for me to settle on a rating for this game. There really isn't much strategy to Colt Express, since any actions you plan are almost guaranteed to be diverted, especially in higher player count games. That being said, this game is still a rowdy mess of fun. It's easy to get immersed in the theme and find plenty of laughs while you cowboy up to cause some mischief. For the most part, everyone's plans get equally ruined, and it's a blast! Overall, a great party game experience.

Total chaos, but in a fun way.  You program your moves (by playing action cards), but the situation changes so much by the time those actions role around that any plans are thrown out the window of the train.

In our limited experience you need to win/tie the # of shots fire if you actually want to win the game....of course winning the game isn't the main object of playing Colt Express!  :)

Pretty fun little game. I love programmed movement in games. In this one, your program won't get fully messed up if you get knocked over a train car. Though there were a lot of people punching the air. I definitely like it, and I definitely see myself playing this a lot more in the future.

EDIT: After playing a couple of 6 player games, this game is actually much more awesome than I originally thought. Like many games, it takes at least 1 game for it to "click" with people. I recommend playing 2 in a row.

I think maybe I have bad taste in games. I know this is a Spiel winner and has lots of acclaim/fans/etc. I dunno, it didn't really work for me. The theming is fun but I don't see how it plays with the two core mechanics of the game -- light programming and even lighter deckbuilding (or deck-destroying, maybe). In other words, it seems like the way you play doesn't mesh super well with the world of the game. It was fun enough -- definitely seems more fun with the full six playing -- but I wasn't wowed enough to want to play this again.

A fun little slapstick game, where everyone can really screw over everyone else.

Bad card draw can really lock you out of an entire round (ie, stuck on top of the train and not drawing one of your two cards to get back down), which is a bit of a limitation on its appeal to me.

Might play from time to time, certainly not a go-to game though.

In theory, I like the sound of the programmed actions.  In practice, there is almost no hidden information so you know exactly what everybody is doing, so the programming element is really just playing actions in sequence.  The game seems to go to great lengths to remove any chance of making a choice with limitations on whom can be targeted in various situations and limiting your available actions each round.  The end result is that there is too little choice for the take-that-spite cards to come into play, let alone anything resembling strategy

09-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. I never want to play this game again, but it has a good theme. In the game you're highway (wo)men attacking a train in order to obtain loot.

At the start of the round, all players play action card in turn order that allows you to move from left to right, up or down, or allows you to hit or shoot someone and importantly the action to obtain treasure. Some rounds cards are played face up, some face down depending on the round card. Player that gets rid of thier bullits gets a special bonus $1000, and there is a container that's worth $1000. Hitting people leads them to drop treasure you can pick up. In the cabin with the $1000 container a police officer hides that punishes you.

At the end, player with most treasure wins. I don't like the randomness, programmed movement nor the way you're rewarded if you just go gun-ho the whole time. Also, it's hard to control when a hit works.

C9lt Expresd is a fun light game where players play action cards to move,shoot and punch their way through a 3Dtrain in order to obtain the most stolen goods.  Players battle each other and program their movements and try to anticipate others moves.

Pros: Extremely interactive. Fun Game play,Fun art and components quick Gameplay
, Supports high player count.

Cons: Mostly luck based, chaotic gameplay

What a game. This just won the Spiel de Jahres, and quite justifiably so. A programming game, Colt Express is a fun and chaoic mess of punching, shooting and looting a train in the old west. This one is seeing a fair amount of play, and is always well-received. Higher player counts are best on this one, and the main reason I got rid of it.

Inkább party, mintsem családi játék. Ennek megfelelően a helyén kell kezelni. Sok mélységet, stratégiázást nem kell tőle várni. Egyesek talán teljes káosznak gondolhatják a játékot, de pont ez a jelleg biztosítja a hatalmas röhögéseket.
A 3D vonat bomba ötlet, a hátán viszi a tematikát, na meg a kis kiegészítő tereptárgyak is rengeteget adnak a vadnyugati hangulathoz.
Nagy előnye, hogy úgy tudja hozni a party játék erősségeit, hogy már 4 fővel is hibátlanul működik. Ha a társaság ízléséhez passzol egy kaotikus bunyó egy száguldó vonaton, akkor nem érheti csalódás az embert.
Ja, és még egy nagy előny! A könnyedségének megfelelő, rövid játékidő!
---
Még party játék jellege ellenére is kissé kiegyensúlyozatlannak érzem olykor. Gyakorlatilag a marsall által őrzött táska megkaparintásával szinte eldől a játék. Sokszor úgy, hogy egyes játékosoknak módja/lehetősége sincs ennek megakadályozására, esetleg megváltoztatására.

Great, fun little game with over the top production values. It's fast playing and good for a few laughs. The wife has given this game her stamp of approval. We like climbing all over the train and punching each other in the face, shooting at people in the neighbouring carriage and all the while watching the tumbleweeds roll by in the distance as we get rich or poor.

Program three or four actions face up on a pile from your hand of six cards (which becomes increasingly muddied up with bullet holes as other players fill you full of lead). Then run through the actions. Do this for five rounds and the player with the most money wins. Easy to teach. Plays in 30-45 minutes depending upon experience. Lots of laughs, taunts and groans. There's a few extra bits that nicely spice things up, but that's the sum of it really.

As much as I like the production (and I do), I'd like to see this as a little card game version down the road. Yes the 3D trains really set the game up well, but it's really no more than an overproduced (in a good way), card game. A travel version in a small box would be ideal for my needs.

I can see why this game won the Spiel des Jahres, but I'm not a huge fan of it. The game is boring with 2, but even with more players I dislike it. In my opinion, players should have more opportunities to play cards face-down to create more chaos (which - in my opinion - is what makes the game interesting).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[1 play]

Fun but chaotic game of programming your moves as a band of non-cooperative train robbers. There is probably a little more strategy to this game than we all played initially, but future plays should clear up the control to chaos ratio. Regardless, the components are very well done, the action moves quickly, and the circumstances that unfold are light-hearted and occasionally hilarious. This is a fast game that can accommodate up to 6 players.

RATING: 6
The main fun in this type of game comes with the way actions can interfere with other players plans. 

* 3D model of the train is always a big draw

* Chaos for the interaction of player actions is fun

* Easy for non-gamers to leard

Two issues I have with the game are:

* Random card draws every turn mean that often you won't have the card you want. This is a bad experience for a new player who just has to toss in some random card

* Sometimes one player can end up at the other end of the train just collecting loot by themselves. While this is a good strategy to win, it can be a boring game for that person just sitting there without any interaction

The game is better with the expert rules where you have more control on the cards you draw. However, I'm mostly playing this game with non-gamers with the basic rules.

Roborally a vadnyugaton. Ez a legegyszerűbb kifejezés, ami illik a játékra. Van egy kezdő paklija minden rosszfiúnak és hat tölténye, amivel egy vonatot próbálnak kirabolni. A játékosszámtól függően van adott számú kocsi, egy mozdony és egy seriff a vonaton. Magában a kocsikban és azok tetején lehet garázdálkodni. Célunk a legtöbb értéket összeszedni. Ebben a játékban nem pakliépítés, hanem paklirombolás folyik, ugyanis jobb lapokat nem kapunk, csak nem használható lövéseket az ellenfeleinktől, amik nehezítik a jó lapok használatát játék közben. Ha kézitusára kerül sor, akkor még egy értékünk is elveszik. Gyönyörű kivitel, emiatt nagyon jól beleélheti magát a játékos a vadnyugati hangulatba. A játék jól működik, vicces, nem túl hosszú, tökéletes partyjáték.

Expansions: Horses & Stagecoach, Marshal & Prisoners

This is a pretty awesome action programming game, working better than robo rally (in its' streamlined nature and more fixed length to play), although unfortunately being a bit on the light side.

I haven't yet played with the Horses & Stagecoach expansion, but I do own it.

Robo Rally-esque game of playing a card and watching what happens. In a shorter game I don't mind that; Colt Express is too long for what it is. One indication of the weakness of the design is to imagine the game without the 3D board. It's hard to imagine it attracting much interest.

1 play (Origins 2015)

Our explainer said there were 2 ways to play the order cards: all in one stack, or each player in their own area (like RoboRally). We played the latter (none of us wanted to add a memory element to the game) but several people later told me that the game is MUCH better with the former -- more chaos and "fun". 

Our game, playing the cards RoboRally style, was just OK. We still had some chaos thanks to the face up/down card plays, but we were each mostly able to do what we wanted. For me, that's good: I don't like chaos just for the sake of chaos. But the game just wasn't all that much fun! Playing cards to one stack would simply add a memory element to the game, which I think would just be annoying. I would much rather play RoboRally, with players planning simultaneously under time pressure and then seeing what happens.

Nice-looking components (although the train cars don't exactly lock together well and are easy to displace) but not much game here. I guess I'd try it again with the cards-in-one-stack rule, but I won't go looking.

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
The "board" is actually a 3D train with several cars, each with one space inside and another on top (on the roof). Players each play a different cowboy/girl bandit, with a unique power. Place your meeple in the train, along with the sheriff and a mix of random gem/money sacks worth $250-500 each. Each (of 4) round, players draw a random hand of 6 from their deck of programming cards. 

In turn order, place an order face up or down (depends on the setup card drawn for this round, modified by any character-specific powers) into a stack -- four or five times depending on the round card. After all orders are placed, they are resolved in the order played. Orders include things like: moving forward within the train or going up/down to/from roof, punching (someone in the same car as you), shooting (into next car, or anywhere on roof), pick up loot, move the sheriff, etc. If you end up in the same car as the sheriff, he shoots you. Whenever you're hit, you add a damage card to your deck and drop one of your loot tokens.

After four rounds, the player with the highest total value loot wins! 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a programmed movement game where each player plays a bandit on a train trying to get the most loot while shooting and punching their opponents to prevent them from grabbing loot and avoiding the sheriff.

I still haven't really landed on my opinion of this game yet.  At face value I really wouldn't normally like this game.  It is pure uncontrollable chaos a lot of times and while there were a couple moments where I was able to properly plan my moves to grab a high value piece of loot there were also rounds where I shot empty air and flailed my arms wildly at nothing.  There is certainly a big toy factor with the 3D train but that's not something I really care a lot about.  I like it better for that than if it was a 2D board but I would never hold onto a game just because of that.

I do think there are some neat things here like the ability to occasionally play cards hidden due to tunnels but for the most part I felt like I had no control and was just watching the game unfold.  But the game that did unfold was pretty fun.  Much in the same way I can get enjoyment out of a random unpredicted turn in RoboRally I can enjoy this game when my best laid plans end with me flailing my arms wildly in an empty train car.  The theme is pretty prevalent and it doesn't overstay its welcome, playing really quickly and accessible enough to teach anyone inside 10 minutes.

There are even some serious balance issues, I think the power for Belle to not be the target if there is another legal target is pretty much the best one of the lot.  Especially with larger player counts where I think this game is most fun even if that increases the chaos factor but I think that's how this game has to be played.  A filler where you can turn your brain off mostly and have fun with it.  Although that novelty may wear off before long.

Program movement with some knowledge of other players' choices. Run, punch, shoot, loot, or move the sheriff. Move meeples on cute cardboard train accordingly. The 3D train and gun-holding meeples are nice touches. The game itself is light. 

Too bad there wasn't "wave hat"!

As a family game this is a hit in our house. 
To Be fair we have the Stagecoach expansion and I think that's all I will add. Without it it's a good chaotic programmable game. 7/10

Add in the Stagecoach expansion and literally another dimension opens up with the coach running parallel to the loco. Horses add another movement opertunity (if there where you want them). Extra mission cards too. Really this makes the base game and I don't want to bog down with any more. 
My rating is based on expansion added for clarity.

Programmed actions a la Roborally but moving meeples around a fantastical cardboard train. Players take turns playing cards, some face up and some face down, showing actions like "move to/from the roof of the train", "shoot", "punch someone", "move along the train" or "move the marshal". If another player's action causes them to be somewhere else -- for example, a punch will cause them to reel back into an adjacent carriage -- then they might find themselves shooting the wrong person.

For all that much of the fun is in seeing people's plans ruined, it's just as satisfying to correctly read opponents such that a plan does come off. The combination is delightful. It is at times vexing that taking actions requires drawing the right card, particularly after you have been shot a few times (bullets clog up your hand). That sort of denial isn't nearly as fun.

Update: I am increasingly unhappy with the bullet mechanism; it's entertaining to have plans ruined by an unexpected marshal (or similar), not so much to require turns wasted drawing cards in order to achieve [i]anything[/i]. Perhaps a variant where they just drop loot would work, as when punched.

RATING: 6
This is a fun game that is very thematic and light. My kids seem to enjoy it, particularly my younger daughter. The only thing I do not like about the game is that your card draw is random, so it can be difficult to do some of the actions you really need to, such as picking up loot. That can be very frustrating because there is only 1 pick up loot card and loot is the only thing that matters at the end of the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fairly random programmed action/pick on your neighbor game.  You often can't pick up money or do anything that is helpful to you because you didn't draw the right actions.  Even if you did draw the right ones, they might not go off correctly because of the programmed nature of the game.  That part seems fine, but spending turns with a handful of movement cards and nothing else just isn't fun.  At that point, it would have been kinder to let the bullets eliminate me. 

The pieces are nice, and the art works to draw you into the theme, but some of the mechanics don't make a lot of sense.  Using all your bullets gets you $1000?  This smacks of "we need an add-on mechanic to get people to be more aggressive."  As a funny, fairly quick "let's see what happens" game, it's okay, but there are still plenty of games in that genre with much better gameplay.

Odd choice for an SdJ: The Robo Rally style of "programming" your characters is not to everyone's liking. In fact, in my experience it's casual players that are very often put off by this mechanic, so I don't recommend this as a gateway game.

RATING: 5.5
Colt Express is a fun idea; you're all running around a train shooting and puching other players, trying to collect loot. The mixture of playing cards face up and face down was an interesting idea, but it never quite lived up to the premise.

Tom compared this unfavourably to River Dragons and I think he's absolutely right; River Dragons is prettier, much more fun and allows for much more entertaining dicking over of other players.

I suspect that the 3D train will keep this popular and it'd make a decent gateway game, but there's little to keep me coming back to it.

RATING: 6.5
Wild West bandit action on a train

+ western theme
+ great artworks in comic style(!)
+ special character powers, modular board
- action programming mechanic often fails
- game balance seems off (loot values differ too much)
- punching is too hard to achieve, shooting doesn't do that much
- a bit too short
- memory aspect (remembering what people played)

If you play it just for fun, it's good.

3/18/2017: Played this game for the first time and surprisingly it is quite fun! This is the third programming game that I have played so far and this is the most enjoyable out of the three (other two: Robo Rally - original and Mech vs Minion). The game components with 3D cardboards to represent the trains enhance the gaming experience. I will definitely want to play this again!

RATING: 4
In a word, lackluster. It's cute, but feels more like a toy than a game. Yes, the components are 3D, and yes it comes with terrain elements that have no effect other than ambiance, but what I actually mean is that the game rules seem like an excuse to play with all those beautiful bits.

It's not that he game isn't fun, but rather that it's very light and chaotic. At no point did I feel much engagement. Programmed movement done right can be a very engaging and rewarding mechanism, but here it felt as though the designer wasn't taking full advantage of its potential. Rather than struggling to program a series of meaningful actions, I felt as though I was merely moving things around and occasionally gathering up some victory points. Decision points felt sort of empty, as though it was the theme that was supposed to carry the weight of enjoyment.

I was happy when the game was over, and I don't plan to play ever again. Even as a family game, I wonder if the novelty would quickly wear off. Oh, and the 3D elements actually became a nuisance as I struggled to pick up and move small playing pieces to the correct location on the train.

Another of my Geekway to the West 2015 games. I found this on the cheap thanks to Miniature Market.

Very cool visual game board. A 3-D train! Program you moves to get the loot. Seems simple? It is not. Other will foil you plan. That $1000 suitcase at the front of the train may not be worth it! Collect a lot of smaller bags/jewels or go for the big score?

Very easy game to teach. Ghost is my go to character.

I'm not a massive advocate for theme, but this game oozes theme. Not only are the 3D trains fun, but the programming actually gives me the feeling of a chaotic brawl, as the characters frantically struggle to steal the loot while fighting off one another on a moving train. I'm not sure I've felt as engaged with a game's theme via it's mechanics as I have this one, and when you combine that with the insanely good production, this is why I rate it so high. It's a joy to play, and makes me want to try more programming games, as it could be a mechanic I find to be very immersive.

This game is really a lot fun.  I've played with about ten different players, all but one of whom were playing the game for the first time.  Every single player said the same thing at the end.  "I didn't care so much if I lost.  Robbing the train was a blast."

Valószínűleg én játszom rosszul, de én rámegyek a "minden golyót lőjünk ki a tárból"-ra. Kicsit rontja a játékélményt meg a vadnyugati hangulatot amikor a pacifisták csak mászkálnak és szedik a lóvét, de végülis ez a játék célja csak én nem ezt a játékot keresem. A vonat szemet gyönyörködtető, a mechanizmus nagyon egyedi és jól kitalált, talán lehetne körönként több akciónk, de ígyis a végén már nagyon mókás, hogy a közelében se vagy ahol lenni szerettél volna addigra.

Light and chaotic game with pre-programmed movement and actions. Due to the interaction you cannot really expect your cards to play out as intended, then there is additional randomness due to the different value of the stolen bags. But there is a lot of fun and take that, so if you are in the mood for something light without much thinking, this is a quite nice game. And the train looks really nice on the table.

Fun game. It's very chaotic because of the programmed actions, but anyone playing this game will probably know that going in. You'll want to only play this game with four or more players. The two player game would of course be awful, and even with three players it can be dull. With four or more there's a good amount of stuff happening all over the train so you should always be invested.

The different characters and different events that can happen, plus the fast play time, make this one a keeper for me.

This is a game based on chaos and lots of things happening, so you need more players.

Had a lot of fun with this with the family. What I really enjoy is the programmed moves can have thought put into them to swing the odds in your favor. But even my five year old can just put in semi random actions and have lots of fun with all the resolving chaos. Also for the price being very reasonable the little model train adds a ton of fun to the game, especially with kids.

Just one play in and I can definitely call this a fun game.  We haven't even gotten to the point of using individual player abilities or the expert variant in the rule book.  So the rating may go up and down.  But for now, with my 8 and 12 year old, this one will definitely make it to the table again very soon.

Aha! Now I can have the pre-programming of turns that I love in RoboRally without having to find players who don't have a problem with spatial reasoning. 

This and the fact that the game plays well up to 6 makes this one a winner for me. The western theme is icing on the cake.

The pre-programming is actually somewhat different than RoboRally and others in that you are doing the programming in turn order with others so that you have a very good idea of what your opponents are doing. So control is there, but not too much. There are still some very funny outcomes that makes the game a joy to play. 

Colt Express also finishes in under an hour which is a great timeframe for this type of game.

RoboRally is still the greatest though.  : )




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

A fun game that doesn't overstay its welcome. It's not very deep, but it is fast and fun. It's a game where the player interactions are chaotic and fun, but it ends before that gets old. Main ding against is that players can really gang up on each other in a way that the game doesn't do a great job of mitigating.

Easy enough to pick up and learn this is the kind of game to get better with more plays as people get comfortable with the pacing, and in my opinion it deserves the spiel nomination as it finds that balance of luck V.S strategy well. The only nit picks I have with this game is the fiddly nature of moving your bandit and picking up the loot, also keeping your discards, deck, and bullet cards all separate can be a little fiddly, but this all comes hand in hand with the fantastic train model and table presence this game has which I think makes it worth it.

First Impression:

A light game that uses stacked actions in a very fun way.

The production values are very high in this one, and the whole train robbery theme carries on very well. The main action stacking mechanism creates player chaos instead of luck, but to a manageable level which makes it fun. The extra player abilities are also a nice touch, and there is enough agony and hidden cash to keep all the players involved to the end.

There is little to whine about this game, other than it tries to pass itself for more that what it really is. For a light fun game it takes too long to setup, and I can see it after a few games when the novelty wears out to slightly outstay its welcome. The theme is also not my cup of tea, as it is both too narrow (just a train robbery) and too distant (western but without the "settling" feeling)

RATING: 7
Someone described this game as "RoboRally meets Bang" and while there's some truth to that, I think this game is vastly better than either of those games.

The game is about a train robbery. All the players are bandits stealing the loot from a train... but we're not particularly on the same side. There's a very cute train assembly that allows players to put their meeple in or on top of the train. There's random look tokens scattered about the train, as well as one marshall.

You have a deck of cards, of which you'll draw six for each round. On a round, you first reveal the play sequence card which shows how many cards you get to play in the round and whether they'll be played publicly or secretly. So the sequence might say that everyone plays a card, then everyone plays two cards in rapid succession, then everyone plays a card secretly and finally everyone plays a card, but in reverse turn order. After all the cards are played the deck is flipped over and all the actions are carried out in deck order. So there's a "programming" aspect where you are trying to plan out what's going to happen based on what you see other people are doing.

So what can you do? First, you can move. There are two types of move cards, vertical movement or horizontal. If you're inside the train, you can move to the next train (horizontal) or up to the roof (vertical). If you're on the roof you can move up to 3 train cars (horizontal) or down to the train car (vertical). One thing that keeps the game from being really random is that you don't have to committ whether you move towards the front or back of the train until the card is revealed in the execute phase of the turn. So if things didn't go how you thought, you can change the direction you thought you wanted to go.

You can also pick up loot. There's three types of loot... briefcases ($1000), gems ($500) and bags of loot ($250-$500). Or you can punch someone causing them to drop a piece of loot, you choose which one, but you can't peek to see how much the bags of loot are.

Or you can shoot someone. If you're in the train, you can only shoot someone in the next car over. If you're on top of the train you can shoot someone who is also on top of the train, but as far away as you like, provided that there's no one in between the two of you. Shooting someone means you give them a bullet card which just clogs their deck.

You can also move the sheriff one car over (he never goes on the roof). If you're ever in the same car as the sheriff, you get shot (taking a bullet from the sheriff) and flee to the roof.

Then you reset for the next round, shuffle your deck and start over, with your meeples wherever you left them and with whatever loot hasn't been grabbed as yet.

Every player has a special power, which makes the game a little more interesting. Some powers, like not being able to be targeted for shots and punches if you're standing next to someone else, or automatically grabbing the loot when you punch someone else, seem to be nicer than some of the other powers, like drawing seven cards instead of six.

The game is a little crazy, but not nearly as much so as most of the other "program your move ahead of time" games. And it's quick and fairly fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[thing=158899][/thing] is a simple game that involves action programming: one card is revealed, at the start of every round (the play lasts for 5 rounds) and it tells the players the amount of cards that will be played in the round, how the Marshal will act, and a few quirks - like, after 1 turn of each player, the playing order reverses, or there will be a turn when everyone will play the card hidden.

Each players has 10 action cards and drawrs, at the start of each round, 6 of them. There aren't 10 different actions, as 4 of them have two cards and the Punch and the Marshal are unique. The actions are:

- Move (x2): to 1 adjacent cart if inside the train, or up to three carts if outside the train;
- Fire (x2): hits one player one cart away (inside the train) or whatever distance if in the ceiling of the train;
- Robbery (x2): takes one of the items in the cart;
- Floor Change (x2): allows to move to the roof or get down from it, back inside the train;
- Punch (x1): hits someone in the same cart - the other character drops one item in the cart and is moved to an adjacent cart;
- Marshal (x1): moves the Marshal to an adjacent cart.

Players will keep choosing actions, trying to compensate for the actions chosen by the others, vying for the best opportunities. For instance, lets say your robber is in the roof of the train, with the Marshal in the cart bellow. Your idea could be to use your first the Marshal, to move him away, then the second a Down card, as the third will be a Robbery card. But after you put your second card (Down) someone, after you, put a Marshal. Now he can come back and destroy your stealing bonanza. Will you risk now the Robbery card (as the Marshal could be used to move further away), or is better to just put a Fire card, to at least have some proper retribution (while also trying to take the Braggart bonus at the end of the game)?

In the same vein, a player could, as her first card, put a Robbery. However, someone else, with his character in the same cart, puts a Punch. It was a risky decision, but with only one Punch, and drawing 6 out of 10 cards, it wal possible that the player wouldn't have a Punch in hand. Now, if she has the second Robbery card in hand, she can try again, but she can't know to which cart she will be moved to!

This is the game dynamics: action cards are added to a deck, in play order, until everyone had the amount of turns showing in the round card. Then, in order, from the first card played to the last one, actions will be activated. Yes, it is somewhat easy to plan when you can see everyone else's cards. But one character, the Ghost, plays his first card face down. And the round cards also insert turns in which everyone will put their cards face down. Then madness can issue! In your play, for instance, one player used two Robbery cards in the roof of the train, gaining nothing, after being sent there by a movement of the Marshal. Definitely a fun sight to behold!

It is worth mentioning that the players assume the role of characters, each with an unique ability. The Ghost, as I said, play his first card face down. The Doc draws 7 cards instead of 6. Belle, if there is another legal target, can't be hit by a Punch or a Fire. Django, when he Fires, he moves the target 1 cart away. Tuco can Fire someone in the same cart or in the roof. This surely adds to the replay value of the game.

Each time someone gets shot, the person adds a Fire card to her deck. So, at first, everyone has 10 action cards in the deck, but as the play goes by, after some shootouts, some decks are polluted with Fire cards and the 6 card draw at the start of the round may leave someone with less than 6 actions (we had turns were someone had only 3, the other 3 beign Fire cards). To help get somewhat around this, the player can use one action to draw 3 cards instead of adding a card to the planning deck, so that, in her next turn, the person will have more options available.

The goal of the game is to have the highest amount of money at the end of 5 rounds of play - usually the best way to do this is by stealing. There are three main items to steal in the train: briefcase (worth $1000), diamonds (worth $500) and money bags (worth from $250 to $500, but this information is hidden until the player takes the bag). Also the player that shot more gains the Braggart bonus, which is worth $1000. Finally, there are some other ways to gain money, due to requirements of the round (event) cards - for instance, all the characters that are in the Locomotive by the end of the round gains $250.

So [thing=158899][/thing] is a fun and light game, easy to teach and to play. The level of the production is really high, with good art and a 3D train - the game even comes with some totally unecessary and cool extras, only there to help set the mood of the theme, with cactus, thornbush and rock mounts. The meeples are also thematic, with large brim hats and pistols. 

There are some degree of bastardness in the game, with the Punches, shots and movements of the Marshal, but, overall, the play happens in a pretty light spirit, all beign mainly for fun, not to be taken too seriously. There is also a high level of luck present in the mechanics, and you have to be aware of this to have a good relation with [thing=158899][/thing]. I can imagine that some player might "freeze" when trying to consider the effect of what she will play together with everything that have already beign played (and could have been), leading to some AP or basically chaotic play with no thought whatsoever. It is a risk, though not too present nor really dangerous.

Overall, [thing=158899][/thing] pleased me, showing itself as a good option to accommodate 4 to 6 players (the game accepts less - 2 and 3 - but it seemed to me that a good deal of the fun would be lost when playing with lower counts). A play will last around 30 to 40 minutes. Final words: I recommended it!

Game in which the players play action cards to create a script. After taking turns playing cards like 'run', 'shoot', 'grab loot', etc, the jointly created pile of cards is executed. This can lead to funny situations and even some tension halfway through the sequence. The only negative I find with the game is that you sometimes cannot react to an action, for example when the first player shoots at you before you had the chance to move. Otherwise, it is a good game to bring to the table occasionally when you have 5 or 6 players and you are in the mood for a light family game. The 3d train certainly helps getting it to the table.

This game is a pure fun :).

Yes - it is chaotic, yes - it is unbalanced, yes - it is mostly a game of chance, yes - some of player's decisions are a bit negligible. As a serious game it has a lot of problems... but wait, it's not a serious game :P.

I played it several times, didn't win a single game and still love it. I love the Old West theme, the artwork, awesome 3D train and overall quality of components (cactus decorations!).

The game mechanics gives you an exact feeling of a train robbery kerfuffle that you may have seen in all this Spaghetti Western movies. There is no time for strict planning, you have to act and be ready for sudden and unexpected consequences.

Not a fan of shooting, punching or killing players/NPCs in general (e.g. Bang, Bloody Inn etc.) hence the lower rating.

I liked the theme of this game when I saw it being played at my local board games club a while back. The train robbery is a classic western film material and each player portrays a 'typical' character from the era. I think at least one of the characters - the showgirl (?) does not carry a gun and this might frustrate some people who are expecting a deluge of gunfire! The mechanics are straightforward although I did expect to have to move outside of a railcar before going up onto the roof which confused me initially. The ten cards each character has form a draw deck, and from memory, you draw six and play these in a sequence in accordance with a template deck at the side of the cardboard train. You can move, climb, punch, shoot or move the sheriff. There were a few interesting 'double backs' when moving this character away from the strongroom. The starting positions of the characters are set, if I understand correctly, so being in a rail car with no other starting robbers is an advantage. That said, as I had the 'Ghost' character, he has the ability of not needing to declare his first card face up. Those with a good memory will be better able to recall the sequence of what other players are doing. Punching successfully means the character punched drops whatever they are carrying allowing the 'old switcheroo' to be done and a quick escape made. I don't like the idea the restrictions on shooting railcar to railcar but accept the game has been simplified to make it easier and quicker to play. I think that an advanced version of the game would suit me better with a few more options once the basics are acquired. It may be that this has been addressed in the expansion sets. I made a few wrong choices but felt this game was good nonetheless and those I played with entered into the 'cinematic' experience in the right way. A good game for me!

Neat little programming game with a cool gimmick (the 3D train) and theme (old west train robbers) which plays surprisingly fast. It shouldn't be this fun to play based only on reading the rules, but nevertheless it is, so the rating is accordingly high.

Here i am again: i have to give a very low rating to a game, i don't like this, but i have to.
this game is completely pointless and random, just a waste of time. What's in it? nice wagons? what else? you play cards without any chance to know what their effect will be and then seeing what happened...and repeat this too many times. it's an abysmally bad game and i really can't understand why this game is rated among the 1000 best ever while so many better game are under 1000. life sucks.

I’ve enjoyed RoboRally in the past, but had soured on it because of it’s length. I didn’t mind the frustration of the game because it was so silly, but taking 2+ hours to play a game of this weight was far too long. Colt Express came along promising a game with similar game play, but a defined game length and fewer options to get tangled in.

In Colt Express you’re a train robber moving from car to car (these are 3D train cars) and stealing purses, jewels, and the strong box in order to have the most money at the end of five rounds. You start each round with a hand of 6 cards that let you move between train cards, move into or on top of a train car, move the marshall, pick up treasure, punch another player (making them drop a purse), or shoot another player (putting a dead card into their deck). You’ll put anywhere from 4-6 cards, typically face up, into a pile one at a time and then that pile is turned over and each card is played one at a time. Sometimes you’ll play the cards face down, sometimes you’ll play two cards at once, and sometimes you’ll play in reverse player order. At the end of your five rounds, whoever has the most money wins.

I think this largely replaces RoboRally for me, and that’s a tough realization. I really like what RoboRally does and how funny it is, but it’s just too long for what it is and ends up becoming frustrating as a result. Colt Express on the other hand, lives up to it’s name, playing in about 45 minutes to an hour while giving roughly the same feeling.

Competitive train robbers looting a 3-D train with programmed actions.  I would call it a light filler but it probably takes a fair amount of time to assemble the 3-D train.  The robbers can be chased to the roof by the marshal and hop from car to car shooting the other bandits, smartly using your action cards to outwit the other robbers to make off with the goods.

Once you get past the originality of the 3d design, the core game is a bit too random for the set-up effort. Also, way too long for what is a filler.

Fast, chaotic fun with a variety of choices about what to do on each turn. Played one 4p game which I enjoyed, the player powers seem to be quite minimal. We did notice that in our game 1-2 players got shot over 7 times whilst other players only had a few hits so sometimes if you're getting behind, you stay behind. I really liked the deck mechanic, in which you resolve the action in the order which the train card depicts. Clever mechanic. Also the game is nice to look at too.

This game is fantastic!  Great player interaction and a lot of fun trying to work your own strategy while avoiding attacks from other players.  You're all simultaneously trying to rob the amazing 3D train, but each player wants to be the richest bandit so friendly fire may cause you to drop some loot.

The game occurs in 5 rounds of 2 phases each.  The first phase has players planning their actions for the round in turn order.  The actions then occur in the second phase.  Each round consists of 4 or 5 turns with various twists to how cards are played, and every round ends with a random event.  Some rounds let you play a card face down, others let you play 2 cards in a row.  The action planning mechanic allows you to get an idea of what is going to happen, but the action resolution never goes exactly as you'd expect.  The richest bandit at the end of the game wins!

Some of the variable player powers are incredibly unbalanced, so we tend to not play with them.

I like this game and it is a smash hit with my group of friends. (This is not a gaming group, so it has good appeal to non-gamers). I will,however,be on the lookout for the right expansion as I think a good expansion can make this solid game into an amazing game.
Other thoughts: the 3-D train is incredible and the programable movement really makes you think of both your moves and your opponents moves. 
I want to keep bringing this game out as I am enjoying it, but I think this game can be made even better with the right expansion.

Only played a single game. I played the character that would only get shot if nobody else could be the target. I won easily because I had the fewest bullet cards in my deck. One player got shot so much he was basically out of the game. After this play it feels somewhat unbalanced to me. Once someone has way fewer bullets than the others that player becomes hard to catch. The gameplay was fun though and the game is rather short, so it can serve as an opener for an evening.

The memory aspect of the game may not appeal to some and render 2, 5 and 6 player counts not fun. The game can do with more playtesting, e.g. starting positions or starting cards (what may be used) may require re-jigging as does the special powers of each bandit.

The game is thematic and components are good quality.

I like pre-programming games, and this was fun and different... and so very over produced! :laugh:  I thought being able to see parts of people's plans as they laid our their cards was a pretty neat twist so you could react to what they were doing... and it made being able to correctly deduce their hidden cards that much more rewarding.  Of course there are lots of funny (and I suppose for some people frustrating) moments when you are punching at air after somebody moved or a whole turn is out the window because somebody does something surprising with the Sherrif, but if you take it lightly and have fun with it Colt Express can be a good time.

The train is awesome, if, in practice, a bit small for actually getting bits into and out of, if you are not a small child. The thematic aspects of the game work pretty nicely; however, the lack of control is not good. The card use and programming takes cues from both [thing=18]RoboRally[/thing] and [thing=49]Mamma Mia![/thing] / [thing=13530]Sole Mio![/thing], with a dash of deck-[-]building[/-]wrecking, yet ends up having the control in Mamma Mia! / Sole Mio!. It. Is. Not. Fun. To program your moves when it is literally impossible — even without opponents messing things up — to get anything or shoot anyone turn after turn. Give the players their whole deck, and force them to choose what's going into the discard, and this game would be at least a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b]; as it is, I did not have fun, in spite of good company and cool bits.

I did not have high expectations for this game, because it had such an awesome (and gimmicky) look; however, it did not live up to even those fairly neutral expectations, for me. May you enjoy it anyway!

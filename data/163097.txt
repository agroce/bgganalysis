RATING: 9.5
Great system and a great subject. The only knock is that the OCS-style of war isn't quite 100% realistic. Still, AFAIK, this game comes closest, and it's fun to play. The Broadfront rule makes the turns go fast, and random events add a little sizzle.

From the fall of Paris to the end in the west. Love the system and lots of manageable scenarios. Usual high production levels.

Quite possibly one of the best hex-and-counter wargames that I ever have played, maybe the best. The various strategies for both sides make it eminently replayable.

What perhaps surprises me the most is that the history has been seldom covered at this scale and in this way, probably because it seemed like a foregone conclusion that the Allies will win. On the contrary, in this game, while the end result may not be in doubt, getting there is a constant challenge, full of setbacks, and a test of one's playing skill and resource management every turn. And May 1945 seems so far off. Great stuff.  

The campaign is a 4-mapper, which makes it suitable for two tables, but the two-mappers and Bulge scenarios are good as well (not the typical OCS, "We chopped it off at 10 turns; good luck, you're on your own.") 

Rarely do the OCS games fire on all cylinders, and this one, so far, does. True to the BGG rating, I simply can't get enough of it.

I've been waiting for this game (although I never knew it) ever since I bought D-Day in 1961, and more especially since I first saw Road to the Rhine.  I'm looking forward to this game to help answer a key question:  just how should Eisenhower have conducted the war after the liberation of France in September, 1944?

Great coverage of late war West Front fighting in Europe on the operational level.
This has replaced Case Blue as my favorite OCS game for the time being.

Excellent challenges for both players, with lots of opportunities for offensive and defensive maneuvering.

Probably shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, but this is very monster-y. Although fewer raw counters than the big eastern front games, hard defensive lines makes it quite dense. The US has a proliferation of dinky independents (as do the Germans; the UK not so much for some reason?) that make for a lot of micromanagement. And like Case Blue and Guderian's Blitskrieg, there is a lack of any sane, playable scenarios. Even Time for Trumpets (the Bulge scenario) is rendered a mini-monster by the inclusion of virtually the entire front line, not just the battle area. I still love OCS as a system, but I wonder if the big-box games are just out my league these days. The lack of decent playable (say, 6-9h) scenarios is a real drag.

Also, I should say I'm getting fed up with the "wall of text" setups for those scenarios. It makes setting the game up take an inordinate amount of time. TfT took me about 90 minutes to set up both sides. A visual setup card, like Mark Simonitch and Vance Von Borries do for all their games, would be a huge improvement.

Playing a campaign game at a convention as the allies. In command of the British and the US around Liege. Market Garden was not attempted as the Germans re-organized in such a way after set up that once we could plot air drops it was pointless. Therefore we dropped some para's in Zeeland, although that drop should have been plotted a lot more aggressive. Oh well lesson learned I suppose. Clearing the Scheldt is really a pain, not sure if I agree with the way the enormous pile of Germans in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen ends up tying up troops there.

Unique in OCS in that it starts with the end of a major offensive, rather than at the start.  The Allied players are faced, right off the bat, with a difficult decision about how to press onward with limited supplies while the Germans steadily regain strength.  Lots of things to try here.

Excellent: WWII Western Front - Operational - Difficult 

Plus:
-Theme: I love late war battles and this game is about my back yard; I know Holland, Belgium, France and Germany all to we'll and I live 400 metres from the Rhine. No game beats the theme.
-The scale is exactly right; not too abstracted and not too small that it becomes unplayable.
-Also related to scale is that you have the full Western Front; if you plan an offensive where do you draw resources from?
-System: frankly it took time for me to get warm with OCS. This game is my reentry with the system. Completely different from anything else I have played. Planning is key, Germans are exceptionally strong: Wacht am Rhein can block Allies or cause a surprise.
-Good variety of scenario's and campaigns: Month 44, Patton  '44, Ardennes...all in one box.
-Consistent & clear; no rules or map ambiguities.

Minus
-OCS Campaign games are a lifestyle; you need space and time. Even the smaller scenario's are big. 
-Why no smaller scenario's?! Plenty of scenario's but why no Schelde & Antwerp one mapper or battle for Aachen & HÃ¼rtgen Wald one mapper or Remagen or Arnhem...truly a missed opportunity
-The map graphics are clear but old school. One player aid is really really old school. I have no issue with it but I would LOVE to see this with Devil's Cauldron style map.
-It pisses me off that the setup takes forever thanks to the same old school way of mention units. I really HATE this, especially for a system and game of this size...

Despite the criticism this is the most complete wargame I can think of.

The cool thing is that it not only enables you to replay the battles but also look at the context the battle takes place in. And there is the mighty Rhine river...

The campaign game is the usual OCS monster game and I only have space for 2 maps but there are enough 2 map scenario's.

I am a beginner at OCS; I knew the System as I owned Batlic Gap but this particular title left me lukewarm. The theme of Beyond The Rhine however is ultimate a sit Comes so Close to home. 

Beyond the Rhine has my particular interest as I was born and raised in the Region.

The only game I know of that offers so many games in one box. Expensive but worth every Cent.

Another OCS entry latest in 2015!  My current home space can only play the three one-map scenarios only.  So it is a costly purchase.  But for OCS, I can always dream on having a room large enough to play it!  If it is only a dream!

The scope for decision making in Beyond the Rhine is more one-sided then most of MMP's OCS games.  The Allies decide where to spend supplies to attack and the Germans just sit there and take it since they can't move fast enough to do much else.  The overall pace of battle is realistically slow with both sides being severely supply constrained.  As in most well thought out simulations of the Western Front the take-away message is that Ike landed far more artillery than he could supply and not nearly enough bridging engineers.  As a result, the Allies are not fighting the Germans so much as the die rolls for bridge repair.  If your engineers roll well you can win, if not, so sorry.  This heavy hand of fate, while accurate enough this campaign, results in far more randomness in the game's final outcome that is usual in OCS games.  Folks wanting a bit more control of their own fortunes should work out the odds of a bridge being repaired and convert that to a fixed number of turns as a house rule.

Materials are of the usual MMP OCS superb quality.  The game specific rules, however, are about one level less clear than those in most OCS games.  Of course, that's still better than most non-MMP/GMT games on the market, so I shouldn't be whining.

I am looking forward playing this OCS treatment of the campaign in north west Europe after the break out from Normandy.  The system is probably well suited to dealing with the supply constraints which held up the Allied advance when Germany was at a low ebb.  And it will be interesting to see a Wacht am Rhein counter offensive in its broader context. 

The reason for the lower than usual rating for an OCS game is that my first scenario was Operation Queen, which was an attempt to breakthrough the West Wall.  Lots of stacking.  Lots of multiple step attacks.  Almost no room for manoeuvre.  Not a great scenario to showcase the game or the OCS system.

During 2016, a group who played the full campaign face to face in the US published AARs as they went along.  The campaign came down to the last turn.

So there is obviously a lot of game in the box for me to discover.

One of the best OCS titles.  The transition from pursuit across France in Summer 1944 to grubby slog through the West Wall and Western Germany through 1945 is modeled in a compelling way.

More OCS greatness.  The altered scale makes the campaigns a very practical 2 or 4 map size.  A few extra chrome rules add only a small extra rules burden.  Maps and counters are, as always, excellent.

Ne Plus Ultra

Roland and company have worked long and hard to produce an excellent operational study of a difficult subject. The time period it represents must have been extraordinarily so. The Germans -beyond all expectations- were able to re- form their line and hold their border fortifications in the face of a continuing Allied offensive. This isn't some simple rout of weak forces in the vastness of Eastern Europe.

BTR doesn't disappoint. It's all there, from Market Garden to the final crossings of the Rhine and destruction of the Nazi Colossus. And it isn't a walkover, perhaps its best attribute. Thanks, Roland, we owe you.

RATING: 8
It is simple to learn and play, but it still holds everyone's interest for a surprising long time.  If you get a bad hand of cards, it only last for one pick and then you pass them along.  Winning a round doesn't seem to matter much, but somehow the choosing feels very compelling.

Great kids game. I've played this with my wife and 6 yr old. We laughed a lot. Fun social interaction game with kids. I imagine that this game with copious amounts of alcohol would be a hoot for adults.  I give this a 7 simply because my daughter loves it and therefore I will always play it with her when asked, its fun.

Which do you like better, mayonnaise or taking naps?  This game is extremely simple but quick and fun for different sized groups.  You have a great advantage if you know someone better, but you'll definitely learn more about people just by playing it.  After playing it multiple times some of the luster does wear off, but it combines excellent with other games like Apples to Apples (which we call Whoo-Whoo Naples).

RATING: 7
The finest get-to-know-each-other game.  Whoonu inspires a great deal of conversation, and is so light and fun that nearly everyone enjoys it.  It's not a gamer game, and anyone who approaches it with the mindset of "I must win" will not enjoy it.  This is always one of the first games that Rikki wants to play with new people, and it really does work when we're trying to learn more about them.

We usually play with a variant where each player gets a few more cards in their hand, this makes the selection process much better as you have more options.  It has some similarities to Apples to Apples, but it feels different because you're learning about the other people at the table.  You also can have fun playing opposites, where you get more points for picking the items that the judge will like the least.  This is often good for a laugh.

fun, but use your own rules.  the components are dumb, and passing cards is dumb.  even the tin that the game comes in is annoying because the lid won't stay on.  just play it like apples to apples and keep score on paper.

I'll use JT's session report to sum this game up:

"Such a stupid game - I won because Terry likes Sailing and Mountains more than Unicorns."

RATING: 4
Cranium Whoonu is basically a crappier version of Apples to Apples.  Everyone pitches in some cards with nouns on them and the current player orders the cards from his least favorite to favorite thing, with players scoring points based on how well the current player liked their card.  So yeah, basically Apples to Apples without the adjective cards.

Kind of a guessing game.  But if you don't know who you are playing with, then it isn't very much fun.  But if you do know the players, then it is predictably dull.

So the game is a typcial Cranium Crap - junk any way you slice it!

Not a bad party game, but not a great one, either.  It relies on how well you know the other players, which frequently isn't the case when playing a party game.  For something in this genre I prefer Apples to Apples.

I like that it's short, but at the same time it's just way too simple for me.
I added some variants to make it more fun, like "What would you bring on a deserted island?" but still, it gets old quickly.
In the end, when I'm forced to play, I turn the switch to off and I play like a robot. :/

RATING: 6
Components: Simple components. The cards are difficult to shuffle. The points chips are nice and chunky. Games that rely on selecting the best from a pool (Apples to Apples, Dixit, etc.) need to have a LOT of cards to promote replayability, especially if there is nothing particularly dynamic about the card combinations. This game needs more cards.

Experience: Fun. I'm a big fan of these know-your-neighbor type party games (Ostrakon, What's It To Ya, etc.), and Whoonu doesn't disappoint in this respect, resulting in some interesting and fun conversations about what we like best, and why, and how exactly we interpret the meaning of the card before ascribing a value to it.

We played a variant whereby we select from a larger pool of cards four cards intended for each other player. Then, one at a time, our cards competed against each other to win a single victory point chip. E.g. we all put forward one card for a player to choose from, and the winner gains 1 VP. After each player has awarded 1 VP, we then all compete for 2 VP, etc. There is some strategy for this, as we might put our best card toward the 3 VP chip, if we think we don't have a chance competing for a 4 VP chip.

RATING: 5
No real "game" here, but I've found this is a very fun, light game for a quick round or two at work over lunch. Very "social" -- it really is true that the better you know the Whoozit, the better your score will be. And if you don't know the Whoozit very well, you sure will when this is over. This is a GREAT ice-breaker for parties, kids at camp, group meetings, etc. But, as I stated above, as far as the gaming aspect is concerned, there's really not much of a "game" here.

I personally think this game is underrated. Compared to Apples to Apples, I much prefer it because it's less arbitrary and more personal; it's "getting to know you" and it suits families, strangers, all ages. I play it with non-native English speakers (students) but remove culture-specific cards and have them explain their thought processes.

An Apples to Apples-esque game where you guess the an individual's favorite 'thing' rather than an arbitrary descriptor. Points are awarded on a descending scale.

Not a whole lot of depth to be found here, but I suppose it is a nice way to get to know your fellow players' likes and dislikes.

An alternate way of looking at (and scoring) Apples To Apples, in fact, the cards on both games are pretty much interchangeable, but I think my group prefers the scoring on this game better.

There is only a small amount of cards so replayability with the same group is very limited (thus, not a higher rating). I suggest breaking out those Apples To Apples cards and giving this game new life (or viceversa!)

Great family game.  Seeing what everyone picked for you is like Christmas morning—my wife felt especially loved when our two boys, a nephew, and I made her ranking of selections particularly difficult; we all picked things she enjoyed, every time.  That's when she knew how well we knew her, and how much attention we pay to her likes and dislikes.

Awright—that's enough sap.

The game can be learned in 4.3 blimfarks (that's really, [i]really[/i] fast) and doesn't last as long as you wish it would.  Calls of "let's play again!" are not uncommon.  Recommended for families.

Bought this game to play with my family and my new wife so we could get to know each other better--or rather just random stuff about each other. Kind of a fun way to do it. 

The game is rather simple though. It plays like Apples-to-Apples but instead of the green card, you are using one of the people playing. You can play either what they would like best or what they would hate most.

again - not a bad game - fun to play with kids / family - the first 10-15 plays (not consecutive) are fun, after that the cards seem to cycle which lowers the 'surprise' value of finding out the other players' interests

Game gets worse with every play. We're probably making a mistake by playing in pairs, since it makes controversial words middling and the game comes down to just drawing the few words that are universally liked/loathed. But if you're not playing in pairs, what's the point of this over Apples to Apples? The sole advantage of this game is that it can be done quickly (especially in pairs!), so I'll pick this over, say, Trivial Pursuit.

Can be talked into playing this once in a while. Like "Apples to Apples," it's just entertaining enough when played to provide some fun, or even arguments. Unlike "Apples to Apples," because of the envelope into which cards are played, it's not so easy to identify who's card is whose, and therefore there's less pettiness. On that basis I give it a half-notch more.

Whoonu seemed to be a cross of Apples to Apples and What's It To Ya.  It has players submit a word to a person where they rank them by preference, getting points for that.  Each player goes once.

One of my few non-gamer games, Whoonu is a surprisingly fun activity, especially for groups of people trying to get to know each other. You can bring it along and play at a restaurant while waiting for dinner, and it will bring out lots of interesting stories and odd facts about people that you never would have guessed. Game-wise it doesn't compare to most of the competitive titles on BGG, but it is worth getting and playing as a purely social activity.

Rating mainly reflects its merit as a children's game.  I can see how it can appeal to adults too, although I'm not much of a party game person.

This one is a bit too much like Apples to Apples for my taste. I picked it up at a thrift store because my wife wanted it after playing it at work.

Fun party game that helps you know other people better.  It runs out of steam after about 2 games, but it is a light beginner or ender for a games evening.

Rated for family gaming. Nice interaction that can lead to plenty of discussion. "What?! You love ____! Why didn't you pick that first?" "You're right, but I love ____ just a bit more."  Tweak the rules to allow a few more cards/choice each round.

Definite similarities to Apples to Apples.  I actually prefer the scoring mechanism of this game, which gives credit for the second, third etc. best answer.  However it lacks the variety and therefore replayability of A2A.

RATING: 5
Not a bad idea and a neat little ice breaker kind of game. It's SUPER fast so playing 4 rounds takes no time at all.  From a "get to know a total stranger" point of view well it's so-so. Wonder if it'd be more fun with family members where everyone knows the other person already...huh, I dunno.

This is better than Apples to Apples.  I like having to rank the answers rather than just choosing one on a whim.

It is pretty much the SAME game as Apples to Apples (judge the cards others chose) but with a few differences. It is faster and the hands get passed to the left so you get to see 4 new cards after each judging unlike A2A which only lets you see 1 new card. Its also faster as you just go around the table once. I'm not one who blames "bad cards" in A2A but this game is hampered but that much more than A2A. *12/27/10 The variant posted here actually improves the game. Having to choose from picking the best for 4 or the worst for 3 makes it more fun.

►PUBLIC(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
☺ Jeu de party / Activité de divertissement (peu/pas d’esprit de "compétition/challenge", gagner/perdre peu importe).
☺ Non-joueurs (jeu simple qui pourrait leur convenir).
® Je crains qu’il ne convienne pas aux plus jeunes (je ne vois pas en quoi il pourrait soulever leur intérêt).

►JOUEURS, NOMBRE(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
# Nombres non-déterminés.

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
- THÈME : abstrait ou aucun.
± Ambiance : est dépendante de l’implication des joueurs.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
! J’ai peu d’intérêt pour les jeux de party et habituellement je les évite.

Jeu où chaque joueur tente de marquer un maximum de points en présentant à un autre joueur désigné parmi eux une carte-sujet que le joueur-désigné doit alors classer du sujet qu’il aime le moins à celui qu’il aime le plus (chaque joueur-présentateur espérant alors être celui ayant présenté la carte la plus aimé pour un maximum de points).

Pratique pour briser la glace entre adultes qui ne se connaissent pas ou peu mais passé l’étape d’avoir "fait connaissance", je ne vois pas quel intérêt il y aurait à y rejouer et donc à le posséder. Personnellement, j’arrive tout aussi bien à faire connaissance sans ce jeu.

The game is too brief, but it's good fun for the whole family. There are no right or wrong answers because everything is in the eye of the beholder.

(german edition - might be different for others): Many cards have quite silly words/things, so it's very arbitrary and random how they get ordered. A few good/meaningful cards means surprisingly high luck of the draw. Quality of the cards is *very* low; don't expect them to last more then 10 games.

Rating much upgraded after more plays. It's much better if you alternate with rounds where you have to play the least fitting card, so 'bad' cards become useful too.

Get-to-know-you party game.  It is fun, but rather than each player playing a card from their hand, I think its better to play 5 cards face up and let active player secretly rank their 3 favourite, and other players guess which card is the active player's favourite.  They earn 3 points if they match #1, 2 points for #2, 1 point for #3, and no points for the unranked cards.

In terms of quality and the length of time commitment (short), one of the best of the Cranium small-box series.

Very nice, kid-friendly party game. Somewhere between Apples to Apples and Attribute, as players try to select what they think the active player's favorite thing will be from among a limited selection of cards they hold. Not quite as interactive or discussion-engendering as I was hoping, but that is largely group dependent. Fun for kids and great for family gatherings.

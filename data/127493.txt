I wanted to like this game as wanted a good WW2 game but it bored me to tears. As for the miniatures. The plastic tanks were decent but the resin ones were badly cast and the infantry are awful.

Non realistic war game focused on infantry more than armor.  Infantry trumps everything in this game (except maybe flamethrowers).

Bolt Action is a light World War II miniatures game. To maintain the light quick play style of the game the rules opt for simplicity more than historical accuracy.  For example: Tanks are rated as light, medium, heavy and super heavy for their armour and their guns. The rules are easy to learn.  The game is less expensive than other miniature games such as Flames of War. This is my favorite miniatures game.

One of my favorite miniatures rule sets.  AS a WWII history buff I love this this system, mainly because it is so great for gaming just about any ground combat situation.  

Naval warfare is not covered, but amphibious landings are.  There are also rules covering off-board artillery, which could be considered naval gunfire in the appropriate scenario.

Great game. Plays fast and fun. Only takes a small number of minis to get started.

The rule books (both 1st and 2nd edition) are horribly laid out for finding rules. Very badly needs an index.

Bolt Action has a couple of good things going for it.  It has a neat random activation mechanic.  Its pinning system works well enough for giving a WWII feel.  So to does its winner takes all assault rules.  

However, it also has some rough spots too.  In an attempt to force players to not use transports as weapon platforms and moving cover, Bolt Action creates more problems than it solves.  The same can be said about spotters which force a player to choose between activating the spotter or the mortar/howitzer they are attached to.  Which means games units start off the table won't have spotters.  Forward Observers can also be an issue swinging the game far too much on too few dice rolls.  I don't know what posses the designer to price machine guns the way they are either.

For the most part the rules are simple though not exactly elegant.  If fact there are many cases where the rules become complicated interrupting the overall flow.  

I would be interested in revised second edition, but the game has too many issues for me to enjoy over the tons that exist today.

RATING: 6
Fun and fast, not particularly realistic in terms of WW2 as is but with some house-ruling becomes a more satisfying game and closer to "reality". Ideal for club night games. Simple to house rule to other periods too. I don't know why they bill this as a 28mm game (other than to sell Warlord figures) - it doesn't seem to work well with 28mm at all (especially when vehicles are involved). 20mm is OK at a push, 15mm works MUCH better

Pin mechanic made everything disproportionately difficult to do.  There was little effective recovery mechanism so the game tended to break down.  Not impressed.

Easier to learn than Flames Of War, with a wide array of army choices and units available.  Dice-draw mechanic means games aren't predictable, and you can even roll solo if you don't mind playing both sides.  If I have a complaint it's about all of the modifiers that can creep into the game, and trying to keep all of your particular army's abilities straight.  Best to start with just 1 army and learn that one thoroughly before attempting to dive into other factions.

******************************************************
* I have just the hard-back rule book for sale/trade *
******************************************************

These rules are a simplified set of rules for WW2 (somewhat) fast-play miniatures wargaming.  This is NOT a *board* game.  This is a set of miniatures rules and ownership of scale figures, terrain and vehicles for World War 2 era tactical gaming is required.  Also please note that due to the nature of these rules and how they are marketed your total cost to play the game (NOT including figures/terrain) will actually be at least 2 books and most likely 3-4 books total.

Hosted several (large) games at Texicon in Forth Worth TX May 17-19, 2013.

These rules are *flavored* with World War Two historical aspects and I would never attempt to call these a simulation or even a historically accurate skirmish wargame as they simply do not produce nor require nor even encourage "historically accurate" or even reasonable choices from the players to be successful.

The game is designed by the same person that developed  Warhammer 40k and is a (VERY) obvious attempt at using the same rules design method where everyone gets something 'special' in their "Army List" and general rules are stated, and then numerous exceptions noted in the dedicated sections for various weapons, armies, units, etc...

Why many people seem to think this makes the game "simpler" and easier to understand I do not understand as this type of game design requires players to remember many and an continuously increasing number of "special rules" or exceptions for differing units, weapons, etc. that are released with each new "Army Book".   And of course they are not very well balanced nor even historical in their impact on game-play and unfortunately (history has shown) it tends to only get worse with each new book published as the company tries to sell the "newest release".

But of course it does make everyone "feel special" and sells lots of "Army Books" with pretty glossy pictures.  And this system seems to be quite liked by many gamers even with the loss to playability, balance and accuracy to detail (and your wallet as you buy each new "army book").  I expect this to be quite a popular WWII skirmish "wargame".

RATING: 10
This game brought me back into wargaming. The dice draw mechanic adds a lot to this game, it is almost chess like at times when you need to wait for your opponent to move before you can do what you want with a particular unit, but whose dice will come out first?

The rules are simple to remember from game to game, special rules are at a minimum compared to every other wargame I have played personally, and you only do a very small amount of looking through the rules during a game. 

Just bear in mind that terrain is very important in this game, and as with all wargaming terrain not everything is covered in the rules, so be prepared to house rule your terrain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice system and tabletop alternative if someone was wanting some 28mm WW2 wargaming. Neat pinning rules, you could potentially eliminate a unit just by unloading on their position. 28mm WW2 stuff is a lot cheaper than Warhammer 40k stuff on that note.
6/8/17: Currently have x3 armies (German, US, Russian) and x2 1st ed rulebooks (might keep one for reference depending on trade), order dice from starter set, custom screen printed bag for dice. Willing to trade, I honestly want to switch out to cheapie plastic army dudes for the novelty, but would prefer all of it to go at the same time. At a guess I'd value the lot at somewhere around $300 +/-

Great game play, but can be a bit expensive game. 
Don't like the money grab policy of the company. You buy the rulebook, then buy the campaign books, then you have to buy the armies books (a book for each army), to have access to the units stats.

RATING: 7
Fine simpler skirmish set of rules for WWII minis (I've used 28mm). Sets are nice (although somewhat expensive) and the books clearly show their publishing origins and are handsome editions. So fast to learn and teach, not super detailed (which may be a minus to some) and armor not quite balanced. The good thing is it is actively being produced, is available from Warlord Games (or other online merchants) as well as ebay. I think I like Battlegroup Kursk/Overlord better but would need to play a few more games. Definitely has more of a Warhammer feel to it but overall this game fits the bill for doing conventions or more beer and pretzel fun WWII miniatures game.

Currently getting back into board games after a long absence. This game is easy to learn but offers enough complexity  and variation to keep it interesting. I really enjoy the “pinning” system.  

It is best playing at platoon level, going smaller is easy but a bit pointless. I think beyond company level you should look else where, the model start up cost for that alone would be quite a burden.

I generally play 1000 point battles and will be finished within  2 hours game time. That said the set up of the board and the force selection you can add on up to 30 mins in my opinion.

Down rated to 7 after playing a bit and seeing the cracks in the system. Too many rules in this system don't make sense and there is no apparent line on realism vs playability; some rules are far too light to simulate real situations while other rules are overly complex without adding anything to the game. 
A good intro to mini wargames but I'm moving on to better systems now.

Too many figures needed for my personal taste.  I much prefer smaller skirmish action.  However, I may try it with 1/32 on my floor just for fun.

I do like the series of Finnish minis though, so may use them for other smaller games if I get up the nerve to buy any.

RATING: 8
A nice straightforward enjoyable WW2 skirmish game. Plays in about 2 hours or so; about 60 figures and one vehicle per side. 
The system is designed for 28mm figures available from Warlord games, though other scales can be used.
Played several times with my ten year old son and he grasped the concepts quite quickly.
Have written and played a WW1 variant (with which I use 20mm figures).
The only drawback is the cost of the 28mm figures and vehicles, though cheaper options (i.e. 1/72 (20mm) plastics) can be used.

A lot of the concepts involved here are really cool, but the infantry figures sold by the publisher look horrible.  I'm not talking about details either.  Its the proportions that often just aren't right and look comical or just strange.   Forearms, hands, heads are just out of scale with the height, figures are often all very bulky.  Not representative of what most humans look like.  In fact, I'd say dare few actually resemble the figures in question.

I am absolutely blown away by the enjoyment I have playing this game.  Simple but lethal. Tank rules are abstract and that's the way I like them.  The rule book is professional.  Many people are playing in my local area. Big thumbs up from me.

Not perfect by any stretch but easliy one of my favourite games. Its easy and fun to play. The pinning and activation system make this game.
Ignore the people who call this 1940K, they have no idea what they're talking about and have probably not played it.

Lowered my score. Game is currently massively broken in favour of nations with newer army books, power creep evident. My above statement is rapidly becoming sour.

Good game with simple, straight-forward rules.  Not a simulation but does cover many factors like cover, different weapon types and national special rules.

For Trade includes: Core rulebook, Armies of Germany rulebook, 40+ US infantry including bazooka team and metal 30mm LMG team; 20+ German troops; plus a US Sherman and German Panzer IV plastic tanks in 1/48 scale.  All models are built and painted to solid tabletop standard.

At the core of this I'm sure is a good enough game, that, with some tweaks, I'll be able to play from time to time with friends. I'm a bit underwhelmed by it though. While there is some interesting mechanisms, other parts feel like 40K in feldgrau.

How can a rule set for WW2 have such detailed rules of figuring out which level of a multi-story building an indirectly fired shell will explode on but have no rules at all for entrenchments!? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Yup, it IS Warhammer 1940K - fun, fast and firmly in the "game rather than simulation" camp. 
It's not a carbon copy however - the game has some excellent mechanics, including a clever unit activation system which breaks the IGO/UGO grind of it's various ancestors. 
If you like your games to feel like a Saturday afternoon war movie, you should definitely grab a copy!
Me? While I appreciate the game for what it is, I prefer a little more pulp in my Pulp games, and more grit & shell-casings in my WWII.

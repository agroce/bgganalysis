Love the leveling system and action dice allocation system!  Unfortunately the game plays a bit long, components are lackluster, and it can be a little too random.  Plus the rules are terrible.

Humoristic Cooperative Dungeon Crawler. I think is not a game well done. The rulebook is a mess, the characters are disbalanced and the components are poor. If I have to play to a Dungeon Crawler I will prefer others before this one.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Still not really sure how I feel about this game.  I think the dice pool mechanism it uses is very interesting and innovative.  Not sure I really like the "race" aspect of the game (which is something I hated about Descent).  When you die, nothing really happens, other than you fully heal, and your party gets one less turn to complete the mission.  Eh.  Game would probably also be more appealing with Mini's, as by today's standards, its hard to play these types of games with the quality of pieces we had back in the 1980's.... 

My wife did seem to enjoy it, and i suspect we will probably play through the campaign at least once.

RATING: 9
I love it! The more I play it, the more fun it is. At first I thought it's difficult, then I got a little bit more experienced and the difficulty level grows with me. The closer to the end you are, the more fun it gives you. Such a great game with so many elements! Definitely worth playing. And buying, to play many times :)

The dice spending mechanism is interesting and makes you think a lot more than most dungeon crawlers.  That said, the constant calculation of probabilities does slow the game down.  What keeps the game from being a favorite:
1) Lack of loot.  It's there, but spending the time to get it is risky, and most of the loot isn't that powerful.
2) High level of randomness.  Everything is random: how far you move, whether monsters wake up, how many monsters spawn, what loot you draw, etc.  Managing this is the point of the game, but it gets tiring quickly.
3) Constant respawning of monsters.  It keeps the pressure on you, but gets tiresome having to constantly deal with nuisance critters at your heels.
4) Lack of monster variety.  At the base difficulty level, all of the monsters behave the same: run up and melee someone.  The higher difficulty levels add special powers / behaviors, but I find rather than making combat more interesting they just make it more difficult - which leads me to the last point:
5) The game is hard!  Coping with all of the randomness was fun at first but quickly became a chore.  You either overspend dice to make sure you have a good chance to succeed - in which case you may run out of time to complete the level - or you take risks that can lead to players getting knocked out, which costs you a turn and so again you run out of time to complete the level.
Anyway, I'm glad I played it, but I don't see me seeking out more plays of it in the future.

Enjoyable dungeon crawl with a really slick dice activation system.  It really flows well and allows for meaningful choices that are never brain burning or convoluted.  It's elegance reminds me of Claustrophobia a bit.

I did find myself wishing it used miniatures though and maybe took itself a little more seriously.

The 9 is because is not so easy to find a game playable with kids, 6 - 11 yrs old, than enforces cooperative playing, where kids dont need to suffer because of who wins or loses, because No need of Gamemaster, and with a "long - term" campaign included. (measure this in kid time-length) 


Easy to add Fog of War, you can double as GM and player and release info to the players as discovering rooms.

Nice game to introduce people to Dungeon Crawling or even D&D. It looks like a kid's game but it might be a bit too complex.

Played + Elynor mission 1 (heroic), beaten.

Mistakes made: 
 - we didn't roll to see if monsters awake when fighting in an adjacent room
 - dancing blades lasted the turn, even when no longer in the zone of 2 monsters

We managed to win with 1 turn to go. Very exciting at the end!

I thought the way the special powers interacted with the dice was clever, in that beefing up didn't automatically make you an unstoppable killing machine.  Some of the powers did seem to be a little out of whack, but it was still fun on the whole.  My only real complaint is including guns in a fantasy world.  I hate that shit.

Fun dungeon crawl.  It's very simple for the genre, but still a little too many rules and too much accounting for my taste.  I was in the mood to goof off and have fun, and learning all of the rules and exceptions was more than I was looking for.

Dungeon crawler cooperatiu amb estética "munchkin". Molta influencia del atzar (tot es fa amb daus i crec que hi pot haver massa variació en el resultat). Sembla que té mecàniques interesants, però em dona la impressió que pot quedar un joc massa "light", al nivell dels D&D Adventure System o Claustrophobia/Descent.

Great components (and good quality standees - but perhaps too many to have justifies minis which would have doubled the price of this relatively cheap game).

Tough game if you roll badly when spawning monsters - too many and you can get bogged down in a room for ages due to monsters zones blocking movement. Fun to play and nice cartoon artwork.

Y otra cosa, el sistema de juego, con los dados, tiene mucha más chicha de lo que parece en un primer vistazo.

1 partida y en inglés.

A todos nos pareció un nivel de dificultad imposible y aburrido.

--------- Edito con mi segunda partida y en español ----------------

Creo que la primera vez lo jugamos mal. Porque en esta segunda partida me ha parecido que tenía un nivel de dificultad bastante ajustado, con lo que cambia totalmente mi opinión sobre el juego.

La verdad es que está bastante bien y, además, puedes jugar con hasta 6 jugadores e incluso solo. Para mí la única pega son los dibujos y los personajes/monstruos, que son tipo dibujos (no le pega a la temática para nada) y no hay miniaturas, sino cartones con peanas (aunque obviamente si hubiera minis incrementaria el precio considerablemente).

El juego en sí es de mazmorreo, con personajes con distintas habilidades y con una misión a completar en cada partida. Colaborativo obviamente.

After playing it once, the jury is still out.  I thought it would be a simple crawler, but it ended up being a bit fiddly.  Lots of things to remember.  Long set-up time because of numerous little bits and pieces.  NOTE: Game publishers...please...PLEASE do not use little tiny chits for everything (all the size of the chits in Zombies!!!).  Use good components.

The constant re-spawn of monsters got very tiresome.  On first glance, other than in the starter scenario, most of the monsters are unwinnable...especially the bosses.  There don't seem to be enough dice to achieve the numbers needed to defeat them.  Also...one wound per hit drags battles out like old school D&D.  Some good weapons for the characters would have been better.  There is not enough loot for the characters to find, and dice rolling for movement was obsolete in the early 90's.

I think it could have used some more refining.  And...and this was almost a deal breaker...the rule book is written poorly.

I am hopeful that after becoming more familiar with the rules and flow of the game, that it will become more fun.

Simpler and faster than other games of this genre. The cheap production "no miniatures and fun not serious art" is deceiving: the game features cool mechanisms (dice allocation to do all actions is great!!), more decisions than usual and lots of fun.

Distribution is an issue (at least in Spain).

Edit may-14: dropped from 7.5 to 7
I've only played one game, but the dice allocation mechanic, my main interest about this game, has dissapointed me. It's only one game, but I've failed to notice a big change because of it. I still like it, but it's not the revolutionary concept I thought it was.

26-10-2014. Rated after 2 plays. Cooperative dungeon crawler for 1-6 by Red Glove from Italy.

The game comes with 6 prebuilt missions, that determine the layout of the dungeon, the location of enemy minions and the objectives. The game runs over a certain amount of rounds as determined by the chosen scenario. 

First all chosen heroes get their turns. The player collectively determine turn order. When its the players turn, s/he activates his/her hero and gets a dice pool with 6 dice. The heroes in principle have unlimited amounts of actions that they can perform with those 6 dice, but the success of your action is determined by rolling a certain amount of those dice. Each die side has either a certain amount of swords or a star. In case of a star you refer to your heroes statistics and sum that with any swords rolled. Otherwise you just sum the amount of swords. For example, you can try to open a door by assigning and rolling 1 die, but your chances of success are small. In contrast, you could assign all 6 and therefore be certain that you open it.

After all heroes have had their turn, the monsters activate. They basically walk a few steps towards the closest hero and (preferentially) attack heroes of a certain color first. 

It's a very/extremely light dungeon crawler, but due to the dice pool mechanism a fun game for me.

There are a lot of good things going for this game. The characters are unique and have interested powers that you can activate on occasion. There is a nice experience and leveling system where your powers get stronger throughout the game. But, the biggest feature about the game is the action dice system. Each turn you get 6 dice that you can use to do your actions. Each die has 1, 2, or star. If you roll a star, you add whatever stat you have that applies to the action like strength, aim, magic, etc. You can choose to spend as many dice as you want on an action, but for most actions you need to reach a target number that is usually between 4 and 6. Against the boss it was 15. So, you are always trying to decide if you want to spend the extra die to increase your odds. The components are hit and miss. All of the heroes, monsters, and doors are cardboard standups that are kind of lame. But everything else like chests, barrels, and columns are really nice.

The one game I played ended in an anticlimactic way because all you had to do to win was open the door behind the big bad boss. Our mage character teleported behind the boss and opened the door no problem. So, it ended up kind of lame, but I think the game has a lot of potential. I would compare the game most closely to Mice and Mystics, but with a much better combat/leveling system and without the story. This could definitely work with kids.

Brilliant dungeon crawl. The designer obviously had in mind a lot of fun and action, and he succeeded!  He cut off all the fiddly rules of other dungeon crawls and kept only the essential ones - and made them even better! Some great ideas: dice pool, restrictions on range, hit-or-miss combat, XP, great flow of play with no obstructions. Therefore quite the opposite on fun-range to Descent. Wish Mice&Mystics had such clever game mechanics.

(After 1 2p game April 2014) - This is a pretty good light dungeon crawl, which is outside my normal genre of games (Euros).   The first mission on our learning game play was fun and we plowed through most of the dungeon, but could not win.   Not sure how many characters we should have had in a 2p game, but only 2 felt light when going up against some monsters.

The rulebook is a little tough to follow - could have used a native English speaker to edit it.

Scenario based fantasy co-op dice driven dungeon crawler. Modular tiles and lots of 3-D doors and dungeon furnishings to set up. Flip door switches, make magical checks, hopefully disable traps and all manner of dungeon tests. Countdown race to get passed the big snouts and other minions, brutes, and tests to face and defeat the big boss. Managing your dice pool is a very clever trade off between number of actions and chance for success. Simplified combat system is range based and doesn't use line of sight. Different levels of difficulty on the cards is easy to implement. Rolling stars and the leveling up on the xp track to build up charges in special abilities is a lot of fun. Thankfully, and as the title suggests, the monsters, player characters, and character abilities are creatively different than standard fantasy--Yay. There is fair bit of rule exceptions so be prepared before bringing this to the table. Even so I can see why this game is getting attention.

Four games in and wow! Only played with 2 and it's fantastic - can't believe the Mayfair edition actually says it doesn't play 2 when it's one of the best 2 player games I've come across. The moans about lack of conflict 2 player are nonsense - you're playing it wrong if you think this (i.e. way too weakly) - it's an incredibly aggressive game which can turn back and forth because you've so many tactical and strategic options. Best Knizia, I've played.

I really don't see the appeal.  I should probably play again, just to shore up my opinion, but I pretty much hated playing it.  I felt like whoever draws the most blue tiles is screwed, and the one time I played it was me.  red tiles are way more valuable than the other colors.

Reiner Knizia. It's his masterpiece, heck even Pandemic game desinger, Matt Leacock mentioned it as (close as can be to) the perfect game.

A game that scales perfectly no matter how many opponents.
A game where you never tire of possibilities to win your next game.
A game I can fall back on if there's only one other person to play with.

I've fallen in love with Knizia's simple, player-driven games, and Tigris and Euphrates is no exception. Of all of them, this one seems like the game with the most meat in the strategy. Samurai is great, but T&E appears to offer a depth that may even rival chess. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I'm very much looking forward to learning this game deeply, and it may one day become a perfect 10 game for me (we'll see as my relationship with it develops).

Knizia's classic abstract strategy game has never been a favourite of mine. The design is brilliant in its elegant simplicity, but despite the simple rules there is a very deep strategy game hiding beneath the ugly surface and the steep and long learning curve. Many people, myself included, just aren't interested enough to suffer through the painful stage of "learning by losing" to care for finding it. casual gamers should avoid this game like the plague. 

The balanced scoring is typical for a Knizia design and works well, but the main problems are still "the rich get richer" and the luck of the tile draw that can really screw you over, especially in conjunction with the warfare mechanism. 

Aesthetically it's also very poor, but that is trivial.

An extremely strategic and brain burning Euro. 
Some consider it a bit bland and it is certainly on the more abstract side of things, but I don't find it bland at all - the main theme of the game - the ebb and flow of the ancient civilisations on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates comes out really well in this game, and the strategies are deep and engaging. Better yet, it is highly playable as a two player game which most Euros aren't, and that is a big plus because I am not sure about the downtime and the AP that will be exhibited with more players.

RATING: 10
The strategy is still not transparent to me. I like it because of this challenge, and because it does not ressemble the other games I play. My only criticism is that if you make 1 mistake (or even one critical battle is won against very stacked odds) it can doom you with very little hope of catching up.

E&T is a heavy, intense offering from Knizia that I am not often able to play. I think this game would really blossom with repeated plays. My friend tells me that after three or four plays in a row, and lot of incredible depth and ease of play opens up. I'm not sure I have the stamina for such an experience, but I can see why people would want to do so.

This is clearly one of Knizia's best.

Only a couple of plays so far, but I love this game. This is very tight, tense, competitive strategy game. Every move each person makes matters and can dramatically shift the game. The players drastically affect the game.  One game I played had every monument come out, the other one didn't have a single one get built. On the other hand, it had far more wars. I love the elegance and uniqueness of this game.

Simple rules make this an easy game to introduce new players, but the strategy can be subtle. Limited actions make the game run smoothly, yet not so limited as to deny interesting decisions. However, despite how well-crafted the game is, I don't find much desire to bring this to the table. It may just be a problem with my play group, who I feel are a bit passive with this game, but even the more interactive sessions feel a bit dry and underwhelming. I definitely love the victory point system and the fact that your points are hidden.

Update (12/07): After gently pushing my group in a more aggresive direction, the game became much more interesting and fun. 7->8

RATING: 10
I believe T&E to be the ideal game, sitting somewhere between conquest and german mechanisms.

If you play tactical battle games (such as Risk), you'll notive that games tend to last for may too long. Units are generally numerous and fights are usually dice fests.
All the more, if you play with 3 or more persons, player eliminations tend to occur before the end of the game.
Tigris & Euphrates provides you with the benefits of territorial conquest without those drawbacks.
It allows a better pace through a subtile tile placement mechanism which replaces troops moves and offers a score system with which you can "loose a battle without loosing the war".
If we consider the conflict resolution system, through tiles in hand, it favors deduction and instinctive play, in opposition to cold calculations.
Those conflicts, which are almost "games within the game" are considered very carefully by all players because they have the bitter taste of sand for those who lose them and a wonderful flavor for those who win and for who the supremacy is revealed on the board.
With practice, you can better estimate your chances of winnong and better "read" the board and your opponents placements. T&E really develops itself through extensive play. You can improve your tactical skills and practice the art of bluffing, which sometimes allow to deal properly with a poor hand of tiles.
At last, the game materials are splendid with those large wooden leader disks at the "color" of each of the player. Between the two versions of the game (german / american), i'm entirely for the older version which distinguishes by its sobriety and the easy-to-read board and tiles.

Among the blames set on the game, there is its difficulty which makes it a proper game for experienced players only, a lack of them (regularly argued) and the luck factor (the importance of the "red" color).
If it's true that T&E cannot fit everyone's needs, the other criticisms are, to my point of view, untrue. Reiner Knizia said, on Geekspeak, that the theme of civilisation raising and falling was at the very origin of the game. It is true that the game is very much streamlined but it was made towards improving the flow of the game and keep a certain simplicity. It does not hurt the joy of playing.
At last, variety rules within the tiles in hand and statistically improbable situations do occur. Those elements provide length of play to the game. As games are played, you have to adapt to your hand as much as to the board and seek the advantages of both. All the more, monuments and treasure provide solutions to deal with the luck of the draw.

If I only had to make one statement against the game, it would be related to the turn order. As proved on the BGG interface, first persons to play have a double advantage of choosing their starting location and of being potentially able to play more than other players.
This small drawback is the price to be paid for a very good game and it is up to the players at the table to remember it and compensate favor of destiny.

I have played this a lot on the iPad, and I'm glad I held off on purchasing a physical copy until I was well-immersed in the hobby. It's a simple enough premise, but has very deep strategy and is too dry for most of my gaming partners. Ultimately, there came a point in my collecting, where I knew I needed a copy of this game for my collection to feel adequate - it's so weighty and significant a title. I don't suppose I will find other players for it often, but it is nice to have. The physical game looks beautiful too.

1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Strategic gameplay with many choices on how to try to strengthen your position on an ever changing map. I like how the conflict is different than a war game, it's based on tiles, but then after a conflict the tiles clear out offering opportunities for other players. The lesser-of-four point system is a great mechanism, it forces players to push for different colored points at different times in the game.

DISLIKE: Big plans can go awry with one simple catastrophe tile, quickly changing the state of the board, which means the game can feel tactical over strategical. The tiles drawn can be random, also stalling strategies. The game can get a little long from analyzing the board state each turn. 

OVERALL: Very good game, a true classic. It is an aggressive game, and can be debilitating, but players know this going in. Also helpful to know is how different combos in the spacial puzzle can be good or bad, because new players should not unknowingly be leaving opportunities for experienced players early in the game.

It feels like Samurai, but I like this a bit more.

This is a fascinating game that I am hoping to play a lot more in the next little while.  There is a ton of emergent gameplay here and after about half a dozen plays I'm really not sure how to play well at all.

Unfortunately I'm finding it hard to get to the table since it is fairly dry/abstract and doesn't have the chrome to appeal to a lot of gamers.

Played it again.  Wow, is this game amazing!

Own the app now as well, but the AI is pretty weak.

This is one of those games that has rightfully earned its place in the top 10 games of all time. True the theme is weak (although I think it's not all that bad really), but the system is so simple and so deep - it's really wonderfully assembled. The lowest score of your set of scores wins, so you have to carefully balance all opportunities. An experienced player will definitely trounce a new player and equally skilled opponents will almost certainly be determined by the luck of the draw. Still, no doubt this game is smart and thinky. Wonderful!

This is clearly a game of great depth and is chock full of tactical play.  I'm not so sure about Strategy - sure there is some, but the game can be so fluid that in any one or two rounds tactics seem more prevalent. I was expecting the game to be 100% non-linear, but actually this is not quite the case.  Players can become entrenched within match-winning Kingdoms.  Ok, so this can be nulified, but there was more of that type of play than I'd been led to expect.

It is clear that monuments are incredibly powerful and that late eternal conflicts launched from a powerful base can swing games that are quite even up to that point. A lucky draw of tiles at exactly the right time can be a big blow to your opponent. 

It's certainly heavyish and not the first game I'd pull out for two hours of fun and social-interplay, but it's a good brain-burner and I can see it will take some time to become competent at.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

This was a game on my "gaming bucket list" that I wanted to play once based on its reputation.  I found the game decent enough, but it's not one that grabbed me.  This game seems to be considered a heavy Euro, and I'd say that is true based more on the wide decision space the game provides than on the complexity of the rules, which is more of a mid-weight in my opinion.

It was certainly my experience in my one play with two other newbies to the game that you need to play this game several times to really know what you are doing in it.  We all made some bad tactical blunders in the game that, with more experience, we may have known to avoid.  That said, I don't know that I enjoyed it enough to give it that kind of attention.

Pros/Cons
+Mechanically solid game without too many rules exceptions.  It has definitely aged well over the last two decades.
+Has some interesting mechanics, like the different colors of victory points and needing to balance them to win.
+Highly skill-based.  The better, more experienced player should win this game most of the time.

=Very cutthroat and confrontational.

-Very thin on theme.  It is a Knizia game after all.
-The combat mechanism of using tiles from hand feels quite random for a strategy game of this type.
-Overstays its welcome.  We finished our game in about 2 hours, which felt too long.

Overall, this is a game that I recognize as being a quality design, but one that just doesn't hold much interest for me.  I'm glad I played it once, but don't know that I'll ever feel the desire to play it again.

Now that I've played this more, I've increased my rating.

- the luck factor is not an issue, the better player will always win, but drawing bad tiles for multiple turns can be frustrating sometimes

The game "feels" like a classic boardgame, such as chess or backgammon, in terms of abstract strategy. On the plus side, it means that the fun is not based on novelty, and should therefore have nearly infinite replayability. The downside is that it can be a little dry and intimidating for some. However, definitely appeals to me, it successfully scales from 2-4 players and I have a challenging, tense game every time! The relative importance of red tiles, and the terrible effect of not having any in hand, can be perceived as a game balance flaw... but not eough to keep me from giving this one a very high rating

Have played a few times now and feel it's too luck driven on what tiles you draw which would be fine if the game was half as long as it is or there was a way to manage being short of one area but the scoring is based on a balance of all colours so being weak in one area cannot be compensated elsewhere, although there are treasures and monuments they are hotly contested.

The obscure nature of what is a "good" action often means that players of different mindsets create odd games where several people think they are taking their best action but its not necessarily true or maybe it is, it's too obscure. Often one or two players get left to their own devices and win or people not paying attention to who needs what colours creates a problem if you don't control someone's weakest area and allow them to run away with the game

The hidden scoring adds to this problem as the colours are taken openly so it's possible to keep track but the game is complex enough that you need to focus on your own strategy quite a lot without enough time to focus on what other players are scoring. It would probably be a better game with open scoring.

Solid strategic fun.  Yes, there's randomness in the blind tile choosing, but it's all where you play them.  Screwing over people is fun here.  The game takes a few plays to get the hang of.  In fact, it wasn't immediately apparent that it would work well as a 2 player game, as one person had a tendency to win by a lot.  But about the 3rd or 4th time we played, it became more even as we explored the strategies.  Yes, the theme is only there to help try and explain the rules, as it's mostly abstract.  

Bump to 10.  After many plays here on the geek, I'd play this at the drop of a hat.  Or a hint.  Or an invitation.  I love this game.

But for a good, thought-filled evening, this will frequently be pulled out.

This is one of the better Eurogames I have ever played.  Granted, I am not a Eurogamer, so take it with a grain of salt, but I have often bemoaned the lack of direct interaction, the lack of randomness, the lack of theme, and the lack of conflict in Euros.  In other words, I like Ameritrash.

This game is not tight thematically, but to its credit, it is not a boring multi-player solitaire puzzle with pre-programmed moves.  The tiles give you randomness and you have conflict.

I have heard some hate this because you are at the mercy of your tile draw.  That is Eurogamer squawking worthy of mockery, as the wargamer in me knows you cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war.  The dice gods love you and the dice gods hate you.  You balance the risk and you take your chances.  That is what makes a game great.  There is an action to dump tiles, so you are not forever screwed.  You play the hand dealt to you.

Bravo, Knizia.  You made a beauty!

Fun area control game, with luck-of-the-draw elements.  Not really grasping strategy yet, but I enjoyed playing.  Making the most of your tile draws seems key, along with knowing when to attack someone else just to set them back.    The four players in this game largely played to raise their own scores and only attack others when it was their own best move, without a lot of catastrophe tokens hitting the board.

Would definitely play again!

Como todo juego de Knizia, primera partida un tanto abstracta y dificil de digerir. No obstante en los últimos momentos ya se veía que este juego da mucho de sí. Mecánicas diferentes a otros juegos y curiosa forma de dilucidar el ganador ya que se mide la victoria solamente por el recurso del que hemos obtenido la menor cantidad. Muy recomendable.

RATING: 5
After four games...  I can see the greatness it this game, but I can also see it's not for everybody - including me.  There is little to no theme, and the play is far from intuitive.  I would play again to accomodate others, but it's one of the only "meaty" games that I don't enjoy.  In it's defense, I can see the appeal for others.  The strategy is definitely high and it is truly a gamer's game - not for the faint of heart.

I have to concede I had this game all wrong. 

There is a barrier to entry - while there are many great PERSONAL reviews, not many are able to really articulate what you need to do to be able to be a competent player. 

However, once you GET it, it really is amazing. I haven't had an epiphany for a while, but T+E really floored me. Effectively, it's a game where there are ten things that are possible, three of them are happening at any one time, and you have to judge how your existing placements and hand composition can take advantage of one or two of them. Learning how quickly dismiss the first five of those things is key - definitely give this game two or three games before judging - it's earned it.

RATING: 7
STRATEGY

Draw and place tiles to build your ancient civilization. Place your leaders and tiles to create conflict. 

This is really an "abstract" heavy thinker's game.  The potential for analysis paralysis is high, as the sheer number of choices, tactics, and strategies a player can use is overwhelming. I think this is a game that will take several repeat plays to begin to fully appreciate the complexity and subtlety.

The manual is a model in clarity.

Some comlain about the tiledraw randomness, but I think that players should base their plans on effectively utilizing what they draw, instead of just hoping to draw something...you have to play the position you are dealt, and make the best of it.  And thats whats so great about it.

This game catches me every time, fairly easy to explain but habits will out.

Another modern classic, a game where you place one of four different coloured tiles or a monument every turn and score points for each. You have four leader matching those colours and you only gain points if a route can be traced to those leaders. If two leaders of the same colour fight it out players can add tile from their hadn to assist the fight. Only one can gain control of a set of tiles. Its quite hard to explain here, and equally hard to teach, but again - your patience is well rewarded by this game.

Trade Info: I have played this copy once. It is the old edition with one sided board and none of the modular expansions. It's a great game, but my copy will never get played and everyone I would play it with owns their own copy.

So, I actually think that Tigris & Euphrates is very much like Samurai, only T&E is more complex and interactive. I can see myself pleasantly enjoying back-to-back games of Samurai and T&E - just need one more strong Knizia game to make it a trio! 

I do find the scoring logic to be much less confusing in T&E, where each player's single lowest number of cubes out of 4 types counts as the end game scoring. The highest amount of the lowest number of cubes is the winner - if there is a tie, then the second lowest number of cubes are compared (with the higher amount going to the winner). 

UPDATE: Played this again and still love it! Even though I did poorly in the beginning while I got used to the rules, I picked up in the end to not lose badly. 2015 UPDATE: I may consider reassessing this game... Haven't played it for years...

Desde que conozco este mundillo siempre me llamó este juego, aunque nunca tuve claro que me fuera a gustar.

Turnos rápidos, miles de opciones, bueno para 2,3 ó 4 jugadores, hora y media como mucho de duración... Es un juego al que no he dejado de jugar en años, y mantengo su puntuación de 9 desde el primer día.

I'm not a big fun of expert of eurogames, but I must say that this one is truly a masterpiece. Original, fun, and engaging on the level of the strategy. I give it a 7.5 instead of 8 because I haven't played it yet with 4 players, when, I'm sure, i will be able to see the whole potential of the game. No dice rolling: the player must calculate his/her movement. Leaders: they are the core of the game. Changing position of one of them in the right moment of the game can change the course of a game!

Blood will flow once more in the Tigris and Euphrates! The rivers will be red, green, blue or black, covered with the remains of the men felled by internal strife and external wars.

 This is a mind blowing game of strategy. A little bit dependent on the draw of the tiles but overall it is very much a strategy game where you have to opportunistic about who you attack, when you attack and how you attack.

Newbs will suffer from headaches for hours afterwards.

I didn't exactly enjoy this when I played on the computer against an AI ... and (with some of the other games I've played against AI) I think I should just stop boardgaming on the computer. This is really just an excellent game. I can understand how important internal conflicts are and how the luck of drawing red tiles can be an issue, but that's minor to me. It's got a constrained decision space (only six tiles in your hand) but it's such a deep game.

I've played this a couple of times now and I am quite impressed.  Unfortunately some of my friends find the game on the difficult side to pick up... much less picking up the strategy.

For 3 players I rate T & E a 9.  I really like how T & E balances out with 3 players.  With 2 players, it seems that an early positional lead is tough to beat.  With 4 players I feel like the game ends a few turns too early.  Maybe my opinion will change, but for now I think I prefer 3 players for T & E.

Az eddigi legjobb játék, amivel találkoztam.
Első ránézésre talán túl bonyolultnak tűnhetnek a szabályok, de néhány játék után rá lehet érezni az ízére. Végtelen számú kombinációs lehetőség, komoly stratégia jellemzik. Újabb és újabb partik szükségesek ahhoz, hogy igazi mélységét megtapasztaljuk.
Vannak akik szerint túlságosan magas a szerencse szerepe a játékban (lapkahúzás a zsákból - vannak akik ezt a zsákból húzást is egy ovis módszernek tartják), de szerintem nem vészes. A változatos, kiszámíthatatlan játékhoz ennyi kell.
Nem nevezhető gyors játéknak. Sőt, "gondolkodós" játékosokkal nagyon hosszúra is nyúlhat. Hármasban a legjobb, de szerintem ketten és négyen is jól játszható.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
A simple map of the Fertile Crescent pitches players against each other as regents and warlords of the Ancient Near East, vying for contol of influence between their Kings, Priests, Farmers, and Merchants. Everyone lays down their tiles and slowly accrues strength in their various leaders, but connecting any one small kingdom to another where like rival leaders are present sparks war. Leaders can infiltrate other kingdoms for political assassination, and multiple treasures can further bolster influence.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
What appears to be a dull, tile-laying semi-abstract game is, in fact, a brutal, clever, and barely-manageable series of Rube Goldberg-esque see-saw mechanisms whereby players want to accrue as many points of influence (VP) by bolstering their leaders, but where a single tile laid can either trigger war, revolution, the erection of great points-spewing monuments, or outright catastrophe. This is a game where everyone at the table feels clever all the time, and you can admire the amazing nuance to each move by way of when to infiltrate your opponents' kingdoms, when to peacefully coexist in their territory with different leaders than are present there, when to build or control monuments--which immediately cripples your related influence strength!--, and when to cloister what little security you have to wait for others to tear each other to pieces. Then, at the game's conclusion, the category of influence in which you have the LOWEST amount is your final score. So much jockeying for position and course-correction. The interpersonal and tactical tension is without boundary. 

Not a Eurogame. Not a Wargame. Not an Abstract. A Masterpiece.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
This is game easily played poorly. "I get points from wars? Let's wage war!" or "I get points from monuments? Let's build monuments!" are easy lines of thinking to indulge, when in isolation, they are disastrous. The balance of this game rests with the players, and it's easy to either misunderstand or disregard that and end up with a landslide win where you didn't expect it.

I managed to get a shrink wrapped Hans Im Gluck version from the German Ebay. I won’t be allowed to play this until Christmas though. I’m wondering how much the the small/large cube exchange and turn order advantage is going to bother me.

After the first play it hasn’t overly impressed me. I can see the potential it has but I think it will take repeated plays with the same competent opponents for it to really shine.

Update: Played a two player game with a friend and this is really starting to shine for me now. I’m raising the rating a touch to reflect this. The player turn order affecting your chances of winning is the only negative I have for this game.

In reality, I have many more plays of this, but I don't log electronic plays.  Classic, amazing, great game.  Elegant mechanics with emergent complexity in gameplay.  Should maybe be a 10, but I'm not convinced that there aren't issues with turn order advantage, a bit too much luck in tile drawing, and too little incentive to build monuments.  But don't get me wrong, even with those reservations, it's still a solid 9.

The only reason I don&#039;t rate this one higher - and make no mistake, I think this game is top notch - is that it&#039;s really tough to teach new players, and hard for them to &quot;see&quot; for a game or two... and, well.. that&#039;s kind of no fun for me.  Especially when they make &quot;mistake&quot; moves that greatly affect gameplay.

The third best euro that I have ever played, right after Caylus and Brass. A very original design.

T & E is a great game.  But like Chess, while I recognize that it's a great game, I don't always enjoy playing it as much as I perhaps should.  I find it a bit "cold" and too abstract for my tastes.  But I still enjoy it every now and then.

A great game -- it's quite simple but it remains very deep.  I really enjoy the scoring mechanic that forces you to play for balance.  More confrontational than most games, which keeps things interesting.

I would rate it higher, but the theme feels a bit pasted-on, and as a more abstract game, the randomness in the tile draws can be frustrating.

i enjoyed my first game of this with 4 players.  i can see the tile draw issues, though, and i'm not sure if it will bug me or not.  i'm inclined to think it won't.  losing conflicts seems so much more harmful with multiple opponents because of how your failed position gets absolutely consumed by the time your turn comes around again.  like through the desert and samurai, i might end up strongly preferring this one with 2 players.

If this an example how Fantasy Flight's Euro Classics line will proceed in the future, I am overjoyed. One of Reiner Knizia's best games, laying tiles and leader pawns and then claiming victory points. Seems simple on the surface, but there is quite a lot to this, and the various revolts and wars you can initiate create a lot of direct player conflict over the scarce victory points. I like the rules for the Monuments, and there are several other variants also included with the box. Components look good, I am happy to finally have this in my possession and it's a classic for a good reason.

I've only played it once, and it was a fair amount of fun.  I think a few more plays will be necessary before I have the interactions down.  I like the idea of your lowest score being your final score; even though it discourages specialization, and I usually hate the inability to specialize in games (Agricola), for some reason it works for me in Tigris and Euphrates.

Edit: A few more plays under my belt, and I can bump T&E a bit.  Because it is very good.

Brilliant game, deservedly a classic. Even after five games, I'm not entirely certain how strong the luck factor affects everything, but it certainly seems quite manageable. However, it's really easy for an inexperienced (or very unlucky?) player to get locked out at a crucial stage, and this can be quite frustrating. Finding a way to turn the game around when it seems you're way behind, is frequently possible, though - and the Knizia-scoring makes you always overestimate how well everyone else is doing.

I finally bought it (thanks to the last Mayfair release). I've only played it a couple of times, but I can say it's much better on the real board game than the almost PBEM here on the Geek. It trully deserves a perfect 10 from me as it has everything I expect of a good game: the right length, the right player interaction and, of course, the right balance between strategy and luck (much more strategy than luck, but still enough luck to make it a game and not a puzzle).

UPDATE: I still like this gam very much, but it's rules can get a little fuzzy from time to time, and it certainly won't appease everyone in a gaming group.

UPDATE: My head hurts if I play seriously, and the only time I tried to play relaxed it just wasn't fun. A greatly designed game, but it's just not that much of a fun game anymore. Down to a 7.5.

After a player understands a few key concepts (kingdoms, conflicts, and scoring) this game seems really quite simple.  

While the mechanics may be easy to understand, the variety of strategies that are available make this game quite a brain-burner.

A single session of T&E is filled with tough choices.  There are so many wonderfully tense situations that will have you wishing for "one more action" each turn.

I also really like the way the landscape can shift dramatically in the course of a turn.  Small kingdoms merge to become sprawling giants and crumble in the wake of titanic battles only to rise from the ashes once more.

Highly recommended.

Nos, nagyon vártam a Knizia legbonyolultabbjaként beharangozott játékot, egyik nagy reménységem volt az előzetes nyomozás alapján. És nem csalódtam benne! Ahogy egy játszma alapján nem szabad temetni egy játékot, úgy az egekbe magasztalni sem illik, most mégis ez utóbbira készülök:)
A játék valóban bonyolult, a komplexitását a szabályok sokasága adja. A finomabb lehetőségekkel együtt egy körben közel 10 lényegesen különböző cselekedetet hajthatunk végre, ráadásul akár kétszer egymás után is. Szerintem a teljesen veszettnek tűnő partiban is lehet kiutat találni, annyi féle a lehetőség. Ha az ellenfél birodalma túl nagyra nő, ketté lehet vágni, ha túl sok épületet épít, akkor meg lehet támadni, mert legyengül. És ha már a támadásnál tartunk: az egyik legkonfrontatívabb játék, amivel valaha játszottam! Persze biztos, lehet egy ideig békésen egymás mellett játszani, de előbb-utóbb betelik a tábla, és muszáj lesz konfliktust generálni. Aki nem szereti a szívatást, az kerülje el ezt a játékot, mert Kniziához képest meglepő módon harciasra sikerült. 
A játék fő kritikájaként azt olvastam, hogy túl absztakt, elvont. Ha valaki olifántokra vár, az biztos csalódni fog, de szerintem nem túl absztarkt.
A területfoglalós típusban, de talán az összes általam ismert játék közül is az egyik legjobb. Egyaránt ösztönöz terjeszkedésre (a kincsek megszerzése csak így lehetséges), építésre (pontok szerzése így hatékonyabb), és konfliktusra (kevés lehetséges épület van, kevés kincs, és az ellenfélnek törvényszerűen van gyenge pontja, szinte lehetetlen mindent egyszerre kivédeni).
Nekem a Pegasus kiadás van meg, amiben szerencsére benne van a 4 civilizációs épület (ez a haladó verzióhoz kell, mi ezt játszottuk). A Ziggurat kieg nincs benne, de azt elvileg az alapkészlettel is lehet játszani.
A játék pontozásáról még nem szóltam: tisztára, mint a Genialban (a leggyengébb pontunk alapján alakul a sorrend, hiába vagyunk összességében fölényesen elsők, attól még lehetünk utolsók a gyenge láncszemünk miatt), csak ebben a játékban nagyobbat üt. Főleg, hogy nem látjuk menet közben egymás pontjait, és vannak joker pontok is.
Jellegében elég nagy hasonlóságot mutat a játék a Reef Encounter-rel, ez utóbbi szerzőjének gyanítom, hogy a Tigris az egyik kedvence... A téma különlegesebb a Reef Encounterben, de szerintem a Tigris a jobb játék, pedig nekem amaz is tetszik. Ha már itt tartunk, ez a legrégebbi lapkalepakolós játék, amit ismerek, majd még nyomozok, volt-e korábban ilyesmi.
A tábla 2 oldala 2 külön pályát tartalmaz, ez plusz pont, viszont a tábla a vágásnál kicsit sérülékenynek tűnik.
Remélem semmit sem hagytam ki, mindenkinek ajánlom a játékot!!
Nagyon szívesen játszom vele, de csak ha pihent vagyok, szabálymagyarázattal együtt 3 óra fölött volt nekünk.
Csak azért sorolom a Caylus és a Power Grid mögé, mert itt nagyobb a szerencse szerepe (a lapkák húzása miatt, bár azok lecserélhetők). Gondolkodtam, hogy az eddig általam legjobban kedvelt Knziza játéknál, az Amun-re-nél jobb-e. Az Amun-re az egyik leginkább egyben lévő játék, amiben minden kis részlet Egyiptomra utal, minden mindennel összefügg, és tele van egyedi mechanizmussal. A Tigrisnek más az erénye: olyan bonyolult, hogy ötletem sincs 1 parti után, van-e nyerő stratégia. Tehát nehéz őket összehasonlítani, most a Tigrisre szavazok.

Haven't played. But love the weight of the box! :)

Told a few friends about it, and even before playing, two of them have ordered it.

Update: Loved my first few games.
Got a brand new copy of this that a friend bought, but since he plays with me, I'm trading his to get him something else he wants.

Update2: I love this game. I'll leave the 9.8 score for now, but it's gonna get a ten if a still like it this much after another 10 plays.
I can't get enough of the blend of risk, thoughtful Chess like placements, the balancing of score, the way opponents can be trying to achieve different things, luck, the non-permanance of everything. Awesome!

Update3: I actually wish I didn't own this, so that I could experience getting it and learning it again. It's so good!!

The first time I played the game it was a 2-player game and someone else was teaching it to me.  Today is the first time I played this as a 4-player game.  I actually enjoyed it even though there is quite a bit direct conflict.  I did not feel like I was getting ganged up on or feeling out of the game if I lost conflicts here and there.  One of the players thought there was a significant advantage for going first.  I am not sure I agree with her.  My biggest worry at the moment are the tile draws and just losing the conflicts.  I am looking forward to playing it more.  I am rating it a 7.5 because I think it is a good game but I am not sure if I should add it to my collection.

RATING: 8.5
I've played this a few times over the years and each time I feel like I learn something new about the game. It's incredibly deep. From a pure game play standpoint, the game is easily an 8 or above. If everyone involved knows the game well, T&E is simply brilliant and tense. 

However, it plays so abstractly that passable strategies are not immediately apparent, and only start developing after you've played a few times. This makes introducing players to Tigris & Euphrates a bit difficult. If you do decide to take the plunge and teach one or two players, those players are likely to need hand-holding throughout the first game or two. Even deciding what to do on your turn is informed by knowing the strategy, so the first couple of games with players new to T&E can be terrible experiences. I rarely choose this as a game to teach for that reason. I'd easily rather teach Vinhos to people than T&E. In view of those drawbacks, the game, despite its brilliance, rarely gets played in its physical form (I do play the app quite regularly, though). These criticisms are similar to lots of heavier games (e.g., see my comments for Brass: Lancashire), but T&E suffers in comparison to those games because of its abstract nature. Also, due to its conflict-based game play, T&E is a much more chaotic experience than other "heavy" strategy games. That chaos may be a plus or a minus for individual players.

It doesn't play great at 2 and is best at 4. If you had a consistent group of 4, you could play this game for years and I expect it would still be fresh. This might be good as a chess replacement for a family of 4 with two intelligent children. However, most of my gaming is done with 2 (kid's way too young) and I don't have the willingness to devote a large chunk of my gaming time to mastering this classic game. 

Update, Sept 2017: OK. This game is some sort of pleasant earwig. I keep thinking about it, even if I haven't played it for a few weeks/months. I'll bump this rating up to better reflect the strength of its design, as opposed to how often I'll play it. If I was rating this solely on its mechanisms, it would be a 9 to 10.

Excellent. Only two actions per turn, and only four (?) types of actions to choose from, but each action has many choices. Heavy interaction between players.  Can be very intense to figure out how to spend your two actions because each play is important.  The scoring method is genius and works so well because of the inter-relation between tile-play, leaders, and the two types of conflicts.  Perhaps most important, the theme of building cities really stands out.  Cities are easy to take externally when they're small, but when they get large the fighting must be internal.

Hard to compare with other games, but I feel that I have more options with T&E than with Puerto Rico. Very difficult to understand the first game or two.  The end conditions and the balance of importance on the artifacts are also brilliant.  Going for artifacts tends to stretch out cities and make them vulnerable to catastrophes and then external conflicts, while making monuments makes cities more valuable while making them weaker against external conflicts.

Playing Tigris is sort of like playing a Gipf game... except that it features a random tile draw and supports up to 4 players.  I also think of Tigris as a gamer's version of Scrabble.  Anyway, I highly enjoy Tigris 50% of the time for it often can get really intense and exciting.  However, Tigris can also turn out to be highly frustrating and dull.  It largely depends on the random tile draw.  I will probably never turn down a game of Tigris for each session has the potential to be an outstanding gaming experience worthy of the BBG Top Ten.  However, I have had plenty of bad sessions in which one player was unable to draw enough Red Tiles in order to stay competitive.

The game is good.  It makes you think through every move and a couple after.  You have the opportunity to plan ahead, but also have to keep an open mind as conflicts can quickly change the face of the game.

The conflicts, monument building and treasures can be confusing at the beginning of the game but after a couple plays everything makes sense.  The end of game scoring makes it necessary to build in all areas of the game as your lowest score is the one that counts towards the win.  

Update: I do only play it on bgg now, but I can't seem to get enough of it and it deserves a near perfect rating.

A game with a fascinating mechanism which takes a while to grasp. Like Lowenherz and El Grande it's quite an abstract shuffling of colored counters across the board.

In the end I found this game too mathematic - as much fun as filling out an excel sheet.

[i]Posted: 1/31/06, Rated: 8[/i]
{2P: 8, 3P: 9, 4P: 7}

I feel like I'm committing some form of BGG heresy by not giving this game a rating of "10."  The reputation that this game enjoys makes learning it seem daunting.  I strongly recommend playing a game or two online, with people that will take the time to explain the basic moves. After your first game, rules that once seemed fidgety melt away, leaving streamlined elegance.

And for the most part, this game is extremely enjoyable.  Somehow the classic Knizia trademark of "too many things to do, too little time to do them" is ever-present, while only having two actions per turn.  It's delightfully agonizing, as I keep wishing for [i]just one more action[/i], that I can never have.  Position play factors in heavily, so playing the board also is important.

However, the luck of the draw also plays a significant factor, and can undo the strongest play.  I've had a virtually impenetrable location undone by someone who drew five tiles of the same color (red), and was able to displace a leader in a crucial position.  The old adage about losing the war for want of a nail could be said about [i]Tigris & Euphrates,[/i] only for the want of a Temple.

[i]Tigris & Euphrates[/i] plays decently with two, shines with three, and is a nerve-wracking madhouse with four.  The starting positions may as well be marked on the board.  It is a wonderful game, and I do enjoy playing it, even if my enthusiasm can be doused by lucky draws.

[i]Updated: 2/7/09, Rated: 9[/i]
{2P: 10, 3P: 9, 4P: 8}

Like a fine wine, [i]Tigris & Euphrates[/i] has gotten better with age and experience.  Side note: the analogy [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wine#Early_history]appears to be appropriate[/url].  After acquiring some perspective on game mechanics by playing many other titles, I was surprised by how refreshingly elegant these rules really are.  My old "complaint" about lacking Temple tiles can be mitigated somewhat through strategic development: provide more support for your leaders while limiting the "attach points" for your opponents.  

An external conflict provides more of a challenge to defend against, since you typically can't be evenly strong in all four colors.  Even if you are building evenly, your opponent can load up in one color to gain an advantage.  Tile draws can still make the difference in any conflict, but that fact adds tension to the game.

I'm now a solid fan of [i]Tigris & Euphrates[/i].  The only reason it doesn't deserve a "10" is that I believe the quality of the gameplay tapers off as more players are added.  Still, I will play this game at every opportunity.

At first glance I was very skeptical to this one. It did take some explaning before I got a soft grasp of the tactics of the game. The goal is to collect as many goods as you can. This can be done by your own production or through hotsile takeovers of nearby kingdoms. The goods have 4 colors and you may only count your score by the color you have least in. This is where the game gets very tactical. You may easily get massive amounts in one color but to win it all you have to have the most divided among them.

By looking at picture or the board it is very difficult to understand how it is played but in short each square you place on the board adjecent to a kingdom with one of your leaders (the wooden circles with symbols) will grant you 1 good of the color of the placed tile. But only.., and this is important, if you have a leader of that color in the chosen kingdom. (Or the black leader which is universal for all colors but red) 

There are exceptions in the rules which makes it hard to play the first time but after having played it once it is quite easy to grasp and play again. The hardest part really is to figure out a good tactic where you stay out of hostile attacks from your enemies but in turn can make hostile attacks on them to have the advantage. 

If given the chance this game will prove fun with your friends and the element of attacks is a big bonus to the gameplay and makes the game a whole lot more interesting but also alot more unpredictable.

This works great even with 3 players which I find is often the poorest number of persons to play in most games for them to stay fun.

Nearly perfect game.  Replayability is the game's strongest selling point; it never seems to get old.

My only issue -- and I fully admit it may be an issue with *me* and not with the game -- is the dreaded "drawing very few red tiles during the game" syndrome.  I guess I'm not smart enough to overcome this hurdle.

Moreover, it took 7-10 games before I could appreciate E&T's gameplay (7-10 losses would be more accurate), but the payoff was definitely worth the effort!

The first time, I played this solo as a 4-player finishing about 4am. Wow. LOVE this game. Yeah, I read all the comments about how abstract this game is, but not how I lived it. Epic rises and falls of civilizations, driven by treachery within, and overrun by those foreigners from afar. C'mon people! Have some imagination!! And I still don't have the deep strategies figured out. The gotcha factor is very nice. I'll play this whenever it comes out on the table. Managed to stretch the brains of our gamer group several times - just need to continue doing that.
Contains the Ziggurat expansion

11/2012: Great core group that likes to play this semi-regularly. Just played this past week in a 3-player and got crushed miserably by a 3-temple juggernaut that cranked out the cubes from a single kingdom - just couldn't get in! What a sad way to see your lead get stomped on during the last part of the game.

Tigris & Euphrates is a slightly odd game. It was apparently designed with its theme in mind, yet is very abstract. It uses colors in a way which forces players to bend their minds a bit. It is a Eurogame, but has no roles, buildings, etc. and quite a lot of direct player interaction. And it is wonderful.

The (very abstracted) gameplay matches the theme very well (obviously not the actions, but the [i]ideas[/i] and the overall picture), as kingdoms rise and fall and different dynasties compete for influence in all sectors of life. The game strikes a very good balance between long-term strategic planning and short-term tactical play. Players can form a vision for what they might want to do with their leaders and kingdoms, but must be flexible in defending against (or initiating!) conflicts with other leaders. The scoring system is very clever and helps balance the game without any artificial mechanisms (e.g., Power Grid), and the game-end conditions allow players some influence over ending the game when it is most advantageous. 

Tigris & Euphrates does a great job of incorporating chance (through the tile draw) but allowing players different ways to mitigate bad luck: a player can build a monument with excess tiles of a single color to gain tiles of a needed color, build up strength in one color in the short term to focus on other colors later (as a short-term deficit in one color means other players are more likely to be gaining points in that color at present, and later in the game they may not compete as strongly for that color [e.g., from monuments]), discard the extras in a conflict (a key strategic point, and the reason the 'English variant' should be avoided), or if necessary use an action to swap tiles. It isn't hard to find games where chance determines a player's fortune. In Tigris & Euphrates, chance influences what a player can (or must) do in the short term, but does not dictate his play. 

More than other recent Eurogames, Tigris and Euphrates allows for concealed plans and subtle play within the rigidly defined structure. Perhaps it comes from the game's spatial nature (something not present in most Eurogames, at least to this extent). It is possible to feint, to build up a kingdom and prepare for conflict, only to move away at the last minute to focus elsewhere. This feels like a game of chess in which a player focuses strength on one area of the board, forcing his opponent to commit more resources to the defense, only to calmly switch his focus elsewhere, knowing that he has gained enough of an advantage by forcing his opponent to react to the threat of conflict, and that the [i]actual[/i] conflict is not necessary. (Perhaps this is overstating it a touch, but still the point stands.)

I recognize that Tigris & Euphrates is a bit too abstract, too confrontational, too dry for some, but I think it is wonderful. The game lacks the thematic feel of other Eurogames (e.g., "I'm a builder this turn!" or "I'm the captain -- all goods aboard!" in Puerto Rico), but in return players are granted great flexibility in playing the game, which can sometimes be lacking in the more thematic games. In my mind, this is a welcome trade-off -- not that I don't enjoy more 'typical' Eurogames (quite the contrary!), but I find Tigris & Euphrates' strengths to be far more than enough compensation for its abstract nature. 

In my mind, this is a modern classic. Simply wonderful. (2012-03)

RATING: 7.5
Excellent Production quality. Get someone to explain the rules first time out to avoid the headache of the written rules. Subsequent games have shown how deep the strategies are with this one.

Without doubt this is a strategic masterpiece with so much scope and flexibility. 4 player game is much faster.

2nd edition adds a new board and new buildings. After one play it seems an excellent addition to a superb game.

Reduced rating to 8.5. The tile distribution can greatly help or hinder you and some games will always be an uphill struggle and never be a contender as a result. It no longer deserves a 9 as a result. 

Time marches on and I become more disenchanted with the fact that the lottery of the tile draw is a factor that you can do nothing to adjust. Most games will have a pivotal swing where a shortage of a specific colour will ruin a players game plan and chances of winning. Telling me that this evens out with multiple plays does not excuse the heavy injection of luck for a game that has never been played twice in the same evening in my experience.

I finally got my first play of this game in and really loved it.  It's a bit mind boggling trying to get a strategy mapped out as the placement and conflict resolution gets a bit much to take on in your first game.  i do look forward to playing this again.

NOTE:  I really enjoyed this game but after 3 years of owning it and only playing my copy once, i figured it was time to send it on its way.  I am sure if i ever find a group to play it with some one else will own it.

A very thinky area control/resource gathering/abstract combat Euro. The scoring in the game is wonderful as it prevents anyone from dominating in one area and forces an even strategy. I could see this score going up with more plays but I'm also not actively looking to play more. The obtuse strategy I think is a little out of my realm of enjoyment. Sits firmly in the "didn't hate it, didn't love it" limbo zone for me.

Wow, what a brain burner of a game T&E is. I absolutely love it! You have to think about so much during your turn that it can make some people's heads ache. Not mine, though. Bring it on! #6 in my top 100 games. I need to start playing this on BGG as it is extremely difficult to teach to new people.

This game is wonderful.  It has an old school feel but an elegance that compares to little else.  I am reminded of Acquire with the grid like board and the combining of different kingdoms, but unlike Acquire you have more control here.  There is the right amount of randomness in the tile draw and the hidden scoring and unique end winning condition makes the game move quickly.  Not too difficult to teach and a few rounds in new players will experience the "click". Excellent

I think this is my favorite sort of "thinking" game after Go.  This, Acquire, and Reef Encounter all share similar mechanics with different tweaks that give each their own flavor.  
  
The civilization theme really does go well with this game, from a historical perspective.  Actually, I'd say that "history of civilization" is the theme here.  The icons, tile types, etc. all follow Campbell's (of Journey of the Hero fame) description of the growth and history of the river valley, right down to temple support of leaders.
  
That said, this game is surprisingly fun on its own terms; not too heavy, while offering various possibilities for strategy.
  
I keep this game around because it's a tile laying game of the type of which I'm fond.  Non-gamers ready to move onto something more complex---or who are already there---seem to like this game a lot.  Growing your cities and civilization, engaging in conflict---civilization video games basically boil down to this goal, and T&E gives you that without getting excessivly complex.  I also like the Knizia scoring mechanic---both through the leaders and through needing to balance out your scores in each color---and I do like the theme.  I prefer the Mayfair version, actually, because of the art on the tiles; fortunately I have the edition without the confusing non-river river bend.

These days, I play Reef Encounter more because I like its nature theme.  If I liked historical themes better, I would play T&E more.  Both games are on equal footing with one another in terms of complexity and thoughtful fun.

Elegant mechanics and beautiful components in an abstract civ building game. Lots of luck in the tile draw but, from what I can tell after only a few plays, it's probably very difficult to beat a more skilled opponent as it all comes down to knowing how to deal with the draw.

Every time I even look at the box, I think about how much of genius Reiner Knizia must be.

I don't know about this one.  This is a decent game with its building/destruction tensions, but it is not the end-all be-all of games.  In short, I think (while it is good) - it is overrated on BGG.

RATING: 7.5
Solid.  Lots of choices, lots of ways to achieve objectives, plays a lot faster than other games with the same richness.  Luck of the tile draw is a small downer, but really doesn't seem to unbalance the game.  Recently downgraded from a 9 due more to my willingness to play rather than any fault with the game.  In this case, read 7.5 as "Very good game. I like to play".

The ultimate tile laying game.  It's Ingenious on Steroids. (okay so they aren't all that similar)  Nonetheless if you are playing the advanced game (you should be) then you are laying tiles and trying to get groups of colors.  Lots of confrontation.  Lots of screwage.  Lots of fun.

Tigris & Euphrates is clearly an excellent game.  It is a heavy thought provoking brain burner.  That being understood, I have very little interest in playing it again.  I can't put my finger on why.  It might have something to do with it being more tactical (as opposed to strategic) than most eurogames.  Maybe it just takes a bigger time/thought investment than I am willing to put into it.  In any event, I am just not motivated to  play it in the same way I am motivated to play other heavy/medium weight eurogames.

Tää jotenkin kiehtoo, mutta en tiä sitte miks. Täs on mukavaa valtataistelua, konfliktia sisällä ja ulkona, ne onki kohokihtia koko pelis. Toistaseks ainakin pidetään arvosana korkeella, vaikka pieniä varauksia jo ilmassa. (17.3.2009)

Unohdetaan ne varaukset. Kyllä tää hyvä peli vaan on. Edelleenkin toki hieman sellanen sekava fiilis siitä, että mikä tässä kiehtoo. Peliä tullut jo pelattua ihan mukava määrä, mutta toisaalta melko harvakseltaan, joten aina täytyy tavallaan kaikki järkeillä alusta. Ei välttämättä huono asia, mutta ehkä pitäis silti pelata useammin, että sais vähä enemmän käryä mahdollisista taktiikoista. (23.3.2010)

See my [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1781368]review[/url] for my full thoughts.

I believe the advanced rules in the new wdition of the game do add some additional elements to the game. A little bit more power to the pacifist strategies and internal conflicts. They add maybe a little more tension to the game.

After debating giving this game a perfect score some things really bother me about it.

-No compensation for late turn order, especially with 4 players. 
-The tile draw can be brutal. I appreciate this luck and see it's importance to the game, but the volatility it creates leaves a little to be desired. So it's essential to what this game is, but somehow limits this game from being a top-notch competitive affair. You can only dump tiles so much before you ruin your score. I think this goes away a bit with more competent and familiar play, but I've seen people "stuck" with a hand (and re-filled hand) of blue tiles with no room to start a new kingdom without getting squished. It seems to be a little rougher when you slammed with blue tiles. You can't use them to build a monument paired with the color you really need if the delta is already established. Also, some of the "boom-boom" plays, the situations where a player causes an external conflict and through a scattering of reinforcements players end up with a monochromatic hand and rape you in the following turn. Like mentioned, good play can minimize the tile draw chaos.
-The last point, among other factors, results in a game more tactical than I'd like.
-The game plays best with 4, but that player count only exacerbates the above 3 problems.

Still it's a game that I'd nearly never turn down. It has a geometric feel to it, almost abstract, that still works well with all the moving parts around it. It's almost elegant and simple enough to give off a "traditional" game vibe- like you could imagine this game having been played for a couple hundred years... well maybe that's a stretch, but compared to modern euro's of the past few years, the game is simple from a structural and mechanical point of view. This was one of the first games I bought back in 2006. Although it didn't hit the table a lot in the beginnings, it's seen fairly heavy table time from about 2010 on and I don't think it's going anywhere. If I could see a log the games played for 2023, I'd be shocked if we weren't still having fun with this one.

Really love this game. Easy to learn basic mechanics. Repercussions of choices and chain reactions is the complex part. Once you understand the ebb and flow of points as the result of external conflicts and how internal conflicts work to set up for external conflicts the decisions can be downright agonizing. Again love it. Setup is a breeze. Another game with a mechanic that will allow one player to hasten the conclusion.

Strategies
Wear your strength on your sleeve and by this I mean bluff if you have to! You want to give your opponents a reason NOT to engage conflict with you until you can beat them. Showing out strength plants doubt about what you may have in your hand.

Try to get your leaders next to as many red tiles as possible, while at the same time prevent engagement of internal conflict by not leaving open red sides for enemy leaders to attach themselves. If you are strong externally and there is no temple to attach to, you can often go untouched and unchallenged, offering more time to increase your strength.

Be careful of engaging external conflict between others. It's fun to do, but all you are doing is giving points to others but not yourself! Only create external conflict between your opponents if removing one of their leaders benefits you and the spoils of victory are small (no more than 2).

A very well designed game, however, I have no emotional attachment, nor do the decisions feel very important.  I think I prefer non-eurogames.

It does encourage "silent play."  Like Chess, for example.  Also similar to Chess, I think it's something most people can enjoy.

However, while it's a good game, I do not typically find myself with a huge drive to play it.  I much prefer games with readily apparent themes.

One play and I can really see how this game has so many options on every turn.  I enjoyed my play, but for my regular game group, that does not tend to enjoy conflict, this game is not a good fit.

Tried this again, four years later, with my brother and my dad.  It really is a super-fantastic game and I've now rated it a 9.  I want to play again!

I dropped the rating to an 8 after play #3.  It was a good round, but I did run away it seems.  I suspect it's a game that just needs more play and probably with a fairly consistent group or players experienced with the game.  I'm not there yet, but that seems like when it will shine most.

Tense and strategic, but luck exerts an unpleasant influence on the game.  I can deal with the randomness of the tile draw, but what's frustrating is that there is almost no way to predict what tiles any player has.  Thus, the conflicts are a crapshoot, which is upsetting because they are responsible for a LOT of the game's scoring.

I'm still not entirely sure I "get" this; so far the tile draw luck is a little much for me, but I concede I'm not good enough yet to develop plans that are robust to bad tile draws, so it might be salvageable.

I'm definitely more willing to play this than the "average" 6.5, to see if it improves as I improve at it.

Works just fine with two players.  It's wonderful with 4.  Tense and confrontational.  As others have said, it's a game where single moves that transform the board are possible.

Top Licence edition.  Same artwork as Hans Im Gluck edition.  Gorgeous, excellent components.  Thick tiles.  I'm very happy I held out for this edition.

RATING: 9.3
How can such a chaotic, tactical game make my brain hurt so much. Like Carcassonne meets Ingenious meets oh so many bits of other good games, yet the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The rules seem complex initially, then there is a brief moment when you realise how simple it actually is to play, then your brain starts to melt with all the choices and the possibilities and the potential to screw your opponents. Oh I just love it.

But forget long term strategy, this is a game of opportunism, parry and riposte. Fortune favours the brave.

This is an amazing 2 player game.  Its a wrestling match - keep your friends close and your enemies closer...

3p and 4p are good too, but more chaotic as you can be attacked several times and wiped out before your turn comes back.

It always amazes me how you can turn a losing position into a victory with a couple good moves and the right tiles.

With 2 equally skilled players, sometimes it can come down to luck depending on who draws the most red tiles.  However make the most of the tiles you draw and you have a good chance to win.

Still one of my favorites - I play online at BGG all the time.

I played it once online, years ago.  Didn't care for it much but then again, I didn't know the rules going into it.  So, I never rated it from that.  I did trade it off as at one time I didn't see where I would actually play the game.

I got to play it and damn, it really did not start clicking until late game.  It's pretty immersive as we all found ourselves wondering whose turn it was as we were all concentrating on future moves.  I'm looking forward to playing this one again to see if it moves up from a seven.

Did I just type the above?  Well, I bumped it back UP to a 7.  I think I want to play this sooner than later.

Nov 2017 - and I did get to play it sooner, knowing how and what I needed to do.  I did manage to win but that isn't what had excited me.  It was the way the game went.  Battling over control of temples, using the blocking tiles, attacking after an attack to prey on a already spent player.  I *really* was into this from the start and now I sorta want to play it again, even sooner.  I think I'll bump it up to a 7.5 now.

Alkatrészek:
A szokásos gyönyörű FFG doboz. Az ember sajnálja kibontani, mert olyan jól néz ki és utána úgyis csak a polckopás jön. Bár bevallom a csillogó dobozokat jobban kedvelem, mint ezt a matt FFG félét.
Amin kiakadtam egy 17 ezer forintos játéknál:
- a paraván minősége. Az egy vicc. Egy szellő elfújja
- a műanyag alkatrészek nevetségesek. Ráadásul faragni kell, hogy összeilleszthető legyen. A színei csúnyák. Totálisan nem ehhez a játékhoz valók.
- Miért nem lehetett a fakockákat fakockáknak hagyni. Most karton tokeneket tettek bele.
- Nem voltak benne műanyag zacskók, pedig szükség van rájuk.
- A belső tárló is egy vicc.
Ami tetszett:
- Benne van a kiegészítő
- A karton alkatrészek grafikai minősége elsőosztályú és a grafikai is tetszetős.
- A tábla kétoldalú
- Elsőosztályú húzózsákot adtak hozzá logóval :)

I only play this on iOS and it feels like it could become my favorite board game.  I am reluctant to buy it though because I think it would be hard to get played with most people I know and it seems like not having the AI do a lot of bookkeeping for you could make the game a lot more frustrating.  Someday I might take the plunge.  I would love to play your copy with you, though.

It must be that there's so much variety of tactical and strategic options, because otherwise the game's not that much to look at.  A game that at first glance looks kind of "eh" but after playing is more "hmm..."

A very interesting game with a unique victory condition. collect a number of victory points in various colours and the one with the most in his least pile wins. this is the only thing that makes the game worth the play. i wish i could get my family to play more so that they would stop getting confused by the game-play but thats the way the cookie crumbles and with the amount of games i get to play i can't complain.

And if you don't play often the game-play is very confusing. internal battle? external battle? what colour cards are we using to fight with? why are you counting the ones on the table? so who fights next? why is my leader coming off the board?  

It is just confusing until you get it nailed!

Tigris & Euphrates is a great game, the combination of different nations' expansion, internal and external conflicts is really great, all in an abstract environment. The winning condition is also brilliant, nobody before thought about this great idea in a game. 

There is some luck in the tiles drawing but not more than , for example, in Brass with the cards. I mean, the best player is going to win 9 of 10 times.

Unfortunately, this game hits the table less than what I really want, that keeps me away for playing dencently, anyway I keep loving it and I'll keep it in my collection.

Knizia's best creation from when he was designing very good games.

More room for clever play and interesting moves than Through the Desert, but this game has seemed somehow more fragile to me.  Odd tile draws or costly battles between two players can often cause the game to end somewhat unsatisfactorily, with one player saying, "Well, I guess I won."

Too much of a gamer's game. I liken it to Chess or other games where many moves are scripted, studied or finely crafted. Takes too long. Prone to analysis paralysis. I'd rather spend my time on a luck-ridden, tactics-heavy dice-fest.

I've only played on iPad so far. I think it's a deeper Carcassonne. Also it's one of the more chess like euro games, where I think someone with a lot of experience would still bowl over other board gamers who are playing for the first few times. I need to play the physical version, but I don't imagine my score going down, maybe up though!

Nearly every gaming friend I have thinks this is a great game. I find the learning curve to be daunting - but now that we finally bought it, I can get more practice on it.

Yes, it's a tile laying game, but there's a lot more to it than Carcasonne. It took me quite a long time to get to grips with the mechanics, but the common Knizia victory point calculation (scoring for your lowest number of collected cubes) hidden behind your player screen makes it hard to follow who is winning. Clever stuff.

I played this a couple of times and liked it enough to want my own copy. Fortunately, the Mayfair Second Edition was released whilst I was on the lookout for T&E, so I snapped it up. 2 sided board and some extra bits - can't be bad!

Interesting tile laying game by the master (RK). Nothing here to complain about or wish had been done differently as regards mechanics, and the scoring of your "weakest" suit to determine winner is a clever twist. I can enjoy the game but (as with many Euros) I find it a somewhat sterile exercise in working the game mechanics. Sure all games end up that way when stripped down to essentials, but games I enjoy more put them in the background and keep their theme foremost in your mind (most CDGs manage this elegantly). This game reminds me of El Grande in the manner by which the mechanics dwarf and indeed totally submerge the theme. I'll play it but seldom suggest it.

RATING: 8.1
Totally cool game!  You can only learn to win by playing.  There is plenty of conflict, enough to rate it as a war game.  This is another of one of the five euro classics I think everyone at sometime should play or own.

This game is about placing tiles to gain control and make victory points. You can create clever balancing engines in the form of temples, that can generate additional VP blocks for your pool.  I think no matter how many times you played it, you would continue to gain new insight to how to win with it.  

It is so unique that it is hard to describe its mechanincs until you have played it.

It plays great with 4 people.

The scoring mechanics are something that it takes playing 3-4 times to get the hang of.

Didn't like it much after the first play but after about 5 I'm starting to like it a lot more- a big grower.

Once it clicks, it's really elegant and I like how conflict heavy it is too.

2009-01-15: Just got it and have been playing a couple of games by myself.  Not sure about it yet...

2013-09-18: In the past four and a half years, I've racked up hundreds of plays on BGG.  I traded my copy because BGG was the only way I ever played it.  Unfortunately, a couple of months ago, BGG closed their online implementation so I've reacquired it.  I've played it a couple of times and it remains my favorite war game.  Don't ever let anyone tell you this is a Euro.  It's a wargame (or to be more precise, conflict simulation) disguised as a Euro. Players can either turtle and hope their civilizations will be left alone or expand and pounce on those monument building, turtling cowards.  Building a strong connected infrastructre is key, but sometimes you just have to take a chance.

I would like to play this one again some time.

Played several times with 2 to 4 players, mostly before I started logging my plays.  This game wasn't hitting the table, so I traded it for Battle Cry.  T&E is a good game, but a lot of the people I introduced it to were confused by it.  Given the opportunity, I would play this game twice a year, at most.  I'm not saying it's poorly designed; it just isn't a good fit for me and the people I game with.

Comprado en la pcra en Dic2010 gracias a un chivatazo de el_mago8.
Hay cuatro tipos de losetas y cada jugador dispone de un lider de cada uno de los cuatro colores. Los líderes solo se pueden poner ortogonalmente adyacentes a las losetas rojas. Cuando se coloca una loseta, se recibe un cubito del color de la loseta si ésta fue colocada en un reino en el que está presente tu líder de ese color. Los grupos de losetas adyacentes conforman reinos. Cuando dos lideres del mismo color coinciden en el mismo reino se produce un conflicto interno. Cuando una loseta provoca que se unan dos reinos se produce un conflicto externo. La partida acaba cuando alguien no puede reponer su mano de seis losetas, o cuando los cubitos comodin (que consigue el líder verde) se reducen a 2 (comienzan 10 en el juego).
Es muy táctico y ofrece muchas posibilidades. El jugador se puede recuperar rapidamente de los contratiempos del juego. Mucha interacción entre jugadores y rejugabilidad infinita. Algunos lo tildan de demansaido cerebral. Un gran juego, sin duda recomendable.

RATING: 9
Challenging! High level of competition for control of kingdoms and monuments creates many opportunities for conflict. There is an element of surprise since it is difficult to anticipate exactly how a kingdom will be configured, with leaders and power, following the placement of a single tile (external conflict). The internal confict move is probably the most difficult of tactical moves - it can use so many temple tiles, yet gain you such a strategic foothold in another kingdom. Poses interesting decisions each turn. Should you really build that monument so early, even though you have the tiles? Other players will want to move into your kingdom, so be careful! In 3-4 player games, all players need to be equal so that an ill-conceived move does not benefit one of the other two players too much. In this respect, can be a bit chaotic if all are not experienced.

Again, another true classic. This is one I really want to like more - but can't...  I'm rotten at strategy games and, while there are some games which are fun to lose at, this one is just painful.  You feel like you're beginning to get somewhere when you get utterly thrashed by that obvious move you completely missed.  This game makes my brain bleed.  I think I'll stick to lighter stuff, please, like  Go  or  Bridge ...

Along with Ra, the best Knizia I have tried so far. The only drawback is that bad moves can greatly affect other players and inadvertently tip the scales. Worth exploring and probably the best tile laying game out there.
---------------------
[April 2012] Rating dropped down as I realized my desire to play this game has waned, even despite purchasing the iPhone app. There are simply too many games I'd rather play instead of T&E.

RATING: 6.5
Rated for the app. I have enjoyed it, but it makes my head hurt, really hard to immerse yourself in this one, which is a bit of a turn off for me. Still, a really epic style Knizia game, which is really interesting to play. If you can grok it, then it's worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A highly tactical game. Lots of strategy with a pinch of luck thrown in. Engaging and brain burning. I particularly like the conflict (internal, external or otherwise). At first, I thought it was abstract but with replay, the subtle themes of kingdom building, war and conflict shine through. Simply a brilliant game from Dr.Knizia.

For a euro, it has an unusual amount of conflict between players. The tension is part of the great fun of this masterpiece. Holds up to replay very well.

We have played with the expansion on the alternate board with the German Pegasus Spiel edition. The expansion does not improve or add to the game, but rather it gives a variant. It's all good; with or without the expansion.

NB approx. once every 12 games, one's tile draw can be so crappy that it 'breaks' that game. Despite this one drawback, it still deserves a 10. 

Update March 2012:
Rating has dropped from 10 to 9.5.
It had been a 10 for 6 years. But now that I've played it 50 times against the iPad AI opponent, I realize how much of this game is luck dependent on tile draw. It's drawing the right tiles at the right time that makes or breaks this game. Sad that it is no longer a 10 for me. But 9.5 still speaks to its quality outside of the small luck element. 

Update September 2017:
T & E is 20 years old but it holds up! Not surprising, since essentially it is an abstract and they have much more longevity than euros. The playtime of 45 to 60 minutes is excellent for a game of this depth and conflict. An added bonus that it scales equally well for 3 or 4 players. A classic game of tactics that will stand the test of time, and not simply because it is old, but because it is that good. 

Still Knizia's opus magnum that he hasn't been able to top himself.

There's the feel of civilizations clashing which is a bit untypical for Knizia. Mechanics are elegant are scoring familiar from several other Knizia games. Better than Samurai but also a bit heavier.

Classic area control game.  Few games have done it better since.  It can feel a little mean at times, so if that isn't your thing, this game probably isn't for you.  But it is usually pretty easy to recover from defeat, and stake your claim someplace else.

I played this game for the first time today, and I find it supperb.  Set yourself up and formulate a winning strategy, and another player can quickly change the dynamics of the board with a single piece at times, making it is a fantastic strategy on the fly game.  The possibilities for points are everywhere, and maximizing them is the fun.  Plus, its a fairly simple game to learn, not too long, and great looking.  Instantly one of my favorite games.  Not given a perfect score because near the end of the game, sometimes people can get stuck if they have not used some of their pieces to the perfect advantage and luck can be a definate factor.

Love so many things about it - win condition of "weakest" point category, the theme, how crowded the board gets and inciting war between players, the fact that you can't know if you're going to win b/c of the player screens, hidding scoring so you're not suuuure if you're going to win or not, simplicity of your actions (do two things) but depth of choices, quick turns and everybody's engaged - so much to love!

This is a joy, every game plays differently. This game has everything, every move you make feels important, yet you never feel like you are out of it or clearly going to win, it keeps you on your toes, most games play around one hour mark, you will immediately want to play again.  I have a feeling after more plays this will be a 10!

I was so excited to finally get this, then incredibly disappointed.  There is NO theme - just a pretence of one - and it seemed too hard to get our heads around what should be our strategy.  Maybe with more plays it would have become clearer, but we gave up after 3 and then I sold it.

A Knizia masterpiece.

The available moves are simple and straightforward (place a tile, move a leader, discard and redraw tiles), but the complexity of the interactions between them is staggering.

One fellow BGG member (whose name I forget) noted that T&E is excellent for encouraging creative play. I concur. There are always multiple paths to victory, and even the most well-fortified kingdoms can be toppled through clever use of internal/external conflicts.

Un clásico pero descubierto hace muy poco. Lo he probado a 3 y 4 jugadores y funciona muy bien. El tema de manejar CONFLICTOS INTERNOS y EXTERNOS hacen muy díficil que alguien se haga muy fuerte lo cual te hace estar siempre en riesgo. La mecánica es sencilla pero el juego es muy profundo (que más se puede pedir a un euro). Algo de azar pero aceptable. El modo de puntuación hace que dominar un campo no sea definitivo. Tengo ganas de probar la expansión para tener una visión completa. Ahora mismo es un juego al que quiero volver a jugar.

1/29/05 - Rules are relatively straight forward...yes...the internal/external conflicts created a little...uhm...conflict in a few peoples minds at first but constant explanation smoothed things over and they didn't have a problem after the third time through. Game play is exciting (at least it is with the people I play with). Having the right tiles at the right time is key to achieving the victory cubes you need. Having the balanced approach for victory...to me...is simply brilliant! Requires equally skilled players which becomes difficult since the game lends itself to the more brainiac type player. Still a great game and, so far, always willing to play.

The rare instance where I DON'T like a mulitplayer game with a two person variant.  The consensus on the 'geek seemed to be "works good for two," so I picked it up.  It's not bad, but in our experience, you had to force conflict or really it rarely happened.  Usually once in the late game, and so everything was a buildup to a single big event.  The game often ended by collecting treasure before that point, though.  The board is just two big for two, even after we restricted the corners.  Not horrible, and I can see how with more it would be good, but it just never made it to the table much.  Sold.

I am becoming not so much a fan of Knizia anymore, but this is my favorite game of his. It's very confrontational but doesn't feel vicious, and allows you many chances to take back what was stolen from you. I do feel that there can be a runaway leader problem, especially once two or three monuments have been laid, but really an excellent, brain-burning strategy game.

Everything that is wonderful, and everything that is terrible about German games in one box.  Wonderful = deep strategy, wonderful and clean design, superior components and art, simple rules.  Terrible = themeless, mathematical, and I will never be able to tell a good story about a game of T&E.  I really like it, but there's a crucial part that's missing, and that part is the theme that makes the game tell a story.  At the end of the game, I hadn't experienced the thrill of developing the land around the Rivers, I had nstead engaged in a mathematical exercise with a spatial component.  Maybe I'm just getting old.

This has only hit the table twice in the year that I have had it. Neither game was very enjoyable. I want to give it another try. I think I might have introduced it to the wrong gaming group. It is so well liked by others that there must be something I am missing, but so far I'm not sure what it is. The problem is my gaming group is so far enjoying Caylus and Puerto Rico that I am unlikely to get this on the table anytime soon. 

[updated] - Changed rating from a 6 to a 8. I played the game a few times with a new group of people and it was much more fun with this group of people. Can't wait to try it out some more. It has the most direct conflict of any Eurogame I own which is a plus. Supporting up to 4 players only makes it hard to get out.

RATING: 6
It's an OK game, but I just don't see what all the fuss is about. You play the tiles you have or swap them out either if they're all bad or you want to drive the game to a quick end. Try to keep your victory points balanced, and protect your interests when it matters, but keep in mind that the positions of your rulers really doesn't matter all that much until you're connected to a temple and raking in bonus cubes. Don't get too attached to any particular color of tile, *especially* red tiles, and be quick to move elsewhere when local returns diminish. Tactics aren't particularly straightforward, but they're no brain burner, for sure.

RATING: 7
For a Knizia game, T&E has some tough and fiddly rules. We had a hard time remembering which tiles are useful for which conflicts. And there are also different rules for determining the initial support that your leader has. But there is an amazing ebb-and-flow to the game, and a beautiful mix of luck (from the tile draw -- wonderful tension when you attack, not knowing if you can succeed) and skill (from placements, shoring up your leaders' support, etc.).

One major problem with the 2p game is that sheer luck can lead one player to dominate by having her players take over an entire kingdom, banishing the other player's leaders. Once that happens, the other player is sunk -- he might as well concede. Otherwise he loses by embarrassing margins. (I say this from bitter experience.)

Quite a game this - real brain buster for me.  Although I enkoy it I've never quite grokked it, by which I mean I can follow the rules but don't have an instinctive feel for how the game develops once you get into conflicts.  I suspect that problem could be solved by more plays and look forward to that.

This game has two notable negatives for me: thin theme and highly abstract gameplay.  Thus, it's an excellent example of how objective factors can't be used to compute a rating for a game.  If I were to rate all of the individual pieces of this game and put them together, it would get a pretty mediocre rating.  But instead, it's the only game in my collection that I will instantly agree to play, will play over and over again, and never get tired of.  I've started to get a bit tired of Puerto Rico, but have never gotten tired of this.  And I've been playing T&E longer.

I've been playing the new Pegasus version, and it's interesting how much the variant board changes the game. I didn't think it would make that much difference, really, but it did produce a game with a very different feel to it.

The little mini-monuments, on the other hand, seemed rather awkward (especially thematically) and like they didn't add much to the game at all.

Funny that playing the new edition of T&E has caused me to re-evaluate my rating, and kick it up to a 10. Not sure if I just had become burned out and needed a break, and now it's back, or what. It does seem that there is a class of Knizia games that are so intense and pack so much game into a small-ish package that they can easily be over-played. For me, T&E, Blue Moon, and Beowulf all fall into this category - I love them all, and consider them some of the best games ever made, but wouldn't want to play them every week, just because they're so involving that after playing it you need to step back and play something lighter, like a Settlers or something.

Is the new edition worth it if you already have one of the previous editions? Probably not, given the cost of importing it. But as a game collector, the new map has enough of a different play feel, and the aesthetic of the game is quite different from either the Mayfair or the Hans im GlÃ¼ck version, and I'm happy to own it (I own all three versions now). It's probably the least graphically effective of the three editions, in my opinion - although most people I know like the Mayfair version less than I do - but I still do like the richer colors and more evocative tiles.
---
Interestingly, this game has not quite achieved the greatness that seemed it's destiny when first released. Obviously, we're talking degrees of greatness - it's a very, very good game - but it doesn't seem to go "over the top". I think it's because the luck element (in the form of the tile draws) is just a little bit too heavy, and there is far too much potential for a mistake by one player to hose or massively benefit an uninvolved third party (this is an attribute of many games which don't suffer for it; but it's evidenced too much in this game). Still a very fine game which is highly recommended, but just misses my top-10 all time list.

T&E deserves a place in the boardgaming hall of fame, if one is ever built.  For players who enjoy deep strategy, T&E can be dangerously addictive.  The frustration level in this game can reach the boiling point, and it takes some time to explain the rules.  That's why I've given this game a 9 and not a 10.  However, when I get a group of serious gamers together, this is the box that we pull off the shelf.  It has an almost mythical status, and I salute Reiner Knizia for offering yet another profound board gaming experience.

Long term plans mean nothing in this one because the board dynamic changes so quickly.  But it makes it all the more sweet when you can adapt to those changes and slap your opponents down with your clever thinking.  I learn something new every time I play. Can't wait to bring it out again.

I've just recently downgraded this from a 10 to a 9.  I still really like it...it's just that there are games that I'd pick over this right now.

RATING: 8
Overall I find T&E fascinating, elegant, and excellent in terms of interaction.  This is due to a design that uses simple mechanisms and few action choices but one that allows for numerous tile placement possibilities.   Unfortunately some eurogamers today don't have much interest in T&E and maybe this is because of the emphasis on tactical and luck factors over pure engine-building strategy, the degree of abstraction in the theme, the nature of it having direct conflict, and perhaps some confusion with the rules and tactics on first play. After awhile things seem to devolve into tactical prowess, chaos, and plain-old fashioned luck (especially with more players).  Losses in war can have a huge impact on things and the winner can gain a huge boost in points.  Most Games end pretty close in scoring due to the scoring in the area that you have the fewest points in.    I really like how this forces you to balance out your approach and it can create more likelihood for conflict.  I found that Playing 3-4 player is the best while at 2 players i could find better games to play.  I also like that Players are not supposed to know exactly how well their opponents are doing leaving an element of mystery in the final scoring.  It is one of those games where it can be hard to see the board at first with all the options available.  A novice will often not be able to take advantage of the opportunities that an experienced opponent notices.   Though I wish the wooden leaders were kept somehow, I really like the updated FFG artwork and tile components that really spice up the look and feel of the original.  Overall a very good game that everyone should play.

Updated 5/27/10.

Only two games under my belt, so take the rating with a HUGE grain of salt.  I usually don't rate a game this early, but I felt like I had a pretty strong grasp of the mechanics and preliminary strategy.  For some reason, this one was just sort of intuitive. 

As an abstract tile-laying game that is quite different that most anything I've played, I really enjoy the experience of playing T&E.  The gameplay itself has a lot of tough choices and interesting chain reactions that take some foresight and careful planning to benefit from.  Most importantly, the game mandates interaction.  It's a game of positioning, akin to a chess match, and for some reason one of my personal favorite sensations in all of boardgaming is the jab-counter-jab-block-feint-counter back-and-forth of matching wits with a talented opponent in a game such as this.  (I'm terrible at chess and generally hate abstracts, however, lest the chess comment turn you off to T&E.  This is a whole different animal.)  

I would have preferred a more attractive board and bits (something about the artwork didn't resonate with me) and I struggled with the lack of theme (I just wanted SOME explanation for what the VPs are and how they related to each piece on the board).  I'm not sure my gaming group got the same experience out of it that I did and so I can't really see myself pulling it off the shelf that often.  If someone else wanted to play, however, I'm confident I'd have a great time.

Initial thoughts after only 1 playing (btw Luke very expertly explained the rules, thanks).  Although I see some advantages of the "least color scores" idea, I feel it produces anti-climactic games to say the least.  Players must address their weaknesses instead of taking advantage of the strengths.  For example let's say you had this in an American Civil War game.  The South would be compelled to give up making use of their more experienced troops or better leaders, and instead just do all they could to build up their limited manpower, knowing all along this was unlikely to lead to victory (because by definition this is where they are weak, and is extremely boring also).  Similarly, the Union would not have time to make much use of their naval ability or great manpower, instead they should establish an officer's school, and maybe invade Canada to give them some experience.  In other words, working on your weakness (probably in a tangential way to the main action) instead of your strengths is no so much fun, imho.

Dec 2006: 
The crème de la crème of German games together with El Grande, Puerto Rico and IMO In the Shadow of the Emperor. Knizia's masterpiece (as is widely acknowledged).

Funny though that Knizia's prone to copy himself. One of his 2004 releases, Einfach Genial!, seems to me to be the little brother of E&T. Simpler rules and abstract. I played that game before discovering E&T. 

IMO. The mechanics reflect the theme in many ways. That said, I maintain the same about El Grande. Indeed, I find it sad some claim its theme is pasted on. It's IMO a very elegant "German" treatment of the rise and fall of Mesopotamian city states - meaning it captures the essence that topic rather than being a history lesson (American-style games offer you that sort of experience). Quite frankly, I believe those calling it weakly themed just don't get it. Nasty me. :p

Dry Euros aren't my favorite but I love the depth of this one.  Been playing it a ton on the iPad (my plays recorded for this are only real life plays) and digging the way the strategy unfolds as you peel back each layer.

RATING: 9
Only played a couple of two players games because unfortunately my girlfriend didn't care for it as much as I did, nor did one of the members of my game group. However, I came away from my first two plays thinking that it's now my favorite Knizia after Modern Art. Could be a 10 if I ever get to play it more.

UPDATE: After more plays, I still like it quite a bit but I don't see it climbing in ratings as I originally thought it might. This is mostly because it's too dependent on the luck of the draw, overwhelming most long term planning. Still, it's a solid game that I'm more than happy to play. I still need to play it more, especially with 3 and 4 players before I can really judge it.

UPDATE: Played several more games with 2, 3, and 4 players. It works with any number of players and the luck of the tile draw doesn't detract from the game like I thought it would. There's a lot of depth and replayability here for the given complexity and playing time. Boosting my rating to a 9.

RATING: 9
High player interaction. Sufficiently complex to require intuition. A very good game. Very aggressive too, so it's a nice contrast as compared to more indirect games like Puerto Rico. Furthermore the mechanism enabling a player to spark a war between two other players can be fun!

It plays reasonably fast (60-120, leaning towards 80min) and the theme fits good enough if one accepts that each player controls a dynasty of nobles that are spread out among several neighboring kingdoms, rather than a particular nation itself. (Think of european noble houses, which controlled several nations and even had wars amongst themselves.)

BIGGEST DRAWBACKS: Turn-order matters, less as in Puerto Rico though. Generally you are safe against your right-hand neighbor and prone to your left-hand neighbor in conflicts sparked by third parties. Medium to low luck influence. Starting player seems to have a competitive edge over later players.

Not suitable for players which are prone to analysis-paralysis and want to compute every little detail.

Double sided board edition. 

I need a lot more plays to be halfway decent at this game. But from what I've played, it is incredibly deep in strategy, offers a wealth of different paths to take, and contrary to what most say, feels quite thematic to me. 

I feel the luck of drawing tiles holds it back from being a 9, although it is well mitigated. It just feels like you could get shafted for a number of turns before drawing what you need to carry out your strategy. And this isn't as reactive a game as, say, Neuroshima Hex to excuse it. At it's heart, it's an engine building game, with area control layered heavily on top of it.

Knizia might be an egotist, but his games are winning me over. Well done.

RATING: 10
It is hard to define what is great about this game. Even though I believe this game to be great.

The battle to figure out how to turn your random tile draws into a balanced assortment of points, is definitely something that is exciting. The battle to start wars between your opponents that devastate their positions, leaving you with an in is fantastic and gives you opportunities for beautiful plays. Putting your opponents in lose lose situations is great. Sacrificing a battle for side benefits is certainly clever.

The problem is the game gives you so much with so little. So many possibilities during play for surprising inventive creative play, with a rule set that is spartan compared to games that get released today. I lack the vocabulary to properly explain why T&E is such an incredible game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It seem fairly strategically and tactically rich, but it just kinda bores me. As abstract as abstract comes, and as such, the rules are overdone and too unintuitive to compete with the truly brilliant and elegant abstracts (Go, Chess, Backgammon, even the Gipf series), while the utter themelessness (I'm not buying any of this nonsense about it 'feeling' like the rise and fall of Civs--bullshit) makes it pretty poor competition for other mid/high complexity Euros for me. To me, it never felt like anything more than a totally abstract cube-management exercise, and I like cube-management exercises, at least at a less-complex, or better-themed level. Dry, dry, bone dry and too little control for something that is supposedly 'deep'. I really don't see the appeal. Traded

UPDATE

All that said, I'd like to play it some more because I'm starting to realize that Knizia's games often take a few more plays to really shine. I'm staying open-minded in the hopes of playing again.

Based on 1 play with 2 players: I bought this and Reef Encounter on the same day... I didn't realize they were quite so similar! Reef Encounter (based on first impressions) seems a little more interesting (and has less luck) but T&E has it beat in simplicity and elegance. Simple rules, good amount of strategy. I definitely need to play it again. We played with two players... and it seems like it would be really difficult to catch up if you fell behind with more players (especially 4). I'll have to try it with more sometime. I think I'd like this a lot more if I could play it with some regularity.

E&amp;T has so often been praised that the first time you play it you may find it a bit dissapointing (Too complex, too long  and too chaotic) but soon you will discover that the rules are quite intuitive, that you can build complex tactics, that you should look carefuly after your opponents moves, keep and eye on your resources, manages your civilisation tiles and your chiefs moves... At that moment, you must admit that E&amp;T is a great game with a very subtle and balanced mechanism (but may be reserved to hard core gamers).

[u]July 2008:[/u] I think I played a lot too many games with this one. Sure it is a good game, but far from one of my favorites. The reason it got so much plays is that it was the only short enough for us to play when it was getting late (and so play it we did!).

[u]July 09:[/u] As usual when I am thinking about getting rid of a game, I ask my fellow gamers what they think about it, well it appears that they were all in favour of keeping it as they all love it pretty much.

Absolutely wonderful for the amount of game that's contained in the comparatively simple rules. A game of postures and jabs, allowing for players to express themselves through the mechanics.

RATING: 8.5
A great older game which I've unfortunately sold (one of my highest rated "previously owned" games - and I've only sold it as it's so hard to get to the table and it's almost only liked by me and my wife). When  played by just 2 players the game doesn't really work too well, and I vastly prefer it with 3 and 4 players! With 3 players, two of them can fight against each other while the last player can play his own game... Well, it isn't entirely true in this game as it's chaotic and there are lots of interaction, but you get the point. With 4 players, everybody are involved all the time and there will not be much free space to build on, so there will be lots of internal and external conflicts - excellent!

I think it is a pretty good game even though it's so old. I like that you can only do 2 things on your turn, which can be chosen from a few different actions, but there's always more than 2 things you want to do on your turn! To me, that's one of the signs of a great game. Also, it's a rather aggressive euro which is definitely not multiplayer solitaire and I like that for a change from the less confrontatial euro games which we have to admit form the vast majority... Oh, and the scoring mechanism is ingenious (!). Highly recommended!

I finally got to play this game, after having owned it for nearly a year.  And a most excellent game at that.  Very tight in its design, and relatively easy to play once you get the mechanics of internal vs. external battles.  

Winning mechanism is similar to Knizia's [gameid=9674].

Edit:  After 2 real-life plays, and another on GTO, I am finding myself additcted to this game, and I want to play it again, and again, and again.

RATING: 9.5
Definitely a game that grows on you with gameplays. I'm still trying to work out the kinks with teaching this game - it's a very steep learning curve, but well worth it. No matter how clear you are with teaching, I think it takes a full gameplay before people really understand it. Also, with the enormous amount of possible moves at the beginning, new players often feel overwhelmed.

That said, I immediately noticed that since each player gets 2 moves on their turn, this game would take to couples/team play very easily. We tried it with three couples (two of the three couples being new players) and discovered that this is the ultimate way to teach the game - The couples immediately took to quietly discussing strategy and correcting each other on the rules during other people's turns. Fab game.. Tips I agree with: Definitely don't think you own anything on the board. Be extraordinarily flexible in your leader placement as to your needs. Play for the immediate point scores until you can learn to see further into the game. I'll start it at a 9 and expect it goes up. Thanks Santa!

[i]Update April 2007[/i] - The more I play the more depth I see. This is a fantastic game! As with Puerto Rico, I've put it at 9.5 now and the only reason it stays just below the mark is because it doesn't come out to play as often as I'd like.

RATING: 6
Strangely popular here on the Geek, given that the characteristics of T&E closely mirror those of unfashionable old American games such as Risk, albeit with some counterintuitive rules complexity added.  If you're the type of player who enjoys it when a roll of the die or a lucky run of tiles turns the game upside down, you may like this.  Planners won't enjoy it; gamblers will.  No one can safely avoid conflicts, because six tiles isn't enough to defend all of one's scoring sources.  The conflict outcomes are determined mostly by blind guessing and luck; if you make the rational play but your opponent happens to hold the tiles to defeat it, you're sunk.  Similarly, you're always vulnerable to one attack or the other, so if the attack is the one you can't defend, you're in trouble.  Only for those who don't mind seeing their best-laid plans constantly disrupted by Dame Fortune.

I have played twice now.  Very intriguing game.  Can be a little frustrating with certain tile draws, but I'm still learning how to deal with those.  One of the few games that I could see rising to a 10 for me.  The replayability appears to be extremely high.

Wow. My head hurts. What an unusual game. T&E is the first game that makes me feel like I'm "a real gamer." I can't imagine what my reaction would be if this was the first Euro that I was introduced to.

This game makes my head spin because it inverts a lot of game conventions (i.e. "I'm this color." "This is my area, not yours.") The first game was jarring in that regard, but I'm looking forward to learning this game to the point where we all play smoothly with familiarity. 

Update: five plays, and this is still a solid 8. With each play, I find myself trying new tactics, and responding to the new tactics of my fellow gamer friends. There's a ton of depth packed into a game that lasts a very reasonable length of time. I can easily see myself revisiting this game off and on for the foreseeable future. My only knock on the game is that I don't see the theme like some others do, but the gameplay is so rich that I don't care.

First thoughts based on one play (and it was a two player): 
Looks like the usual strategy games I like, but it's really an abstract game and I'm not fond of abstract games.  The theme seems extraneous to gameplay, bland, and not very engaging. Also I didn't like the artwork.  Reading through the rules was brutal as they are terribly written  and by the time we started to play we still had only a vague idea of what our goal was or even how a turn should play out.  

On a positive note, I started to enjoy the game about halfway through as I began to develop my strategy and a better understanding of the game. I would definitely be interested in playing again.  (Unfortunately, my gaming buddies don't feel the same way...)

RATING: 5
This is one of those games where I can see what both the people who like it, and hate it, see in the game.  It fits soundly in a category I refer to as Quasi abstract.  Not a true abstract as the random tile draws can make a significant difference.  And yet, not a richly themed or immersive experience.

Think chess, if the pieces were randomly drawn from a bag.

I have never liked the game per se, and I now find it gathering dust on the shelf.

Still I recommend everyone try it, it deserves to be in the top 25 games.  I'm just not sure if it should be in the top 10.

Addendum: Traded away and have never missed.

High learning curve but well worth the effort.  Great game that is different every time and full of tense moments.  It takes a few games for the strategy to become clear but when it does...wow.  Clever game!  There is a lot of room for sly tactics that can rob another of his lofty position.  And I just love the way the board changes and evolves as the game unfolds.  Place one tile here and...bam...the power shifts and the board is different.  You can plan your next turn...but the player prior to you takes his turn, and now your great plan is not even possible.  Plays great with 2,3 or 4 players - although a much different feel with each level of play.

But I enjoyed the first tense play and look forward to getting this on the table with gamers that I know will appreciate it.

I can see why this is compared to reef encounter so often, but I think I prefer reef encounter to this.  And here are the reasons why.
1)  The non-random tile selection in reef encounter seems a bit more in my wheelhouse then the draw some tiles from a bag mechanism in T&E
2)  Both games limit the number of actions you can take, however, reef encounter's cyclical produce/consume cycles just feels to me like it allows for more clever moves and a bit more strategic planning than your 2 actions in T&E
It might sound like I am bagging on T&E, but that is not the case.  Both this game and Reef Encounter provide (for me) a very abstracted yet thematic experience of waxing and waning.  Both games have interesting player controlled timers that allow players to control the tempo of the game.  What I like about T&E is the ability to control areas at two different levels (internal or external revolts) which allows its own interesting strategic planning.  It also allows players with different tile distributions to try to attack their enemies in two distinct ways.

Overall this is a very very good game, but if I had to choose one, I think I would take Reef Encounter over this one.

Knizia's best design ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
There are a couple learning curves with this game. First is just getting the gyst of the rules. Then, there is learning how to identify and build positions of strength....both internally with temple support and externally with same-color followers. I find beginners too tied to having red tiles and not knowing what to do when they don't draw as many as they'd like.

There is a bit of luck to the tile draw, but I find that the more skillful player usually will win regardless of the tile distribution. The faster you are cycling through your tiles (and USING them, not exchanging them) the better your chances are of doing well. Your hand is your hidden information. You want to build disparities of colors to have surprising strength in a color, then attack or better, sucker someone else into attacking you. If you don't have a color you want, consume the other colors in conflict and draw a new hand that way. 

Tigris and Euphrates has a timeless feel to it which makes me think its really centuries old. In my opinion, this is Knizia's biggest masterpiece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another great Knizia design that seems to just make sense once you play it. I wish there was a way to minimize the red tile problem, but if you can live with it this game is imminently rewarding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Euphrat & Tigris is Knizia's tile laying magnum opus.

Players each control a faction with leaders in 4 colours, corresponding to the 4 tile types. On their turn, they place leaders onto the board, place tiles from their hand of 6, and can also ditch tiles from their hand and redraw if there is something particular they need. Each time a tile is placed on the board, a victory point cube in that colour is given to the player who has that coloured leader present in that cluster of orthogonally adjacent tiles (which are called a "kingdom" in game lingo).

Everything is fine and dandy until two leaders of the same colour end up in the same kingdom. This can lead to a revolution (if the conflict was caused by a leader piece being placed into a kingdom that already had a leader of that colour present) or to a war (if the conflict was caused by placing a tile that joined two kingdoms with leaders of the same colour present). Revolutions are simple: the two leaders count up the number of red tiles they are orthogonally adjacent to, and can also throw extra red tiles from their supply of 6. Loser removes his leader, winner gets a red VP cube (regardless of the colour of the leader removed). Wars are much more complex and are where the game is generally won and lost. Wars involve checking the number of tiles present in the entire kingdom that match the leader's colour (i.e.: conflict between two blue leaders, one has 2 blue tiles in his kingdom, the other has 4) and then throwing tiles of that colour in support. Loser has to pick up his leader and all of the tiles of that colour from his kingdom. Winner scores VPs in that colour equal to the sum of the tiles +1. Wars can lead to multiple conflicts depending on how they play out, which can create avalanches of point scoring.

The other way points can be scored efficiently is by building monuments. When 4 tiles are placed in a square, the player placing the 4th tile can opt to flip them over and place a monument on top. There are monuments in each two colour combination, and the one placed on the tiles has to have the colour of those tiles present as one of its colours. Monuments sit on the board permanently from there on out, and if you have a leader connected to it at the end of your turn, you score a VP cube of that colour. This is very efficient, and as a result, monuments are generally fought over viciously once they are constructed.

The end game scoring is based on having sets of the 4 coloured cubes, a Knizia staple. Hence, balance is required to win.

Euphrat is justifiably known as a classic in the Knizia catalogue at this point. It's a deceptively simple game rules-wise, but has a lot of subtlety in the board play, particularly in setting up for advantageous wars, which is where the game is usually won and lost. This is a game that tends to create apathy for the first play or so, but it seems to gain a shine as players gain more familiarity with it and as the nuances of play open up more. I wish Knizia still designed games like this.

An excellent game I have enjoyed many times and taught to players at conventions.  Make no mistake - this is a game of drawing tiles and using them to get ahead.  Draw bad tiles, get bad score.

Knizia's masterpiece.  This is truly one of the "great" games, even if it is at first somewhat less accessible than something like Settlers.  Excellent, hardcore strategy that just gets better and deeper every time you play it, unlike most Euros that have a play threshold of about three times.  Everything about this game has a classical feel, which makes it a touch academic and maybe a bit cold, but it's a great game with tension, conflict, and tough decisions that are completely at odds with what most Eurogamers hold dear.

Build an empire starting from scratch, and when it falls, invade someone elses. This game is amazing! So much to do on your turn, but not enough actions to do it all. It is all about prioritizing, while finding your enemies weakness, and exploiting them. Trust me, they will have them, and so will you. It is a constant struggle to keep everything balanced. And just when you think you are taking the lead, you remember, It isnt the person with the highest score that wins, it is the person whose lowest score is not the lowest! Give the game a try. My only complaint is that the tile picking bag is a little bit see-through.

I played this today at lunch for the first time to learn the rules, with two players.  Wow!  I was getting kicked as my opponent scanned the rules for sneaky plays he could make while I layed down tiles and slowly collected cubes.  The monuments started spewing out cubes galore and I thought I was sunk, until near the end of the game I intuitively (i.e. luckily) connected the two giant kingdoms that had formed which spawned a number of conflicts, all of which I won.  I think the final score was 17-12.  I can see how this game would be even better with 3/4.  I still have a post-game buzz from playing.  The last game that did this for me was Age of Steam.

There are complaints out there about the luck of the red tiles, but what people don't consider is that: A) red tiles are the most prevalent of the four colors, and B) you have to score in all colors not just red.  I will never, ever turn down a game of T&E!

2009-ben az első benyomások mérsékelten pozitívak. Érdekes, hogy ez nem egy stratégiai, inkább taktikai játék, ahol mindig adott helyzet alapján kell gondolkozni, nem egy előre kitervelt stratégiát végigvinni, pont ezért viszont nagyon agyalós.

Azoknak ajánlom akik akár 1-2 órát is tudnak csendesen a helyükön ülni és gondolkozni, mi lenne a lehető legjobb döntés. :)

Ma, 2010. október 21-én ismét elővettük és most már sokkal jobban tetszett! Ha ki tudjuk próbálni 3-4 személlyel is, szerintem nőni fog a jelenlegi pontszáma tovább! :)

Hátránya a zsákból húzgálás. Hiába jó a taktikám, ezt simán üti az, ha nem jó lapkákat húzok...

Azóta többször játszottunk vele, 3-4-en is. És nagyon jó játéknak tartom. De sajnos száraznak is, így hiába szeretem, megválunk tőle.

Játszási szám: ~10

Végül az eladás sorsára jutott, talán eddig ettől szabadultam meg a legnehezebben, mert hiába tartom én is nagyon komplex, jó és értékes játéknak, ha a száraz és igen agyégető játékmenet miatt nagyon ritkán kerül elő...

This game is deceptively simplistic.  There are only a few choices for things a player can do each turn.  And yet, each choice you make is crucial and can turn the game in another direction.  It is critical to keep your leaders balanced since your score is only as good as your worst leader.  

Only plays are with 2.  I imagine there's much more interaction with >2.

Probably Reiner Knizia's best game.  Three or more players is recommended.  Almost an abstract stragegy game, since the civilization theme is really just barely pasted on.  Feels a bit like a wargame at times since in order to win it is necessary to "attack" other players.  This game is not as difficult to learn as it would appear to be.  The gameplay contains Knizia's typical extreme depth within simplicity of mechanics(not as simple as Samurai) and perfect balance between randomness and strategy (not as random as Battleline).  It is easy to get truly engrossed in this game while playing and the hidden point mechanic keeps things very exciting right up to the end.

Love the new FFG edition. Components look great and are nice and solid. Of course Chinese printing still doesn't feel quite as good as German in terms of shuffling in the bag, but that's minor. I love the double-sided board new addition of the new buildings. Just a small enhancement that makes a big difference. The wonder thing doesn't seem like it will matter that much, because it's pretty dang hard to build. But we'll see.

Eufraat & Tigris (that's the Dutch title for this game) is Reiner Knizia's undisputed masterpiece. Reiner made other fine games: Through the Desert, Ra, Amun Re, Taj Maha, to name a few. But none can hold a candle to this title. There are several reasons for this; I'll handle the technical ones first. First of all is that the rules of this games are simple and straightforward. Some complain about the opacity of the two types of conflict, and I agree that the game can be a bit rough until you get these nailed down pat. But they honestly aren't difficult: as usual with these things it takes more effort to write it down than it is to actually do. Second: no gamey rules. Everything is there for a reason. Nothing can be taken out, nothing needs to be added. Third: despite a random influx of tiles, there is plenty of opportunity to play around the luck of the draw. Randomness in this game is used as a means to introduce variety, not as an equaliser of different player levels. Fourth and final reason: the game scales well, whether you play with two, three, or four players. To get all these aspects right is [i]hard[/i] to begin with. But there are a few more things...

For players, the ruleset means that they need to get creative on their own. For me that is a hallmark of a good game. There is nothing resembling a feedback mechanism in E&T: everything that happens on the board is a result of what the players plan and act on. You cannot play this game automatically. Secondly, the game knows about emergent patterns. E&T isn't about randomly placing tiles and hoping for the best: no, the game settles into a certain pattern of growth and destruction of kingdoms which you need to know very well in order to exploit it to the full. It even allows you to get back from a tough position because at some point the attention of your opponents will shift to other places on the board: if someone is gouging themselves full on, say, red cubes, he is not very interested to put up a fight to hold on to a red temple. Good players will remember what a player collects and exploit that knowledge.

All in all, what remains is a wonderful title to learn, explore, and play. There is an addictive balance between strategic and tactical notions, and the various subgames occuring on the board result in a tremendous amount of variety. This is an exceedingly solid title which never fails to disappoint. And what makes it more exceptional is the fact that the game appeared in 1997. If you take into account the onslaught the game has had from the new gaming kids on the block, [i]and[/i] that it still remains in upper regions of this site without ever having left it... That is impressive.

[b]TIP[/b] Having trouble explaining or understanding the scoring rules? Try the following. The purpose of this game is to collect [i]sets[/i] of cubes, with a set being 1 red, 1 blue, 1 green and 1 black cube. The player who has the highest amount of sets at the end of the game wins. Is there a tie? Remove the most limiting colour and compare again.

[b]Update[/b] With BGG retiring its own edition of the game, and with gamers nowadays spoilt for so much choice that a game must deliver on the first go [i]or else![/i], the title is finally on its way down the ranks. I wish it would have been otherwise as I still think the game is simply a damned good [i]game[/i]... but unfortunately gamers have changed since the days it was published. I'm keeping my own copy, though.

RATING: 7.75
Much less elegant than TtD or Samurai, but the somewhat intricate rules are part of the charm.  It feels like some incomprehensibly esoteric game that would be played by aliens in a seedy science fiction bar.  And yet, like Cribbage, the complexity belies what is at heart a fairly simple game.  

The only thing I don't particularly like are the endgame conditions, or more specifically, having a game end due to running out of tiles.  It would feel very anticlimactic to have a game where two or more massive kingdoms slowly build up and amass power, only to have the game end before the seemingly inevitable cataclysmic battle.  Seems that adding 25ish more tiles would "solve" this gripe, though I suppose the sweeping changes in fortune that would result from forcing such a clash would undermine the slow and methodical play that is at the heart of the game.  The massive wars are always an option for those who choose that route.

RATING: 7.5
One of my favorite older strategy games. Balances decisive tile placement against player conflict very well. Victory point system is brilliantly and elegantly designed, rewarding players who best balance each of the four key areas of development within their civilization. The scope of the game is very focused with not a great deal of complexity, but a great amount of strategic planning, pitting each player's perceptiveness and daring directly against one another, making every more significant and tense. The downside is the randomness of the cards drawn, which have a sizable impact on the game, which can be frustrating when stalling a well-crafted and timed plan. All in all a great and satisfying game, but you have to enjoy direct competition and conflict, as it is a game of mutually exclusive manipulation - although  the internal/external conflict mechanics do an excellent job of creating a back door for players who have become dispossessed of their kingdoms to re-enter the game, and make for an enjoyable and precarious conflict procedure.

Well, a game I rated as medium heavy. A good gateway game into heavier games I would think. Took me many readings of the rules, man, they need a rework, with lots of videos, some cheat cheats, finally get it. It really isn't that hard, but, there is a learning curve. Not a game to whip out for a family game experience or for new players just to be included. Best think I can compare it to is learning how to play chess. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent game to invest into learning. It will take you 3 or 4 games and then the elegants of the game comes through. I am not a heavy gamer, but, this game is just enjoyable. It is best to muck you way through it with one experience player over a few games.

RATING: 8
This is a game that offers plenty of choices and rewards strategic planning.  Although realistically one just has to make the best choice in the moment!  Not for the light of heart, as this game practically requires you to be nasty to your opponents.  All said, a solid game that I'd certainly play again.

Good strategy game with lots of player interaction, the theme is an interesting one even though it's a euro which means its almost non-existent but this game can get really cutthrought. It's fun that you can merge kingdoms and create external conflicts(or war if you prefer) even if you are not part of the kingdoms yourself and just see a way to weaken your enemies. The monuments are really good and bring a lot of points to the table so there will be constant conflict for supremacy in kingdoms that have 1 or more monuments.

The fact that you have to be good in all 4 areas of the game(religion, farming, trading and kingdoms) and not just focus on 1-2 of them, makes the game even better as it forces the players to think more and interact more.

Hard to learn and conceptulize, and of course, explain. A brilliant simulation model so condensed it is abstract & broken. No one in our group wants to play this. Open yet secret victory points is stupid (and not required per the designer). A tile- draw- fest. Winning strategy-draw red tiles!. Don't  have enough? Quit.

Classic, brilliant, elegant, superb. A pinnacle of game design, maddeningly deep and rich, elegant beyond words, and nothing short of one of the best games serious gamers will ever play. I can't play it well to save my life, but it's a masterpiece by any standard of board gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game that provides a mix of opportunities for good moves and counter-moves. However, the frustrating thing is that they are dependent on the luck of the tile draws and your ability at guessing others tile draws. Against an equally-practiced opponent, this game is no more than a drawn-out crap shoot.

It is a great simulation of power struggle. It seems abstract, but I feel it thematic enough, and very interesting.

Update: It seems that luck is an ocasional player in this game, so I adjust rating downto 8 and trade it. I think it is not bad game, but luck in an abstract is not good for me.

Update: I want to play this game again, so I have purchased. Is the luck a big factor?. After reading other comments it seems not a problem for power players. I want to try myself.

Update: Much better now. I like spatial strategy in this game. Only played with two, but a great, exciting experience.

This is the best 'German' game of all time, mile better than 'Puerto Rico' for a start!  T+E is fantastic in that there is always something a player can do to improve their situation regardless of the tiles in hand or the situation on the board.  Thus the element of luck in the game (the drawing of tiles) is balanced by the relative freedom to put those tiles to several different uses.  The game can be played in several different ways, one can fight for control of temples, develop one's own kingdom, attack the kingdoms of other players in external in internal combat.

The best thing about T+E is that one can't write a FAQ or a 'how to play' sheet that covers most game situations.  The game is so fluid that one must think on one's feet all the time, waiting to exploit openings in an oppenents kingdom and being prepared to leave your own meticulously constructed kingdom behind once you already have enough cubes of a certain colour.  Brilliant.

Must be the most frustrating game i ever played.

You work for 8/9 turns trying a strategy only to have it fail miserably because your opponent drew one more tile of a specific color than you expected... and right there you lost the game, having needlesly to continue on the game since there's no way you can recover from it.

This scenario seems to occur in every game.

Easy rules, but way too deep for it's own good. Like chess in that you just KNOW you're going to lose against a more experienced player before you even start... Not fun.

I wonder if I'll get bored with this one. Every turn there are so many options by just laying a few tiles. The special scoring system makes it very challenging. Risks just have to be taken as there will always be one or two colors in which you are scoring badly.

2-4 players, 90-120 minutes, medium heavy, tile laying, Knizia

Recently purchased this game and tried it out tonight with my son (7). We had fun and did not bother each other....yet. That is something for next game. 

All in all the game looks nice and has a nice theme, the best part is the condition to win: you need to collect stones of 4 different colours, but you need to balance this, as only the colour with the least number of stones counts. I want to play this again soon :)

Update: played several games with 2, 3 and 4 players and upgraded the rating, as this is indeed a very good game and i.m.o. one of Knizia's best, possibly the best one.

One of my favorites, and Knizia's best. Doesn't at first appear to have much theme but it somehow *feels* like you are running and ruining civilizations. Lots of calculated risks are required to do well, although luck can play a big part. Few things in gaming are as satisfying as plotting out the perfect decimation of an opponent's kingdom. The odd scoring is brilliant...everyone always thinks they are losing.

Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris & Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.

Un jueguito interesante, muy ajedrecístico, quicir, muy muy abstracto, funciona como un reloj, y te mantiene en tensión todo el tiempo.

El principal problema es que tiene un componente Kingmaking bestial, sobre todo si juega un novato con gente más avezada, ganaré siempre el que se beneficie de las pifias del novato.

I enjoy playing this game online at http://www.gametableonline.com/ - Great strategy title of tile placement. The tiles do introduce a bit of luck into this game, and I have gotten screwed out of tiles when I needed them, but other than that, I enjoy this game. I don't think it has as much *fun* factor as other games, unless you derive fun from screwing over your opponents. You don't see many people smiling while playing this game. It requires a chess-like focus to play.

This is Reiner Knizia's best game design, in my opinion. Building monuments and then battling over them to score is fun, but this is also combined with the need to score evenly in all resources (a scoring mechanism which was later used to good effect in one of Knizia's later games, Einfach Genial). Catastrophe tiles can be pretty devastating and all players are subject to the luck of the draw, but players can move their leaders around freely to reduce the impact of the tile drawing. There are a world of possibilities for strategic play and also varied tactics available to support that strategy. Yes, this game is as good as they say it is.

Tigris & Euphrates is truly unlike any other game I've ever played.  Although the theme is so perfunctory that it's borderline abstract, it's also incredibly deep strategically, almost Chess-like.  I think I was having a hard time teaching it to people because I always felt as if I was shortchanging the myriad of different plays that you can make, especially where it concerns Internal and External Conflicts.

As I said to my opponents after our second play: "This is the sort of game that I really want to practice."  Frankly, I can't think of higher praise for a game.

To me, this is arguably Knizia's best game. Deep and a wonderful challenge every time you play. But it is a little dry and somewhat lacking in the "fun" department, which is why it doesn't make it to the table as often as it might otherwise.

RATING: 9
What I really like about this game is that even though it comes with a cool theme and design, you could cobble it together at a pinch with stones and coloured wooden squares. This relative simplicity means it should last a thousand years, like Chess, Go and Backgammon have. In this age of games with hundreds of different bits, resource costs and calculations, cards with fiddly bonuses and so on, it must be quite tricky to find a simple set of rules using a simple set of bits, yet still be able to create a game with the same mind-numbing analysis paralysis that this game often involves! I love it.

I recognize that this is a good, even great, game.  But it always gives me a headache, and I never have fun while playing it.  Partly down to the fact that I can never remember how conflicts get resolved and what happens after.  I just have a mental block.

 Got this for Christmas.  It is said to be Reiner Knizia's best game.  Well, compared to Relationship Tightrope, I'd have to agree.  Only one play so far, and that was only 2-player. I'm not even sure if we played it right, or not.  The rules are definitely counterintuitive, which means a lot of switching of mental gears.  Not an easy game to learn.  I'd really like to play with an experienced player, so I can learn it better. Then, I just might rate it higher.

OK, I got to play it a second time, and this time with a better understanding of the rules.  It's actually a pretty cool game.  Once again, It was only a 2-player game, so I'm still looking for a 4-player game to really get a handle on it, but I'm starting to like it more.
Unfortunately, my wife doesn't care for it, so I traded it away.

This is an outstanding game.

Hard to plan, devilish and completely absorbing, which is probably the weakness which dilutes a little bit the social interaction... until there is an external conflict!

Hardcore players will simply devour it. Hard to convince light players to play/enjoy in a late boardgame night.

Playing it regularly is a challenge but also one of the way to make it accessible as the difficulty is to grasp the difference and become familiar with the power and intricacies between internal/external conflicts.

Games vary dramatically from one another.

Again, my alltime favourite.

Design genius is obvious, but "inelegant" is almost an understatement. . . . It's another game that Isaac seems to win consistently. I think I'm beginning to see patterns here: of our frequently-played games that rely heavily on tactical decisionmaking (Yinsh, Coloretto, LotR-Confrontation), Isaac more than holds his own (he's pretty good at chess, too). Zachary and I are more in our element with games that emphasize strategical thinking, multidimensionality, or executive planning functions (Sleuth, Modern Art, PR, the classic space 4X4 tic-tac-toe game). We don't have any wargames, so maybe this will be our next purchase.

RATING: 6
When I first got on to Board Game Geek, this is the game I really drooled over, desired even. I read through all the reports on the game, looked at the strategy articles, and really absorbed what the game was about. It ended up being the first board game I ordered over the internet, because my FLGS, Coolstuff Inc., did not have a copy in stock. I even through myself into playing it here on BGG, despite the fact that I did (and still do) get trounced regularly. 

The game itself lived up to my anticipation for it, though I ended up having difficulty getting it on the table regularly. While others see a thin theme, I see the ebb and flow of civilization. Where others see the randomness of the tiles, I see the need to be flexible with what the game gives you. For a long, long time this was, in fact, my definite favorite game, but I have found myself requesting it less as time goes on in favor of other games like Agricola and Race For the Galaxy.

Unfortunately, the sheer quantity of times I have played it both face to face (the plays recorded here) and on-line have vastly dimmed my desire to play with inexperienced players. Not that I beat them all the time (I do not), but their lack of understanding of the strategy in the game usually increases the chaos to a degree that I find it less fun. I may lower its rating because of this, but I am not quite ready to yet.

This is a 2 to 4 player tile laying game, where players build up kingdoms of tiles on the board, and try to position their leaders to their best advantage. The game is won by taking cubes in four colours, but your score is the colour you have the least of. Ingenious mechanics and subtle deep game play. Simply wonderful. Buy it now.

Awesome game.  The rules are elegant, though sometimes complicated for new players, especially with respect to internal vs. external conflicts. I definitely recommend watching a rules explanation video or downloading one of the rules summaries available on this website. Takes some patience to learn and the willingness to play a few times before it clicks. Like the spatial aspect and a nice amount of randomness.

I've played once so far.  The ruleset is simple, which is something I appreciate, however the strategy is deep and not obvious upon first play.  Also, the outcome of your turn is not always obvious either, at least not to a new player, so it is difficult to plan your turn out.  Looking forward to a second play before rating this one.

Intense. Love playing in person and online. When I first joined this site, this game was in the top 5 and has subsequently fallen in the rankings. It's a shame - to win, you need a mix of strategy and tactics. Although people consider this an abstract, you definitely feel the narrative as kingdoms rise and fall. This style of game is just less popular than the opaque resource conversion games that are so popular these days. The depth in this one comes from your opponents.

What a game! It's clearly a derivative of Acquire, but wow what a good one! It is a bit much to consider all at once during your turn; I prefer Knizia' faster Samurai for a similar experience that is much easier to play and explain. I don't own this game: I would've bought it ages ago but I can't afford to keep paying Mayfair Games ransom for overpriced cardboard! In fact, their crapy revision and insane pricetag have driven me to seek out a German edition...

I think it has a fantastic game design, I appreciate the game and have no issues with its overall ranking, but I don't enjoy playing it very much.  It never "grabbed" me the way other games have.  

While I believe it is a better game design than something like Yspahan or Colosseum, I would much rather play these latter games.

Of the Euro-Games, I think this is the best one (from an elegant design perspective).  It plays equally well with both 3 and 4 players which is rare since most 3 player games turn into a 2 on 1 situation or where 1 player winds up being kingmaker.  Sure it happens in this game, but just not as much as others.  I don't really care about theme, so the abstract nature of the game doesn't bother me.  Has slowly slipped in rating as new Euro's have come out. Some people say its a good 2 Player game, but unless you make the board smaller or something, its pretty lame 2 Player.

And I don't care about the "lack of theme" - to me it's just red, blue, etc. anyway.

Deserves the plaudits of being a classic. Playing it, you can't help but appreciate what Knizia is capable of as a games designer and understand why he is considered to be one of the giants of the industry.
    T&E offers up a challenging puzzle with a lot of player interaction. Interesting ways of scoring points and manipulating the landscape of the board make for a large variety of possible moves for you to think about. 
    It's quite hard to pull back the lead from someone who has gotten too far ahead but with experienced players it looks like the game will balance out nicely. Theres a bit of luck and suspense involved in the 'combat' when jostling for control of zones on the board because of the hidden information behind player screens. 
    It's really a uniquely interesting game which definitely deserves a spot in my collection.

RATING: 9
Here is my first impression:
"Maybe it's just because I've only played this 2-player, but this game seems to be the complete opposite of the other Euro games I enjoy. I just don't find the mechanics to be clever or engaging. A good example of "more is less" for me."

On further investigation, this game floors me. I still agree that this isn't an "elegant" game in that it has a simple but profound mechanic like most designer games. It's just a whole different beast.  The planning and creativity required by this game makes my head 'splode with intensity; some of the moves are so Machiavellian and evil. I still haven't played with more than two players, as I suspect the "kingmaker" situation would cause me to get a little too emotionally "invested". Two player can have a bit of back-and-forth bickering with the internal conflicts, which I see as problematic.

RATING: 5
I've played this classic a few times, but never really enjoyed it.  I don't really have a problem with the Knizia scoring, per se.  It works in this game, as well as several others.  The problem comes in the fact that the tile draws are random, and it takes half your turn to try and get better ones.  Their values shift over time depending on which cubes you've collected, but some are always better than others.  You can't get points at all unless you have leaders on the board, and you need red tiles to get/keep them there.  Blue tiles are essential for connecting civs across the rivers, but otherwise much worse than the others, since they can only be placed in specific spots.  Black, as I recall, also has a slight edge over green.
There's inevitably a time in each game I've played where I wind up with 6 blue tiles.  Well, you can use them to start a battle, win it handily, and get rid of all your tiles, then hope to draw something better.  That'll net you a bunch of blue points, but it doesn't really improve your situation.  If you're stuck trying to improve your worst color, you may not have any good options.  To score in that color, you need your leader on the board, but forget about placing him later on if you don't have reds.  Even if he's there, not having tiles of that color to place means you can't get anywhere.  Ingenious at least has the rule that you can get a free mulligan at the end of your turn if you don't have any of the color that's your lowest.  In this game, you're stuck spinning your wheels until you can draw something useful.
I've also never seen the monoliths do anything useful.  Producing a cube a turn seems powerful, but it may help the other players as much as it helps you; more if you can't defend it.  

Anyway, for such a well-regarded game, I've always found it a frustrating mess of unintuitive rules and random screwage.

Very brief comment: My very first game, finally get to played this classic Knizia's game. I have to say that the internal and external conflict are interesting so to speak. A little abstract but it's fine with me.

The tile laying mechanics is pretty interesting as there are a lot to see. Every player each has four leaders they need to balance with as the final scoring is done by only taking the lowest score among the four leaders/colours.

Superb Knizia game, excelent theme, with lots of strategy. I prefer to play it with the house rule of choice among 6 open tiles or from the bag to refresh your hand.

Great game that offers a lot of possibilities every turn and thus is very replayable with lots of variety.  Most games offer good interaction between players’ different kingdoms (unless players mostly just tend to their own holdings).  There is a luck factor in drawing tiles, which can be frustrating, but may keep the game from being too analytical; although it can become a conflicted game that appears to want a lot of analysis but undermines it with luck.  Could be too analytical for a multiplayer game (possibly best with 2 or 3 players...).

Végre sikerült játszanom vele, pedig már vagy 3 éve megvan. Mindenki azt mondta előtte, h bonyolult szabályok, s h így meg úgy. Elmondva kb 25 perc volt, és lehetne jobban, rövidebben. És egész világos, érthető a játékmenet.
Ami jó: sok konfrontáció, igen interaktív. Rengeteg lehetőség benne, nagyon tetszett. h nem 9.5-10 az értékelés az az első játéknak tudható be: de szerintem még növekedhet. Illetve persze az is számít, h nem 10 -14 éve ismertem meg, akkor biztos 10-es lenne. De ez mutatja, h mennyire jó a játék, h még 14 évesen is meg tud fogni, mégha már az ötletei, újdonságai ezer más helyen visszaköszöntek, így ismertek voltak.
Időt álló játék, szerintem kötelező darab.

Euphrat & Tigris is the kind of game which is a real brain burner! Lot's to think about during the game.

Euphrat & Tigris has lots of different possibilities if you got the right tiles. Having the color tiles you need more or less at a given time can limit your choices during your turn.

Either you have the right tiles to save your a$$ at the right time or you see your oppenent run you over. You would want to do something specific, but you can't because you don't have the right colored tiles.

I have not played this game in the last couple of months due to it plays only up to four. It would be nice to get this game on the table again. We are often 5-7 players. Definately a game which is worth more plays, but Euphrat & Tigris is not for everybody. I used to play it a lot online a couple of years back.

I need to put this game out on the table soon at home. Played twice in one day at the Concordia group in July 2005 the last time.

An abstracted area control game played by laying tiles to outmaneuver opponents vying for control of ever expanding empires. Such strategic decisions to make every turn right until the end. The monuments seem to really generate a decent income of specific colours. I do not think a win is possible without very cunning play.

45-60m, best with 4 players. < 5 plays.

The legendary game was never a favorite of mine.  Too abstract and the mechanics were unintuitive to my mind.  I supposed if I played with people that were far worse at the game thand I then it might have made more sense to me, but I was always playing with vets who just crushed me.  Held onto my german version for years hoping that I'd somehow be converted, but eventually I sold it to a friend.

An excellent tile laying game by Knizia; one of his best! This game is very cerebral and will take a few plays to learn the subtle manuevers. However, once learned, your trained eye will focus naturally on each tile laying tactic. Beautiful game components. I think it plays best with 4, but others have enjoyed playing with just 2 players.

One of Knizia's best games. Tile-laying as a metaphor for warfare between civilizations. Heavy-duty confrontation from beginning to end. Lots and lots of direct confrontation.

I played Ingenious before this and I thought it was neat that the end game scoring mechanism is similar.  The actual game play is totally different however.  This is a very confrontational game even though there is a lot of Euro aspects to the game.  One thing that bothered me is that the King and the Trader are important pieces with unique abilities but unfortunately the Priest and Farmer are nothing more than circular tokens that influences a tile of their respective colour. There also seems to be an issue of who can get a lot of red tiles at key points during the game.

Don't have much to say. Personally, it's a very close second or third behind Power Gird and Caylus. Only reason it's behind those is because I'm horrible at it. It's rated higher because this is great with any number of players, 2-4.

An interesting twist on the civilization genre. Instead of building out a tableau, players seed the Eyptian desert and witness the rise and fall of empires. Once the few rounds of peaceful growth pass, the game enters a state of constant flux, where monuments will be built, usurper will claim power, and civilizations will be fractured by war. Tactics rule, but medium-term strategies are necessary as well. The rapid escalation the game undergoes after a few monuments/buildings have been placed is incredible, and helps round out the scope of the game. Tigris and Euphrates taxes your brain in a unique way, and while not being very accessible, it is vastly rewarding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Almost completely abstract tile laying game. The only luck is the draw of the tiles. Always plenty of choices, and some deep player interaction/conflict.

Really a fantastic game.  It does have its share of problems, in that it has rather picky rules (although they become second nature after a few plays), it is difficult for new players (in part because of the former problem, but only in part), and it is exceptionally confrontational and not for the thin-skinned.  The game can be very ruthless to players who've spent a lot of time developing a kingdom, since points, not kingdoms, are what the game is about and kingdoms, much like in ancient Sumer, come and go.  It's brilliant in that respect, but if players don't get it, it can be an awfully hard go.

Definitely a thinking game, a little bit of an abstract, and absolutely brutal with good players.  The need for a balanced win is an outstanding mechanic that makes this game a pleasure and challenge.  Win this against good players and you feel like you've accomplished something.

[2 plays]  Wow.  A classic that I've wanted to play for ages, and just finally got around to it.  So far I really like it.  Yeah, there's a luck element in the tile draw; the second time I played both I and another player did not draw a single blue tile for about the first two-thirds of the game.  Maybe I'd have been annoyed if I were more experienced and competitive at the game, and not still approaching it in the spirit of "How fun it is to learn this nifty game!"  But it wasn't that annoying--maybe because the bad luck was ongoing and could change at any time.  

I think that's less annoying than either a game where you get bad luck at the beginning and then are stuck in a losing position the whole rest of the time, or a game where you build stuff up thinking it's going well, and then some kind of bad luck ruins it.  With something like dice rolls or tile draws, it could get better at any time.  If it doesn't, you may look back on the game and denounce the streak of ill fortune that held you down, but it's not like a single crushing stroke.  

Anyway, this is a clever game with a nice mix of stuff going on.  I think the theme actually fits it well.  Unlike Vinci, which disappointed me because I expected a civilizationy feel and didn't get one, in Tigris and Euphrates the theme of rising, falling, and struggling civilizations seems to fit the dynamics.  The interrelationships have enough density to make it interesting and challenging, but not so much that it seems futile (the way I felt about Dominant Species).  

I am looking forward to playing this some more.

Having tried this once, I enjoyed it immensely.  It's not overly brainburning, although I'm not sure about my wife getting AP, and her thoughts about the amount of confrontation it has.  I have Mayfair's revised edition (2008) which includes an expansion map on the reverse side of the board.
See my pictorial guide to the new edition here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/376984

Teaching video [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/628367/introducing-our-first-how-to-play-video-htpv-tigri]here[/url].  Suggestion: call internal conflict `revolution' (or `coup') and external conflict `war'; see also [thread=1107315][/thread].

Easier way to describe win condition: player who has collected the most sets of cubes (with a set consisting of one cube in each of the four colours).

Strategy tip from Martin G

[q][b]Misconception:[/b] the player who draws most red tiles wins

[b]Reality:[/b] inexperienced players just haven't figured out the many ways of getting what you want that this game gives you beyond internal conflicts. If you're not drawing red, you must be strong in other colours. Use those tiles to win external conflicts. Or use catastrophes cleverly. Or build monuments. Or...

And even more importantly, if you're not drawing enough red, you're probably not drawing enough tiles total. The ABC of T&E is Always Be Cycling. Don't just play one or two tiles each turn; look for opportunities to spend several in an external conflict (even if you lose). The more you draw, the less likely you are to be weak in a colour.[/q]

I guess Knizia is a distinct taste. Either you revere his contribution to the hobby or, like me, you find his stuff dull. This one, however, is a Knizia game that I appreciate (if not play) very well. It's a brilliant design. The conflict effects are so intricate, however, that the game is fragile and chaotic if not played by experienced players. Once you get to that point with your group, the game shines.

Strategy has to change depending on how many you play with and is a wonderful game because of it.  I'm terrible but that only makes it more enchanting to me.  A great mix between war strategies and euro decision making.

First you have to deal with three or four games filled with confusion as you try to 'get' the rules, then you spend three or four games getting your butt handed to you by your brother because you wasted the whole game fighting to own a stupid temple on the east side (even though your brother owns 3 temples on the west side.) Then you realize that you've got to start thinking before playing. It's at this stage that I decided to pull out the Xbox.

But, seriously, this is a decent game as long as you're not a dunderhead. If you are a dunderhead...Xbox!

Update: After a dozen more sessions, I'm still waiting for this to be fun. Sure, there are inovative scoring systems at play. But so what?

Even more Update: Sold it.

Based on 13 plays.
+ One of the best Eurogames there is
+ Nice combination of an abstract game and an "historical simulation" or some sort.
+ Rather good pace for such a brain-burner
+ Good graphical design with players as symbols and colors as point types.
> I haven't played with advanced setting (Ziggurat) yet. There's enough in the base game to understand for now.
> The cubes are trackable, so should the players' cubes be open information? Personally I want to keep them hidden and force players not to take written notes.
- I'd like to grant points also for tiles that connect two kingdoms if no conflicts arise. It just feels more intuitive. And why shouldn't I be able to connect two kingdoms with a leader if no conflicts arise?
- Agonizing over bad tiles is rather common. Yes, I know: discarding and drawing is the solution.

There's nothing wrong with this game except for the board. The starting squares are always in the same place, which makes T&E samey after a copule of games. But I guess you can change that by randomly selecting another squares to begin your game with. Unfortunately, you cannot relocate the river and that is a pain in the neck as you ALWAYS will place the blue tiles in the same way. 

That said, it's a solid game I am ready to play from timie to time.

So far, this is my favorite "heavy" Euro game.  Some people are bothered by the randomness of the tile draw, but I don't find it to be worse than any other game with a random element.  It is weird, though, that there is no scaling mechanic for two- or three-player games. Hopefully I won't send people running for the hills when I try to teach it, but it should interest my Samurai-loving friends.

Haven't played this forever, but the iOS version has reminded me why I love it so much. I [u]really[/u] need to get this one out again.

Ignore those who think the game is dry and abstract - they have no idea what they are talking about. Unlike modern Euros, this game is confrontational, destructive and swingy. To quote my friend Orntt, "the best part is that you are rewarded for screwing other people over!"

The game is well-themed at a higher level; Knizia eschews the common mechanics used to represent civilisations (units, cities and dice) and creates an innovative product. Each leader has slightly different special powers, and each colour a slightly different role.

The positional aspects of kingdom separation, "good shape", and the vulnerability of monuments are interesting, and I really love the separation of players and kingdoms that allows very devious tactics via revolutions and wars. I've found the midgame disappointing because of the chaos and wild swings.

Although it's abstracted and simple in many ways, it gives a very tense multiplayer wargame feel for me.  It's a neat birds eye view of spreading and merging nations.  It took a couple of plays to get my head around it.  If you can handle some conflict and are able to learn a few abstract rules, give it a try.  A game I like but am not good at.  Tense with just the right amount of randomness.

Note:  I've been playing this more and I really do like it.  The game isn't really as hard as I thought it was (or as heavy).  The trick is 'seeing' the board and understanding the possibilities for your turn.  T&E is one of those games where you always seem to see a great move after you've finished your turn!   It  just takes a several plays to get past the abstractions and you have to keep with it.  Most importantly you have to pay attention to the scoring and keep a cube color balance.  If you get caught up in doing stuff on the map and lose track of your color balance you won't do well.  The scoring system is the game.

Looking forward to more plays!

RATING: 9
[Tile Placement/Civilization Building/Wargame] {2P:9, 3P:9, 4P:10} Superb game, and one that seems to have unlimited replayability. The extremely strong theme of the rise and fall of civilizations, and the greed of men (especially the greed of men) fits extremely well into the game; it's not surprising that the game was developed after the story was written. Multiple roads to victory, deep strategy and tactics, angst-filled turns and a delicious victory condition to make this practically an obligatory addition for any collection of German games. I like E&T best with four players due to the tightness of the board and the scarcity of real estate, but it also plays excellently with two or three players. *** UPDATE: Reaffirming my 10, one year after I first played the game. E&T is the real deal. The depth continues to astound, and what I initially believed to be irritating randomess in the tile draw has become the lynchpin of this masterpiece. There is still nothing like it. *** UPDATE: Well, I've been focusing a lot on E&T as of late, and with more familiarity comes plumbing the depths and reflection on the findings. E&T is a great game because it is different from many of its bretheren. After over 100 games, I know I'm still going to be playing this game years from now.

A 2 hour game that has smart mechanics and clever scoring system.
This game is about taking up opportunities in the short and medium term, which can be very challenging to our brain. However, long term strategies are very difficult to sustain, as no position is permanently secure.
The game promotes individual logic deduction rather than player interaction. This is the first thing I dislike in it.
For my gaming taste, the weakest point of the game is the level of abstractness. I love when a game gives me a sense of reality. With T&E this doesn’t happen at all.
Despite the negative factors (for me), the intelligent game mechanics make me enjoy the game.

Initially I was luke warm to this abstract. I preferred more theme, more direct confrontation. But perhaps half way through my second game I became hooked. I've only ever played with two players and apparently it's better with more but I love the way the game builds up and then all hell breaks loose as you keep finding ways in to each others civilizations to score more points. And the scoring itself is really well done, ensuring that you can always focus on your opponents weak points to try and best them.

A really good game with the right people.

I love analyzing the colorful geometries that rise and fall across the board, and I think the scoring and combat mechanisms in this game are well balanced. Despite the fact that I am awful at this game, I am a T&E fan.

A while back, I really appreciated the online T&E provided here; it really was a great version of the game and I truly appreciated being able to use it freely. Despite this, I did have some ideas to make it better. Many games lasted a few weeks, and it was therefore quite difficult to get a feel for the game with such long breaks between turns. And we all know how cumbersome reading the game log was. I had a mission to learn the appropriate code languages so that I could code up a program capable of solving that problem of "reading" the game log and presenting it in a visual format, just as it was played, but I gave up on that.

Again, how much do I owe Knizia? GENIUS!!!!

Reiner Knizia főműve. :)
Régóta érdekelt játék, most végre sikerült kipróbálni. Vegyes érzelmeket váltott ki belőlem. 
A vesszőparipám: a tematika. Érdekes módon Kniziához hűen nincs sok tematika a játékban, de valahogy itt ez mégse zavart. Valahogy menet közben összeáll az egész élmény, és valamiért most nem igényeltem, hogy legyen válasz minden mechanizmus vs témával kapcsolatos kérdésre. Szóval ez itt egy jó pont :)
A mechanizmus: viszonylag egyszerű szabályokkal, nagyon sok kombinációt és lehetőséget kínál. Ez nagyon jó. Nem mondom, hogy első játék után átláttam a lényeget. Egy-két taktikai megérzésem lett, de biztos tartogat még meglepetéseket a játék. Talán kicsit úgy éreztem, hogy a végjátékban a piros lapoknak a súlya aránytalanul megnő, ami a szerencse szerepét növelheti. De ezt azért még nem merem biztosan kijelenteni. :)
És végül egy-két negatívum is:
A tábla és az alkatrészek valahogy nem annyira tetszettek (pegasus).
Érzésem szerint ez a játék nekem túl absztrakt, sakkszerű lesz, de ehhez azért még jópárat jétszani vele, hogy biztosan kiderüljön. :)

Is it a civilization game? Is it an abstract? Probably a little bit of both. The rise and subsequent fall of the various kingdoms certainly shines through but tile placement, scoring rules, and also the occasionally large swings in fortune move the game closer to the abstract side.

In any case, T&E is an aggressive game, with lots of direct conflict. It also seems to me like it starts out in a precarious balance that is easily broken by players just floundering about. A large part of that is because the game just is a nail-biter. Every move counts, and a wrong move counts double. Therefore I strongly expect the game to be much better with an experienced group of players. And yet, even though it's usually close and I think I appreciate what the game tries to do for some reason it's not really engaging.

Great game. 

The setting: ancient middle east, on the shores of the Tigris & Euphrates. Objective: build a civilisation which will flourish througout the years.

The options within this game are almost limitless. You can start your own civilisation, join the ones build be your competitors or even take over there civilisations.

Each aspect of your civilisation deserves your attention because the aspect which earns the least points at the end of the game will determine who wins.

Great feature within this game is the possibility the start internal and external conflict. With both you'll need do some math before you decide to start a conflict. And even when you've done the math, you'll still need a bit of luck.

Disadvantage of the game? The only one I can discovere is the two-player-mode. This game is best played with three or four players. If you play it with two players te board is to big.

Why don't I own this game anymore? Simply because I don't get to play it very often. The people I play with don't like it. So I'll just have to purchase the I-pad version.

Wow! What an experience. It's abstract but feels like an ancients civ game. Has appeal with my wargamer friends, and with my eurogamer family. Not ultra complicated but nearly endless depth.

T&E is an odd game to me. I've loved it and hated it. I've played by the rules and played by strong house rules. However, for every bad experience I've had with the game, I've had twice as many great experiences, so that's something right? At the moment I have warm feelings about the game. Talk to me again in a month.  

[2014.12.01] - 8.25
I've found this to provoke aggressiveness in tactics and may even surpass Chess WRT head-to-head play.  Aside from being a beautiful game visually, the game unfolds after a few plays and continues to do so as I play more and more.  Against very good players this game is an exercise in humility.

[2015.08.20]
Almost a year later I have pulled away from this game.  Played by the rules it's entirely too random.  Played open scoring and open-handed is a better game IMO, but it loses most of its aggression.  It's basically a different game -- one that no one is likely to play with me.

This game makes my brain hurt...in a good way!  This is a very intense Knizia land conquering game.  There are several strategies one could take and the game has a lot of depth, but it takes so long to play and requires so much attention and energy that I'm not sure I'll ever play it enough times to fully appreciate its depth.

Fantastic tile-laying civilization building game with lots of player interaction.  Subverts a lot of standard game concepts such as "my kingdom", "I'm red" and the scoring system.  All of these makes you think differently about what is actually happening within the game.

Was my favorite game for about 6 years. Great strategy. Relatively short. Can play two games in an evening and you feel FULFILLED when you win. This one has it all for me. Great turn angst. Lot's of strategy. Many choices. I love this one even when I lose. However, it has slipped a bit in the last 4 years. Attika and Scythe have replaced it. I guess time just takes the lustre off as newer games come to the fore.

I started off thinking this was such a pleasant game- playing tiles and building kingdoms and la-de-da. Then, BAM there's conflict all the fricken time and you are ready to cry and kill and throw yourself down at the alter and then WOOSH it's over and you score and are just so proud of yourself for not losing too bad.  What a fantastic game! Simple really, but so deep and fascinating. The conflict between players is sweet. There's nothing like this game. Knizia's signature piece. A classic Euro.

  Tigris for me is what a wargame should be, although it is not often referred to as such.  The tile placement creates such a strong feel of growing influence within kingdoms, and conflict resolution always results in favour of the player who has positioned themself the best.  Knizia's best.

Very interesting game. Somewhat abstract and difficult to teach to others - largely because it has a very unique conflict system.  There is hidden information, a bit of luck and only two actions per person per turn, so analysis paralysis is limited. I know that I SHOULD like this more than I seem to (I always choose something else to play).  I have owned it and then traded it away three times. The right length.  Some day, I know I'll get into this game a end up appreciating it more than I do.

Very open-ended and deep brainburner with choices galore. Maybe a bit more luck of the draw than I'd expect from such a serious and well balanced game, but manageable risk all the same. However, very few people with whom I play share my favorable opinion, so buyers beware: not everyone will be as fond of it as the high ratings here on BGG would seem to suggest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love everything about Tigris & Euphrates. I call it a thematic abstract game because it plays like an abstract but the mechanics actually do fit the theme very well. I love how the scoring always challenges you to balance your points. The push and pull of building large kingdoms only to be destroyed in external conflicts, and then stealing positions in established kingdoms to make up points is very satisfying and creates great player interaction. Some might say that the randomness of the tiles is problematic, but I think it helps to motivate players to cultivate the adaptive and creative strategies needed to win control over kingdoms and monuments. I like what Knizia says about the randomness: a seasoned player can adapt their strategy to the tile randomness and will most likely win every time against a new player, but the games will be close enough that the loser always enjoys playing the game. While the game is deep, it is very easy to teach and scales wonderfully from 2 to 4 players. I love every aspect of this game and consider it my favorite board game of all time.

Exciting, well produced, BrianBurning, 1,5h-long. Great!

Man! This is just what I wanted. Great game for 2. 

With 4 there are many more decisions to be taken, the game's a lot more chaotic... and when you don't have enough red tiles - you're in a big trouble.
Still love it.
The best tension and the gameplay itself is with 3 and 4 players. Best when played with agressive players that don't scare to risk.

My 2nd 10 on BGG. Damn! I really love it. Full of choices. The luck factor isn't really important. You can always find a way to gain VP's in the colour you need. Great, great, great!

Love it! Love it! Love it!

Over the three play sessions with this game I really wanted to like it, but I found it very frustrating (particularly the random tile draw).  The strategies seemed very esoteric and very obtuse.

I wish I got to play this more often.  It's a fun game where planning ahead works, and the more confrontation the better!  I never feel stress about decisions, it's fun to wage war, and everyone has a great time.  Sure, the theme is dubious, but the gameplay is genius.  Knizia's finest game.  If he ever tops this one, I will die.

A classic. Some very interesting mechanisms pertaining to confrontation in this brain burning, head-scratcher, which is in fact, more of a chess-like experience to some degree. Easy to see why this is a classic. But it can be a bone dry strategy game experience, since the theme does not come through much (or is even necessary). The only poor luck issue, as many mentioned, is that the player who draws more red tiles will have a better chance at winning (especially over someone drawing many blue tiles).

Update: Really like the 2015 version- the tiles are more aesthetic and I don't mind the plastic pieces (although the wood was fine).

Reiner Knizia. "Emergent"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[b][i]Tigris & Euphrates[/i][/b] is an area control game that illustrates why Reiner Knizia is known as a great designer. The game is mechanically simple, but with such involved strategy as to guarantee it a place in the pantheon of great games. Many (including myself) enjoy T&E for the strategical play.

An unexpected reason why I enjoy this game is that, somehow, it feels thematic. Everyone is building civilizations and your leaders are competing for the influence of the people. I wouldn't recommend it for its theme, but don't be surprised if you end up role-playing your characters.

I like this game a fair bit.  I tend to be a fan of RK's games.  Not cult like fan, but a fan.  This game takes a few tries with some good players to really get a good grasp on it.

RATING: 10
I really like the connection between theme and gameplay; it's quite abstract, yet the rules create a strong metaphor for the rise and fall of ancient civilizations.

E&T really seems to scratch some deep mental itch for me. I like how the board changes dramatically over time, forcing you to constantly adapt your gameplan. I find the thought process behind formation of short-term strategies to be immensely satisfying.

Best with 3, good with 2, becomes a bit too chaotic with 4.

The latest revision comes with an "advanced game" variant, which provides one "civilization building" in each color.  The presence of such a building doubles the tile placement points in that color within a kingdom.  I played this variant once, and was thoroughly unimpressed.  The additional scoring method adds some "bookkeeping complexity" without actually making the game any more interesting.

May 2009 -- I've played this game several times and found it challenging and fun each time. It has a little too much conflict for my wife and daughter to enjoy it, and our son hasn't had a chance to try it, but three of us like to play it.

November 2012 -- I would like to play this game more often, but only my son-in-law and I really enjoy it, so it doesn't get played much. It is a very challenging game, and it requires close attention to play it well.

To be honest, I haven't been able to give this game the chance it probably deserves. Get to play this far too rarely. Probably would like it better if I got more familiar with it as it seems very freeform game, where you can do lots of different moves in any given situation.

A good game requiring strategy and balance to succeed.  The lowest score of each of your colours win forces you to balance yourself so as to get a high score overall instead of trying to dominate in one area.

2-player rating. This is hardcore. A vicious, exhausting, bare-knuckled turf fight that never lets up. Wrapping one's mind around the principles of conflict takes a game or two, and the administrative tallying of the monuments in FTF games can be distracting and easily overlooked when consumed with battle plans.

Update: Mere hours later and just one more game, my reluctance crumbles. A solid, splendid 9, my first yet. An inspired thing of genius, this game.

Update: Almost as excellent with 4, though the games demand players of equal skill to keep everyone in check and balance.

Must be played with open scoring.

This is a tough one for me.  My friends love it and they can't wait to play it.  For some reason for me, I have a really hard time 'seeing' what is going on in this game.  The board and where you are can change so dynamically that you just can't be attached to anything you have built.  Also, I think you really need to be aggressive into breaking into what others have built.  I like many of the concepts of the game, and I will play it, but for me this just isn't my style of game.  Maybe my opinion will improve with repeated plays.

Reminds me of the tactical nature of Neuroshima Hex. It's a bit longer and drier. It seems like it's hard to understand at first, but the rules are kind of simple once you become accustomed to them. Definitely an interesting game.

As time has gone by, this game has lost sense of theme. It's just too abstract for my tastes, and has begun to feel...well, like a Knizia game. (Which for the most part feel the same.)

More and more plays are showing me that the &#039;tile drawing luck&#039; becomes more prevalent when the players are evenly matched. You do what you have to do to build a strong kingdom, but all those plans can be dashed by a player that happens to draw 4 or 5 of a certain color over a few turns for a damaging attack. I still enjoy playing, but I don&#039;t see it as the super meaty strategy game that I used to view it as.

Excellent but hard to master. Although it's abstract, it has very nice theme. It gives you a lot of strategies and tactics and every game is very tense for me.

This is an abstract game and I dont like abstract game at all. So the first time I played I was pretty cold towards it. But after two or three games I was really really impressed. It is an almost perfect game of with a lot of thinking and some dosis of luck in the tiles drawing. It has some drawbacks, as the analisis paralyisis with some players or the fact that, due to the abstract rules, is sometimes difficult for the newcomers, but anyway this game is really wonderful. Some players just dont get it. It is a little bit more complex than the average eurogame, not because of its rules (the instructions booklet is very good) but because of the game´s nature and the scoring system that Knizia uses in it.

There are so many great ideas in this game. The point system is brilliant, the battles are always tense and interesting, it has smartly designed built-in catch-up mechanisms and the way it forces you to fight and outwit your opponents is wonderful.

There are things I don't like though. The worst problem is that one bad player or play can very easily decide the game. I don't want to be elitist, but the game breaks down unless everyone is at the same skill level. There's also a lot of fiddly upkeep and things easily forgotten, like everyone having to draw from the same bag after everyone's turn. You can also be screwed by bad, random draws which is annoying given the otherwise abstract feel of the game. The player order is also a bit too important for my liking. I think the game would be less random and less fiddly if everyone had their own equally (or perhaps not depending on the player order) distributed bags of tiles, but who am I to question the great Dr. Knizia?

I can definitely see why people love it and if I had a group dedicated to learning this game properly I'm sure we'd have a lot of fun. As it is now I think it's a good game, but not great.

Only one play (played the card game once before)... I like it!

RATING: 9.1
Bought June 2015.

This game is a masterpiece. In no other game I have played is there the potential to be almost completely wiped out from the board halfway through the game, and yet still have every chance of fighting your way back and ekeing a win.

The board is always the same, but each game feels different - in one game there'll be loads of monuments right from the start, in another hardly any; in one game the fighting will start early and small, the next game will build up to a couple of huge battles at the end, and the next will hardly have any battles at all.

There's a joyful element of brinksmanship as you build your individual kingdoms, waiting for the optimum time to strike. Risk-taking, creative thinking and clever sacrifices are often rewarded. You can be left in tatters at the end but still win, or if you're not careful you can seem all-powerful yet be pipped to the post.

If you're looking for a game that's highly interactive and dynamic, this is the best.

Owning new Fantasy Flight Games edition. Excellent game, excellent components and aesthetics, excellent theme. Game is tense in every phase - from early game to last move. Even when it is close to end, you can still collect points by making huge war. Everyone is very involved in game from it's first till last minute. There is much conflict in game, this is almost a war game. Peaceful development is possible, but your kingdom will be attacked very soon as players try to get most points and valuable kingdoms. Revolts and wars are very common in this game, so be aware about that in your gaming group. There is luck in tile drawing from bag, but just enough to keep the game balanced and forces players to consider risk in every move carefully. To do well in game, clever strategical moves are essential as well using good opportunities to build defense or prepare for attack.

Even after many, many games, I haven't quite decided whether this is a game with a little bit of luck or a game with a lot of luck. Ultimately, I really don't care because it's so unbelievably fascinating and enjoyable to play, and because the scope for richly-textured strategic and tactical play is astounding.

Knizia sometimes gets accused of using slapped-on themes, and this game is one that is often mentioned in that argument. Which baffles me. The feel of this game matches its theme almost perfectly. Ancient Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent was a place of constant upheaval and quickly-changing politics, with an endless stream of leaders and civilizations battling for supremacy. Playing Euphrat & Tigris really puts me in that thematic mindset of scheming and adaptation and opportunistic takeovers. I love the way that the game forces you to constantly rethink your strategy as the landscape and power structure evolves. You may be living large off the fat of the land, but eventually you'll probably have to uproot and reinvent yourself.

This is a solid, good game but it is a real brain burner. Since I only play it once a year or less, I have to re-discover rules and strategy every time I play, so I never do all that well at it. It is one I would play any time, but it's not one that gets suggested very often or that I would probably ever throw on the table. There are just way too many other games people would rather play in the same amount of time these days.
If you will be playing this more than once a year, I'd say buy it. If not, its a bit painful when you finally dust it off and try it again.

Finally got a chance to play T&E...very underwhelming. I have to admit, I am a little surprised to see it ranked so highly. A game where so much relies on which tiles you have in your hand at any given time (i.e. whenever someone decides to attack you). Seems so chaotic. Having a conflict and holding no red tiles is one of the most excruciating boardgame experiences out there. Only topped by being beaten in a conflict by an opponent holding 4+ red tiles followed by watching another opponent win a conflict with 2. That this happened in my first game knocks several points off my rating.

(Maybe unfair to rank such a highly regarded game this low after one play, but this is how I feel about playing it and I doubt I will play it again.)

Seventeen plays face-to-face, lots more online. 

A brilliant design. It's a fairly deep game, but the key to enjoying it, I've found, is to take it seriously but not *too* seriously. There is a lot of strategy that can be applied, but in the final end there is a certain amount of luck involved as well. I like the game best with three players; with four it can be a bit more chaotic as kingdoms collide because of lack of space, and there's not much point to building monuments since they tend to change hands rather quickly.

Most of my plays are on the iOS version but I have played a few times on the table. I wouldn't normally rate this style of game but there's something about it that I really enjoy. It might be the theme, as thin as it is, which does give a genuine feel of kingdom building in the cradle of civilisation.....or more likely it's the direct conflict which is unusual for Euros and appeals to my wargaming instincts. REgardless of reasons, it's one I'm keen and happy to play at any time.

Played four or five times so far really don't like it. Feel heavily penalised for never drawing red tiles, and reach situations where everything i can do will be taken over in the next play by someone else. The highest rated really dull game in my opinion.

Doesn't help that i was playing experts, but in other games i grasp the tactics prety quick. This one tbh i can't be bothered anymore.

Unlike anything else I've ever played, despite imitators.  This is the very definition of a gamer's game--abstract, with heavy emphasis on both strategy and tactics.

RATING: 9
This is a hard one for me to accurately rate. On the one hand, the mechanisms are near-brilliant. It's very challenging (and rewarding) to figure out how to equalize the colours of your victory points given an uneven tile draw. On this basis, Tigris deserves the rating of 9 that I've given it.

On the other hand, the game is *very* luck-driven, mostly due to the volatile nature of the conflicts. A very small difference in position (your opponent has three green tiles instead of just two, say) can result in massive swings of fortune.

While overcoming poor tile draws is interesting and challenging, the winner is usually the player who doesn't need to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is my all-time favorite game. It has an unusual combination of long term planning that must also be completely flexible. I had an unusual winning streak going for a while that netted me some deserved negative feelings, but I've lost now so you can stop making fun of me. *UPDATE* Clearly, this game has passed me by. After not having played it for over a year, I managed to finish dead last in the BGG.Con E&T Tournament. Any skills I may have once had have clearly flown out the window.

RATING: 8
I stayed away from this for a long time because it seemed dry and a little too abstract. Having played it I would say that it is more enjoyable than it first appeared.

Pure war between players.  You can't be nice in this game.  Conquer and destroy.  I have to reiterate the rules again and again, but if I label the red tiles as Political influence, then it's much easier to explain.  Goes well with Coffee and chocolate.  Then again everything does.

A you build, I take tile laying game. The concepts can be difficult to grasp in the first play, but soon clicks like all Knizia games. Vast feeling swings of control as others take kingdoms.

Missing components issue aside (Mayfair made the problem completely hassle free actually), this game might take me a little while to really appreciate.  This isn't discouraging though, since the games I tend to like the best are the ones I don't really like (understand) the first few times I play them.  I think this game could really shine if the same group of players learn to play it together and continue to improve at it as a group, since I could see more experienced players just trouncing the new ones.  Not a gateway game!

RATING: 8
Would be ranked higher, but the dry theme and complex design can be intimidating to players, stopping me from bringing this out as often as I'd like.  I really have no gripe with the design or rules in any way, aside from the very rare circumstance where a player gets a complete lack of red tiles.  Even this can be ~somewhat~ compensated for from what I've heard, though I've yet to see it.

a perfect example of a euro game that is of no interest to me.  the theme really has nothing to do with the game, and while scanning the board for a great move certainly requires skill, I'm not interested in working to gain that skill, and if I did, I suspect the game would then come down to who had the right amount of red tiles at the right moments.

When you're reading the rules to this, it sounds like it is a game of "holding your own empire" but all that changes when you realize other people might be pulling ahead of you just from the tiles they are getting.  This forces people to "invade" and things can get messy.  WARNING: Can lead to swearing and frustration when "your" stronghold quickly changes hands and forces you into conquest of your own!  Not just a simple tile laying game any more, is it...?  

I really like the point system of having your worst resource being your actual point total.  This keeps things honest and doesn't cater to someone who is just getting a whole lot of one color.  

Fun stuff!

I really like the changing dynamic of merging and unmerging kingdoms especially once the monuments are up. things can change quickly if some one can figure out were to break up a kingdom and where to unite two to their best advantage. I find there is a bit of "follow the leader" at the beginning, but then things open up a bit. A bit tough keeping track of the colours and symbols thing so it is not too easy to explain to everyone.

I know the game is highly rated but I'm not that keen.

Been playing this online at game table online and other places.  I own a copy but haven't played F2F yet.  This is a truly fantastic game, well deserving of all the praise here on BGG.  Its very deep and the strategy feels like an abstract, but the theme is surprisingly strong for a knizia.  The conflicts are a lot of fun, there is enough randomness to keep it interesting, and there is tension throughout the whole game.  It is a bit of a brain burner, so you have to play with people that don't get bogged down.  The more I play it the more I appreciate it.  

UPDATE:  now played face to face 6 times or so, and this is one of the most deep and engaging eurogames out there.  This game is crazy, chesslike, and insanely addictive.  If there could be only one...  this would be the top euro.  Beautiful game.

Update II:  tempted to rate this a 10.  Still an absolute blast!  Super deep, strategic, and interesting.  Games like this are the reason euros are popular, the massive amounts of VP-scoring shovelware shit out there can look up to this masterpiece.

I'm half tempted to get the new edition for the variants!

Edit:  Six years after the first rating....  played this again the other night, and you know what?  This game is still really awesome.

Tigris & Euphrates is a thrilling mix of gambling and strategy that pushes you to constantly adapt and improvise. Games build up and explode, and the challenge is to try to time the fuse just right to orchestrate the right mix of catalysts and capitalize maximally on the shards and pieces. It's is a game of conquest and usurpation, of building and trapping. 

The only problem with T&E is that it is over too damn quickly (~1 hour). It would be perfect if the game was 2 or 2.5 hours long. But at 1 hour or so the game's extreme intensity burns too quickly.

Earlier comment, which still holds true for me: 
While I am generally enthusiastic about games, I am a bit freaked out by just how much I enjoy this game. I think what is hooking me is the dramatic and slightly chaotic vibe that starts around the last 4-5 rounds in the game when all the kingdoms clash and the board changes in significant ways. The game builds and crescendos and it is packed with drama. I really can't believe that anyone would seriously call this game dry and mechanical. 

A great summation by BGG user [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3299475#3299475]Jambo[/url]: "T&E is a game of opportunism and short-term strategies. As an analogy, I'd say playing this is like a cobra about to strike - you have to wait for the right moment and when you do strike, strike hard making sure that your opponent is sufficiently crippled that they can't retaliate. Easier said than done."

SUGGESTION FOR NEW PLAYERS: While I don't normally like reading strategy articles, I'd actually recommend doing so with this game before you play your first game. The investment of time in advance will allow you to have quite a bit of fun with your very first game. Don't worry, there'll still be much to learn afterwards too.

This was a big disappointment.  This seems to be a popular game (which, to my own fault, is a big reason I made the purchase), but this is definitely not my cup of tea.

In fairness, we only played 3 games of it, but my wife absolutely hated it, and while my son and I did not share her exact feelings, we did not really enjoy it at all either.

It is a tile placing game (think Carcassonne), but I would much rather play Carcassonne than this game.  So, while 3 plays might not be entirely fair, none of us are interested enough to play more of this one.  There are simply many other games that are more interesting.

[Initial Impression:10]
I was hooked immediately, and this remains my favorite game - I love the variety of decisions, the tension of feeling like you can never get enough done in a turn, and watching the game board evolve over time.  Each player's turn can have small or tremendous consequences, depending on the situation, and trying to forsee those consequences provides enormous strategic depth. Games always seem to come down to the wire, and the game is fluid enough that even when one or more players believe they're out of it early on, they can remain in contention.

Well this game often called as Reiner Kinizia's masterpiece. This statement can be true as the game has very easy rules but with great depth wrapped around it. It is highly tactical with a lot of confrontation going everywhere on the board as fighting for the monuments for more points are essential to win. The twist is that vainly you can be the best from three colors but still finish in the last place. This is a modern classic which was created in 1997 but after all it is still a great game nowadays.

RATING: 8
Played it once and was confused... and so were the other players at the table. The person introducing the game did a good job for the time she took, but the game is confusing to new people because of the lack of a player aid that organizes the rules. The game isn't hard to understand, it's just that the whole time we were saying "uhhh oh yeah internal conflicts are red, lol whoops"

Not a big problem after your first play, and I am not rating this game from my learning experience. I am rating it for what I think it would potentially be if I kept playing it.

And I give it a solid 8. I like that it has depth, in that you have many decisions and areas you can affect. If you think about it, you have a LOT of decisions! 

The major downer of the game is that it has little interaction with other players. I could be playing this game online with 3 other people, never talking to them, and I think I would have the same experience. Maybe if I revisited the game and tried to take on a more diplomatic role, this game would be more fun... so I am eager to try this game again and rethink my score of 8.

There are a lot of neat mechanisms with conflicts at hand, but I hate how conflicts pretty much decide the game.  The ideal is to sneaky wins through external conflicts for maximum points.  Turtling can't help a whole lot, and avoiding conflict won't get you enough points.  The game isn't much different each time you play.  If we were going to play a conflict game, I'd rather play something lighter like Cosmic Encounter, or hunker down with Twilight Imperium.  Both games are fun to play even when losing, and provide more come-back options.  This can be a satisfying play if in the right mood with the right people but otherwise a bit of a drag.  If I want something dry, I'll opt for something like Container or Power Grid: Factory Manager.  Not worth keeping around for me anymore.

Only played once or twice, but I really like this so far and defintely see it rising in the future.

Raised this to a 7.5 after trying Gamegrunt's 2-player modifications- these greatly tighten the game flow, making it both faster and more head-to-head.

The game itself is almost abstract in it's activities, but the way in which it plays out, and the Knizian struggle to excel in all areas (possibly originated in this game?) make it a challenge to play well every time.

A classic Eurogame, in the best sense.

A great game for 3 or 4 players, intent on taking each other's civilizations out of the picture.

And the fun thing is, that rarely matters in this game.  Once you've laid out your tiles and scored for them, there is very little reason to protect 'your' civilization from other players.

In fact, the biggest realization that dawns after a few games is that the game position is not represented on the board, but behind the player's screens in actual score.

Once you realize this, any sentimentality over kingdoms melt away and oppertunism rears its beautiful head.

The weakest of Reiner's games, although it is one of the loveliest.  The game suffers from having too much to do and not enough to do it with: other games get away with this, but this game suffers for it.

Typical Reiner game where there's lots of math concepts and your score is the area in which you are doing the poorest at. This was really hard to pick up from the original rules, so you may need to watch a game first. That said, a very good abstract still.

RATING: 8
This, and Aquire are two games where scoring seems counter intuitive.  I explain that you are collecting "sets of 4 colors" and that seems to help new players.  However, how to score points is somewhat difficult to explain to newbies.  I like the mechanism that you don't "own" a color, and how switching control of cities can surprize new players.  However, the theme is a little dry and the game is only attractive to a small number of my play group.

My taste in games tends to correlate fairly well with the BGG public, if there is such a thing, so the question is why it is that I dislike T&E so much? I have two guesses: 1) I tend to dislike tile-laying games, 2) too much direct conflict for me. I prefer games that are, well, more passive-aggressive. (That is not a reflection of my personality. No, really!)

Regardless of what many will tell you, I find this game to be choke full of theme. IMO, the reason why many people find this game hard to teach is that they don't use the theme effectively. I really enjoy T&E's confrontation dynamics: Different forces make you want to be both the attacker and the defender in a conflict. Deciding when and how to start a conflict in T&E is one of the most interesting decisions you'll have to make in a game.

RATING: 8
This is a real brain-burner. Well, at least the first time we tried to play it, trying to figure out the rules. Typical, poorly written rules from Knizia that are confusing (e.g. Ra, Samurai) at best. Yet, this is a genius of game design. I am continually amazed at how Knizia comes up with these unique game mechanics which are so simple, yet so profound.

Update (07/16/09): Played it again twice in one evening, after not playing it in over a year. It's a lot easier having the rules explained to you instead of trying to figure it out from reading the rules (and having played it before F2F and with the computer game). The play is much quicker, although it comes to a crawl near the end with thinking about all the various conflicts that could happen. The game is brutal, and a newbie can easily throw the game in someone's favor. It's not a perfect information game, however, due to the hidden tiles, but if equally matched in skill, this game could play like chess. This means it requires some investment to play well, and as a social experience, leaves something to be desired. Regardless, I'm upping it to an '8' from a '7'. It's growing on me.

This game is fin to play. It is a lot like Ingenious, but is still a lot of fun. It is perfect for the whole family and many people will enjoy the warlike strategy involved. make sure you know the difference between your farmers and traders before you start this game and make sure that you know how the rules work. This game could work better is the pieces that are removed from the board go back in the bag, instead of becoming dead pieces.

Finally, I have bought this game.  This is often regarded as Knizia's finest hour, and it is easy to see why.  The current edition comes with a double sided board which is apparently "harder", but I suspect it will be a while until I feel the need to try it.  At the moment, the main question I have is "is the random selection of tiles likely to skew the game significantly with experienced players?".  I look forward to answering this question over time.

Update: I must only have played this a dozen times so I am still a relative beginner, but my enjoyment is marred with the random tile draws much more than with, for example, Samurai.  The game is more complicated and has some nice asymmetries, but I just don't find it any more rewarding.  Plus, I now own [thing=24508][/thing]...

I cannot explain exactly why but I have disliked all my games of this. I just cannot see why this is treated with such reverence on the Geek. The strategy / tactics are at the mercy of the tile draws and other players inadvertent actions. You can effectively be out early on but still have to play on etc. etc. At least it is short :)

I enjoy this game.  It is really a confrontational game and thus needs to be played with people who can take that.  I played with my son and he got angry with me when I moved into his region.  If you are really into heavy confrontational games, you will love this game.  There is a lot of depth and strategy involved.  I rate it a "7" rather than anything higher because it is not really my kind of game.  I appreciate the genius of it.  I will play it and enjoy playing it, but I would much rather be playing a game like Reef Encounter, which is a similar, but much better and more creative implementation of this type of play. - - - - Having now played Reef Encounter a bunch of times, my recommendation is to get Reef Encounter instead of Tigris and Euphrates.  It is a much better implementation of the same type of mechanics, with a few extra twists thrown in to make it more fun.  I've now traded away this game because I would never choose to play T & E over Reef Encounter, which I rate a "10" and is one of my favorite games.

Whew!  What a game...after playing it for the first time, I have played it a total of 6 within a week.  The interplay between leaders and civilization tiles allows a multitude of strategies and tactics.  Should you pursue a kingdom composed of only your own leaders?  Should you latch on to another players kingdoms?  Do you fortify against Internal conflicts? External conflicts?  And all the while attempting to maintain a balanced scoring attack, as your ultimate score for the game is the lowest score you post.  A Classic.

I have mixed feelings about this one due to some odd player interactions.  In our last game, player A launched an ill-advised attack against player B, which ended up giving player B a commanding lead.

I'm afraid I prefer games in which players who make poor choices lose, rather than make some particular other player win.

I appreciate the design and complexity to the game, when I got the game it was the #1 game on the geek before Puerto Rico came along. I bought it purely b/c of that at the time. It's a little too dry for my friends though and I rarely can convince them to play it. Often ownership of the cities becomes an issue and some people have an illogical need to "build up their city" which is not how the game plays.(ideally you need to be more fluid than that not just trying to make monuments) Good game but rarely understood or played.

Tigris and Euphrates is one of only a handful of games that I really hated on first playing, but I've warmed to it to some extent by playing the iOS version. It's a highly tactical and opportunistic game of building kingdoms and taking them to war. In spite of being a heavy game, there's still a substantial luck of the draw element in which tiles you get and the chaos factor can be huge as the kingdoms merge and break apart. There can be a nasty feeling of frustration in the conflict resolution, getting your leaders knocked off the board in midgame can lead to a spiral of defeat and weakness that's impossible to recover from. It's this that gives the game a 'bad experience' feel and with tight scoring, a few tiles either way can decide the game. The combination of rules heaviness with the random elements makes this a gaming oddball in my view, and as an initial sceptic, I fully sympathise with those who "don't get it". If you want a probability-based conflict game, Backgammon has fewer rules and less playing time, but my view of T&E has grown the more I've played it.

This is a pretty deep game and there is a real ebb and flow to it as civilizations rise and fall.  It's largely about opportunism (leaching points out of other people's civilizations or attacking them at the right moment) but you can gain plenty of points by holing up with your monuments somewhere too.  I feel like there are far more layers to this than I will ever get to unravel, but it's certainly interesting. (3 plays)

Beautiful tactical abstract mechanic.. little in the way of long term strategy however as board positions vary greatly from one turn to the next.  You basically think of what is your best move for that turn only. Game loses a couple of marks as it suffers a bit from brain paralysis. 

Had to downgrade due to difficulty in getting others to play this system.  Although it matters what you personally think of a system, it also matters on the frequency in which you get to play it.

Love this game.  The game mechanics are fairly simple once you've played, but it always seems difficult to explain to new players.  It always moves pretty quickly which is nice, and I can't think of another game like it.  It's not quite perfect, but it's a heck of a lot of fun.

Seems like it ought to be good, but I've tried a few times to focus on the game enough to wrap my brain around it, and never quite succeeded.  At this point it's a game I feel like I ought to enjoy, rather than one I actually do enjoy.  A guilty non-pleasure, I suppose. (Update Jan 2011: Played again and sort of liked it. Maybe it's time to try again.)

El JUEGO con mayúsculas del genial Knizia que debe jugarse muchas veces para apreciarlo como se merece (al contrario que Puerto Rico o Power Grid, que me aburren más conforme más juego). Clásco moderno de gran profundidad, comparable a la de los grandes abstractos. Muy, muy reflexivo. Genialidad absoluta el sistema de puntuación que obliga a desarrollar distintas estrategias en cada partida. Buen punto a su favor la mecánica de "los reinos no son de un único jugador". El azar presente no es determinante para ganar. Contras: Prácticamente compites contra ti mismo (ingnoras la puntuación ajena). Abstracto con reglas complicadas para ser un abstracto

[ENG]

It´s the Knizia´s GAME (with capital letters) that should be played many times to appreciate as it deserves, unlike Power Grid o Puerto Rico, that became boring with more plays. It´s a modern classic brainburning game at the same level of other great abstract games like. Extremely reflexive game. The system of scoring VP is genius becouse it obligates you to develop several strategies in each game. The mechanic "the kingdoms are not of the same player" is one of the most interesting ideas of the design. The randomness of the game does not determine who´s the winner. DRAWBACKS: Actually, you´re in a competition against yourself, becouse you can ignore the other´s scores. It´s an abstract game with fiddly rules to be an abstract.

RATING: 8.5
Lots of depth and clearly benefits of multiple plays.  Scoring your least dominant color is a fantastic mechanic and drives you to change your focus throughout the game.  Abstract, tile-placing may be too dry for many people.

RATING: 3
I dont get why so many people rate this game so highly??? In essence it feels like it should be great but the luck of the draw from the bag stops you making choices you want to. I won the last time we played by such a margin it was rediculous, just because my oponents never drew the tiles they needed.

RATING: 8
Gioco estremamente astratto, impegnativo ma affascinante. Impossibile capirlo subito, è più complesso di molti altri della stessa categoria. Richiede attenzione e una notevole capacità di saper leggere la partita, riuscendo ad ottimizzare al massimo le proprie mosse. L’estrazione casuale delle tessere, lo rende, a mio avviso, un gioco più tattico che strategico. Geniale il meccanismo di calcolo dei punteggi, simile a quello di Samurai, dello stesso Knizia.

Enjoyed this one a bit! It's got a lot more strategy to it then it first seems when your finished reading the rules.  One game down and I'm pretty sure the rating will go up with more plays as I learn how the game works.

After a few plays now I see the strategies and some of the intricacies. Up to 7.5 from 7.

First played this on Jan 29th 2007.  As the rules were being explained I was feeling overwhelmed with the nuances with the rules.  During game play things started making sense and I made a few mistakes that turned out to be great plays.  There is a big of luck to this game with the tiles chosen at the right time, however there is obviously enough strategy as well to make this a fun game.  This is worth a few game plays and add to the rotation of games to play on a regular basis.

Great area control game.  Highly interactive without totally destroying the position of other players (very very fluid control mechanism).  Very nice slick mechanics, easy to understand, but deep mind grinding quality.  Kinzia at his best (and I don't say that often).

RATING: 10
Great Game!!  The counters take a little getting used to because the symbols signify what leaders are yours and the colors are the type of leaders.  Rules are medium-heavy but the once you play a few rounds you understand them. Once you have the rules down you can start thinking of strategy and this is where the real game begins. 

Played at FLGS and I can't wait to play again.

I was always intimadated by games like this when I saw the category of weight they were thrown into.  I find 'weight' to be a bit of a misnomer now since the game seems very simple to me.  Indeed there are many interesting considerations to make when placing a move, even more so given the player interaction, but the game is little more than a confrontational abstract game with some tricky tactics.  I did enjoy it, however, and found its length to be just about perfect.

After a couple plays I'm beginning to enjoy this one more.  It really is open ended, and the hidden information makes for a tense experience.  The multiple sources of scoring are icing on the cake.

Apr 08: Has really grown on me over time.  I just put together a nice copy of the 2-player Nile map.  Need to give that a go.

Wonderful abstract games, better than other titles of Reiner's which i played. Many alternative ways, changing conditions, dynamic map, tensed decisions. It is a great abstract and doesnt feel old. I like the combat mechanism but it may frustrate you sometimes, still wars and revolts are mostly be used to block your opponents.

As Christopher Bartlett (cc_TheToph) wrote: "Everything that is wonderful, and everything that is terrible about German games in one box."  I basically agree with this.  It's wonderful to play, but afterwards there's nothing to remember fondly about.  "hahaha remember that time when I played a red tile and that gave me the one point I needed for the win.  Good times."

Another thing that I find surprising, is that on BBG most Euros players seem to hate luck in their games.  In T&E, however, the game is almost completely dependent on luck (tiles drawn out of the bag).  Since you have to give up an action to discard your hand, if you have a bad set of tiles, you are in a severe disadvantage because of the Reiner Scoring (tm) system (winner is the highest of the lowest).

I am incredibly impressed with this game. I had put off playing it because it sounded incredibly dry.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Given the time to play and interested opponents, I would choose this over every single game that I've tried so far.  To all those out there who were put off at the thought of another tile-laying game do not despair.  This one is different and often exciting.  Having now played both a few times, I have difficulty understanding how this is rated below Puerto Rico.  PR is good, but not great.  This game is great.

After 14 plays I've decided not to play it ever again.
It's just way too random compared to the length of the game.  Given more time you can counter bad luck, but not in a game lasting ~1h.

4 players is the worst number - you get too few turns and can do too little to turn around the bad fortune.  Maybe with 2-3 players it's slightly better (don't rememeber; I haven't played in such a mode for a long time), but it's not MUCH better...

Rating down from original 9 to 5.

RATING: 9.5
An excellent strategy game with lots of interaction, it is a little tricky to learn but quite accessible, be sure to play a few times before passing judgement (It might take that many for everything to click). Lots of interesting strategy in this game that still intrigues after double digit plays. The theme seemed a little weak at first to me and it did seem a little dry in an abstract chess-like way but after more playings you do get the sense of civilizations rising and falling and the aftershocks of such ordeals. Watching and shaping the developing board is fascinating in a way that few other games capture and the anticipation of the coming conflicts really get your strategy juices flowing. More plays and a comparison to reef encounter to see which I might buy...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 9 Rating went up and could more. This is really a "gamers" game and not one to teach the faint of heart. Some depth here and maybe his deepest along with TAJ. The scoring is very good and of course balanced as is the game play, it really goes without saying I think. Very challenging game and easy to overlook something as there is lots going on, 3 or 4 players would really be somewhat chaotic until you had a really firm grasp of the game. This is a classic to be sure even if a little dry, I'm not sure the wife will like it though. Still needs more plays...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] More plays FTF now and the wife is not crazy about it yet and she likes almost every game she plays, 3 games more with 2 people only, I believe 3 will be the sweet spot so I can't wait to try 3 and 4. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Played with 3 and while it was a great number the tile draw was horrible, one guy had all red and another none all game. This better not happen often...

I'm not sure I see the rating going above 9 now as the luck could be a tad higher than I like spoiling the occasional game. Another note, doesn't seem to be a very wife friendly game for some reason...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 9 => 9.5 Guess what, it finally grew on the wife as she realized the brilliance of how the game develops and how dynamic the game is, it also doesn't hurt that she is good at it as well. Out of 20 games only one was really bad due to the tile draw (no red which is the worst) albeit the tiles can dictate your strategy but that is part of the beauty here, it forces you to slightly adapt on the fly not being too dependant on one strategy and to look for creative ways to gain cubes in your weakest colour. An excellent amount of depth versus game time here just like Taj, we knock this off in an hour, LOVE this game.

RATING: 8
It is still one of my favorite games, but other players may have found a "perfect strategy" playing here on-line.  It seems that if you can cluster your leaders around a single treasure laden red space south of the Southern river and then build a monument, you have an excellent shot at victory.  By the time anyone can get enough reds to kick you out or a strong enough empire to win an external victory it may be too late. 

Still it is one of my desert island games.

Elke speler heeft een leider in elke kleur (rood: priester, blauw: boer, groen: handelaar; zwart: koning) waarmee hij een volk kan leiden (en punten in die kleur kan krijgen voor elke fiche in die kleur die in het koninkrijk bijkomt, of voor elk monument in die kleur in dat koninkrijk). Twee leiders van dezelfde kleur in een koninkrijk leidt tot een intern conflict (meeste rode tempels wint); twee leiders in verschillende koninkrijken die worden samengevoegd door het plaatsen van een fiche leidt tot een extern conflict (meeste fiches van die kleur in oorspronkelijk koninkrijk wint). Groene leiders kunnen schatten verzamelen; i.e. witte blokjes die als joker kunnen dienen. Het spel eindigt wanneer alle fiches opstaan (je vult steeds bij tot zes achter je scherm) of wanneer er aan het einde van een beurt nog maar een of twee schatten op het bord staan. Om de winnaar te bepalen kijkt elke speler naar de kleur waarin hij het minst heeft gescoord; de sterkste wint. De grafische vormgeving in deze oude versie is wat flets, maar het spel zelf is super strategisch en zit geweldig goed in elkaar.

A game i loved and finally got to purchase.Just alot going on in this one and love the conflict and strategy involved.Not really a hard game with a lot of rules but just a deep game as you try to figure out the best way to get points in your lowest color.

I was pleasantly surprised by this. After being underwhelmed by Samurai and somewhat lukewarm on Ra, I figured this had no chance. But it was pretty compelling. In particular it was easier than I expected to get into. I hear it get compared to abstracts a lot, and I usually don't like abstracts because I feel like you can't really learn to play the game just by playing and I don't care to study a game. But it seems like you can pick this up fairly quickly just by playing it. And there are definite decisions and tradeoffs and all the things I expect out of a good game. I know this sounds like I'm saying it's good because it doesn't do anything wrong, and that feels like an odd thing to say, but I can't quite put my finger on what makes this game special, but I feel like there is such a thing to this game. Though I wonder how much its rating was helped by my low impression of the designer going in.

RATING: 10
One of my all time favorite games. People say the theme is thin, but I disagree. Mechanically maybe so, but I certainly feel like I am an ancient king stretching my influence and waiting for the right moment to topple someone's kingdom. Right length, right weight, right amount of confrontation. Knizia is a genius.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A decent, albeit quiet, puzzler masquerading as a semi-war game with Knizia's great scoring twists that cause real problems for a player's domination strategy in one area. Scoring incentives are key to the theme (which, ultimately, is paper-thin).

RATING: 8
This has stood the test of time and over 200 plays for me. Anything over 10 plays for me would have to be a winner already, this is an absolute top shelf game. It can be a real brain buster at times but that's why I love it! It's Knizia's best game, I think most wouldn't argue with that too much. Yes, there involves some luck with the tiles draws, but this game is otherwise all strategy and tactics but you play to the odds. This is not a light game nor is it extremely heavy and there is a bit of a learning curve that will be overcome after a few games; but it's absolutely worth the effort! IMHO this plays best with 3 players, each player has a little room to grow before battles begin. Four-player games tend to be crowded, players are often forced into battle a little too early. Two-player games are the bloodiest, there are constant back and forth conflicts with the winner of the first battle usually coming out on top. If you don't have this, you need to try this ASAP and lucky for you it can be played right here on the geek for free! Give it try then go out and buy!

**UPDATE** I've played this game a LOT, 200 times here online alone! It's getting a little...old. I took a while off from playing it, came back and played about 10 games and quickly got tired of it again. It's like hearing Thiller on the radio, used to love it but nowadays...? *flips station*

RATING: 10
Great. A bit too dry and heavy, a true classic in my bookshelf. A very solid game though. Reiner Knizia's masterpiece. This is a 2 to 4 player tile laying game, where players build up kingdoms of tiles on the board, and try to position their leaders to their best advantage. The game is won by taking cubes in four colours, but your score is the colour you have the least of. Ingenious mechanics and subtle deep game play. Simply wonderful. Buy it now.

Sacrilege, I'm sure, giving this a 6. But the few experiences I've had playing it weren't that fun. No one has finished a game saying, "let's play that again!" I can see the elegance in the mechanics, but the actual gameplay was dry for us.

GREAT mechanics, HORRIBLE theme (totally irrelevant and pasted on).  Can't we make a law that bans giving completely misleading titles to games?  Typical Knizia--totally abstract & dry, but great system.  I despise this game personally but have to respect the depth and begrudingly admit it's a good fit for other gamers.  But it should just be called Red Blue Green Black.  There is no feel of any conflict or civilization whatsoever, and there is a fair chunk of luck involved.  Basically, if theme is important at all to you do NOT play this, you'll hate it.  But if you like unique and balanced mechanics and don't mind the totally abstract and mathematical, this could be for you.  Just bein' honest...

RATING: 8
Edging out Lost Cities for my favorite Reiner Knizia game, Tigris & Euphrates contains some relatively simple mechanics that lead to tough decisions and exciting tactical play. It seems like every mechanic is interesting, whether it be the differences in the two forms of combat, the unique powers (both obvious and subtle) of each leader, the formation of monuments, or scoring only the lowest number of points, each mechanic somehow meshes together to create a unique gameplay experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This was my first real Euro after learning Settlers.  It was my #1 game, and my only 10, for a long while.  I've dropped its rating a bit, since I find that I'd rather play other games in the same genre.  (UR, for example.)

Another thing preventing it from hitting the table is that I prefer to play it with four, but there aren't four people in my game group who like it enough to all want to play it at the same time.  So, it rarely hits the table anymore.

Very deep and heavy strategy game.  Not intended for non-gamers.  Learning curve & strategy curve are very steep.  This game takes a long time to play, so it gets played less often than Settlers.  Turns don't take a long time since you only get 2 actions.  The game mechanics actually encourage interaction and conflict, which is a huge plus for me.  The scoring system is very unique, and each game so far has played out differently.  Highly recommended for any abstract strategy fan.

The reputed learning curve on this one scared me off for awhile, especially after trying it once through the iOS tutorial.  But I watched a couple of reviews and the "how to play" videos and then gave it another shot.  It was great.  (I won my next iPad game, but then got crushed by the better AI player because I neglected monuments.)  I'm sure it takes a lot to beat a skilled player, but there's just a small initial hump between newbies and intelligent play.  Watch the videos, go ahead and play without the tutorial, and before you finish a game, the differences between internal and external conflicts will make perfect sense (it's good to think of them, as the How To Play video suggests, as "revolutions" and "wars").

The mechanics are near-genius. On the other hand, it is the type of game which encourages "silent play" (like in chess) where everyone thinks and is all serious. And it's WAY too much abstract for me.

Build kingdoms in ancient Mesopotamia. Possibly my favorite German-style game overall. The game is quite abstract, but for some reason the theme clicks with me anyway. The game also has that "constructive" feel, ie. you get to build/develop stuff, no matter whether you win or not (a game feature I am very fond of), and finally, gameplay is just extraordinary, with a fine balance of development, nasty tricks, and outright warfare. The luck "level" seems just right for me too.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (August 2010)

Tigris & Euphrates is a good game, there is no question about it, however, I almost never want to play it.

The game components are very good and they look great on the table.

The theme doesn’t excite me, but you don´t feel it through the game anyway (as most Knizia´s games).

The rules of the game aren’t complex, but the internal and external conflicts can be confusing at first. You can explain the rules under 20 minutes with examples. Game length is over 2 hours.

Best with 4 players, but it scales very well from 2 to 4 players. 

There is a healthy dose of luck in the game, I’m still undecided if the luck factor is uncontrollable or not, but I feel whoever got the most red tiles has an unfair advantage.

I liked it better when Mr. Knizia designed heavy games. I have disliked most (if not all) of his newer lighter games. I miss his old self :/.

Bottom line, I should love the game, but for some inexplicable reason, I never want to play Tigris & Euphrates. For now, It is a 5.5 for me. It is a game I respect, but that doesn’t grab me.

Current Rating: 5.5

RATING: 8
Draw a hand of tiles in four types. Each type supports a different one of the four leader types. Each player as one each of the leaders, but the tiles are shared/competed for on the board. Leader fights leader in "majority support wins" conflicts.

An excellent mix of engineering strategy and tactics, but having to steer your tactics according to your tile draw. A game that take some people a while to "get", since it's easy to get stuck in thinking of "my kingdom" and "your kingdom" which (a) closes many of possible directions of play and (b) substantially reduces the interaction and involvment of the game.

It's a more intense game than I want to play every week, but it's superb.

RATING: 8
It's very good. It may move up to a 9 with more play, but it could drop a slight bit too.

It's a pretty balanced and fluid game. I would not be surprised to hear complaints about the tile draws affecting the game and your play (I've cursed the tiles more than once!); this is true, but it's a lot like poker in feel to me, over time, it'll even out. 

The tiles do affect the game and they have too, it's the main motivator for change and action in the game, it's what creates the fluid nature and the obstacles all games need (obstacles make any game). You must be nimble and able to accept the fog-of-war the tiles bring to the game. 

The only time I can see the tiles strongly influencing the game is in the balance of reds and the impact your drawing luck has on rebellions (internal conflicts); I say this because the maximum on board defense you can have prepared for a rebellion against one of your leaders is 4 red tiles laid out in what I call the 'crucifix' (your leader on the cross). 

If you have no reds in hand when a rebellion strikes, you're hosed. Now, is that a bad thing for the game? A valid question and up to your opinion, but I see it as an intentional design of the game. It's clear that rebellions are meant to be damaging as there are 57 red tiles (20+ more than the rest of the colors); you are intended to rebel. This is important to note and it's to stop run-away games (along with the scoring method forcing balance). If the game were solely based upon external conflicts you would eventually get unassailable kingdoms by good players. 

You can build extremely solid empires with strong supply lines and board positioning. The positioning of a kingdom is huge in the ability to storm it (think of castle building positions in real life and you'll be thinking along my lines). Without a rebellion threat, these solidly built kingdoms can be neigh on impossible to storm. Rebellions (cultural revolutions, red book storming) provide a constant threat and opportunity. The higher count of red in the draw pile gives an average pay out over time (not necessarily in a particular game) and should allow you to at least have a couple of opportunities to punch back (though you may not win).

Now, even if that's not the case in a single game, you will have many chances to keep in the game depending on how you build and manage. I make no claims that you can always recover, you can't, but you will have options.

"Tigris and Euphrates" requires some willingness to be bold and strike when you're not certain you can win and sometimes the best strategy may not pan out due to the Fates and the fog-of-war. Boys and Girls, that's a fact of war...sometimes things go wrong or your timing is just off.

I can see a strong Poker influence in 'Tigris and Euphrates' and I can strongly see how it relates to wargames (yet, isn't one). This is a nebulous point here and I'm not sure how to state it, but it's about supply lines and cohesiveness in your kingdoms...It's about avoiding separations AND YET at times intentionally creating your own losses to break a kingdom for a follow up thrust.

"Tigris and Euphrates" is a very good game. I'll be curious to see how it develops for me and if I come to any firm resolutions on it. I'm still thinking about opening positions and I have some thoughts there (it could become static in standard openings, but the actual game play will vary greatly) and I'll have to play it with more players, but I like it so far. 

I took to the understanding of the game fairly quick, but I don't make a case that I'm dangerous or mighty in it--as I'm not, I'm kind of pathetic so far. :laugh:

I must confess that I'd avoided it for a long time (something just didn't appeal to me by looking at the box) but I finally bought it in a mad flurry of purchasing. I'm glad to have it and I'm glad the 'Geek has it online to play as it may be hard to get people to take a crack at it; this will depend greatly upon your group's tastes and reasons for gathering together for a game--so, pay attention to your group and who might like a more involved session. this is not hard to teach really, but my gaming background (and GameMastering) history probably skews my view.

I'm very glad that Jimzik (fellow 'Geek) invited me into my first ever game. It was a good time and I really thank him for it. I actually held up longer than I thought and hope that I was, at least, respectable in my showing.

I'm going to develop this writing out as a separate article and will shorten this entry at that time.

OK, two (ftf) plays in twenty years and I finally get this - why did I wait so long?

In an era when the same set of Eurogame mechanisms get endlessly recycled in an whirl of themeless, interaction-free, forgettable same-as-it-ever-was points engine generators it's refreshing to contemplate how simple yet razor-edged this game was, and remains.

Boiled-down, competitive (at times brutal) Eurogaming at its best. Multiplayer solitaire this is not.

- The SU&SD "good move" review sums this one up really.
- The theme does work, but really it's an abstract game.
- I really like that on your turn you can do two actions. It's just enough to do stuff, but really you often want/need a third. Great game design.
- Heaps of player interaction. This isn't a game where you can win (realistically) by doing your own thing. You need to get up into peoples' grills.
- The scoring mechanism is great as it forces players to interact and change-up what they're doing regularly through the game.
- Despite the last couple of points, it's easy to become attached to one's creation, fighting to maintain control over it, when really you should just let it go while you fight over someone else's empire.
- Plays great with all player counts, but with 2 it's neck and neck. Love it!
- Teaching is not hard at all. The game has simple rules. The problem for new players is that it's not obvious what to do, and it's hard to remember the main mechanisms at first because they are so abstract.

My preference is for the Mayfair edition... the original German edition is "too busy".  And, the rules for scoring could have been worded differently (why not just say that you have to collect sets of colours?)

At one time I rated this game higher, but I've dropped it to a 6.  I still enjoy playing, but the "shine" has worn off... there is definitely too much luck in the tile draws.  

I don't mind luck in most games, but the person who draws the right tiles at the right time in this game is going to win nine times out of ten.

Luck will tend to even out over the course of a few games, but sitting for almost 2 hours and only ever drawing 5 red tiles can be very frustrating.

I am looking to buy the new Euro edition with variant mapboard.

Admittedly, the scoring mechanic is clever and works great.  Some of the colored attack mechanics are interesting and allows for great decision making/interaction, however, I simply don't see the appeal.

I much prefer the good doctor's more recent Ingenious.  Both are abstracts that offer the same great scoring mechanic but Ingenious is much less complicated and plays about 30-45 minutes faster.

I have played many more times than recorded.  It is brilliant, it gives opportunity for very cunning play, but it is a little too abstract for my taste, a little too violent for my playing group (i.e., the family), and I tire of explaining the difference between internal and external conflicts.

My favorite boardgame so far.

It plays differently, but oddly, I could write the same comments than for the game Manhattan.

The genious idea of this game is the scoring system. Players secretly accumulate points in four different categories, and when players reveal their final score at the end of the game, they compare the amount they achieved in the category where they have the lowest number of points !

Very good game with interesting decisions to make.  You might not feel like you're truly expanding a 3000 B.C. Mesopotamian empire, but you'll be engaged in every turn.  Double-sided 2008 board adds more replayability to a game that already has more than enough replayability.  As UvulaBob said, external conflicts can be bloody.

Excellent game.  I never seem to do all that well, but there is a lot of meat to this one.  All sorts of strategies are possible. Of course, if you draw nothing but red and blue tiles the entire game, you'll have no strategy.  So, don't do that.

Tigris & Euphrates is a deep game with robust strategy and a high level of interaction, especially for the brief play time. The rules seem a bit counterintuitive at first, but once you get your mind around them, it flows well. A challenging game to master that offers high repeat playability. This game contains one of the most brilliant scoring mechanisms in any game I've seen. There is a limited audience for this one, but it deserves its status as a classic.

Still somewhat opaque, although I did win my second game by a nose after getting dominated early on. The problem is, I'm not quite sure how I managed to make the comeback. 

I'm glad I tried it a second time, because I sort of had a clue of what to try as the game went on. Still, I think I *generally* prefer more thrills and action than this has to offer. Promised Donovan I would bump this up, but this is probably as far as it'll go.

I love this game. I remember learning it probably 15 years ago and being clueless. and frustrated. But I suppose one mark of a good game for me is that it is difficult to master.

T&E is one of those rare games with absolutely perfect mechanics. The rules sound confusing when reading them, but make perfect sense while playing. And this is real fun too (as long as you like abstract area control games). I like a bit of randomness in my games for tactical variation and this game hits the sweet spot - not too much randomness, but just enough.

The more I play this game, the more I like it. Lots of strategies are possible, lots of decisions to make, and the lowest VP total mechanic is pretty cool.

Grande, cada día me gusta más como juego, además puesto sobre la mesa y avanzada la partida queda muy bonito.

Juego tenso donde los haya, en el que la colocación de las losetas en el tablero no hace otra cosa que generarte preocupación porque tus rivales no vengan a por ellas.

Tiene un puntito que es virtud y defecto, y es la interacción, que es alta. Cualquier cosa que hagas sobre el tablero se va a ver reflejada en los demás. Esto es un pro a la hora de planificar tu estrategia, pero un contra porque provoca un alto factor "kingmaker", y alguien sin querer, puede arruinarle la partida a otro jugador.

I imagine we're all on the same page here, but here's the "last time, on BGG" voiceover for you anyway. T&E is Reiner Knizia's highest ranked game. It's the oldest game in the top 10. It was #1 prior to the release of PR in 2002. It is rated a perfect 10 by both of the site owners and can be played in the forums here on BGG. It also has a reputation for being a "bolt from the blue" as far as game design goes. My geekbuddy analysis shows comments like "crazy-unique" and "game-god made flesh." It is well known for being strategically opaque and counterintuitive yet smooth-flowing and engrossing. The game's thematic integration polarizes players into those who see a pure positional abstract, and those who see the ebb and flow of civilizations. Etc.

OK, so I finally played the game, and what I found was the supreme development of Sid Sackson's 1962 classic, [thing=5][/thing]. There's no memory element (for those of you who play Acquire with closed shares), but the basic premise is intact: add tiles to [-]hotels[/-] kingdoms, position yourself as a stakeholder in these kingdoms, and maneuver such that when two kingdoms [-]merge[/-] collide, you score points. The thing is, in Acquire, tiles are permanent and the hotels glom onto each other, eventually forming super-duper hotels in one giant tile-blob. Conflicts in T&E are multi-step because each Kingdom may have up to four "dimensions" (various elements of civilization: agriculture, religion, etc.), and the resolution of each conflict will remove one or more pieces from the board, segmenting and re-segmenting the kingdoms. Thus, "ebb and flow." 

I think it's a very good game that requires repeat play to get into. To keep it from becoming straight-up multi-player chess, Knizia included both hidden information (you have a hand of six tiles - just like acquire) and a not-small dose of randomness via the tile draw. During conflicts, you may play tiles from your hand to influence the outcome, and on your turn, you may use an action to discard all of your tiles and draw new ones. In other words, tiles are drawn frequently enough that it's not uncommon to randomly have three or four of one type, and that could really save you if the right situation arises on the board. I won my first game of T&E because I had three black tiles during a 5-2 attack. The back-blast against my opponent gave me 6 points in my second-lowest color, just as I was setting up to score big in my lowest. I won with 9-9-9-11. 

I think the tile-draw is always going to seem "one step too far" to players, as far as including an element of chance. I don't think it ruins it though. The other easy criticism of this game is that external conflicts heavily reconfigure the board such that you have to discard your last three minutes of planning and take another three minutes before proceeding. The 2hr playing time comes entirely from the "need a new plan" syndrome. 

Personally, I think anyone who is new to gaming should avoid T&E unless they're predisposed to like more abstract and positional games. It's a must-try once you're a "gamer."

Abstract, brain burning, great! Eurogames aren't made like this anymore and if they were I would doubt that they could be succesful with worker placement and combo- / deck-building being the name of the game. T&E offers a wealth of options that only are revealed with experience. It's a game of positional play and preparing your attack. You better have a master plan what you're doing... and a Plan B as the actions of other players can alter the state of play dramatically. It's similar here to games like Indonesia or Chicago Express that inexperienced players can completely turn the game with an unthoughtful decision.

Eminently satisfying though fairly chaotic game, This is a true Euro but should appeal to those who enjoy direct conflict and some randomness in their games. T&E owes more than a little to Sackson's classic Acquire but surpasses that earlier game in a number of ways, not least of which being the fact that one is scored on his or her weakest color, which forces a balancing act throughout the game. The rules are a bit complicated, but they shouldn't be much of an obstacle after a few plays; trying it out and making mistakes seems to me the best way to learn.

I really like this game a lot. The way the winner is decided is simply great and the hidden-scoring adds a nice factor of mystery. Even more important for me, though, is the fun involved in continuous searching for ways to attack other players. I think this is great even when lady luck's not on your side. You'll just have to play to your own strengths, i.e. not whine about getting bad tiles but trying to be creative with them. It's extremely rare to get just bad tiles all the way through a play. Also works fine with 2 players. And what comes to the theme, I think it's quite strong.

RATING: 5
A little bit too much tile luck but still a very good game.

After several more plays I have decided that it is not for me. I don't mind playing occationally but it can be a bit frustrating for me because I tend to want to build an empire and I am very risk averse. This can work in a two player game but with more people it becomes chaotic and more like guerrilla warfare. I am just not that good at this style of play - it doesn't fit my personality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I know I'm in the minority on this, but my favorite part of this game is its theme, and how thematic it is. I know it's blasphemy to say this about a Knizia, but I love the theme of a family being involved in the development of multiple nations, being pushed out, coming back in a rival nation. The stories you can tell with this are a cool, Game of Thrones-like intrigue. I love how each color does something different. Making such things feel different in small ways is something I like a bunch, and this does it well.

RATING: 4
After playing a few times this game plays where you beat up on the little guy in order to stage the final confrontation with the other big guy in the game. So you are either the big guy (because of a good starting draw) and you pick on the little guy... or you are a small guy and get really good draws and finally get to internal conflict the big guy... or you just get to be the little guy the whole game. Lets just draw the colors out of the bag to decide the winner instead to save some time shall we?

The scoring is based on who has the most blocks of smallest colored amount. Yet people still try to monopolize one or two colors the whole game thinking it is of benefit by simply denying someone else of it. So when the game is all over, the winner has 6-8 points or so... all that effort for 8 points...

This is a very interesting area control game. I'll play this anytime someone asks. The only reason I don't give this a ten is that the luck factor from the tile draw can be fairly significant. Statistics will help you predict likely draws, but that will only help you so much.

RATING: 7
Deep. Bewildering. Varied.

Still waiting for a game where everyone is on the ball and everything clicks together. Too much struggling against tile draw inertia; too vague a sense of how you're doing (because hey, hidden scoring); too much of a gamble to set up conflicts instead of scrabbling for safe points while the clock ticks down; too little pressure on the leader (because hey, hidden scoring). I like the game but it's not scaling the ratings as I had hoped.

Still wondering how open scoring would work.

2017-02-25 - 8.5 - Great intense game where you mess up with other players from the very beggining! I really enjoy the theme, which might be a little abstract, but is very consistent and makes sense as opposed to many point salad do-whatever-get-points games. The rules are really simple for what kind of game it is, but you can do a lot with them and really most of your success depends on your reaction to other players' actions, not exploiting the game mechanisms on your own.

In relation to the other Eurogames I've played since having been introduced to the genre, Tigris was quite unique.  I liked that it had some aspects of a resource development/management game but it was contained in the same system as an abstract game of conflict.  The competitive mechanics were much smoother in this game than other Euros I've played.  Games like Catan, Caylus, and Puerto Rico are built on a core system of personal resource management, so when you get robbered or provosted it can be frustrating, ie, "Why didn't they just concentrate on their own development?"  But in Tigris it felt very clear and natural.

RATING: 3
While an interesting game with a lot of strategic depth, I find the luck of the tile draw often can overcome strategies.  It's tough to need some red tiles to win internal conflicts and not have them, or find your opponent has a hand full of them.  There's a lot of interesting things going on in the game, but this feature knocks the game down a few points for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun strategic game of tile laying and building a kingdom.  Better than I expected.  I'd like to play again but finding someone that wants to play is the problem (believe it or not).  A seven maybe higher; I've given it an eight for now out of respect.  Could go up; could go down; could stay the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is the greatest example of a less is more design paradox.  Knizia has given players about 5 million torturously difficult decisions from a total of about 5 cohesively designed mechanics.  
You can play this game fast and loose or slow and tight.  And there are both tactical and strategic considerations with the random tile drawing and the hidden scoring mixed with almost a chess-like potential for misplay in tile placement.  
Because of the hidden information and the randomness, you cannot simply analyze the best play like you can in a more abstract game with perfect information.  This dynamic is created in true Knizia fashion with a set of mechanics that constrain players just enough so no one gets overwhelmed by analysis paralysis while considering their many possible actions.  
It's Knizia's ability to walk this line and make a game that feels both light and deep that makes gameplay feel satisfying without being exhausting.

One of my favorite heavier games, which I still haven't wrapped my head around yet...but still enjoy playing

I can see why this game has much acclaimation, it even scales well from 2-4, though the dynamic completely changes.

The internal/external combat is one of the neatest concepts I've seen in gaming, causing you to balance out your defences.  Kind of gives you the feeling of playing two positions at the same time.

Maybe I'll actually win one day...

A real brain-burner!  This is a game worthy of some exploration.  The first couple times you play, the strategy is hard to grasp.  

This is Reiner Knizia's most interesting game - at least as it appeals to my intellect.  But there is a extremely dry feel to this game.  (The theme enhances this.)  Mechanically this game is hard to grasp, and takes some repeated plays to learn how to play well.

Unfortunately these lessons get lost with long gaps between plays.  So lately my sporadic plays of this title have been less fun than earlier sessions I can recall.

Bought at Playing Games on Museum Street in London sometime around 2000, when on vacation with my then girlfriend. I remember reading about this on the young Internet, it being hyped as some guy "Knizia"'s to-be-masterpiece. It was probably the theme that interested me most as I had not yet discovered Eurogames, being firmly planted in Avalon Hill material.

The game is Knizia at his best, and is one of my favourites, though it is somewhat demanding of its players. Scales very well between 2-4 persons, I think. Somewhat of a brainburner, though. Try & you'll like!

A little bit euro, a little bit wargame (Well high conflict game anyway).  I grew up on wargames and chess so I don't get the "We all have to hold hands and play nice when playing a game." thing so many these days seem to have.  This game sort of even reminds me of other old games like Acquire in how "mergers" happened.  More than any other element though the scoring system is a brilliant design and showcases just how lazy many more modern game designs are with their boring scoretrack and 84 ways to score points.  Tigris & Euphrates is simply a perfect and elegant game design.  And its not complex at all, only the strategies are.  I sold my original copy in order to eventually pickup the FFG one as I dig the art in it.

I played 20 games in 3 days. I played 2, 3 and 4 players games and all of them required different strategies which I liked very much. As I learn more tactics and tricks, the game is more exciting and more fun. Winning is great but losing is also not bad like playing go. Overall, this is a brilliant abstract strategy game that I feel like I will always keep to play more. This is better than go especially when multiple conflicts and alliances simultaneously occur in a battle.

Severely outdated. The tiles drawn is a lot based on luck especially for the over powered red tiles. The victory condition is unique by having the bag with the lowest points  determining the highest score. Blind bidding with loser losing tiles that they bid as well. A yawn fest, had a hard time seeing how this was strategic. I was surprised this was rated so highly on Board game geek, but I think overtime the rating will continue to drop. Seek out better tile-placement games.

My favorite Reiner Knizia game. First several plays are very abstract but upon reflection and replay, strategy and planning become more obvious. As with many of his games, balance is important since it is the person that has the most of the least that determines the winner – tile distribution adds some randomness into the game but does not take away from the depth or options available. Board position can be important as well as carful observation of other players weak colors. Quite enjoyable game that does not get as much play time as it deserves.

The first impression when learning Tigris & Euphrates is a big "Huh?": the mechanisms that it employs are extremely clever and balanced, but they are far away from being intuitive so the first steps in learning curve can be frustrating and disappointing for some. The extreme shallowness of the theme does not help a bit there, so you are going to have a hard time if you do not like abstracts. But then, what is it good? Simple: everything else.

As a tile laying game, having a general strategy is important, but where you will squeeze your brain will be developing and adapting your tactics each turn, depending on what you draw. A lot of people complain of excessive luck and, though it is possible to be screwed, skill is far more determining than anything else, just make sure to keep changing your short term goals depending on what tiles you are dealt.

Another big plus of the game is the interaction, which is great: there are a lot of ways to affect your opponents, either creating conflicts or with a clever use of disaster tiles. Indeed, if you avoid conflict and you employ your disaster tiles poorly you will loose. The classic Knizia's scoring mechanism (ending score equal to your lowest partial score) works like charm and helps in growing the conflict atmosphere a lot.

What does Tigris & Euphrates offer? Well, it is a wonderful tile laying game with loans of interaction and possible lines of action. For me the game's luck factor is just enough to provide a challenging tactically game.

RATING: 10
Awesome game! Simply the best! Firmly occupies the top spot in my all-time top10. Rather complex and surprising when you start learning the game, but once you master the game mechanisms ... pure bliss! **** The goal of the game is to build-up a balanced civilisation (represented in the game by four colors). The importance of the "balance" is obvious from the very original victory points calculation: your final points are the number of cubes in the color of which you have fewest. **** Luck is limited to the tiles you draw. The game is tactical in the appropriate use of the set of tiles you have, but still also strategical in the placement of tiles to allow building monuments and to avoid loosing external power during conflicts between other leaders. The randomness of the tiles ensures replayability. Even if you are very low in a specific tile, it is possible to win. **** Euphrat & Tigris plays equally well with 4, 3 or 2 players, although is at its best with 4. One-on-one games between equally skilled players will most likely result in very tense games, often decided by a single tile or a rather minor tactical error. **** My most played game with more than 175 plays, mainly thanks to the online version at BGG. By the way, the open scoring makes it even more tactical. **** The Nile (2-player variant board) is a refreshing new map and can also be played online at BGG. Played: 9 (win: 8, 5 as lion and 3 as urn - loss:1, 1 as lion).

This classic stands up to many playings.  I have only played on BGG and find the physical components of the game (which I've seen played) a bit underwhelming in some of the editions.

I enjoyed this one on my first playing, on a purely intellectual level.  Uses the seemingly counter-intuitive "weakest-set-scores" mechanism that Knizia seems to prefer (of course, it's just completed sets).  Must play again to see if it's actually "fun" for repeated plays.

UPDATE: I've played this a few times now.  It's OK.  I almost never want to sit down to play it.  It's not "boring" so it's not a 5.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  May simply be too dry, abstract, and calculating for me.  The terminology is irritating -- the baroque system of "internal conflicts" always using red tiles, but "external conflicts" using the tiles of the leader is a little weird.  A better name would probably help new players grok the rules.

Bought it together with Puerto Rico in dreamland 
At the amazing price of   €20
I expect that this rating (7) will go up after more plays. Allthough I am not to certain that many friends of mine will give this a try.
The game doesn't look as good as other games I own.

Update after another pay lowered it back to a 7.

I just find it too hard to plan ahead. In a four layer game the board changes a lot.
I try to keep track of the lowest scores of other players So I know how much I need to win. (change 12 tiles in your turn is a game end speedener)

Understanding the rules of this game seems like a daunting task the first time you sit down with it but as me and my wife started playing we found it wasn't that hard to get at all.  The strategy that is required to do well is staggering but that's not a bad thing.  We ended up quitting because it was going on 3 hours and we only were through half the tiles (good thing too 'cause I was getting thrashed)but I anticipate it going a little smoother next time now that we know what we're doing a little better.  Deep, amazing game.

I do like the mechanisms involved in this game however there are a few down sides for me. To play this game well you have to be aggressive (not my style) and there is an element of luck in the tiles you draw. (I would certainly prefer a less luck based method of obtaining tiles). Other than that though, the scoring mechanism and the monuments are big plusses. There is a lot in this game, but its certainly not a fluffy game.

I really, really enjoy this game, as we've played with a great range of strategies even in our first run of games.  With limited actions, there are too many things to do, and risks have to be taken.  There are ways to counter bad luck, and there are certainly brilliant moves undertaken from game to game.  I'm hoping that my enjoyment of this game can last a lifetime.  It's too bad that it only supports four, but that limit helps keep the game tight and the action moving.  Players should be somewhat balanced in skill, and kingmakers can really ruin the game.

Euphrat & Tigris is a good game. Not great but very good and I always gladly join to the game. E&T is definitely a 'gamers game'. 
In this game it's important, that everybody knows how to play the game; otherwise the winner is the player who sits next to beginner. But if all players are veterans, then E&T is almost a fantastic experience.

RATING: N/A
Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris & Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.

Maybe it's because I started playing this one only after the other two titles in the tile-laying trilogy; I'm not sure this one is the best of the bunch. Strong and great game, but luck has a bigger role than in TtD and Samurai; also it is strictly for gamers (while the other two aren't). At the moment it does not seem to be the game that is the hardest to win against gamers with lot of experience.
Update: while all said above is true, it IS a very enjoyable game, a great one in fact. It's just very different from the other two in the trilogy. One of the best games I have, and the second best of the trilogy.

RATING: 6
[Original] The heaviest Reiner Knizia game ever published (to date). That said, it is by no means unapproachable. As in Knizia's "Through the Desert", once you get past the concept that as a player you are not a "color", the game is easy-to-learn but hard-to-master. What is interesting, is that this conflict game offers a nearly unique end-game scoring system (seen again in Knizia's 2004 release Ingenious). This tile-laying game should be played (at least once) by every gamer, be that gamer a Euro gamer or grognard. 

[2007.Mar.19] Traded my 1998 (Deutsch) Hans im Glück edition of T&E away. Although, this game is well-respected and loved-by-many, it simply did not receive enough time on the game table to warrant its inclusion in my game collection. To be honest, I always feel like I "play at" playing the game, rather than play the game. I guess T&E simply doesn't hit the right chords for me.

[2007.Aug.8] To clarify, T&E is by no means a bad game. I am sure that I will continue playing this Knizia classic in the future; it's simply not my first choice to play.

Phenomenal game with an utterly unique array of brilliant and jaw-dropping dynamics. I can see why so many people consider this to be Knizia's masterpiece!

I normally wouldn't change the rules of a game so well designed; however, I think this slight balance tweak can be justified: the first 2 players only take 1 action for their initial turns. (In a 2-player game, this restriction only applies to the first player.) This subtle modification compensates very well for the known turn-order advantage, without changing the fundamental strategies/tactics/etc. of the game. It's also very Knizia-esque: he used this same balancing principle in Through the Desert one year after Tigris and Euphrates was published.

The archetypal euro.  An exceptional game that is now suffering from old age for me.  I rarely say this, but here, the theme and ambiance is so abstract and inconsequential that we tend to favor newer, "shinier" games.  Still, it's a classic for the thinking player.  With the years, it seems playing Tigris feels more and more like playing 'Go' or 'Chess', and less and less like playing a boardgame (in the modern sense).

RATING: 2
I knew that this game was not for me, but I happen having no choice to play it. Anyways, since it's a classic, I had at least to play it at least once.

It's a very abstract game, the theme is very thin, there is a lot of colors, which is bad for me since I am partially color blind, and it's made by knizia. These are all good reasons for me to hate the game.

Because of the color issues, it's very hard for me to analyze the board. I do not have problem differentiating colors, it's just that it's hard for me to see in a glance which chunk will have a majority in a certain color.

Second, each leader has special powers, each tile have a different effect in certain circumstance which makes it sometimes confusing making the board even harder to analyze.

So this game is only made for pure euro style games fanatics. The theme is so thin that you have no feeling of actually building up a civilization.

This classic has to be one of my favorite Knizia games.  It's stellar with four and very good with three.  It takes newbies a bit getting used to in understanding the effects of certain actions or inactions and in learning the distinction between internal vs. external conflicts.  It's also important to understand the probabilities of drawing a red tile vs. a blue tile vs. a black or green tile throughout the game.  Keeping track of these is probably as important as trying to keep track of which players have accumulated how many of which colored cubes.

What it comes down to is that for such a calculative, brain-burning game, far, FAR too much of it comes down to the luck of the tile draw.  You can get completely killed, or dominate an opponent completely, based on a hot or cold run of the tiles.

I just don't like the mixture of brain-burner / wild chaos.  One or the other would be fine, but I don't want to stare at the board for minutes pondering my fate and have it all be undone because I didn't draw enough red.

Too, the rules are just a tad too fiddly for me as to annoy.

In the end, I traded it away.  I might play it again if someone put a copy in front of me, but I don't feel the need to own this.

RATING: 7
Wanted to play because the high BGG rating.  Some claim this as a deep Euro type game.  Interesting to know how does it play out. I like the iOS version much better than the boardgame version given that it is basically a mathematically maximization game. Euroish and abstract. There are a lot of choices and somewhat like GO.  Each game can be very variable and testing your nerve all the time.        

I quite like the game and so far I haven't been able to beat the AIs yet.  The game seems to have a lot of layers and deeper than I initially thought.  There are quite some options to make the game interesting and longevity extended, for examples, hidden scores, hidden tiles and hidden no. of remaining tiles heightens the darkness revolving around you about the development of the other civilizations and timing of the end of the game.

A lot of strategy and a lot of abstractness in this civilization/war game.

RATING: 10
Definitely my favorite game alongside Imperial (and now Chicago Express). Very simple rules, but it really takes a while to master the strategies.

One of those games that will make you talk about for quite some time after each play. Some say it is "too abstract", but, to me, the design of this game is just perfect. Newbies tend to think luck of the draw is excessive here, but my experience in the old days in Tigris@BGG clearly shows that good players will virtually always beat bad players regardless of what they draw. This is really *the* benchmark in strategic/tactical board game elegance.

My rating is for the 2-player game.

Great feelings: the conflict is open on many fronts.  Great tension.  Both strategy and tactics are very present.  Drawing tiles adds randomness but luck is not so important.

Intense reflexion.  The fact that kingdoms are not necessarily owned by a single player is refreshing.

Quite difficult to play, in the first few games.  It takes time to get accustomed to _not_ owning a kingdom.  Also, the two types of conflicts are easily confused, at the beginning.

Not good for 2 at 30%, according to BGG!  (Good or best at 70%...)

This IS a great game, but it works best with those who want to play it as a flexible, intense building game.  The last time I saw it played, the boys playing treated it much like a war game, which was fun enough for them.  It was very slow and cheesy for a wargame, and they missed all the fun subtlety of adding your leaders to an area started by someone else.

One of the few games my wife and I are strongly divided on. I enjoy this game immensely but have only had 3 opportunities to play so far; she claims it is too strategic for her tastes (though she does about as well as I do in terms of score). Her last session she said was her most enjoyable yet, so perhaps it's just a matter of slowly getting a handle on the rules (here's hoping)... seems everyone has had a hard time wrapping their head around the differences between internal and external conflict when first starting out.

Finally a chance to play this one.  Found it very tough to "see" the whole board and figure out how to play.  Managed to do well, mainly through others blowing each other away and being in possesion of the right tiles when I was attacked.Rating based on one play - not sure whether I would get this myself as not sure how much play it would get.  Keen to play again as I'm sure it would take three or four plays to have a good idea of even the basic moves.

I hesitated to rate this because I've only played here on BGG, and the normal flow of the game isn't readily apparent that way.  Now, however, I am convinced that this is a great game.  The randomness of the tile draw, which can lead to frustration sometimes, is the one thing standing between this game and a 10 rating from me.  Still, it is very deep, both strategically and tactically, with a large strategy space for a German game.  Too bad I pretty much suck at it.  I may even add it as an entry in Fawkes ludomasochism GeekList :)

UPDATE: I decided 9 was a tad high for the time being, although I imagine that when I get to play this FtF (assuming I do eventually), this will get bounced back up.  Call it a wannabe 9 :)

UPDATE: Ah what the heck.  I'm always playing this on BGG, usually 3 or more games at a time.  If that isn't a 9 I don't know what is.

UPDATE: I now own a copy, and have played it face-to-face. What a pleasure, although it will probably take a couple more plays before the others in my group get comfortable with the game. Still a 9, but there's some upside potential there.

A tile placing game with interesting tactical decisions. The theme is weak, but the gameplay is fun and the action fast. I do feel, however, that with 4 players the game is veering on random with no chance for long-term planning and, as such, is not up there with the strategic greats like El Grande or Amun-Re. Perhaps you should be able to choose your tile colours...

RATING: 7
I had no idea what I was doing in the game I've played, but I can still tell how expertly designed this game is. It's like the modern Go, fairly straightforward rules but incredibly brain burny with a place a piece for area control aspect. The different colors makes you have to consider different modes of play by your opponents, while the scoring of your minimum color score makes it so you can't just spam one color. Like Go where you place your tiles is not immediately apparent all the ramifications it has, which adds layers of strategy, but also potentially AP. The random tile draw while some might not like the randomness adds some hand management aspects to the game while presumably making the start of the game more variable, and there is a mulligan action (which is not a complete wasted turn, you can also use it to stock up on a color you want or rush the end of the game). Overall seamlessly combines all of its mechanisms together (albeit very abstractly) into a game that I can understand why there are many proponents that it should be ranked #1.

I wish the board's size scaled to the number of players, as otherwise it seems too open with less than 4, but it is nice that there are 2 sides to play on.

RATING: 9
A classic.  When you read the rules at first, it seems less streamlined than many of Knizia's games, but the depth those extras add to the game is vital.  Each turn is short and tight and each decision builds on the others.  Many turns will be simple and straightforward, building and building.  And then the conflict (which is the heart of this game) begins and a turn of intense concentration ensues, where you weigh every option carefully.  It is true that a lack of one color (especially red, but often blue) can thwart even a great player, but for the most part, a great player will not let his inadequacies show.  There is some luck, then, in the draw of the tiles.  Again, a good player will be ready and will make sure of his victories and reduce the losses.  As I said, a classic.  I should be playing it more.

This is a classic tile-laying boardgame with simple rules.  Collect the most sets of all four color cubes, and you win.  Includes elements of direct conflict, push-your-luck, and hidden/trackable information.  Reiner Knizia's masterpiece.  The Sage mobile app is also pretty decent.

This is a physically beautiful game, with a lovely board and varied components that achieve a gorgeous stylistic unity. Gameplay is lots of fun - full of tension and reversals, and the "count your lowest score" mechanic is pure genius. This having been said, although the rules are very idiosyncratic it does play rather abstract. For this reason, it just barely loses out (for me at least) to the more recent, highly similar KHRONOS, which is perhaps not as original, but has even better art, and rules that do a palpably better job of catching the theme.

With every time i play this game, i start to like it more and more. I like it how you have to adapt to the tiles you are drawing, how well the games scales with the number of players (even fun with 2 players!), how many possibilities of developing the board exist and so on...

I even think that the theme of rising and falling empires in the area between the rivers tigris and euphrates is very well catured. The pieces of the game are also very well done so this might become a strong contender for my first 10...

My favorite Reiner Knizia game.  You place tiles on a map to score points of different colors if you have a leader of the same color in that kingdom.  Form a square to build a temple that scores every turn.  You can have rebellions and wars to remove tiles from the game and score points.  

Your score is your lowest number of points on a color track which encourages you to have balance when expanding your tracks.  

I really like this game.  It was formally a BGG number 1 ranked game and it is different than most other games.  If you have not played I strongly recommend you play.

RATING: N/A
Worth owning for a good price, but recognize that this game is definitely heavy at 3.6 weight and therefore will not be played too often by casual gamers. 

Tigris & Euphrates has been through several different editions already:
1997 - Original German edition: Hans im Glück = Top Licence & 999 Games (French/Dutch)
2003 - Original English edition: Mayfair Games (Beige box, thin blue border)
2007 - Revised German edition: Pegasus Spiel
2008 - Revised English edition: Mayfair Games (Blue box) --> THIS VERSION (the revision) IS THE ONE TO GET!!
NB: "Main diff betwn the 2 english editions is the map artwork and some additional elements" (ex: new artwork, doubled sided expansion map)
NB: Box says 3-4 players. WRONG! it's 2-4 like it's predecessor.
NB: Not enough treasure cubes for the expansion board (comes with 10, but needs 14)

Why did Mayfair produce a revised edition?
Mayfair sold out of its previous copies of Tigris & Euphrates. Since the German publisher Pegasus Spiele released a revised version of Tigris & Euphrates with several new elements (a two-sided gameboard, four new civilization buildings, and an advanced scenario for game play), Mayfair decided to incorporate these new elements in its new printing. The new elements were designed by Knizia himself.

Correctly described as "Dry as bone" by many, but still a very enjoyable (abstract) strategy game.  Use the "Tile Pool"-variant to limit the random element; and/or add the "Artist Expansion" (with some tweaks) to make the game even better.  

Update: game made slightly less dry with some rule clarifications.

Not my type of game.
Too abstract and too much direct conflict by today's standard. Back in the old days this one is probably the best Ameri-Euro, right now we have lots of offers from companies like FFG making this game loses much of its appeal.

Tigris & Euphrates is highly interactive, with fast and epic changes on the board, and a reasonable fog-of-war.
Each turn is a puzzle to be solved, but it's not too deep, due to the random draw, which limits the downtime.
It's surprisingly difficult to learn, since what looks to be symetrical, turns out not to be - there are exceptions to most rules, but it all balances out.

Some players think it all comes dawn to drawing the right tiles, but that's only true if you look at a single turn - over the course of the game it equals out. If you play your tiles, instead of looking for tiles to play, then you win.
Think like this: Instead of looking at the board for the best move, and then at your tiles for the ability to make that move, then look at your tiles and make the best play you can.
Don't (and I'm close to saying never) waste a move on exchanging tiles - it'll only frustrate you, and it's not the way to win (unless of course, you do it to empty the bag in the face of you worst opponent ;-)

RATING: 7.5
First impression after two 3p games.  I can see why this is a Knizia and abstract classic.  Very interesting abstract game with a high degree of player interaction and what appear to be an open board with many ways to advance one's strategy.  In spite of the "luck of the draw" it is definitely a skill based abstract where a more skilled player will have an advantage.  Very intrigued, would like to play it again to get a better sense of how fluid it is and how interesting after repeated plays.  Don't beleive those who say that there is a theme -- it is a pure Knizia game, abstract with a great game mechanic and a pasted on theme for cosmetic purposes.

Tigris and Euphrates walks the line between the mutually exclusive qualities that attract me to games.  It is great with 2, but scales well to three or four.  It has confrontation but no player elimination.  It offers multiple paths to victory, and all paths have an equal chance of bearing a player to victory.  It is a study in compromise, the most versatile game in my collection.

A classic game I respect a lot, good enough for a few plays every year but not more. Games seem to follow similar patterns every time.
Update 2016: some renewed interest in it, and I must say the "similar patterns" I mentioned earlier seems like a dumb comment now. Most games have that to some extent, and it's certainly not worse in T&E. Deservedly a classic, one of Knizia's best.

Hailed as one of the Greats.  It's just O.K. and hasn't grabbed me like others who swear by it.  Need more plays to get a better feel for it.

UPDATE: Starting to feel like you should just stockpile red tiles and wait for a less experienced player to make a tactical mistake and then POUNCE!...stealing the treasure they've worked for or the monument they've built.  Suffers from the PR seating order/experience level syndrom with a very similar result.

This game really can't be called themeless.  This feels like a game that was played in ancient Sumeria as their version of a game of Fertile Crescent Empires rising and falling.  You'll get it the first time you see a vast empire wiped out in one catastrophic conflict, watching as the remnants either fade under the shifting sands or rise again to challenge for supremacy in the region.

My only critique?  The anticlimactic (yet undoubtedly good strategy) way the game can end with someone choosing to empty the bag on their turn.

The Knizia Magnum Opus. The ultimate masterpiece. Very simple mechanically, yet offers astounding depth and strategical possibilities. The mechanisms are abstracted to purity but the thematic connection is still discernible in how each kind of conflict is resolved and how the different civilizations that the players represent and guide relate to each other. There aren't many games that I think everyone should own, but this is one of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I feel this one is best with 2. It can get a little random with 4 but is still enjoyable. 

Some call it a bit dry and I can see where this argurment can be made.
The rules are simple enough but understanding the result of a tile lay due to conflicts is not so obvious. It taks a few plays to get a grip on how the system works. 

The game plays well and rewards planning ahead.

Complex, but enough look ahead is possible.  The staredowns prior to a battle are reminiscent of poker.  Lots of decisions and a constant worry of how to spend your limited actions during a turn.  You always need a third action.  Brilliant.  It is, however, a game that I completely forget how to play when I haven't been playing it recently.

(2/17) 8. A classic and much deserving of the title. Just a fantastic, fantastic game that is full of interesting choices.  Extremely deep, but not necessarily that heavy or overly complex.  Both my plays included players new to the game and they were able to figure things out after a turn or two.  My onlllly complaint, and it's quite minor, is that it's a touch long but that's mostly due to players being very careful and thoughtful about their moves (at least in our games) and not because of the game.

(10/17) Raise to 9.  Such a brawny, thoughtful classic.  My #16 favorite game of all time.

It's very involving game, kind of "Si vis pacem, para bellum". But if player wish he can push his luck in early conflict. Advanced game makes it more dynamic, recommended for experienced players. Surprisingly short playing time for such a deep game 90-120 minutes.

Hard for me to rate faily, according to BGG standards.

It's a very cool game, intricate, interlocking, clever, deep, Knizia-reffic and all that. 

But it's also brutal (in a good way) and has oodles of direct conflict. According to how often I actually want to play it, I should give it a 6 or so, but because it's such a perfectly designed game, I have to bump it up nearer to the BGG norm. 

It's definitely what I call a 'grumpy' game.

+ plastic cubes!

Rating based on 3 and 4 players.

A wonderful game. A terrific blend between strategy, thinking, and just the right amount of luck in the tile draw. The rare Euro that has elegant rules that encourages aggressive play. A game that requires careful consideration, but doesn't have too much downtime because you might have to act on anyone's turn. The hidden scoring and tile-drawing makes things less AP-prone, and gives the game tension--you can deduce, you can guess, but you can never truly KNOW.

Despite Knizia's reputation for pasted-on themes, I find the mechanics of T&E to be closely tied to the game's theme of kingdoms being built and falling--it doesn't matter to you, you only care about your dynasty and doing what benefits it. Revolt/war mechanics make sense--are the people/the gods on your side, or your opponent's?

I have the FFG version, and am happy with it--the only problem I have is that that I miss the cubes from the previous versions (EDIT: I bling'd it out with cubes!)

RATING: 10
Hands down one of my favorite games of all time, which by now surely can be called a classic. Coincidentally, the very first game I played when getting back into games in 2002 after a long hiatus.

Brilliant design by Knizia; atypical in the sense that a game like this wouldn't (and didn't) pop out of his creative process regularly. A towering achievement by a master at the height of his powers, Knizia manages to synthesize his design approach into a single masterpiece that tells a story and has a narrative arc without any crutches (phases, etc.) or chrome. 

Game/theme link is downright fantastic, though abstract. The way kingdoms rise and prosper and then fall by the wayside through wars, with some remnants still languishing on the board, I find very evocative. Building a monument weakens the power base of the leader benefitting from it the most. Stunning how a relatively clutter-free design can include details like this by just flipping four tiles. 

Try to watch some of the old Board Room episodes on YouTube about E&T. They did a twelve-part series just on this game together with Knizia.

You people and your strategy! This game is not neccesarily one of my favourites. I did very poorly the first time I played, and have yet to figure out the strategy, especially playing with people who are smarter than I am (which is every time. It's saving grace is that when I played it for the first time I had a cute woman as my partner.

Rated after only one play. May be too dry for me. It definitely has lots of interesting things going on and requires thought.

A tile laying game. The game mechanic is simple, with you taking 2 of any 4 actions a turn (place tile, place/move leader, destroy tile, draw new tiles). However the game is a rich puzzle of building kingdoms and destroying your enemy. The game state changes so much from turn to turn that you are so invested in the game state. Many games say that you "care" or are "interested" in others turns, but this is the first game I've ever played that on others turn i did not worry so much about my next move, but was analyzing my opponents.

RATING: 9
This is just one of those games that, when youve figured out whats going on, youre blown away by how clever it is. 

Sometimes you can get screwed a bit on the tile draw but theres a lot more you can do to deal with this than some people make out. The games is about making the best possible moves with what youre given. And theres a huge amount of options.

Dont be put off by people claiming this game is too complicated to understand. Its really quite simple, even for a euro.

Clearly there's a lot going on here - if anything a bit too much for my liking. Reminds me somewhat unpleasantly of Go in the sense that one feels like you have to digest a vast scope of information and variation each turn. Nevertheless, there's some good positional and conflicting play going on as well as the scope to play both tactically and strategically. I can see this one going both up or down on repeated plays.

I find the tension in the game excellent.  The rules favor agressive play which makes it even more interesting.  I prefer the artwork of the original Mayfair edition over the reprint.

One of the few games that plays well across the entire spectrum of recommended players.

The rules are little hard to grasp for new to moderate gamers. New players seem to have trouble remembering that they're not playing a color but instead a figure/dynasty-image.  I've never had a problem determine internal from external conflict but that seems to be a tricky point with new players. Maybe it's the difference with how the payouts occur.

Many, many paths to victory. Rarely is there not something advantageous to do on your turn.

A great game design.  This is a disguised wargame, which is why most Eurogame players hate it.  It's nasty and cut-throat.  Must be played with mature players.

My second favorite Knizia game behind Ra, and my #1 favorite tile placing game to date. This game hasn't been beat yet, although I heard Attika is a hell of a tile placement game. When the civilizations collide in this game, I picture vast battles with tons of armies fighting over each square. Definitely Knizia's second best idea to cook up in his beautiful brain to date.

Repeat playings keep stripping away from this, it's a "decent" tile laying game, but there are many better games I'd rather play out there.

Jó játék, de itthonra túl konfrontatív, úgyhogy megmarad az alkalmi játékklubokra. A lapkajárás (egy adott szín hiánya) kulcshelyzetekben idegesítő tud lenni, szóval a konfrontáció+szerencsefaktor miatt nekem nem nyújt akkora élményt, mint amit a BGG-s helyezése alapján vártam.

Update kb. 30 (gép elleni) játék után: zseniális játék, de sajnos tényleg kell hozzá jónéhány játék, hogy az ember ráérezzen az ízére, sokan pedig nem tudnak belefektetni ennyi időt/energiát, ezért is jó a digitális verzió :)

A solid game overall. The internal and external battles are interesting mechanics not present in many other games this way which along with the lowest section score makes it less of a majority control game and more about timing and focus. 

The types of battles and kingdom join rules take a bit to explain though, but after a quick first game, people jump in. Hidden points are always good (avoids bash the leader). 

No real theme though, so if that bothers you, this may not be a hit.

Preliminary rating: I really like this game. It has an abstract feel, but the theme is very well chosen. It looks like the gameplay is really in line with the theme (building up and breaking up of kingdoms with wars that give you spoils and might let you lose income).

I think this game is easy to understand and gameplay is simple, but it takes a while if you're AP prone: there are so much options! Only building and with that mechanic collecting points will not be enough to win the game. The conflicts and monuments and treasures are necessary to get a competitive score.

Definitive rated: the game feels very thematic and abstract alike. This is what I want a game to be.

Edit: gave this version away to my parents. They liked their one play of it and we plan a few more in the future... ;)

RATING: 10
Yes, I know: I bought a second copy... The new edition, same game. I love the plastic bits (they look really cool), but somehow I like the wooden bits a bit more. Especially the fact that the wooden monuments were evenly divided in colour (the colour missing for the main building was black, only stairs are black), now 3 out of 6 plastic monuments, the main building is black. That's a bit too much black that can alter a bit of the playstyle (black is visually made more important). 

What if FFG would have made the same bits, but then in wood? And what if FFG had kept the same colours of monuments used in all the older versions? And what if FFG would have made the tiles with a qualitative better cardstock? Then I think I would sell my Mayfair copy.

A fantastic game on a number of levels.  High degree of conflict in a tile placement format.  There is randomness but there ample ways to mitigate it through careful play.

It maintains a high level of dynamics and change in the gameplay, and keeps each game fresh and challenging.

03/11/03 Played once, 4-player, using the first Mayfair edition, and I'm very leary of ever trying it again. Mentally very taxing. It seemed 90% of the time everyone except the game owner had no idea what they were doing. A good deal of this I chalk up to the game owner's poor rules explanation. Of course he won easily. I might try it again, but only with someone who can explain the rules well. For now I rate it a "2".  
 
05/10/08 Played again, 3-player, with a good rules explanation, using the Top License Games edition. It was... OK. Changed my rating to a "5". I'll probably play it again, though I'll never ask for it. I think I have the mechanics down now. But I'm still pretty clueless on strategy and tactics. 06/21/08 Played another three-player game. I did a little better, but I still have no grasp of strategy. 08/26/08 Another three player game. I'm beginning to get an inkling of strategy. I stumbled my way to victory. 05/16/09 Played another three-player game. Its clear to me I'm never going to fully grok this game. Me playing T&E is pretty much an exercise in futility.

There is the perfect amount of luck. My only problem is that there is only one spot on the board where a farm monument can be built. (I realize other monuments can be built that can blue that are not on that space.)

RATING: 9
This game hits the sweet spot for me - enough luck to keep the AP away, but still it's so tactical that the best player most often wins. Knizia is a genius! The only minuses comes from the lack of theme - I don't feel like I'm building an empire, but rather I'm just laying tiles. plus the game is a bit longish.

RATING: 6
Some of the best mechanics the abstract master has ever come up with. Why he decided to tack this theme on afterwards though, I don't know as for all my love of history, I just can't see it, either in reality or stylized.

However I don't play it enough to really get into the tactics successfully.

RATING: 8
Excellent tile-laying strategy game with area-control undertones and tactical piece movement. Extraordinarily well though-through rules that though somewhat on the compact side rather than purely elegant defines an incredibly rich mechanics that affords multiple styles of play and growing with the game. At its base an abstract game, but where the theme of developing cities and states in Mesopotamia feels right and not shoehorned on the mechanics. It is a little masterpiece, with chess-like brain burning and long session times for deep thinkers being the principal drawbacks. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rating based on a couple of plays.  Impressive.  It contains many things I really like in a game - tile laying, area influence, sneakiness, and horribly difficult decisions when you can only pick two things to do but need to do many more.  The only thing that would stop me from playing it at a given moment is if my brain is just not feeling up to it - it can be exhausting.

Le berceau de l'humanité
La Mésopotamie, et plus précisément la région bordée par les deux fleuves nourriciers que sont le Tigre et L'Euphrate à été le théâtre du développement des premières civilisations. C'est ce thème que nous propose de revisiter Reiner Knizia, le plus célèbre et prolifique des auteurs allemands, avec son jeu "Euphrat und Tigris" (E&T). L'objectif de chaque joueur est d'accumuler 4 sortes de Points de Victoires (PV) en installant ses propres chefs à la tête des différents royaumes qui vont se constituer et évoluer.

New in collection Dec.06. Unfortunately with slight misprint. Solved nicely by Mayfair.
March 07: Initial impression after two 2-person plays: Whoa, nice one indeed! Loads of possible tactics, catching up etc. Can't hardly wait to play this with more people.

Update: downgraded a point. For some reason I'd rather suggest and play other games. Still like it though.

Update: downgraded 2 more points. After buying 200 better games I think this game is bonedry and therefore boring. I'd rather play a good abstract than this "painted" abstract. Yeah, there's some turnangst, there's various tactics. There's just no fun. Put it up for trade.

Update: sold it.

NL: pittig spel met relatief eenvoudige regels. vind 'm goed qua regels, maar kwam niet zo vaak op tafel. Zou het komen omdat het bord niet zo mooi is? Of omdat het spel zo gortdroog voelt?

I think this is one of the best boardgames out there. While it's ranked a notch below Puerto Rico on the Geek, I consider it more likely to be played in the XXII-c. as, if nothing else, a representative of the "Euro" craze of the early XXI. It's also uncommon among Euros as actually involving its theme in gameplay; it doesn't feel "pasted on" at all. My girlfriend (who was not a Eurogamer before me) also loves this game. I think, in spite of its depth/complexity, it's quite accessible to the strategically adept non- (or not-yet) gamer.

RATING: 8
Civilisations blossom and collapse, violently. The game is one of slowly building up your position, carefully sculpting your moment to pounce. Its also about surfing the chaos of your opponents who aim to do the same. 

A volatile game, prone to erupting into chaos as plans go awry. Almost like a card game it has that edge of bluffing and posturing, your position is never quite safe, but they don’t know where you are weak, and vice versa for them. Yet despite the volatility there is a strong core that keeps the game from descending into the roll of a dice. The scoring (you score 1 for every complete set, aka your score is the colour you are weakest in) means that the game remains tense even after your little civilisation was thrown into disarray, your leaders exiled, your plans wrecked. You can come back by making the necessary sacrifices, feeding points to players who no longer need that colour, then throw down in a wild gambit to pull yourself back in contention. Another strength of the game are the many nuances of the positional play - for the first few games it is easily lost on a player that while where you place and what can at times seem insignificant, it is anything but. Bad placements will haunt you, weaken you and take away the edge you need to win.

So you have the recipe for a very tense game and this tension builds in waves, because it is unavoidable that conflicts will erupt at some point. Not only because the board shrinks but because wars and monuments are the only way you can go beyond what is otherwise a maximum scoring potential of 2 points per turn (aka potentially half a point at best). As for theme, well, history unfolds itself on the board, delivering a far more thematic game than even the most chrome-laden comparison. 

In short I really enjoy this game, its not an obvious game and can take a bit getting into and understanding the “hows” and “whys”, but this is a game you can play and do clever things in - or see other players do clever things, and what emerges will be different every game.

With the "right" people, this is an awesome game.  Brilliant, stunning and wonderful.  With the "wrong" people, you will only get glazed stares and soon-empty  chairs.  The view from the top is magnificent, but the climb up is a tough one.  "Weaker" rating due simply to entry barrier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The rules are easy to learn (although not necessarily easy to teach), imo, and the depth is perfect. I think the ebb and flow of the game fits perfectly with the theme. I can't wait to really play this game. Have only played a few times due to lack of players.
Update 8/7/2007: It's a pretty solid game. The game has lost some of its luster now that I've played a few online games. It's a really good game, but I prefer to play it in its board form.

Update 5 October 2008: Keeping it at an 8.5 as I really enjoy the game, but for some reason I have trouble keeping the rules straight (contrary to my original entry in which I played more regularly). I've played another 4-player game and it seems pretty chaotic. The winner is usually surprised and can't really explain her path to victory.

RATING: 10
Game in a Nutshell: Abstract tile-laying game of leaders and their kingdoms. All your leaders need support from tiles of the same color because you never know when an opponents leader might come looking for trouble and tear your status in the game apart as you know it.

Played as: 2 (Nile map on BGG),3,4 player

Pros: My current favorite, and it's definitely not because I always win; I rarely do. Luck is the mother of all variety but rarely decides the winner. Many important choices and never enough moves makes every turn feel like the game is in the balance. Requires a fair amount of creativity to stay in the game when you're not dealt the hand you'd hoped for; best of all this game gives you the freedom to do just that.

Cons: The rules never seem to be easily grasped due to the fact it's just a masked abstract. Part of the game's biggest problem is tied to its greatest strength: The openness of how you can affect the board with your turn. This creates the opportunity for some un-appreciated player-imposed chaos whether from a newer player or even a more experienced one who figures he's mathematically eliminated from the game and just wants to stir s*** up. Not a game I'd play two player as I find that the person who comes out on top in the first mash-up tends be at a huge advantage from that point on. 

Other: Takes one game to grasp the rules, at least three to realize potential strategy, and I don't know how long to "master" it (I'm nowhere close). That said, it's funny how experience was never essential for my enjoyment. My experience has shown that it's not a game for non-confrontational gamers. 

Best Use: When it's game night and the non-confrontational players are too tired or busy.

Recently totally revisited this game with fresh eyes after years of it sitting unplayed. It is a brilliant, well designed, tense game with a set of in your face simple, straightforward mechanics that require you to think through every turn. Every game plays differently. This isn't a friendly tile laying game - there will be conflict. The key is setting up your monuments and defenses against both internal and external attack. I won't say it is as elegant a blend of game and theme as something like Sekigahara, but it is a brilliant, thematic game for strategists and newer players alike - just don't let them play together.

Elegant. More options than action, very rarely can someone runaway with the game because the low color is the scoring color.

Players place tiles in order to control and take over four different commodities.  The winner is the player who scores the most in their lowest commodity total.  This is a fairly deep game which allows some opportunistic plays but also rewards good strategy.  UPDATE: raised rating up 1/2 a point.  This is still a very original game with a ton of tactical depth.

Yeay tile-laying options!  T&E is better suited to Euro play than the other major tile-laying games, since the intensity of placement (and potential to screw up your opponents' plans) is ever present.  Can stand to do some more plays before understanding the flow of the game perfectly well.

Gorgeous graphics, elegant design, just the right amount of randommness and maybe a bit too much luck... So many possibilities, yet the game flows reasonably fast. Great with any number of players, because of the tension it builds. What prevents this gem from getting a 10 from me is - to date -   the difficulty in finding opponents. Even the theme I think that fits well.

RATING: 9
Wow, is this a great game.  Currently I have this ranked #2 in my top 10.  I tend to like games with little to no luck, and this game provides exactly that.

In Tigris & Euphrate(T&E) everybody is trying to make the support for their leaders grow in the kingdoms on the board.  Each player starts with one leader in each color (4 total), and six random supporter tiles (4 different colors to match the leaders).  Players are given two actions per turn in which they can move around their leaders, add, tiles, or put down a destroying catastrophe tile.  As you play tiles in a kingdom (a group of tiles with at least one leader), cubes are given to the leader in that kingdom of the same color.

Everything goes great and everybody is happy until two leaders of the same color come together in the same kingdom.  This can happen in one of two ways.  The first is an internal conflict.  This happens when one player adds their leader to a kingdom that already has a leader of that color.  In this case the conflict is decided based on the temples (red tiles) that the leader is touching, plus any temples the player has in their 6 random tiles hidden behind their screen.  The loser (ties go to the defender) must remove their leader and the winner gets a red cube for their efforts.  The second is an external conflict.  This occurs when a tile joins up two kingdoms and their are leaders of a given color in both the two joining kingdoms.  In this case the conflict is settled based on the number of supporters (tiles of the same color) that are in your kingdom, plus tiles of that color you choose to use from behind your screen.  The loser removes their leader and every supporter from their kingdom.  The winner gets a cube for every piece removed.  This can really shake things up.

I love this game because there is so much strategy involved.  Sure when you draw to bring your tiles back up to 6 it is all random, but there are ways to improve your luck, and that isn't the main part of the game.  Like all strategy heavy games, this game suffers from new players making bad moves that help some other player out, so it is best to play this with people at the same skill level.  I only teach this to a group of people if I expect to get several plays out of it with that group.

I give this game a 9 because it is about as close to perfection in a game as I have ever seen.  It doesn't play too long, assuming there isn't a lot of AP going on, and the decisions each turn offer a lot of depth.  If you like games with a lot of luck, this one definitely isn't for you.

Fantastic game!

A classic tile laying game (and one of the earliest eurogames that I recall playing) that rewards both strategic planning and sharp tactical plays.

Probably the deepest and most challenging game in Knizia's Tile Laying Trilogy and the best imo.

Plays can be quite devastating and nasty, thereby rewarding smart and aggressive moves.

-------------------------------

Disappointed by the FFG 2015 edition for the following reasons:

- plastic monuments and player leaders don't handle as nicely or look as good as the wooden pieces used in the Mayfair or HiG edition.

- cardboard tokens used by FFG instead of the wooden cubes in prior editions are less visible (treasures on game board) and more difficult to handle. 

Map board art and tile artwork is OK, but it is subjective and a matter of taste as to which is better.  Glad I held onto my Mayfair 2008 edition.

I entered the hobby a bit after this game's heyday, when more modern boardgames were entering the market.  Honestly, I don't think my taste in games was mature enough yet to appreciate this design (though I typically dislike the good Doctor's games) but I do remember it being rather a dull and dreary affair.  One of the few games on this list that I'd like to give another shot.

RATING: 8.75
Played twice, with four players each time.  This is an area control game that has many unique mechanics, all of which add up to an amazingly complex, extremely tactical game that is loads of fun to play.  Players are highly restricted in the number of moves they can make (two per turn), and have only six tiles (which are used both to place on the board and to fight battles) in front of them, making each turn an exercise in precision.  Players have four different leaders they can place on the board in "empires" (sets of contiguous tiles with a leader in them); when "empires" are combined, or when two of the same type of leaders are put into an "empire", battle ensues.  The ability to connect, and disconnect, empires adds a huge amount of complexity to the map, and the hidden scores make one think that one is losing throughout the entire game.  

This does seem like it would require the right type of player: you've got to have thick skin (as you will get destroyed at some point), be extremely flexible, and willing to think through lots of possible moves on a turn to see what would benefit you the most (and benefit others the least).  

It took me two years after my first play to get in my second play; I hope my third play comes much quicker.

A little hard to grasp at first, this game really shinned after a couple of times we played it. It's a little on the abstract side, which might turn some people off. However, it's very strategic and can be failry confrontational, depending on the players. A medium/heavy range game that can be a bit of a "brain-burner." 

Doesn't seem to get a lot of table time with my group. It does lack the "excitement" factor but a good game, none the less.

RATING: 9.65
Changed rating from 9.0 to 9.65 on 4/27/16 because having played this multiple times now, this game is FANTASTIC.

This classic game, rendered even more gorgeous by the reprint with its gorgeous art and chunky plastic pieces, is almost too good.  You get that classic "build an engine and watch it run" mechanic but most importantly - you build up into other people's cities and  then the fighting begins... and "control" of the economic engines of the game can and will change hands multiple times.

If you're looking for a classic game that is easy to learn and play but hard to master, this may be the game for you.

RATING: 10
I've seen other reviewers say that Tigris & Euphrates feels almost like a rediscovered game from the ancient world, one of those games that has persisted through history (much like Chess or Go). I'd tend to agree with that sentiment; the game just feels timeless.

I find Tigris to be an extremely creative and fluid game, not at all the dry abstract it's sometimes painted as being. It’s got a wonderful “life” to it that is almost purely based on the interactions of the players. I like watching how the board state changes over the course of the game; it very much reminds me of a time-lapse of civilizations rising and falling. So, though the game is certainly abstracted, for me it's not completely lacking in theme. Finally, on the randomness of the tile draw, this has never bothered me. It makes the game more tactical, and I enjoy the challenge of working with what I'm given. That said, the game provides options for mitigating tile draw either by taking the discard and refresh action or even by starting a conflict simply to use several tiles you don't really need for board position.

Egy játék után nem vonnék le messzemenő következtetéseket, mindenesetre az tény, hogy eddig nem győzött meg.

Szabályzata érthető, nem vészes, ráadásul logikusnak is mondható, így ezzel nem sok gond van.

Viszont nekem ez túlságosan absztrakt, a témája lehetne akár sertéshizlalda-üzemeltetés vagy etyeki szőlőtermesztés is az ókori város építgetés helyett.

Elméletben végtelen az újrajátszhatósága, gyakorlatban nehezen tudom elképzelni, hogy olyan sokat fogok játszani vele.

Lehet, hogy túl sokat vártam az örök klasszikustól, ami a BGG toplista felső fokát is megjárta...

Downgrading this game, which saddens me just a bit seeing as I was the WBC Tigris champion one year :/.

The game is simply too tactical for my taste. I have done very well over the years waiting until my turn to come, computing the most advantageous move given the existing board situation, and letting the chips fall where they may.

That's not to say the game isn't fun at all, it's just not one that I would readily recommend on a random gaming night. A nicely calibrated '5', which is exactly in the middle for me.

I have played several unregistered online games of this to get a feel as to if it was something I'd be interested in. The answer, unequivocally, is no. The actions feel meaningless, the level of abstraction is so high it could just as easily be themed with types of offal floating in a sewer as it could be ancient provinces vying for control of a kingdom, the tile draws add chaos without the game providing any way for the players to control or funnel the chaos, the rules are overly complex, and there are exceptions and exceptions to the exceptions. COMPLEXITY does not equal DEPTH!!!

Another piece of Eurotrash that needs to be punched in the face.

Too random for me, you make your plans and then the other player have a whole hand of a given coloured tiles.

Superb game that, when played right, is all about dramatic conflicts. I'm glad to have acquired this one off recommendations of Geek Buddies (not to mention a stellar rating here on BGG). It's a keeper.

A couple of its initial advantages have proven to be illusory: it's not as intuitive for many people as it was for me, making learning games somewhat excruciating (i.e., In Brass, I can understand why people don't get it at first. Here, seriously, you still don't get external conflicts?), and the two player game is weak (though I've yet to try the Nile board). The game becomes undeniably dull if someone musters a sizable lead and then crushes an attack or two; I've been on both sides of this situation and am glad one of those games wasn't my first.

UPDATE 1: I was momentarily little worried that successful play is a tad scripted, but was proven wrong on my very next game.

UPDATE 2: Nearly 30 games in, and this game is still blowing my mind. This might have to go to 10, or maybe become my only 9.

Fantastic. While aggressive and competitive, we have been surprised at how many non-gamers have loved it. Perhaps because it is so abstract and people are not scared away by high theme? Maybe we just have cut-throat friends. Some risk of analysis-paralysis, but sometimes all the fun is in placing a tile and watching the chaos ensue. Great game.

Really like it.  I'm not sure I'll get too many games out of my group because it's a little deep for them but I love Knizia and this is one of his best.  A lot going on.

I love this game--the bluffing, the spatial complexity, and especially the way losing kingdoms fragment before your eyes.  Especially shines as a 2-player game.

The best war game,you can plan a lot of think but must be careful because other player can really hurt you, sometimes the game is a little bit Irritate, because you pick some random tiles during the game and this can give the victory to other player because they have greater luck, i would like to try the alternative maps in the future because they give more possibility to construct monuments, the rest is just great.

One of my favorite strategy games, people who don't like it will point to the randomness of the tile draw when it comes to who wins conflicts. But you have to bide your time and build up your strength in the color you want to attack in. Move your leaders around to avoid conflicts in the mean time. And you must have patience, think things through before you start random conflicts.

Második kapudrog volt nekem: a Zooloretto megvétele után kezdtem keresni, hogy milyen társasjátékok vannak Androidra, így akadtam bele Knizia régi, de szerintem legjobb társasába. Amikor felbukkant egy használt verzió, le is csaptam rá.
Egyszerű szabályokkal operáló társasjátékról van szó, nincs sok-sok apró megjegyzendő dolog. Egy térkép, 156 lapka 4 fajtából, pár kiegészítő faelem elég a változatos és érdekes játékhoz. Több fajta stratégia csaphat össze: békés együttélés és terjeszkedés, a folytonos harc a másik féllel, vagy egyszerűen megpróbálni egy-egy vezért jó ütemben becsempészni az ellenséghez.

The simplicity and originality of the rules and gameplay, versus the complexity of the strategy and tactics, are remarkable. I feel that more should have been done to avoid the sense that there's a distinct first-player advantage.... but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. I love the natural way that alliances emerge in this game in a way that's totally unlike any other abstract game--much more like a social deduction or bluffing game. It's usually best to hitch some of your leaders to other players' empires to make the cost/benefit ratio of two empires attacking each other more complex: this discourages mindless assaults and encourages more machiavellian play. An older game that holds up beautifully.

As the game map develops the tensions ramps us with conflicts breaking out and players poring over ways to make their hand of tiles work on the map to disrupt their opponent's scoring base (eg monuments). The mid and end game are where all the fun is at and T&E gets there pretty quickly with experienced players. There isn't much long term planning required, more short term planning of tile play.

T&E's counterintuitive rules about external and internal conflict and the scoring around leaders rather than territories make T&E a tough learning curve for novices. It really takes 4-5 games for T&E to shine through. Also, players need to initiate combat and break up high scoring turtling players, so gamers who don't like conflict want a game of applying vengeance won't like T&E. In short, T&E isn't for newbies who don't like war-like games.

A friend of mine describes this game as one of those where "the mists rise" after multiple plays and I couldn't have put it better myself.  

In fact these kind of games - the one's where you don't quite "get it" for a few plays hold the most appeal to me.  Could be the sign of an enquiring mind, could be a sign that I'm thick!  Either way, it's a damned good game!

Played only the iOS version, which doesn't take 2-3 hours, more like 20 minutes. I can see why it is considered such a classic, but after only a few games I still can't seem to figure out how the fighting works. 

The mechanism seems to be pretty dependent on the tiles you draw, since you need certain colours to be able to win the fights. But then again, this will probably even out with more plays, at least if you play with more than 2 players.

It's all about your plans going screwy and having to adapt to the current situation, as the board can go topsy-turvy at the drop of a hat. Tactics tend to be more important than long-term strategy. Extremely intense, at least as far as the domain of board games will allow. Really a top-notch game.

The game is pretty abstract but still manages to capture the feel of civilizations growing, evolving, clashing, and newer ones rising from the ashes of fallen ones. Whoa.

Awesome gem by Reiner Knizia, his masterpiece!  One of the best boardgames ever invented!! Perfect for 4p.  Lots of strategy, but some people complain it has too much luck.  I have always felt that the luck element is just right; i.e., it is totally immersive and rewarding to adjust one's complex strategy to the luck of the draw.

Waw...  I'm deeply impressed with this game.  Of all of Knizia's games I have played so far this is the best, and IMO very deservedly in the top 3 here on BBG.  Forget the (anti)snobbery, and try to at least play this game once.  It had me hooked from the go.  Great for 2 as well, regardless of what it says on the side of the Mayfair Edition box, where it incorrectly states it as a game for 3-4 players.

This almost abstract masterpiece of Knizia is a game that for me is difficult to judge: I love the design in itself, love all the thinking needed to win a game of this and yet... there are some things I'm still not really convinced of: is the runaway leader problem really in there somewhere? And what about luck? Can these two problems really cancel each other out (I've seen some established runaway leaders fall because of a well calculated risk and a lucky conflict)? Still, this is a great game...

RATING: 7
I gave this game a ton of chances before I finally grew to enjoy it, and even then I'm not sure if it's a game I think is all that great. There is a lot of underlying depth for a game where I would describe the rules as medium-weight. There are a couple of quirky things to remember, but nothing too bad. This is one of those games that really requires you to play it many, many times before you start to uncover what it's trying to accomplish. Right now, I'm finding that conflicts can sometimes be a bit too swingy for my tastes, and as such, it's very difficult to gauge who's winning. Overall I like this game, but it's one I like playing in short bursts. Bad losses in this game can really sour my mood. For some reason I still own it though. I wouldn't count it among my favorite games, but there's something about it that makes me want to keep it around.

A very interesting game with a very good scoring system. I love how you need to balance your playing style and tactics in order to maximize your lowest scoring colors. An excellent "your only as good as your weakest link mechanism". I'm still growing into this one and my rating certainly has upside to grow.

RATING: 10
Tigris & Euphrates must be the perfect game. Here is an element of go, where you place tiles to create kingdoms and score points from them. Here is an element of chess, where you maneuver your pieces for attack and/or defence. Here is an element of the classic civilization building, where you improve your kingdom through monuments and buildings.

However, this is not a peaceful game without player interaction. Conflicts come in two interesting shapes. In internal conflicts you plant your dynasty members in your opponents' kingdoms with the objective of overthrowing them and reap the benefits for yourself. In external conflicts the clashes of expanding borders may form one stronger kingdom for a winner or leave the two kingdoms weaker after the fierce strife.

But it does not end there. There is no such thing as "your" kingdom, they are only there to serve your dynasty's interests (i.e. generate victory points) and may (should!) be abandoned when they no longer serve any purpose.

Finally, in this chaos of rising and falling civilizations you need to find a balanced growth because it is not your strongest area that awards you the victory, it is your weakest area. The game is simple but the depth of the gameplay is immense.

This is a great game but for some reason doesn't capture my enjoyment.  You can never do much to defend a lead, unless the other players get unlucky and can't pull reds...  Of course you can always bluff, but sometimes random play just gets the best of you and allows someone else to win.

So here it is, the first 10 in my collection.  This is the kind of game I dream about (no, really) and the type of game my thoughts keep returning to time after time.  Although the rules could be better explained, the mechanics are simple - you take your choice twice and take the points.  From this humble ruleset, however, empires rise and fall, and conflicts can turn the board into a ruined landscape, and I haven't even mentioned the scoring yet, which ensures that you never know really if or how far you might be ahead.

Awesome, truly awesome.  Everybody should play this at least once, and most should own a copy.

On a l'impression que tous les coups se valent, et pourtant, il n'en est rien!

On a l'impression que tout est pareil, et pourtant, tout n'est qu'asymétrie!

On peut au premier abord trouver le jeu très austère, et pourtant, chaque action laisse place au suspens!...

Ce jeu requiert de bien planifier et de bien choisir où, quand et dans quelle séquence positionner ses chefs et "ses" tuiles, de manière à se rendre le moins vulnérable possible face à d'éventuels conflits. Comme il existe deux types de conflits, il est indispensable de faire un bon usage de toutes nos tuiles, et particulièrement des rouges. 

Le paradoxe est vite créé: Encercler ses chefs de tuiles rouges augmente leur défense en situation de conflit interne; mais: 1) moins de tuiles rouges en main complique les tentatives d'initier soi-même ces conflits; 2) négliger de poser des tuiles de la même couleur que son chef le rend vulnérable face à un conflit externe; 3) conséquemment, laisser derrière soi une case "forte" (entourée de tuiles rouges) suite à une défaite en conflit externe laisse cette "case forte" disponible pour un chef adverse!...

Ce jeu arrime combativité et complicité. Ne l'oublions pas, tous nos chefs ne se battent pas contre tous les chefs de l'adversaire! Il est tout à fait possible de cohabiter avec des chefs adverses, du moment qu'ils ne partagent pas la même couleur! Mais bien sûr, lorsque plusieurs joueurs dessinent simultanément l'expansion d'un royaume, cette expansion ne prend pas la forme et ne va pas systématiquement dans la direction souhaitées!

Attention, les territoires ne sont jamais acquis! Nous travaillons à obtenir le contrôle, puis maintenir notre contrôle de zones et de royaumes; mais un royaume n'est JAMAIS à soi pour de bon - ou du moins, durant la partie, on ne peut en être certain! Il faut être créatif et il faut tenir compte de l'ENSEMBLE du plateau de jeu!

N'ayez pas peur de "concéder" une couleur à tel joueur, et telle couleur à un autre joueur. L'idée n'est pas d'avoir le pointage le plus élevé dans TOUTES les couleurs! Laissons l'orgueil de côté! Il n'y a aucun mal à ce qu'un adversaire obtienne un pointage très élevé dans une ou deux couleurs...

À partir du 2/3 de la partie, il faut principalement se concentrer sur les couleurs faibles de chaque joueur. Obtenir des points, ou empêcher l'adversaire d'en faire de même, il faut parfois alterner la stratégie s'il n'est pas possible de faire les deux en même temps!

La position finale importe peu, car nous pouvons avoir nos quatre chefs en dehors du jeu, mais néanmoins gagner! L'important est la couleur de nos points! D'ailleurs, il n'est pas interdit de volontairement prendre du retard dans l'une d'elle dans la première moitié de la partie. Dans une bonne position, il est plus facile d'augmenter qu'un seul pointage faible plutôt que plusieurs! Alors tant pis si on ne pige jamais de tuiles vertes! On planifie en conséquence, on essaie de construire un monument vert même s'il n'est pas immédiatement sous notre contrôle, et on aura tôt ou tard l'occasion d'augmenter cette couleur faible (conflits, catastrophes...)

Un jeu totalement différent à deux, trois ou quatre joueurs, et quelque peu sadique à plusieurs, car la stratégie commande parfois de s'attaquer au plus faible plutôt qu'au plus fort.

Bref, ce jeu mérite d'être joué et rejoué, car, avouons-le, la toute première partie est totalement déroutante!

note: Je préfère de beaucoup la seconde carte (14 trésors) de la deuxième édition. On tombe moins dans la course aux trésors.

À deux joueurs ou trois joueurs: 10/10 si les joueurs ont une expérience relativement équivalente;
À quatre joueurs: 8/10: le jeu est alors plus spectaculaire mais à la fois un peu moins stratégique et un peu trop court...

Horrible game.  I hate almost every aspect of its game mechanics.  I won the 2nd game I ever played, but I still did not enjoy it.  The ownership of "kingdoms" and the initiation of conflict/combat is really confusing & annoying.  I was confused & frustrated with Puerto Rico when I first played it, but I learned to understand it and like it.  I can't imagine ever coming to have fun playing Tigris & Euphrates.  Not for me.

This game is sorta like Chess with four players, but alot more fun.  A true classic brainbuster that is fun to play and simple enough to teach.  Very deep game in terms of strategy and knowing how to place leaders and use combat to your advantage to score trading/religion/settlement/farming points in the most balanced manner.  Just the right mix of luck, which is relatively low and manageable due to ability to cycle tiles.

The more that I play this game, the more that I appreciate it.  It packs a lot of strategy and conflict in a surprisingly short game, and I really like the way the best of the worst scoring system affects your play.  I also enjoy the assymetry to the game, and the fact that the gameboard has better locations and worse locations.  Finally, the fact that this game is still fairly opaque to me definitely intrigues me.

It doesn't scale that well across its player range, as is often the case with games like these, but that is a minor complaint for a great game.  A stronger theme would probably be a good thing, but I'm happy with the game exactly as it is.

Area influence/tile placement game from Knizia. Lay tiles and leaders from your country to score points, but conflicts can occur within your own kingdom or with other kingdoms. Score is the minimum of your earned points in the four colors. This is Knizia's first game I played in March 1998. Since then, I have been playing his designs. Good solid game, unique scoring system. Some battles near the end can have a decisive impact on the game.

Strategic abstract with the following mechanics:

Area Control / Area Influence
Hand Management
Set Collection
Tile Placement

Have played 2 and 3 player. Wondering how it is with 4. Really like how you don't know who is leading the game till the very end due to the hidden scoring mechanism. I have found that this mechanism  keeps my gf from getting angry with me during game play!

Some claim there is [i]luck[/i] in this game, particularly involving the tile draw. However, the more experienced players are claiming that skill will trump this random factor. I suppose it is similar as in card play: one must know what to do with the cards dealt to him.

Wish I could play this game more.

This game is like a good European film;  I don't really feel excited about watching it beforehand, but once the theatre darkens and the movies rolls, I'm totally engrossed. 

There's something about E&T that just seems kind of dry and unengaging - it's not a game I ever think about while I'm not playing it. But when I am playing it that little board and those tiles just suck me right in. I've played 50 minute games that seemed like they must have taken 3 hours because of the amount of brainpower that went into them. A fantastic game.

***Rating based on iOS edition***

Have this on the iPad mini. Really like the game, very unique with some good strategy that's not overdone. Luck is minimised and interaction is integrated fantastically, which is also necessary to master the game. Everything is automated on the iPad which makes the game very quick, I expect the physical edition would have a lot of down time continually counting strength of colours, especially during war. Unfortunately rematch button doesn't function correctly on the iPad.

Let me start with: This is a complex game. 
That said, once you have the basics down, the variety of ways to play are simply astounding. Aggressive, defensive, isolationalist, wow. And the game can change so quickly. Link up regions in the wrong order or settle conflicts without enough planning and your "sure win" can crumble before you. 

And I especially like that your smallest resource determines your placing; you can go all out and have a stack of Green cubes but if you let your Blue ones fall behind, you're hosed. You have to balance all aspects to have a chance to win.

Top tier Knizia game, second only to the much lesser-known Rheinlander for me.  I don't think the abstractness is any more prevalent than in most of his other titles.  The "most of the least" victory condition is something I love because it forces players to digest the game in its entirety.

It also includes probably my favorite methods of victory point scoring in any such game to date.

However, for some reason I have trouble getting it to the table. While I do like it, I find that other games more closely tied to their themes, or less abstracted overall, are my first suggestions. And it just seems too oblique or too reliant on those agonising choices to be inflicted upon non-gamers. As such the score has fallen more than I'd like, but I barely ever play it. A pity.

I have owned this game forever (ok for sometime) and just played it for the first time recently.  At first I was unsure as I'm really not that big on tile games, and I thought the game looked a little too abstract.  I'm just not that big of an abstract gamer.  Turns out, I feel the theme is actually pretty good for the game, and...it works!  Not exactly as abstract as I once thought either as the theme helps it along some.  I like this game, and I'm really interested in giving it some more tries.  I'm thinking that with a few more plays my rating for it will go up.

This is my personal perception of the game, which, I suppose, we are all entitled too. The game's artwork is magnificent and the quality of the components superb, but as usual Knizia designs game mechanics to show off his mathematical genius. Everything is abstracted to the level of a shape-recognition IQ test, with all theme being thoroughly dessicated. Playing many Knizia games is like drawing a tattoo on oneself while watching your movements through the mirror.

There is clearly a nice game in there, but it is too clinical for me.

I purchased this in mid Dec 2005.

Wow . . . a new favorite.  Easily in the top three.  I do think the game finishes a little too fast, as one can't really deploy long term strategies all that well (i.e. amassing tiles of a certain color, detrenching a strong ruler through consistenly clever temple play followed by internal conflict).  The problem is that one doesn't score while planning such longer attacks, while the target leader can score the color and not care (because he has already scored enough) that he is eventually unseated.  This makes me want to be less aggressive in my play, yet you'll lose if you don't win a few external conflicts, because you just can get VP's as quickly through tile placement as you can through well planned attacks.

Anyway, there's a lot more to this game than I can get in a play or two, so . . . until then, I'll end with very high praise.

Tigris & Euphrates is a good game, and one that I'd be willing to play pretty much anytime. It has unique mechanics that make for interesting play. But I will never own it. Why? Because I can't actually describe the game effectively to someone who has never played it. Its just so abstract and strange and a real brain-burner to boot. As such, none of my friends would be interested in playing, so there is no point in buying it. Still, T&E is a classic, just not for everyone.

A final note: To satisfy my craving for more of the game, I bought the app from the iTunes store. I still can't explain T&E, but now I have some bots to play against and I've a better understanding of the game.

Fantastic.  One play where I was still struggling with the strategy and some of the mechanics and I could see that I would and do love this game.  A must buy, even though I played with another newb and taught by someone who is somewhat inexperienced.

Each time it plays out very differently, even with the same group of players.  This is undoubtedly because a lot of your tactics is going to be dictated by tiles drawn.  I still don't get the feeling that it's that luck-based, however.

Incredibly evil game. Build up your kingdoms, but watch out for people taking them over and/or blowing them up in one fell swoop! 

It often comes down to taking things other people have built and beating them on the head with it. The catastrophes just take evilness to a new level.

The emergent dynamics of this game from a simple and unique ruleset are fascinating.

After all this time playing, I still feel like I have no idea of what's going on in this game or how to approach it. If I went away from a game having an idea of what I did wrong, or what I could change, then I'd appreciate it more even if I didn't win, but I just don't get that. It seems like what I did wrong was not have enough green tiles.

After playing first game I had no idea when I should attack or what to do in general. Second game made sure I like the game just not sure how much. For me as a bad loser it's good sign if I like game even if I have always been dead last. You can be quite flexible with your moves but obviously you must take into consideration what tiles you draw and how to best utilize them. A really, really good game.

Update: I still have managed to lose all of my 4 games but love the game! Increased rating from 8 to 9.

RATING: 7
I really wanted to like this game, but for me it lacks that certain something I look for. The theme feels artificially added, to give an abstract game some umph. I like how some of the parts work, but the combat mechanic really makes me feel queezy (it is sudden, brutal, and often comes down to luck) and is the main reason I dislike the game. This is my impression after four plays. I will play it again, though. I want to give it another shot, as I still want to like this game.

I have seen this game referred to as "an experience", and I would agree. It has the perfect balance of strategy and chance for my taste, and every action in the game provides satisfying feedback. I love how it manages to be simultaneously intense and relaxing. The only thing that could make it better is a finely crafted wooden playset.

Some of my feelings "I've been playing some Tigris & Euphrates; I've really fallen in love with it. I'm a sucker for hand management games, and this one takes that mechanic, which is usually a hard, grubby little thing--like a fig--and makes it broad, airy, and spreadable, like fig pudding. Both the scoring of actual points (through the beautiful leader tokens) and the way you compare them (highest of the lowest color wins) are ingenious (and also similar to Ingenious, which I haven't played). I'll be playing this game for a long time."

RATING: 7
Widely regarded as Knizia's summit - a feisty, rich game that leaves lots of room for strategy, tactics and interaction. Euphrat & Tigris would stand higher if it wasn't for the luck of the draw, kingmaking issues and the enormous difficulty to catch up with a player once they leads the game: there's often a plan B, but it must be spotted quickly and even then getting the wrong tiles can sometimes be really painful. Lacking red tiles for several rounds means your game is pretty much doomed to failure... and it can still take some time until it ends).

Euphrat & Tigris can be enjoyed by players of similar level; if there are less experienced players they will most probably learn through 90 minutes of relentless tough love try after try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Un Knizia. Molto profondo e cerebrale dalla meccanica tutto sommato semplice anche se non immediata. Adeguata anche la durata del gioco non molto lunga (anzi potrebbe finire troppo presto). Il calcolo alternativo del punteggio finale per decidere i punti vittoria ricorda Himalaya ma soprattutto Samurai (altro gioco di Knizia), ma nel complesso Tigris & Euphrates risulta molto più articolato e gratificante. La grafica non è molto coinvolgente e l'ambientazione è praticamente assente. Alternativa l'idea di attribuire 'le pedine' di ogni giocatore non in base ai classici colori ma al differente logo (alle prime partite questa differenza potrebbe infastidire). Esiste un gioco di carte che cerca di emularlo, sempre di Knizia, ma soprattutto esiste la versione tedesca, praticamente identica visto che il gioco è indipendente dalla lingua, che però si chiama Euphrates & Tigris e costa molto meno.

RATING: 7.5
Each player builds 4 parallel empires and scores the worst one. Conflicts occur when 2 leaders of the same type occur in one empire or when 2 empires come in contact. Due to the scoring mechanism, the most aggressive player isn't necessarily the winner. 

The play is deep, but the rules are relatively simple.

RATING: 6.8
Wow. So many options. So much to do. So much freedom! I love being spared from the tight restraints of other big-box classics, and there are shadows of Go in the simple rules propagating so many choices. I expect it will take a bunch of plays to understand the nuances of this game, and thankfully I can't really get enough of it. Hard to get to the table for some reason, though.

Played this not long after getting into boardgames.  I found it a bit confusing and I didn't really know what I was doing.  [Initially rated it a 6 after one play] I generally like Knizia-designed games and I'm aware that this game has a very high rating here on BGG.  I fully expect that with a better understanding of the rules and more games under my belt I could come to see the goodness of this game and raise my rating.  Consider this to be an initial rating after 1 play only.  
UPDATE 12 May 2008 - Picked up a new Mayfair edition in shrink through a math trade for my Circus Maximus.  Previous owner was nnf1.

Deep, deep game. I do like these games that give you limitless options on a turn, but it can get overwhelming. At least it gives you some direction with the starting tiles, your hand, and the rivers--otherwise I'd be as lost as I am when I play Go.

The depth of strategy in choosing when to start conflicts, which to resolve first, how to build your civilizations, where to place your support tiles, when to use disasters, and how best to exploit opponents' unstable civs is insane. Brilliant game.

I know I'm late to this party, but MAN is this a good game! This is the best "abstract" war game, disguised as a tile-laying euro, I've ever seen.

The way the player's pieces works is a little counter-intuitive at first, as are the different ways to fight with other players, but eventually it becomes second nature.

The fact that "diagonal doesn't count" in this game, really makes it better...AND worse in a lot of instances.

Never has so much been done before with just a mere four shapes and colors.

RATING: 8
For a game that is relatively straight forward, the first couple of plays, especially learning to play from the rules are really confusing when it shouldn't be.

Now I've played a few times I think this is a real winner.  It plays rather gamey like chess and plays well 2-4.  

Lots of difficult and tricky decisions.  It's great to bait an opponent into challenging you when you have a large amount of that colour tiles behind your screen.

I can see myself playing this a lot in the future.

[b]Tigris and Euphrates[/b] was traded away for Among the Stars and Qwixx 12/18/14.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I still think this is an amazing game and hopefully I will get to play it more. This is definitely a game that requires repeated play in order to start to pick up all the nuances of game play. As is often joked about, this has been a game I've brought to meet ups and it's usually ignored. I was hoping with the reprint that there would be some renewed interest, but so far I haven't seen it. 

I am glad to have played this classic game, it provides a lot of insight into modern board game design and in my opinion is a must play game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]Absolutely loved my first play of this with my family. 
It only took one play to realize why this game is considered a classic. 

- Brilliant scoring system; you need to make sure that you are scoring points consistently in all four colors.
- Love the interaction between the leaders, there is only conflict if two of the same type of leader are in the same territory.
- Two types of conflict (revolution versus war) which are both caused/resolved using different tiles.
- Accessible to my older kids (9 and 12), but they have played a lot of other games.
- I am one of those people that find this game thematic (even though you are collecting colored cubes for vp). I thing it is interesting to watch the territories grow and expand and then splinter off into different territories. The monuments make thematic sense, they are the artistic pinnacle of each civilization. 
Granted everything takes place on a very macro level, but I think the civilization building theme makes sense.[/i]

A lot of meat to this game.  TONS of options and tough choices. Like Hansa Teutonica it has alot more conflict than most Euros. It has a really cool feel of civilizations appearing and disappearing, especially for being so abstract.

One of the best euro games I've ever played. It's balanced (except for the slight disadvantage for the 4th player), has a lot of tough choices, and it is  full of conflict. Brilliant design.

RATING: 10
Sweet game!  Learned face-to-face at a game group.  I then read the awesome annotated Tigris and Euphrates geeklists and learned a lot.  I have since played a few email games here on the site.  The design of the game is almost perfect.  I still plain out enjoy RRT more, but that's in spite of some hinks and flaws in the game design.  

I originally felt a little lost playing T&E--the longterm view of what might happen was so hard to get my mind around, that many of my moves felt random or completely tactical.  It's like Chess at first until you develop a sense of your whole side interconnected instead of a bunch of individual pieces.  I thought that lost feeling would be more of a barrier to getting my group to play, but some on my wife's side of the family have really taken to it now.  

I love how many possibilities and clever moves exist.  The game can constantly swing in unexpected directions and there's always a little bit of tension as someone can drop an internal conflict at any time with a lucky red draw.  I love this game!

RATING: 6
A bit of a classic, staple Knizia game, not my favourite of his games. You can get screwed if you are unlucky the right tiles, and critical game win/lose things can depend on the luck of whether someone else has the right tiles at the right time. I've won games by doing nothing and just being lucky enough to have just the right tiles when attacked 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Like most of Kinizia's games, the scoring mechanic is wonderful.  I think that this works best in T&E and Samurai.  Here you determine winner by comparing the volume of cubes in your *weakest* color.

While I have the German Edition, would love to have a back-up copy (if my tiles were ever damaged I would cry as the USA edition is not even close in quality of game pieces).

RATING: 7
I recommend 2 players and that the game is seen as a very good replacement over playing chess. If played properly, one will be spending substancial ammounts of time thinking about all the different option, what their consequences will be and what will the other player(s) be able to do next.

3~4 players will mean lots of time waiting for your turn and, with so many players, you can't really spend that time preparing your turn since alot will change in the mean time.

If played 3~4 players in a not-so-much-thought way, though, i guess it will be a less brutal struggle between 2 players and it will flow decently...

RATING: 7
I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did (it's a game of math and strategy which are not my strong suits) but I managed to push past it and really dive into the game. I knew it was a reprint of a nearly twenty-year old game when designers were just learning to not rely on dice or cards; I was skeptical of it keeping my attention beyond the third turn. But I was wrong. While not exactly "fun", "exciting" or "tense," I was never bored or uninterested in other player's turns. I can imagine that in 3 or 4 player games, AP is multiplied but between Paulo and I, it was never an issue. I really like the scoring mechanic of only scoring the resource you have the LEAST amount of; it makes you reevaluate your strategy every turn and try new things. While not as thematic or fun for your basic Euro, Tigris & Euphrates's strategy runs deep. I'll play it again.

Наверное это лучшая игра в которую мне удалось сыграть в этом году. Действительно замечательная игра для Книзия. Каркассон теперь убит на нашем настольном столе. Суперстратегический, многоходовый пазл про жизнь древних шумеров, неплохо сбалансированный и для двух игроков. После игры остается ощущение не зря потраченного времени и в голове все еще прокручиваются возможные выигрышные комбинации. В общем всем любителям полу-абстрактных, умных игр рекомендовано к ознакомлению. Удручает качество русской локализации - картонные крашенные огрызки и отсутствие монументов. Но игра все равно классная. Покупайте сразу немецкую версию.

50+ plays. A classic gamer game that has stood the test of time and maintains lasting appeal. There's early establishment, then comes the drama of the wars which can dramatically alter the landscape and provide rich opportunities for clever moves. The need to obtain a balanced score across the 4 colours drives decisions, and means sometimes seemingly obvious moves are not the best ones, making for surprise. Excellent.

RATING: 4
What I like:
- It is a very well designed game
- The rules really are relatively simple, for such a deep game

What I don't like:
- Shared ownership
- Lots of conflict
- Brain-burner
- Not enough red tiles
- Having players be shapes, not colors, is disorienting
- You have to think outside the box to find the really creative (sometimes counter-intuitive) moves

I didn't hate it as much as I thought I might. Our 3p learning game only took 100 minutes, which wasn't bad at all. The end game dragged a bit. As expected, I didn't like the shared ownership, nor the constant conflict. Basically, it's not a style of game I like.

The weight of 3.6 really reflects the depth, not the rules complexity. I would give the rules complexity about a 2.5.

Grabbed a copy on the recommendation of BGG that it was one of Knizia's finest.  I'm a fan of his work (though not of his seeming problems with combining gameplay with 'story'), and I've been pleased with what I see in T&E.  Played one 2-player game to date (more an attempt to see the rules in action than anaything else) and I'm hoping to play again with more players.

I have only played this once, and I think we didn't have it quite sorted out about the conflicts. Since my aunt was relying heavily on the "conflict" strategy to win, I didn't like that at the moment. But I believe in a subsequent game on another day when I wasn't playing, our regulars worked out the finer details of waging conflicts. So next time around, that will hopefully be clearer....one thing that frustrates me is when we can't come to a consensus about what the rules mean. You end up spending more time arguing about the rules and what they mean, and trying to convince each other of your opinions, and less time playing the game. 

But, other than that...I enjoyed the theme, and I thought that the fact that you were ranked according to your weakest color, thereby forcing you to try to balance the different areas, was a very COOL mechanism. So I'd definitely want to give this another go.

Updated Mar 09 (18 months later). I've forgotten how to be effective! Although did rally at end and came in 2nd in a 4p.

I've come in first or second in this game so many times using diversification & not much foresight & strategy. I'm unclear what I'm doing. That's not good.

I'm not a huge fam of hidden scoring. Not sure I need to play this again.

It took me some time to get hold of this because it has been out of print for so long, but I managed to pick it up in a trade on BGG and I am glad that I did. 

I’ve only played it a few times but I love the way this game plays out and I can see that there are a lot of possible strategies in this game. I like the theme and the mechanics; external conflicts can be brutal! I was worried that it might cause a lot of AP, but in my group the game moved at a nice pace. I can’t understand why this hasn’t been reprinted recently.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Once you get your head around how the conflicts work, this game really has a very simple ruleset. But I do not think anyone will ever completely explore all the depth this game has to offer. There is plenty of room for devious and clever play and Knizia seems to have purposely left out unnecessary chrome that would have bloated the game.  As is, this is a classic game that requires a high level of thought and skill to play well despite the relatively simple rule set.   True, some do complain about the randomness of the tile draw, but games are rarely decided by this.  Good players are able to use their precious actions and the hands they are dealt to make other players miserable (in a good way of course).  There are also complaints that the any theme is completely pasted on.  But that is rubbish.  When you start a war between your opponents, watch their kingdoms become fractured ruins, and you rush in to plunder what is left behind, THAT is theme.   A genuine masterpiece and a classic.

I'm not as high on this game as many people, but I do find it enjoyable.  It has a lot more conflict than most Euros, but is way, way more abstract than most conflict-driven games.  There are some luck issues with tile draws, but I'm not sure how big of a deal that is.  The major appeal of the game is being able to do something both clever and game-changing, and you might spend your entire game trying to come up with such a move.

Yes, it's a 10. Perfect game. Albeit, not for everyone as it's somewhat abstract. I've played scores of games on the Geek, and 3-4 face to face. I love this game. Geekbuddies rate it a 7.6. 

10/6/12: I have almost played this game out, but only it's online versions. First it was on BGG, now on iOS. Lowering to a 9 to be true to my current feelings. Still awesome, some of its limitations are now becoming apparent to me after 100 plays: 1. Dry theme does not appeal to any face to face opponents in my circle making it extremely difficult to get to table. 2. Very difficult to catch up to the leader. 3. Experienced players will generally destroy new people - it would take 10  games to really even begin to challenge a couple if veterans. 4. Very easy for a new player to throw the game out of whack by boneheaded plays. 

I have just reached the point where I've almost played this out. 

Still an amazing game and the arc of play and learning was one of the best game experiences I've had. I recommend everyone try this, and savor it.

Oct 2014: I have played a ton of games on the iOS App, and easily more than 50 on the BGG app when it was up. There seems to be very little interest in this game in my gaming groups - it's what I would call a "heavy German-style" game today, and my friends are pretty stuck on Agricola, Power Grid, Pandemic, Innovation/Uchronia/Impulse, Star Realms, and Chess. I don't see the core list changing much, a few new games will be tried now and then. The trend seems to be towards shorter and lighter games these days.

Comment: Love the game but just can't get it to the table. People in my group really dislike this game for some reason. Its got plenty of tension, conflict, theme and a reasonable play time.

TRY Feb/04 (BGG): Very nice game on BGG - well done, Aldie and Yekrats!  Quite enjoyable, and a simple interface.

With a real board, I could see the potential for missed conflicts, and incorrect scoring.  No concern of that when playing online!

Has a feel of chess-like, but with more players (game is better with 3 or 4, in my opinion).

The game has simple rules but with three or four players it is guaranteed this gives you a tough challenge.

My score got increasing on and on by playing on BGG: at first it seemed slow, complex, pointless. It seemed there was no way to understand when to put a tile and when to keep it in a hand. Now I feel that it's great, although still very luck-dependant. There are many possible strategies and they depend from your cards but also from your personal mood and opponents' behaviour, making strategic like a wargame without the complexity and coldness of it. Everyone should try it here on BGG.
One note about a under-stimated rule: the fact of changing up to 6 tiles when is needed reduces randomness (although it's still heavy) and increases strategy.

Increased the rating to 10 once I played the digital version against the AI. It is a little difficult to grasp some of the concepts until you see them in action from an experienced player. For instance, all of the following points were lost on me during my first 15 plays of this game:
  - The depth of the warfare scoring aspect as a catch-up mechanism is superbly done. 

  - The monument mechanism as a double-edged sword (creating one making you more vulnerable to warfare, but a rewarding point catch-up mechanism) is well done. 

   -The vulnerability to revolt that comes with playing red tiles, and thus the strategy in blocking them off and using them sparingly is well done.

RATING: 8
A combination of Knizia and tiles cannot go wrong.
Somehow this game assumes that everyone will harass each other and prevent from expanding.
The problem occurs if some want to build their kingdom in peace and others are too busy to spare their leaders there.

RATING: 10
Wow! Just an amazing game! Sometimes the "bad" tile draws force a player into a specific strategy.  If the player doesn't play to the unlikely tile draws , they'll say the game is too luck based because they didn't get what they think they should have.I view it as the player needs to adapt to the situation.  The luck may decide a game here and there when someone on defense pulls 5 black tiles from thier hand to win a key external war, but better tactics will still win most of the games.

Too much luck in the brick draw according to me. Got one game totally destroyed by getting no red bricks and that was that game. For a deep strategy game to be so dependent on lucky draws I think it is over rated here on BGG.

Otherwise a good game.

Update 6/16/10: having played it about 9 times now, I have come to really love this game.  It's elegantly simple, yet there are nearly infinite possible strategies and tactics to try.  The rise and fall of civilization is so beautifully recreated in abstraction.

Original 2009 comment:  This one is a head trip.  It is so hard not to think of an area as "mine" and realize you can put your pieces anywhere.  I also love that you have no idea how well your opponent may be doing.  I'd like to come up with more stable screens though, because I always knock mine over 3 or 4 times in a game, ensuring everyone knows how well I'm doing!

I own the IOS version of this game. I am glad I have only paid $1 to try this classic out. This game feels like a combination of Knizia's mathy game with an abstract like Go. The game is very much free form so I can see the depth and complexity that comes with such freedom but it also means this game is less forgiving in mistakes made. I got slaughtered bad by the easiest AI in my first game. I am sure it is a great game, but I think abstracts are not my cup of tea. My rating is based on my willingness to play again so this only gets a 5. :)

---- Update ----
I finally got to play this game at my local meetup with the FFG reprint. I can see why this game came back to print because it is an interesting game to play with players and not computer AI. It has an abstract feel to it (duh it's an abstract game) that feels similar to Through the Desert and Go. The scoring mechanism is what makes this game great. In order to win you have to focus on all colors.

The game clicked for me 2/3 way through and I enjoy the ending where it was a big push to the finish and a huge battle at the end. War wins the game! And that comes with careful planning and hand management.

Ratings from 5 -> 7.

A dismal treatment of an outstanding theme.  When, oh when, will Reiner Knizia get it right?  He's made a half-dozen or so civilization-making games, NONE of which succeed as well as even Settlers of Catan in giving you any sense of civilization building.  I'd rather perform second-derivative calculus than stare any more at the (fairly ugly) abstract pieces while I wonder again why I would care about the utterly abstract and pointless rules for chit-laying which make up 99% of this game.

Okay, I've played this a few times.  My problem with it is twofold.  #1, I got into this game later than everyone I play it with, and they smoke me. That's not that bad, but I realize that #2, victory is highly dependent on conflicts, which I'm having trouble getting excited about.  You may set up for a conflict, but one of two things seems to happen: a) you lose because your opponent had a bunch of tiles, or b) you win and are weakened for the next player.  The feeling of being susceptible to attack is distressing and keeping track of everyone's score is too much of a pain.  

Plus I never get any red tiles, and explaining the different conflicts and how they're resolved is a pain in the patuckus.  All this is just a way of saying I find the game a bit more trouble than it's worth.

This game frustrated me when I started playing it because I was too attached to cities that I built up and would be devastated when it was taken from me by one forced conflict instigated by a third party not involved in building the city or monument at all - (ahem...sirjeyhmis!)  but once I learned to let go of my possessiveness, this game became great!  Fairly simple to learn and play, a challenge to master being a collecter of ALL goods!

*Finally* played this.  What a weirdly counter-intuitive game. A bunch of abstruse, abstract rules, with a theme that does nothing to help you through them.  That is, the theme offers no reference points for understanding a very interesting but rather strange system.  So there's no "well, obviously traders would act in such-and-such a fashion, therefore this piece works like this....."  Still, it was a very interesting play, and by the end I was getting the hang of it.  The rating is thus provisional.

RATING: 9
This is a very solid game that doesn't fall on luck as much as some make it out to be.  Yeah, you can get bad tiles but a good chunk of the game is trying to make use with what you have so you don't have to use portions of your turn exchanging tiles.  The only thing that I don't like about this game is I just have a hard time finding people that want to play it.  The group that I play with has of late been in love with deduction games like Secret Hitler, Avalon, and Burke's Gambit.  Partly, due to if we have a large player count we can't play Tigris.  A lot of the play that I now get with the game is against the computer though there are websites like Triqqy where you can play it online.  It is a deep game that I would maybe compare to Go.  The tile component makes the game interesting in that it forces you  to play your hand.  You can't go into the game with a preordained strategy or opening every game.  The flip side though is that occasionally, you will get blown out of the water in a conflict that you were very sure you would win but your opponent just happened to have a bunch of tiles of that color.  That doesn't happen often but it does happen sometimes and if you aren't the sort of person who can live with a little uncertainty, you will feel like the game has cheated you.   That said, luck does play a role in this game but it is very much on the low end.  A good player will have no problems beating a new player, no matter what tile they draw.   The game also plays well from 2 - 4 players.  I find it surprisingly tactical with 2 players.   With 4 players, there is more stuff that can go on outside of your control or you were unable to plan for.  That doesn't make it worse for 4 players but just different.  All and all a great abstract game.

For a long time I had this at an 8. After several two and three player games I have decided to put this game in the 10 spot (I only have one other game at that rank).

If this game is dry then so is the vast majority of Euros. The game is exciting, it is nasty and cut-throat in every wonderful way. The choices are wide open every turn but with the heart breaking limit of actions that you are allowed.

Some complain about the luck of "tile drawing" Poo Poo on that. You may not be able to do what you would most wish you could do on a turn (but it wouldn't be a good game if you could) there are always many other strategic moves that you can make with what you have. Those who fail to grasp that concept, fail to grasp the game itself. Yes, you do have to plan ahead, that is the point as well.

I have never been in a place where I had less then two or three powerful choices to make.

Fantastic game that always ends much closer in scoring then you think.

Acquire's merge mechanics, Ingenious' "the lowest is your score" scoring, and euro style tile-laying a la Reef Encounter combine into this fascinating brain-burner.

This is Knizia's masterpiece and a good example of elegant, simple rules that turn into an absorbing and replayable game.

RATING: 8
This is by far my favourite game, not only of those I own but of those I have ever played.  The components are fantastic, lots of colours and chunky bits to handle.  Particularly that you can exchange your smaller “1” blocks for the larger “5” blocks, making it a lot easier to count up your score.  The scoring principles are great, where your lowest score in any of the colours is your final score (same as those you find in ingenious).  There are so many different tictacs, many that cause you to play quiet aggressively at times.  Also it is a hidden information game so nobody knows who has won until the very end.  It’s one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played, I always finish wanting to play another game and try a new tactic.  
This game is a must for any boardgamegeeker!!!!

An interesting cross between a civilization building game, territory expansion and abstract wargame.  Some interesting and unusual concepts to learn but once you've got your head around them, the game can be played quite quickly.  Oddly for a relatively lightweight game it can be quite harsh on players who make mistakes or get victimised.  As the game enters the late phases and the board fills up there's a danger of clashing with other players whether you want to or not!

Added after some more plays: I'd like to like this more - there's a lot to like - but there's a significant reliance on the luck of the tile draw which detracts too much from the skill element of the game.

Had this as my 10, but am going to 'be real' and reduce the number.  I don't think anything is a 10 at this point, as I have so many games that I want to play - E&T is a great one, definately worth a 9, but can't say with honesty that 'I always want to play it' as if it's the only game on my mind.  It's great - conflict, city building, intrigue, etc.. but it's being outshined.  Let the dust settle and we'll see where things stand.

When do I play this?:
Not all of the time.  It's best played with my friends who are very familiar with different types of games, who can absorb rules and see patterns well, and who love the subtle, yet drastic, nuances of the game.  It's just a great game, even though it can't be played (or enjoyed, for that matter) all of the time by everyone.

Quite unlike anything else I'd played until I tried Reef Encounter, which has some elements that feel similar but they are actually very different games.

The rules aren't too tricky, but it can take several plays to begin to see how to make more intelligent moves and plan ahead properly. The tile draw helps avoid it becoming too chess-like though.

Plays quite differently with only 2 players. There is more board space so it is possible to avoid each other most of the time. However, choosing to play more aggressively can yield better results & is more fun.

This game went up greatly in my opinion after the first six(teen) plays against the iPad. Once I got the hang of it (and could process that it is actually kinda thematic) I really warmed to it. 

It's not four player chess (because random tile draw) but I'm ok with random.

I started to reduce my rating since it's been a long time when I last played. However, playing on-line with the "geek" version reminded me what I love about this game: it is an angst filled puzzle in trying to get a better balance than your opponents. Most of the agony comes from not knowing for sure what scores and tiles lie behind your competitors screens. At present, the only gamer's game I really enjoy.

An innovative, original design and a classic of early Euro. It is already 10 years old, but it feels as fresh as ever. This is one game whose mechanics don't easily lend themselves to copying. Knizia's best, and deservedly at #2 right behind Puerto Rico. Although, depending on my mood Caylus could occupy the #2 position sometimes.  How about a draw at #2 for both?  This is a good example of why any single list of "Best of..." anything can not tell the whole story and can even be misleading.  Back to the game... yes, one of my all-time favorites. With two, it is as engaging as Chess.

There are two reasons I have not given it a 10. The first is the small amount of luck introduced when drawing tiles. The second is the player-induced chaos present in 4-player games (and to a lesser degree in 3-player games). Nonetheless, it is indisputably a masterpiece.

I probably shouldn't rate this highly regarded and deep game after only one play. But what I found was my opponent gaining a stranglehold on the all-important monuments that I just couldn't release. She just about doubled my score. It is no doubt due to my inexperience but I found the luck of the tile draw just a little too much. Would play again but likely this is just not my style.

Good game. This is one of Knizia's better designs.  The strategies are deep.  The game works very well for 2,3 or 4 players but requires different strategies for each number.  This is the closest Knizia has come to presenting a war game and it works well. (If Avalon Hill had written the rule book wouldn't 'internal conflict' and 'external conflict' be described as 'revolution and war?)  Only drawback ( and it is significant) is the tile draw - it is actually worse than rolling massive numbers of dice as the laws of probability suggest that the die results would balance out. Unfortunately there are so few tile draws during T&E that the game can be decided by the draw alone. This reduces the value of the game from a potentially great strategy game to a serious beer and pretzels game.

My last, and only other play of this game was in 2011, so I didn't really remember anything about it. This time I absolutely hated the experience. It feet wild, chaotic and random, although end game scoring proved that it wasn't, as each of my three opponents had nine points with me sitting at 5.

In this game, you are laying down tiles in a big grid. There are a few placement rules, but the focus is on the fact that when you put a tile down into a chain of tiles, a player who's marker is a part of that chain, with the matching color, gets a cube in that color. When two cities connect, or when a player puts a marker down in the same city as a matching opponent's marker, then players battle by spending randomly drawn tiles from behind their player screen of the color of the conflict, with the most tiles winning. In some cases you also count tiles around your marker, and in some you don't but I found the combat incredibly frustrating. My opponents might win a combat without spending any tiles behind their screen, and then I lost a combat where I had a +5 advantage to someone revealing 5 matching tiles. The winner of the combat gets some cube payout in the matching color as well.

When someone loses a combat, parts of the city flay off, which means your positions can get messed up even through no participation of your own.

I'm sad to say I hated every minute of this game. I know it's one of the big revered games out there, but I found it completely intolerable.

Knizia's masterpiece? I've been waiting forever to get my hands on the reprint of T&E, having loved pretty much all the Knizia games I've played. And I'm certainly not disappointed. The first game I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, and then I won. The second game strategies began to present themselves, and the third game I was totally hooked. It's amazing how the whole game is driven by that simple but elegant scoring mechanic, and how games can range from quick grabs for treasure to epic slug-fests. Some complain about the luck of the tile draw, but I think there are enough ways of mitigating it.

UPDATE AFTER 40 PLAYS (plus hundreds on iOS): What can I say? This is The One, my Desert Island Game, everything I'm looking for. Unlike any other Euro I know, it feels like it could have been invented thousands of years ago and rediscovered in a Mesopotamian excavation. The perfect combination of chess-like spatial strategy and poker-like bet and bluff. A match between four experienced players is my greatest gaming joy, and I'm so grateful that my group provides sufficient opportunities for me to experience that. To those who say it's all luck, I recommend playing a few times against the iOS AI on its hardest setting. Once you can win 75% of your 4-player games, let me know what you think. I will be playing this game until I die.

Started at a nine, but didn't have legs.  Not sure why I don't like this as well, but prefer many others to this one.  Still a well crafted game, but doesn't have the spark for me.  It's got more luck (or I play really badly) than I like in a game that "feels" this serious.  I like the card game version better, because it seems to have the right light feel to luck ratio.

Abstract game, played the online version of the 1st? edition. As expected from a Reiner Knizia's game, it's interesting enough, though I could see how the bookkeeping would turn me off in the board game version if there's nothing to help reduce it.

Admitedly, I have only played this game once. The plus side is that it really does have a lot of strategy to it. The down side is that there is no way i could ever explain this game to anybody and it really has nothing to do with civilization building at all. I like abstract games, but not when they choose a theme that leads you to believe that the game is something else. 

Edit: OK, revamping this rating. I like it a lot better having played it without expecting a civilization theme. Still miffed about that. It is a good abstract, but I would say that it is overrated on the geek. Especially when fantastic games like Fifth Avenue get slammed for no reason at all.

The internal/external conflicts explanation takes a bit to understand. The treasure/market, internal/temple, and king rules take a game or two to get used to. However, once you're there, the political maneuvering to set up an external conflict is marvelous (even when you're on the losing end). This is a must play and while it plays OK with two or three, really shines with four.

One good abstract tactical war game where the theme is completly irrelevent. The main problem of the game comes from the fact that it can lead to analysis paralysis slowing the game down to a point where you can loose your interest in a game. Need to try it out more to confirm my feeling.

Bon jeu de guerre tactique et abstrait ou le thème est complètement abscent. Le problème principale de ce jeux est qu'il peut mener à une paralysie analytique causant un ralentissement du jeu à un point ou vous pouvez perdre l'intéret lors d'une partie.

A surprisingly thematic entry from Dr. Knizia. Players do not control individual kingdoms, as is usually the case with games of this type, but instead control leaders that may be spread across several different kingdoms. Increasing a kingdom's size and power in one of the four realms of influence will result in a scoring cube in that color for the appropriate leader. Players must try to keep their influence spread as evenly as possible since it is the lowest of the four scores which is a player's final score. This rule in and of itself makes for the greatest dynamic in the game, since a player may find it easy to score points in one area of influence, but without any real benefit from it. Diversity is key, and this game is an amazing embodiment of that. It is also fun seeing the kingdoms grow and absorb one another after they inevitably cross borders. In this respect it feels a little like Acquire with its merger.

RATING: 4
A Gamer's game, it's appeal is far from being universal, and you'll either love it or hate it. It makes me suffer every time I play it. It's a very aggressive game (that's why my wife doesn't like it), and you have to keep a balance between your own planning and scoring and twarthing your opponent's plans as well as his own scoring.

Edit: After a while, it becomes uninteresting... You're too much at the mercy of the tiles, and there are too many variables to successfully plan or strategize efficiently... It's more tactical, and reactive... and it begins to feel a little bit boring after  a few months.

Edit: I've grown to dislike it a lot. I'm trading it or selling it.

RATING: N/A
It's taken me a long time to accept that this is a game I [i]want[/i] to like more than it's a game I actually like. 

There's a lot about it I love. It's a high-interaction game, and it has hand management (although with tiles and not cards). It takes experience to play well, the rules are just a description of the levers you can pull (how to pull them and when is completely up to you), and the game has no artificial catchup mechanism--better players will win. An extended run back when BGG hosted an electronic version of the game remains a true highlight of gaming for me. 

My major hangup--aside from the plain fact that I am terrible at the game--is that I do not retain any knowledge or strategy or insight if enough time passes between plays. It's not a Bicycle Game for me where I just pick up where I left off. It's like a language, where the longer I go without using it, the more it atrophies. Where you get together with other fluent speakers and they notice your accent, and wonder why you're unable to express a simple thought in your mother tongue, why you conjugated a verb like a preschooler. This game requires practice and repeated exposure. I can give it neither. 

So I don't see it. I see the game with no clarity, and when I do, it gets hastily scribbled on a piece of paper with disappearing ink: a week later I dig a wad of paper out of my pocket and can make out the faint lines of a once-important thought, but what was it? T&E is yet another game (like Brass) that I'd play a lot in person if I could, but it's never gotten any traction with anyone nearby, and so despite being one of my most-played games, it's fading, a vocabulary I'm slowly losing. Eventually I'll be sitting in a crowded room, everyone conversing, and I'll only be able to make out a few words here and there. "Red tiles," I'll hear over the din, otherwise lost in indistinct babble. "External conflict," from the other side of the table, floating on laughter. "My turn," I'll think to myself, smiling politely and desperately trying to guess at the missing context while everyone waits for my reply...

The theme is rather dry, like with most Knizia games. It is more or less a competitive puzzle game which I do not really like, not enough luck involved and the programmers always win. Also, I think the flow of the game is too heavy and a few less rules would have done the game good, the weight is just too heavy for that kind of game, and I would either play something more elegant or something more themed.

This is a very confrontational tile laying game.  In many ways it gives the feel of an agressive pseudo-war game (like Risk) while being completely in the "German" style with regard to rules and mechanisms.  

Knizia is often accused of pasting on theme, and though I agree in some cases (Taj Mahal) I feel the rules are very thematic in the case of T&E.

RATING: 7
Dec 2016: Raised from 7 to 10. Wow. 25% less convoluted than you current typical Euro, 400% deeper, 800% more interactive!

Dec 2007: UPDATE: Raised from 6 to 7. I finally played this game with competent players! This is the biggest problem of the game: The basic tactics of the game are not readily apparent, which must be fully understood before you can play this game quickly under an hour.

These tactics include the fact that having a temple is not necessarily a good thing, and ensuring that colours you're weak in do not break up your kingdom if someone happens to attack it -- and fully understanding the possibilities of breaking up a kingdom.

Another reason why this game is so unapproachable is its themes. There are games that the theme is well integrated with the mechanics (which is ideal). There are games in which the theme is pasted on. That's still OK to me; you can simply ignore the theme. Then there are games like T&E (and Stephenson's Rocket) that are in the middle: the theme makes sense in relation to other elements in the game, but not in relation to reality. For example, it makes thematic sense for the four types of tiles to have different purposes. But in reality: having a trader leader in a kingdom allows you to grab a treasure? Or internal conflicts in which simply being adjacent to a particular tile -- even a tile your opponent is using -- is a form of defense? This game has very complex and integrated mechanisms that do not have much connection with reality. But you can't approach it as an abstract strategy game because the rules aren't particularly elegant.

=====

I greatly admire this game but it never comes out anymore. The rules are just too fiddly. I really wanted to like this one as well. I tried this about half-a-dozen times with my dad and unfortunately the game didn't "click" with us.

RATING: 6
Yes, this is a good game, yes it deserves all the praise it gets, yes it is great abstract game with a pasted on theme. I consider this game rather an oddball in my collection.  I bought it because of the geek recommendations, because it's designed by Knizia, and because the pasted on theme seemed cool.  I was not disappointed in the game play...very clever and thought-provoking.  The theme...well, it helped me with some of the game concepts (it actually helps to view the tile aggregates as "kingdoms", and internal conflicts as "insurrections"), but at the heart of it, your fighting for little colored blocks. Still, it's pretty to look at (always a plus in my book), relatively easy to teach (the rules anyway, grasping strategy is another thing altogether), and my wife likes it!  

Edit: Had to sell it. With so many other thematic options out there, there was nothing compelling to get me to bring this abstract to table.

From one play, it seems like a very solid, strategic game. (But) I am not sure I like the way you cannot protect your strongest general/region from inside attacks.  You are too reliant on luck (drawing the red tiles) to fight off someone intent on taking your hard-earned position from you in a strong kingdom.
Definately not worthy of all the praise, adulation, and worship it receives.

I can see why this game is rated so high. You need to keep track of how each of your leaders is doing and use them to their fullest. It can be easy for one person to slip by in a 3p game. This game would definately takes a few games to really get to understand it.

RATING: 7
Although the 'theme' is VERY thin (Why bother pretending it has any theme at all, I wonder?), the game mechanics make this a great game of tactics, with thrust and counter-thrust.  I think the scoring system might be a bit too susceptible to wild swings for little reason - in the one game I've played so far, I went from dead last place by a WIDE margin to barely eking out a WIN over the other 3 players, as a result of a single mistake by one player in the middle of the game.  And he was the only one who had played it before.  Still, I had a lot of fun with it, even while I thought I was losing badly, and I'd love to play it again.

Played at Expo 2015 and was impressed straightaway (despite the rather poor teaching by the volunteer from Fantasy Flight). Reiner Knizia really is the master of creating depth out of a minimalist ruleset and I really admire that. I like the theme, the components and the decisions that this offers. It is fun to look at a new hand of tiles each turn and think "what am I going to do with this lot?". The game poses a fresh puzzle each turn, each of which can sit neatly in your longer term strategy. My rating for this could go up.

Although some reviews I saw said this was heavy, none of my gaming group had too much problem with it.  It is a deeper game than most though.  Every time I play it, there seem to be new tactics that I find. What strikes me as the best part of this game is how it really sets the theme of building a kingdom.  You can play passively or aggressively with each having to have a different strategy although it seems that conservative play is the best bet.  Really nice components except no organizer in the box. It may go to a ten with more playings.

RATING: 10
Easily one of the best games I have played.  The game is tactical and strategic with layers of depth.  There are an overwhelming number of options per turn, but can be narrowed down if a player focuses on what they need.  The comments about the lack of theme are somewhat incorrect... There is a very deep theme in the game, but it is a little unexpected.  Players must go in expecting lots of direct conflict without moving armies on the board and they will see the theme shine through!

Started playing this game online at boardgamegeek.com/tigris.  I get way more plays of this in now, as my gaming partners live over an hour away.

Definitely not instantly accessible, but once you've finished your first game and got your head around the mechanics, it clicks.

Abstract Euro with Direct conflict? Can't really describe this one but I like it. 

Not that heavy but a bit of learning Curve due to the abstract-ish and rule of each tile. Might not work with everyone.

each game is very tense and fast, the scoring mechanic is brilliant. Every game also play very difference.  

but some Luck-based draw tile from the bag may keep it from being highly competitive. will play for causal fun.

T&E seems alright to me, but I don't hold it in as high regard as most people.  Forgive me, but I find it a bit boring.  I am certainly open to playing it more, as I've only had the chance to play 4 or so times, and feel maybe I just haven't "got" the game yet.

Update : This just doesn't seem to be my type of game.  I should have researched it a bit more carefully, I suppose.  Not terrible, but there are a lot of other games I would rather play than this.

Nice strategic depth for a tile laying game. It provides several different methods of scoring points, with no one standing as completely superior to the other. (pressing your advantages is key)

That said, the rules feel unintuitive and clunky. For that reason, I don't enjoy it as much as Samurai the card game. Additionally, some players are turned off by the random tile draws which, admittedly, can throw off your game completely.

Players 2-4, best with 4.  Weight 3.53.
Only played once-- a little hard to learn; may get a higher rating with more plays... 
Tile placement, area development, and conflict in an abstract war game. Balance matters -- only your lowest set is scored, and there are two types of conflict (internal from the placement of two same-colored leaders in a single region, and external from the merging of two regions). All of this means there is a lot to keep track of, and many ways to win or lose the game. Building monuments early can lead to a steady stream of points. Players who do not protect their positions will find all their hard work is stolen by a swift maneuver from an opponent.

RATING: 4.5
I didn't know what to expect when starting this game.  As the rules were explained to me I began to realize this was not going to be a game I would enjoy.  I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, but still not great.

I don't like games where other players can mess with my plans.  This game is designed to have conflict.

I also don't particularly care for abstract games.  This game is very abstract in the way tiles and leaders are placed.  You want optimize your limited actions and things can get a bit thinky.  Sometimes it's fairly easy to see your optimum choice, but sometimes analysis paralysis sets in.  I try to stay away from games that promote AP.

I did like the scoring mechanism.  You must balance the points from every color as the lowest of the group is your final score.  In our play the scores were 11, 10, 9.  Very tight!

This game is one where people will really gang up on the "leader".  If you make a brilliant move then the next few rounds are going to be horrible as everyone tears apart what you were able to build.  I prefer games that reward you for playing cleverly, not ones that allow the other players to quickly gang up on you.

I don't like the hidden information for scoring.  You can only speculate as to which color an opponent is needing to increase their final score.  If this information was public knowledge then the decisions for making a turn would be much faster.  "Oh, they need more red.  I'll just block red."

My opinion on my second play went down a bit. I think perhaps there are too many options here. Do not play with AP prone players.

I think the reason I don’t want to play this is, while I appreciate that it’s a well-designed game, there can be a wide disparity in the skill level in the players. This game is especially frustrating when you’re not doing well and have to sit there and watch other players score points while you wait for the end of the game.

Played again to confirm that I actually disliked the game. I think my poor opinion of the game is justified. I completely agree with what I said a couple years back about this game.

I really enjoy this game.  It's marketed as "watching kingdoms rise and fall", but it's basically an abstract tile laying game mechanic.  There are so many strategies and different ways to play each turn that some folks may be overwhelmed, but I rather like it that way!  It can be played 2 players (I own the Mayfair version, which lists it as 3-4 players), but with 2 there tends to be much less conflict.  Rules are simple and short, if a bit on the vague side.  I recommend reading through the GameGeek comments and reviews, as this helped me understand some of the rules more than I would have just reading them.

I would rate this a 9 or even a 10 but it has a real problem with the learning curve. There is something conceptually different about each of the different rules that is used for resolving conflicts/victory points which makes it counter-intuitive. The result is that it takes several sessions to actually get a grasp on what is happening - and that just seems more than it should be for a game of this type.

I find it absolutely fascinating that this game can play well with more than 2 players. It may be that I'm perceiving this as an abstract game (and this is not a knock - I love abstracts). I also love the way the game winning conditions force us to be a generalist instead of a specialist. This runs counter to the way many other games are designed. So. A lot to like - just not my cup of tea. 

UPDATE (2015-07-15): Wow. Out of boredom I fired up T&E on my iPhone to play - and totally loved the game. It's still a bit dry but I find it engaging now.  What I like about this is the need to evaluate when to shift my priorities to generating cubes for my weaker leaders.  My games also have more of a 'give and take' quality. I might lose a leader in an area, but if that leader has 2x the cubes of another leader, I might not even bother bringing it back into play, and focus on boosting the weaker leaders.  I also find it a challenge to decide when to force the game end (by aggressively swapping tiles) - that alone has helped keep my interest up, and I wonder if I didn't like it earlier because they ran longer than I had patience for. I want to start playing this more against other human players to see what the experience is like.

(10/17/07) - Just got this today. I have heard great things about it, but I worry about the complexity level.

(12/27/07) - [7] - Played my first 3-player game of this tonight. Not nearly as complicated as I was lead to believe. Abstract, yes...but entirely manageable to play after browsing the rules. Lots of fun, though I will dock it a point for the pasted-on theme.

(7/1/08) - [8] - 4 more plays with an electronic version have allowed me to ignore the bookkeeping aspect and instead focus on strategy. I now understand how the game works much better and see that there is a lot more strategy than meets the eye. I still have to dock 1 point for the pasted-on theme.

(5/1/13) - Tigris & Euphrates has been sold as part of a larger liquidation of my collection. It was a fun game that simply wasn't ever played enough.

A Euro heavy with direct conflict.

My most important epiphany regarding the strategy of this game: a player doesn't "own" anything on the board. He's simply a leech, drawing strength from whatever organisms he can. When he's removed, he can simply affix himself to some other warm body.

This was an impressive mechanism to someone whose most complex game played was Settlers of Catan.

Recently increased this after more plays.  Plays great as either a 2 - 4 player game. Takes quite a few plays to understand and develop workable strategies.

Highly recommended for those willing to invest.

Four things:  First, this is a game that rewards creativity.  There are SO many ways of getting what you want in the game, and very often you have to look carefully to figure out the right way to do it.  The tactics are incredibly delicious.  There's about 5 ways to make points, and every move you mave involves consideration of all 5 of those methods.  

Second, this is a dramatic game.  Beginners tend to play in a non-dramatic fashion, slowly building up 'their' kingdoms, but once you get the hang of the game, the best play is usually quite aggressive, and you are constantly destroying armies of others, usurping power, gaining possession of treasures and monuments.  it's not an incremental type game of, "let's try to balance my budget."  No!  It's a dramatic game about the rise and fall of civilizations, playable in about an hour!

Third:  it's beautiful to see kingdoms start, florish, grow, decay, and rebuild.  At the end of the game, you have before you a territory with a rich and complex history, and you can marvel at how a particular piece of land had been once part of a glorious society that had sadly been sacked by a vicious intruder, but now was slowly getting back on its feet under new leadership.  The feeling is analogous to the feeling after playing carcassonne, where you can admire the map that you had collectively built.

Fourth: It should be noted that this is a wargame, full of conflict.  If conflict is not your thing, this probably isn't a game for you.  That being said, Tigris and Euphrates is a "german" wargame, meaning that it the following nice attributes: 

No one is ever eliminated from the game.
There's tension right up to the very end (hidden scoring makes it difficult to determine if someone is blowing out everyone else).
Decisions are more difficult than your average grognard-style wargame.
The game is short (60-90 mins)!
Rules are (comparatively) simple

So there you have it.  Rise and fall of civilizations in an hour, lots of creative, difficult decisions, very very dramatic.

RATING: 9
Tigris and Euphrates feels like a game heralding an ancestry as ancient as its thematic premise. Here we find a clear rise and fall of kingdoms, where religion is the source of internal conflict, where your kingdom's followers are the crux of your military might, and where you, in tandem with others, are constantly striving to develop the pillars of civilization: religion, government, agriculture, and trade. In the vein of classic Knizia design, your civilization is only as strong as your weakest link. 

This game's various aspects quintuple-check *almost* all the boxes that characterize my ideal board game. It just lacks the 'pizzazz' I like to have, that feeling of a carefully crafted clever move that forces another player to act in a way that is unavoidably detrimental to them. I can be antagonistic in that way, but it is my preferred way to play. Beyond playing with two (which plays very differently, mind you), the game becomes a bit too wild and chaotic to effectively set up any one individual. That is not to say three and four player counts are not an engaging experience. Oh, they most certainly are.

The game seems to revolve more around subterfuge and big swing turns rather than posturing for a grand interlocking strategy. Paradoxically, it feels as though you need to have a semblance of both in mind to win. You hope that you can be left to your devices (unlikely) and simultaneously pray that your offensive efforts are not stymied. Tensions are often heavy as the game constantly challenges you to find an effective balance between strategy and tactics.

T&E is a triumph in design and easily a timeless staple. Bravo, Dr. Knizia.

(+) Simple mechanisms, dynamic and open-ended space with high depth.
(+) Player-driven gameplay, high interaction and conflict.
(+) Mind-bendingly thematic despite being, in skeleton alone, an abstract game. Never a sought out criterion, personally, but Knizia somehow pulls it off. 

(-) A bit of clunker to teach, and the complexity lies in the maneuvers available to you and the reminder to new players to track all sources of point earnings. A minor hassle, at worst.
(-) Not particularly great with two players, which is something that most abstracts achieve.
(-) A poor run of luck spanning multiple turns can cripple you, though not excessively so, and it can be somewhat mitigated.

I love this game, although I haven't gotten it to the table much lately.  For a while I was skipping meals, work and sleep to find time for one more game of T&E.  Definitely a top 5 game for me and can't imagine that changing.  Ironically I really haven't enjoyed other Reiner games that much that I've played.

Edit 11/07: This is basically all I play right now, via PBEM on BGG.  I think it is starting to wear a bit thin, but still fantastic.  I just need some variety.  All the elements to balance are just fantastic.  I love the ebb and flow between games as strategies unbalance and rebalance with new ideas and techniques.

(Comment from 11-6-2006)

Neat game, and my favorite of the Knizia tile-layers, but I don't particularly love the Knizia tile-layers the way other people do. They all seem like different versions of go that have been castrated in different ways. I appreciate the game, I appreciate the variety of strategy, but they don't call to me like Knizia's auction games or some of his nuttier stuff like Taj Mahal.

I was bigger on this game in the past, but lately I keep putting this game up to, I don't know, Acquire in my head, and finding this one just a little... less beautiful.

The only difficult part about this game is the rules - it took me about 4 plays (between online using BGG and physical play) to figure out all the subtle rules.  Definitely a gamer's game.  The luck-of-the-draw on tile pieces can kill you, but if you're clever you can overcome that fault.  Be careful when using disaster cards, as once you've used them, they're gone for good!

Critics who say that the game is very random are wrong.  Fans who say that it is very low on randomness are wrong.  The game can be a bit random, but it is still an excellent game with a lot of interesting strategy.  Don't be afraid to redraw your hand of tiles.  You don't need a lot of red tiles to win. Drawing a lot of blue tiles can be death.

I really enjoy how the mechanics fit together and even the special case rules seem natural.  The scoring is interesting and causes an engaging endgame as everyone is trying to sure up their lowest color.

Rules are not as complex as some make them out to be, but I watched some excellent videos first so take that as you will.

If I had to quibble I would say that the random tile draw occasionally bites.

 To me it's a 9 for the standard game. A lot of direct interaction, nice scoring system that keeps the game interesting till the end, plenty of space for strategic planning and perhaps a little bit too much luck for the tile drawing mechanics. The board landscape changes fast when resolving external conflicts, leading to a nice thematic effect of fallen and reborn civilizations. Probably most thematic Knizia's game alongside Modern Art.

 But a 7 for the advanced version. The game becomes very static because there are too many ways to score points without clashing with other players, specially in the three players version, as external conflicts lose significance.

I'm in love with the mechanics of the game and just how fluidly it plays. I really like how quickly the game can change, yet, the changes don't feel random or impossible to plan for. There are both long-term strategies and short-term ones, and that's another refreshing aspect of the game. I also like how a player can just keep giving "useless" victory points to someone else in order to accomplish other goals. 

I'll probably revisit my rating once I've played it a few more times; my expectation is that the rating will go up.

Wow, this game just keeps getting better and better.  I have never played it face to face -- only slow games here on the geek.  I'm definitely going to be getting this one soon, though.

I think I prefer open scoring, at least when playing online.  I might think differently in a FtF game.

The deepest "gamers game" that I enjoy playing.  A sense of civilization and empire building, though more abstract than I would like.

I like the fact that the game accommodates playing styles; you can be very aggressive and interactive, or you can be very non-aggressive and try to avoid conflict.  Both approaches can result in victory.

The key for beginners is to figure out the difficult difference between an "internal conflict" and an "external conflict" -- once you understand that, then the game has been unlocked.

It took me a very long time before I actually liked Tigris and Euphrates.  Don't try learning this game on your own or against an AI.  The conflicts didn't make much sense and the play just seemed really boring and dull.

RATING: 3
A clear case where I think the pasted-on theme makes it harder to teach and learn.  I generally don't like the screening of victory points - it's not too hard to keep track of how many of each color your opponent(s) have collected if you want to, especially with just 2p, but that then takes a lot of the fun out of the game if you're trying that hard.  I do see that this game could bog down with a lot of AP for some if victory points were visible. Lastly, using cubes for victory points just feels weird, compared to how they are used in every other Euro I've played. I think I would always recommend Ingenious (no attempt at pasted-on theme, simplified but similar feel, less conflict) over T&E.

----------

I dislike T&E's scripted openings, but beyond the first few moves, the game develops differently each time.  I can see the rise and fall of civilizations as the board matures, so it's not a dry, theme-less experience for me.  I like that the random tile draw keeps things fresh and that it limits your strategic capability.  I do recognize the power of red tiles in the late game, but I think that unknown of each new round breathes life into the game.  Incredible tension with several options on each turn.  I don't really like playing the game on BGG because the competition of the league spoils the fun of the game for me. 

I find my desire to play this game slowly dwindling, but it's a fantastic game nonetheless.

A very interesting game. A communal board area which looks fascinating and acts as a giant puzzle. The victory point system is unique and encourages varietal gameplay (can't just do one thing all game and win like with many strategy war games). Feels like playing chess but with a fun twist. Have yet to play with more than 2 players but I would expect the the game to only get better.

Edit: I have since played with multiple players, both 3 and 4 player counts. The game changes dramatically with that many people on the board as the timer (bag) goes by quicker so you will have overall less moves and the landscape can change massively between one turn to the next. While I enjoy the game greatly, its definitely one I have to be in the mood for as this type of thinking can take a lot of energy and the simplicity of the mechanics, while great for strategy, can come off as dry compared to some other games out there nowdays.

--20Sept2004-- Based on a few live plays (and a lot of thrashing against the http://sourceforge.com/projects/tigrisgame AI.)  While the game is amusing enough, I'm still not seeing the brilliance here:  and while the fault is likely with me, there are loads of things I'd prefer to play.

I LOVE this game. A new favorite, I've only had it for a few months (since Oct '09 or so). It seems so simple, and yet there is more to it than meets the eye. You can easily neglect a color, or a person, and end up getting completely owned.

RATING: 4
This game requires more patience and study than I am willing to give it at this point. Stands out as the rare Knizia game that I am not a big fan of.
UPDATE: Gave it another chance, and that will do it. Add this to the list of games that I have a real respect for the design of, but that just don't work for me personally. I don't like the meanness of the game, and I don't care for games where the decision space (the things you need to consider on each turn) is so large.

A brilliant semi-abstract strategy game.  It's a constant battle for position with nonstop trading of blows and re-evaluation of the board.  Only rates an 8 because there's a little too much tile-drawin' luck for my tastes -- good strategy can still fall short if you get screwed out of red tiles.

Knizia's masterpiece. There is luck for getting the tiles, but skillful player turns the bad luck around. Not as abstract as you might first think, you can feel how kingdoms rise and fall.

The game practically always needs 4 players and it doesn't look very attractive. That makes hard to get the game played with new players.

I would have liked to like this game a lot more than I do. (I spent some 50€ on it, it has a brilliant theme, it's rather good-looking) but still I think it lacks something. I've only played it five times or so, and four of them were two player games. Maybe I just have to play it more to notice its brilliance. Maybe my ways of thinking don't suit this game. Maybe (or even it is likely that) I have wrong people to play this with...

RATING: 7
A well-balanced game, that appears abstract at first, but really does evoke a theme well. Plenty of player interaction; no multi-player solitaire here! Reminds me of Go sometimes.

My big complaint is: stop trying to make private variables (score) that you declare publicly and then increment publicly! This really drives me nuts, both from a logical perspective, and from the fact that it means that optimally each player would continuously take notes with pen & paper. Either you're doing that (which is obviously stupid), or you're not playing properly, which bugs me.

RATING: 10
This has quickly become my number one favourite game. Amazing. Plays well with 2,3 or 4.

A variant 2p rules suggested by BGG user: Michael Kandrac (Gamegrunt)

For a tight, shorter two-player T&E try this...
- Remove the four corner Temples
- Remove 14 Red Tiles
- Remove 9 Blue Tiles
- Remove 8 Green Tiles
- Remove 8 Black Tiles
Play game normally except game ends when 1 temple treasure remains.

I hated my first game of this. It can be very difficult to learn, and it is indeed very abstract. However, after I got past the learning curve, I saw a game with a lot of tactical depth, and a very unique Euro-game.

Very Accessible Complex Euro 

An early acquisition of mine...I didn't understand it. I mean, I understood the rules (they were pretty easy & accessible), but the strategies remained opaque to me, even after 3 or 4 plays, so I sold it. I was heavily into Go at the time, so I figured that if I didn't get it, there wasn't much there--how could an abstract game remain opaque to me after I had cracked open the mysteries to the Master Abstract?

Played again many years later, and saw glimmers of what I had been missing. Was intrigued enough to re-purchase, and at this point I feel confident in saying that this is a very good game. Took me a while to get there, though.

The FF version is the best, guys. Don't stand on euro v. Ameritrash prejudices, just get it. I love wood pieces as much as the next guy, but this version just feels more right, somehow. I think by saying this I'm classifying the game more as a euro than an abstract. THe Mayfair bits signaled that it was an abstract. It's not. It's a euro that does better with more euro-ish bits.

Je me rends compte que j'avais oublié de laisser un avis sur Tigre & Euphrate. Pas grand chose à ajouter à la cascade d'avis positifs sur ce jeu. Des règles d'une simplicité exemplaire (même si la notion de conflit interne/externe semble inexplicablement difficile à faire comprendre à des débutants) pour un jeu à la fois thématique, riche et avec juste ce qu'il faut de hasard pour rendre les parties accessibles et passionnantes, sans compter les conditions de victoire, favorisant un jeu équilibré et donc subtil.

Plus qu'un jeu, une œuvre d'art ludique, comme il y en a encore bien peu et que seul un grand nom comme Reiner Knizia pouvait s'en rendre l'auteur.

Too dry for me, but i still enjoyed it because it is so easy to teach to non-gamers, while quite deep and requires careful thinking. It lasted until one game in which I drew a gazzilion of red tiles and won easily despite being jointly attacked by all other players. It spoiled the game for me.

Just a tad chaotic for me. I must confess that I don't really get why this game is rated so highly. I have played it some more to try and understand it, but it just seems to me that with players of roughly equal skill the winner is the one who's lucky enough to draw the most red tiles and stays out of conflict the most. To initiate conflict and lose is disasterous both in terms of the initial waste of tiles and your turn, but also because of how it (depending on your new tile draw), opens you up for attack. Hence the luck of the tile draw seems overwhelming to me. Others say they see a theme and I'm happy for them. I'd rather play something else.

After a bad first impression playing the game online against the bot, I could try it recently live and my thoughs changed drastically.  This is, without a doubt, one of the best Knizia designs, together with [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21882]Blue Moon City[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/503]Through the Desert[/url][/i].  Nevertheless it could be label as an abstract game, the theme is convincing and adds an unique flavor.  At the end, you feel surprised cause, after all, you really felt being in Mesopotamia struggling for power.  My rating could be even higher, but the luck involved in the resolution of conflicts is very high for a game of this weight.

It's all about taking those scoring opportunities when they arise, isn't it?  It's the anti-civ building game in some ways.  While its great to build a colossal kingdom, it's hard if not impossible to maintain.  I see it almost like a game of sniping points here and there.  Maybe that's why I'm so terrible at it.  Very tactic heavy and very dynamic, so your strategy must remain flexible.  Gives rise to interesting philosophical discussions when the question of whether the game is abstract or well-themed is raised.

Wonderfully complex strategy game with a seemingly infinite amount of strategies to play on any given turn. Brilliant in the sense that your WEAKEST category determines the winner. The constant conflicts in this game keep the game lively & keeps all the players on their toes -- while you're trying to plan ahead for the future, you realize that ANYTHING can happen at any given time. Took us about 90 minutes to comprehend the instructions the first time we read them, and our first game was 4 hours long. So the game is on the longer side, but it is WELL WORTH the investment. I am addicted. This game reminds me a lot of chess, but whereas chess bores me, this game excites me. This is a great game... one of my favorite board games I have ever played.

I've only played this game twice. I'm not entirely sure what I think about it yet, but I'm leaning towards positive. It's a bit dry and I don't really have a grasp on how to play the game well, but I suppose the important thing is that, unlike some games, I [i]am[/i] interested in playing again to see if I [i]can[/i] learn how to play well; I like how the scoring system works to force players away from specialization, and I think the theme works very well as a mnemonic if not as aid to immersion. I also like how the landscape of the game can change radically after a conflict has been resolved, creating the potential for swings in momentum or control between the players. In this sense, the game has some of the feel I associate with Reef Encounter, as dominant species of coral spread out and consume their weaker neighbours. Between the two games, I prefer Reef Encounter, primarily because I find the theme more interesting and its application more transparent. Given the choice, I would more often opt to play Reef Encounter, so I sometimes wonder if I need to own this game. For now, I think it's different enough that I want to give it a chance to grow on me some more.

The game is definately abstract with a thin veneer of a theme, but it did not seem as dry and mechanical as most abstract games. In fact, to me, El Grande feels more abstract than this. 
I can see the expanding/contracting tile groupings as kingdoms wracked by civil war and invasion. New leaders emerge and fight for power. The "luck" of the tile draw for me is an integral part of the game. It simulates both fog of war and limited resources very elegantly. A really great game.

I really enjoy this game, and it's well deserving of all it's praise. For everyone out there looking for the "Civ Lite" game, this is as good as you're going to get!

Edit 12/30/06: I really don't play this much anymore, so I've downgraded my rating. It's still good, but if it's not seeing play over other stuff, I can't justify the 9 rating I used to give it.

Knizia's magnus opus stands alone: there's no other game like this. You're trying to score the 4 colors in a balanced manner, but the mechanisms set you up such that it is easy to specialize only in one or two, and the route to strengthening your kingdom is often not the route to balanced scoring.

I am a bit leery that heretofore, most games (including on Tigris) have been decided by having the right colors at the right time to win swing-y external conflicts in the somewhat unsatisfying combat system. But there are many options to consider on your turn to outweigh this slightly more luck-dependent component, and this brings up some fine opportunities to bluff/deduce.

Interesting solid mechanics, but THE THEME IS A LIE. I really enjoy Mesopotamian history, but the theme was a hindrance to the game play. It would be much better as a cloak and daggers type game. After all, for a third party to place a random tile to connect two other disconnected kingdoms to have the effect of starting a war in which that third party is not involved in any way is nonsensical in a Mesopotamian context but is understandable if the theme were to be one of espionage and terrorism. The poor choice of theme spoiled it for me. For a superb marriage of theme choice and mechanics, just look at "Chaos in the Old World."

Great game but definatly has some issues (otherwise I'd give it a 9+ rating).

Small mistakes can result in huge changes in the board.  Often random luck determines what you can do.  Generally that means you have to try to maximize whatever options you have, but often the best you can do with yours is way inferior to your opponents options.

Tigris & Euphrates -- I've only played this twice.  I did quite well both times, but found it almost unbearably nerve-wracking.  I'd like to play it more.

RATING: 8.5
I ... like it. 

I like how it reminds of old timey abstracts, yet isn't. (and in Pegasus edition it also looks very nice). It's strategic, interactive, yet has a lot of luck involved and reminds of traditional card games in this regard. And the results are never quite predictable, though you think they should be (like in good cardgames).

Surprisingly to Knizia there's a definite narrative arch to the game - kingdoms rise, fall and empty monuments remain. I don't think there is a minus to the game, maybe it's needing repeated plays and probably not nongamer friendly. But if you have a space for that kind of game in your collection (and want to impress people who love or respect traditional abstracts) this is the game.

hmm!  number 2 game at bgg (#1 when i bought it) and i give it a 5 (meaning that it's ... ok).

i find that the luck element of the tile draw has thrown off my strategy too often for me to ever like this game.  i find myself competing with the tile bag rather than my opponents.

generally, when somebody suggests this one, i try to talk them into something fu ...

it's kind of sad too because there's so much interesting stuff here.  the scoring system is really interesting and the competition for territory works really well.  maybe if there was a variant that fixed the tile draw, i would be willing to try it again.

RATING: 9
Brilliant game, actually much closer to Go in terms of skills than Through the Desert, but very different, of course. The object is not to surround or capture, but to protect and expand four different pieces at once against multiple types of attacks, and to figure out a way to expand quicker than other players.

A mind-reeling joy.

I have a feeling that my rating for it would go up if I played it more with experienced players.

Like Agricola I can respect Tigris more than I enjoy it. If I'm honest with myself that's at least in part because I'm appallingly bad at it, but I do feel it's more of an abstract puzzle that bites back than a 'fun game' experience. +++ updated after a couple more recent plays  +++ OK I think it's a very good game actually.

RATING: 10
[18 plays, many as a 2 player.] The time zips right by when you are playing this game. The last time I've been so addicted to the rush of playing an abstract game was 30 years ago when I couldn't get enough chess. 

The contest seems largely tactical as strategies can evaporate on contact with reality. But the tactics are complex and intriguing. In a 4 player game, it becomes almost purely tactical, as players just have to do their best to keep up with the rapidly evolving landscape.

Very interesting game; as a newbie, it's a bit hard to tell what you should be doing, since scores are private. Tactics are richer than the other Knizia games I've played, and there is a lot of strategy I don't understand at all. I need to play this more. 

Update: 10 or so plays in, I still don't understand it at all. It's also a bit dry for how heavy it is.

I will write the truth: I don't understand this game. I need someone to teach it to me... not the rules, but the way to win. I don't enjoy it so far. I'm not sure I will enjoy it even if I understand it better though, most probably it's not my cup of tea.

UPDATE> I think I might have begun to "get it" since I am regularly winning my iPod. It's a good design but I find it boring for some reason- I'd play anything else at any given time. So I am selling the actual game and I'll only keep the iPod version, it's more than enough for this.

RATING: 10
The ancient civilizations theme is so thin that I tend to forget about it while I'm playing. Nevertheless, this is an excellent game that rewards planning, calculation, and flexibility. And it hasn't gotten stale even after repeated play. So simple and yet so deep. I have no doubt that E&T deserves it's high ranking.

Update 10 years later... This game has been sitting on the shelf for a while, but I recently returned to discover how much fun it continues to be. Should I be surprised that T&E has sunk from #1 to #61 in the rankings? Like chess, it's relatively dry, cerebral, and conflict oriented. With today's geeks all about theme and bling, Tigris doesn't fit the BGG zeitgeist as well as it used to. Nevertheless, it will always have a home in my game collection. I have the old Mayfair edition-- I can't stand the Fantasy Flight Games treatment for this game.

RATING: 7
An innovative game design. Even when you seem strong you are always vulnerable to attacks from other players. Many times a bitter defeat opens a new opportunity. It is possible to make quite nasty moves. If there are people who tend to have a little bit of a temper while playing, I wouldn't neccesary recomend it for them. Works good with three, but better with four players.

I still feel like I have a lot to learn with this one, but it is a fantastic mind-expanding game.  Plus my wife loves it too!  So simple and yet so deep, you can play it many times over and see new things unfold in different games.  There is something in the lucky tile draw factor, but manipulating your hand to clear out a bunch of blue clogging up your hand for example is part of the game and a good player will do well whatever his tile draw (notice I did not say the best will always win though).

I've tried to like this title and don't. Something about this game I just don't 'get' and (unlike other games I just don't 'get' - I'm looking at you: In the Year of the Dragon :P) I don't find myself strangely still wanting to play it.

Totally flat on this one, but my husband, and many other people I know, love it, so I think this one is just me. To me, the game feels like purely 'tile pulling' with no inherent depth, or strategy, or tension. Again, I accept I am alone in this,so I don't think I can fairly rate this game.

RATING: 7
Of all the "heavy-weight" European games I have played, this is my favorite. Excellent with 2, 3, or 4, there are many different strategies to pursue. I love the fact that a player can come from behind to win - with the right strategy. The scoring mechanism is also ingenious, and keeps the game tense to the end. It's just excellent when everyone thinks player X is going to win, and then, when the victory cubes are revealed, little ol' player Y wins! The game has nice components and great player interaction, but seem a little mean-hearted and suffers from weak thematic elements. I DO like the theme here, but if I had to rate theme as a separate component, it would get a 7, whereas the rest of the game would get a 10. The confrontations can also get a little too nasty (for some players). That's code for: my wife will never suggest this game (although she will play it). Despite these gripes, I must rate this an 8 - it is incredible. I will also add that only this game (and Knizia's Durch Die Wuste) have actually gotten my wife mad during a game. I haven't decided yet if that is a mark for or against them. :)

My first eurogame and still the best experience with the genre. It's tense, dynamic and everybody is engrossed till the end. The mechanics are geniously innovative and constitutes a highly aesthetic element in their own right, adding to an already beautiful looking game. 4 players is a must though, luck does play a role and new players always seem to win for some strange reason.   

After many, many plays: the game actually works great with 3 players too, if you don't camp too much (which is a beginners strategy). The game still amazes me.

1997-es játék, de a játékmenete zseniális. Talán az egyik legizgalmasabb, legjobb játékmenet, amivel találkoztam. Annyira elvarázsolt ez, illetve a szép második Myfair kiadás táblája és lapkái, hogy kevésbé zavart a játék két hibája. Az egyik, a szerencse szerepe egy ilyen komoly játék esetében abszolút felhozható probléma, de én aki a kis szerencsét bőven elviselem emiatt morgolódtam a legkevésbé. A királycsinálás nagymértékű megjelenése viszont kevésbé jó dolog. Sajnos kevésbé hozzáértő játékos simán csinálhat olyan lépést, amivel megnyeretheti egy másik játékostársával a partit. Illetve a játék sokat gondolkodós játékosok mellett nagyon elhúzódhat. De az igazság az, hogy ebben a játékban muszáj sokat gondolkodni egy-egy lépésen.
A játékosok négy színben próbálnak kockákat gyűjteni, lapkalerakásokkal és vezérekkel, akinek a játék végén a négy fajtából a legkevesebb darabszámúból a legtöbb van az a nyertes. Ez a pontozás a Genialból lehet ismerős és nagyon fekszik ebben a játékban is. A játék sava-borsát a kétfajta konfliktus adja. A belsőben piros kockáért és vezérelzavarásért megy a harc, a külsőben viszont jó sok kocka begyűjtésért is.
Nagyon jó játék a Tigris, azonos szintű játékosokkal az egyik legjobb játékélmény lehet a társasok világában. Akik nem félnek egy-egy hosszabb gondolkodású körtől mindenképpen próbálják ki.

[2011-05-14]
Továbbra is zseniális játéknak tartom a második parti után, de a királycsináló effektus miatt egyszerűen nem tudok neki magasabb pontszámot adni.

I would prefer the random tile draw be replaced somehow, but I can't think of how you could keep it simple and elegant.

Way too dependant on tile draws and equal player experience.  I have yet to have fun playing this, and that is why I play games.  Update: I have tried to give this game chance after chance.  God! This game is boring! Dropped down to a 3 from a 4.

Brilliant game. I'm still learning new things about this game after playing it dozens of times (most games are thru iOS and BGG, which I haven't been recording until recently). The strategies unfold themselves over time. The game gets better and better the more times I play. 

I just wish it was easier to convince my friends to play this f2f.

Falling somewhere between a pure-abstract game and a Martin Wallace-style tactical economy-builder, Tigris and Euphrates is just about perfect. Beginners always have trouble distinguishing the internal and external conflicts, but a few examples usually clear this up. T&E can be very boring if everyone tries to be too nice, and it can be extremely frustrating if everyone is too aggressive. Once the group finds a workable balance, though, it just works.

I love this game so much I would never part with it, even considering how little I play it due to some people in my group disliking it greatly.

The big plus is that it makes for an excellent 2P game so you just need to find another person that likes it. Yay!

I cannot explain why I like this game so much because 1. I play it rarely 2. I'm really bad at it but there's something in this game that is just pure abstract strategy goodness, again I can't explain it.

Oh and good luck finding a woman that likes this game :P.

It was apparent from my first play that this is an outstanding game.  There is a truckload of conflict in this struggle for dominance.  There is a significant random element in the draws, but you have to learn to play what you get well.  It plays well at 2, best (I imagine) at 3, and I hate it at 4.  The 2p game gives you a chance to really understand what does what, as you can string together moves to achieve a strategy.  This is largely absent in the 4p game, as the board can change so much between turns.

Fun, but I stink at it. And it's a little difficult explaining the rules.

When playing with new players, expect newbie choices to throw the game in somebody's direction.

But I think it's a great game, the best tile-placement game I've played. A lot of interesting choices, and it's tense trying to guess what tiles other player's have in-hand.

RATING: 9.5
Four types of leader, two types of conflict, never enough blue tiles, and eighty-three kinds of pain.  I've never won a game where I didn't force at least one conflict that scared me.  (Of course, that's lost me a lot of games, too.)  Unlike many games with only one path to victory, the winning strategy in T&E changes every game (or every turn) according to your opponents' actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Given my experience in playing this game, I think I've overrated it, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt on its potential.  We had very little conflict in the game I did play, and the experienced player totally destroyed us (not in a malicious way; he did his best to explain what we needed to do).  I'd like to play it again and see if I have more fun with it.

UPDATE: Dropping this to a 6 to reflect my true feelings about this.  If this gets on the table again, may change the rating again.

UPDATE #2: Played this again.  I finally understood how the conflicts and monuments worked and we had a game with interesting ebb-and-flow.  There's a lot to this game, and I look forward to playing it again.  I think it's different enough that I recommend at least a couple of plays before deciding that it's not one's cup of tea.

UPDATE #3: After my third play, I now fully follow how the game is supposed to be played, and I have a bit of an idea for strategy.  There's plenty of depth to this game, and I look forward to my next play.

Also a note that the second edition is well worth it: the white background of the first edition really is quite lousy.

It is amazing that I enjoy this game so much because I am flat out terrible at it.  Just terrible!  

This is the one game, and maybe Brass too, where I feel that I am in a battle with the other players.  There is a lot of freedom of play here that I enjoy and every game is very different.  It is amazing how much game there is for a relatively simple set of rules.  You must be adaptable, relentless, and clever to do well.  And take chances.  And hide your intentions.  And and and... this game has it all.  I'm hooked!!!

After studying the rules and thinking about them forever, finally I taught T&E to three gamers who also wanted to play. I quickly crushed one of them, stealing his kingdom and its monument, installing all of my leaders in choice positions within it. After establishing a sprawling, well fortified kingdom, I set my sights on others. A large war with who I perceived to be winning left me with even more territory and another monument. I ended up winning, left with an empire as secure as anyone could expect. Everyone walked away satisfied. I've lost games since, but I've always walked away wanting to play again.

Critics charge that T&E lacks theme. That's nonsense. There are revolutions, wars, and better civilization building than in any board game I've played. There are dramatic moves, decisive swings, and Machiavellian strategies. After a mistake, you'll see where you went wrong and you'll think about how best to improve for next time. When you triumph, you'll feel that you earned it. Like Twilight Struggle and Cosmic Encounter, T&E tells a story. Each player has one, their own arc, telling the tale of their own clan, but they're part of a larger story too, united by a shared board.

This is a classic, and also my first eurogame ever (bought it even before I bought Settlers). We played it a lot when it was the only game I had (it isn't logged as I didn't know of BGG back then). I think that the only reason it isn't played anymore is the terrible production quality of the Russian version. Paper VPs are awful. After a similar experience with Samurai I'm sure I won't buy localized games in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I tried this many times, some face to face and a lot here on BGG. It's OK, but I don't share the love for this game that so many others seem to have. It seems largely tactical, which I generally prefer - plays are almost completely dictated by your hand of tiles and the current board layout (makes it great for PBW with open cubes). But there is certainly more here than just tactics: spatial play on the board (one reason why this is better than the E&T Card Game), bluffing, timing the end of the game, etc. But after years of having the game sit on the shelf unplayed, we finally traded it off. After all, I can always play it on BGG, and buy a newer copy (with extra map) if I somehow fall in love with the game!

I've tried really hard to like this game and I don't understand exactly why I don't.  Maybe I'm trying too hard!  It's clearly well-designed, to say the least, and surely deserving of the heaps of praise showered upon it.  For some reason, it doesn't hold my interest.  
Abstract games and placing tiles aren't my favorite, yet I can think of examples of both types of games that I enjoy, such as Through The Desert.  Maybe one day I'll have a brainstorm and understand my aversion to this game.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I'm not usually a fan of tile-placement or overly abstract games but even though this is heavily in both of those camps I absolutely love everything about Tigris and Euphrates.  The design is just so amazingly elegant.  The interaction of the different leaders, different types of conflicts, need to collect points across all colors evenly because you are scored on the lowest, and so much more offers such a breadth of strategy that this is one of the most thinking games I've ever played and I absolutely love every second of it.

The one sorta criticism I have is that despite the simplicity of this game it is difficult to teach to others.  Certain concepts like that you can put your leader in another kingdom and that a kingdom is never really "your kingdom" are difficult to grasp for new players, it's not the average gaming mindset.  And even when you have a firm grasp on all the rules it is a game that is difficult to master, although that's an attribute of a lot of overly abstract games.

I like the game a lot. I really don't know if it's Knizia's best but I love the game. The mechanics is excelent. Very competitive and very heavy. Maybe it's too heavy. The only thing I don't like that much it's the art and the tile's taking. It really makes the game too much "lucky pick".
Edit: It grows on you.

PORTUGUÊS: O jogo é muito bom. Para mim tem o defeito de ser demasiado pesado. Ou seja, mentalmente é muito exigente. Sempre. Também não gosto muito de ter demasiado trabalho a jogar um jogo que depois, ao fim e ao resto, depende demasiado da sorte em relação às cores das peças que vamos tirando. Em termos de desenho também não é muito agradável. Mas é uma obra-prima de matemática. Lá isso é.

Things change and although this game still is a good game I have to say that at this point of my gaming life T&E is a bit boring, repetitive and dry for what I'm interested in now. The game itself is good, it scales well with 2 to 4 players and it has a good abstract idea but I don't like to play it anymore.

An excellent and most satisfying game for 3 players. Unfortunately, 4 player games tend to get a little too chaotic due to near incessant conflicts.

This game is fantastic!!  T&E is my favorite game by a country mile.  I've bought two copies and will soon buy the reprint.  I would love a "super fancy kickstarter" version.  I don't think there's a better game for 4 players (preferably equally-experienced players).  Playing with 3 players is very good, but not quite as amazing as with 4.  The only complaint I might have with the 4 player game is that it ends too soon.  I've considered a variant where during a tile discard players (at their option, once per game) disclose their hand and put it back in the bag.   Fans of pure-strategy games may lament the lack of control at times, and some might characterize the game as more of an "experience" game than anything else, but because of the variety of the tile draw every game plays out differently.

Fascinating game that I've only played a couple times.  One reviewer here called it the most unintuitive game he ever played, and I had exactly the same experience, which (strangely) is part of the game's charm.  Has some of the most original mechanics I've ever seen. 

Update: Raised from 7 to 8.  This one's a tense, brutal powerhouse with some wacky attack mechanics that I still haven't wrapped my brain around.  Although I tend to get a bit lost when playing this, I gotta give this game the respect it deserves.

I've got more than a dozen plays under my belt and stil don't feel like I've mastered anything about it. Also most of my games have been two-player, and I'd really like to get some three and four player games in. Word to the wise, don't try to teach this to non-gamers. The internal vs external struggle will baffle them. My wife won't come near this with a ten foot pole now.

*Update* 12/2008 - I eventually traded this off and don't regret it.

T&E has some nifty mechanics, but in the end, it feels clumbsy to me, players are very much at the mercy of the tile draws. When you get red ones, you can do well, but sometimes you get red tiles and you think you have enough to find out that your opponent either lucked into or saved more than you and you're dead in the water. Perhaps there are hidden mysteries to the game that I'm missing, but after 20 plays I've given up on it.

RATING: 8
Combining considerable depth with the elusive fun factor, Tigris and Euphrates was both easier to teach (my wife) and harder to teach (my friends) than I thought it would be.  So far, the game plays near to perfection except for the random tile draw.  If the game were a little shorter, it wouldn't bug me as much, but 90 minutes can be aggravating when you just can't get any red.  That said, it is a near perfect game, and I may bump it to a ten after some more playthroughs.

A few of the more negative comments have said that the game just "isn't fun" and I have to say, I agree.  It's more than a little abstract and it just makes my head hurt playing it.  It's also not what I would call a very "social" game.

Based on many plays.  A very elegant game.  It is easy to understand the rules, but very hard to play well. I really look forward to playing this game and want it always leaves me wanting to play it again and figure out how to do better.  A great game to think about and learn. Even though this game doesn't have a strong theme I really think it embodies what I like.  A game that is very intuitive to learn the rules, but very difficult to master and play.  A definate brain burner.  Also it is great for the odd times you have three players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[Mayfair Games 'Tigris & Euphrat' 2003 edition] {Civilization; tile-laying; optimal 4p} T&E is a classic Knizia's game but it's hard to find 4 suitable players. It's thematic and full of player interaction and confrontation. It's deep but not highly unforgiving. It supports both strategies and tactical moves. The luck in tile draws is very minor; it will not affect the play, when playing wisely. Actually, I like the tile draw because it makes the game more fun and dynamic.

5/8/10: 1st play.  Wow!  For a set of relatively simple rules (there are a few too many fiddly exceptions to make them just "simple"), this game seems awfully dynamic.  There's a [b]lot[/b] going on in this 1-1.5 hour slugfest.  I already see layers upon layers going on here, and unlike a game like Chess or Go, I don't feel like it's totally impenetrable.  This is staying in my collection for quite awhile, I think.

RATING: 9
One of the best games I know, without a doubt I think E&T is one of  the single best true board games in my opinion. There is just not enough action points to accomplish everything you would like and the tile draw mechanism limits your ability to make extremely long term plans, therefore your left with a wonderfully long (playing time) game with nearly all tactical decisions. It's not something I would look for in a wargame, but in a board game I think this design is terrific.


 Also despite all the comments to the contrary, the rule are pretty simple.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love it.  Though it is esentially an abstract game, the theme helps draw in unsuspecting players, who have invariably (so far) enjoyed themselves.
Yes, bad tile draws can make life hard for a few turns.  However, overcoming the randomness of the draws is the point of the exercise.  Good with 2, 3, and 4 players.  The Hans im Gluck edition is gorgeous.

RATING: 9
A truly excellent game. It is simple enough to teach to people with only a weak interest in board games, but has enough strategy to satisfy the hardcore gamer. I don't give this game a 10 becasue I don't think it has realized its full potential. It has the potential to be scaled for different numbers of players. I think it would work better as a series of large tiles rather than a fixed board. The hidden scoring system needs some work. The turn sequence and victory conditions in four players can tend to leave #4 at a bit of a disadvantage. I love the game mechanics and extreme subtlety of strategy. When at first you don't succeed in this game, there is always a new strategy opening to you. This game won't leave a player feeling like they are so far behind they can't catch up. I've seen very few games of this caliber and I would recommend it to anyone.

RATING: 8
Wow...This is perhaps the only Eurogame that has really blown me away.  Lots of interesting options, short-term and long-term planning, and...conflict!  Glorious, underrated conflict!  Without a kingmaking problem!  Hats off to RK, definitely my favorite Eurogame with this degree of abstraction.  UPDATE:  OK, it's probably NOT as good as Samurai, which accomplishes a lot of the same stuff in a shorter game with less random screwage.  SECOND UPDATE:  Downgraded again--it IS a terrific game, but I wouldn't elect to play it over several lower-rated games, so I guess I should boot it down.  May just be a bit lacking in the "fun" department.

THIRD UPDATE:  Played twice recently.  No, it really is an excellent game.  Too bad the red tiles are a touch too important, but other than that it's excellent.

Another classic Knizia game that has stood the test of time. The interesting decisions and confrontations that this game brings out is great. The only reason it loses a couple of points is due to how aggressive the game can get and how kingmaker-y it can be with people who don't know what they are doing. Also, the game can be extremely frustrating if you don't get a decent number of red tiles to use Internal Conflicts. Still a classic and I enjoy it with the expansion (the other map with two "4" space river places) and the Ziggurat expansion (the + building that gives 1 color of your choice).

Dio Knizijine 'tile placement trilogije'. Kad bih morao birati samo jednu igru, to bi bila ova. Ultimativni tile placement. Svjetska klasa igrača kaže da je malo nagnuta prema prvom igraču ali rekao bih da je to klasa 'Kasparov'. Nama smrtnicima ipak prije zatrokira mozak kad se iz vreće pojavi neočekivani tajl, tako da je posve ok izbalansirana. Iako je Knizija pomalo kratak s narativom, ovdje je iz nekog razloga baš fino pogodio dinamiku konstantne mijene moći. Svi uglavnom grade, civlizacija stalno raste, samo kad se sudari sama sa sobom brzo dolazi do pražnjenja potencijala kroz sudar vizija i eto ipak se nekako razruši - pri čemu tajlovi/narod odlaze kvragu a bodovi odlaze pobjedničkoj dinastiji. Poražena se dinastija, kao i u stvarnosti, samo povuče do slijedeće prilike...

Really enjoyed this, keen to give it another go now that I understand the rules and strategy a bit better. The simple mechanic of scoring only your lowest colour is typically fiendish Knizia brilliance, ensuring a rich game of varied strategies, rather than allowing one player to find the most lucrative way to score points and milking that from the first turn.

Might be better to allow the large scoring cubes to represent 3 points instead of 5, since there was at least one occasion in the game that I played where a player was forced to reveal that he had less than five of a particular colour, when there were no small cubes of that colour left, and he was unable to supply 'change' for a large cube. Quite a disadvantage when it's late in the game and everyone is alerted to your weakest colour.

Super dry and lifeless, it is nevertheless a very smart abstract game that is interesting strategically with four players.  It's not good at two players because it is too easy for one player to avoid interaction and just do their own thing for a large portion of the game.  A major game weakness is that it it is easy to find yourself hopelessly behind if you lose a couple key battles/conflicts early and then you become mostly a spectator.  Also, sometimes those battles come down to whoever happened to get the better draw, which is not known until the battle occurs.  Building temples seems pointless as it takes a lot of build but very hard to hold on to (as it then becomes a major target for other players to acquire).  All this being said, it is a brilliant game.  However, if I never feel inspired to play it, it's hard to give it a high rating.

One of the top three Knizia 'big' games (E&T, Modern Art, Medici) for me, and in a way all of them share a common feel: each will give you plenty to think about, are undeniably abstract in some way, and have a marked element of luck (tile draw, card deal/=, or card pull respectively). But would the games be better without this luck element? I doubt it.

A deep game about the rise and fall of kingdoms, wars, coups, monuments to the gods, and obtaining different coloured wooden cubes. I don't find this to be too abstract. I don't find the rules to be too difficult. If you explain the internal conflicts as <i>coups</i> and the external conflicts as <i>wars</i>, and point out that the king (black leader) needs to build barracks (black tiles) to wage a war, the theme really helps people remember the rules.

Abstract, but not so much for me, this game reserves always great match. Tiles placement (I'm loving it), a lot of interaction between players, modular map always changing during play, no downtime, beautiful component (Hans im gluck). A brain-burner!

Update: Rating up from 8 to 8.4 after a bunch more plays. This really is a modern day classic and it's a shame not enough people are still playing it as frequently as it deserves.

Own the app. I love it mechanically, but unfortunately my rating is based entirely on the mechanics on some theoretical level, as the AI is disappointingly easy.

I like the dynamic (you can put your leaders on the hole board).A conflict can change a lot. Sometimes there are many conflicts, sometimes a peacefull beginning, and then a big fight. Sometimes there are many monuments sometimes no one.

You must play to the end, because of the scoring. Your are only so strong, like your worst colour. You must see also the consequence of conflicts and know when use a disaster.

I seem to rate things based on their fun value more heavily then other game qualities.  That being said, I didn't find this fun.  The fact the tiles don't fit the board annoyed me to no end as well.  While mechanically a pretty good little game its highly random and I question alot of the strategy behind it.  For the most part you can tell very quickly who is going to win/lose.  While I wont say that in many ways this is an ALRIGHT game, I just don't think its something I would ever want to own/play.

Why do I like this game so much? I think it's that everyone scores by their weakest area. So, you have to have a balanced civilization. Plus, you don't own any tiles (although people get territorial) so you're never down and out. You can always bump another player’s leader out of a kingdom if they are in a better position than you.

Rating after three games:

I can see there's a lot of depth to this game, even though it requires a bit of luck when it comes to drawing the tiles (it's still the best tile placement game I've tried).

All in all I'm having a blast playing it even though I'm doing it all wrong and lose every game I play...

edit: Rating after four plays. This gets better and better. Increased rating.

edit: After a few more games I've come to realize that this truly is a masterpiece. Knizia's finest! Rating increased.

This is an enormously tough rating, because as a game, its mechanics, theme, and sheer elegance merit a rating above 9, perhaps even a 10.  However, I ask myself, "Given a group, would this be one of the first games I'd suggest playing?" and the answer would likely be "No," because it requires a very unique group of people, true gamers, to really appreciate the brilliance of this one.  Perhaps my feelings will change.

Everything about this game is nearly perfect for me. Lots of choices in what to do and never enough moves to do everything you want. Interesting scoring mechanism. Multiple end conditions. Tactical and strategic planning. Different types of conflict. Fluidity of board and pieces. Lots of things to keep track of.

Note for those of you considering this game: I was really frustrated with this game the first time I played because I was overwhelmed and took a long time to figure out what to do each turn. Then, after thinking for a long while, I would go to make my moves and was told that I couldn't due to the subtleties in the rules I had overlooked.

You need to give this game some time to learn the rules and understand what all of your options are. No, this isn't a game for everyone.

I have only played a couple of games, so I am probably missing something, and my rating will probably go up someday, but this game simply does not appeal to me.  The theme is obviously pasted on (even for a Knizia game, the theme just doesn't fit), and the confrontation aspect does not work with some of the people I game with (read: my wife).  All of that being said, I must admit that there is a lot to this game, definitely more than I have picked up, and someday I will probably have to grab another copy (maybe when they reprint it with decent artwork).

Update: After playing an actual game (that is, with gamers), I can see why this game is so highly rated.  My winning may have had something to do with how much I enjoyed the game, but there is so much to about this game to recommend it.  The constant tension, and the options available on any turn...  I will definitely have to re-acquire it.

I picked up the iOS version when it was released in November, 2011. Thanks to boardgamegeek's implementation of this game, I've played it a lot over the years. Having AI and easy access to online multiplayer is excellent, and I will continues to play this game for years.

I finally picked up the board game version of E&T, the Mayfair 1st Edition, in a BGG auction.

2013 update:  As you can tell, I rarely give out 10's to a game, and E&T was my first one.  I've played this game more than 1,000 times on the iOS implementation, and thus, have started to wean myself away for a while.  In no way will I stop playing this game, I still enjoy it for all the right reasons!

No reservations: I love Tigris & Euphrates. It combines the best of board and card gaming into one delightfully confrontational package, and continues to impress more than a decade after release. It's a wonderful tile-laying game that emphasizes territory control, direct confrontation, and balance -- not only (obviously) in the scoring mechanics, but also in knowing when and where to attack. As I continue to play against experienced players, the strategies of this game open up in new and interesting ways. I want to play more and more.

The goal of the game is to collect resource cubes (now cardboard chits in the latest edition -- Boo!), which come in four colors. In what is now classic Knizia fashion, you must collect complete sets of cubes in order to score victory points. So for example, if you have 4 green, 1 red, 5 blue, and 3 black, you still only score one point because you only have one complete set of four. As a result, you are forced to participate in all aspects of the game. You cannot focus on a single color, and you cannot avoid certain confrontations.

Set in ancient times, the theme exudes the feeling of civilizations struggling for dominance and relevance. Yet your turns are a straightforward exercise in placing tiles on a map depicting the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Some people complain that the game is dry as desert dust. I disagree. However, the theme is not contained in elaborate event cards or fancy miniatures. Instead, the theme arises organically from gameplay. One tile after another is added to the board. I play a farm here, a temple there. On your turn you add a leader and another farm. The board grows into a scene of struggling tribes spreading across the land. Two civilizations merge, and two competing leaders face off in a struggle for dominance. Only one can win, and the loser is wiped from the map (often with a bunch of his followers). What's not thematic about that?! Let go any assumptions about a designer spoon-feeding theme to you. Instead, know that the theme is in the "feel" of the game. If you can do that, you'll get along just fine.

What you are left with is a game that feels tense, with your plans always on the verge of collapse. Timing when and where to place your tiles is a key skill. Moreover, you absolutely must manage your hand of tiles. The number one complaint I hear about T&E is that "It's all about lucky draws. You either get the tiles you need or you're screwed." There is dash of truth in the latter half of the complaint. You do need certain tiles to perform well. But like all hand management games, the key is in knowing how to save the ones you need for the times when they will have maximum impact. It also means reading the board and the other players. If Suzy across the table just played a boatload of red tiles, then the chances are she doesn't have any left. Now might be a great time to launch that attack with red you've been planning. Your patience will be rewarded now that the timing is right.

Do things always work out in your favor? Do you have perfect control over your fate? No, of course not. But the same is true for any number of card games. You must balance luck against odds, timing with knowledge.

The heart of T&E is its focus on a few core mechanics as well as its dedication to balance. From these concepts comes a game that will make you angry, proud, tense, and excited all at once. And it will manage all this in 90 minutes or less. It's a stalwart of boardgaming for a reason, and well worth playing -- especially now that it's back in print with a (for the most part) excellent edition.

Tigris & Euphrates just misses out on my top tier of games because it lacks a little of the fun factor that is so important to me.  We haven't played enough to escape that "Oh I won? Really?" sort of feeling at the end of games.  At the same time, I can tell that there is a lot more depth to be explored here.  I suspect that my rating might bump up a point if I can get this to the table a few more times.

I can explain the rules very easily to others, and myself think It's a well designed and wonderful game. "lucky" doesn't exist if you get the different ways do get points.

And I play almost everyday on the app, that is a nice conversion.

OK, OK. I admit it. A good game. But despite all the praise and hoopla, it does have flaws: 1) The inevitable "hesitate while I contemplate every possible spot for this tile placement" delay; 2) It's VERY unforgiving: One poor placement can affect everything else on the board and result in an interconnected trail of tears; and 3) the tendency to induce a 1.5-hour ice cream headache.

The scoring in this game is one of the more trying things. I find the game a lot more entertaining online when the book keeping is taken care of for me.

I LOVE this game!  An absolute masterpiece abstract game on the rise and fall of early civilizations.  Plays in less then an hour almost always, unless I'm on the advanced map then it is more like 1.5 - 1.75 hrs.  This is really impressive because my group is almost always slower then the time on the box.  The only bad things about this game that it is abstract and a little slow to teach and is it is confrontational and so my wife doesn't like it.

Tigris & Euphrates is one of the pinnacles of the designer's brain-burning, tile-laying efforts, and either you love it or you don't.  Watching the potential conflicts advance towards each other and then explode like a firecracker is fantastic.  Resolving the winners of each is a simple math problem. The whole experience takes on a chess-like gravity.  The new FF edition makes the game slightly more approachable.

T&E encourages ingenuity, aggression, long-term strategic planning, and tactical responsiveness.  There is an incredible variety of strategic actions that can be made each turn, so the game gives the players plenty of opportunity to do something very clever or very stupid.  I appreciate that.  It's an intense (though strangely unemotional) game that doesn't at all try to herd the players into only considering a narrow, obvious path of optimal actions, a fault that many other popular Euros are guilty of.  This is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's masterpiece.  I understand how it got that reputation, even if I don't quite hold it in the same regard (I'm a much bigger fan of his Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation).

I am a bit disappointed with how abstract it feels while playing.  I think the theme is well integrated with the rules set but perhaps has too little influence on the players' actions.  I guess the theme is there in theory but absent in practice.  On the other hand, how many abstracts can boast such a strong theme?

UPDATE 1: I think I've underrated this one.  I'd like to try it again.

UPDATE 2: Yup, I did underrate it.  This is a supreme game.  A very entertaining and intricate brain-burner.

Your chances in this game are a tad too tied in to the tiles you choose, but plotting how to maximize the potential of your tiles is an entertaining challenge. The best part of this game is watching the kingdoms slowly slide into each other like tectonic plates, sowing ruin and rueing as the plates either destroy each other or meld into a greater kingdom. All the damage you can create and points you can reap with just one well-placed tile is thrilling. Oh, and the funky wooden monuments are fun too. Kids, collect all eight!

RATING: 3
I was having a think about why I don't like this game, but I just couldn't put my finger on it. I mean, I can see it's a technically good game. I was having a conversation with one of my game group about it and he said, "Well, the thing is, it's just so *boring*." That sums it up perfectly for me. Dull as dishwater. I thought that maybe it was because my first game was a two player game, which meant there wasn't that much conflict; but my next game was a four player, and we were all underwhelmed. There seemed to be a general consensus of, "Wow, is that it?" and the game was very quickly put away. I guess that if there's going to be conflict in a game, I'd like it to actually be conflict rather than counting how many tiles I and my opponent have. I know I'm missing the point of the game by saying that - it's a very abstract euro and is meant to be - but this game just didn't light my fires at all...

So far I've only logged online plays. This will be a tough sell with the wife because the strategies lie deep and require a few plays to grasp. I'll update when I decide to introduce it to her.

UPDATE AT 9 PLAYS:

I've played three in-person games vs. six online plays. It plays quickly enough that I prefer a face-to-face experience over an online game. But after nine plays I'm lowering from an 8 to a 7.5 in my rating. I was hoping I would start feeling a little more theme as I played more and learned more. I haven't. In fact, I've felt the opposite. Perhaps it's because I've taught it so many times--I have to talk about each of the colors and that's easier than trying to tell new players about what each color represents. Not sure. I like it, and I know there is decent strategy. But I don't feel the long-term strategy I enjoy. This game feels more tactical and has a strong focus on turn optimization, rather than decent long-term strategy planning.

Update: a few more plays in and I have to say I really enjoy keeping this game around for that classic moment. I recently played it at a CON with a few people who could appreciate the nostalgia of a old-game revisit, and I was glad I had kept it on-hand all these years. I'll be keeping it. What's more, with FFG's release, using plastic minis instead of the chunky wooden pieces in my version, I'm super glad I've held onto it all these years.

Still unsure how to rate this one even after 10+ plays. The game plays differently every time; no two games have been the same. When playing I sense I'm in the presence of greatness but there is something in the back of my mind that just doesn't do it for me. A very aggressive and dynamic game.

10 plays: jury is still out to some extent. I definitely see the cleverness, elegance, and dynamic richness inherent in the game so will leave my rating at 8 for the present. Would like to play with more than 2 players.

Fell in love with this game playing on iOS.  Just got a physical copy. The components are nicer than I thought they would be.  Got the double-sided game with the advanced rules, and I hope will provide a lifetime of replayability!

iOS version.  The app is so/so (crashes a lot), but this game is fantastic.  Simple to learn but very strategically deep with a high degree of interactivity. 
 My only complaints are that I wish the real board version was a little bit prettier (don't really like the Mayfair artwork) and that there was a way to vary/randomize the board setup.

This is a very interesting and very dense tile-placement game.  All sorts of ways to play, choosing your aggression level.  And the final scoring system being based on your LOWEST scoring category is a pretty ingenious way of keeping players from dominating in only one of the four areas of the game.  Pretty neat.

An incredibly deep, simple, and utterly classic modern strategy game. While highly abstract, the game is actually quite thematic, so much so that it feels like a very, very abstract simulation or model of sorts. It all fits together so well. 

Another great example of a game that takes only a small amount of effort to learn, but will continue to surprise you with new possibilities.

The hidden information aspect and the fact that only the lowest score of the four different categories counts as each player's final score make this game hard to call, even up to the last turn, so it's quite exciting.

This is one of those games that feels older than it is. Ancient, like the theme. A masterpiece game, for sure, that will stand the test of time.

After 1 play (02-15-09): Maybe it's just the amount of research I did beforehand, but after one 2p game I honestly don't understand why people find this so hard to learn.  There are a lot of moving parts but not many rules that are weird outside the context of a handful of core concepts.  The interaction of these parts branches into a crazy number of variables--there's a lot to watch, and a lot to track.  It's also VERY tooth-and-nail.  Very pleased with the components on the 2008 Mayfair edition.

Extremely unique game.  I don't really know how to classify it.  I guess it's an abstract game with fighting?

It plays fast, it's deeper than it looks, the rules are simple and crystal clear.

Everyone I have introduced it too had similar reactions of "I'm intrigued and want to play it again, but I wasn't totally sure what I was doing either".

I do think the strategy grows with more plays and a better understanding of the game.

Once you get your head around how the internal and external conflicts work the game becomes very fast. On first play we had finished in about an hour. I can't recommend T&E enough.

Finally played with four.  Wow!!!!!  With four competent players, this can be intense.  Now I just need to become competent.  The gaming system is so pure that the game feels abstract.

I can completely understand that some people out there enjoy this game.  There are people out there who enjoy chess as well.  I personally do not enjoy playing either and this game feels sort of like that.

When I play this game I really feel there is 1 highly crtical element missing for me...fun.

This feels like four-player chess or something. You've got a few types of playing pieces, a map that will never change (i.e. locations of rivers and treasures), and maybe a half-dozen reasonable options on your turn that could have vastly different effects. I can't think of another game to compare it to. Though, I've played very few tile-laying games.

The tile draw is a little iffy for me. I don't mind the randomness and am actually grateful that it may reduce the number of options you currently have. I really don't like the idea of using your tiles to bid and add to your conflict strength though. That makes it feel very arbitrary who wins a conflict that has potentially huge effect.

I really like the differentiation of the four colors (economic sectors). Nothing seems overly complicated or inelegant.

The theme works well. It's not strictly necessary but it doesn't conflict with the mechanics either.

...If you don't remember to use the tile swapping move and don't attack much, it seems the game can outlast its welcome and leave people with nothing useful to do. There may be room to rise above a 7 rating. Needs another play for me to say unfortunately.

I love this game. I like deep games with simple mechanics..and this one accomplish both. Basically, you have to place 2 tiles in your turn to grab points in 4 colors. You have 3 ways to grab pints...placing just tiles, building monuments and...making conflicts! (and a fourth way in the advanced game with civ buildings)...Conflicts are maybe the most difficult mechanic to learn for newbies, but after 2 games it is not a problem. T&E is an ellegant game, with not fiddly issues, I love the theme (I know others disagree, but I see and like the theme in this game)...it is a very tactical game, with many possibilities in your turn, I like each color having different abilities...and it scales nicely for 2,3 or 4 players. 4 players is mostly tactical, you can´t plan too much your next turns, lots of conflicts and comebacks among the players....ITOH 2 players (my favourite and mostly played) is a more strategic and less chaotic game, with a more quiet and lengthy development phase, where you can plan more carefully your next moves...Many players say 2 players becomes boring games, with both players in opposite corners derivating in non-conflict games...I disagree at all...experienced players know you must be aggressive to win this game, turtling is nearly a defeat vs an experienced player...BTW I recommend to teach this game to a newbie covering the left third of the board (11x11), with only 6 treasures and 2/3 of the tiles, before playing full board.

Such a great classic semi-abstract game by Knizia. I love playing it even though I apparently have no idea how to play the right strategy.

I played this once with three and really enjoyed it – need to play more to see if it locks in and stays with me

It's a while after the game and I'm thinking about it – simple yet very deep – I am drawn to it at this point

Have now played with four and on both sides of the board - loved it and played back-2-back

This is one of my favorite games at this point, ultimately variable and I can see every game being different 

When you first sit down you see silly little cardboard squares - but once you understand the mechanisms in the game it transcends the cardboard - truly a great game

I just love jumping into this soup. This is not a game you can control but momentarily, the probabilities can collapse into a crazy event horizon that sucks you right off the board and into your lap, and one must have the sort of gumption to pop right back out there. There are opportunities for shared incentive structures, opportunities to suddenly drive the game, passing intricate decisions to the next player, and enough drama to make you weep or scream.

I may like this more than Brass. It has an ability to get 'farther off the books' if you know what I mean. It's very open and such pure spatial thinking it has a direct, raw hormonal charge in every play.

Games like this set up certain moments, a creative play or setting up a skillful cascade that one manages to surf (with always the risk that the wave takes you down). It has such a fine ratio of all the constituents of interactivity. It is an exemplar of gathering them in a ratio that pleases me very much.

I think everyone gets called a bastard at least once. 

Which I think precipitates the whole overhead thing down out of the clouds. By overhead I mean the ratio of qualitative thinking one gets to do in game, the why of a move, versus the tax of how to do something, or solving riddles rather than engaging dynamics. The more of a bastard you can be in a game, the closer you are to the magic, sweet ratio of perfect overhead, whatever the mechanics are.

One of my earliest favorites by R. Knizia!  Tried to learn early on, but not until getting involved with my local game group did the game really reach me.  Now, it's one of my favorite games.  Internal/external conflicts and treasures and building monuments and the unique scoring mechanism of the score in the lowest category! Everything really works great, and it's a whole lot of fun.

Saw this being played in a couple places (Oasis of Fun 2010 and UG XVI 2010) and one player claimed it was the only edition he would play (despised the American version). The board is nice and big, I think I'm more used to the tiles in the other edition, though I'm glad to have this copy.

First impressions: In our 2p learning game, she got frustrated because she wasn't drawing red tiles and didn't have a chance in "revolts", making it seem highly luck-based. But only a learning game; I think we'll get past that.

Couple more games: HUGE disappointment. You draw bad tiles and your opponent draws good ones? You lose. After three or four plays, this seems almost an entirely luck-based game; you might as well play Sorry.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.25
Possibly my favourite game.
So much depth to the strategy and the way the board changes dramatically from move to move is fantastic. Some very good mechanics (the revolt and only lowest colour scores) stop it from just being the player who builds the biggest empire or having runaway leader problems.
Can be hard to teach though. The rules are simple enough but the strategy can be very counter-intuitive ('but thats my Kingdom!'). After a  couple of games it all makes sense and the depth of the game begins to take shape. Great app version available too (which is handy cause its not the easiest game to get to the table).

Tigris and Euphrates is set in ancient Mesopotamia, but the more subtle qualities of the experience are defined by the game design.  Easy to learn the mechanics yet extremely challenging to master, Tigris & Euphrates is everything a game should be. The components are simple but choice, like a well executed Cacio e Pepe.  This is a must own for anyone wanting a deep thought provoking game with plenty of replay value.

I lowered to a score of 8 because I have only played the app version.  I need to see how much calculation time the board game takes to see where it stands overall.

A bit of a brain burner.  Clever mechanics, and 4 players, but starts to feel a bit like Chess after a while.  There's not much laughter to it, no trade, but the bits are nice.

There are so many levels here that it can be difficult finding someone (or 3 someones!) on the same level of understanding, which the game needs.  Otherwise you will win convincingly, or be thrashed.  
Also learning that the deciding factor is actually the tiles that you pull from the bag - there is only so much you can do with poor luck...

Although strategically great it is too abstract to draw you into it. As one reviewer said it best, you never feel connected to your kingdoms.

Great strategy game that it is difficult to wrap your brain around to begin with (some things seem counter-intuitive until you get used to it).

RATING: 9
Great game with phenomenal components. Although quite abstract, each game is involving from beginning to end. This is mainly due to the fact that player turns are short, but seemingly simple actions can have a lot of impact on the situation on the board and the player ranking. There are not a lot of rules to the game, but people find it hard to remember them during the course of their first session. That, however, really is the ONLY drawback I can think of.

I really, *really* want to play this more now that I fully understand the rules (I didn't know you could play Catastrophes over already placed tiles!).

Edit: After a few more plays, I'm starting to cool to it. It's undeniably an excellent game, but I'm have trouble getting a lock on how to stymie a runaway leader. It all seems to come back to two things: initial placement and luck of the draw. 

There are places on the board that are, quite frankly, better than others. It seems much harder to catch up if you've made the mistake of starting in the wrong area. In the few games I've played since I acquired it, there is definitely a point where further play is futile. For an otherwise excellent game, I find this aspect of it truly horrendous.

Knizia's half-abstract epic is so well-crafted it's almost in a league of its own. The engine is there, the theme is there, the art, the strategy, the ever-changing kingdoms, the mighty monuments, the coups, the wars. A unique gaming experience. It's at its absolute best with 3. 2 does not work very well.

Wow, this game is amazing. Nothing short of brilliant. It's a shame it's taken me so long to finally get this to the table. It's an amazing piece of game design, though that's to be expected from Knizia. 

I can see why people complain about not drawing enough red tiles but I don't think it's really an issue. I haven't personally found myself in a situation where I need to win an internal conflict or go bust, and there's a lot of different ways to go about scoring points. I do think that people get a bit too attached to the kingdoms they build. 

4 player is delightfully confrontational, while 3 player is still good, but not as much. It's one of the few games where you're left wondering how you could improve such a design.

Wonderfully thematic and amazing to play!

Did not get a chance to try it at Origins 04, but wish I did.  I talked to some people about it after playing a different brain burner that I didn't like, and they said this is an even bigger brain drain.  I think they intended it to mean that it is very deep and strategic, but at that time, it didn't sound good.  I had other issues, like having trouble getting 4 player games in, and my group tends to like lighter games.<br/><br/>

Six months later, we have been getting into heavier games, and our friends pick up Tigris and Euphrates.  In preparation, I read the rules, and play a half a game on the Java version to get a feel for it.  After waiting for the stars to align (one player does not make it, everyone is in the mood, etc), we get a chance to play it.<br/><br/>

Well, after one real game between four newbies...  There were downtime issues.  We are a AP prone group, but this was worse than our games of Tikal.  There was so much to learn and consider during this first game that I'm not entirely sure how much I enjoyed it.  I do like it, and I tend to like heavier games.  Also, everyone seemed to enjoy it too, but the real proof will be if they want to play it again.  I also think the downtime issues should not normally be so bad.

I have played the digital version of this game tons of times, unfortunately the physical game doesn't get table time that often. The physical game can be a bit fiddly. I love this game, especially the deep tactical choices and the game end scoring mechanism. Because the 'highest lowest score' wins, you have to chase the points in categories that you are not doing well in, which might demand some aggressive play. Priorities are shifting during the game, which is something I very much enjoy.

Initial impression - limited plays
I recognize some decent game design here, but it seemed luck had a very large hand in the winner.  Also who is playing (and their general approach to playing games) can end up having a say in the winner.  All in all not really my style for a game.

RATING: 9.5
Only 2 plays so far. Need more! But I can already appreciate the brilliancy of this design.

4 plays. Got cleaned out in the last two. Some experimental aggressive play, bad play, and some bad luck. Felt like I couldn't see anything, 0 imagination. On turn 2, I was regretting the turn 1 move, on turn 3, regretting the turn 2 move, etc. Really frustrating. I need to understand this better.

One of the first serious board game purchases I made.  This just doesn't grab me.  It's a little too random for my liking.  The tile draws make you behave tactically based on what you've received.  I enjoy the confrontation.  But I'd rather play other games than this.

Pobably our favorite 3-player game. T&E is wonderfully tense as each turn you are faced with so many choices. This is a short to medium-length game, but unlike some of the other euros I've played, this one doesn't end right when the game is getting good. You get to savor the game and it's a nail-biter to the end. Plus I like the vaguely pasted-on theme. Original Mayfair edition.

I've become a bit obsessed with this game, I like it more and more each time I play it.  The constantly shifting puzzle and thrill of taking risks on what other players might have in their  hand.  I really love every second of it.  

The one little hit I give it is that there is a luck of the draw element.  That's part of it's charm, trying to do the best with what you are given and find ways to do a lot with a little... but sometimes you'll just NEVER see a single color and there's only so much that you can do.

I wish this game was a little more newbie-friendly, but once you get through the rules, it's extremely well balanced.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game.  The strategy opens before you the more you play to a seemingly endless degree.  Very simple to play, but hard to master.  A little tough on a new player, as it seems more complicated than it actually is.  Plus, the concept of "you are a symbol, not a color" is counter-intuitive to every instinct I have about board games.  If not for those small complaints and minor component issues, it would be ranked higher, because I feel like this is my favorite game, and probably the best overall game ever made.  Even the random element in this game doesn't bother me nearly as much as in other games, as, although it is a pretty fair part of gameplay, the game beautifully wraps itself around chance by making it feel like an integral part of the story and shaping of the game, instead of just arbitrarily rewarding bad play and punishing good play.

One of the best Knizia games but just far too abstract for my taste. Also game-state parsing is very unintuitive and luck of the draw is ever present and plays a big deal in whether you can attack or even defend as well as getting any reasonable scores. I just get the impression that there is basically no way to score in a color unless you draw tiles of that color, because the right tile colors are needed to get the 1 cube placement bonus, in external battle. Only when leeching off monuments and if you would maneuver very carefully could you in theory gain a color without support from good draws.

Rich game that has the continued capacity to surprise me after many plays.  It's replayable, it's got a perfect amount of chaos and hidden information, and lots of meaty tactical decisions.  You have a modicum of control over your hand, and it's all about getting what you need with what you got.  I enjoy the constant threat of conflict hanging over your head.  You only have so many tiles, so what do you keep?  What do you spend?  When do you refresh your hand?  Fast-moving and consistently throwing new decisions at you, this game does everything a Euro should.

Didn't like this game at first but I kept mulling over the game for a couple of weeks afterwards. Mulled long enough to buy. Good thing I did so because this is a fun-filled jaunt to be sure.

After playing eight games over the years with different kinds of people, I must say this is a really good game. Understanding conflicts might take a game or two, otherwise the game is quite simple - in a good way. Every game is a little bit different than the others. The latest game was first one for me in ages (same for couple of other players, too) and we made a lots of stupid errors, because we didn't remember all the rules and our tactics were mediocre at best. This only made me to want to play this more.

Good tile game.

Update after ninth game, it was over a year since the last game for me and the others. There were only three players, and I believe the game is better with four.

Another three player play for this year. Four would be better.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

An amazingly well-designed game that's like nothing else I've played. The closest comparison in my game collection is Eclipse (which also involves civilisation building and attacking). It's reasonably easy to learn, but strategically and tactically complex. Hard to master with lots of replay value.

It's a tile-laying game where you build a city (using different tiles) and attack your city-building opponents. 

The theme is very strong. You feel like you're building a defensible city in the cradle of civilisation and attacking your opponents across the river.

The game's depth means it's hard to play well when tired. For this reason, it gets played less in our house than Dominion or Through the Desert. 

The iPad game is a no brainer. A brilliant way to pass a train journey, especially with a friend using the pass-and-play mode.

It is easy to see how this game is considered a 'classic'. I really like to the win condition in this game - that you have to do a little bit of everything, ensuring that you do reasonably well in all "colours". A lot of strategy goes into this game, and it really rewards clever play.

RATING: 8
Although at a highly abstracted level, I find the rules of Tigris & Euphrates to be thematically evocative. The tactical decisions in this game can be excruciating when conflicts are at hand. The luck of the tile draw is an influence but is also an element to be managed with skill, using the tiles you get to your best advantage and knowing when it would actually be best to spend an action swapping them. Overall a classic of board game design, and unlike any other game.

This is a tough game to get your head around.  For one, it's hard to get over the "This is mine!" mindset of building up a particular kingdom; for another, it's just hard to get the difference between internal and external conflicts, especially in the first few games.  The game does seem to suffer some from the draw of the tiles, but I think that clever use of leaders and monuments should overcome it.  I like it so far.

It's a very good game (thus the 8), but my personal enjoyment of it is not that great; if I had my choice of any Knizia game to play, I would almost certainly chose Ra or Amun Re over this one, even though this might objectively be the better game. I'm not particularly fond of the directness of the player interaction mixed with the randomness of the tile drawing.

I really wanted to love this, with its amazing board and bits, little monuments, and its intriguing mechanic and dynamics.

Magnificent.

So much I could say about this game. It has an epic feel and ends in such tense game play. Incredibly simple rules, incredibly deep outcome. This is one I think would take a lot of plays before I start to get a grip on which strategies are more effective. Even if I did there is all the emergent gameplay from the other players to consider.

Very impressed. One play so far but been thinking about it since. Feels like what chess should be like.

Thinking about this game a lot and keen to get it to the table again. May be the best game I've ever played. Felt like it deserved an ovation after my first play.

Generally speaking, I am usually not a fan of Reiner Knizia's cold, abstract style of game design. Most of his games seem to boil down to set collecting or some other boring numerical calculation. His themes are so pasted on that I often wonder if he even bothers to think about a theme while he is designing. I envision his game lab as a pack of Uno cards and a sheet of graph paper, the genesis of all his creations.

Tigris and Euphrates however, is a very different beast. It's still incredibly abstract, but here the theme is very tightly integrated. T&E uses tile laying to represent the growth and management of an ancient Mesopotamian empire. You aren't playing buildings or claiming roles, there are no money or resource issues to manage, nor are there any technologies to research. Despite this, the civilization theme still comes bubbling up with surprising effectiveness.

The tiles turn the whole concept of an empire building game on it's head by representing all of the various aspects of civilization on a mere four tile types. By following a few placement rules, you start to see empires grow and contract as they encounter other groups of tiles. Again, it is so unbelievably abstract that it should be nonsense, yet I really feel like I am managing an empire when I play. Like other Civ games, there is a need for expansion, but expanding weakens your civilization and opens you up to attack from other competing kingdoms. I'm not sure how Tigris and Euphrates pulls it off, but this giant pile of abstract nothingness tells a fascinating story every time I play.

As a side note, it also features one of the most interesting victory conditions I have ever run across. At the end of the game, everyone compares their score according to the area they were least successful in. The best of the worst scores wins. Like the rest of the game, that doesn't SEEM to make any sense, until you play it. You'll see that it does...and it's brilliant.

Bellissimo gioco di piazzamento sul fantomatico svilluppo delle civilta lunghe le sponde dei fiumi Tigri ed Eufrate, in realtà il gioco è assolutamente astratto e slegato dal tema ma c'è moltissima interazione ed un sistema di punteggio molto interessante.

Haven't figured out what to do in this game. Choices have interesting consequences, but aren't easy to weigh against each other, making tactics besides "play a couple of tiles to gain cubes of a color you are weak in" less favorable.

A pretty good game but I'm not a fan of drawing tiles (I don't mind drawing cubes... go figure), especially from a communal bag. BUT, the game is great. Pretty abstract but the rule of your lowest score is your actual score is a piece of genius and really makes this game shine.

Its a great game if yo are playing a computer version like the one here at BGG.  Otherwise the scoring and tedious rules make it hard to concentrate on strategy soemtimes.  I prefer the computer scored version.  It is more fun and the PC does all the drudgery.

A Knizia tile-laying game with Ingenious-type scoring. Civilizations grow on the board, and you get points for laying down tiles, having internal/external conflicts inside/outside your civilization, and controlling temples. The types of strategies and things that can happen seem large, which makes it a good game. I like it.

Wow, great game! It's not that hard to understand the game, but it's hard to play it well on a competitive level, especially with experienced players. But after playing the game 3/4 times you will be able to compete with the ET die-hards. Not to say you'll win...

RATING: 6
I'm torn on this. I respect it more than I like it. The theme doesn't work well for me, and the luck of the draw invariably produces a moment (or two, or three) of complete frustration for at least one player. But it's an interesting and subtle game, and I'm glad I own it.

I don't really like (and am not good at) inferences based on hidden information, and that's pivotal here. And of course, like poker, you can play "correctly" and still get hosed. Over time, skill wins out, but to me, there's a lot of uninteresting luck here.

Am a bit surprised that the turn order bias hasn't generated too much wrath, and am also surprised that Knizia's purportedly legendary playtesting didn't sniff it out and compensate (pretty easy to do, really).

RATING: 9
Excellent confrontational tile-laying game.  The slowest road to victory is peaceful building (unless your opponents let you milk monuments, which they shouldn't), the fastest is ruthless warmongering.  I really love it when games incentivize conflict and interaction over solitary turtling, and T&E does this fantastically well.

The strategy in the game is kind of opaque.  That is, it's hard to see how to play well armed only with the rules.  At first, people tend to think of kingdoms as belonging to them and overcommit to building up and defending their turf.  Kingdoms are really just abstract point-generating farms though, to be abandoned and commandeered, shared and fought over as each player's immediate point needs dictate.  Once you start to figure this out, the game becomes far more dynamic and interesting.  (The flip side of this is that if you're looking for a peaceful Euro-y civ builder, this ain't it.)

I really don't like multiplayer confrontative games where there is no mechanism implemented against kingmaking, but I went into trying this knowing this is that kind of game, but it's made so much worse by the insane luck factor of the draw, which basically decides all your battles that I couldn't believe I hate the game this much. Is this just a classic because people can feel smart when they understand the difference beetween internal and external conflict?

I tried playing this on iOS and routinely failed because I had no idea what was going on. A friend of mine kept showing up to meetups with the game and I asked him to teach it at some point. 

After learning it in person, I realized that this is a great game, but maybe one that won't hit the table too often. I have a copy, but I haven't cracked it open yet and it's been a while since I've played it. Still, this is a very good game and an example of why Knizia is popular despite the majority of his games being boring.

While this game is a bit weak in the theme department it more than makes up for it in the strategy department.  After I play this game I usually feel like I could have played better, and I'm optimistic that I can improve my score.  This element to the game play is what I like best, that the game can be learned pretty easily, but it's a bit more difficult to master, so it endures from one play to the next.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The unique mechanism by which one scores with the category where one has the least points is in my opinion one of the best parts of the game in that it changes the entire nature of play. This is a themed abstract with slightly limited information but is definitely a strategy game.

This is for me not one of those games where once gets a rush like the thrill of achieving objectives in a wargame but it's still an excellent game.

Also, it's one of my wife's favorites.

In general, I don't like games that make me feel like I'm stupid. I've played T&E three times now, and this game makes me feel like I'm a three-year-old trying to solve a quadratic equation. The board is constantly changing, and in a split second, something you do on one side of the board can have a huge impact on what's happening on the other side. The fact that you have to look for symbols rather than player colors and that the players' tiles and cubes are hidden information doesn't help. I'm not saying I hate the game, I'm just saying it's way too complex for me to visualize. For me, playing T&E is like walking into a minefield wearing a blindfold.

Amazing masterpiece! So much freedom, so much player interaction.. It has a lot going on yet there isn't much to the mechanics, it's hard to explain.

Masterpiece by Reiner Knizia - in this game players build civilizations by laying tiles that represent religion, trade, farming & nobility.  This is a heavy, strategic game full of conflict, with excellent balance of luck.  When you 'attack' a kingdom there is no way to know what reinforcements they have hidden.  There are also tons of interesting decisions to make, like whether to start a conflict, build a monument, or save up certain tiles for future defense.  The end-game scoring is brilliant and forces players to not neglect their weakest areas.       Despite everything going on, turns are fast with players each doing only 2 actions per turn.  Amazing game!

This is a game that I want to like. I seem to enjoy it a little more each time I play it but it's certainly an acquired taste. Most people in our group were not huge fans after a play or two, it took some time to warm up to. It's certainly a nice tile laying game.

Excellent blending of wargame mechanics, tile placement, and worker placement.  Negatives are the randomness in the tile draw, and the pasted-on theme.  There is little difference in the four leader types (other than slight advantages for the Trader and the King), and the tile types are also meaningless (other than the red tiles representing Templates which are all-important in the Internal Conflicts.  Despite the lack of theme, it is an excellent abstract strategy game that requires a couple plays to figure out what works and what doesn't.

Played lots of times (mainly with 4 players). I was impressed and a bit overwhelmed when I discovered this game, and it took several plays before I really started appreciating it. The game is very tense, with so many things you would like to do on your turn, and it requires both tactical finesse and strategical planning. The scoring system is a clever idea, and the thematic feel is good enough - at least for me. Luck is a small factor, but in some rare cases, it can unfortunately affect the overall result dramatically.

Last session we played 15 second turns (take the bag.  play 2 tiles.  draw 2 tiles.  pass the bag.) and it was a blast.  The mechanics on turns without conflicts are so simple.  Yet I've also played slow analytic games.  This game has great range in play styles which are all enjoyable.

I had never heard of this game until I discovered funagain.com (through which I discovered this site, and also have spent WAY too much money. But I'm off topic) It was the first German game I bought, and it did not disappoint. Great fun, subtle, hard to figure out the winning strategies from game to game. I lose all the time. The scoring system is a stroke of genius.

Great game. Scoring - though simple - takes a bit to digest and then apply for noobs. The difference between internal and external conflicts needs to be repeated and repeated unit it to is assimilated and becomes natural thinking - especially for new players. The game takes a bit of an investment to improve and enjoy. The luck of the tile pull did not bother me as much as it does others... in a sense it is a rather dry game... and tile pull helps mitigate that.

When you can get 4 people with enough brain power to effectively play this, it can be a real challenge, and alot of fun.  Things can go from bad to good and back to bad in a hurry, as it's nearly impossible to calculate all the possible outcomes of conflicts.

There is certainly much depth and replayability in the game and it is achieved amazingly without using cards. Watching how the board develops is key to doing well.

Interaction between players is also high as the design discourages turtling. Scalability of the game is good and it plays well with as few as 2 players.

The theme is subtle but reasonably well-integrated.

The quality of the game components is good. I would have preferred some sort of more thematic tokens for the four categories' victory points, though that is just a minor point.

An elegant, stylish game with incredibly high replay value -- for the right crowd. But that ain't me. The novel mechanics and actual gameplay strategies can be difficult to grasp at first, creating a barrier to entry for the new or casual gamer. Oddly enough, the more I play, the less I enjoy T&E... My rating has dropped from a 9 to a 6 over the last 2 years, but has hovered back up to a 7.

[b]ON THE FENCE...[/b]

You give the game an "7" and you're on the fence?
Yep! I am inexplicably drawn to this game-design architecture. There is a mysterious energy that washes over me, whenever presented with a boardgame that uses tile-laying over a grid-like playing surface, as a game mechanic. When playing, I feel like I'm a Roman craftsman, laying down a mosiac for a toga-wearing Praetor in his opulent bathing chamber.

The magic of this game sparkles on even the most starless night, like a glowing mist that snatches ships within the Bermuda Triangle.
My Geek-radar pings loudly, demanding I pay attention to a fat target, zeroing-in my crosshairs, when tile-laying games hove into view. That said, this went down like a torpedoed tramp steamer, leaking oil, clouds of pitch-black smoke belching from a gashes to the hull, on a storm-tossed sea, with my usual group on first play. Second play was much improved.

Will shelve until the time is right, or the stars line up, or something.

Deep. Dry. Long. Abstract.

I really enjoy the decisions to be made in this game and particularly love always needing that third move to bring in the killer play (who doesn't like being constantly frustrated? :laugh: )  Watching the rise and fall of the tile civilizations is interesting and planning out your conflicts is fun.  I see where the random tile draw can limit your options at times, but didn't feel that it was a game breaker... unless you just can't draw any red tiles.

Color me impressed.  There is a very deep and strategic game in this little box of wonders.  The way how quickly kingdoms can be lost and gained, territories blocked and connected, there is never a dull moment.  The randomness come with the tile drawing could and probably will always be a source of frustration, but for me this can be tolerated in the light of such intriguing mechanics.  Even the scoring itself is interesting, since you compare your lowest color victory points rather than the highest, so it is bad to end up with too many of one sphere.  I really enjoyed my first play of T&E, looking forward to try it again and again.

Not one of my favourite. It's good, but I don't think it deserves to be the 2nd best game of all times. It has gorgeous mechanics, but it's too long and get tedious after a while. It has to be played in 4 to be fully appreciated. In 2 it's quite boring.

I think it's brilliant that you have to balance your VP's between all types. There are interaction (well if you play with more than two players), and there are good strategies, spiced up with a bit of screw your neighbour.
It's also brilliant that if you get thrown out of a kingdom then you always have the possibility to get back.
This is a really good game, but not a brain burner.
It'll become a favourite soon.
Online plays are not counted here.
After a lot of online plays it seems it's not a good 2 player game after all. Well I don't see any serious issues with it, but my adversary does.

Play speed and stratigic feel is similar to "Aquire". Major differences are that players have far more options available to them each turn than in Acquire and players have real and direct impact on one another during the course of the game.

After just reading the rules I feared that this is little bit too abstract (whatever "bit too abstract" is...). After first games I'm puzzled, is this a masterpiece or something completely else. Rating will probably rise.

Remek játék! Nem hiába mondják évtized játékának. Reiner Knizia legjobban sikerült játéka! :whistle:

Mindenki egy népet irányít és megpróbál 4 területen kiegyensúlyozottan minél nagyobb befolyásra szert tenni. Ez egyedülálló pontgyűjtési mechanizmus, ugyanis nem az a lényeg minél több pontot gyűjts összességében hanem mindegyik területen egyformán sokat, ugyanis ahol a legkevesebbet gyűjtöttük az lesz a végső pontérték. 

Különleges élményt ad a királyságok összekapcsolása, vagy éppen széjjelrobbantása. Ügyesen kell birodalmunkat megszilárdítani, ugyanis könnyen kirúghatják a trónt a hátsónk alól (általában akkor amikor emlékműveket építgetünk meg civilizációs épületeket, ezek keményen gyengítik a királyságunkat).

Egyszerű játékmechanika, csupán 4 akció közül választhatunk 2-t a körünkben. Gyors szabályismertetés (kb 20 perc). Könnyű szabályrendszer. Sok konfrontációval, szinte észre se veszi már az ember annyi van (persze a játékosoktól is függ mert lehet békés verziót is játszani). Rövid játékidő (1-1,5 óra). 2-en is élvezetes játszani!

Hasonló érzésem volt mint ha egy logikai játékkal játszottam volna pl malom, vagy sakk. Szóval aki szereti az ilyen jellegű játékokat az nem fog csalódni. :shake:

I like T&E, but my biggest issue has been that the barrier to entry is really high. Because the mechanics are based on a largely abstract game design, it is very hard for people to catch onto the rules well enough to excel unless they play a few times, even if you're playing without monuments or other advanced rules.

If you can get a group together that can fight through those first couple games learning the rules and can deal with the relative lack of theme, then T&E can be a lot of fun. It is a brain-burner at times, so some AP-prone players may not be the best choices to play with.

T&E is better with 3-4 players, as a 2P game turns into 0-sum which typically devolves into each player building their own empires and then attempting one massive conflict near the game's end.

Great abstract civilization game. Lot of thinkwork. Very good game mechanics. Deserves the classic status. 

There may be a minor luck element in getting the tiles you need for your strategy. Or you could look at it from a different perspective and say that the tiles you draw determine your tactics in the short run, but you'll eventually win by clever strategic play and seeking for opportunities to gain the upper hand. For now i'm on the latter thinking side.

Still one of my favorite games. Good tile-laying, area control variant with a number of great balance mechanisms

Conflicts without dice. Deep. Rulebooks seems a bit lacking. Gorgeous components.

This is a true gem. I wish I had more opportunities to play this one. I like the way how you never know your exact position and might be surprised in the end to see that you have won.

Feels rules-heavy yet fairly lucky. On top of that, it's bone dry. I don't know, maybe it hasn't clicked, but right now the game seems okay at best.

If you keep things moving along, the system shows its brilliance. Breaking up empires dramatically is a lot of fun.

01/27/08 - This game tends to be pretty rough on noobz (I am a reasonably seasoned with it, although with today's play-and-dump gaming scene, that doesn't take much =[), and I have seen a lot of people struggle with it on the first few go-arounds.  Though I admire the game a great deal, I think it's tough for me to want to play it because the hurdles new players have to go through to begin enjoying themselves can be a little rough for me to witness. Of course, there is an outside chance it's me who is causing this....Anyway, I think my rating would jump if I had a dedicated group of live gamers who had a lot of experience with this game.

Previously -- One of a very select group of war-like euros, and arguably the best by a large degree (because it's a fact that Shogun/Wallenstein suxxx).  I try to stick to the 4 player game, since things tend to only get interesting once the board's real estate becomes scarce.  Starting conflicts between two opponents at the right moment is also tons of fun.

Overrated tile-laying game. Very abstract.

I concede that it requires a good deal of skill and has interesting mechanics, the trouble is that I just don't find the game *fun*.

Great thinker with good share of conflict which is exactly what my wife doesn't like about it, but will continue to play if I beg her to.

T&E has become one of my favorites.  It plays really well with all numbers of players.  There is a lot of room for good tactical decisions.  I like that you are only looking at the lowest collection of victory points.  That forces players to keep from getting too focused.

"Never sell or trade games shelf" This will never leave my top 10. Soooo many mechanics and strategy I love packed into this beauty. Highly recommended.

mint condition but missing one players set of wooden playing pieces, it was an open box buy at a local game store, when i tried to return it they said no returns on open box games, so my suspicion is someone bought it, it was missing the peices and the store just resold it

The best. Nothing can beat the feeling of planning internal conflict. Or external. Or monument. Or everything.

Very abstract. The concept of all players playing all colors seem to put some of my friends off balance. Good game though

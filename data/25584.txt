GAME: If Wishes Were Fishes!
RANK: 2043
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastic components (the worms are probably the best game component I've ever seen, and the cards are actually full-sized), excellent scalability (2-5 players), a light/fun accessible theme, and alot more depth/strategy than would appear at first glance makes for a very enjoyable game.

The goal is to get the most money (points), and there are several ways to accomplish this: 1)most worms at the end of the game, 2)fish sales to the market, 3)wishes granted by the fishes, 4)avoiding getting your fish dumped in the garbage, and 5)having the majority when a market closes.  You have 3 possibilities on your turn: 1)catch a fish and put it in your boat (however, boatspace is limited, and if you want cards deeper in the ocean, you have to use your worms to go get them), 2)catch fishes and release them, receiving a wish, and 3)sell fish to the market.  The card drafting works similar to Showmanager in that you can see what you want, but cards get more "expensive" (need more worms) if they are deeper in the ocean- of course you could always wait and hope they get to shallower waters, but that's a risk.  There's opportunity for screwjobs, as there is a very dirty wish granted by some of the fishes (putting fish in the dumpster), and players will often take cards you want, and/or fill markets before you.

This game is kind of what Zooloretto would be if that game had some actual meat on it.

What a great economics/area majority game. Meatier then the art and theme suggests. I held off on this due to the kid artwork. Now, it's one of my favs. Easy to teach, great bits (worms, fish-eeples, full size cards *woot*, big mondo meeple). Love the "worms for deeper cards" mechanic and the "trash heap game end before last closed market"  is really cool. Grossly under-rated. (wonder if theme and artwork may be a reason)

Good, short-ish, trading/market game. This was a pleasant surprise for me. The rubbery worms put me off, along with the cartoony graphics, but the gameplay is right up my alley. Light, but strategic, card-play with Euro elements. I even started to appreciate the worms as the game went on. Very, very, good for the bargain price I paid for it.

I'm somewhat taken by this game. Mainly around the fact that its unique in feel - unlike any other game I have. Its cute art belies a pretty deep and challenging game begging to be played again. I've house ruled the double-fish card now to make it like any other - usable not only with a wish as per the rules, but usable normally. Reduces fiddly rules just a touch making it easier to explain. I'm willing to play this several more times.

RATING: 6
It's a fairly nice family games.  At first the rules can be a a bit fishy for families.  It's not that it's hard but that all of the wishes and how they work can initially make people flounder a bit.  Essentially, it's drafting and hand management and a little space for being a worm towards your fellow players.  It has a slow start then gathers momentum.

RATING: N/A
The key to the game is to collect as many of one type of fish as possible and take advantage of cards that let you sell all your fish in one turn. Anyway, the presentation is outstanding and the basic idea very clever. The game made its debut at Los Angeles' Gamex convention.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice game with 4 to 5 players. You try to catch the right type of fish by investing bait. The price of fish goes up and down, depending on the amount of buyers. You can either catch a fish and hold on to it to convert it to cash or throw it back into the sea and get a wish. Wishes grant you special options (like obtaining an extra boat) and enhance your selling strategy. We were really surprised by this game. One of our best buys at Essen 2007.
Surprisingly, with 2 players it works well to.

RATING: 7.48
A clever little strategy game disguised in a somewhat childish theme.  The components are beautiful from the fisheeples to the purple squishy worms.  The board is nicely colored and decorated as well.  Gameplay is straight-forward and simple, but arguably lacks a bit of the control a seasoned gamer craves.  It's an excellent filler game.  I bought it on impulse and don't regret it.

RATING: 7
I am intrigued! Mostly easy to teach -- the icons in the wishes seem relatively straightforward. (Why, though, does the disperse meeples wish show $3 when the rules don't say anything about $3?) There were some complaints about there being no strategy, but I think those were off-base. Can't wait to play a few more times, thus the high rating.

RATING: 6.5
A silly theme packaged in a very nicely produced game.  While the game may appear silly, it is actually quite involved.  There is plenty of strategic positioning required to win the majorities, but this must be balanced against the luck of the fish draws.  The luck level / impact is well done in the game.  The light theme seems to help avoid any AP that could have emerged had the theme been more earthly.  The game fits into the meaty filler category.

OK, the worms are cool.  5 players felt too many as you cannot forward plan due to the changing cards.  Misses both boars for me - too many tactics for a party game, not enough control for a gamer's game.

RATING: 8
It seems to be a children's game because of all the colors and components, and even the concep (fish, sell, or wish with a fish), but as the game progresses, decisions get more and more difficult.  I like it quite a lot, and I think you may find a deeper game than expected.  Components are, in general, very good, but the icons in the whishes are not that good, they are not so self explanatory as should have been.

RATING: 7
The best way to describe it would be an almost card-counting tactical economic game.

Traded:  Not a bad game, it's just that there was always something better to play.

Good memories: Overall not a bad game to play, there were some tactics to explore, some waves to ride.  There's no overarching strategy with this one, and yet it's an economic game.

Bad memories:  Bar none, some of the worst language independent cards, and poorly explained at that, in the industry.  The symbols weren't really well defined, nor were there really good examples of how to use them.

Things I would change in this game:  I think they have the 'water' be at 4-5 cards.  I would actually make this 7-8 cards deep.  The reason being is that at 4 or 5, there's absolutely no chance of being able to plan ahead.  With 7-8 cards, you're kind of able to ascertain certain things about what's going on in the game and, forgive the pun...makes it deeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I really did not enjoy my first play of this game, and not just because I lost badly.  There's just something about it that makes me think you're supposed to plan ahead and yet things are completely different by the time the turn comes around to you, so you really can't plan ahead.  Every turn it just felt like catching a fish and selling it instantly was the optimum strategy because you never knew if you'd get more of the same fish on your next turn.  Perhaps if there were fewer players it would work more effectively, but with 4 or 5 it seems like a very poor game design.

I think a good novel would be where a bunch of men on a ship are looking for a whale. They look and look, but you know what? They never find him. And you know why they never find him? It doesn't say. The book leaves it up to you, the reader, to decide.

Then at the very end, there's a page you can lick, and it tastes like Kool-Aid.

Nice tactile element to the game (the worms) which is the best bit! Spend more effort to get cards you want from further along the available list (like Atlantic Star) add more boats to hold more fish and manipilate the markets by moving merchant meeples to boost your sales. Now I know the mechanism it might be worth another attempt...

Juego de pescar y vender peces y conseguir al final de la partida ser el que mas dinero ha conseguido. Es rápido y sencillito. El jugador en su turno puede pescar un pez (de un pool de cuatro cartas) y guardarlo en uno de sus barcos, vender pescado (a un precio variable que depende de la ubicación de varias fichas sobre el tablero) o usar el evento especial que acompaña a cada carta.

Es entretenido y sencillo. Muy apto y recomendable para no jugones. Tiene en realidad más chicha de la que parece a primera vista.

I like the layout of the board, and the art.. but everything still felt a bit too pasted on.  And the worms were an odd choice that blocks the text of the card you put them on.  I'd play it again, but I'm not in love.

Love this game - collect some fishes in your boat or boats and sell them in the market to earn as much money as possible. Lots of clever actions to help you out along the way as when you take a card you can keep the fish or use the action on the card. Good Game. 5 Plays.

RATING: 7
This is a trading game - buy low, sell high - with two currencies (worms & money) for buying and selling fish.  The multi-purpose cards either provide you with fish you can sell, or let you manipulate the market in some way.  You have to manage timing issues, such as when a market will close, whether it is worth the risk to sell fish to closed markets increasing your chances of paying a stiff penalty, etc.  Everything works well, fits together nicely.  But for some reason the game seems to lack excitement for me.  Maybe it's too easy to avoid the big penalties, or there aren't any drastic swings that change the board situation.  Maybe it's too hard to move the buyers and change market values, or too hard to block people from selling high.  

The production values are high, but a bit odd.  I don't really understand why they included the rubbery worms, but just had a scoring track for money.  The worms are cute, but they don't fit in with the rest of the pieces.  Also, my board doesn't fold flat.

RATING: 4
There were some really neat mechanics in this game - using your worms to get to other cards or getting points for them, hanging on to the fish to score it or throw it back in to use its power, etc. But all in all, I didn't really enjoy the flow of the game very much. And while I thought the production value was really great, it contributed to a 'kids game' feel. The thing is: I think I was in the mood for a kids game and I felt like I got bait and switched. It turned out to be a tactical brainburner.

Giant purple worms cover the cards, so you can't see them.  The iconagraphy is cryptic as well, making it hard to play with kids.  Not very functional.  Gameplay is pretty bland, although there are some decisions to be made.  Just didn't do much for me.  More painful with more players.

Let's look to the box... cute, colourful fish species and... yuck! What's there? Huge pile of slimy worms that have a look and touch like if they were alive! I can imagine the game designers in their planning phase: "Let's make something totally different. What about slimy worms?" Only smell is missing. Maybe it will be included in the next edition of game..? 

Game is very well-working although its name sounds stupid. Players gain money from selling their fish at the market and there are lots of interesting sales options to be made with the cards.

[10 plays] Nice game, well made, light and funny but strategic.  Has the "take the next thing or pay more to skip it" mechanism a la Vinci.  I especially love the swordfish art.  

Playable with 2p but not as good, because (1) it makes the game longer; it takes the same number of fish to fill stalls, but takes 2p more time to accumulate and sell that many fish; and (2) the whole worms dynamic becomes less interesting.

We made a mistake with the worms which really skewed the way the game developed, so I'd like to play this again properly. It seems a very tight game but it came down to obviously optimal moves based on who'd score what points. Like Portabello Market, games like that stop being games and start being mathematical exercises. I wasn't too keen on the graphics in IWWF, they made it harder for me to understand my options. The Kingfish was more king than fish. The worms however are just fantastic, they feel really weird and just just squishy enough. I'll probably rate this higher on my next go, but I'd like to play it with more than 3 players.

Played 1 time with 5 player. Well, I had high expectations for Pillars of the Earth, and was disappointed; I had low expectations for this game, and was pleasantly surprised; right now I rate both a 7! Simple mechanic (fish, wish, or sell a fish) reminds me a little bit of Heimlich & Co./Top Secret Spies, but with an economic layer. This might have been considered by gamers to be a great tactics game if it had been themed differently, but the fish theme and cartoony graphics look very kiddish, which is funny, because this is NOT a game for little kids. Solid family game though with older kids (9+).

I use this very game for our group to jumpstart our boardgames journey into euros genre, and it's perfect for that purpose, with a weight rating of 1.9 you can't find a better game than this. On top of that there is the colored fishes you probably won't find elsewhere which just pimps my meeples collection to another level.

Each turn you just have to decide whether to catch a fish and put it in a boat, sell a fish you caught in various turns, or catch a fish and use its wish instead of keeping it. But which choice to take to get optimal points is not obvious. The worms are also very cute :-)

RATING: 8
This is one of those games, that people want to play and after 10 minutes play time, they are like, "man, this is tough"!

Well, it's not easy, although it looks cute, because of the worms. This game is all about optimizing your income as you go through the cards (wishes) and using them properly. Will you let the fish go back in the water and grant you a wish, or will you catch it and get more money? The revenue changes constantly, you have to adjust your thinking as you go. It may be cute, but there's lots of calculation here. 

Once you get to know the game, it really shines. It's under appreciated, that's for sure. But it's a very good game and one that doesn't hit the table all that much. People just don't know about it.

A card drafting and area majority game that is actually deeper than it looks.  The production values are also great, the worms are awesome components and the artwork is quality.  

All that praise, this still didn't do much for me.  It felt a little lifeless.  Collect cards, place cubes, and score victory points.  Not much excitement, and some of the rules seemed overwrought for this type of game.

This is a lighter game, made for families or friends not wanting a heavy game.  Depending on the way the fish come out, your choices can be agonizing, very easy, or you can be forced to play cop and take the thing that is just too good for the next guy.

Really a Showmanager/Atlantic Star variant with the tough decisions taken out. Fun certainly, but highly tactical and opportunistic in nature mixed with the need to avoid leaving a good scoring card for the player to your right. You've just got to love the worms though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cute art and multiple paths to victory.  It might be a shade too long, but just a shade. Suitable for both gamers and nongamers (as long as you can explain the iconography). Some people in my group dismiss it as being for children because of the art.  This seems entirely unwarranted and makes me rather sad.

First played July 10th.  It takes about 10  minutes to be taught the game and perhaps 45 minutes to play for 5 players.  The rules seem a bit overwhelming, however they really aren't too bad once you've got them down.  You race to collect money by selling your fish and getting majorities in markets (and a few other ways).  It's on the lighter strategy side so it's a great game after a more complex/intense game.  It has a decent luck/strategy mix as well.  I'd recommend giving this a game play if you can manage to know someone who has it and give some consideration in purchase.

C'mon, this is a cool, quick game in a small package. I think it has a lot going for it.  It looks great, needs good decision making, one of those games where you can only do one thing, but really wish you could do 3.  Plays fast, a 2P game can be done in 30 mins.    Wrapping your head around the meaning of the wish cards can be a little confusing at first, but you learn them quick enough.
   Daughter gives it a 9, I give it 8.5.

RATING: 6
Despite all the 'cuteness' and great components there is a bit of a game in here and certainly more than first appears. 

A nice theme, a little strategy, some screwage, a few ways to score, some small decision making and about 45 minutes long. You can definitely plan some things and set yourself up for some big scores. A good light game that plays like a meaty filler but maybe runs just a tad too long for its weight. Rating could go to 7 with tweak or shorter gametime through more play. 

Note - The art and theme are a strange fit to the game itself as it appears to be a game for children when really it would be a little much for them. Could make a good family game but I think kids under ages 8 to 10 or so won't fare as well at the endgame. 

Tweak - Could be tweaked by making garbage limit 7 or 8 and removing one market card.

I first saw this game at the WBC in Jay's Cafe. I had surprisingly never heard of it and when I saw the purple worms, I just couldn't bring myself to play the game despite being an avid fisherman. Fast forward 7 months and I'm finally faced with playing it. And then I find out that it's not all that good, in fact it's pretty fun!  Sure, it's a mish-mash of other game mechanics but isn't everything anymore?  So while I won't be running out to buy the game, I won't balk at playing it again.

Rating after 1 play with 5 people.  Would like to play again.  Hated the fact that one of the people playing played at a glacial pace (their personal style for all games, not just this one).

Love the worms.  Not sure if I'll buy this game or not because it seems too complex for the family (who happy play Zooloretto, Ticket to Ride, etc.) and yet not really what our game group would want to play.

It may be perfect for our daily lunchtime gaming group though... I really like those worms.

I think I just didn't make much of an effort to get into the game.  The choices are interesting, and the game is definitely deeper than it appears, but it just didn't excite me very much.

Cute game with a very Euro feel and somewhat juvenile artwork. I like the sliding market. At every turn you've got three or four choices at least. There is tension over who will get the most in a certain fish type for the big points. We bring this out every once in a while at home but wouldn't bring it to game night because of the art.

RATING: 8
A game about catching fish and either keeping them to sale later, or releasing them and getting their wish. You try to sale enough of each type of fish to get majority bonuses.

The Good: Very nice components. Good rules. Good strategy. 

The Bad: Too complicated for a good gateway game. And perhaps too luck driven with the luck of the draw for the heavier strategy players. This luck is reduced to some extent by being able to choose between 3 cards.

The Ugly: This game looks cute - and therefore draws kids and new gamers. However, the game is a little too complicated for either group.

IGNORE THE ART - it's NOT just a kid's game!  There's a neat little card-drafting/-drawing mechanic that involves the spending of the worms to get the more recently-revealed cards, tough decisions about whether to use cards for their special power ("wishes") or for their VP value ("selling" them), market manipulation (the "buyers"), and even area-control scoring.  There are multiple paths to victory and several different strategies that you can try out.  Plus, the end result is still easy enough for pretty much anyone to understand.  I like it more the more I play!

Wonderful rubber worms and crawly things come with this game!  They basically are fun little game aids which you can pay to skip over cards to go fish in deeper water.  Basically, you are trying to sell your fish at the best price possible and end up with the most money.  On your turn you can either go fishing and collect a fish, sell one fish from your stock, or make a wish which basically means a special action as represented on one of the cards available.  Fun,lighthearted fare that also has an area majority twist in that whoever has sold the most fish of a certain type also gets extra points.  Spoilage can result in negative points.

Fun game but other people have it around me.  Sold in the Lydia charity auction.

It may be silly for me to think this but it is good in life to be silly once a while.  To ignore the raised eyebrow and arched comment when you grab the worms and make a wish on a fish that is wearing a bowler hat to move a guy from Carcasonne past a market stall.  If Wishes Were Fishes is a silly game, in a good way, a solid light game with sound mechanics, clear ideas and a manageble set of choices in each move it says being stable and just working is not enough I want to have fun.

The designers, it seems, have chosen to throw in the stuff they enjoy in boardgames and squeeze it all into a small box so when you open it bursts out.  It might take a few turns to work it out (the icons on the cards may cause confusion for the first few turns) and I challenge you to make sense of it from a single look at its parts, and kids artwork, but when you get it you cant help but smile.  If Wishes Were Fishes is not a classic, a brain burner or as history shows a game that revolutionised our community or even be top of your 'wish' list (pun intended) but if you get a chance to play it don't turn the opportunity down.  Its important to take out time to be silly.

Recommended for the not so serious game group who have a range of abilities.

Unusual game, somewhat interesting. The theme and rubber worms are a contrast to a game that's more serious and tense. Mechanically it's a medium light eurogame with low interaction and quiet play, but the box art and components suggest it something a 6 yo boy would love. (He'll like the worms but the game will be a bit confusing and dry for him.)  Best to not treat it too seriously and just have fun with it.

Aside from the great bits this game has some intriguing mechanics and hard choices. The fish theme and fun artwork could mislead one into thinking this is a kids game, but it is NOT. While I would say this is a family friendly or gateway game it is quite thought-provoking and strategic.

This is a clever game of fishing.  After you catch a few fish you have to sell them after you maneuver the price that they can sell for.  The gummy worms are kind of weird and turned a few of my friends off, but make no mistake, there is some strategy in this game to experience.

This is pleasant enough, though maybe too gentle and one dimensional to last many repeat plays at 40 minutes. It takes the Vinci drafting mechanism and adds tactical market driven buying and selling elements. It may find a niche with the family as the rules are easy, and with more players chaos will abound.

RATING: 7
This is a fairly simple card drafting game in which you can either draft a card as a fish (which you can sell for points later) or "throw it back" and use its special ability--allowing you to sell fish for more, get more space for fish, etc.  You can draft any card in the line, but if you don't take the first card, you have to put worms on all cards that are ahead of it; the person that finally takes that card will get the worms.  This game is beautifully produced (particularly the rubber worms), and has cutesy art that makes it look like a kids' game (it's not).  Overall, this is some good fun for a simple drafting game.

1 play so far, really enjoyed it. It can last a little long if people play the game too much. If you buy and sell fish lots then it will go quick. I think it's a case of get ahead and end the game.

Had a 5 player game now. Really adds to it. You can't plan anywhere near as much and the wishes start getting used alot more. I think the theme is a bit shaky but the game its self is worth the time.

Cool components and weird art- this game is a stock market game in disguise for kids and families. you are trying to run the fish stands and get the best payout for the fishes you own. For me this game dragged on too long and didn't have what I like. I didn't like the art but I know some do. The worms were adorable and gummy- who thought of that? Definitely a cool game for families and I would have enjoyed it growing up. There are lots of choices to be had- I just don't find it that interesting at this point in my gaming existence.

If ever there was a mismatch of style and content, If Wishes Were Fishes! is it! It looks like a kids game, with the bizarre artwork and rubbery worms, but it's actually a reasonably meaty card-drafting/market-manipulation game. I was really impressed by the way the mechanisms interlock, and I'm glad they went with a more distinctive look rather than pasting on another medieval trading theme.

Game is too long for what it is. Interesting, though not incredibly original, card drafting mechanism. I like the dual purpose cards, though people seem to be confused by the simple rule that you either get the fish or the wish. Even people who have played before can still fall into trying to do both. Perhaps it is the way the wishes are presented on the card... if there was a more clear separation between the two to make it more obvious it is an either/or choice. Rubber worms are a nice touch.

Cute, very euro-ish mechanics, collecting fish to sell or use the wish that the fish will grant if you free it.  Cute rubber worms are used as a sort of clever purchasing mechanism.  Nifty ideas, but perhaps I'm less into kitchen-sink game designs lately with so many diverse subsystems.

Good game with the single best game component ever.  The worms are awesome.  The game looks like it is built and geared toward children.  The box says 10 and up, however, I think the game is a little more difficult than what an average 10 year old could reasonably understand.

"I got worms. That's what we're gonna call it!" This game is definitely not what it seems. You will look at it and think, "kids," but you'd be wrong. While I think a ten-year-old would probably be able to handle it, it's really more of a gamer's game. The purple worms, that are the currency, provide a very satisfying tactile experience, which accompanies a very light/medium strategy game. It's awesome.

Mildly entertaining, but it doesn't rock my boat. Abstract with counting and trying to eek a few more points out of your fish than your opponents. It's okay as a game.

Drawn in by the theme

I found it quite easy to pick up and it can be played in around an hour. Loads of stragetic decisions on the way  regarding which cards to take (do you trade worms for a card further from the shore that you really need) or which cards to throw for wishes or sell to the markets.

SWISHY PURPLE WORMS!!!  The worms and the interesting artwork make the game.  It comes with a set of cards with the typical non-language hieroglyphic symbols but even those weren't too bad.  Players sell fish at a market, and the meeples are used as fish critics.  It would be a good game for parents to play with their kids.  It's a quick easy game with some strategy.

Man, this is the decade of drafting.  It seems everyone is doing it these days.

As usual, there are some cards that do stuff, you pick what suits you best and hope that you score well.  

Good luck.

Not bad, better than many games out there, but nothing outstanding or new (ahem... Vinci).  Most of your options seemed pretty clear, but there were a few minor decisions to make.  Certainly not a nail biter.  Placid.

I'd like this game less if it weren't for the theme. Mechanically, there are a few different things going on--card drafting, market manipulation, area majority--and all of it works together rather well. There's a respectable amount of depth for the short playtime, and it's deceptively vicious near the end. There's probably a bit too much luck in the card draw, but that could be fixed easily enough with a house rule.

The first 30 minutes was fun.  Then the fun level started dropping. This was a 5-player game, and it took 90 minutes.  By the end, we had pretty much done everything we could do - 9 fish in the garbage, most open shops had 6 fish.. it was going on and on and on.

An odd game in the sense that it looks like it's aimed for children yet is too complicated.  As a result, it may get overlooked by adults and that's too bad, because it's a fun economic, hand management game with great components, especially those rubbery worms!  I was quite surprised how fun it is given my lower expectations.  The rule where you can either catch the fish or instead choose the wish is quite clever.

Fun--a pleasant take on area majority with a number of different ways to effect change.  If there's enough different in the game to make it come to the table, is another question well worth asking.  The game has hand-management, area-control, and a sort of role-selection in a broad sense, but doesn't really combine them in a new fashion.  So what we've found is that the game is good, and well worth playing, but you might find, as we have, that it plays itself out relatively quickly and ends up sitting on the shelf for inordinately long stretches of time. 

Pick it up in a trade or cheap auction, play it out, then pass it on.

A very visually attractive game with wonderful tactile purple worms and humerous card art.  The rules are quick and simple to explain, but the cards take a bit of learning for the first time player.  
What seems at first glance to be a kiddies game is, in fact a comparitively deep and interesting economic game which gamers find worthwhile to play together.  I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad one.  The light and fluffy look puts off some gamers and the slightly deeper game play and card learning makes it more difficult than non-gamers expect before they try it.  However, it appeals to all the family and is a very good entry game because of this.

RATING: 6
Prefer 3-player, but 4 is not that much worse.  light card game that was challenging enough to be engaging, but not too taxing on the brain. Players are fishermen trying to catch valuable fish and sell them for good money at the corresponding fish stall. Or the fisherman can catch a fish and throw it back and use its wish (which provide another boat, manipulate the market price of the various fish, etc.). If a fisherman catches a fish in deeper water, he must place a worm on each of the fish in shallower water. Any worms on a fish card that is caught become the property of the fisherman, but fortunately the worms never get digested. Once a set number of fish are in a market stall, a scoring takes place in that stall. Then, the next stall to get filled, another scoring takes place. Up to 4 of the fish stall will end up being scored, unless the garbage dump gets filled with 10 fish. (Once a market stall is filled and scored, and additional fish sold are placed in the garbage dump.) The game supports 2-5 and is a quick 45 minute game. This is probably a very strong game for families as it is simple, not taxing and does not have to be too viciously played, although we did play the game a bit on the nasty side. Highly recommended.

I'm having problems classifying exactly where this game fits.  It feels like a family game at first glance.  But then when you dig a little deeper there are some interesting mechanisms going on that give you the idea it might be a good game for gamers as well.  Ultimately, I think it's got some randomness/luck issues; if the right cards come out at the right time, it can really help someone out.

Every turn you either sell fish, or draw a card which you can either keep as catch, or let go in exchange for its wish.  The wishes do cool things like let you sell fish, transform one fish type into another, move the buyers at the market, etc.  If you want a more recent card you have to pay a worm to every card you jump over, and those worms go to the people who take the less desirable cards.  

When you sell at the market, you get bonuses for the different buyers at the fish stall you're selling to (each stall only buys one type of fish).  Money is victory points.  And there are stall limits, so once any stall passes the current limit you divvy up some bonus points according to who sold the most fish at that market.  Te market closes and the next market limit card is revealed.  At game end, there is a bonus for most worms.

There's something here... but it was just a little too random for me. I might play it with my family.

RATING: 6
Got this because from Vasel's video review the mechanisms seemed simple and slick yet interesting, having an action market, short vs. longer term strategy, and area majority.

...Finally played this. It's a fun game but not without problems. The market mechanism, which is currently very popular with me, seems to too frequently offer stuff you don't want. If you don't have fish, you probably want to get a fish, and it feels wasteful to take a wish that allows selling fish if you haven't got any. Also as markets close throughout the game, entire types of fish become dangerous to sell because they will go to the trash pile which can penalize you at game end. I also question the use of getting additional boats...

I'm not sure how much long term planning is possible, in contrast to what I was thinking this game had. You may buy a fish with a certain estimate of its value, but you don't know that a card allowing value manipulation won't show up and be bought by someone before your next turn. "Long-term planning" seems to resemble gambling.

Also the area majority in this game doesn't feel as competitive/interactive as such games usually do, due to one's "placement" options usually being limited. I feel the area majority a bit when you get the option to "spoil" a fish someone has already sold.

The possibility of ending the game via a full trash pile causes some nasty "I don't want to do anything" situations. If selling a certain type of fish will put it in the trash pile and end the game, and I'm not currently in the lead, then not only do I not want to sell that fish, I also probably don't want to even obtain it, as many wishes force you to sell if possible.

There's also the kingmaker problem, where if I'm decidedly losing, the move that maximizes my score could end the game in somebody's favor. To me it's an iffy practice to willfully end the game if I'm not going to be the winner. I don't normally have a grudge against kingmaker issues, but in this game it bothers me because it's not a negotiation game or one where alliances or cooperation make much sense.

A few rules questions. One type of card mentions a $3 payout which isn't in the rules. Unclear whether I can use a "spoilage" card on myself, or if I'm perhaps confused in thinking spoilage can be desirable. And lastly I'm unsure when exactly you are allowed to exchange a fish (previously obtained) for its wish. It sounds like it's meant to be a free action. I assume it has to at least be your turn, but the rules don't say.

I am thinking that "market" games are more interesting as the "effects" being sold affect other players more. (Thinking mainly of Eight-Minute Empire in contrast to this game.)

I picked this game up because of the cute components, and found out there's quite a devilish game inside, despite it looking like a kids game with the artwork and faux worms. Which fish do I buy, do I spend my precious worms to do so, fights for majority in the various markets, struggling to get the buyers to the correct markets at the right time to maximize your sales, deciding to use a card for the fish or for the wish, there's a lot of game in here.

(After one 4p game)  We got this to the table at the end of a game night and were being shuffled out of the FLGS soon, so we played our "Speed Fish" variant - encouraging very quick game play.  After a few cards were taken by each of us - we go the idea and saw the possibilities. I could see how this game might drag out with in-depth analysis of optimal game play and trying to fill as many fish markets as possible, but with "speed fish" that was not an option.  I won using a "worm accumulation" strategy and capitalized on at least 4 or 5 worm scoring cards.  It also helped that we burned through the market cards rather quickly - I triggered the end game.  Cute idea (maybe too cute for adults?)- not a young kids game.

I love the worms...gummy worms. Love the artworks, and the mechanic is easy and really friendly for newbie players but also gives challenges to moderate players.

cute, not bad but not great. i feel like i've seen this game in many other games which makes sense since it came out a while ago.

Enjoyable! Not sure how many real decisions there are, but I liked the different things going on..

This is one extraordinarily weird game, made even more so by the totally wacked-out theme (why would any fish wish to be sold at a fish market?).  It has a mechanism similar to R-Eco or Traders of Carthage, where you're taking cards into hand that will act differently from the cards that you "buy."  Unfortunately, there's not a lot of control in the way that the cards come out.  It's a little frustrating to get a selection of crappy cards on your turn, but then when the new card comes up, it's exactly what the next player needs.  I suppose the luck evens out the situations like that, but I can't see myself playing the game too often.

Additionally, I can't see ever playing the game with more than 3 players, since there are only ever 3 cards face-up to choose from.  At least there's some semblance of control, in that if you see three cards face-up, you know you'll get one of them, and can try to plan your play around it.  Whether or not the other two players will allow you to do it, though, is another story.

Although the game looks very cartoony (especially with the purple rubber worms), there is a deep strategy game here.

Amusing for what it is. Market-based game with some worker placement and decision-making. Cute little board and components, but nothing to write home about.

This game has squishy rubber worms, and it [i]still[/i] isn't much fun.

Yet another game sporting the "which cheap cards are available on my turn?" flaw.

Interesting price manipulation game. Very nice worm bits.

Played once (with 4 players). A strange game with some really weird components (the worms, unfortunately, are not easy to place on a card without hiding some part of the information on it). As for the game itself, it is enjoyable and has some choices, but some lack of control makes it a bit too long for what it is (maybe that would be better with 3 players - I doubt it has enough interaction on the majorities with only 2). Also, the rules are a bit imprecise and some elements are missing.

Silly fun theme but with a decent game underneath. And we all love the wiggly worms.

A game with similar mechanics to Firenze with a more tactical feel and forgiving scoring mechanism. Also the theme is more engaging in my opinion. Even my cat likes to play with the plastic worms. Worth trying if the current price of Firenze is putting you off but you are interested in the mechanics.

If wishes were fishes then I would go out, catch myself a fish and then wish that I'd never bought this game.
The components are pretty swell though, and while it gets a bad rap around my place it aint as bad as that first sentence made it seem.
After 6 plays I've finally changed my mind about this game, and while I wouldn't knock over any buildings to get to it - I do think it's a solid little entry.

Interesting mechanisms, and good decisions to make, but with five players, there's a certain degree of feeling at the mercy of the cards.  Plus, acquiring extra boats seems even more frivolous than third fields usually are in Bohnanza.  Very fun components, though!

After 1 Play: I've waited too long to rate this game, and I'm having trouble remembering specific mechanics at this point.  I do remember an overwhelming feeling of "meh" to the game as a whole.  Then again I did play with only 2 players, so that may have colored my opinion.

Excellent game with a silly theme but robust tactics. The bits are great. Recommended for a family with older kids or light strategy (family weight) fans.

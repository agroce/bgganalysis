Always loved this one, so much so that I now have a full tabletop version, with proper toy cars that I take to convention, (this can take 6 players). After all these years, it's still a big hit with the crowds. The origional board size is visually unexciting due to its small size (hence the upsize). Better than Car Wars in my opinion.

north-east UK regional champion.  Got totally wiped in the national final at gamesday '86.  Yeah, 86 sounds right...  Gonna have to dig out the trophy to check...

The basic retail game suffered from having a small playing board.  The games worshop championship boards were fantastic.  Made the game really shine.  Should be rereleased with better and more expansive board layout.  This game is fantastic when played on a better playing field than the, to be honest, pathetic offering in the basic game box.

RATING: 4
Ultimately, although I have had some good times playing this, the game is too clunky and unbalanced (one car is vastly superior to the others). Also, the little red damage counters seem to have a life of their own and refuse to stay put.

Unfortunately on 26-11-2009, BGG were instructed to remove all uploaded files all all GW games. Even those files with no copyrite material.

The games might be OK but the company attitude to it's customers is definitely broken. All my GW game ratings are reduced to '1's until GW mend their piss poor attitude to their client base and files are allowed to be reinstated..

Good theme but rules are stuck in between quick & fun and RPG-realism. Needs larger game board and more options in general.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While it has rules ambiguities and probably is not deadly enough (ie cars can take too many hits which slows game) it has consistently been more fun for me than Car Wars which appealed a lot but played like watching paint dry. This game shows GWs strengths/approach - derivative design, fantastic components for the 80s, play-aids that improve playability as well as looking good.

Simple, straightforward fun. My grade is certainly not unbiased, as I have very dear memories of this game from my early teens; I know the game as Combat Cars.

Sold this a few years back. Almost regret it. It's adecent game. Had lots of fun with it during my teenage years. But it felt a little 80'-ish and I realised that a) I hadn't played it for over 10 years and b) it would probably be worth a fat wad of cash. So gree took the better of me and I sold it.

RATING: 5
The theme really appeals to me but the gameplay is marginal.  I had lots of fun with this in my early teens.  It might make a good framework for a simple miniature auto car duel game.

It is a good idea to randomize turn order - just makes the game a bit better imo.

Ah, the memories! At the game club, we had three copies of this game combined for one huge never ending game.
A bit fiddly with all the chits for ammo and damage. Perhaps a bit unbalanced, with some of the weapons being slightly better than others.
But still very fun.
Heh, a surprising amount of the coments for this game are by Swedes (30 out of 89!). I guess the Swedish version "Combat Cars" was a huge hit back in the day =P

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Dead simple game which largely comes down to the roll of the die.  Would probably ordinarily give a game like this probably about a 5 or 6 but it gets a bonus for the pure adrenalin rush of trying to squish your opponent who is making a run from the smashed wreckage of his car for the (temporary) safety of a building, or using your very last weapon in the arsenal to attempt to hit someone's damaged fuel tank with a flame thrower (hardly ever works, but when it does whoops of laughter abound and you are allowed to do a victory dance).

This was one of the very first boardgames I ever owned and will always hold a sentimental spot for me.  Definitiely not a 'Euro' game.  Definitely an old favourite.  I you love to smash 'em crash 'em mash 'em and you like to pretend you're Mad Max you will love this.

A load of fun.

Own the swedish translation, Combat Cars. I still find it funny that they (the company Äventyrspel) did translate the game and change the name of the game, from Battle Cars to ... Combat Cars. Why? It's still a English name!
Another fun thing about the Swedish version is that in the scenarios in the rules booklet, you'll find a lot camo apperancances of (sort of) well know Swedish members in the Society for Cretive Anachronism!

Fun old school Games Workshop light version of Car Wars. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
What was once a great game is now a little frayed around the edges.  What is good about this game is improved upon by and simplified by Wreckage.  There is a ton of fun stuff here, but obviously Games Workshop didn't discover turn order technology.  The first player has a huge advantage and the first player never changes.  When I play again it will have to be based on whoever is going fastest (ala Wreckage).  Regardless the game is fun, sure the turret is too weak and the one turn per movement annoying, but worth busting out if you have 6-8 people wanting to play a car bashing game.  A shame the board and cars were so small.

An old games workshop game from the dawn of my game playing. I bought this instead of car wars and I don't regret it. Lacks car wars diversity.

Not too difficult, hasn't aged too well rules are fairly easy to understand.

My version has had a lot of items made to replace aging parts. Foamcore buildings and obstacles new vehicle damage records that you can use OHP pens on.

old school GW's answer to carwars

much simpler than teh original SJG  granddaddy

lack of avaliable space in weapon pods means that generally without a definative scenario this will come down to continued ramming

visually the vehicle play sheets are much more intresting than carwar's lil pictures its nice to have to remove ammo that is spent rathr than makeing a hash mark

damage works well and for a car combat game fairly simple

worth buying ifn you see a second hand copy

RATING: 10
An absolute classic. Cars bristling with Rockets, Machine Guns, Flamethrowers, Oil Slicks, Smoke Screens, Mines and Spikes duel it out in a post apocalyptic arena.

Vehicle demolition and carnage taken to the extreme. Has almost perfect damage, handling and speed physics.

Miniatures increase playability no end.

Gameplay is very clunky, but for its age what do you expect????? Still the best in its genre after 20  years.

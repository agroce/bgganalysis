Played once, and lost miserably. My reaction times are definitely not up to scratch! Some players had difficulty correctly identifying the animals (especially the colourblind) as each card is different, and others were tripped up by the cow.

I expect this would be a fabulous drinking game!

Zany little dexterity game from the creator of Cheating Moth and Cockroach Poker. Has a verbal element in addition to slapping down on the table, and a theme that couldn't be much sillier. Good in situations where you want a quick 'party' game but only have five or less players.

Not my style of game, but I had some fun.  Much nicer than Jungle Speed, and crazier.  The mix of sound, movement and visual aspect make it quite nice.  Cards are also really cool.

Another one of these very light, small box DMS games. I still think Cockroach Poker is the best in the range however. This one is fun but is hampered because, like many dex games (though no dexterity required for this Tango) it significantly, even harshly exposes the differences in ability round the table - not really one to play with a mixed age group of kids.

However, as a game to play with a group of similar abilities (say a bunch of slightly drunk gamers) it is a great laugh and lots of fun.

Along the lines of cockroach / vegetable soup.  High confusion level (which is the goal of this game, so it's a good thing!), and the additional rules really turn this into a mind twister.   

We were all so confused (some more than others) that it never really went around more than a time or two, so I suspect it would take quite some time for people to get used to this one.

This game is way worse than Kakerlaken Salat (or Suppe, which is almost the same game), both of which I highly recommend. It just wasn't any fun, except for the tarantula cards. I will always play the other games before this one, so I doubt it will ever be played again.

Hectic and funny, just like Kakerlakensalat or Geistesblitz. This one has many rules that can be incorporated (optionally) but make the game much more difficult, so I wouln't recommend using them (all).

Light filler, fun, yet challenging once the full stack of rules has been introduced. Played for almost an hour with a group of sober but fun-loving singers. House-ruling it so that we had to to keep time with whatever's on the jukebox increased the challenge further.

Speed game in a similar vein to Kakerlakensalat, a little less mentally taxing in its basic form but with an added spatial component that soon becomes the major source of errors when the advanced rules are in effect.

On the surface, this feels like a children's game, what with the animal noises and such. That said, I've played with groups of PhD students who barely succeded once the advanced rules started to be added. Very fun with the right, out-going (see: animal noises) crowd.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2013)

Fun light game. This is awfully close to Snorta in mechanics and theme, but I like it (I still prefer Snorta). This is ideal to play with non-gamers and family (I want to buy it). I guess the rating could go up as the only time I played it, it was 2:00 AM and I was hammered.

The playtime is pretty short, the art is adequate as is the component quality. I don’t have any particular complaint about this game. 

I hope to play it soon again.

After more plays, I continue to enjoy Tarantel Tango, in fact it is a good game for me and I’m upgrading its rating. Great game for gamers and non-gamers alike. Also it is another Zeimet game I enjoy and I will buy in the future. The only negative for me are the unusual cards size, I have had trouble finding the correct sleeves for them.

One of 2009´s favorites.

I enjoy this entire series of games, though I still consider Kakerlakensuppe to be the best.

This one is similar, but adds in a card placement requirement which can add another layer of difficulty.  The animal noises are fun, but it should be noted that some of the animals are hard to tell apart.  I don't have trouble telling them apart, but others did - you have to admit that the goats and donkeys do look somewhat similar.

It would probably be good to introduce the "experienced player" rules slowly.  We tried playing with all four in our first game and we rarely made it around the table more than two or three times before someone messed up.  This made the game a little longer than I'd like.  I'm sure once we figured it out we'd do fine.

A simple (but not bad) reaction game, in which you need to shout different animal sounds. Should be interesting to watch too.

Paprastas (bet ne prastas) reakcijos žaidimas, kur reikia rėkauti visokius gyvūnų garsus. Turėtų gerai skambėti iš šono.

This is a game I love to show to people just because of how silly it is. It's gotten mixed results from these people, but they all appreciate it even if it isn't something they want to play again. My sillier friends love it. For others the verbal repetition of animal sounds is a bit too much for them sober.

Recently, I've started introducing this game to people as "Mao Mamba." Mao https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game) is a well known game with a cool rules-adding element but a base set of rules that simply isn't very fun. The core idea of Mao is that players have to struggle to figure out the rules (no rules explanation is given - players are punished whenever they "break a rule"), but once players figure out the rules  play becomes tedious. 

In "Mao Mamba," you add the fun aspects of Mao to an already strong and entertaining base game. New players do not receive a rules explanation, the player(s) that are familiar with the rules call others out whenever they unwittingly break a rule, and the winning player makes up a new secret rule that is added for the next round of the game. I encourage you all to try this out. :)

This might be the best of the "Kakerlaken" family. Spatial placement adds some fun and while confusing, it's less perplexing than Kakerlaken Salat (which might be because I confuse the words for salad and cauliflower in real life).
Requires a house rule to allow to throw some cards during the game (when there's really all five columns of cards, the collecting player might choose one to throw off the game, still collecting the remaining four into his hand), or it's potentionally endless. Lots of laughs, though.

Tarantel Tango is a simple, 15-20 minute cardgame. The entire 120 card deck is dealt out evenly, players draw cards one at a time and play them to the centre of the table. Players race to play all their cards first. Cards have cute animal cartoons, and players must make the correct animal sounds when playing cards, or else they pick-up the pot and the game restarts. Cards are not played in a single pile, but in a circle around a central rondel. Certain cards change the direction of play, while the Tarantula cards prompt all players to knock on the table: slowest player collects the pot.
The game is clearly aimed at kids, or adults equipped with appropriate beverages. Sadly, we played it sober... nevertheless, it is a pretty good game within its limits. The cards are a bit flimsy, but the illustrations are quirky and clever.

RATING: 7
A silly, fun little speed/recognition game. 

Each player has a face down stack of cards. On your turn, flip the top card and place it in the appropriate place around the tarantula in the center; but if the previously played piece has any spiders on it, make the appropriate noise (matching the previous animal card) first, as many times as there were spiders on that card. The "appropriate place" is usually 1 or 2 (the number of animals pictured on the card) spaces away from the previous card in the current direction (initially, clockwise) of movement. If you make an error, add all played cards to your pile then continue play. Some animals modify these rules:
- donkey: "stubborn" -- play on top of it
- dog: chases its tail; change direction
- parrot: imitates the sound of the last animal (if any)
- tarantula: players smack the table to scare it away; last player to do so collects the cards.

The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!

We played with the expert rules and it was quite the challenge!  I got the hang of it better late in the game.  I like these types of games quite a bit.  This one is rated a bit lower because of my difficulty in distinguishing some of the animals, especially when they're upside down.

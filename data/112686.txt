Best with around 3 players.

This game can be fun. If played light and fast, and everyone gets a chance to get a few good licks in, it can be a blast. On the other hand, playing this game is one of the few times I really lost my cool after getting beat up on and losing every single round against my two opponents.

This one can get under your skin.

I enjoy this game even though I have never won it.  I feel like the sweet spot for this game is 4 players.  Incredibly random on the effects of spells sometimes and easy to die in higher player count game.  First time we played was with 6 and 4 died in the first round.  Can be incredibly quick or drag out for about an hour.  All depends on the luck of the draw.

Epic Spell Wars is an entertaining filler game which can provide brief bursts of fun as long as you can overlook its shallow gameplay and lack of need for any significant strategic thought.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A great quasi-filler for the right crowd.  Crazy (and excellent) Adult Swim-style artwork is icing on the cake for this funny, quick hand management game.  You all play combinations of up to three cards to make spells, which can have all sorts of crazy effects, usually at least including zapping your rivals.  There are elements of bluffing and hidden selection, although unless someone is low enough on health to potentially die, the initiative mechanism doesn't make a *huge* difference.  When playing with more than two players, all your cards have pre-determined targets (i.e. "the player on your left"), which helps prevent the leader-smashing and ganging up in waves that plagues Munchkin and other "gotcha" games.

I like this a lot more than I was expecting.  It will probably get old in a few dozen plays, but for now it's a ton of silly fun.  Games with more players can run longer, since you need to win two rounds to win the game, but you can modify the victory conditions or starting health or something to shorten it.

Incidentally, I stuck all the spell cards in some extra Ultra Pro sleeves I had left over from ANR.  They fit really snugly, it's quite nice.

RATING: 2
I was killed in the very first spell before I even got to play mine, in my very first game. I then proceeded to sit for 20 minutes while waiting for everyone else to die so I could join the next round. Any redeeming qualities of this game are ruined by the fact that you can die within the first 60 seconds without even playing, and then have to wait a long time to play again.

This is the biggest waste of time I've ever had the misfortune of playing.  I will choose to do anything else rather than suffer this again.  Rectal surgery is more appealing.

The downtime is rediculous if you get knocked out early.  10-15 minutes sat waiting to be able to come back again and a high chance you will be knocked out again before even getting to play your cards.

I lost a good hour and half at my weekly game night effectively watching other people playing real games that were actually fun until a new game started that I could join.

Simple. Stupid. And EXTREMELY fun. Try and imagine if violent Adult Swim cartoons like Superjail and Korgoth the Barbarian (I know that one only got a pilot) had a totally excellent and metal baby card game, in which you matched up different component spell cards to form things to blast your enemies. It's more or less like the Brutal Legend version of Magic the Gathering, if that makes any sense, and it's hilarious...sometimes you have to just shut down your brain and enjoy a game, and this is one of those times.

The name and art set very low expectations for me, so I was actually surprised when there ended up being more game here than I expected.  As far as gameplay goes, I could rate this a 5 ("I'll probably find it better than not playing a game."), but the utter juvenility of said name and art drops the game to a 3 ("I'll actively lobby to play something else instead.") for me.

RATING: 6
A fantasy-themed take-that game, with the main twist being that the spells are assembled from three parts shuffled into the deck that player assemble together. Rounds go quick enough, a good trait for a take-that game, but at higher player count it could drag, as to win one needs to win two rounds, which is problem since this game encourages bash-the-leader. Also, the rule book looks awful and a pain to read.

Looking forward to playing this, absolutely love the art and humor, but I REALLY hope this plays in 1 hour or less considering the amount of random craziness.  It looks like the suggested playing time is for one round, which may be enough, but it seems like 2-3 rounds will be standard for more than 2 players.

Cool looking, great and hilarious art, but the game just isn't that great and takes a bit too long.  Sold

A take-that game with hilarious texts and graphics. Unfortunately they wear thin very fast. In our 6-player game it was possible that you were out before you can even act once. In addition, reading all the texts on the cards and watch others playing them, drags too long for this type of game.
There are better alternatives in this genre, e.g. 'Plague & Pestilence' or 'Red Dragon Inn'.

Great art but very random gameplay. You can design your own spell but the effects are very similar. Stronger spells are executed later, and that's the only way you can influence the outcome. The game can drag on and that gets boring if all you do is adding and removing damage tokens randomly.

I adore the epic over-the-top theme; it's a preteen boy's id cranked up to ELEVENTY BILLION!!!!!! as the most bad-ass wizards in the land compete for the grandest prize of all: the sweet release of death.

Unfortunately, the gameplay falls a tad flat for me. It's too slow to be a filler game, and too chaotic and random to be satisfying as a strategy game. Victory is largely a matter of drawing the right cards and rolling well.

Still, it has its lively and graphically absurd charms. Not one I'd seek out for myself, but if a friend brought it to the table, not something I'd try to talk her out of.

Pro's:

1) Great cartoony artwork, stylish and violent.
2) Personally I find the game lots of fun to play. If you have a group that's really willing to do the voices and run the full gamut of ridiculousness that the game encourages it is one of the best experiences of that type.
3) Stupidly easy to learn.
4) One of the best drunk games.

Con's:

1) You do need to be with a group of friends you are comfortable with.
2) It isn't an all nighter game, you will grow tired of it faster than the rules will declare a winner.

a cute card game in which create 3-part spells to cast upon opposing players. Nice art and some light strategic choices (balancing who to attack with when to attack and trying to manage hand for future draws). Part of fun is artwork and novelty of choices. May not be highly replayable.

A hilarious game. Be prepared for the game to take 1-2 hours with a group of 4-6 players. While having more people is a hell of a lot of fun with the randomness of the spells, having a number closer to four makes the time of the game more reasonable.

I think any group that plays this with some consistency will get used to the spell effects and will be able to make it through each round in just a couple of minutes.

Absolutely hysterical game. Love the art, love the flavor.

The artwork in this game really gives the game the oomph it so sorely needs. It's an entertaining little filler, with all sorts of spiteful things to do. Just not an awful lot of depth to it.

That being said, it is very good at what it does, even with two players. It's just too much fun to look at.

Oddly enough, two players may be it's strong point. More players slows down the game exponentially and really hurts it's filler game power.

RATING: 4
Some pretty major issues here. First is that the rule book is very hard to understand and the layout makes looking up rules a chore. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that there are a lot of ambiguously worded card effects that need to be looked up regularly.

Player elimination was a clear problem. Ex: In a three player game, players 1 and 2 die that round and player 3 is left with five health. The next round, players 1 and 2 go back to full health (20) and player 3 stays at five health. Player 3 is going to die roughly in the first 1/4 of the round and will be waiting for the other players to kill each other before he plays again. But at least when you die you get to discard your hand and draw a new one. Problem is that is the ONLY way to get rid of your hand, which leads me to my next problem...

Because you can only play one of the three card types (start, middle, end) each turn, you can easily end up with too many of the same card type which clogs up your hand, greatly reducing the amount of decisions you have on a turn. Ex: I had randomly drawn four end cards in my first hand. Since I could only play one per turn, it would take me at least four turns to play them all. I played three cards the first turn, one of them being an end card which put me down to three end cards. Then when I drew back up to the hand limit of eight, I drew two more end cards, so now I'm at five! At this point it starts to feel like it's hindering my options per turn. I say aloud to the table that I have 5 end cards and someone else says they have too many also. A third player adds that he has too many middle cards. A bad shuffle? Perhaps but I doubt that would save this game for me. They try to mitigate the random draw with the Wild Magic cards which can be played in place of any of the card types but there doesn't seem to be enough of them in the deck to make any difference.

I should add that the game did provide some interesting card combo's and I can see the market it's trying to hit. I don't mind the gory art but it comes off as trying too hard and so it gets a little tiresome by the end of the game. Overall the game just has too many ambiguous rules and mechanical problems for me to ever care to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Not bad, but I wasn't a huge fan of this game. The base mechanic of constructing spells isn't bad, and I like the way they implemented initiative. There was also a good variety of cards, and I liked the Dead Wizard mechanic that keeps you slightly invested even after dying, and may even spur you to try and die earlier if you know you aren't going to win.

That said, there certainly is no 'long term' strategy per se, and luck plays a bigger part than I normally like. It's also hugely tilted to "catch the leader", another mechanic I like normally only in smaller doses. Lastly, we played with 4 people and it didn't seem like anyone was particularly slow, and it still almost took 2 hours: too long for a game like this with no real juicy strategy choices to ponder over and no real planning to do.

Edit: Another play, another 2 hour game. Bumping down to a 5 and I still kind of feel like that's generous.

Edit 2: Haven't replayed since then, but whenever I think of this game, I think that I hate it (or at least definitely don't like it). No desire to ever play again. Bumping to a 4, more to try to 'spread out' my ratings then anything else.

Edit 3: Trying to align my scores with the bgg ratings guide. In that case this is a 3. Already turned down an invite to play this again, would be hard pressed to ever think I will.

   I like the creativity & humour that goes in to card selection on your turn, but I do not appreciate the artwork.  Also, I think more effort should have gone in to balancing the game (with regards to the amount of damage delivered in a game with 4+ players).

The real appeal here is the cool art and wacky theme, which actually makes the first game sort of fun as you laugh at the wackiness.

However, the game play once you get over the humor doesn't make it something that I'd ever be all that excited to play again.  Basically, you pick some cards from your hand to create spells which can be composed of three parts to form a spell with some sort of crazy name with crazy effects.  Then, everyone plays out their spells, which will generally damage opponents or heal the player who cast the spell.

Play until there is only one player still standing, who wins the round.  First player to win two rounds wins.

If you like take-that games with a little bit of decision making to them, you'll probably really like this one.  For me, it was a bit too much take-that without enough decisions involved to feel like I was really making clever plays to make the take-that part rewarding.

This rating is also for play with 3 or 4 players.  Any more, and the game would totally overstay it's welcome.  I would avoid this game in a 5 or 6 player scenario.

A silly game of building a hand of 3 cards that try to kill your fellow wizards. The game is over the top as the cards are overpowered and requires a little personality injected by the players to make the game fun. Typically it only takes 3 rounds for a game to end and first to win 3 games is declared the overall winner. I'd play with the right group but not one I'd ever own.

Absolutely crazy little push-yer-luck game. I like it, and think the 'killed early' balancing mechanics are a nice feature - but the characters could each do with their own little ability to spice things up a little and proffer a little creativity in drawing tactical strengths around an individual factor.

I know this is meant to be light and silly fun, and the illustrations are excellent but this is another game in the American old-school design style of random, take-that games that have very little in the way of actual play.

Players have a hand of 8 cards that they use to construct spells to damage the table. The spells are 1 of 3 parts (beginning, middle, end) and they come in a variety of suits. The suit matters because many of the spells have dice rolls associated with them where rolling 10+ is very desirable. The trick is that you only get 1 die base, and then 1 additional die for each part of the spell that matches that card's type. In essence, this means that you want to have 3 part spells all of the same suit to maximize your chances to roll high dice, and you have no real control over that.

Similarly out of control is your ability to target particular people (much of the time: the cards will dictate left, right, or foe with the most HP for you) or your ability to mitigate damage (as there are very few healing spells).

Each round continues until only 1 person is standing. The people who had been eliminated receive consolation dead cards that can help them next time around, but then everything continues again for another round and does so until the same person wins twice. In other words, the bigger group size is very bad, as it would make this game potentially continue on forever. The 30 minutes listed on the page is insanely generous, the only way the game is that fast is if the same person wins 2 rounds in a row, as each round takes at least 10-15 minutes.

Anyway, not my kind of game, at all. The art is fantastic, but like many games of this type, I just don't feel invested in it because I don't feel like I'm really making any decisions that matter, I just am clubbing whoever I can club and then hoping I don't get knocked around too much when it isn't my turn.

Looks fun! Comical wizards duking it out in a ludicrously overpowered battle, what more can you ask for?

Having obtained a gift card, I went through various reviews to find a game to purchase. After watching Cryptozoic's ad for this, I couldn't help buying it. Come on, it's called Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards, for crying out loud.

The components look amazing and the game gives off this Munchkin vibe without actually being Munchkin, which is a good thing. Can't wait to try it.

It's very good, short and to the point. I like it a lot.

RATING: 9
The most metal art.  Reading your epic spells in your best wizard voice never gets old either.  Do you hope to survive an assault to go last each round with a powerhouse spell or do you chip away with weaker quick-hitters?  Best played with more than 2 people so that the attacks come from all sides.  You can always make your random deck draw work for you in some fashion and the level of strategy from the mix-and-match vs. unified power rolls is surprising.  A nice mid-level game that's not exhaustingly strategic, but isn't mindless either; I see a lot of people say that it's too simple - but I think a lot of them are missing the strategy that comes from timing your spells.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Excellent art but gameplay leaves the players with a feeling of minimal agency. If you get picked on and die in the first round there's nothing you can do about. If you won, congrats! lady luck is on your side. What makes it worse is that games with 4-5 people frequently take 90 minutes if one or two of the people in the group is new.

This game can incorporate a lot of players, but man can some games last a long time with more than 3! This game was one of the few games my friends and I would play on Saturday nights. We could easily play for 2 hours without someone winning! It was fun for a while, but with the extremely long play time for a lot of players, it started to get... overwhelming. It was becoming a chore to play. So now I only want to play every once and a while. Luckily, I managed to get my friends to enjoy more than just this game!

RATING: 7.6
Card game in which each player takes on the role of a wizard. The objective is to blow eachother to pieces with funny, extremely bloody spells. Each spell can consist of 3 cards (a source, a quality and a delivery). Each of the spell cards also has a glyph on them (dark, elemental,...). Playing more of the same kind increases your power roll, which means your attack will wreak extra havoc amongst your opponents. There are also treasure cards to be obtained which give certain benefits, but beware as some spells are particularly hard on treasure owning wizards. Once a wizard is eliminated he also receives death cards which give him a benefit at the start of the next round. A fun game.

A similar vibe to King of Tokyo, but more random and less strategic. Also, the game length can vary wildly, depending on whether someone sweeps the 2 points in a row, or the other extreme, we all get to 1 point before anyone gets 2 points. The art is amazing though, and the spell names are funny and fun to create and read aloud. These factors alone make the game worth playing.

A fun, light card game that the wife enjoys playing with me. Crude, gory and graphic, it is light, chaotic fun. The only real decision to make is 2 or 3 each turn, trying to decide for spell power vs getting it off first. There isn't much there, and there's only so many times you can smile at the card called "Testikill"...But I enjoy it, I like it and I'll continue to play it. BUT I only play a round or two because more than that, especially at higher player counts, the game overstays its welcome.

It's like Munchkin, except that there is hardly any player input, it takes forever, and the humor wears thin really fast.

Still, it wasn't the most unpleasant experience in the world.

RATING: 2.7
It's not that it's puerile. (I mean, the game is basically a mashup of everything a 10-year-old boy would think is cool)  What makes this game awful is how *long* it can go.  As soon as you get a Last Player Standing token, each opponent is going to gun for you to prevent the win, which means it's going to take several rounds if you're at 5 or 6 players.  Which can translate to 3+ hours, especially when you have that one guy who takes all day to decide what he's playing. (There's one in every game group, right?  I think there's a law or something...)

Sure, you might find the spells silly and amusing the first 10 minutes, but after the first hour, you're going to be bored out of your mind.

Incredible game. This is not my normal genre. It's a complete random slug-fest among friends. The game is random. There is a little skill, but mostly luck. Even sore losers are not sore at the end of this game. And although I dislike games that are not strict strategy, and I dislike majority of dice incorporated games, this game is great fun. The dice are elegantly used, so the rolls feel like it's a D&D structure on the line, rather than the game being built around it.

Apart from the art & language being a mix of heavy metal & mad magazine at times, the game is quite quick & fun. Player vs player in this works good as it doesn't feel like picking on people as it tends to go by people near you or people with the most/least health which is nice design choice. 

Lots of diversity in the options though it seems odd that they put in the non-used cardboard mountain (in this core box). Still quite fun for a beer & pretzels game between bigger things. Need to play the expansion to see how it adds to this beyond giving you more cards.

This is a GREAT gateway game: It has awesome art for everyone, it's funny, easy to play, & relies purely on luck. So it's mostly just to enjoy all the funny spells you come up with & try not to die first. But like CaD, the novelty of the crude jokes get old fast. Then all your left with is a game you don't want to play with real gamers & find a little tedious with new gamers because you have to laugh along as derivations of spells you've seen a ton before are seen by the new group for the first time.

A pretty comedic card combat game where you can chain up to three different type of spell cards in order to make one spell to destroy your enemies or heal yourself.

Not much strategy involved and your cards are determined by pure luck. It's not uncommon for an opponent to go first and completely destroy you before you have a chance to play.

One of those silly, brainless and extremely random games that almost play by themselves. Maybe OK to try once - and no more than once - for a few laughs, but that's it. It takes too long for such a light game, and I'm happy that I played it with just two other players. The art is gory in an amusing way, and I like how it is used to form a single picture when you line up the three types of spell cards, but there is nothing else to praise.

Equally fun artwork and theme. Gameplay can feel a little slow while you're waiting for everyone to resolve their spells one at a time but everyone (typically) still gets affected by every spell. Playable with two but definitely more fun with more people. Best part is coming up with synergistic card combinations and hoping you'll be alive long enough to use it.

[b]2.  Play the game as the art might suggest.[/b]  As gamers we often turn on the full force and power of our [i]n[/i]-ply–grinding minds to run the numbers on the permutations and puzzle out the optimal selection of one, two, or three cards from a set of eight, based on the interactions of said cards, the relative life remaining in your upstream and downstream neighbors, your own remaining life, and how that might all play out when interfaced with the possible choices of the other five people at the table, the treasures in play, and how that maximizes your chances of getting a point (or more!) while setting you up nicely for the next round...

Or, you could simply "kill Dave" because he totally has it coming.

It's important to note that the box does not have a constipated dude in a goatee, floppy hat and man-dress frowning at a shipping manifest while totally-not-slaves unload a bunch of cubes from a boat—instead it's what animators see while making news on day three of an angel dust and baby-stabbing bender, with a "rich, vibrant" (as FFG might call it) fantasy veneer.

It tries to say that in the rules, but we are gamers after all, aren't we?  And we'll all be goddamned if we're gonna let Dave put one over on us just because he spent that +1 brain cycle generating another surface for his three-space decision tree...

Everyone at the table needs to remember that this is a game where a wizard who has bourbon for blood can summon a giant testicle to attack his foes, and play accordingly.  (Read:  as quickly as possible.  No, really—we're done picking.  Flop that card.)

[b]3.  Soundtrack that shit with Mötley Crüe.[/b]  Just trust me on this.  It also makes people play faster, if only to get to the point where we can turn it off.

With all that our 6p games conclude inside a smack-talking, fate-tempting hour, making this an oft-requested night-ender.  Naturally, YMMV.

One of the first games I bought before getting into the tabletop hobby. I was attracted to the artwork and funny concept of spell crafting. These days, I still enjoy the game, but it can run a little long. The expansion looks to solve some of the issues I had.

Hilarious game that keeps everyone involved.  Great for 5 or 6 players because a lot of the cards damage multiple people.  Rounds go fairly quick so even if you get knocked out early, you're soon back in the game.  Very enjoyable.

Chaotic party game with great artwork and mediocre design. My main problem with it is that the cards have a lot of non-interactive text effects that bog the game down as players fiddle with resolving these cards. If someone took the spells and artwork, minimized the text to keep the game focused on casting wicked spell card combinations, and reduced the downtime in general; this would be so great.

Ridiculous, over-the-top "beer and pretzels" game.  Battles are high in chaos but there's some strategy involved to give yourself a competitive edge.  Winning involves predicting what your opponent is attempting to do and combining cards together to create the best possible combos.  May be too chaotic for some but this is an excellent leisurely game that's thick in theme.

Some more mature images and words may keep some players from enjoying this game. Great for a lite multiplayer game. Although it has player elimination, the eliminated players will come back with an advantage during the next round.

RATING: 8.5
MOST FUN GAME EVER!! Hilarious especially if you follow the rule that you must cast your spell in your best wizard voice. There is a surprising amount of tough decisions and strategy. It get's super tense when everybody has just a few life points - you must decide between playing a weak spell to go first in turn order and playing a stronger spell and going later, if you survive that long. Only downside is player elimination (in each round, not entire game) and the game can go long. I like the play to point value variant.

This took like half an hour to play one round and one player was dead before he ever even took a turn. Beyond that, there is way too much information on each card. If you're unfamiliar with the cards good luck trying to put together a spell.

RATING: 5
Crazy wizards with even crazier spells. Easy game to explain and pretty fun to call out the spells that you create as you play the game.

Player elimination per round can leave a bit of downtime though but it doesn't usually take too long for everybody to kill each other.

Game pairs best with alcohol.

Very good game where you and your fellow players create wacky spells to kill your opponents.

The Tabletop episode somehow got everyone all excited about RP'ing the voices... which I hate. I dislike these kind of silly things being forced on you by the game instead of it just coming out naturally. And this is the kind of game that would bring it out on it's own so that's a double shame...

What stops this game from being great is the luck of the draw and lack of ways to mediate it. If you could for example discard as many cards as you want before drawing to then redraw up to hand size... would make for all kinds of awesome combos to appear. And not turns like "So yeah... I gain 3 three life. That's it".

Kudos for Boulder-iffic by the way. Awesome and fun card :)

Artwork typically isn't a key selling point for me in games. However, for this game the artwork is a big turn-off. It was very outlandish and extremely distracting. That is probably what the game designer wanted but it is not for me. The game rounds only lasted 2 turns each and I only was able to take 1 turn each round. It wasn't very fun to only take 1 turn per round. Thankfully I was spared by the same person winning both rounds so I didn't have to play another.

Fun light game, it can play with 2p but since a decent number of the cards target players on the left or right, with only 2p it just means you're targeting your opponent.

You put together ridiculous spells to deal random amounts of damage to random opponents and try to be the last mage standing.

Don't play this if your looking for a serious game or a highly tactical one, you won't get that, it's a 
light-hearted acid trip competitive game.

Played once, 4p.  Wow, this is a silly game with a VERY simple ruleset.  You're building spells, with a maximum of 3 components, and sending the spells at your opponents, in a series of last mage standing rounds.  This game really wore out its welcome before the end of the game was in sight, since it is very repetitive each round.  I think the main market for this game are Munchkin players, not that it has similar gameplay, but it has the same feel.

KRAZZTAR'S IMPATIENT BRAIN-SUCK! This game has some nice humor in its theme, while still having enough strategy to make it more than just a time-killer. There's an interesting element of reading your fellow players and managing your risks, while also getting to just make up weird, anarchic spells to throw at each other. New players may make it slower than the theme feels like it warrants, but there's not a lot of analysis paralysis. Destined to become a staple for the more boozy end of game night.

Played this game at a con at 10am with a group that had stayed up till 2am playing it. That group made the game light, fast paced, and fun. I have played with other groups that wanted to think out each turn and craft their spells precisely. Those groups make this game slow, dull, and boring. Remember the theme on this is game is gonzo action and pick your group accordingly.

Lost this one in the flood. I still have the treasures and dead wizard cards, but the rest was trash.

[microbadge=5322][microbadge=670]

Standard set collection game that suffers from two large problems.  First, the sets have no real restrictions to them.  You can play a bad set and get work done, or you can play a great set and get better work done.  But there's no real restriction to how you build sets.  Second, there's a ton of extra baggage in terms of unnecessary decks and pieces.  Treasure cards, dead wizard cards, and last man standing chips needlessly prolong and complicate what should be straightforward game.

I had the huge misfortune to be sucked into the tenth level of Hell that is this game this past weekend.  I tend to be a gamer who enjoys randomness rather than pure strategy, but this game's randomness goes beyond even "Catan" and into the realms of Snakes and Ladders.  It's got very cute art, but there is no other value to it.  It is literally just random crap happening, with dice rolls for the sake of them.  There's no sense, no rhyme, no reason.. and the worst is, it just goes on.. and on.. and on.. and you long for the sweet sting of death to make it stop.  I can appreciate hilarity and chaos in a party-style game like "Pass the Brain" or "Munchkin" but these both have a fundamental, playable structure, which this lacks.

Simply make a spell from you 8 card hand (if you can) to inflict the most damage on your opponents. there are 3 parts to a spell - a begining , middle and end - each part belongs to 1 of 5 gylphs - match the gylphs on all 3 parts for the most effective spells - throw in a crazy treasures deck and bonus cards when you die and this game rocks.

Fun, silly, sometimes inappropriate.  Great card game, with tons of possible spell combinations.  Works well as a 2 player game, but plays better with 3 or more.

Each version/release of the game can be played as standalone games or combined for more spell variety.  Each expansion adds at lease 1 new mechanic to the game, which adds new spell tactics.

The best parts of Munchkin in a way shorter time. Its length makes it so you never feel like someone is just tearing down something you've built up from the beginning. It ends as quickly as it starts.

The fun part of the game is looking at the card art and pronouncing the spell names.  The not so fun part is the actual game itself.  Highly random with only a smidgen of control.

RATING: 7
Player elimination and light mechanics, reliance on silly voices and spell names, and Cryptozoic on the box should have sealed this game's fate for me -- not my thing, across the board -- but I quite enjoyed my first play. The Adventure Time-meets-Garbage Pail Kids artwork is fantastic, as are the spells; that goes a long way.

And the player elimination is brief, and brought about by what feels like just the right mix of randomness and mean-spirited decisions that it works and doesn't drag the game down. On top of that, I can see how once the novelty of the spell names and artwork wears off a bit, there's still a game under there worth playing. Good stuff.

A fun card game where each player is a wizard trying to be the last man standing three times.
You create spells in up to three parts (beginning, middle, and end) while being careful as to different synergies and how fast your casting will be.

The quick fire rounds combined with roll over bonuses if you get knocked out makes this game real gem; unlucky wizards come back stronger next round. Quite unpredictable, very malicious gameplay, quick and easy to pick up.

Great card designs, some entertaining names. Ideally a 4 player game, having more players doesn't add much but time to the game.

Good, silly fun.  Players are wizards putting spells together to melt the faces off their opponents.  Easy to learn, with some good mechanics to keep everyone in the game. There's a lot of luck involved but just enough strategemizing to make it at least feel like you're influencing your outcome.  Just don't take it too seriously -- this is all about kicking ass and having a good time.

RATING: 3
Random and chaotic game that almost plays itself.  The only real decision is how to construct your spells and that's pretty much it and even that is kinda random since it depends on your hand.

Might be more amusing if everyone plays drunk.  The artwork may or may not be a positive depending if you like a Robert Crumb, 1960s/1970s psychedelic art work of the cards.

And the game is way too long for it offers in terms of gameplay and you know, fun.

A little more math-y than I was expecting, which was a plus in my book.  I would suggest playing this in somewhere other than a public place so you can exclaim the name of spells in more dramatic fashions.  I'm in no rush to play this again, but I did enjoy it quite a bit.  

While it technically can support 6 players, I would not recommend playing with more than 4 at any given time since it's possible for the 6th player to die before getting to take a turn.

This game is bright and joyful.  It is Ameritrashy in a great way, it hangs in the space between being spastic fun and just plain unbalanced.  The player elimination can be a little frustrating for players, as turns can drag.  I put Mt. Skullzfyre on my bookshelf because it is art.

Not the best game in the world, but it plays somewhat fast (although it can definitely drag at times), is funny, and is worth buying just for the artwork.

Caution:  You will murder your friends, your loved ones, potential new friends.  I mean War is in the name of the game.

It's hilarious, the accents you throw on to be a wizard, are as varied as those that are playing it.  I find it to be full of replayability, due to the different wizards, and if you want to play nicely and try to get by without being attacked (until the end), or if you are out for blood from the get.

Definitely worth picking up.

Silliness, the theme and art is a lot of fun. Winning feels like luck.  Can go on too long for what it is. Bad with 2.  Can be a great party game, especially if you enforce the "must read each spell in your best wizard voice" rule.

This game is silly fun.  It's easy to pick up, with only needing to explain a couple things before you're ready to go.  The game is both random and not, as that a veteren player will put together better spells than a new player.  But a bad hand can kind of screw you.  Being defeated early does lend an advantage for the next game, but it's not enough if you get melted on your first turn before you even get a chance to play.

Fun to play with really fun art. Some people don't like the chaotic element but that keeps it fresh. Nice balance of strategy and also just luck in what cards you pick up. Especially fun to play when you get fun with your character. I've played a few times and definitely wouldn't mind owning.

This can be some good but silly fun. You start with 20 health. Draw a bunch of spell cards, which will variously cause damage to other players in all sorts of ways, be it strongest, weakest, left player, etc, and determine damage by by dice, fixed or other. Choose 1-3 spell cards (they come as start, middle and end spells, max 1 of each), simultaneously reveal and watch the damage fly. Weaker combos go first, best combos go last. But you may not be alive long enough to activate yours. Anyway, the last player with health left (which in a 5p game happens with the second playing of spells) wins a round, first to win 2 rounds wins. One of the nice decisions to make is whether to play less spell cards (causing less damage) and go earlier in turn order, hoping to knock other players out before they get to activate their spells. And you're also looking for nice combinations to play. Other than that, it's a very random affair, enlivened by the fun spell combination names (which must be read out!). For mine, winning 2 rounds makes the game go a few rounds longer than needed - everyone targets those who've won already, meaning it'll all come down to the last round after everyone's won one. Its nature is better suited to a 10-20 minute filler niche, over just one round maybe. There's too much chaos to want to play over 5 or 6 rounds, where each round is much the same, and the humour and chaos fun doesn't hold up as well. In a 1 round quick version, good fun and thumbs up, and that's what I'm rating here (it'd be lower for a full game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun and fast game.  My only complaint is I feel like you get about 1.5 turns before the round is over... it just feels too short.  But there are usually plenty of funny moments.

First play was using actual rules. (2 last wizard standing tokens needed). 3p, besides some normal rules checking, the game did not seem to drag. 

Verdict? A fun, slightly longer "filler" to play when partying.  I think using the quick play rules would make it to "True Filler" status, for me, anyway. 

That is how I'll play it next:

"Quick rules":

*Score 1 VP for each Kill.
*Score 1 VP if you are the Last Wizard Standing in a game.
*PLAY ONLY THREE GAMES
*If there is a tie, the tied player who most recently collected a LWS token wins. You don't get any VPs for killing yourself.

This one is a very light card game, it has enough "strategy" to be fun, but it ends quickly and dosen't require a lot of time or heavy strategy to be enjoyable.

It definitely shines with 3 or 4 players, more than that and the game becomes too long for what it is.

Based on one play: Funny cards depending on your taste, but the game is pointless. Just completely random and hope you survive or get lucky and have a great combo spell to play. Not really a game, unless maybe you are 15 years old and love to show off the cards.

This card game is certainly more about humor than gameplay, but it is worth a laugh.  You're trying to assemble long spells by putting together goofy incantations, and then launching them at your opponents.  Each spell piece does something different, but putting together several of the same type can have bonuses.  There's a lot of luck-of-the-draw here, and there are cards that work as catch-up mechanisms for those that didn't win a round.  It's silly fun, but don't expect anything strategic.

Don't play it as much as I want to because of the language (I don't live in an english speaking country) but when I get to play it I always have fun.  It is a fun game. 

I've been getting into heavier/thinkier stuff and this one is really light, so it might not get to the table as much as I want, but I really like it. I've played some crazy ones with unbelievable comebacks and great fights.

Time spent on it can vary a bit, it could be over really quickly or it could draaaaag for a long time, but if people playing it are into it, it will not feel long at all.

Great art, actually a friend of mine bought this one and the expansion for the art alone.

Mean spirited and random, but with the right crowd, can be its own totally stupid sort of fun.  Gameplay-wise, it is the kind of game a ten year old might dream up, but the art is very, very good, and fits the overall theme (such as it is) very well.  I'd describe it as juvenile, but not in an insulting way...that's what they were going for, and it works.  Not really my cup of tea personally, but dice chuckers and teenagers will likely have a great time.

+1.2 for excellent art.

The card combo system is clever and really fun.  Feels like it wants to be a party game, but the amount of reading and number of "rule exceptions" takes this off the table after beer #3.

Okay - so this game isn't deep or super strategic but it is downright fun (and funny) and with the RIGHT GROUP is definitely worth playing. Chaos. Mayhem. And there is strategy...honestly.

I'd need to play again. I remember this being cute and fun but not totally engrossing; it was hard to stay focused on the game for too long. Not that it's difficult at all, but I don't know if the complexity that's there fits the aesthetics. Probably best for metalheads who love cartoons out for a night of drinking.

OMG,this game is soooo funny.  It's also very cutthroat, you can really screw with your friends. It's a fast-paced easy game to play.  It's rare that my gaming friends like a game so much that they keep talking about it after the game has finished.  It's definitely not for everyone, but we loved it.

I've played this a couple times. It's pretty fun but some of those that haven't played too many card games (and who were drinking too much) might get lost because of the way cards have to go in order. I thought it was easy to pick up and play, but again, I've played many ccgs which this has mechanics similar to.

You would not catch me dead ever playing this game again. If I was on an island with gaming partners for the rest of my life and the only game we could ever play was this game, I would use it as kindling for a campfire. Put frankly, I would rather play the card game War than this.

I could choose my cards blindly and stand an equal chance of winning or losing in this game. It really doesn't matter, unless you're down to say the last 2, maybe 3. So this has that complete luckfest strategy-less aspect... made even worse by player elimination and having to sit around bored and watching the other players play a dumb game, knowing that in just a bit you'll have to play another round of this turd.

This game comes with a random stand-up volcano thing made of cardboard that serves no purpose at all. It is very fitting for this game.

I know people who think they don't like this game, but I think you're just not playing with the right people. This game can be played in a relaxed, jokey way with low stakes but high fun or you can include a decent amount of strategy (you should see some of the spell combos I've annihilated whole tables with!).

RATING: 9
Epic Spell Wars should be rated for exactly what it is: the best of its class (exceptionally fun, light-ish card games). It's a perfect filler, or perfect for an evening when the crowd just wants to relax and doesn't feel like taking three hours for Arkham Horror, Twilight Imperium, or RuneWars. 
The only reason it doesn't get a ten is that it does not fall into the rare category of "I would always want to play this game if asked, no matter how often." 

The proof of how good it is? A friend of mine and his group were set to play Arkham Horror and then played Epic Spell Wars....for 5 hours! 

P.S. The CEO of the company himself called my group back and answered a game-win-altering question when the geek was down. (Yes, we are a cheeky bunch.) Rather than being annoyed, he seemed pleased that we were having so much fun with their game. I am now a fan of Cryptozoic Games. :-)

Note: We went to the Cryptozoic booth at GenCon 2013 specifically to cheer for Cory and thank him for answering our question when BGG was down.  The Cryptozoic bunch are as swell in person as they were on the phone.

This is a pretty fun and simple 'take that' card game. There is some downtime and a lot of chaos but neither were unacceptable. There's some skill to how you build your spell, but a lot of it boils down to 'read your cards, see what does the most damage, hope it's cast before you die'.

This is a really wild and wacky fun game.  

This game is in the same league as other goofy games like Killer Bunnies, but the win mechanism of ESW makes it feel like a real game and not a luck fest of 700 cards.  This game would play fine with 700 cards though.  

Artwork reminds me of CD cover art for Lords of Acid.

The language on some cards and in the rules make it a little adult.

The art is amazing!  I love it.  I'm a big fan of Super Jail and this goes right along with it.  If only the game were remotely interesting.  Basically the game play is the equivalent of spinning a spinner and then if you are landed on, roll a die and you take that much damage.  There really isn't much here to play.  But man, does it look fantastic!  I love Mt. Skullzfyre, it may be the greatest useless component in the history of gaming.

I am a massive fan of "Flavor text" in games, and OH MY G O D does this game deliver on flavor text. The rulebook itself starts with 2 pages of ridiculously over the top, heavy metal laden words of hype. Some of the cards aren't very clear on what they do, but over all, a very enjoyable time. Just need to come to terms with acting silly.

RATING: 5
This game is pretty goofy and I love that about it.  It comes with a cardboard Mt. Skullzfyre which has no bearing on the game.  The art is a wacky cartoonish style and there are some crude card names and art.  Think Ren and Stimpy.

The game is played by fitting together three parts of a spell to create one spell to damage opponents, steal treasures from them, or heal yourself.  This continues until only one wizard is left standing.  Then the dead wizards draw dead wizard cards into their hand (limiting their options) but also receive treasure cards which ostensibly benefit their owner.

It plays pretty quickly and is interesting enough.  It's a bit simpler for a filler for my tastes (compared to something like King of Tokyo for example which is made most interesting with the power cards).

This is an amusing beer-and-pretzels game, mostly on the strength of its art and theme (which is PG-13). The gameplay is solid, too, since combining spell components is a lot of fun. There's player elimination, but it's not a problem here, since if you're eliminated early, you get lots of bonuses in the next round.

Another one of those "random things happen in an amusing way" games, Epic Spell Wars survives mostly on the strength of the astonishingly good art by Nick Edwards. There is some scope for real decisions around timing and spell composition, but it's still basically a game I would describe as "nothing is balanced and everything is fun". I think it's possible for a player to win a game with a single spell and a lucky power-roll -- this is a game of competing overpowered death blasts. Good for an occasional good time with the right crowd.

Lots of fun and lots of laughs

This is great for the right type of folks (anyone with a sense of humor).  The art is amazing and the spell names are laugh-inducing even late in the game, after some repeats.  From the start, you have to encourage everyone that they *must* read the full spell names and treasure card names too; it adds a lot to the proceedings.  If your gamers are up for a somewhat silly (but still very strategic) card game, it should be perfect.  I'd be interested in an expansion too.  Definitely worth the money. Buy this game and play it soon. UPDATE: Games with six really can drag on a lot.  And there is a lot of down time when anyone starts getting AP (or when you die and are waiting on the next match). Revising a 9 to a 7.5. SECOND UPDATE: Thinking of this more as a filler is perfect.  Just play till one person defeats the others. Still quick to get to the table and quick to pack up.  Back up to 8.5 for me.

Rapid-fire spellmaking makes sense; hey if it's going to be random anyway, why not make it FAST?  Strategy is minimal; simply make the best combo out of what's in your hand and do it quickly.  The art's the thing:  Epic Spell Wars looks like it was designed in 1977 by the team who did Cracked magazine.

RATING: 5
The selling point on this game for me was the art, with it's frantic hyper-violent aesthetic, Nick Edwards art reminded me of Christy Karacas's work, and any game that managed to capture the insanity of something like Superjail or Robotonomy seemed worth a shot.

The game itself, I was a bit less impressed by. It's not a bad game, to the contrary it can be quite fun... but its in the category of titles like Superfight where the game is as fun as  the players make it, so the wrong social circle just won't make the most of it. 

Actual play can feel slow and methodical, and frankly actively requires house-ruling (I'll get to that though). Most of the fun goes from getting into yelling out your spell names in your most dramatic wizard voice. The game functions well enough mechanically, but has what I and many other would consider a glaring flaw: the game by default involves a lot of RNG and very little strategy... Cards are drawn from communal decks, you play 1-3, you redraw to eight card hand. Basically the only tactical element is choosing which cards you play... which is meaningful, but not enough to make things tactically satisfying,

My strong suggestion is a discard based houserule... allow discards before drawing back to 8; this allows for more strategy as a player balances his desire to use cards later in better pairings and increasing the chance of drawing more synergistic cards. For players wishing to increase the challenge or add a handicap for the more advanced players, consider drawing one less card for every two discarded (rounded up).

This ruling helps the game A LOT, and takes if from lackluster to pretty decent... but it still just doesn't see play as often as other games in my collection.

What can be said about this game I mean you look at that amazing artwork on the front of the box and you realize this isn't a slow paced game. This game is a  lot of fun choosing luck and chaos over strategy and complexity. Fun with friends who are looking for fast paced action right out of the gates. Only real negatives is that the wizards are all stock and there is no personalities aside from aesthetics. I was kinda hoping for each wizard to have special effects based on their type of spells or something. Still the game is fun and in the right playgroup is definitely worth a try.

RATING: 6
Gameplay:
You try and kill other wizards (players) by creating spells. Your spells will do things like take X damage, heal and gain treasure cards. Your goal is to the be last wizard standing.

Pros:
+ Easy to learn. I've never had any issue explaining this game to anyone. After playing one or two rounds, everyone usually understands how the game works perfectly.
+ Anyone can win. Because the game is so straightforward, there aren't deep underlying strategies. The hardcore gamer in your group has equal footing as the more casual player.
+ Rounds are generally short. The simplicity allows for short planning stages and quick round executions. Sometimes you will get a person overthinking their turn (especially if they're close to dying), but this isn't usually the case.

Cons:
- Overplaying can affect replayability. Although there are many cards that come with the base game, eventually you'll start seeing the same ones pop up. The cards aren't extremely different in the effects they can do (usually it's just appropriating damage in alternate ways). This is heightened by the short game rounds and the ease of going through the deck. You'll either need to avoid continually playing during a gaming session (again, this can be easy to do because of the short rounds), or purchase the expansions for a bigger card pool.

Preference:
* Good artwork and theme. The goofiness can add to the experience if your group likes adult/crude humour. The art also makes the cards feel less dull (even though their effects might be simple).
* It's 60-75% luck-based. As with most (non-deck building) card games, the luck is in the draw. The more players you have, the higher the chances you have at taking damage before you can even respond. Now, there is a little bit of strategy in card play, reserving cards or manipulating turn order, but ultimately you are at the mercy of what you draw.

Overall Thoughts:
This is good for a quick and accessible gaming session. Like, an easy warm up game before you move on to something heavier. One that you'll pull out while waiting for the pizza to arrive. The quick rounds and ease of play lends itself to casual gaming. However, I expect more experienced gamers will get bored/frustrated with the heavy luck factor. If that doesn't bother you, then I recommend this as a fun and quirky warm-up/casual game.

Simple game that has as much randomness as planning.  A neat aspect of the game is the introduction of "Dead wizards".  This game plays in multiple rounds.  The earlier a wizard is defeated in a round, the more "Dead Wizard" cards they will accumulate.  At the beginning of the next round the "Dead Wizard" cards are activated putting the previous losers at a more advantageous position.

About [thing=112686][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=112686]Epic Spell Wars[/thing] simulates a battle between wizards. It is a bloody thing and the spells are like cornered wild beasts - it will hit anyone on their path. And they have some crazy names.

Wizards must prepare their spells at the same time, and these can be made of three parts: a source, a quality and a delivery. The shorter the spell, faster it will be and quicker your wizard will be able to cast it.

Once there is only one wizard standing, it will be the winner of the round. When a wizard that once was the Last Standing wins again, the dispute will be over and this wizard will be the greatest of them all!

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player has a hand of cards, and can use up to three of them (a source, a quality and a delivery) to create one spell. Each card has an icon, and matching icons will make the delivery stronger. Everyone will make their spells simultaneous.

The first to cast will be the player that made the quickest (shortest) spell. In case of a tie, will go first the player that have the higher number on the delivery card used. If there is still a tie (be because of same numbers, or because none of the tied players used a delivery in the spells), the players roll a die and the higher number starts. Order will follow this way until everyone with wizards still standing has executed their spells.

There is a blood mechanic in the game, which makes possible to spend blood points to enhance the effect of some spells. No wizard starts with blood points, but these can be gained during play.

Spells usually have weird effects, but most will hit one or more wizards and do damage. Every wizard starts with 20hp. If any reaches 0, the wizard will be out of the round, and starts to collect, for each full turn in which there are still wizards standing, some tombstone cards, that will give the fallen wizards some bonus for the next round.

Once a wizard is the Last Standing, she takes a token to remind this, and a new round, with every wizard, starts again. The game will end once the same wizard is the last one standing again. This wizard/player will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which cards to use to make the spell - not only for what they do, but also considering the combo of icons (to make the delivery stronger) and pondering about how quick you want it to be. This is very important, as the longer you will have to wait to cast your spell, the bigger will be the possibility that your wizard won't be standing when your turn comes up. These considerations are even greater when there are few wizards standing and the life of everyone is low - while a big fireball is usually better, sometimes all you need is a fast magic missile.

Also, there will be some decisions regarding who to hit. Several times the spell will say to hit the stronger wizard, the weaker, or someone with a creature - and there can be ties for these conditions. It is up to the player to decide which person to hit. However, in many times, this decision was left to chance - by the roll of a die, not because the player couldn't choose, but because going this way, was harder to create an enemy.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- An unique (and, for me, amazing) art style;
- A good sense of (dark) humor;
- Easier to play than expected, considering all the different effects of the spells;
- High interaction between players.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Has partial player elimination - a person is out of the round (but not from the game) when her wizard falls, and this can happen quickly and the player can be left watching the game for quite a while;
- Can be crazy long - the said time frame of 30-45 minutes [b]is a lie[/b] if you are playing with more than 3 players (and maybe even with 3). Three rounds, in a 6 players game, lasted around 2 hours! And mercifully it ended on that third round, otherwise it could have lasted twice as much;
- High luck factor - coming from the blind draw of cards, the random effect of some spells and several dice rolls throughout the play;
- A player can be out of the round before even playing;
- Worst than bash the leader, due to the random nature of some spells, the game also includes "beat the loser".

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a magic Thunderdome, but when many enter and one leaves. But then everyone enters again, and one leaves. Repeating the process until the same one leaves twice. There is a reason why they didn't do this in the Mad Max movie. It should be the same used to not use this rule here: saving everyone's time. Sprinkled with watching the others play for quite some time.

[thing=112686]Epic Spell Wars[/thing] is not a great game. But it is fun and has laughs and can provide a good time. For a while. Why do some designers like to harm their own games? I can't really say for sure, but seems clear that, if in the game every wizard had around twice their initial hp (so 40hp) and the game was played until there is only one standing and then it is done, it could be a whole lot better. Sure, you could still die before having two turns - but at least one you would have, and probably two also. And there would be no chance for the game to cruise past the 90 minute or 2 hours mark.

Yes, that would make the tombstones mechanic mute and the elimination, final. None of which would be a big problem, specially the final elimination, as the person can leave, if they want to, and if they watch the end, well, that is what they would do anyway.

The humor, of course, won't last all that long, but the gameplay is good enough to keep the players interested after it is "gone". There is a game here, not only a gimmick. But, man, oh man, that end game rule is bad for the whole thing. And to make it a little longer, they added creatures, which absorbe damage. Neat.

If playing by the rules, I simply can't recommend [thing=112686]Epic Spell Wars[/thing]. Too long, too andom, with partial elimination - a triple threat. With some variant for the game to end in one round, it can work and is enjoyable and different enough for a quick play of around 30-40 minutes.

 Epic spell wars is a good game to play  when you're just trying to play something and talk it doesn't take a lot of thinking to prepare the spells and the randomness of it means that no one is favored over someone else it's just basically the cards you draw and how are you roll the die. So I find this game is probably best to have a day in between game for when you're just trying to waste time and that's pretty much what it's good for.

Great art and very humorous.  Some interesting mechanics.  Find someone with a copy and play once for the "experience".  It's more of an activity than a game.  Very little control.  Loads of randomness.  Chaotic.  Some people might really like that but to me it defies the description of a game.

A fun filler game, especially as a break between strategy heavy games to let your brain go into hibernation for a bit, because there isn't much in the way of strategy here.

I would have liked to see more gameplay versions of cards. Keep the artwork (there's plenty of it, I couldn't ask for more) but give me some little variations. Even with the giant stack of cards available, there seem to be too many copies. We've only played a handful of games and we already know what most of the cards do, which is a shame because finding out what they do is actually kind of the fun part ("I draw a treasure and you do HOW MUCH damage to me?!"). When you can recognize the card as it's being revealed and you already know what's going to happen, it just makes it stale. The power roll cards help to alleviate this, but not by much, as the roll tiers are pretty obvious (i.e. one die will usually get the first tier, two die will usually get the second tier, etc), and the difference between the tiers is rarely enough to matter much. More potential crazy rolls would have been better too. Should have shipped with a d20 instead of 4d6! Critical hits!

Also would like some kind of discard mechanic, i.e. you may discard one or two cards at the end of round. There's some kind of weird meta here where getting rid of cards is this difficult thing to do (there's even a card that lets you get rid of cards as it's power, but you have to roll high to do it, which requires a good hand to perform!), so players are often frustrated by being stuck with a bad hand and being unable to ever fix it by the time they die. You can play an invalid spell on purpose (i.e. Source-Delivery-Delivery, then toss one Delivery), but even then it's usually only one extra card discarded. It's not uncommon that you'll get a hand of only two spell types, play an invalid 3 card spell just to toss one card and draw another, and draw 3 more cards that use only those types again. Perhaps a house rule is in order here.

The artwork and sense of humor weren't really my thing. Some of the little touches were nice. Lots of things happen but any individual turn didn't feel like it really had that many choices, the cards don't really combine in interesting ways. Not actually that much variety. Ran a little long for my tastes, but maybe that was me being grumpy.

Not a bad light-weight game, almost all of the enjoyment I've had has come from the names of the spells you come up with, and dramatically calling it out as you launch it.

Game-wise, it can be really luck dependent with what cards you end up with, and what your roll.  It always feels like it outstays it's welcome for what it is.

One of those random, long-named, kill-everyone games where it's possible to get eliminated from a round in just a few minutes.  That's exactly what it's for, though (dumb filler), so it's hard to be too tough on it.

My strong suggestion is to play with no more than four and end the game when at least one player grows bored, rather than going by the official ending.

[i]Spell Wars[/i] is certainly better than [i]Kung Fu Fighting[/i], which is longer, less funny, and doesn't have any die rolls.  Though it's strictly worse than [i]We Didn't Playtest This at All[/i], my favorite of the genre.

A decent multiplayer game on the "party" spectrum, especially for a lighter crowd.  Can entertain a more seasoned group for a few games, but the lack of depth starts to drag the fun factor down.  Also, in my opinion, games take way too long for what this game is.

This is an odd game but quite good. You put spells together out of component cards and fight against each other to be the last wizard standing. Each game lasts maybe 15 minutes and you play until you are done, person with most last wizard standing tokens wins. No other game I've played has mechanics like this.

RATING: 2
The theme was really promising, but fell flat in every single execution. The game is about a bunch of wizards attacking each other mostly at random, but some other time, you get to choose either the strongest or the weakest.

For a game supposedly full of conflict, there was very minimal interaction between players. No trash talk, no "he's gonna win, we gotta stop him together!" No backstabbing, nothing. Even stealing cards feel so dull.

You just draw random cards, make the best combo out of your cards, play it and hope you don't get too much damage from the others.

Very unusual feel to the game. Real time, but simultaneously taking and placing tiles. Constant thinking and then interaction with other players. This makes the game very enjoyable and it helped that I was taught in a clear way by the designer.
Beautiful graphics and combinations mean the game very high replayability.

Another Carcassonne style game I played this year, but this one is very chaotic as game pace is simultaneous. So there is some fun here, but not the kind of game I can think properly, it can be fun in a relaxed game night or into a party somehow, but I prefer other games for this purpose. I think I only thought this game would be more fun than it really is.

Kind of a slow and somewhat boring Galaxy Trucker. Since it is slower, the franticness is absent, which makes or breaks a game like this. In this case: breaks.

I am drawn to games like Tamsk and Space Dealer that introduce an element of time pressure.  So imagine a game of Carcassonne where everyone is playing simultaneously and an opponent can steal an unused tile from under your nose; that's pretty close to 4 Gods.  In my first play I admired the inventiveness of the design more than I enjoyed the game, but I can see that changing with familiarity.  

I find the artwork downright ugly, though functional.  Production quality is good.  The miniatures are small, but they do need to be.

Four Gods feels like a mishmash of several unrelated concepts and mechanisms that have been juxtaposed in a game that has no character of its own: the 30-seconds time limit per turn is my favorite part of the game but it clashes with its own tile laying/area majority core, which requires deeper thinking instead.

All in all, it’s not a terrible game but it didn’t impress me either.

Interesting game with some stellar elements: choosing your god/faction mid-game, placing tiles in real-time, feature control.

The problem is that all of these elements don't really add up to a special experience. The execution is just slightly off. I still found it enjoyable and novel, just not phenomenal.

Carcassonne vous connaissez ? C'est chiant, hein ? Faut toujours attendre son tour pour poser sa tuile. On a jamais la bonne. Et en plus, quand on joue avec un relou comme Camille, ça dure des plombes, le temps qu'il essaye toutes les combinaisons possibles. Pour dynamiser un peu ça, jouez à 4 gods ! C'est un peu sur la même mécanique de jeu : On pose des tuiles, il faut faire des territoires, poser ces meeples (ici, c'est des prophètes), construire des citées ... mais on le fait tous en même temps. On peut mettre des tuiles en réserve, mais les autres peuvent vous les piquer. C'est (à priori) le seul jeu de ce genre où, plus on est de joueurs (2 à 4), plus les parties sont courtes (Comptez 20/30 minutes).

[b]Rating based on – 5 plays, 2 player[/b]
A real time tile placement, area control game where you are racing to fill in a map of the world that corresponds to the way you envision it as the god of either the Mountains, Plains, Ocean, or Forest and claim your associated territory to score points at game end for your prophets, legendary cities, largest kingdom and largest number of kingdoms.

Tile Placement is my favourite mechanism so I have a lot of those games to compare. It's getting harder and harder to find any one that stands out but this one truly does. First off I love the box cover that is the 'right way up' whichever side you choose. Our thing is to rotate the god to the top who was champion of the last game :) It's super easy to setup and play, and I really appreciate games where you get lots of options and variety right out of the box and you have that here in spades. You can choose (or randomly deal) which modes to play whether turn based or real time, you can have visible or secret gods, and there are several valid ways to play for 2 players (secret mode, one or two gods each) which will all make for different play experiences. We've played the simultaneous mode always as we didn't think using the timed turns would be different from any other bog standard game...and what's the point of getting this game if you remove the real time element? In any case, we expected it to be a lot more hectic than it was. You do spend a fair bit of time making sure things match up so it goes by at a fairly even and relaxing pace. The tension comes from seeing your opponent claiming things and putting out prophets which spurs you on to place faster, but you don't really want to make a mistake because there are penalties...We are really careful about our placements and other than one incorrect tile in the first game we haven't had any trouble. Of course this might mean that we play slower than most....It is easy to get caught up in the world of 'puzzle completion' as my opponent found out to his detriment when he'd lost track of the area control aspect and was going about his own business just trying to make pieces match :devil: To be fair, it is a very satisfying feeling when you are able to create something out of your jumble of tiles, and there are those highlights when you find [i]just[/i] the right piece and have a eureka moment.

There are some negatives of course – the double sided tiles are irritating and there is an unholy amount of flipping back and forth as you can't remember every single tile you've seen so this adds to the game time, having to reach over and flip tiles in the reserve of your opponent is awkward and annoying (for me because their hand is in the way trying to place a tile on the board, and for them because I'm in [i]their[/i] way!), well enough for 2 players but I can see the chaos factor getting really high with all of the above taken into account so probably not great at higher player counts.

My gaming partner was skeptical when I pitched this game to him as he does not like speed, real time or time sensitive games. However, we both find this game lots of fun! If you like tile placement and map building games, area control games, resource management and putting puzzles together then I recommend this one be checked out.

fun and fast tile placement game w/ majority control scoring.  Basically carcassonne on speed. excellent concept w/ one flaw that really hurts it.  Its a fast moving game w/ tiny prophets that have to be placed rather precisely. The are constantly being bumped and jostled and occasionally end up in the wrong place. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
We played the free-for-all version and it was so stressful, frustrating, and ruthless. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but in our first attempt of playing this it caused me to tableflip - my opponent repeatedly stole my spaces 3 milliseconds before I would have claimed them. Will probably play again, though, since it's such a pretty game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
We played the free-for-all version and honestly it doesn't quite work. Tiles being double sided is a nice touch but in reality they are difficult to match and especially with simultaneous play a lot of mistakes were made, resulting in a lot of stop-start to the flow of the game, we also struggled with the placement of cities and how to then place tiles around them as you need 2 straight edges, and cities are round, which made the whole game play experience feel very clunky.

I like the simplistic scoring at game end and the selection of your [i]'god' [/i]at any point throughout the game play. I will give this a try using the timed turns and see if this improves the game play feel, otherwise I think it will take a good number of games and a lot of familiarity for this game to flow and actually feel competitive, rather than a group mapping exercise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A game where you are simultaneously building a world through tile-placement. Fitting the right pieces is surprisingly challenging, but that is what makes the game interesting. Placing gods at the right moment and on the right place is the way to score points.

There is time pressure yet playing it still feels pretty relaxed. Love the art and colors in this game as well, looks amazing on the table.

Un Carcasonne en temps réel ça ne pouvait pas être pour moi. Mais je pense par ailleurs que le jeu est difficilement jouable car impossible à polisser il y'aura toujours des bras au milieu. Il aurait pas fallu qu'on puisse prendre / retourner chez les voisins. Genre un sablier de 3 miutes puis tout le monde prend les 5 défausse ça aurait été la solution (eventuellement en conseillant de se lever pour changer le viewpoint sur le plateau).

Wow. Hardly ever played a game that I really disliked afterwards. An unnecessary complexity of the rules combined with the fact that you can outmaneuver yourself to the point where one can do nothing more but to watch the others (all discard places filled and one tile you can not place in every hand) prevented any fun coming up while we played this. The owner of the game closed the box lid saying "so this one is for sale".

RATING: 8
I was a bit put off by the art style, but the mechanics are pretty solid and the game in real-time is a nice little puzzle. It has this satisfying progression where you start by placing any tiles as you want - while by the end of the game you search for that one tile which fits exactly to what you need.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
You can play the game with timed turns, but really if you go down this route you may as well play something like Carcassonne – at its core 4 Gods is a real-time experience and in my opinion should be experienced as such. If you want a less chaotic experience then I suggest playing with just two, there are less hands flapping across the board but the gameplay doesn’t lose anything. If you want a break from heavier games and the opportunity to just open the box and start playing with spending ages setting up or waiting for your turn then 4 Gods offers some welcome instant gratification.

I like the idea and the components are good looking with a lot of nice details such as the little boxes for storing the pieces. The game play is very ruthless and most of the time you're trying to find the exact tile that will mess up another player or keep them from messing with you. It's interesting to play a real-time game that's so aggressive, but in the end I don't think it really works. I am not that big of a fan of tile-laying games though.

Matching corners (as in this game) rather than sides (as in the similar Mondo) is a lot harder. It's a good thing the rules say exactly what to do when errors are noticed (which depends on how soon they're found) because that happened a lot when we played.

RATING: 8
It's lovely. Much better with 2p than more players for us. With 3 or four there are too many pairs of hands crossing the board, grabbing the bag etc. It gets really annoying trying to see the map while someone is flipping discarded tiles for example. 

We also found it much better paced, not far off the same sort of pacing for a non-real-time game (if that makes sense). Being able to do what you want when you feel like it (in accordance with rules of course) was still there but there wasn't any real pressure to think quickly, although you do still try and act quickly once you've figured out what you want to do. 

So what we ended up with was a rather relaxing, very enjoyable, totally sociable shared activity of creating something sort of together and sort of against each other with what felt like less pressure than you'd find normally in gaming when people are waiting for you to take your turn. There really is no obvious, consistent downside to moving quickly or more quickly than someone else, in our experience so far. And so you sort of play at a pace comfortable to you and somehow also in harmony with your opponent.

Gosh it's hard to describe...

Loved it. Love it. And am very surprised by that fact because 'as described' 4 Gods is so totally not my thing at all.

I have a love/hate relationship with this game. It's similar to Carcassonne, where you are playing land tiles and trying to create masses of things. All players play simultaneously at all times and that's pretty cool, but it can end up being a frustrating game as you run out of obvious places to play and then it just becomes a big search by all players for a piece that allows the game to continue. This is basically a single-sitting jigsaw puzzle that has an end-game point system. It's fun but definitely frustrating enough to never play more than two games in a sitting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't care much for [thing=31481][/thing], or many real time elements in games in general. This game was clearly not meant to appeal to me, and it doesn't. 

The game is utter chaos as people frantically try to fill in the board. People's arms tangle as they reach across to flip over tiles on the other side of the table. It's a mess. I'm not sure why the tiles are double sided (aside from production costs) it seems to have a huge negative impact on gameplay.

It's a bit like racing to put together a jigsaw puzzle. If that sounds appealing to you, then check it out. Personally, I would like to have nothing to do with games like this :meeple:

4 Gods is a solid 4 for me. It's not a bad game I just don't want to play it, ever.

An interesting take on tile placement making it real-time.
The real-time aspects makes it stressful and tense constantly, but I didn't find that very enjoyable.

The realtime adds a new and unique aspect, but I still prefer it turn-based. As you can play this one turn-based, it offers some alternative, but the other mechanisms in the game aren't worth writing home about so it's not worth it.

Nany: La estética del juego no me invita nada a jugarlo. Me gusta más la vertiente de puzzle que tiene al formar el tablero, aunque me parece poco divertido en general. El manual deja que desear. Y en general me parece que por el precio la calidad del juego es baja(entorno a 40€ en 2016). Lo bueno es que puedes jugar una partida en exactamente 30 min. Pero después de dos jugadas pierde el encanto.

Pep: Buen intento pero sin llegar a conseguirlo. La ausencia de turnos lo hace diferente y a la hora de armar el puzzle es entretenido. El juego por turnos no me convence (demasiado estresante). El arte deja algo que desear. Para jugar media hora y ocasionalmente está bien.  Algo diferente.
Al final optamos por venderlo a alguien que al menos pudiera disfrutarlo realmente.

BEAUTIFUL! It drew me into the table immediately. Tile placement and pretty you had me locked. I can't say I was a big fan of the real time aspect to the game but I thought it was very clever how you don't start as a faction but pick one up mid game depending on your mood. Very clever. I really look forward to playing this in the full game. It is a top game for me to pick up when available.

Its real-time elements contrast sharply with the need to plan so many things — your expansion, hindering your rivals' expansion, which god to use, when to place a city or how to destroy a city — but its messiness is part of its hectic charm. The result is one of the oddest real-time games I've played, where watchfulness is often more valuable than quick reflexes.

RATING: 8
I would say if you like Carcassonne you will like this game, but that doesn't always seem to be the case.  However, we love Carcassonne and we love this too!  It's definitely more challenging, but retains a similar tile-laying concept.  You can only place tiles where they match everything around you, which means at one point or another you're going to be "helping" your opponents.  As you get about halfway through it can become quite difficult to find any tiles that can be legally played, but it still remains fun.  If someone lays down a city, it becomes everyone else's ultimate goal to try to find a tile to take that city out.

We do not use the simultaneous turn (non-stop play) rule but instead take turns around the table as we do in any other game.  If it was simultaneous it seems like one person could too easily get ahead and everything would just melt into utter chaos.  We do enjoy the hidden gods rule because you can never be quite sure what your opponent has and don't know who you're helping if you're not helping yourself.

Provisional rating, one play (real-time). Core game seemed fine, but I'm not much of a fan of real-time play - I want the chance to savour my good moves and plan to foil the good moves of my fellow players.

Hmmm.   A speed tile laying game where tiles laid must match all sides.  Score points based on your god and their corresponding terrain type.   Interesting 1st play.   Felt a little stressed out and I made the error of playing a tile that did not match which kind of messes things up.   

Pretty looking.

Real time tile laying game, or real time Carcassonne, I actually like it. it is chaotic but I like a bit of chaos in my life and there's definitely a "Take That" Component but it preys off a player's own ineffectiveness and impatience.

As others have said, it is literally real-time Carcassonne within a defined boundary and a two-edge placement rule.

This was pitched to me as 'real-time Carcassonne', and I can certainly see that: it's real time and you match tiles. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the fun that Carcassonne has. I think matching tiles is way too limiting here up to the point where it becomes frustrating. The fact that a tile has to match two straight edges and must match everything to adjacent tiles makes the game a real-time crawl. It ultimately slows down and simply isn't fun. Just chaotic. I didn't have the idea I had that much influence on the overall picture. Just put some tiles on the board, place some dudes on them and kinda try to make the most landscape patches and the biggest area of your designated landscape. So I guess I can see this as some sort of gateway game kind of, but is not something I'm willing to play again.

This is just not a game for me. I thought that I would dislike it, and that proved true. I just don't like competitive real-time games very much (with exceptions for some team games).

Ok, but kind of annoying when everyone's arms are reaching across and blocking the board.

The thoughtful, deliberate real time tile laying of galaxy trucker on a shared board with area control scoring.  Not something that's going to set the gaming world on fire, but it feels unique enough in play to warrant some time in my lightish/abstractish game rotation.  I'm looking forward to playing some more!

Played the free for all version of this. It's a hot mess. Everybody is trying to move fast that they end up making mistakes. Turn based might be the way to play, but I don't think that would elevate this above mediocrity.

Great Realtime Puzzle Game
Was a lot of fun to play but you need too much luck to win. I like more the strategic winning games.

Very interesting concept, though usually too stressful for me ;)

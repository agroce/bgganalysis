Print and Play.  Or buy it.

Played Mark's official copy. Rules explanation was tough, but game played in hour with a lot of the feel of BSG, but in less than a quarter of the time. Wasn't too brilliant as our novice infected didn't really flex his muscles much.

Would like to play again.

RATING: 7
I initially had this at an 8 after my first play, but I'm dropping it to a 7 after a second go. I think this shines as a BSG Lite, but had a really unpleasant experience in my last game. It reminded me too much of all of the things I despise from Werewolf - baseless accusations, characters with no (or limited) special abilities (2nd time playing as Daniel, please no more), etc.). With 7 players the turns take forever, and when it got back to me I didn't have any meaningful decisions I could make (especially when I was in quarantine half the game and had limited dice to roll).

RATING: 7.5
Formerly known as BSG (Battlestar Galactica) Express. Each crisis is based on dice roll instead on playing cards. 
I love BSG the board game, however, Dark Moon comes with a similar traitor tension, shorter play time, simpler rules, and better support for different player counts. 
Dark Moon feels a bit too abstract, the theme is weak. It is the first time, where I understand people who complain about the missing thematic integration. Dark Moon does not tell a story. The game feels more mechanical: task xxx happened, roll dice, next.

Player: 3-7

RATING: 7
Captures a lot of the feeling of Battlestar Galactica but plays in less than an hour.  It doesn't have the constant feeling of doom as in the full game though because sometimes you can be in quite good shape and then a couple of turns later, bam!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I adore Battlestar Galactica-- the TV show and the game. But as time puts the tv show even further into the past, and I make new friends, I find fewer people who were into the franchise as much as I was, and so the appeal of the awesome tie-in game, and all the mythology it's entrenched in, draws less interest in playing from my gamer friends. And that's before I even mention "three-hour length." 

So I hesitantly got Dark Moon based on the exciting reviews here that insisted the game could be played in only 45 minutes, and distilled "the best" of the BSG game into its experience. I'd argue a little with that-- there aren't awesome space battles, blasting people out of airlocks or frantically hyper-speeding away from a pursuing army-- but the second-guessing paranoia concerning hidden identities is here in full force, and the designers have done a good job of creating their own mythology around the mechanics to hide the BSG Express origins. (Though I did feel a lot of personal BSG-geek glee when the "mandatory blood test" card came up.)

Between a how-to play video from GameBoyGeek and stumbling through the relatively condensed manual several times, we finally got into the groove of the game thirty minutes in. But 45 minutes it was not. We spent nearly two hours, and with just four players. But we had a blast trying to figure out who was our sole infected, and erroneously voting people into (and out of, and into again) quarantine. We got so far that we had only one task left to complete before we uninfected won the game, and the infected guy, who we were criticizing for not playing well enough, snatched victory from us. We delighted in accusing and table talking who was infected and who was being honest or dishonest. We debated who should spend dice or not. And we used our special character-specific powers here and there, too, though the main focus was on keeping things repaired and talking. Afterwards, we wanted to play again, with just us or, even better, more people (and therefore more infected!). Our infected player felt he had to hide most of the game because he thought he'd be too hindered in his abilities once revealed, which is also what the manual advised doing (remaining hidden).

Without the BSG mythology, this game gives off much more of a "The Thing" IN SPACE vibe. So one potential detraction is infected can't infect other people, which you so want once you've made that "Thing" comparison. And unlike BSG, you can't just blast an infected person out an airlock-- you're stuck with them (revealed or not) for the duration of the game, and it doesn't make a lot of sense that they're still contributing to or detracting from things. Just lock them up and throw away the key, right?

The only other ding I have is the people portraits' artwork leaves a lot to be desired-- the artistic style and coloring/shading aren't appealing, and the box cover only emphasizes this. The graphic design of the strange sci-fi dashboard of the game board works very well, though.

Recommended!

Positives
- Creates paranoia and second guessing very well
- Plays well with many different numbers of players
- Hidden dice roles forces doubt and uncertainty
- Great standalone theme and obfuscation of BSG roots

Negatives
- Tie between completion of malfunctions and completion of victory path goals is very loose and unclear
- People artwork leaves a lot to be desired
- How to juggle dice between "spent" and "available" resources not clear in manual (dices move from spent to available once the specific task in question is complete, which could be in the middle of a player's turn)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Not impressed by this game. Even though I won I was frustrated for the most part of the game. The die mechanism is poorly designed, it leaves you with too little control. There are too few victory paths for the infected – three different conditions are offered but they are virtually the same. Playing Dark moon felt like play-testing an unfinished game which I would not be sure could be tweaked into something good even if the designer tried. I'm not a fan of Battlestar Galactica either but I rate that game a lot higher than Dark moon.

I would play this game every time if others would play with me.  Maybe it's good that others don't want to.  There is something anti-climatic about it in the middle, but there are moments in every game that are well worth the play.  It's pretty well balanced.  And it is truly better with more players.  I recognize most people will see my rating and think I'm out of my mind, but I stand by it.

RATING: 7.4
After teaching to each new group, the request has always been for a second game.  It's a fun "hidden traitor" game and plays in about 1 1/2 hours. Careful attention must be paid to the rulebook, as we missed a few elements on our first couple of plays. A description of "BSG light" is fairly accurate; however, a 5 player game of BSG is still much better.

Dark Moon is hands down the best traitor game on the market.  The plausibly deniability with the hidden dice rolling makes it (relatively) easy to remain hidden as the Infected while still tanking the tasks.  (Unlike other traitor games where it's durn near impossible to stay hidden.)

RATING: 8
great streamlining of BSG/hidden traitor games. I already hated BSG for its length and lack of interesting decisions but this would have absolutely burned it alive for me.

scales very well from 3-7, but 5+ recommended as 2+ infected amp up the experience. Also, unless you are playing with skilled liars the voluntary blood testing task should probably not be used in 3 player games as it can kind of break it. 

Hidden dice rolling mechanic is fun and gives some very good cover to the infected. Interesting in that they are much more effective much of the time when hidden, the ideal situation is to reveal right when you can end the game by doing so. One hidden + others revealed is effective too. 

Check this one out!

Creating a streamlined version of Battlestar Galactica wasn't a terrible idea.  Yet Dark Moon seems to throw the baby of thematic immersion and real options out with the bathwater of Fantasy Flight bloat.  All that remains is a bunch of things to prevent going wrong, a traitor and a rather boring dice rolling exercise. 

Production quality is good and the artwork is suitably dark.

A quicker version of BSG.  Same feel, same accusations flung across the table.  For fun, I actually played a game revealing myself to be infected immediately, and my partner (I did not know who this person was, mind) stayed hidden for a while.  Both games, the Infected won, but the last one was VERY close.  A very tense, tight game.

Solid traitor game with a theme reminiscent of stuff like John Carpenter's 'The Thing' or the Deadspace video game universe. Infected face off against Uninfected, and the hidden traitors can be revealed and still participate in the game. Solve various malfunctions before they overwhelm the Uninfected, by rolling various dice. There's also a Commander role present who can order other characters. It's pretty sweet, all told, even if I haven't played it's spiritual predecessor BSG/BSG Express to compare. Fans of Dead of Winter will find this a strong alternate.

Dark Moon is better than BSG in every regard that is important to me.  Time to play, more space for sowing doubt and less chance of giving it away to card counters or people who want to boss what you do in the game.  This one is the winner in this category, for me.

A hidden role game that is streamlined and has a clever dice/cooperative mechanic. But ultimately a game that has a lot of randomization and one that centers around whether you trust a player or not.

I've never played BSG and the main reason is game length. I just don't have time to play 3+ hour games that often however the concept is right up my alley. So when I heard there was a short version of BSG I knew I had to try it. After just a couple plays, I see this staying in my collection for a while. It's got more substance than something like The Resistance but doesn't bog down like I feel Dead of Winter sometimes does. An initial rating of 7.5 but I can see this going up with more plays.

Update (Oct 2017): 7.5 => 9
This game has become my go-to hidden traitor game that we can play in about an hour. The hidden dice rolling that sometimes forces good guys to submit negative dice (and even infected to submit positive dice occasionally) is superb. Every game leads to funny moments of accusations and betrayals.

Amazing. I love how the new mechanics manage to preserve the various tensions that can build up around the table. Very ingenious.

The only reason why I'd play the "real" BSG instead of this is because of some of the variants found in its expansions.

Edit after 3 games: the game can clearly lack tension during its first half (it gets much better after the new loyalty cards are dealt, and makes me think of a mix between The Resistance and BSG vanilla), but it doesn't bother me nearly as much here as it does during a 3-hour game of BSG.

Interesting semi-cooperative game, you can see how it started life as Battlestar Galactica express. Enjoyable mechanisms (the dice add an element of randomness to the cards of BSG) though, like BSG, it seems quite tough for the uninfected.

Solid title.   Like many have described, it is very much BSG lite.     What Battlestar excels at over DM, is the feeling of a team effort.   I felt the actions you choose at the start of your tun in DM to be random.   Never did I feel like I HAD to do this one thing.    In BSG, there are real decisions that need to be make sometimes when choosing your action.   

I do like the task selection and participation aspect of DM.   The in/out part is well designed.

I rate it as a 7 as it is not hard enough to get new players into, and it certainly is a fun game, but I would almost always play Battlestar Galactic if time was available.

I'm not a fan of hidden role/traitor type games, so getting a 6 from me is probably about as good as a game in this genre is going to get.

The dice are clever, as they give a means for the traitors to bluff without it being totally obvious due to being weighted with more unhelpful values than helpful ones. The game is also a pretty simple one, but with enough meat there to feel like there's some game there other than just arguing over who the traitors are (which is the part I can't stand about hidden traitor games; you spend more time arguing over who's a traitor than you do playing a game, which doesn't feel like a game to me).

Overall some clever ideas, and about the only hidden traitor game I wouldn't mind being drug into.

A short version of Battlestar Galactica. Not as goos as BSG but a solid replacement when you do not have 3-4 hours on your hands. I do very much like how dice rolls are secret so the infected people have the choice of when to sabotage. The only draw back is that the tide can turn very quickly and, in the right situation, the infected can end the game without a possibility of resistance from the other players.

I'm not really sure on this one yet. You know, this gets compared to BSG (for obvious reasons, in that case) / Dead of Winter / Shadows over Camelot a lot but personally it strikes me most as an improved Resistance.

It's not a complex game, but there are a lot of little moving parts and a somewhat vague rulebook so it truly does take a full game to understand it - even after our first game, there's still a couple of iffy points I want to look up on the BGG forums before we play again.

The dice system is an excellent addition to the genre. Making a traitor game where good guys are forced to sometimes do bad things is just brilliant and results in so much necessary uncertainty and paranoia. It's great.

I was worried about some initial reports that this game is really tough for the traitors as you have to lie openly, which you do, and I could see that being an issue when you've only got one infected potentially... but with 3, it felt totally fine. In our first game all of the uninfected suspected different people of being infected so maybe our group is just extra good at lying but it really put me at ease about the whole open submission thing.

I will say that perhaps compared to other traitor games, Dark Moon relies a bit more on opportunism for the traitors to win. In our first game my boyfriend won for the infected after being super helpful to the uninfected the entire game, but then immediately pounced on an opportunity to reveal himself and end the game in the same turn. I can see how someone might be turned off by the "swingy" nature of this, but to me it just shows that the uninfected really have to stay ontop of repairs!

I can see the complaint that this game is pretty abstract, and despite some cool board art I'm inclined to agree. Again though, this is no more abstract than The Resistance so I'd be confident in saying that if you like that, you'll like this too. 

Also - the cooperative game isn't that interesting on its own. You have to get people who are willing to just get into the accusatory aspect and really MAKE that shine. You kind of have to bring a bit of your own fun to this game, I think.

Edit: In a total surprise to me, I think Secret Hitler may be on track to replace this game. It seems to me Secret Hitler's card mechanic accomplishes the same thing DM's dice system sets out to do, but it retains hidden information. And the bad guys know who their teammates are, preserving the group planning. I do like the theme in Dark Moon better though, and I think it probably scales better. Will have to do some more direct comparisons.

I'm not too enthusiastic about Battlestar Galactica, mainly because it's too long, so I was excited to try this game which many have called a distilled version of BSG. However, while it's shorter, it's also definitely more boring! The interesting parts in BSG are gone, and the whole gameplay fell very flat in my so far only play; the bad guys (me and another) had a tough time in the first 30 minutes, where we thought it was game over, but then the game suddenly shifted in our favour, and it took like 1 hour where the good guys didn't move forward at all. It was just a stalemate more or less - quite boring. Also, the secret roles wasn't as well implemented as in many other team/traitor games - and this is one of the most important things to get right I think. So, all in all it fell flat, and there are many other hidden role games I would rather play.

I'll need more plays, but it didn't seem to "launch" nearly as well as Dead of Winter, which has similar elements. Perhaps it's more appealing when you know it's a reduction of Battlestar Galactica; new players who'd never played BSG found some of the rules confusing. Also, the voting system is ... bizarre. I can only vote as I wish if I have the proper color die in my hand?

Still, the group seemed to enjoy it by the end....

Nice PnP Project! Super excited to try!

Very good indeed. took us 2 hours on 5 player first try. Not easy being a cylon as there' not much ways to hamper the humans. Need more plays to discover the tactics.

This is a semi-cooperative game.  Each person has secret goals that they want the group to do to help them win, but you also don't want the board to win.  In our case the board cleaned out slate.  It was not a good gaming experience.

Base game was interesting, filled with tension, but ran just a little too long for me (I'm just not a social deduction person). Probably about a 7 - it's a good game, but I'm probably not the target audience.

The game with the expansion though was a pile of mess (especially with everything thrown in). It had unfortunately left such a negative impression I'll never play it again even if it's just the base game.

We played with 4 and then with 5. And each game feels different depending on how the players act. The dice have a higher chance of rolling negative numbers which make the group suspicious of everyone! Lots of fun, and great because of the banter, tactics and twists.

RATING: 8
This game has grown a little on me. It is very group dependent. If you're tired of a hidden traitor game where everyone is just talking (yelling) around the table (resistance), this is a great alternative. It is hard for the infected to win if you are playing with six. Best with 5 or 7. It can get repetitive at times.
Raising my rating to an 8 after finding a couple of small rules we missed (only task cards are used for the final event) and the game is more balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With the right people, it can be fun - but not as immersive as BSG, for example. Sadly this game is very badly produced. The box is way too big and not safe for transport or delivery. You will most likely get damaged components due to a lot of free movement of pieces in the box. Also: The rulebook is a mess and quite hard to understand! Learn it from someone who knows it already.

Players are crew members of the Galactica, trying to flee from the Cylon menace.  This is basically a cut down version of the Fantasy Flight monster, playable in about an hour.  In order to solve the various dilemmas facing the Galactica, players secretly roll and allocate dice.  The traitor/cylon players are trying to sabotage the effort, while appearing innocent.  A solid game, much better and more playable than the parent game - certainly deserves to be fully developed and put into print.

One play. Good game. Hidden dice rolling allows fun opportunity for plausibly deniable sabotage and accusations. But (at least in my one play), the various actions, stations, and tasks did seem to add much to the fun part of the game (mentioned above). On most turns, it was obvious which action was the "best", so picking among them wasn't much of a choice (unless you wanted to be obvious about be infected). Overall, I'd rather play Resistance because I'd rather just have the fun part of the game without the extra stuff. But, this might just be a newbie talking.

[b]BSG Express PnP comments:[/b]

This is a lighter version of Battlestar Galactic which uses dice to replace Skill Cards and Crisis Cards.  I was actually really surprised with how many other elements they managed to keep or at least feel similar to the normal board game but boil it down to about an hour.  I think this game would be a good stepping stone to playing the full game.  It was an interesting game, but it has the same problem I had with The Resistance: The game is pretty quick and thus I don't feel as invested in figuring out who the bad guys are.  Also both this and the Resistance are mechanically pretty easy. I'm wondering if I'd play it more, it would grow on me, but I don't think I'm going to give it the opportunity as it's player cap is 5 and with that number I would rather play the full game.  It's hard for any traitor game to be compared to the original BSG when it's my favorite game.

RATING: 6
Played once.  It reduces the BSG board game down to a 1 hour affair.  While this is a worthwhile goal, our game saw the players largely performing the same action over and over again (Jump Prep, I think it was called) -- it wasn't until additional loyalty cards were dealt that the game got interesting.  Still, it provided some of the BSG board game flavor in much less time, so I suppose it succeeds in it's design goals.  I'd play again if asked, but prefer to stick to all of the richness of the board game.

RATING: 5
This is a game like Dead of Winter that sounds terrific on paper but just doesn't live up to the promise in practice. With the theme and chrome of BSG removed, you're left with the mechanisms, and the dice rolling that should provoke a lot of paranoia instead saps the tension by ruling the day.

Players committed to the crisis have to play a die, and they may not have a choice due to what they rolled. Suspicion is undercut because people know "he may have had to place that die" vs "somebody threw a negative card in!" My plays have been underwhelming in the same way for Dead of Winter. What sounds like a great game in theory just doesn't get airborne. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, tense and very fast to play. It features the meat of what you love about the hidden traitor game in 2 hours. It doesn't kill BSG, but it may be a preferred alternative to the bloat that is every FFG property

Update - definite improvement with more plays. Enjoyed this game a lot, though always seams weighted in favor of the infected. However I'm always playing it with new people. The issue order action never gets used enough and people aren't hitting suspects hard enough. Definitely keen to play this one anytime I get chance.

[b]Sold 7/9/2017[/b] - I liked the idea of Dark Moon a lot, and I liked the game play a lot too, but the game was just wonky and weird enough that it was difficult to teach.  While it's a lot shorter than Dead of Winter, I'd much rather play that game (which I've taught a gazillion times) than try to remember how to play Dark Moon, let alone how to teach it.

Streamlined 'express' version of BSG that seems to take all the mechanics out!

As an express version it still takes upwards of an hour... which in my definition is not an express version.

All the skill, and mechanics of the skill challenge which is the central mechanic in BSG has been stripped away completely and replaced with a die roll which has 4 of 6 faces as a negative. :wow:. Is it even possible to complete the challenges without the added traitor elements?

Gameplay itself is really dull and incredibly repetitive, either you roll dice and then lose them or don't roll dice and gain more to roll next time. Calling this a hand/dice management 'mechanic' is pushing it a bit don't you think?

We also found the bluffing/hidden traitor mechanic tacked on and completely superfluous since even if you are not 'infected' you are probably gonna add bad dice to the challenge therefore what is the point in being a traitor? and if you are a traitor/infected why would you stay hidden when your actions significantly upgrade when you 'reveal' yourself?

Not worth the cardboard it was printed on... let alone the hefty £50 price tag this currently commands!

Theme could be better utilised, giving the game more of a The Thing vibe, but it is a quick and refined version of an already very good fan variant for an excellent game.  The components are art work are a bit hit and miss, but there is a strong experience that plays out in as little as 45 minutes.

BattleStar Galactica light it is, as it scratches the BSG itch. All the BSG elements are there, with some streamlining and less theme. The hidden dice roll mechanic is novel and is my favorite part of the game as consecutive bad rolls (or not!) can throw heavy suspicion on players being traitors (or not!). Great game overall!

The game was all kind of meh. The mechanics were similar to BSG (obviously) but the game  play seemed random. There was no way to really manipulate the dice and pretty much what you rolled is what you got. Most of the game there seemed to be only one action worth doing repair. I could see the game being quicker but I would rather play BSG for this experience or a different traitor game for the 1 hour time frame.

I bought this because I was looking for a quicker way to play a game I love, BSG. Unfortunately, everyone in my group decided we would rather put in the extra time for the original experience. It just felt more constricted and like the dice dictated my actions too much. Maybe it was an illusion, but BSG made us feel like we had more control over how we played compared to this game (because of how cards work). Sorry for being vague, its been 3 years since I played. 

---This is meant to compare BSG to BSG Express. I am not sure what changed when the game was re-implemented and published as Dark Moon.

RATING: N/A
This game surprised me! Retro SciFi theme, well executed semi-cooperative play, unique dice mechanics, hidden traitor, and lots of variety of re-playability!

Between this and Dead of Winter — YUM! Dark Moon also meets the need when we have 6 or 7 players, or when a full game of tasty Dead of Winter would simply be too long.

Loving this so far. 
Our first game was a huge mess, because we missed some key rules.
But our later plays have been great. It keeps the hidden role deduction of Resistance and BSG, but with an added twist that the dice will sometimes force you to look like you're infected, which is tons of fun.
And it strikes the middle ground... not stupid long, like BSG, but not over too quickly with no real gameplay choices apart from deduction, like Resistance.

Formerly known as BSG express. To compare, it is smoother, more clear on when to bluff, and easier to grasp immediately. It does, however, lose the fantastic act two turn around from Battlestar Galactica. Like Battlestar, it needs to be played multiple times with the same group. Plays will grow more enjoyable as it goes on. For a "one shot," there is not enough meat.

I was hoping for the new overhauled, streamlined BSG experience. That didn't happen.
I wonder how many games are being published these days that make a huge splash before release & are forgotten 2 months later.. all that cardboard piling up on peoples shelves..

BSG is too long no question, but Dark Moon doesn't deliver the same level of intensity.. yes you don't know who the traitor is, but once you know the game becomes very predictable, with no hidden information like cards you rush through these events by just rolling dice.. once revealed that whole mechanic could be scrapped.

The event cards somehow left a lot to be desired, they seemed very samey, whereas you had several threats from different angles in BSG here it's all about these 3 similiar looking crisis tracks.

I predict i will never play this game again, not because out of dislike, but just because no one will ever suggest playing it.

I have a sweet spot for co-op's in which one or many can turn against the others (or might be secretly against the others from the start). This is exactly a game like that. This has the Alien-like atmosphere (confined space, unknown threats, dark halls and corridors). I love the theme and the way it seems believable in terms of science fiction story telling of the game. This kind of theme and setting must be one of the best for this kind of game. Visually game looks a bit outdated (or cheap) but on the other hand, it just backs up the great old school sci-fi feel and theme.

It's not a bad game, but  will probably never replace Dead of Winter or Battlestar Galactica for me. It has cool mechanics and plays in a much shorter time than BSG, which is one of its graces, since BSG can take 3-4 hours. 

Component quality is ok. I love the board design, but the artwork on the cards is passable at best, and for what it's including in the box, I was left saying "that's it?" 

My biggest gripe is the Game should be priced nearer to $40 MSRP(not $60), around 27.99 for online prices, Cause what you get in the box compared to other games such as Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, Mysterium, and is pretty criminal

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A longer social deduction type game, with a fun hidden dice rolling mechanic at the heart of it. The dice being weighted towards negative numbers can make for some interesting tension.

Like: The genuine feelings of suspicion based on the tasks people choose, and the dice they keep submitting. How close the game can get - on two different plays, the outcome has been determined by the final task, and even dice roll, in the entire game.

Dislike: Possibly a little too favourable to the infected players, games tend to either be coin-flip close, or a comprehensive infected win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Can definitely tell that it started it's life as "BSG Express", you can see the mechanics distilled into a quicker playing game. BSG has it's place with the right group of players, but runs a little long form the group I regularly play with now.
Dark Moon, however, plays quick and gets the core suspicion flowing quickly. The randomness helps keep people on their toes and the players I play with enjoy it. The Infected player has one about half of the time, so they end nobody is too worried when they draw that role. 
I've only played it once with 5 players (the regular group I play with is 4) and it was more fun. Having multiple infected players definitely ramps up the suspicion. Can't wait to try it at the full 7 one day!
Only thing I wish (though I don't know how it would be achieved) is to maybe see more Character Roles, but that just might not even add much to the game.

The hidden screen and dice that are designed to work against you make this a VERY fun game. We love playing the game as the wrong "we/they/us/" turns into wild accusations and diplomacy.

Nicely "balanced" but with more players at the table the "Infected" should probably out themselves sooner than later. With the max player limit, each player had maybe 2 or 3 turns, really limiting their additional powers.

Very fun game regardless.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2013)

As I love Battlestar Galactica (the series as well as the boardgame), I had huge expectations from BSG express. It follows the same core ideas as the FFG boardgame; however I didn’t enjoy this game as much because, although fun, the BGS theme is not there anymore (the tension is also gone along with the opportunities for clever play). All is done via dice and I don’t like that very much. It has too much luck, there is no way to control anything.

The games can be played under 1 hour though.

The copy I played was beautifully done. I’m glad that Stronghold picked up this game with another theme. Perhaps I will play it again but as it stands, I will play the FFG game over this one always.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 9
I'm pretty impressed. It does 80-90% of what BSG does in a third of the time.  The "fun" part of BSG is distilled into BSG Express.  Some of the extra actions, theme, and subtle aspects of BSG are stripped out so I think BSG still has a purpose but it usually only comes out once or twice a year but has the advantage of extra characters and variations to keep it fresh.  I think BSG Express might get stale after a few plays but it's worth building

RATING: 8
Traitor game with some very nice twists, the use of dice especially. Didn't care much for parent game Battle Star Galactica (in fairness it was very badly taught, but did drag), but this I like. Condensed playtime is a big bonus.

Artwork suits the theme of trying to survive a crisis in a God-forsaken, beaten-up mining outpost on a barren moon.

2015-09-23 - I'm giving this a 7 after one play, but I really expect that to go up with future plays. This is a fun hidden role game that does have some of the feeling of a BSG, but plays much more quickly. The first game didn't quite have the tension I would have hoped for, but we were all learning so I think that will change as we get more comfortable with the flow of the game.

2016-06-29 - After 8 plays, I'm bumping this up to an 8. It plays fast, and the more we play it, the more we get that tense feeling of "Who are the infected?" I've played it at 4, 5, 6, and 7 players and really enjoyed it at all of those counts.

BSG Express: It is pretty remarkable that the flavor of the series and the original game can come through so well in a shorter and more random game.  Well done.
That said, I think the full game is a more satisfying experience if you have the time.
Also, I don't think that comparing BSG Express to The Resistance is fair to either game.

This does a good take on the traitor element without dragging on. Games are shorter than most other traitor games I've played without sacrificing the suspicion element. The dice do a good job of covering bluffs from the traitor, too. The game always starts happy, but fingers start pointing as the systems degrade over time.

This is the perfect weight, play length, and blend of deception, unfriendly conditions, and compelling immersion.

Manages to cut the play time by 1/3 to 1/4, but sucks most of the theme out of the game. Do you play BSG for the Cylon reveal, or for the journey?

If FFG's BSG is too long for you but you like BSG, this game is a good fit. If you don't mind length and you prefer theme, give this one a pass.

11-24-2015 - 1 game in and so far I love it!  It's not as complex or involved as some hidden traitor games like BSG, but it's fast, easy to play, easy to teach, quick to learn, and creates stress for both the people who ARE traitors as well as those who are NOT.  Great flipping game that I look forward to playing many more times!

RATING: 8
5 Player. Brilliant party game due to the accusations and suspicions about who is infected and thanks to the dice being more negative than positive, even non-infected players looked guilty. However, in the 2 games we played, it was too easy for the infected to win as the dice went against the non-infected members and the game may have been lost without the infected crew sabotaging. Nice and quick, both games around 40mins.

RATING: 8
[4/13/2012] This is as the title entails, "Battlestar Galactica Express".  It plays briskly compared with BSG and offers the similar flavor of suspicion and crisis management issues that the Fantasy Flight edition has.  I think it is a bit more difficult to find or "out" a cyclon in hiding.

[Update: 4/16/2015] The theme has now been reimplemented since my initial 2012 print-and-play of it.  It definitely has that Battlestar Galactica "feel" of attempting to detect who the traitor(s) is/are but the game plays much faster than BSG.  At its core, it's mainly driven by dice management, rather than cards (like BSG).  It's a lot of hooting and hollering when accusations fly in this game of hidden roles!  Either way you slice it, the dice can still kill your team.  ;-D

This is most definitely not the BSG killer the fanboys rave about when they talk about BSG Express and this game in particular. I was really hoping to get a game that played like BSG but in much more streamlined fashion. Maybe that is what this is, and that really isn't what I want at all, because the whole time I was playing this game I was wishing I was playing BSG. Its like hearing the copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a great song. Its not new, its just makes you want to hear the original. This game removes all of the richness and complexity of BSG which turns each game into a television series unto itself and just replaces it with with generic mechanics that aren't even all that difficult to choose between on your turn. I'll pass. Viva la BSG.

Battlestar Galactica in kurz/schnell und mit Würfeln.
Ich war der infizierte (Zylon), was bei diesem Spiel von vornherein bekannt ist (es gibt keine Schläferphase).
Es reduziert meiner Meinung nach sehr gut BSG aufs wesentliche, auch wenn ich den Glücksfaktor recht hoch finde.
Solange man nicht enttarnt ist, sollte man sich als Zylon auch nicht aufdecken, selbst wenn es noch so gut aussieht. Ich hätte nur noch einen Marker auf der Lebensversorgung gebraucht und habe mich aufgedeckt. Dadurch hatten die anderen "leichtes" Spiel. Als verdeckte Person hätte ich viel mehr Einfluss üben können, als aufgedeckte Person habe ich nur schwache Aktionsmöglichkeiten.
Mir hat es echt Spaß gemacht. Müsste es aber noch häufiger spielen um mir eine endgültige Meinung zu bilden. Besser als BSG wird es aber wohl nie werden, dafür aber wesentlich kürzer!

Someone at a gaming event I attended was selling Dark Moon, a game I’d had my eye on, for a really good price. It’s a retheme of “BSG Express”, which was itself a fan-made dice adaptation of the Battlestar Galactica boardgame. I’m not a huge fan of BSG, but more for the length and sameness than the central idea behind it. I wanted to jump on that sale price but felt I should give it a try first. I found some others who were happy to teach it and played a game. I was one of the Infected, and played cool for a while. At one point I selected an event card which could have given the game away and was disastrous for the humans, but it was because I was completely inept, not because I was trying to kill them all. When we Infected revealed, we had the humans on the ropes, but they wriggled out and won. Stupid humans. I had a good time and ended up buying that copy.

I know that this started out as BSG Lite, but it scratches completely different itches from BSG for me. It's much more luck based and requires more deduction than BSG because there's more direct interaction between players. I like that a good can always Lone Wolf back for the win, even though it rarely happens. And I appreciate that there's more information up front about what's required for mission and what the possible outcomes are of various tasks.

All in all, I definitely prefer BSG because the theme is less of a factor here, but it's definitely great in many circumstances were BSG isn't a good call, particularly when you're more pressed for time.

This game was originally a streamlined Battlestar Galactica. It works fine as that but I miss launching the CAP, the stress of making sure the civilian ships are safe, and the other decisions you make as the President and Admiral.

Dark Moon is a pretty nice hidden traitor game that plays in about half the time of a game of BSG. Very much with its original BSG Express theme, you can sense the theme ripped from the game with the new Dark Moon setting, but anyone playing the game who's familiar with BSG will know what it is. Solid mechanics, lack of player power, the game is tense and interesting until the end but just not as good a sthe old BSG.

Excellent traitor type game.  It is quick, with the same successful traitor mechanics of games like Dead of Winter and BSG.  Allows for surprises all the way to the end (in one match the uninfected thought they had won and as they were celebrating they discovered that the infected had won).  The theme and graphics work.  It does not have a strong IP like BSG but still enjoyable.  If one had room for only one traitor game in one's library this is definitely a strong contender

The game seems quite difficult even if there are no cylons.
This is problematic because the cylons basically have no need to sabotage anything. The cylons do not have to play their role. The biggest draw of this game for me is the fact that there could be a cylon among the group. But to necessitate a search for a cylon, the cylon should have incentive to play in a manner that makes him questionable as a cylon.

Nonetheless, I will need to reread the rules and get in a few more plays before I can confirm my feelings.

Fun! Although the game has quite a lot in common with BSG, I find the experience is very different. Dark Moon is simpler and faster, but it's less of an "experience". It felt like there was a bigger dependency on luck, which is fine for a short game, but it doesn't have the legs to support the slow burn and tension of BSG. I like 'em both for different reasons.

I've played a lot of traitor games, and this is the closest any of them come to a pure expression of the genre. In many ways, I regard this now as *the* traitor game.

If you want a tense story-driven experience with a traitor, play DoW.

If you want a traitor game, play this.

game is too imbalanced because of the probability of + to - dice roll, IMO.  As opposed to having black dice be two +'s of higher value, would rather have lesser value but 50/50 odds over 66/33. Game is decent, but the imbalance kills it and makes me not want to ever play it.

It's fast, fun and treacherous. Captures the essence of a traitor game but distills it to pure random rolling bliss. Biggest problem is the component design, which looks both tacky and tacked on. Thematically very thin, I prefer the Battlestar Galactica theme. BUT even then, even if you don't like the retro components, the experience is still ridiculously good.

I would give this a 10 were it not for the crappy rulebook, the shitty box and cardboard case (map doesn't fit anywhere?!) and otherwise boring and drab component design and art. But the gameplay mechanics are just awesome and perfect.

this game is even better than BSG Express was... this game has it all:
It has the suspicion, drama, the lying and the accusations, the hidden roll and selection of dice to use, the player powers, the Infected reveal powers, etc, etc, etc, all beautifully done and mastered. and it plays in 1 hour or less!!

We played with 5 players and I hear it works very well with all different number of players, can't attest to that myself because I only played with 5 but I can see it being true due to the way they scaled the game to the different number of players/infected/difficulty of the tasks.

I'm making a long term call but I'll be very surprised if this game won't be in my Top 10 games of 2015 (yes, it says it's a 2011 game because of the BSG Express game, but this is a 2015 game)... there are still a lot of games to be played but if this will not be in the top 10 it will be pretty close!

A fairly distilled and streamlined hidden traitor-social game.

Every other comment on here says Dark Moon is a 'Battlestar Galactica light' and that makes sense. The core of that particular game- having to make group efforts to clear tasks whilst hidden traitors try and screw it up- is very similar to Dark Moon. However there's much less fluff and bloat here, making it comparatively simplistic. If anything its a bit too simple, and the game can sometimes feel like its ended just as its started to get interesting.

As with many games of this type your game group is pivotal to the amount of enjoyment you will get during play. With a good group the threats, suspicions and paranoia will be fun and engaging as you try to determine who's good and who's not. If your group does not suit this kind of game then it will probably just suck.

I have enjoyed the games I've played so far, mainly due to the excellent group dynamics this kind of game causes within my particular group. The only issue I can level with it is the whole thing is often over so fast winning as the traitors is very difficult with no clear optimum time to reveal yourself to the good guys.

I wtched some friends play a game (they were midgame when I came). It looks like it has all the fun of BSG without the time commitment. But there seems to be a lot more luck involved (dice), making you suspissious at the worst time (can be fun, can be frustrating).

It is a pity that stronghold could not get the rights to theme this game in the Battlestar Galactica setting.
That said, this game really does streamline the entire traitor style game down into a one hour play. The use of dice is very well thought out and a bad roll can target anyone as the traitor!
It just works! 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Fantastic hidden traitor game that uses dice instead of cards  to sabotage missions and dice don't always get the result you want. Really enjoy this game and it's really hard to be 100 percent sure who is infected based on bad die rolls.

The tension in this game is immense and you are constantly throwing allegations back and forth at everyone.

If you enjoy resistance and want a bit more of a game then this is it. Very enjoyable light- medium game.

This game is excellent! It does more than just combine BSG elements into a more manageable and streamlined system, it's also simply more fun and interesting to me. It's more fast paced, the dice system isn't a cheap replacement but an IMPROVEMENT in a number of different ways over BSG. The components are well designed as far as user interface but lackluster aesthetically. The game itself though has a wonderful elegance and the fun factor is super high. So far, it seems to scale well. In terms of replay ability and appeal to gamers, this is one of the best hidden traitor games there is. Shadows over Camelot is much prettier and has more accessibility to non gamer's and more full coop variation and so forth, but as far as tension based on a hidden traitor and replayability based on clever design, I like this one the most and certainly MORE than Dead of Winter or BSG proper. Excellent Game!

On one hand, the player-specific special abilities add variety, there's very little downtime due to constant involvement, and there's generally lots of tension.  On the other hand, it's entirely possible that the game will end before you get your first turn.  The amount of luck involved, particularly in the Shields system, can make victory rather unfulfilling for the infected/"traitor" player(s).

The first game was marred by a lot of looks to the rule book, but I remember a scene in the movie Rounders that exemplified my first experience with Dark Moon:

"Listen, if you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table then you ARE the sucker."

I was the sucker. I ended up giving the infected the commander card and sending an uninfected into quarantine. It was a really fun experience, and one of the best traitor games I've played.

I'll need to play more to get a better feel for the game, but I enjoyed my first game. My rating could go up.

Gioco che ricorda incredibilmente Battlestar Galactica, ma un tantino più snello e governato dai dati. Per il resto siamo sempre lì, un paio di traditori contro tutti i buoni che cercano di portare a termine le missioni senza far abbassare troppo i livelli dei vari comparti. Gioco di bluff e deduzione, di tradimenti e accuse. Gioco carino che con l'aumentare del numero di giocatori diventa più interessante e avvincente.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This game has been on my radar for a while, back when it was still BSG Express and I finally go tot play. It is a hidden traitor game where you are handcuffed by the dice you roll. Dice are rolled in secret and there is a 4 in 6 chance your roll will fail, but try explaining to the group that you aren't purposely tanking a mission. 

That is the whole game, but the rules surrounding the game play are not the most intuitive, there were a lot of cases where we needed to consult the rule book. I know this would improve with repeated play, but this is by no means a streamlined experience. 

Also Stronghold couldn't secure the BSG license which is a huge negative for me. The game goes from being highly thematic to a generic space setting. I know there is nothing Stronghold could do, but it's to bad the game lost so much of it's flavor. The other side of the coin is that Stronghold did a great job producing the game, the art is great, if generic, and the components are top notch. In the end I'm not sure how much I enjoyed the game, even if it wasn't a learning game I'm not sure the game play holds up for 90+ minutes. In comparison I felt like Room 25, another hidden traitor game I played at the con, played quicker and was more intuitive. I'd definitely like to play Dark Moon again and see how it improves now that we have a lot of the rules down. [/i]

RATING: 8.5
So I guess this started out as a fanmade PnP version of Battlestar Galactica, until they decided to make a full game of it. And, to be honest, this streamlined version succeeds where BSG fails. The main reason why I avoid Battlestar is that the game takes way too long to play for not that much fun. So Dark Moon boils all of that overstuffed nonsense into one fleet, easy game. The turns and decisions made by players are quicker without sacrificing the fun and intrigue of a full game of Battlestar. It's a great game for many: those who don't want to play a four-to-five hour game of Battlestar and those who are looking for something more and enjoy social deduction games like Resistance or Werewolf. It's always been a lot of fun whenever I've played this game.

The jury is still out after 1 play.  I felt that by the time I got the hang of things, we had pretty much determined who the traitor was and already had him in quarantine so I didn't have time to experiment with sound strategic moves and intelligent deduction.  I'd like to try it again with my newfound experience.  It was fun and I see the similarities to Battlestar Galactica which is a plus IMO.

Very solid game that takes BSG and dilutes it down to its core. Now I do worry that you don't really have enough time to sow doubt, but the last couple games I played, I had a really hard time figuring out who was good and bad. The die rolling mechanic is brilliant.

Only time will tell for sure, but this completely does away with BSG for me.

RATING: 6
It's a smaller game similar to Battlestar Galactica with traitors ("infected").  I like how the characters all had something to do, all had risk with rolling dice and could have negatives to mask traitors, and the shorter game length compared to BSG.

Unfortunately the characters seemed to have uninteresting powers, sometimes unused, and didn't have the tension of finding the traitor compared to other traitor games.

Bleh. Don't know why, but this always fell flat. The dice rolling mechanism just felt.. Bleh. A bit too randomn. Sometimes the bad guys were super obvious, other times someone happened to roll poorly, so it was more difficult. Nope.. It just didn't grab me.

It says on the box that this was 'formerly known as 'BSG Express'. Despite that, it is presumably copyright and trademark restrictions that mean that there is no reference in this game to players being Cylons. Instead they are 'infected' - so think John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. Game is pretty straightforward and plays well - a bit like a cross between 'The Captain is Dead' and 'Homeland'.

[One Play: tentative rating: 8] Played the BSG Express version of the game. Wasn't sure of all the rules, reading as we played, but we still enjoyed it. I hope to give this another run soon so that the interpersonal dynamics can be the focus as opposed to learning the rules.

Played the Dark Moon version a few times now.  Definitely a great game. The rules are easier to follow than the BSG Express PnP version. While I miss the BSG theme, the new theme works and the 3-7 player range is a welcome addition.

From the Drive-Thru review, if the game is playable under an hour and just as well with 3 and up to 7, the Resistance days may be over, because I feel there is a lot more variety in the play, the narrative is stronger although I suspect because of the rolling dice behind a screen (such a contrast when there is possible cheating with the mechanism yet we have to rely on everyone being trustworthy with their dice results) there is less concrete information to deduce with. I suspect one issue is the negative vibe of lying, heated accusations and counteraccusations which won't sit well with some players. What really appeals is this seems to be high drama in a box, which you are in it and so who needs to watch TV?

A fantastic streamlined, but nevertheless complete, version of its big brother game, BSG. If the theme would have been the same, I would have given it a "10", so it is a "9". Paranoia, accusations, tension, emotions ... it's all there! Highly recommended!

A couple of plays later, I found out that 5 players is the perfect number, and I re-rated it up to 10. It's definitely my personal game of the year. Great, great, great!

Rethemed BSG Express, which was a much-needed streamlining of BattleStar Galactica. It can be very swingy, so even if you feel you're out of it (either team), you may not be just yet. Decent. Preferable to BSG for me, as it's considerably shorter.

8 - I've played a handful of games of this and I really like it, but the rules are not terribly clear and it took a while to figure things out.  Even though we were able to sit down and play, the important information that we missed basically crippled the delicate balance.

*****
7.5 - The game flows well but it doesn't feel grand or epic. The major pro for the game it that it moves well and plays well but it often feels that you are beholden to the dice.  Maybe more plays will adjust this feeling.

RATING: 3
This game benefits so much from being fast. But like New Salem and BtC, lightness is not some intrinsically good property. Just because a game plays quickly doesn't mean it's better than a game that plays slower. Of course, I find that BSG plays SO SLOW and I don't even like BSG (the show), but this has so few moving pieces, it really does nothing for me. Lately I've been playing a lot of lighter games that I can enjoy because they end so quickly, but they just don't do enough in that time.

I think that these sorts of games, both in terms of hidden roles/social deduction and light play, just don't do anything for me.

RATING: 4
I can understand how many will find this interesting and fun to play. But for a few reasons, I find this game to be pretty meh.
--I don't like the mechanic that can force a uninfected player to appear infected just because of a bad roll where they were forced to submit a harmful die. This is my issue with Secret Hitler as well. I just don't like that type of mechanic as I think it is unfun to become suspected through no fault of your own, and it can really mess up the entire table's deduction as well which means the game can be heavily determined not because of the player's decisions but because of the random nature of the dice
--I don't like how few decisions there are on a player's turn, especially if the control center thing is getting damaged which limits the action choices of a player. Many times I felt like it was obvious what I had to try to do on my turn, and simply had to roll and hope it would work out
--The entire game came down to the single roll of the die and that seems like it could happen fairly often. That's just not something I like in games, especially ones that take an hour or more to play. 

Overall I will be fine never playing this game again, although if someone really wanted to I would play again as it's an alright game. I just would far prefer to be playing something like Dead of Winter for a similar but much better experience of a hidden traitor game in around an hour or so.

Still trying to find the perfect player count for this one. Ive played with 7 and 6 players, and both times the uninfected had a runaway victory. I really enjoy the opportunity for bluffing in this game. Got to love when an uninfected player gets quarantined for legitimately rolling terrible, but can't show his teammates. I would love to see an expansion that started the game with only one infected, but the infection could spread. It wouldn't have made sense with the Battlestar theme, but now it would be perfect!

UPDATE AFTER 10 PLAYS:
This game has gotten better with every play. There is a surprising amount of depth to the social deduction and strategy in the game. I keep discovering new ways to play. I've come to really appreciate hidden loyalty games that provide ways to play like a bad guy without totally condeming you. Dark Moon definitely gives ample opportunities to stay in the game and make clever choices.

Currently one of my favorite games to play. Definitely my favorite traitor mechanic game that I've played. Love how the dice mechanic works and really can make anyone seem like the traitor and how the game can drastically swing from favoring one side to the other. Always keeps a high tension level. If I have any issues with it, it would be that teaching the game is a bit difficult as there are many facets to the game so it can take a bit to get new players on board. Fortunately, it is a quick enough after a little experience (box says and hour & a 1/2, I say closer to 2 hours) That it can usually make it's way back to the table. Also, in my opinion, there isn't a better game that supports this high of a player count (7).

I like Battlestar Galactica a lot, in a tight game w/o expansions. Then, BSG is managable, but still takes a long time. Just like in BSG, in Dark Moon there are loyal people and traitors (here infected). 

BSG express was developed to trim the game down further. In it, the cards from BSG are replaced with dice. However, the dice are bad.. 2/3 chance on negative numbers. Each player gets a set of dice to assign during their turn. In their turn, they first collect up to their limit (usually 4) dice from the common supply. Red dice are 'weak', with lower positive numbers. The black dice are 'strong', and have higher positive numbers. Then, they can try to perform a repair, work on a task or give someone else two actions.
If you repair you roll 3 of your dice in secret (hidden behind your player screen) and assign one die publically. If it's positive you succeed. It is possible to lie, so if you're a traitor.. you'd ignore the success and put forth a negative number.

Then, you have to face an event, which come in two versions. Tasks in which the group collectively has to come up with a certain value of rolled dice results. If you manage, you pass and the tasks you aim to complete are one step closer to completion. If you fail, bad stuff happens. If a player passes in this part of the game they get to retrieve two dice from the supply.

I really liked Dark Moon. It's good, it's quick. I am very much impressed with this design. The theme is lacking a little. You notice the BSG tension w/o the flavor and theme. the Thing is an ok theme, but this game should STILL be BSG express.

This is BSG with the theme completely stripped out, since all the cards and situations are abstracted with dice. So it blows if you play BSG for the theme (as nearly everybody does; it keeps you going when all the cylons are revealed; if you want to play the mechanics, go with The Resistance or The Devil's Castle).

Here, you spike a skill check by rolling all your dice secretly, then contributing a negative die publicly (since you have to put in at least 1 if you rolled), putting on your best poker face and saying, "Sorry guys, this was the best one I rolled."

Definitely fast (30-45min), but another problem: this, like BSG, plays best with 5 (so you have 2 cylons), but then you definitely go for BSG if you can squeak in the extra time. So the only situation you use it for is 5-player and < 1 hour, that's it. That's incredibly niche.

It avoids competition with The Resistance and The Devil's Castle, but it goes head-to-head with Shadow Hunters. And this game isn't winning any head-to-head battles.

Nice, shortened version of BSG. Not really telling that epic stories as big BSG, but does some nice thematic traitor gaming in 60-90 minutes.

Cons: Game session quality can vary wider than with BSG (where most experiences are long, sometimes dragging a bit, but epic) - sometimes it's quite dull or too fast without nothing really happening. Not the greatest design virtue, but can be forgiven as playtime is short enough to allow for a second or third run.

Not usually a fan of hidden role/deduction games since I'm awful at them - but this was pretty good.  I was non-infected in my only play and we had a very easy time .. would have to see the game again to really give an accurate opinion.

RATING: 5
Hmmm. Interesting. I think this game is successful in extracting the paranoia and distrust from Battlestar Galactica proper and disposing of all of the "extra" game around it, but that's not something I'm personally in the market for.

I love Battlestar Galactica because of how good the game surrounding the traitor element is. This game removes:

* The Strong Theme and Setting
* The Opportunity for Clever Plays (many diverse ways to sabotage or help humanity)
* The Depth

and leaves a straightforward dice game, which basically boils down to "do you trust the person rolling the dice or not"

And then once you solve that puzzle, all that's left is a pure dice game that offers little control

Based on comments I've seen about BSG, I think this might be exactly what some people want -- people who also prefer games like Mafia, Werewolf, and The Resistance to an epic traitor game like BSG.

For me, this game finds itself in a weird middle-ground -- more interesting, but longer than the Resistance with a less meaningful, decisive end-game, but far less interesting than real BSG.

So basically, too long to be a quick filler traitor game, and that makes it compete too directly with the real BSG -- where it gets absolutely CLOBBERED

I do find it enjoyable though... in a vacuum, but between the one-two punch of real BSG and shorter traitor games I will never crave playing this game (might play if others really want to)

(3 Design + 2 Enjoyment)

Thematically "Dark Moon" is a step above the rest. Everything from the console style board, with faux video screens, the characters, the John Carpeter's "The Thing" inspiration, I love it all.

However...

I want to like this game so much more than I do. If there was some way to mitigate the utter randomness it would be fantastic, but all you really do is roll dice and hope for the best. Even the "good" dice have half of their sides as negative values. This has caused games where one round of lousy rolls have lost the game, without Infected interference.

As frustrating as the dice can be, there's something about this game that keeps bringing me back. 

It's short enough, and because rules are simple enough, and the player count variable enough, and because it's so thematic, I think this is a great gateway game, and an excellent introduction to co-operative games.

RATING: 7.5
PnP copy.  In a word, fantastic.  I honestly felt like I was playing BSG -- the mechanics are quite different, but all the paranoia and desperation is still there.  It's almost the freaking same feeling ... in two hours less time.  Fantastic design!  My favorite thing about it is that when you're rolling dice and really wanting to roll well, and you don't, and you HAVE to play -- the suspicion is overwhelming.  It's just pure beauty and we had a great time with the first play.  I hope I hope I hope this can see professional printing one day.  *Update* - my hopes and dreams have been realized.  I played the new copy of Dark Moon yesterday.  It is good, and I enjoyed the play.  I can't say whether or not how much staying power it has, but I will tell you that it knocks BSG out of the water.  I expect to get plenty of plays out of the new version and congrats to the designer!

Only one play here, and the Infected tried to lay low early, which was not good, as the game was over too quickly, which made for a really uninteresting play. Now knowing that, I'd like to try it one more time, to see if as the Infected they could really wreak havoc early on and make for an interesting game. I still wonder, though, as it seems that rather than a hidden traitor element, you just end up with two teams and that just takes the fun out of it.

This game gave us a similar feeling as Dead of Winter. The paranoia in DoW comes from the personal objectives and the possibility that there might be a traitor. In Dark Moon you know the traitor(s) might be the guy/gal sitting next to you so you observe carefully every action the other players take until the very end. Fantastic, tense, game.

All of the paranoia and hilarity from Battlestar Galactica but plays in 1/3 of the time and supports more players.  Swapping the deterministic cards for the dice rolls makes it easier to point the finger at innocent players.  A masterpiece of derivative design.

This has quickly become one of my favorite hidden faction games. I'm a fan of the space theme and the dice rolling mechanic adds an unpredictable element that I never get tired of. Whether you are one of the hidden traitors or not, the dice can sometimes force you to into a certain course of action that you don't want to do.
The mechanics of the game allow for a greater amount of distrust and coercion during the game which is why they play them in the first place! Very good for a group of 5-7 players that are familiar with each other.

Dark Moon is a fun game marred by poor box design.  The packaging was very poorly thought out.  The too-large box has little in the way of organization – several decks of cards will be slopping around loose, as will the board, the rule book, and a double-fistful of chits.  Good luck preventing the manual from getting mangled and mashed.

The box, and the manual, should have been the same size as the folded board.

Which is a shame, because the components are otherwise pretty well done.

Side Note: It's idiotic that Dark Moon is the same listing as BSG Express.  It's a re-implementation, but they're quite different.

While it mechanically holds together, there is nothing in Dark Moon that makes me want to keep playing it or to get it to the table again. Is it better than BSG? Yes. But the dice mechanism doesn't hold up for me and removes choice (to add in intrigue). It didn't work for me.

Dark Moon is less BSG lite and more Werewolf in space.  The artwork evokes an entire genre of 70s sci-fi cinema, but that's nearly all of the theme provided by the publisher. The game has the usual slew of repetitive tasks like every other semi co-op, but here they're executed with bland, themeless dice and brief, flavorless card text.  The information used to detect infected players is plain-view. Dark Moon was designed primarily to be fast, but it fails to transport the players anywhere at all.  Underproduced.

I played this as BSG Express.  It's basically Battlestar Galactica the Dice Game.  It plays quicker than Battlestar, but it sacrifices some theme and interaction in order to do it.  Also, it feels a little more luck based that Battlestar.  I would be happy to play it again, but if I have time, I would rather play Battlestar Galactica.

Seems solid so far.

I was initially concerned that the dice would be too limiting, but there is usually enough probability that you can feel comfortable rolling to try to help your team. The dice also make for a lot of tension. Sometimes you need just the right number to come up, and sometimes you have to decide if you want to keep rolling to try to increase your success number because you suspect the next player may be infected and they'll try to tank the task.

The rulebook isn't the best. After playing a couple of times and then reading on the forums, though, I have a solid understanding of the game. So they're also not the worst rules.

Really unique design that does a lot with just some dice, some cards, and a few tokens basically.

You need at least five players so there are at least two infected. This gives the infected team more options and makes the game more interesting.

My second play ever went even better than the first. I think I really like this game. I never felt the desire to own BSG because I always felt like it was too long for what it delivered. Especially when there was always The Resistance: Avalon to play. But the one thing that always bummed me out was that I wished I could have a fuller board-game experience. Enter Dark Moon. It's exactly what I've always wanted in a game like this. I love the way the roll of the dice happen. They create a wonderful opportunity for deception and bluffing. They also tend to cast a lot of suspicion in every direction, making it easier for the Infected to blend in. 

I'm going to be picking up a copy of this game. For sure.

::UPDATE::
I sold it. Ha! After playing it a couple more times, I realized it gets very repetitive. Every game comes back to the same thing. Players tell the same lies, and other players make the same accusations. The Resistance: Avalong remaind the king of this genre.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Mikael

Why we culled it: One of my guiding principles in this new push to downsize was to make my library into more of a community asset - I have a lot of great games, many of which overlap to some degree. By sending these games to homes that would love them, I still retain the ability to play them through my friends, but the games themselves take on more life in the hands of people who can use them more. Here's a perfect example.

Dark Moon literally began its existence as "BSG Express" - a streamlined version of Battlestar Galactica. We love BSG and play it often. We also play a lot of The Resistance. To me, Dark Moon does a good job of bridging that gap - it is significantly more complex than The Resistance, which eschews all of the "game" trappings for pure social-deduction bliss. It is also, as intended, a very streamlined take on BSG, lacking a lot of the depth for the trade-off of better accessibility. It is a great design! But it is also pretty redundant for my collection, so the opportunities to play it where it would outclass the other two games was remote. 

Mikael, on the other hand, owns neither game and has a robust gamer circle of his own. Through him, it gets plenty of play, and I occasionally join those sessions.  This makes Dark Moon one of my better success stories, as it is my token example of a situation that is working out exactly as intended. Good times.

My rating is for BSG: Express, but it got renamed.
I wanted to like it, but seemed to be nearly impossible for Cylons to win and the Dais contacts were never a threat.  Humans can roll a 4 for distance twice (happened in our game) by the 2nd full round.
I am interested in looking at changes Dark Moon made though as I like the idea of it.

RATING: 6
I've always had an interest in Battlestar Galactica, but knew that it ran way too long for me. I had heard that there was a quicker version called BSG Express, and apparently this is pretty much that.

The game is a semi-coop social deduction game. Your team is on a space station that has been infected. Two of the five players are no longer human and are working to sabotage the space station. There's all sorts of bad stuff than can happen and your team has to work to keep everything from going to hell... while knowing that some of your team is only pretending to help. Players get dice, which are mostly negative values with a few positive values. Every round you get to do one thing and then you're presented with two tasks, one of which you have to accept for the team.

Most of the time you're rolling dice to help do stuff. The challenge of the game is that you can never tell whether someone is revealing a bad die because that's all they had, or if they're deliberately sabotaging the project.

In our play, the humans pretty much had a cakewalk. They got great events and had awesome rolls on their tasks. They breezed through most of the game, succeeding on almost every task and only running into a brief hiccup on the very last step of the game. That gave the barest hint of how painful things could have been. I'm not sure if this was a particularly representative play of the game. I'd bet that most games are going to be a lot more of a struggle than we saw.

What I like about social deduction games is the deduction. Once it became apparent that the humans had the upper hand in our game, our infected revealed themselves. At which point, all the interesting social deduction parts of the game disappeared. Without the mystery and the constant doublethinking, the game became a back and forth bashfest where most of the decisions were straightforward. You did the best you could for your team and there was no reason not to. I found this part of the game to be a slog. I only really enjoy all the tasks and events in the game insofar as they give you information about the players and whether they're truly participating or not. Without that, they simply becomes a chore to determine which team wins. It's all very straightforward, and frankly boring. But again, if things had gone worse for the humans, the infected would have stayed hidden and the social deduction would have persisted much longer.

One of the selling points of this game is that it is a lot shorter than BSG which has a play time of 4 hours. I can't imagine keeping my interest in this type of game for that long. Even though this was considerably shorter, it still felt a little long for what it was. Honestly, when I think about Dark Moon, I compare it to something like The Resistance, which hits a lot of the same points that I like in social deduction games with a lot less of the fiddly framework. I'm not sure that what DM adds really justifies the extra playtime. And I'm afraid that if our game hadn't of been so lopsided towards the humans, the playtime would have run longer than I would have cared for.

Oh boy, does this drastically improve on BSG. Most of the bells and whistles, finishes up between 1-2 hours, and lots of tension and arguing and betrayal. A real gem of a game.

If there's one problem, however, it's that the base game suffers from being too easy for the un-infected without at least 2 of the variant rules to help the Infected (First is Last, Telepathic Infected). Even then, the math is still a bit too much in the un-infected players favor for malfunction tasks, but this is fixed in the (excellent) expansion.

I didn't feel like the options regarding deception were interesting. There's not in-game motivation to contribute anything besides positive values, so it felt (to me) like the only real thing you do as an unrevealed infected was to claim you only rolled negatives. There's no possible other motivations to explain, no nuances that might be there if contributions weren't as overt.

I've been a bit wary about this game because cold, hard, face to face lying is hard for me.  Though I haven't had to play as the Infected yet.  I have really enjoyed it, and I think it succeeds at capturing all of the tense feel of Battlestar Galactica in around 35% of the time.  I certainly do miss the BSG theme, and some of the built up drama.  For a bluffing/lying game though, I think leaning towards the shorter side is a smart move.

For me, I've played a ton of hidden role type games and they either feel too simple and too focused on bluffing (Resistance), or too drawn out and convoluted (BSG).   Co-Ops in general are something I don't normally enjoy.  I think this game hits a perfect mix.  A game that requires such overt bluffing shouldn't take more than 90 minutes I feel.  This game is just short enough that every minute is enjoyable and tense.

BSG Express PnP version.
Okay attempt at porting BSG to an express dice format. Seems like this would be best at 5 players and not worth playing at any other counts. The game itself functions well but there isn't much story as the crisis dice are the only narrative. So in the end it lacks flavor and the gameplay feels a bit flat in that you do the same things on your turn, over and over again from the beginning to the end. The only exception of course being when the Cylon(s) are unmasked.

RATING: 8
Great game. Probably should have voiced my suspicions regarding the Second Man, as chosing a card that requires a loyalty demo of one dice give away is tailor made for the infected. On top of this, I was implicated by the same player so it became clear then but I had no dice to call a vote. I though I'd flunked the fatigued gamble on the commander - 1 in 6 are good odds! - but once the card types are known, it will be harder to claim it was the best of a bad bunch....Thanks to everyone involved.

Dark Moon is a middle ground between the overly long behemoth that is BSG and sub-hour stripped down games like The Resistance. Personally I don't care for thematic immersion or chrome so I ultimately prefer Resistance to Dark Moon (and avoid BSG like the plague), but I think DM does what it sets out to do, for those looking for a little extra without the time commitment of BSG.

Space survival with a hidden traitor. Die rolls can prevent you doing what you want, and make the deduction more difficult.

I think this one does the traitor mechanic quite well.  While living on a distant moon, it seems fairly likely that all manner of stuff would go wrong [i]without[/i] a saboteur lurking around, and I felt like the distribution on the dice represented that idea well.  Bad things are going to happen, and oftentimes even the good guys are only given a choice between the lesser of two evils.  If you're the traitor, it's not too hard to justify your terrible decisions.  

Unfortunately, this one really solidified for me that I just don't like traitor games.  I'm flat out terrible at them and can't keep a straight face to save my life.

I had very high expectations of this one.
I really appreciate the quickness of the game, but this also proved to be its weakness. The dice make the game shorter than its consorts, but also take a lot of control away, leaving you at the mercy of luck. The traitor aspect is there and actually works to a certain degree, but because you, in many cases, dont have the choice of really playing your role, the tension gets diluted and the whole thing falls apart into a slightly boring and frustrating affair. Luckily it doesn't take up too much of your time.
This kind of game does not merit from short sessions. It NEEDS to be substantial, so that your actions actually mean something in the story that unfolds while playing the game.

My play is of the BSG Express Print-and-Play. It does a nice job of capturing the basic functionality of the Battlestar Galactica Board Game while keeping the play time down under an hour. For the most part, it hits all the same notes, with players cooperating to hit target numbers on crises, with a hidden "cylon" player doing their best to sabotage those efforts.

Part of speeding up play from the original is moving to dice instead of cards. The dice are interesting, because they generate far more negative results than positive. This gives cylon players quite a bit of room to hide, as they can often tank a roll and simply claim innocence through the laws of probability.

So does this replace BSG? No. It's not even close. Removing the cards takes away so much flavor that you end up feeling like you are just playing tug of war over the game's three cylon victory conditions, every turn being two steps forward and one to three steps back, depending on how the dice roll. This makes it feel a little one dimensional and slightly frustrating for both the human players and the cylon.

Still, it's a solid game for what it is and a great option as a travel game. If you treat it as it's own thing and manage expectations accordingly, you'll have some fun with it.

Fairly quick hidden identity game that's not just shouting at other players. Although you can if you want to. Suspicion all round in this one and with a play time of about 60 mins it doesn't outstay it's welcome. The hidden dice rolling can really screw you over, but not in a 'bad' way. Even if you're not infected and are forced to play rubbish dice that just increases the suspicion even more.

As billed, it is a streamlined BSG.  But, unfortunately, it streamlined a lot of the fun out of the game.  Also, it just can't compete with Resistance Avalon as a pure coop/traitor game.

Unfortunately flawed, it still plays incredibly quick and gives experienced Cylon players a tough game.

I hope this one gets further refined.

Dark Moon is a slightly more advanced social deduction game than your typical party type game. It was developed as a shorter version of battle star galactica, but personally I haven't played BSG yet to compare. I can say that the game is interesting and if you enjoy social deduction this is a unique spin on genre.

I had my doubts about Dark Moon because of the low BGG rating, but I got it in a package deal and tried it out. I can see how some plays could be more subject to luck than others, but the first experience of our group was positive. After the game ended, we talked about our session for at least 15-20 minutes and agreed that everyone had fun, which is the most important thing.

Battlestar Galactica dice roller traitor game. Complete with DRADIS, spinning up the FTL's, lost hope, ship to ship combat, stretched thin of resources. Bluff and deduction ferreting out the human posing cylons. "YOU ARE NOT A CYLON"

UPDATE: Repackaged into a sci-fi space mining outpost where some of the crew become violent and destructive from contracting an alien virus. This has a Dead of Winter feel only this game does a better job at forcing out the betrayers with a suspicion vote track and diabolical event tasks. I don't like privacy screens generally but they add a lot of bluff and uncertainty to the dice placement which is great. I also like the quick play time.

This is like The Resistance, with some twists. There are some more options, the "spies" doesnt know each other, and there is more backstabbing. It does the job well, but I dont think it can compete with Resistance regards to tension and fun-factor. Still a good game that I want to try out more.

Compered to Battle Star Galactica this is not as good a hidden tratior game. The game time is an hour witch is good but I feel you have very limited option as the traitor to do damage without getting find out.

RATING: 5.5
A good middle depth hidden traitor game with mandatory voting periods! The dice rolls hidden behind screens work against everyone because of the odds so everyone is thought of being the traitor or one of the traitors. However, that is also a downside because unlucky rolls are common. 

There are hidden role games like this that play faster and better.

RATING: 6
Battlestar Galactica lite. Less actions available and use dice instead of cards. The dice can force good players to do bad and bad players to do good against their will.

There's not enough actions to make the game interesting, and the hidden traitors seem underpowered.

This is a very good social deduction game. Sadly they leave me very stressed out, but I do enjoy the additional board game elements, how it's not just sitting around bitching, but you also must try to accomplish certain tasks.

The theme left me scratching my head though. This must be some alternate universe or something, given that we're mining Titan the dark moon of Saturn, but we still have a dot matrix printer!? I also don't understand why you cannot attempt to lock up an Infected which has revealed themselves as such, that seems oddly strange. Did they become mist or something? Perhaps I should read the rules for myself, I hope that both of these questions are answered, as they would up my enjoyment of the game.

RATING: 8
Lighter, faster and less fiddly than BSG or Dead of Winter but still much more game than Werewolf or Resistance.  That seems like a perfect sweet spot and after two games I'm pretty sure this will be my favorite social deduction game.  I might need to tweak the difficulties a bit based on some suggestions from the rulebook, but we certainly like expensive voting in our group.  Just not sure if that makes it too hard on the good guy team...

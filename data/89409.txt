For a quick 2p game I much prefer Yomi or Flash Duel. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The aesthetics of BattleCON are too busy for me. I can see the genre, but the manga-ish vibe doesn't feel as coherent to me as Yomi, even if a bit more mature. I tend to shy away from sandbox-y,anything goes, worlds and prefer something working within restraints. 

I found the mechanisms of this game surprisingly hard to understand. Theoretically, they feel smooth - combining the stance with the move is thematic and fascinating; it just takes a long time to work out how to do these things meaningfully. There are so many characters and iterations of matchups that I think you really need someone to invest time with you. 

Dynamically, this game feels too black and white for me. If you can predict your opponents move, then you can deal devastating damage, but sometimes you both just whiff.For me, the way Yomi manages a range of potential combat wins, akin to poker odds, rather than spatially, is a better representation of fighting or fighting games in game form. 

ID RATHER PLAY: YOMI.

RATING: 8
Amazingly simple, yet very fun game for 2 players. Tons of characters making the combinations to try out more than enough. And I have backed Devestation too so there will be plenty of match-ups available in the near future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I can't turn down more characters; I'm a sucker for unique playstyles in any game.

I would say the strongest pluses of War are the smaller size box and board (Devastation is an unwieldy beast), and the less complex characters. Don't get me wrong, War still has some very tough and interesting ones to play. But the concepts seem a little easier to grasp, and the basic characters of War are great for teaching purposes.

I've always liked fighting games, but lack the time and dedication to practice them enough to be competitive.
This is a fighting game, but without the reflex and muscle memory aspect.
I unfortunately don't play it much (girlfriend doesn't like the theme and not a lot of gaming evenings with friends anymore), but I push for 1-2 games each week during lunch time with coworkers.

Tenative rating at 7.  Like that there are so many characters and it is not a random game like Yomi. (perfect information in what the opponent can be play, but still balances the idea that you can have choice and bluffing).  The range is a much added features, and as other players/reviewers have noted, there is significantly more asymmetry in BattleCon than Yomi.

I'll rate all these BattleCON games the same, I'm sure.  Does a good job of capturing the feel of 2D fighting games, with many interesting fighters and environments, with lots of different moves in different combinations, to ensure games are always different.  I love how tactical it feels when I'm deep in the middle of a game.

STREET FIGHTER, THE CARD GAME!
I honestly love this game, but it's so incredibly hard to find people to play it. It really does have all the bluffing and technical depth of your arcade fighting games but in a turn based fashion. This game is actually what got me to be able to fully appreciate the technical skill of fighting game players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is the game that I have been looking for my whole life. This is as close to an arcade style fighting game as you can come in board game form. It's a tactical game where luck isn't a factor combined with a focus on positional control and asymmetric characters. I can feel myself getting better with every play which comes down to the wire. Both players have been in every match to the last strike. I haven't even touched the half of the great stuff in this box, and I can't wait to.

RATING: 6
After one play it's hard to me to judge it, certainly there is a big potential in here, but I feel like it requires a pretty big commitment to it in order to start enjoying it. Without the knowledge of yours and your's opponent cards it's almost like a game of War.

This game is fantastic! The characters all feel so different, but they are all very interesting. I love games where you have to outguess your opponent. I like that you have to take in things like spacing, priority, what cards are in the discard piles into consideration when figuring out what to play.
But the whole game plays really quickly, and the rules are not very complicated. Because everyone has the same base cards, it is easy to get going even if you're not that familiar with a certain character.

I consider this a big box expansion for Devastation (I know it is a stand alone). Not as big of a fan of this one as I don't like the smaller board. I will just be using the Devastation board. Our duel was very intense, with the Elemental Girl (forgot her name) just beating the Time Guy (forgot his name as well!) at the end of the 3rd and deciding match.

An okay 2p tug-of-war that reminds me of En Garde… but it has more bells and whistles in the form of interesting options compared to the simple/spartan En Garde game.  The "waiting" to re-use battle cards... TRANSMISSION LOST... (not sure what happened to the rest of my comment).

Just started with this, and I fully expect the rating to rise from this already lofty rating.

An excellent game, that emulates a fighting game and surpasses them in many ways. The characters are well designed, and each gives a rather unique spin on the game. I've been impressed every time I play a game.

Unfortunately, this is a dense game to teach. The mechanics are solid, and the rulebook is very well written, but every new match up presents new interactions to learn, so I can see this game coming with a very long learning curve.

This game combines a simple basic mechanic (play two cards, one each of two types), with a wide variety of modifying mechanics to distinguish each character. Feels like a "Street Fighter" video game, which isn't something I found very compelling in the arcade, but I think that might have been a lack of reflexes: this game is fun to mess around with.

I haven't tried the multiplayer or boss modes yet. I should at least figure out multiplayer so I can break this out at more game nights.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another 2-player game I purchased because a friend turned me on to it. This is a fun Street Fighter-esque type game where you're able to use semi-perfect information to outwit your opponent. There's a lot of depth here, but this is one of those games that rewards you for playing one character often to really learn the ins and outs. That's a great feature that allows you to really go deep with a character or two and eventually expand that out to other characters, but I could see some getting bored with it - either too wide too fast or too deep and too limiting. Overall though, I find it fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If I could give a game an 11, this whole series would be it. You'll never play every matchup available, storage is impossible without a custom setup, but man, it is SO worth it. If you have a passing interest in fighting games, you owe it to yourself to give it a go.

For all the world this is indistinguishable from an arcade Capcom fighting game, from the character designs to the lore to the finishers to the stages - except for the fact that it's slowed down to turn-based gameplay that allowed for actual strategy and intelligent decision-making instead of the twitch-reactions and flailing button mash of actually arcade offerings. The only thing I would have liked to see is a little more clarity in the rules, since I had to read through the books several times and play two matches before I felt like I had any handle on it at all even though it really isn't nearly as complex as it felt at the time.

Fighting game is one of my favorite video game genre. This game gives me similar feeling and it does really well. There is nothing what I can say against it. I will adjust the rating later between the other BattleCON boxes when I'll have them. Now it remains as 10.

Update:
It is clearly better than Devastation but otherwise Trials refined the rules much better.

I absolutely love this game. Similar to Yomi, which I also love, but the fact that all information is open to all players is the best bit. There's no being screwed by your hand in this one, and for me that removes the one issue in Yomi that I know a lot of people dislike (personally I find hand and card management in Yomi part of the strategic choice that is required in the game).

RATING: 9.5
The best 2P game that involves visceral movement and attacking on an one-dimensional battle field, which can lead to being blown over and mind-screwed by your opponent. I cannot get enough of this, and neither can anyone who I introduce it to. Doesn't get enough love from me simply due to the fact I play multiplayer games more often than 2P.

Haven't had the opportunity yet to mix characters from other boxes.

A great, no-luck two player duel game. The rules are extremely intuitive and there seems to be plenty of depth to be found. The huge amount of characters and options give this game loads and loads of replayability. A very pleasant surprise and definitely recommended!

RATING: 5
I can totally see why so many people love these games, because they introduce the awesome aspects of fighting games (such as "Every character is their own game!" or "The matches are so quick." or "The psychology between me and my opponent is deep!") and internal conflict that fighting games are structured around without the dexterity or hardware required. 

However, as a fighting game fan, I feel like this is only half of what makes a fighting game great. Not having "execution" (inputs)tied to the game only makes me feel like I'm playing exclusively a double bluff game, not a game where I can control all aspects of the fight. I don't feel like it's as common to do things like bait out attacks, lock down a character, or create okizeme in BattleCON as it is in a fighting game. 

So regardless of that, BattleCON does a fantastic job showing what makes fighting games compelling. I feel like one could get an even deeper experience out of what this game is based on.

See Devastation of Indines.

Think of this as the starter set. Simpler characters / less quantity in the box.

Kickstarter War Remastered edition.

Pros: BattleCON system. nice components. Beautiful game. Characters aren't as complex as other Indines games but still deep and satisfying. Very approachable and not overwhelming with content, yet lots of game in the box. I think this is the best intro game to BattleCON.

Cons: No beat counter. Missing plastic stand up pieces. Dislike the compact board, which is fine for Fate but seems like they just did it to cut costs in War. Imo, some of the art isn't as good as Fate or Devastation. For the price point, this doesn't offer quite the value for your money as Devastation (Devastation is an incredible value when it comes to content for the price point). NOTE: Level 99 customer service is excellent and they quickly replaced the missing pieces.

Giving this a 9 due to the lack of beat counter and smaller board that requires discards to be half off it. Come on, Level 99, this was just a bad decision. I understand for a more compact game like Fate, but War should be full size.

Alongside Yomi, this is the best 1v1 fighting game available.  It has so much content and replayability, you'll never run out of game.  Extremely impressive roster and enough uniqueness between the characters to truly make them feel different and require different strategies to play with and against.  

However, the game having so much content and no acceptable way to store all the components means it doesn't hit the table very often, which is an incredible shame.

Fantastic head-to-head card combat game. Much like the 2-D fighter genre that it emulates, the game gets better as you learn how to play specific fighters to their fullest potential.  Love the concept of combining two card sets to form your moves and the role of range and spatial positioning. I can't believe so many 2-d fighter concepts are captured here in such a small, accessible, rule set.  Amazing, and lots of fun.  Can't wait for the sequel in July.

The basics are simple and yet even very straightforward rules of thumb that you learn from playing one character may turn out to be totally irrelevant for another. Excellent mechanics. Excellent theme integration. Wish I got to play it more. I also wish the publisher weren't so committed to calling all players "he".

This game is good. Really good. It feels like a near perfect implementation of fighting games into a turn-based system. The game is super tight, it's got the mindgames/reads and the slight long-term strategy. It's got basically infinite characters and tons of replayability while rewarding familiarity very strongly. The game system is overall intuitive and easy to learn. 

That being said the production of this game is garbage. Straight up. The box was caved in because the insert didn't fit, the insert didn't have enough room for the character kits and the kits themselves were flimsy and came creased. The dials and some tokens are printed misaligned, and the dials don't fit together well. The cards have that shitty oily feel and came scuffed or with residue on them, some reference cards were miss-sized. However, the board was done well-enough and the standees were good. I'm kinda annoyed by terminology (Beats and Soak vs Rounds and Block) but nothing terrible. Some wordings are overly long or un-intuitive. Board for Fate of Indines came super warped.

I'm going to start this badboy off with an 8, and we'll see how the rating changes with more plays.  Conceptually, I think this game is amazing and blows Yomi out of the water as far as strategy goes since the different types of attacks are more varied.  And with all the character specific mods, players have to choose carefully, and really think about their opponent's action as much as their own.  Didn't kickstart it though because i'd have to pay the stupid shipping.

Doublethink with enough structure to feel non-random. I approve. This game also manages to capture a decent amount of the feel of 2D fighters, which is awfully impressive.
[EDIT] After a few more plays I definitely prefer this to Yomi. This is less about literal RPS and more about tactical positioning--positioning both in literal terms and in terms of managing your available attacks.

RATING: 6
I Kickstarted this game, based on the PnP materials, designer diary posted on BGG, and the video.  

I've played Flash Duel, Puzzle Strike, Strange Synergy, and BRAWL card game from Cheapass, and BattleCON looks similar- while at the same time seeming to improve on these games in many ways.  

A light-tactics fighting game with cards should move just as quick as such a fight would take- especially one that pays homage to 2D console fighter games like Street Fighter.  I'm excited for this.  

I love the mechanics and the elegant card design, and how this game allows for "personality" between the different combatants/styles, complexity, strategy, & variety from game-to-game.  

While not a CCG per se (another plus), it does allow for affordable expansions introducing new characters in the future, and even encourages "homebrew" hacks.  

I hope that this game really takes off.

RATING: 9
Really smart and fun game that captures a lot of the fun of fighting games. It doesn't really have any combo-like setup but it does have fun characters and move mixes.

I would liken Yomi to Street Fighter and BattleCON to SNK games. BattleCON has fun and wacky characters with a lot of variety but Yomi is a bit more balanced on the whole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The original BattleCON, now remastered, means that all the archetypal characters are now re-balanced, re-arted, and re-packaged. Because they are fighting game archetypes, they may not provide the healthy flexibility of Devastation, but certainly provide a cleaner narrative of what each and every character [i]should[/i] do: "oh you've got the gunner? You're probably going to turtle at long range (until you have to reload)."" Oh, you've got a high-powered goliath of a robot? I should probably keep my distance and poke as safely as I can!"

This whole family of games provides great tactical choices which are highly based upon reading: the board, the cards that are left, but most importantly, your opponent. I love when bluffing games give me a whole spectrum of valuations to work with when doing the guess work! This game provides that uneven valuation in spades. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Flawless translation of a 2D fighting game into board game form! This game allows for a lot of bluffing, mind games, and general outplaying, which is exactly what you need to make a game like this work! It's crazy how there are so many characters, yet make each one feel very unique. Every game is quick and feels very different from the last. Battlecon: War of Indines is a gem.

My favourite "simultaneous selection" game. 

Some people say that BattleCON is not as well balanced as YOMI, but I prefer it to YOMI because it feels much more thematic due of its spatial element. In BattleCON, your fighters can move towards or away, and launch attacks that only hit enemies far away or enemies close to them, so it's easy to imagine the videogame fight it is evoking.

Also, I love the design philosophy of Level99games of never leaving behind already published material. Many new fighters and expansions of BattleCON have been published, but none of the already existing material has ever become obsolete.

A remarkable fighting game. Every character is totally different from all other fighters. Quality cards, nice artwork, innovative ideas. Easy set up, and take down.

Its a rock-paper-scissors game with a beat 'em up theme attached. I would agree that its probably one of the better implementations I've seen (compared with say Yomi or UFS), but its not perfect.

The game is simple enough to learn, and yes, the fighters are varied in their abilities (which leads to a bit of downtime while learning the different "rules" of each character). But I think what is lacking is simply pace. Choosing and resolving punches and jabs and kicks is not fast, and not very satisfying. Players are basically spending a minute or so running through 1 beat (i.e. one attack).

*****************************************
OK.  This won.  Yomi is good...this is GREAT.

In fact, my only minor complaint with this GEM thus far is how seemingly (to me) important Priority is.  Or...how unimportant it is.  It seems to have huge swings from game to game, where it means everything...or nothing.

Other than that, this is BRILLIANT!!!!!
Incredible variety in character archetypes.  Fast, mostly smooth gameplay.  No luck!  Close, balanced battles.  Expandable...not only future, but with what's in the box!  Arenas, tag teams, multi-player, 2 or 3 vs. 1s.  So many things to play through here!!!

I can't say enough about this game.  Incredible job from a small publisher and new designer.  

I am in for the LONG HAUL with this game!!!!!

This game has been a really fantastic experience. Some duels have been frustrating, some have been great. As you learn the characters and cards more, everything starts to click. You start to get a feel of what combos will be effective and what your opponent might do. When first learning, it can all feel random but strategies emerge with more plays. When you lose, you know it wasn't because of something out of your control. Having perfect information is a really interesting mechanic for the game that only adds to the strategy. Excellent game that will take me ages to fully explore. Will definitely pick up Devastation of Indines in the future to compliment this.

Expansion

BattleCON: War of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head play. Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of 18 different characters, from a fire elemental, an ocean guardian and her panda familiar, a space-bending trapper, a shadowy assassin, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.

RATING: 6
All the fighting game concepts seems to be there and there is a large variety of characters. Players could probably design various kind of matches or even make tournaments without any problems. But I don't like the game enough to buy it.

First, I played with apparently the worst character in the game, so that does not help much to appreciate the game.

Second, it's a game about mind games, and I don't really like that sort of games.

Else, the combination of 2 cards is an interesting mechanic not found anywhere else.

The central board is just too small. I would have made a foldable board with space to place the health token.

RATING: 8
Dang! If you've ever wanted to play a board game that felt like a fighting game, this is the game for you. I swear playing this game took me back to my childhood playing mortal combat and street fighter II. The mechanics are simple and quick to grasp, I don't know how well balanced the characters are against one another yet but so far what I've seen is a good balance. But this game comes with 18 characters, which is amazing value for your purchase price. Looking forward to playing this one a lot more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I appreciated the fast pace.

Not many rules questions on the first play. This is fortunate, because the rulebook is hard to use as a reference [the index is very partial, and I did not find any of the three terms I was looking for: Basic Characters, On Hit [?],…]).

I like the fact that the choices are not overwhelming (only 3 styles at a given time). It was not too hard to get a simple feel for the cards of my opponent (Magdelina: slow, but can level up).

I like the difference of feel between characters (Magdelina levels up, Hikaru [Hiraku?] doesn't…).

This is a lighter game, though, less tense than BattleLine, less varied than Magic, but also more varied than BattleLine and shorter than Magic.

Components. The card quality is not so high, but not bad either: cards are a little thin but serviceable, the printing is not perfect (some black or white splashes), one card had a piece of hard material stuck on it,… However, the tokens are of a decent thickness and are not too hard to punch out.

The art is fine, even though I am not a fan of all the styles (one character is too rigid…). Too bad the bases have such a simple drawing on them, though: a more evocative and detailed drawing would have been nice.

After a single play, this leaves me with the feeling that the game is a little to simple, not deep enough to provide as great an experience as other short games (some short ones: Hive; some slightly longer ones: Race for the Galaxy, Dominion, or Puzzle Strike). Maybe a little like Battle For Hill 218: nice, but "small".

2nd game: In a way, I am less in control than in my first games of Race (this is not a quality of BattleCon): I do not have a clear picture of my opponent's possible moves (even with the Bases we share: I don't picture their differences so well, as they vary mostly in numbers, with effects that are somewhat unrelated to the numbers). So, ironically, an essentially simpler game is less "legible" for me; this is not a good point. But the fact that it is not too easy makes me want to try characters again, so understand them better, to start knowing my opponent. It feels almost like a videogame, but this is not so good, as playing a game of BattleCon takes more time than playing a match of a fighting game (35 minutes, here, for us, setup and tear up included). I still have hope that this is a game that I can appreciate, that I can grasp better.

Still an interesting game, in the category of 15' 2-player game. But it requires a higher upfront investment than other games in this category, say, Battle Line, Hive, Army Ants, Blokus,… I am still hoping that the game can provide a "smooth" experience where I can feel in control, where I can both expand my strategy beyond something very basic ("Cadenza must remain in melee") and learn to implement it efficiently (I do not have a clear, simple mental picture of the set of cards).

A fantastic card-fighting game. Tense, multiple plays over an hour, and always meta (which I LOVE) makes this such a good starter to an evening.

This is probably one of the coolest games out right now. It's a deep dueling card game similar to a 2d fighting video game. 
18 characters in the box, 4 promo characters, so far, can play 1v1,2v1,3v1,2v2, and a few other variantions present in the box. There is a lot here to like.

An added bonus is all the cards are dry erase markable, and come with a blank set of cards to possibily create your own characters.

What could lower this score:
- if the guessing mechanic gets frustrating.
- if there feels to be not enough choices in card to play (it did on one game, but too soon to tell about this).

Wow ! blown away by the depth of this beauty. For me a truly great game needs to give you the player a way to deal with whatever is thrown at you and this intricate, intense behemoth of a battler does just that. I love fighting games. In fact I own every fighting game (computer) that's worth having and this card game not only captures the feel of the best of these it completely understands the genre. The variety of characters is downright amazing. Now I'm not talking just the designs, although they rock, I'm referring  to the fighting styles. Each character is vastly different to use which makes it so exciting and it will take kill bill style dedication to become a master with each. Even the best computer fighting game could learn a lot from this. Love it.

Plus dozens and dozens of games on the ipad.  I love how differently every character plays.  Its the meta game that really makes this one work.  Reading not only your opposing character, but your opponents behaviors as well really makes for an engaging experience.  This is probably my favorite game ever.

An interesting fighting game simulation, even if matches sometimes go on a little too long for what they need to be. For me, the game is fine. I like it a hell of a lot more than Yomi, which is essentially glorified Rock, Paper, Scissors. This game at least has a little strategy, though I'm not a big fan of the choose a move and reveal simultaneously mechanism. I think fans of fighting games will like this game, but for me it's not something I felt like I wanted to play over a video game.

Would rather play Puzzle Strike.

Both players know the capabilities of their opponent. Really wish there were other players in my area! Hoping to get others in my group interested in this.

This is one of the games that I wish a local community existed for in my area. BattleCon, Epic, Codex, and Mage Wars all have a place in my heart as games that deserve communities the size of MTG and Yugioh.

RATING: 6.5
A fighting game that tries to recreate the feel of a video game. The mechanics are not too complex and the game is fun to play, but it becomes a rock, paper, scissor type guess, since you cannot really predict what your opponent will do, so you just try and guess or aim for a strong hit. Still the characters are very nice and the game is fun.

I consider this the "base" BattleCON game, and really the starting point of the whole series and where new players should begin.

We've literally turned this game, as a community, into a competitive sport, and we show no signs of ceasing, even if the whole series becomes discontinued and Brad Talton becomes a hermit.

As a whole, this series is my #2 board game of all time.  As a standalone game, War is by far the best, offering many unique characters and playstyles while remaining relatively balanced (we'll pretend fan "favorites" like Hepzibah and Demitras don't exist for this argument.)

RATING: 10
The best fighting game simulation on the board game market today.

It blows Yomi out of the water by a big margin. The main difference in Battlecon is that the spacing, postionning and the movement matters in this game unlike in Yomi, which are the main aspects (known as Footsies) in a 2D fighter.

Every characters are so unique, the artwork is amazing. The contents are overwhelming in a good way with all the different extras and many game options. There's Zero randomness, as it's all about knowing the match-ups, spacing (footsies) and predicting your opponents moves.

If you like fighting games in general, then Battlecon is a no brainer for sure. Even for people not familiar with fighting games, they will have a blast. Go grab a copy quick !!

A good two player fighting game. The basic rules are pretty simple, but to really play well you need to be familiar with both characters in play and what all their moves do. This feels like it would be a great game for people who get really into it, but not necessarily great for casual pick-up-and-play gamers.

My rating reflects how much I like it as a casual pick-up-and-play game. If I had a dedicated opponent that wanted to get deep into the game and learn it, I would likely rate it higher.

The game is simple to teach, but anyone unaccustomed to fighting games in any medium will clutch their player aid to keep track of which phase they're in. Me and the wife found it enjoyable to just pick random pairs for our first match to understand the flow of the game. Definitely needs a regular opponent to get everything out of.

BattleCON is a 2 player dueling game with no randomness, though it feels slower paced than I would really prefer for this type of game. The other main issues are that it's not particularly casual friendly and the balance between characters isn't as tight as I would like. There is a lot of strategy and a huge number of matchups, but without a regular opponent it's hard to get into the game. The card system where you combine a style and a base to form a move and then it takes 2 turns for them to cycle back into your hand is brilliant, but, at the same time, makes it very difficult to quickly analyze both players' options. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I thought the way the cards go together is neat.  I found the spacial aspect kind of annoying though.  This game is not bad, but in the end I much prefer the way Yomi implements the same theme.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fighting game with a slight spatial component (like Flash Duel), where you outguess each other (Yomi) with 2-card combinations. Perfect information (unique) but with high nuance in perception of the game state.

On the plus side, there is infinite replayability with each character being a lesson in completely new ideas, mechanisms and strategy. The action cycling is used well here to make 'current' and 'future' states important and lend depth to the information state. Character asymmetry is more 'dense' in this game because every single move is half-completed by a unique character trait, as opposed to, say, Sirlin games, which feel like variations upon a core in comparison (poker deck, or a special character move only comes in after X # of 'base' turns). The fact that 5 character styles and 7 bases, 12 cards for each player, causes so much AP (and in an interesting manner because of the action cycling), is remarkable.

But also because of this, I wish the game were more 'playable'. Right now, it takes a long time to figure out the perfect move and what the stakes are, and there's a pressure to just 'get on with it' when part of my head wants to take forever and figure out everything. Suspect that among inexperienced players, you win by surprising your opponent with a combo (which he can figure out if he subjects you to a ton of AP), whereas if you're experienced, you might as well play a game that boils down the payoffs of the rock-paper-scissors more simply. 

I'm just concerned with the long-term trajectory, since neither 'surprise your opponent because otherwise it'll take too long' nor 'I played paper because my internal calculator gives 83.353% chance of you casting rock, and you... just stuck 2 fingers out randomly' appeals greatly to me. Until then, I'm still interested in exploring this game, and maybe it'll be some sweet spot in between.

4+3

[i]Wholly Ambitious Asymmetric Design! Enough Characters to Keep You Playing as Long as You Want To! Very bloated, though, and that inaccessibility keeps it from true greatness[/i]

This game is really amazing in that it has such a truly diverse cast. I don't know of any other game where the characters are as differentiated, and with expansions there are over 60 of them.

However, both the overall system and even the gameplay within one match is super bloated. This game is pretty unapproachable for all but the most dedicated, if you want to learn to play it well.

On the first time in a matchup and on some critical or tricky turns, you could easily stare at your cards for 20 minutes per turn, working out different options for you and your opponent.

However, if you don't hate yourself, you'll realize that this game is best played loosely while learning. This is a case where it is much more fun to learn the matchups through overall experience, playing a dozen games in a few hours, rather than trying to analyze your first couple plays and only get two games in in the same time.

Still, while the ambitious design is admirable in a sense, with all the expansions for this game now the character roster is simply ridiculous. It would take lifetimes to get enough experience against every character to play this game as smoothly as it deserves to be.

So the bloated design that makes it impossible to master is actually at odds with how this game is best played: by two experts. Those first plays with a character where you're trying to figure out which styles and bases even make sense together, can be tedious and bogged down.

However, this is still such an impressive game, and I enjoy playing it so much (even if much of the enjoyment is yet-to-come -- only potential and theoretical) that it is highly rated by me regardless.

For the fighting gamers: This is basically a MUGEN board game.

This game is a sort of Rock, Paper, Scissors style battle game where each player plays a unique character that combines a set of their own unique cards to a set of common cards both players have to create an attack with different power, speed, and range values as well as special effects.  The goal is to get your opponent down to zero life before they get you.

I'm not a big fan of outguessing games so the Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanics that underlie this whole game kind of put me off.  I do like games with a lot of content and variable player powers though so that sort of elevates it a little but this isn't something I would seek out to play that often.

Rating is based on my (mild) disappointment with the first play. How many potential steps for each "beat"? Let's see...

1. Choose your two cards
2. Ante tokens if possible
3. Reveal cards
4. Perform any reveal effects
5. Check priority and resolve any clashes
6. Perform any start of beat effects
7. Active player performs Before Activating effects
8. Active player Checks Range
9. If in range, active player does damage and performs ON HIT effects.
10. If active player hits, consider STUN damage
11. If active player hits, consider SOAK reductions
12. If active player hits, perform ON DAMAGE effects
13. Active player performs After Activating effects
14. If Reactive player is not stunned, he considers steps 7-9, 11-13 (he cannot stun)
15. Both players perform any End of Beat effects.
16. Both players recycle their cards

Whew! In all fairness, you won't have to follow each step each time. And I will grant that the number of steps isn't inherently directly proportional to fun factor. Still, checking for each step and making sure you follow them in the correct order is monstrously tedious for your first few games. It's also somewhat anti-thematic in that a fighting game should move more quickly. I guess it gets better the more you play as there as many high ratings for this game. Maybe you get to a point where both players reveal their cards and there's an immediate reaction in which BOTH players know what just happened without having to flowchart it out. Depth? Yes. But at a substantial fun cost.

Rating could go up. I hope it does.

The better videogame inspired card-based fighting game. While the central mechanic is about outguessing your opponent, there's a lot of meat in learning all the possible combinations of attacks. Each character does fairly unique things, and is empathically NOT "oh this one has 10% more throws". Downside to all that meat is, this relatively simple game has quite a high learning curve. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game does a fantastic job of simulating an old-school fighting game.  I really like that this game takes range into effect and allows you to play a positional game.  That's a really great touch that gives this one character.

Speaking of characters, this game has a LOT of them!  You've got a bevy of player choices and each of them is very unique.  They've all got their own play styles and some great tricks that make them all feel unique.  It's a real treat to have so many choices.

I'm only a few plays in, but I really like this one.  I'm really looking forward to more opportunities to play this one.

If you enjoy playing arcade or console fighting games (or have fond memories of such), you simply need to get your hands on a copy of BattleCON. Just like any fighter worth its weight, the system here rewards practice and mastery with the characters. This is the type of game that opens up the more you play it, and the wide cast of characters all bring something interesting to the table -- both mechanically and thematically. While a quick glance might suggest this game is of the Ameritrash variety, it certainly has the bite of a solid Euro in terms of play optimization. If there is one downside to this game, it would be that it is the bane of AP-prone players, especially when learning a new character. Regardless, this may be the pinnacle of fighting games and is a must if you're in the market for one. 

As a side note, I should quickly touch on Yomi, as the two often get compared because of their similar theme. Stated simply, these games play vveerryy differently. Yomi is a fine game in its own right and I still happily play it. It's also the easier game to get into it if you're looking for a nice entry point.

Fast and focused fighting game simulator. Each of dozens of characters is made up of a handful of cards that are combined to create a unique move set, establishing initiative, damage, defense, movement, range, and a variety of special effects.

The amount of variety in the different characters is huge. The production is also excellent. Thick cardboard standees, life-counter dials, card holders to keep things separated, a nice glossy board, tons of tokens for the different characters.

Then there's the gameplay. The first problem is the lack of any randomness. This means that every turn you have to go through all of the options of what your opponent could possibly play before choosing your own cards. This can take several minutes and really slows down the game.

I actually like looking at my hand of cards and trying to make my best possible move. That part is quick and fun. But if you don't take the time to analyze your opponent's options then they can usually just cancel out your best move in some way.

It also seems like there can be some one-sided matchups. This, along with a number of fighters that have been updated for balance and possibly banned, makes it seem like not enough development has taken place.

I wanted to like it, but I just can't get into a game that is this slow and AP-prone.

Update: This company has now made a far better game called Exceed, which is based on Battlecon. It actually addresses most of the problems I pointed out here: there is now a good amount of randomness, AP is no longer as much of an issue (mainly because of the randomness), and the turns have been greatly streamlined. The cardplay has actually been improved over Battlecon because you now have an element of managing your cards as they have multiple uses in Exceed. Exceed really feels like the game they originally wanted to make, but they didn't quite know how to do it back then so it just needed a few years of refinement.

The closest a boardgame could get to playing a 2D fighter like Streetfighter. And it's rockin' fun.

It has an approachable but inherently interesting and dramatic battle system, a system that only gets more and more exciting as you progress and unlock characters. Also unlocking characters is rad, more games should do this. 

Oh and the art is stellar.

Remastered Kickstarted 2014-06

This was the first game I Kickstarted. It was quite the game. I heard about it after getting into Yomi, and I was not disappointed with the product. It better captures the feel of a 2D fighter than Yomi (but Yomi is a better "reading" / "prediction" game). The characters are diverse and interesting.

I am a bit sad that the ideal set up for War Remastered is rebuying the entire game, especially after I kickstarted many Level 99 games and have two copies of the original release. I didn't end up springing for an entire new box - I got enough play out of my War box, and I need to play more Devastation!

I think the board was the only thing seriously hampering this game. The supposed Second Edition should fix most of what's wrong with this.

Not the biggest fan of the genre.  This one was enjoyable enough but didn't especially grab me; I could easily see this rating dropping a little bit or raising a lot with more plays.

The original game in the BattleCON series, this one recently got a facelift to bring it up to snuff with the system's current design aesthetic. There are some minor adjustments to game play, such as a new starting position for the fighters, but otherwise it's the same game early adopters of the system know and love. There are a ton of fighters, all of which are completely unique in both strategy and fight mechanics.

This requires quite a bit of investment to learn the fighters, but if you and a friend take the time to do so, it becomes an almost endlessly entertaining battle of wills.

First, the revised P&P is an 8 or 9 for me, so I'd highly encourage people to check that out.

I wish I could rate this higher, because the system is very fun, but rules inconsistencies and especially balance problems mean I can't really do so. Luc vs. Vanaah, for instance, seems to be virtually unwinnable for Vanaah as printed, and both of those are recommended beginner players (that particular match caused several friends at the next table to decide never to play again, unfortunately). This seems to be all fixed in the revised edition, so I hope that sees a full release someday.

I'm also surprised I'm the only one as of this writing not recommending this with 4. It feels like an underdeveloped variant; in my one game of it, we had usability issues with the life track (ended up abandoning it for a piece of paper) and about every other beat we had a funky rules interaction related to having multiple lanes and/or opponents. I'm hoping the revised edition clears this up as well, though I haven't tried it yet.

One of my absolute favorite games.  Perfect knowledge and positioning make this game the only simultaneous reveal I know of that isn't RPS.  Characters play differently and a sacrifice this turn can lead to victory next turn(or 3 turns down the line)

The first and still the best of the BattleCON series of games. While I enjoy them all, and certain characters from other sets are among my favorites, as a complete list of characters and how they interact with each other, War Remastered just sits the best for me.

The first play didn't impress me as much as I had hoped, but I think I picked a character that wasn't very beginner-friendly. I like the system of combining character-specific modifiers with base attacks, even though it didn't work in my favor. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, assume I might have a chance with another character, and play a few more times.

The production of the game does leave a little to be desired, though. The ridiculous number of token types and tiny board with multiple trackers crammed onto it are just not good ideas. If the game were more manageable, I could be a huge fan of it.

RATING: 7.8
Solid non-CCG fighting card game akin to YOMI.  Simple rules but lots of choice decisions to make.  Eighteen characters out of the box give the game good variety for a long time.  Nice touch that the characters are rated as basic, moderate, and advanced levels for play.

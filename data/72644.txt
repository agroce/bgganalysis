I'm not sure if this is a boardgame... 

Nice one to play every once in a while; you play it several dozen times and once you've made it to the end, the game will sit on a shelf for a few years.

Perplexus clone, from The Sharper Image.  More difficult  than Perplexus original, because the track siderails aren't as tall.

I've seen this puzzle on the shelf of the local toy store for months thinking "meh" -- now that we have one, though, we're ADDICTED.  Not sure how long that will last, but at this point, my kids and I fight over who gets to be the next to play.  My 7 y.o. daughter in particular loves this solo puzzle.  Great fun to have on hand when you have a few minutes to fill.

Not sure why this has a separate entry as it's more a solo puzzle than a game.  Should fit under the "Outside the scope of BGG" umbrella.

Mine sits, in its stand, on a console table in the Living Room. Anyone who comes to the house picks it up and gives it a go. I play with it almost daily! Great Silly Fun!

More of a toy than a game, but it has a BGG entry. It's actually oddly addicting. My daughter got it for Christmas, and we've all spent a ridiculous amount of time playing with it.

Great toy; the fact that it's exactly the same every time makes it hard to rate as a 'game'.

Previously owned means something different for me. These are games I most likely got before I got into gaming. Either they were bought for me or my family or I bought them for my wife or son. Either way this is just a placeholder as I'm not going to record plays for these games.

I usually hates this kind of game, where you have to be super patient to make any progress. I tend to rage quit quite fast.

But Perplexus...I don't know, it's magic. The thing is so much fun you want to keep playing even though you keep failing on the same difficult. The fact that you have checkpoints is also a big plus to avoid frustration.

I bought it and doesn't regret it. I'm giving it a 8 because once you finish it, replay value is limited.

[gameid=6546] with another axis. The design is compelling (and they *flew* off the shelves), but the novelty faded fast. I guess solo dexterity mazes just aren't my thing.

If you like mazes, you might check into Robert Abbott's rule-based mazes (e.g., in one you're allowed only to make left turns).

This is a nice little coffee table distraction. Some tricky moves but nothing too hard to complete. My biggest complaint would be that some of the paths are a little tricky to find due to the tiny numbers but for the most part it is pretty clear. 

I appreciate the checkpoints but find it more satisfying to complete it in one sitting.

Like the video game 'Dark Souls' in a toy. That is, in terms of trying the same thing over and over again until you finally get it right (sometimes by luck). Abandon your frustration, summon your patience, and victory will be sweet.

 Bonus health benefit: it seems to lower my blood pressure and heartbeat, and steady my breathing. Oddly, I can see it having the exact opposite effect on many people.

For a solitaire puzzle game, this is fantastic. I still haven't completed it yet but it's not for lack of trying. It sits next to my PC so whenever my video games are loading, I'll pick it up and have another go. No other puzzle game has ever made me pick it up as much as this one.

My dad used to reset the score because the best score was not his. My daughter, 8, has been playing for a few years now, but we don't turn it on yet for her to score her runs. She isn't allowed to beat me yet.

I do own this, but I don't think of this as a "game" for collection stat purposes and would rather not have it show up in my current collection.

Perplexus is awesome, and I recommend each of them!

Fell in love when we gave this to our neices and nephews, excited to play some more after christmas! Great game for people with young an older children because you cannot lose the parts, self contained ball!

Breaks faily easily, as I found out recently when one boy threw it at the floor.

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] Une excellente façon de faire passer quelques minutes lorsqu'on attend entre 2 jeux, ou encore pendant que sa conjointe se prépare ou encore... Bon, enfin, vous avez compris le concept. Plusieurs difficultés apportent à ce labyrinthe une bonne re-jouabilité, mais attention, il est facile d'accrocher tant qu'on a pas réussi!

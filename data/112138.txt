Simple and enjoyable miniature battle game.  The figures are cute, to say the least, but are good quality and very nice sculpts.  Rules have very little complexity but cover enough to make the game tactical and interesting.

Muy monas las figuritas, pero no deja de ser un mini-dungeon crawler en 1vs1 excesivamente sencillo y con muy poca chicha para mi gusto. Es un ejemplo del figurismo y márqueting en los juegos a donde puede llegar.

Disappointing.  I really wanted to like this.  The board looks like a lot of fun, the cool mini's, the fact that it was already printed in Japan and must have done well enough to warrant a reprint in english.

Unfortunately the game is just very blah.  The characters aren't very interesting, the gameplay doesn't have much depth.  Very sad.

I'm told it would be better with 2, but I've got plenty of amazing 2p games I'd rather play.

KS campaign sucked. Lack of communications and delays.
The product is amazing.
Cute/great miniatures, love the simple battling style, art = superb, and the visual effect in general is mind-bblowing good. It was like when I first saw Heroscape.

Thus, I will probably back future KS for Krosmaster for promos. Now that Erica is there for communication, I don't see any problem.

A tactical miniatures game for 2 players. The game looks awesome with all the huge miniatures and the 3D objects on the board. Rules seem simple enough and there is of course some luck involved in the dice rolling.
This game looks promising but as always you need a dedicated partner.

Played just the base game. I thought the rulebook and how it introduces the rules was a great idea, but as we were learning it quickly at a convention it made it kinda tough to find where the rules for different things were. The character powers and how they interact with each other are interesting. Its a great implementation of a simple table-top war game. My only problem with it, and the thing that would forbid me from buying it, is the cheeba anime theme. If I had kids the right age I would definitely play this with them, but its just too much for me personally. Still a fun game mechanically, if you like the theme then you should jump on it.

I'm not sure what it is about this game, but it absolutely rubs me the wrong way.  I really liked the miniatures, and the rules seemed simple and fitting enough, but after one time playing it, I felt bored, annoyed, and really don't know what it is about it.  I'd certainly give it another go, but expect I would feel the same again :-\.

RATING: 9
We love the look and feel of this game. The miniatures are goofy, colorful, and well rendered. The capabilities of the various characters can be a bit unbalanced. Some characters are much more effective than others for the same cost. Nevertheless, super fun to play pitting different kinds of attacks and abilities against each other.

This game has gorgeous figures, and I bet 90% of owners bought it for this reason. I am among that 90%.

Beyond the awesome components, anyway, seems there is a nice little game of miniature fighting, with some interesting band-building aspect and engaging tactical-level decision making.

Each player builds a band worth 12GG (usually 3-4 figures), and battles the opponent on a square-grid map.
Turns are fast, engaging and straightforward, but some thinking is required to pull out the best from each situation.

I bought this not expecting much, and now I'd like to aim towards a complete collection... Too bad in Italy the open 4-figures booster packs won't be available, instead we have to buy single-miniatures blind boxes...

Initial Impression: This is one cute game! The component quality is top-notch and the game feels very thematic, especially when using the optional rules of breaking terrain to gain coins. I suspect that underneath all the cuteness lies a fairly tactical minis game, although I need to play a few more matches to see if that's true. This game is easy to learn/teach and plays quickly, with almost no downtime. Every action requires a dice roll, which somewhat helps to level the playing field between beginners and experienced players. Part of the fun of the game is to mix and match characters so I suspect that I will be buying expansions at some point fairly soon.

3/11/2014: This needs another update.  I missed a very important component while drafting characters on my last play of this.  I completely ignored the level so my friend technically did have a far more powerful team than I did.  This doesn't lower my score as I love all things about this game.  I love the gameplay and all the unique characters. The pieces are amazing and all minis are pre-painted and look awesome.  And after watching most of the first season of the Wakfu animated series, I am even more invested in the lore of this game.

2/17/2014: Upping my score to a 9 based on my latest play. A friend of mine and I did a blind draw for our characters. It was a rough game. I felt from the beginning that I got a raw deal from that blind draw, but after the game was over, I started thinking about how I could have done things differently and I kinda changed my mind on that. I think I had a chance. I just didn't use my team as well as my friend. His skills were more obvious, I suppose. If I had played a better strategy, it might have been a closer match. Even though I lost, I still very much enjoyed the battle and I felt like it was a clean victory for my friend. Also, I have the uncontrollable urge to buy all expansion pieces to this game. All of the components are such high quality.

Played my first game.  I'm going to start my score at a solid 8.  I have had more fun playing Zombicide, but that is due to the fact that I REALLY enjoy co-op games.  The components are awesome.  I didn't spend the extra money on the resin terrain or tokens or the metal coins.  I feel that the base game components are perfectly sufficient.  Not to mention that they could essentially be replaced with anything for any theme.  The kama coins could be replaced with small jewels or jelly beans.  The gallons of glory could be replaced with cookies.  The Krosmaster minis are amazing.  They are well detailed, fun to look at, and pre-painted.  I absolutely love the fact that they are pre-painted.  The rules do an excellent job of keeping the game moving a long.  The roll for tension has the potential to really shorten the game and force some quick and daring decisions.  Like most games where dice are heavily involved, there is a lot of chance, but I feel that the depth of combat leaves plenty of room to feel like your defeat is your own fault.

I played a two player game where each of us had two Krosmasters.  My friend took the fire knight and the water knight.  I took the Queen of the Tofus and the King of the Gobbals.  The game lasted for about two hours which is twice the suggested game time, but a lot of that time was spent reading and referencing the rules.  A battle with players who have played the game a few times should only take about 45 minutes to an hour.  Just drafting my team was very time consuming with 26 Krosmasters to choose from.  I backed the game on Kickstarter.  My pledge included 6 different promo characters and the first three expansions with 4 characters each.  And the base game comes with 8.  Once we got moving, the combat became a lot more fluid.  The Tofus and the Gobbal were very devastating when surrounding an enemy.  In the end it was an extremely close game.  My friend purchased two HP upgrades on the water knight who has a heal spell.  So, he had 21 total HP and added the Healer power which actually let him heal 3 HP per use.  It took everything I had to finally take him down (some lucky criticals also helped).  While I hacked at his water knight, he stood his fire knight on crate and dropped area effect fire bombs on me.  This often took out my Tofus and eventually killed the Queen.  I won with only 2HP left on the King of the Gobbals.  One lucky crit and I would have died for sure.  I think having the Armor power was really what saved me overall.  It makes a difference to be able to roll the extra dice on defense.

Overall an excellent experience.  This game will be a huge hit with my gaming group and I think with a few small alterations and maybe a handicap, it could also be fun for my kids.  I do not regret the money I spent backing this game.  I also plan to collect any other expansions and promos I can get as they are released.  I wouldn't spend a dime on eBay for overpriced promos, but if I were to be in the right place at the right time, I wouldn't pass up the opportunity to get more of them under safe and fair circumstances.

Gameplay wise, this is a short skirmish game, much like Final Fantasy Tactics. The rules are very simple, but the variety on figures and powers make this an extremely fun and replayable game. The bad part? This game is collectible, and in Spain new characters come in blind buy boxes.

Components-wise, this is an extremely beautiful game. The scenery is awesome, and the minis themselves are incredibly cool. I wish I had the 3D bombs, dolls and tofus sculpts (the punch-outs are OK, but next to the rest of the game they pale a little). Cardboard trees are actually OK, though I'd obviously like the 3D ones, too :P

Very solid game; basically a board game version of turn-based tactical RPGs of olden days.

Fun, but can become a little stale over time.

One thing to bear in mind; the miniatures, although very pretty, are a bit overpriced and tend to break easily. Try to take extra caution with them and keep them away from any kind of heat source.

If no one buy this, then I'll build some 'squad', print it out on a card so players can randomly pick the composition of characters they will play and take their respective figures.  Have to look at the build available online.

I don't like the initiative rules that come with the original rule set.  Probably will hack the game and use our 'in-house' initiative rule following the vein of Neuroshima Shima Hex and X-Wings where instead of having the player with the highest total initiative number activate all figures and then follow by players with the next highest total number, players activate their figures based on order of the initiative number.  If there is a tie, the player the first player will go first.

ANOTHER VARIANT
Early boost and equipment, each player will have a certain number of Kama points which they can spend, then they draft the reward tiles until each players get five tiles.  They can use the Kama points to spend on those equipment and any Kama points remaining will be translated to Kama tokens where players can keep to use in the later game play.

KAMA VARIANT
For each Kama a player gathers, they get additional Kama.  This can accelerate the Kama accumulation and allow players to easily purchase boost, buff, and other permanent rewards.

Nice skirmish game. I love the feeling of a MMOBA (massive multiplayer online battle arena - like Heroes of Newerth, DOTA) and these cutesy but vicious characters.
But the cardboard quality is questionable...while punching the parts I almost ripped one apart although I handle my games with the greatest attention imagineable. And putting together the boxes is just a joke. The parts don't even fit!

Reminds me of a video game.
Pretty cool, and very nice components.

Very enjoyable.  And.....cute?...did I just say that?...weird but true.

I've been a fan of Skirmish games such as Heroclix, Starwars/D&D Minis, Monsterpocalypse, etc.
Also Animes, and Final Fantasy Tactics, etc.

So I do like this game alot.
Most of the games I've had have been fairly close as well, so I think it's fairly balanced.
Though there have been some issues when some of the game had been translated to English, but it's still a great game.
(and I don't think it's been anything too major.)

This is absolutely the worst rulebook I've ever read. Rules are given in the tutorial and then not recapitulated in the rules summary, or vice versa, or are contradicted elsewhere in the book. It takes what is actually a very simple game and turns it into a convoluted mess. Of course that's not the only reason I don't like this game, but it's enough to push it from "bad" to "very bad". Will likely not be keeping.

RATING: 5
Preliminary rating after one game with just the base characters. The equipment rewards seem [i]way[/i]better than the temporary rewards. The gameplay is so simple that it could be seen as a simplification of things like Pokemon, Mage Wars, etc. It's so simple I can just tell you: Each side starts with four dudes. On your turn you activate each dude, in initiative order (which does help with AP, since you can't control the order). You use movement points (MP) to move, and action points (AP) to act (each character typically has two things it can do), and you may use them in any order. Actions are typically attacks. There are VP tokens (called GG) and if you knock out an opponent's character, they have to give you three. You can also buy them with money, which you get a couple ways.

Of course the main draw to the game are the fantastic characters. They really are fantastic. However the cardboard popup scenery is atrocious compared to the characters. And in fact the cardboard boxes are a disaster. They're a pain to setup, and they keep falling apart. If I could find the resin scenery for a decent price, I'd probably buy it, despite how insane the total cost of this game would be (I'm already three expansions in, although I expect that will be in, as I'm not a collector).

I would give the game system a 5, but a bump of 1 for resin characters. If I ever get the resin scenery, I might give it another bump of 1, as irrational as that is. Additional play and expansion characters may also improve the rating.

Always reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics with awesome minis and art. Not just for Kids, actually I would say it is a bit complex for kids younger than 12 or so. Pretty family friendly although there is some blood shown in some of the art. I really enjoy this game every time I play it. It is not super heavy but there is a lot going on and can be a bit much for a new player...However...The instruction manual is fantastic. it has a full tutorial that will take you through each phase and the characters abilities. it doesn't cover 100% but it takes you to about 90% on game play. I would highly recommend playing through the entire tutorial with a new player especially one that hasn't played games like this before. Be careful also, the art and minis are super cute and they will make you want to buy every expansion. I have been good so far and have only purchased the base game, we will see if I can hold out.

This game reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics.  I am able to play with both my wife and kids.  Building your force with the different synergies is almost as much fun as playing.  The cardboard terrain can be frustrating to assemble; the upgraded resin terrain is gorgeous and highly recommended.  Unfortunately, they have started blind boxes only for figure collection, making this a pricey game to have all of the figures.  If you accept this going in, you won't be disappointed.

Picked this up from Miniature Market during a sale in September of 2013.  I wasn't sure how Jen was going to like it, but after running through the first three tutorial scenarios, I think that I'll at least be able to get this to the table once in a while.  I showed it to my 7 and 4 year old nephews and they instantly fell in love with it ... once I get a few more plays under my belt I may see how they handle some simplified gameplay and hopefully not break any of the miniatures.

RATING: 7.5
This is a game that I unfortunately don't get to play terribly often.  The set up of the game takes a little bit of time and the rules are a little hard to remember if you don't play often.  This game has a very niche audience, one that seems to be lacking in my area.  I bring it with me wherever I go, but it rarely gets played.

I always enjoy playing it when I can, and have found that when people give it a chance that they agree that it is really fun.  That being said, after awhile you get this feeling that you need more.  Well, there are expansions for this game!  Wait a second though, they are very expensive.  For $20-$30 you can get one of the expansions, which comes with 4 new figures and a few tokens.  And then once you've play out those characters you need more.  It's very much like Spyro: Skylanders in the way that you get addicted to buying all of the figures.

That being said, I do recommend trying this game, but understand that if you buy it, you'll probably want to set a good amount of money aside to get the expansions.

I really hate to rate this game a 6.5, which isn't a bad rating, but ...

It is an interesting tactical game, I like the different characters and their very different abilities.  Needless to say, it is visually stunning - the minis, trees, shrubs, gold coins sprinkled over the board.  It's definitely one of the most eye-grabbing games.  

I was interested and intrigued during the first 5 or so game plays.  But then I just didn't have much desire to keep going back to it, despite the awesome components.  

In the end I found only 2 or so characters unique enough to be interesting (the one with the huge range and the one with the major heal ability).  The game just felt flat or something.  Its hard to describe, but my lack of interest in breaking out such a gorgeous game is testament to something.  

Its like being presented with a layered wedding cake.  But in the end, it's just a slice of cake.

I kickstarted this in early 2013.

Fairly disappointed by a two month delay and the fact that the game was being sold at Gencon prior to receipt by backers. Not the first time this has happened. I think it's exteremely disrespectful to kickstarter backers - they ought to get the game before anyone else. I won't be participating in any further Japanime KS campaigns and won't be buying any of the expansions.

Yet to play, but looks like a lot of fun.

Basically Final Fantasy Tactics the board game. Some aspects are overly fiddly for my taste, but it's easy for me to leave these parts out if I need to.

This one is so much Fun! The minis are wonderfully well painted and the battles are fun and strategic. The demonic reward system helps to keep it fresh, and with each new thing they add, they address core problems the original had, which is saying something because they weren't really that bad. Two detractors- It's a money pit. Worse than Heroscape was. The other, all the exclusives. Screw that. I don't feel special because I have some. I feel excluded that I can't get them without turning a money pit into a money monster, or running around the world to cons.

Don't let the cuteness fool you!  There's a lot of depth in this game.  The components are fantastic, and there's a tonne of strategy - just an overall fun game.  Definitely has a video game feel to it.

I would probably rank it even higher, but there's no way I could give a 10 to a game that has so many figures, expansions, etc., that are promo only.  There are plenty of regular off-the-shelf expansions, enough to satisfy for sure, but I would prefer it if everything was commonly available.

Krosmaster: Arena is a light skirmish game. It's a decent game system but at least with the base characters it seems to me that there is a severely limited set of tactical options. It mostly comes down to cpncentrating fire on one of the enemy characters and then hoping for the best while your opponent does the same to you. As only few dice are being rolled each time they result in a pretty high variance. I guess I'd prefer a system with more constraints that would actually allow for meaningful tactical choices.

The miniatures sure are purty, though.

 I really enjoy a tactical combat game. And this is a well honed game(it started out as a video game) with high quality components, a moderate to easy level of entry(it has a tutorial) really makes for a visually stunning and thoroughly fun game.  One caveat; you have to like the cute-chibi like appearance of the art & pre-painted figures.

Go for the throat skirmish game. Core game play without cute minis is a 6 but minis are so well done and cute it gives it a +1 for fun. Uses a you move then I move system so going before the other player is a big advantage. It's really a 2-player game with some kludgey tinkering to make it 4-player.

Components are excellent and the rules are solid and very well presented - top marks.

Game play though, I would suggest that as a wargamer you will likley be, well, not exactly disappointed, but the game is lite with 100% open information and zero reactions - play is all about positioning and basically you will focus your hits on one opposing model (most likley the one with the least health points) and then watch while your opponent does the same to one of yours. There is the (limited) ability to synergise the abilities of your Krosmasters and abilities can also be enhanced by buying rewards in-game. You can even use Kama tokens (the in-game money) to steal VP tokens off your opponent and there is a mechanism within the game that reduces the available poole of VP tokens to hurry you along. But despite all that, the game is I go, roll dice, you go, roll dice. 

This is a good, solid game with high "cute" visual appeal but I question it's long term replayability - even with the added minis which do add another level of meta-gaming in putting together your own warbands.

My goodness, I sound very hard to please. 

Set-up is less difficult than a game of Battlelore.

This is a tough game to learn but the manual helps with tutorials. Definitely start with them. The game play was fairly simple but there is a lot going on and a lot of procedures to remember. The more we play the more we enjoy the game. Long range attacks, locking characters in place so they can't escape, the dice play and characters make this a game worth learning. Just give yourself a couple of hours for the first time.

RATING: 7
I have played Krosmaster online and also played it once physically at a gamestore. I REALLY enjoyed the gameplay and have several times almost bought it but have passed on it for two reasons:

1. I just really HATE the miniatures and the art. I would be embarrassed to pull this game out with my normal game group solely based on its art style. The art would be great for a game I would play with my young nephew and niece, but the gameplay is too difficult for their age group. So this game isn't appropriate for my strategy loving adult gamer friends thanks to its art, and not appropriate for younger kids because it is too complicated for them. With a more appropriate art style and theme, this game would be a winner.

2. Kickstarter exclusives. There are just way too many kickstarter exclusives for this game that are impossible to get. I really dislike games that do this since it irks me that I can't get large segments of the game since I missed the kickstarter.

I really love the arena concept and all of the mechanics put into this game and how they create the flow in it. It is a pain in the butt to set up but once it is set up it's so fun to play. No game will ever be the same, there are too many random elements for it to play out the same twice regardless of the team comp. The game is challenging and always a learning experience. Learning the value of each component is very inmportant, all around a solid game.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2013)

GORGEOUS game. I love tactical 2 player games so I like Krosmaster, however I feel this is a light game but being so beautiful tricked me into wanting to play it again (and maybe buy it). The game production values are off the chart, the components are GREAT, however I don’t dig the style of the minis and art. The game is simple enough and easy to teach. It doesn’t take too long to play it. Best with 2 players but I also dig 4 players with teams. 

Its main strength are the gorgeous components, not sure if the game is deep enough to satisfy me as it seems lighter that I usually enjoy. For now I want to play it again but I prefer to play Mage Wars and/or Earth Reborn over this one. This is similar to Super Dungeon Explore, but still I prefer to play it over Krosmaster.

If it weren’t for the great components, I would rate this a 5.0 or lower.

It’s been a long time since I last played Krosmater: Arena and my desire to do so is decreasing over time. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating. I’m not sure if the game has enough depth and, more likely, I won’t get the plays need to verify this point.

I missed the Kickstarter for this, but I demoed it and bought it at GenCon '13 with some promos thrown in. I knew nothing about the Krosmaster universe before I played this game, so the characters don't mean anything to me. This is a great skirmish game with fantastic miniatures and great components. The characters are pretty different amongst themselves and provide a lot of variety in play styles.

RATING: 5
Components are excellent.  Only really works as a 2 player game.  Replay value is limited since the strategy is essentially the same every game; you and your opponent just attack each other's weakest character with the winner almost always being the guy that succeeds first. Game is also a money sink and it is only made worse by limited/promo characters and components.

I kickstarted this at the $500 level, but got cold feet and backed out at the last minute. After buying the base game for $50, and playing it only once so far, I regret my decision to back out 100%. This game is exactly the game I was hoping for. A tense, fun, and neat looking tactical game. Hits on all cylinders for me. Now time to start buying up all the expansions.

2015-05-01: Initial rating as 7. I don't really see this changing. It is obviously well-designed and balanced. I walked my kids through a single mission of Krosmaster Junior, using my game shop's library copy. This was the first time I played the real version, and the game was with an expert player who gives demos of the game weekly. The game ran a little long for me, but overall had some really excellent options and combos and the game mechanics after 1 game seem easy to remember and teach.

A fairly typical skirmish ruleset with some sprinkling of RPG elements. Players control Krosmasters who use their AP every turn to attack and try to kill other Krosmasters. There are some differences from other games in the same genre, such as the ability to summon other figures and using coins to "shop" for weapons.

Components are amazing. The 3D terrain looks great but the star is definitely the chibi miniatures. Well painted, and looks great and has a great heft to them.

This game is probably as close to a miniature game as I'd like to get involved in.  I'm usually shying away from miniature games because my group aren't miniature game players nor do they like complex rules.  I also don't like the cost investment to make the most out of them.

The difference in this game is the entry price point, and the seemingly easy rule set.  The components are top notch, but I gotta say, the insert the game comes with loosely packs the figures and they can (my Queen of Tofus) rub against the black insert and discolor the figures.  Still, I'd consider this a one off, but even repacking the game after a play can see this issue crop up.  I'd suggest storing the figures with alternative methods.  Which will then eat in to the price of the game...

Well, the good part about this game is that the components are probably good looking enough that it draws a crowd that normally wouldn't be interested in a genre of game like this one is in.  I'm proof of that.  The play time also isn't long, and there are no real life measuring tools needed to move units and to attack.

There is one caveat to the rule set that I'm not particularly fond of though.  The line of sight mechanics of this game is a bit tough to judge correctly.  Without visiting a website that calculates it for you, during a casual play with non-miniature players, this can turn them (and myself) away from future plays alone.  With a character like Bill Tell that can shoot up to 11 spaces, without a clear sense of the line of sight, it leaves much to be desired on where he can and can't hit.  So with that, I find that the game lacks a lot to help players pace through a game without having to rely on constant breaks to search for the LoS results online.

The other thing I'm not to happy about are the boxes that come with the game that you have to setup as terrain.  These things require glue to hold or else they're useless.  Frigost expansion has better boxes that hold well without glue, and it isn't a major issue, but for people that might not want to glue their pieces, it can be a detraction for sure.  I've made a couple of small sticky finger marks on my terrain boxes than I like.

Overall, I think the game has huge potential, and I think ultimately, if we play a map enough, we'll find out where the LoS spots ideally would be for Bill Tell, so hopefully with more plays the game gets better.  The components can only go so far to carry this game.

I'm scoring it a 6 as it is one of the easier miniature games to get into still, and cost is of good value.  However, with a dodgy LoS rule set, it leaves me in a weird spot where I don't want to show this game to someone if I know LoS debates will be an issue.  It'll turn into a waste of time teaching them the game, and a waste of time playing it.  So ultimately, I'll have a very very limited group I can play with and thus it'll hold a lower score despite the fact that I absolutely adore this game in my collection (along with its many expansions).

This game has it all in design! From 3D aspects to adorable painted miniatures! This is a PVP game that you gather an army and go against the other player the last one left standing is the victor. This game is a little like heroclix but 1000xs better in design and gameplay. It's very straight forward in how to play and no massive list of abilities you have to keep straight. Each character has its own ability and special actions it can take. I LOVE LOVE THIS GAME!

Krosmaster: Arena is a player-vs-player, tactical card game with anime-style miniatures that offers the craftiest tacticians among you the chance to challenge other players to heated battles in arenas scattered around Hormonde. All players build their team using a pre-determined method, whether a point system, draft, or at random. Equip your team with spells, weapons and other items adapted to their requirements, then utilize their various talents and abilities to create a powerful fighting force. Every figure has a point value attached to it to help balance things out. Randomly drawn event cards spice up the game at each turn, and the winning conditions differ for each game based on the scenario you choose to play. Only those who are able to create a strong, yet versatile, strategy will prevail!

Good review: http://www.noobsource.com/krosmaster-arena-review/
They said: At first, the game can seem quite intimidating, especially when it comes to managing multiple minis, each with completely different sets of abilities. Not to worry, because Ankama has just the solution. Included in the game manual are six interactive tutorials that you can play alone or with a friend. Each tutorial is designed to focus on a specific game mechanic so by the time you’ve finished each of the tutorials, you will have a good understanding of how the game is played. While these tutorials are completely optional, I highly recommend playing through them at least once because they’re just as fun to play and act as a good refresher if you haven’t played in a while.

Very nice skirmishing game. The miniatures look great and the bits you use for the board add a lot to make the game look and feel great. If you intend to play it casually with friends, the base set and a few more miniatures will give you a lot of possible combos and many hours of fun. The problem is, if you want to be competitive, it's a money sink, just like TCGs/CCGs. The tension mechanism helps preventing the game from dragging when players want to play too cautiously or passively.

Super neat tactical game with fantastic components and enjoyable strategic play.  My kids (9 and 11) love this, largely due to the beautiful miniatures, but we have a great time putting together teams and playing as well.  A bit of a learning curve with lots of unique terminology, so a nice reference card with the main items would be helpful, but it's not too bad especially if you just stick with the base game and maybe a few extra figures.  New seasons and expansions seem to add more new abilities which is more to keep track of if you don't play regularly.  The training scenarios in the rulebook are an amazing idea.

French game by Ankama.

Not every playable characters (krosmasters) are well balanced, but the game itself is very interesting.

Make sure to be "up to date" with the last gaming rules (on the official website), to be in the competitive part of the game.
These rules improve the game by "patching" the weakness of some part of the original game-design.

The game can be played at different levels, like casual or competitor.

Very accessible but surprisingly deep skirmish tactics game. There's not much randomness in the combat resolution which means you have to be very strategic in your movement, team makeup, and how you use each round. A near-perfect mix of accessibility and strategy. You don't need to spend time and money painting, and the visuals mean that you can convince people who might otherwise not give a skirmish game a try to play this.

The only reason I don't give it a perfect score is that out of the box, the game is not quite as complex as when you start adding in some expansions.

Krosmaster:Arena ist ein 2-Personen Spiel, bei dem sich die Spieler mit ihren ausgewählten Kämpfern, ordentlich auf die Mütze geben. Wer also nicht so sehr auf Konfrontation steht: Das ist das falsche Spiel für Euch :-) 
Kormaster Arena hat ein wirklich tolles Spielmaterial. Ein hübsches Spielbrett, mit 3D Material, unglaulich viele Karten und Token und natürlich die Spielfiguren. Diese gehören mit ihrem überzeichneten, niedlichen Design zur Spitzenklasse. Sie sehen so gut aus, dass man sie sich sogar ins Regal stellen möchte. Also Optik: 10 Punkte. 
Das Spiel selbst ist wie bereits gesagt auf Konfrontation aus. Die Spieler bewegen ihre Figuren durch die Arena und können bei entsprechender Reichweite zum Gegner Angriffe ausführen. Angreifer und Verteidiger müssen Würfel werfen, um den Schaden zu bestimmen. Hier haben wir natürlich einen sehr hohen Glücksfaktor, der ledier manchmal Spielentscheidend sein kann. Sammelt man das, auf dem Spielbrett liegende, Gold ein kann man Austüstungen kaufen. Krosmaster Arena macht schon eine Menge Laune, aber man muss bereit sei den hohen Glücksafaktor und die unterschiedlich starken Figuren zu akzeptieren.

Krosmaster es uno de los juegos más competitivos que he jugado. Rápidamente puedes aprender como se juega pero otra cosa es llegar a dominarlo, una vez que terminas una partida ya estas listo para volverlo a jugar.
Claramente está diseñado para 2 personas y jugarlo hasta el cansancio. El hecho de comprar jugadores y utilizarlos para combinar nuevos equipos lo hacen un juego muy lucrativo. De hecho cuando lo compré, a la semana ya tenía 50 krosmasters! jajajaja :D pero finalmente eso es el aspecto negativo del juego.
A la fecha hay 3 temporadas y como los juegos de cartas que cada temporada hay nuevas que aparecen y cambian algunos aspectos del juego, esto lo tiene igual y eso hace que tal vez te llegue a cansar. 
Porque no un 8 o un 9, primero porque llega a ser muy simple en algún momento y si no tienes nuevos krosmasters que agreguen variables al juego, llega a ser muy predecible. Y 2do porque es muy simple de desbalancear, si logras elegir o si tienes buenos krosmasters, es casi imposible ganar si es que no tienes un equipo equivalente o mejor.

At first glance the game is in the Top-10 of the best productions for its components.
In gaming mechanics, nothing new or special, but surely does what it's made to offer. PvP battle which gets much better in team play.
I think that the many expansions can give it a chance to shine, but the price of each expansion pack makes it prohibitive.

Loved the anime pieces and the map + treasure/loot on it. I wish loot was a bit easier to set up though and it was a more tactical game than I'd've liked. (I'm not a fan of tactics too much - I prefer strategy) It was also a bit confusing some rules. I wish it did more than two players.

A fantastic, colorful arena battle game. The game features a great meta game system of team building and combo/synergy finding, and then brings it all to life with fun, cartoon style arenas and items.

It looks like a simpler version of final fantasy tactics, and it plays that way too.  I love the components and the first few plays were better than what I expected.  The rules are very simple, and the online version is available to settle any confusion.  The bonus of the online play itself is a huge boost the value here.  Playing with random teams and also trying to make teams with stronger synergy have both been really fun so far.

Edit: After about 10-15 games, this game is good.  I love that the upgrades are useful and actually matter.  The online play is excellent.  Even with only the first 26 characters I have already found multiple good teams with different strategies.  This game did an excellent job of adapting a tactics game to the table top, which needed to be simple, and retain lots of strategic depth.  I hope that tournament support actually happens for this game.

Muito bom jogo de combate. Ao contrário da primeira impressão que passa com as miniaturas 'cutes', é um jogo de combate, um wargame tático. Uma boa variação de poderes, mas sendo possível de jogar sem ter que ficar olhando as regras o tempo todo.

Uma das coisas mais interessantes neste jogo é a possibilidade de recuperação de uma equipe que já estava com jogo perdido. O mecanismo de tirar gallons of glory do outro, juntamente com a possibilidade de comprar de recursos extras (artefatos, itens, buffs, boosters) permite viradas incríveis dentro de uma partida.

Recomendo para 14 anos ou mais, assim como jogar pelo menos duas vezes antes de analisar o jogo, pois é na segunda partida, com as regras mais claras na mente, que se tem uma noção melhor e se consegue criar estratégias no jogo, obtendo maior diversão.

Ps: e os componentes são simplesmente fantásticos!!! Recomendo o uso das cartas XL para poder colocar os marcadores sobre elas, e também o uso dos tokens de resina, principalmente dos minions (mobs), pois fica bem melhor de manuseá-los no tabuleiro e de visualizar na criação das estratégias de jogo.

This game caught my attention when it was a Kickstarter (I love beautiful looking games an I like the board, the components and miniatures a lot), but was turned off by the high price. So I was glad that I could try it at the Essen fair of 2013. 

I must say that the game itself was a sort of turn-off for me. I had the feeling that the game was rather playing itself, then I was playing a game where I had to make some hard decisions. 

But to be honest, I probably didn't have the full experience. One of my characters had 'dodge' and an other one 'lock' as special ability, and when I asked what that meant, the demo-lady just told me that they didn't explain that at the fair, but that it doesn't change the game a lot :s

But still, even if there would be a bit more strategic in that way, 50 euro was a bit too expensive for my taste for a game that didn't gave me a good playing experience after all.

This game plays like and has the same feel as a videogame. It reminds me of tactics ogre & Final fantasy tactics feel to it, but on a board game !! Amazing !! The two best tactical RPG strategy videogames ever made. It can be played in about one hour so this is a big plus !!. For all those times when you don't have time to get Heroscape to the table.

Strategies are deep, powers are amazingly varied. The depth of this game relies on how to build your team so that you can apply the strategy you want to take the victory. But building a good team is not enough to win, you need to actually know what to do with said team that you built.

Fun, tactical & strategic, engaging, exciting, short, lots of depth and the miniatures are gorgeous !!

What more can you ask ?

[*]  It's ok. I'd say it is more a game of diversity, where you have to buy new packs to keep it fresh, than one of quality of design, where the game system is solid and great by itself. I doubt you'd play that game with abstract pieces representing the various characters, which makes me feel they worked more on the aesthetics than on the gameplay. Honestly you're probably better off using the video game version of this one.

RATING: 8
Fun and short tactical miniatures game. Aside from being really cute, the rules are simple yet offer a lot of choices in a really refreshing way. While dice are used in combat, the attacks have a base damage to them, which helps reduce randomness.

Again, the figures aren't completely balanced, but it's reasonably close. If every player picks equal numbers of figures by matching point costs per figure, things work well. (I mean to say two 3 point guys don't always equal a 6 point guy.) After just a few plays, you will want to get a handful of expansion figures to keep things lively, as there aren't really enough included in the base game for good variation.

While most of the production value here is crazy good, the cardboard crates in the base game barely hold together.  Also, I do wish the figures activated as they do in heroscape, rather than have player A resolve all his units, before player B acts.

While we're on the topic, these figures work fantastically well on a heroscape map.

10/20 - I upgraded this game to a 10.  I love the challenge the different characters bring to the game.  They also bring a bit a variety to the game whether you have tank / melee or range / support type games.  Still fine tuning the rules though.  Some questions we're working out.

Very Chess-like game with some fantasy thrown in.  Variety comes from the various characters.  I think I need at least one more of the expansion packs to make give it a bit of variety.  Instruction book is big, but it has step by step mini games that help you learn.  Setup and play isn't too bad.  Game was about an hour because it was our first one and we kept referring to the rule book.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Great little tactics game, and I've only played through the tutorials.

The tutorials are great. The rulebook teaches the game a little at a time and each section has a "board" printed right on the page. You literally play each tutorial scenario right on the rulebook with the rules on the adjacent page. Brilliant.

Lavish production, especially with the deluxe bits. Best production value of any game I own, bar none. 

Gameplay is solid. Lightish tactical game with a cool little learning curve -- despite simple gameplay little tricks can go a long way, and valuation of demonic rewards is important, and good positioning is mandatory. It's gorgeous, a blast to play, and simple setup and rules -- a rarity for games with great components. With all of those qualities how can I rate it any lower?

(4 Design + 4 Enjoyment)

Why Design Rating isn't Maxed Out: Poor distribution by the company (too many limited promo figures, which I do own), and balance issues

* Game has decided to go with random distribution of figures now, so it's pretty much dead to me going forward, but the stuff I own from before the distribution change is still beautiful and fun. Kinda glad there is a solid "end point", too (considered by me to be at the point they changed the distribution model)

Kind of mildly obsessed with this game currently. If it weren't for the ridiculously expensive 'collectable' aspect of this game (some figures being exclusive kickstarter rewards and things selling for insane amounts on ebay etc.) this would be a 10 for me. It's a beautiful, simple, fun game with actual tactics and a bit of luck. The figures are varied and interesting and the board and pieces are of amazing quality. It's just sooo expensive to get into...

Absolutely blown away by this game. I backed it at the $500 level and initially felt like I wasn't going to be getting value for money. I decided not to downgrade my pledge, and I'm glad I didn't. I was totally wrong. The figurines are huge and they are amazing! Even the cardboard terrain pieces are gorgeous - just like in all the Kickstarter photos.

The game itself is like a tactical beat em up. Players make teams then go forth to fight one another, summon creatures and gather money for upgrades. It's an absolutely joyful PvP experience. Everything felt intuitive.

The tutorials in the rulebook were an awesome idea! Made learning the rules easy peasy.

2 plays: one of the tutorials, and basic scenario

It's a miniatures tactical game with REALLY cute miniatures. But I'm not into these games -- find myself annoyed with all the dice rolls (there are a lot), with trying to figure out how to move tactically, and the rules complexity when you add multiple different types of units with unique abilities and powers. Oh, and how annoying is line of sight?! 

This isn't particularly difficult ... it's just not that much fun. I'd much rather play Heroscape, which I think has the right level of complexity for me.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
(From curtc's post): Each side starts with four dudes. On your turn you activate each dude, in initiative order (which does help with AP, since you can't control the order). You use movement points (MP) to move, and action points (AP) to act (each character typically has two things it can do), and you may use them in any order. Actions are typically attacks. There are VP tokens (called GG) and if you knock out an opponent's character, they have to give you three. You can also buy them with money, which you get a couple ways.

This game really sold itself to me on the back of the cute as hell pre-painted chibi miniatures used to play the game.  The whole game has a very cute, anime art style that is very pleasing to the eye and makes you just want to collect and display everything...which I did (collect everything anyway).

The game itself though is a little lighter than I typically like.  It is played by choosing a team of characters each with different powers and stats and playing a strategic combat game on a square grid that typically ends after killing some number of the other player's characters.

More powerful characters cost more points to the total you're allowed to have on one team and the board has currency you can collect to buy items to equip on your characters and make them more powerful.

One of the saving graces to this game (aside from the cute figures) is the amount of content available.  Many of the powers are very similar making it not as diverse as I would like but there are some creative powers and combinations available to play with.

Despite how beautiful the miniatures are I was a little disappointed at the laziness of the character design.  Many of the characters released are essentially reskins of other characters.

In the end though the lightness of the game also makes it very accessible and customizability at that game weight is rare so it is a nice thing to have when I want to play this kind of game but can't really spring something like Duel of Ages on a person.

Simple arena combat game based on elements of the Dofus/Wakfu MMORPG universe, which I know nothing about other than that it peddles pay-to-play crack to children and has, in France, expanded that empire into other media in the same manner as other merchandise-driven universes (Pokemon, Transformers etc.). It comes as no surprise that Krosmaster: Arena is a collectible game and appears to exist primarily to encourage the purchase of hundreds of palette-shifted figurines.

Each player has four units ("krosmasters") with a number of action points to spend on both generic activities (e.g. punch, 5AP) and various unique "spells". The arena is littered with coins, which can be picked up (1AP) and spent (1AP) for boosts of various duration. VP tokens can be either purchased or won by knocking out enemy krosmasters; tokens so acquired are taken from the opponent and the game ends when one player runs out.

Most conflict is resolved with additional swing from dice rolls, e.g. with every attack the attacker rolls a critical hit die and a 5-6 result adds one damage. Keyword abilities generally add additional dice to these rolls (critical hit to attack, armour to defense rolls etc.), which all work the same way.

It's not a satisfying strategy experience. Individual krosmasters somehow manage to do too much and also not enough (movement range is particularly frustrating), in part because the variance of the dice is so high and so uncontrollable. A character may unexpectedly do fatal damage or no damage whatsoever. Additional randomness comes from the tokens available for purchase, which are highly situational. The variety from additional krosmasters would be welcome but the core engine isn't good enough for it to be worth the effort.

RATING: N/A
Good theme play.  Easy to learn but takes a couple of plays to learn tactics.  Each character plays differently.  Fast paced game.  Components are excellent - mounted two-sided board with colorful artwork and glossy finish, thick cardboard tokens, custom plastic dice and, fully assembled and painted miniatures.  The rulebook is in full color with many tutorials, but is still unclear on a few points.  Game time is about an hour, but feels short.

It's genuinely difficult to rate this game without the components having a major impact.

As a tactical skirmish game this is decent. It's also unspectacular. I have Tank on Tank which does the same thing (but only for 2 players) and was a third of the price of this, so are the figures, 3D trees and crates worth the extra money? I'd really have to say no. It also has some appalling design choices with a lot of icons being so tiny, half our table was struggling to see them in the pub we were playing in.

I'm curious to see how much this is still being played a year or two from now, though I don't doubt an expansion will follow very shortly while the game is still in people's minds and on their tables. I don't really expect it to stay there for that long.

There's a lot going on, so it can be pretty complicated, but there's only a limited number of things you can do at any one time making it easier to pick it up as you go.

Also the "tutorial" games are pretty dull, so if you can skip them do so. You don't want to wear out your other half's patience before the main event.

Try playing the online version to get a good feel for the rules and then just play through a real game (maybe without the Demon shop).

So far so good. However, it seems like a lot of the decisions are fairly obvious, and unless you get a good mix of characters, games can turn into just a slugfest. If you have mainly melee fighters, for example, you'll usually just run up to the closest enemy and start hitting. The gameplay is fun, but will have to see how these issues hold up after more plays.

Update: I still like the game and think it has real potential, but it does seem like there are some real balance issues and some people I play with just don't like this game.

Cute, fun, tactical combat game. The visuals are great and honestly are what really make this game shine...it would lose so much appeal if you played with cardboard chits instead of the chibi figurines. Still, there's a fun game underneath the aesthetics, though for how simple the game is, there are a lot of fiddly rules, making it a bit hard to teach.

Krosmaster Arena is not a simple game. The first time we played it, there were a lot of keywords and special icons to learn. All the rules are quite intuitive, however, and therefore easy to remember. What we have here, is an arena-style game with top notch components and artwork. Its expansions ensure replayability by enabling players to experiment with different team compositions. It holds a unique spot in my collection, and my son (age 11) and I love it.

JON WANTS TO TRIAGE GAME. WON'T EARN PERMANENT PLACE UNTIL WE'VE PLAYED TUTORIAL.

This is Final Fantasy Tactics, Crystal Warriors, Etc. the board game. Get a little squad of characters with different powers and have them slug it out on a small hex board. All the characters play very different. The Queen of Tofus summons little birds that mob/block her enemies. Anna Tommy swaps places with allies and enemy figures. Bill Tell is fragile, but can shoot across the board. The King of the Gobballs is a melee character with a melee familiar (Gobball) that he summons to block in opposing characters while he hacks them to death with strong attacks. 

The components are absolutely gorgeous. The figures are collectible and beautiful even without the game, and the three-dimensional trees are amazing. It's the game that Super Dungeon Explore wanted to be, but wasn't. 

I played it eleven times on the weekend it arrived, mostly playing tutorial scenarios again and again. If you ever loved Japanese Nintendo strategy games, this game is for you.

The long-term replayability doubtless depends on the collectible expansion packs, each with four characters. Wish I'd kickstarted this game now for the promo characters and resin trees.

Good, tactical skirmish game although first-time/casual players will not know the different characters and how to put a good team together.

4-player free-for-all game - rating: 5
Does not really work. Sloppy part-broken rules (GG are meaningless which the rulebook does not realize or cannot be bothered to note). Too much downtime. Too much ganging up two or three on one with little chance of defending yourself or escaping.

In any case vastly better, both components and gameplay, than Super Dungeon Explorer.

I was a little disappointed with this one. The miniatures are adorable and they certainly grabbed my attention, but holy cow does this play slow. Most of the characters have game effects that seem to focus on making the game run too long. Some of them spit out token creatures more or less for free every turn, healing effects are ridiculously strong compared to damage output and there just didn't seem to be any impetus to move because the ranged guys have really long reach.

Some of this might be less of an issue with a bunch of expansions and more experience with the game, but I just didn't find anything engaging in my playthrough. It felt too complicated to be a gateway miniatures game but not deep enough to be attractive to experienced miniatures gamers. Also, as I mentioned earlier it gets really frustrating rolling a bunch of dice and consulting two wordy card abilities to do one point of damage.

Cute, but this won't be around in a year or two.

RATING: 7.8
Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics?
Well this is basically the table version.

Just figure chess with variable powers and terrain.

Despite the look the depth is totally there
reasonably fast game length and setup.

Dices are more than manageable (people who hate the game due to dices would hate ANY game for dices since it masterfully balance fixed damage with mostly predictable chances and dices are also manageable)

You can get many extra characters extra cheap so the collector part is not harsh at all. 

Usual list of cons i write for all games:
-Absolute awful characters balance...this manages alone to ruin the game unless you manage to houserule the team choice.
-I hate miniature style with passion
-Lot of skills requiring lot of rules
-official rule revision are sometimes debatable (see summoning rule)
-terrains unassemble to easily if you don t use tape or glue and are not easy to assemble.


Premium pro:
It has the best engineered box (i still hate the artwork) ever seen in a game.
Everything fits nicely and stays in place...

Cute anime done right.  FANTASTIC production value even without the resin terrain or bits but better with.  Excellent tactical combat based on card abilities and dice results.  Times out about right allowing for a quick game or more games in a night.  Lots of variety in characters, even if you only got the base game and promos through the KS.

The components of this game are really, stinkin' cute.  

The game itself isn't bad either if you treat it like the luck driven, light introduction to tactical miniatures game that it is.  Special abilities and power ups are nice icing on the cake, but the main game should be won by whoever better focuses their forces to take out the other guys... and rolls better dice.

If I'm going to take this much setup time for a game with gamers I'd rather play something a bit more complex... but for young gamers and folks interested in a light, dicey romp this is pretty fun stuff.

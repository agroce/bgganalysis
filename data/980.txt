Falls solidly in the "oh, well" category.

RATING: 5
Mechanically works like a charm. But that is all the game has to offer. It lacks the very best part of Bohnanza which is trading with other players. Al Cabohne is an excellent exercise on the mechanical part of hand management which is crucial in Bohnanza as well. Of course there are differences between the two but at least Al Cabohne teaches you to rid yourself with the unwanted cards before you must plant them and discard your precious high value beans.

So in a nutshell, Al Cabohne is a mechanical exercise and could provide some fun on those idling days. Bonus points for the solo variant.

One of the "not so good" expansions of Bohnanza. It adds a solo-variant, but it somehow shows that making too much expansions for a game only because the base game was good isnt a good idea.

A two player and soltaire varriant of the popular Bohnanza series. Al Cabohne has fewer flavors of beans, meaning that there's more luck in pulling beans back from the discard. And too many other two player games out there....

Like this a lot. Similar to Bohnanza, but with a few interesting twists. Beating the Mafia is challenging, but using rules by Liumas, we are holding our own. We have learned some tricks to keep the Mafia from earning more thalers.

Recently we added the Prohibohn expansion and like it. As with High Bohn Plus for Bohnanza, it gives more depth to the game. This expansion provides lots more tactical choices, which we like. 

Extra copy is for trade.

Bohnanza is not so fun for one, even with modified rules and such.  There are many card solitaires I prefer (up to and including Sid Sackson's Bowling solitaire) that are not as mechanic.  I have never played two-player.

Traded away in combination with Deadwood + expansions for Jambo.

Interesting variant on the Bohnanza game. Game is however very procedural and seems unnatural when you're used to the normal game. Greatest complaint is that there is no trading and dealing in this variant which is in my opinion the heart of the normal game.

RATING: 4
Bohnanza is such a great game, but as a trading game it doesn't work with 2-players.

The idea is that this is semi co-cop: you need to work together to beat the strawman mafia player, but you still need to get more points than the other player. This may sound okay in theory, but didn't really work for us. Maybe I'm missing something but it almost always seems obvious what to do on your turn. Only very rarely you have to decide between keeping a bad card or giving it to the mafia.

The cards returning from the discard pile can mean that another player collects all the beans just harvested the previous turn which makes this more luck dependent than it'd need to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The jury's still out.  Bohnanza for 2 with a weird semi-co-op dynamic.  Lacks the frantic negotiating of the original which, after all, is the reason people pick up Bohnanza in the first place.

As a solo game, this is pretty fun! There's no real trading of course (you can donate cards to the bean mafia), but there's some of the same pressure as Bohnanza. It's one of the better solo games I've played. Which is not saying much, but still better than nothing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Forgettable, like all too many of the Bonanza expansions.  Other than the original expansion, which makes the game payable with more players, too few of them add much and I've yet to find one I'd consider essential - though, to a large extent, that's a tribute to the quality of the original.

RATING: 6.7
The official rules for a two-player version are nice, although two casual players could enjoy the regular game as well. Only when the players are too concerned about winning, the need for these special rules arises. However, this game adds different strategies to the game for two players. The bad thing is that the interaction between the players is less direct with these rules. Another drawback is that, again, differences with the rules of the regular game may confuse people who already know those. It can be a good idea to make a short overview of the differences with the base game to include in the box if you own and play the regular version more frequently.

The one-player variant is nice, simply because you may not always be able to find other players. The difficulty seems to be too high though: winning the game is usually a matter of starving the bean maffia for beans during most of the game by not having anything left to give them at the point where you are  supposed to. This makes the game repetitive and boring, which is a real pity.

Experience: I developed a partnership with my playing companion to ensure that the mafia did not defeat us both. Same interesting decisions of Bohnanza, but with much less trading.

Rated low only because it removes the central joy of Bohnanza (trading), without adding anything to replace it.

Somehow they made Bohnanza without any trading, and it works (mostly).  The half-competitive/half-cooperate gameplay is fun.  There is some potential for clever play with the Bohnmafiosos.  The game really emphasizes some of the minor aspects of the game, such as managing the discard pile.  I really dislike the swings of luck as one player reaps (no pun intended) the benefits from another player's (or the Mafia's) bean harvest.  It is nowhere as good as straight Bohnanza, but it has its place.

Bohnanza for 1-2 players.  Rules in German--printed English rules from file here on BGG.

High Bohn supposedly the expansion that is "mandatory" for this game--comments say, makes Al Cabohne so much better.  It is also out of print, as this one is.

I don't have many solitaire games and like this one well enough.  Hard to beat the mafia bosses, which wins the game.

The game is similar to two player Bohnanza. The difference is that it adds Mafia, which plants it's own beans and can be used to harm the opponent. By the way, this possibility must not be overused, because in a fight of two, Mafia always wins.

Žaidimas panašus į dviejų žaidėjų Bonanzą. Skirtumas tik tas, kad pridėta Mafija, kuri taip pat augina pupas, ir kuria kartais galima pasinaudoti kad pakenktum priešininkui. Tiesa, persistengti nereikėtų, nes kai du (per daug) pešasi, laimi Mafija.

RATING: 8
Now that I've created my player aids, this game is brilliant, great fun, suddenly playable (went from a 6 to an 8 rating for me!). The only true 2 player in the Bohn universe (La Isla Bohnita works well, though), but yes, the mafia still win at times.

Note: I've managed also to properly translate the rules... The translations on the geek are wrong in places. So... out of the box, won't be an 8 for you, but if you're me, then 8.

[b]Prohibohn[/b] (from High Bohn) is a [b][i]requirement[/i][/b], I tend to forget this is not included in the base Al Cabohne game; this rating encompasses both. Don't bother without the Prohibohn expansion.

Own this as a part of the Ladies & Gangsters box. Nice two-player variant of Bohnanza. Seems a bit complicated at first, but then flows nicely. Losing trading means losing the best part of Bohnanza, but this is ok.

I have plenty of better two-player games, so I wouldn't play this, but looks like my son likes the game, and I have no problem playing this with him.

I don't play solo games, so no comments about that.

Indifferent.

RATING: 7.1
Finally found a copy of this game! A really nice variant for 2-players in playing Bohnanza! The Bean bosses are great and the 2-player game play is fun and strategic! I like playing it just as much as the original 2-player game of Bohnanza. I like the card artwork pretty well...but I am much more of a fan of the original Beans in Bohnanza!

The solo game play is also very fun to play. My wife really enjoys this game, but I am not always in the mood to play. So, the solo game is perfect for her to enjoy Bohnanza by herself. The solo game seems pretty easy to win until you remember to double the gangsters winnings.

Rules:
1. Read 1st page of Solo player rules
2. Draw 7 cards for yourself.
3. Give each gangster there own starting cards, keep drawing until you have 3 different and giving all duplicates to the gangsters.
4. One time through the deck, but must finish through phase 5...redraw as necessary to finish last turn.
5. Double the gangsters coin score.

Al Cabohne is a nice little card game for solo play or 2 player pseudo co-operative (since there will be one winner). It can be interesting if you're a die-hard fan of Bohnanza, and don't have any one to play with, since you actually have to consider some minor decisions before making your move. 

-The rules are not very clear, somewhat clumsy.

The game is very putsy - there is a lot of shifting cards but not much to think about. There are so many 2 player games available that are interesting that this should never see play as 2 player. The solitaire version suffers from what harms all solitaire games - they are 'much ado about nothing'. You go through motions but there is no tension  or fun and it lacks any real strategy. Keep it by the phone for the next time a dull relative calls - it plays well when you're only paying partial attention.

Al Cabohne is badly underrated.  It's a solid two player game for players who like Bohnanza.  The mechanic of having a Bean Mafia adds a bit of tension and conflict as you cannot help the Bean Mafia too much or everyone loses.  Plus, it's a rare solitaire game.

RATING: 6
I wanted this pretty badly, to be able to play Bohnanza as a 2 player game (which is not possible in the Dutch version). 

However, this eliminates all of the great interaction the original game has because there's no trading between players.

I tries to create a semi-cooperative feeling, by pitting the two (or one) players against the Bean Mafia, while still keeping things competitive by letting only one player - the one with the highest score - win.

It was a bit of a 'meh'-experience to me.

Oooh, 1 and 2 player Bohnanza. I need this badly. German only :(

The 2001 German edition of High Bohn (no plus) contains an expansion for Al Cabohne. Le Valet, Fairplay and Adma Speilt have copies.

Josh miller syas:

"Note that there's a critical error in one of the English rules translations: the mafia *never* collects beans off the discard pile. With the correct rule, the bean mafia is tough to beat. If you let them collect discards, they're pretty much impossible to beat."

An attempt to bring Bohnanza to the 1- and 2-player arena.  Bringing sets back from the discard pile provides an unusual strategic element to replace the trading present in Bohnanza.  An okay game, but I think there are much better 1- or 2-player choices available.

Quite fun. Very silly, but that is good. Slightly boring after a while, which is not so good.

Feels more like an REH novel than any other I've played... only from the perspective of the rulers of kingdoms.  Conan storms across the world helping or hindering you.  His quests are all from REH yarns.  
Great replay value.

To me, this is one of those games where you have to play several times to see how the different ages unfold.  Once you appreciate this, there's quite some depth. I agree with those who say it's not 'Conan-y' enough, but for area control I think it's actually a good implementation.

This is a decent game with some very interesting mechanisms. It is  balanced to remain tense and engaging throughout the whole game and requires interesting decisions. It's somewhat low rating lead me to write my very first review here at BGG. Then again, it is not without a few flaws. My rating has dropped to a 7 over time.

RATING: N/A
I'm not familiar with the Conan mythos so I can't say whether this game is true its source. The game is interesting and there are a lot of ways to score and play. The game has its fair share of luck with several decks of cards and practically every action needs a dice roll for resolution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game relies heavily on dice: Your turn action is decided via die roll, combat is decided via die roll, and diplomacy is decided via die roll. There are cards and tokens that allow you to influence the dice, but those are hard to come by. For a conquest game, there is surprisingly little conquering. Heck, there are surprisingly few choices to make!

The sculpts, however, are [b]beautiful[/b]. I want a copy of the game [i]just[/i] for the sculpts -- I can use them in Battlelore. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A decent reasonably confrontational strategy game with a couple of additions that raise it above the crowd.

First is the nice twist on role selection with the dice based phases (7 are rolled for one of five options each - only rerolled when all have been taken) that mean choosing what to do this turn is far more tactical than a simple four way choice would be.

Second is the inclusion of Conan himself as a sort of semi-NPC, causing mischief and trouble throughout the lands as well as providing rich rewards for those who control him - at the possible cost of losing your ability to bid for his control later.

Thirdly unlike, say, Risk, the units available are extremely limited and you have a strict maximum number in any one province at a time - this means deployment and movement needs long term planning.

Of course, there's no way around the fact that if you roll badly in combat you cannot win. You can't.

As I found out today - ouch!

Kickstarter $171 - Barbarian King Level Reward Bundle x 1, and all available add-ons... Bag of King Conan's Coins x 1, Set of Scroll Coins x 1, Set of Skull Coins, & 2 cloth bags.

A pastiche of other games: "Arkham's" multiples of multiple card types, "Risk's" combat, "War of the Ring's" action dice, "Cosmic Encounter's" race-based special abilities, and "Warring States'" meandering expert (here, Conan himself).  The only difference between this game and Frankenstein's creation is the monster achieved life.

After several games I've solidified my gating of this at a 7.  I rarely play aggressively enough to win but it's happenend.

An excellent game with many choices at disposal. War isn't always the best option because it is quite costly.

Much of the chrome included are really good ideas to induce unforeseen effects on the game (e.g. the adventures of Conan).

Dudes on a map, you're competing with armies and emissaries to control the game, while Conan himself serves as a sort of NPC whose adventures can alter the outcome. Some dice chucking and really nice components and a beautiful board, worth checking out if you like Ares' other titles, or some of the Matagot stuff like Kemet and Cyclades.

Gah!  What is this?  You have a very limited number of actions, and you can spin your wheels turn after turn due to bad dice rolls.  Also, controlling Conan the most often wins you the game, making the battles and intrigue a series of distractions.

Edit: After more plays, I find that there is a decent game here, but the theme is really broken.  The Adventure tiles make no thematic sense (why is my empire bragging about all the girls Conan bangs?), but they are a vital part of your strategy.

Edit: The long-overdue expansion has breathed a bit of new life into this one for me.  "Crom! Count the beans!" indeed.

Finally played this correctly (mostly) and we really enjoyed it.  The level of strategy is pretty deep with just enough luck and randomness to keep it interesting.

RATING: 5
while the game was reasonably enjoyable, there are enough problems to wonder why it wasn't developed some more.

- attacking other players seems very disadvantageous.

- you have no control of the type of adventure tokens your strategy is to aim for, you take what comes.

- there have to be severe replayability issues with the game setup identical each game. while the rating is almost 6 after a game, I am almost sure it would be down to 4 by play #3.

- there's seldom a case when taking a conan action isn't the best option, which drives home the feeling of insane randomness and lack of decisions

- the game takes a loooong time, yet you make very few decisions for the time spent

- identical violet figures. they are a huge pain in the ass to differentiate for the owner, and even several factors more so for others. I can't imagne who could have come out with the brilliant idea 3 players have horsemen vs footmen, but violet does not 

If I didn't know better I'd be sure this came out several years earlier than starcraft, and FFG has learned its lesson well in doing starcraft. as it's the other way around I am just mildly surprised this game was pushed for production in the state it's in.

Hi, I am a frequent article writer for Plastic Soldier Review website. I am currently working on a second article about 1:72 figures included in board games. 
This game is on my wish list, but only the figures. The game itself I do not need. 
I am actually looking for the 9  figures from the base set and the 4 figures from the hyboria expansion. Is there anybody who can spare just  1 figure each of the 13 poses? Colour doesn’t matter. I will pay a good price + shipment of course.

RATING: N/A
As I feared based on what I had read about this game, it didn't do much for me.  Not a bad game, but not good enough to make me want to play again.  The start of the game is rather slow as everyone battles their way through neutrals.  The "pool of action dice" mechanic can be highly frustrating when the only actions left to you are actions you don't want or need.  And although I understand that one should trade in adventure tokens for the bonus if you don't think you will have the most of that adventure type, the "reward" for discarding is so minimal that I felt it better to keep the tile and hope I'd get more later (apparently a flawed theory).

Won a copy of this game via a BGG contest. I was very excited because the designers made one of my favorite games, War of the Ring. Now I'm sure I'm not the target audience for this game since I have almost no interest in the Conan world and I'm not a fan of dudes on the map games. In the end we just didn't enjoy the game for these reasons. I didn't despise it and would probably try it with another group, but there is really nothing that makes me want to pull this off the shelf. I would play War of the Ring 1000 out of 1000 times if you asked me to pick one.

I bought this secondhand, and for what it is, I like it. I've never played it with a group though, as the feel I had when playing it solo is that it'd be pretty easy for someone to end up being beaten down and never being able to catch up. As a solo game it was rather satisfying, particularly as there's something in me that really enjoys shoving little soldiers around a board, even if Conan himself doesn't play a big part of the game.

RATING: 6
Being a big fan of Conan, I wanted to love this game so badly. It is a very clever integration of many different mechanics from many very different games - bidding, resource management, area control - all mixed with the spirit of Risk. The game just doesn't end up being as fun as it should be. It's a long game and you find yourself choosing from scarce options to build up a strategy for aggression sometime in mid to late game. Then, it can easily all fall apart with a couple of bad rolls. I understand from reading that this is in keeping with story elements from Conan regarding the plots of the petty princes of Hyborea - but it wasn't fun when it happened to them either. The endgame is resolved with a tally of victory points which seems a hollow, even petty ending for such an investment of time and thought. I admire the promise of the game so much that I hope it can be fixed with an expansion (still waiting for one, less and less hopefully). I still might play it with those who love the theme and some of the game mechanics enough to overlook the game's problems; it's just not what it deserved to be. Though very different in some ways, Chaos in the Old World is a much better realization of much of what this game could have been, I believe.

Had some fun with this game at the lake, but it has not hit the table since.  With Chaos in the Old World and Runewars around, I don't find that AoC adds anything to my collection that I don't get from other games that I enjoy more.  To the trade pile with ye!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Provisional rating - likely to change (just not sure which way yet!)

Very nice bits, and the theme is captured quite well, although I think I'd play WoTR rather than this as a 2 player.

Shared dice pool is a great idea - as a 'bad' roll is shared among all players.

Some differences to the kingdoms is given in the distinct decks, but this could have been expanded. I think the game will get better as all the players get more experienced - it is all about timing, when to do military stuff, when to take cards, when to try for Conan control etc.

Combat favours the attacker - which I like, you are less likely to see players turtling with huge armies in this game, as with the right cards (or Conan) you can rip through a defender fairly easily, in any case there is little downside to losing a province and much to gain from taking one - so you are better attacking and taking something new rather than holding what you have, but it takes a bit for that to sink in.

Inital games take a long time - too long - but as you get familar with the system things will speed up.

Overall, like it.

A weak FF recycling of several previous mechanics in a rather standard conquest game.  The first two-thirds of the game is mostly a solo affair consisting of fighting neutral territories.

RATING: 4.5
Man what a letdown.  I was hoping for a lot since this game came from the same dev team that brought us War of the Ring.  Well they should have thrown WotR out of the window when they designed AoC and started fresh.  Instead AoC feels like its held back by WotR design ideas they were determined to use in their next game.  What we end up with is a slow to develop and stagnant strategic game where the map really dosent change all from the beginning to the end.  Oh and no one gets to be Conan.  There are some good ideas here like terrain modifiers, battle cards to modify what faces of the battle dice are "hits", etc.  But it just wasn't enough to make me think this game is good, or fun.

There's a good Conan game out there.  This isn't it.

Given my love of WotR (from the same design team) and the Conan literature, I thought this would be a big hit with me. Unfortunately I'm disappointed.

Todd's right: not my style of game -- if I have a style.  This is based on one play.  Too long for what one gets out of the game.  The mechanics seem a bit loose and the rules unnecessarily complicated.  Do you really need three different types of battle sequences?  If you drop Conan out of the game, it wouldn't suffer much, so that feels extraneous.  Not sure about the intrigue part.

Impressions after the first game

This game deserves much much better treatment than the one it got. In a world where GoT the board game is number 58 in the bgg, this game just can’t be number 1153. Why? Here’s why

Age of Conan is an empire building game. A slow empire building game, and for what it does it is amazing. While playing the game I truly felt like a king trying to subjugate native tribes in order to expand my empire, while preparing my arsenal during a cold war for the inevitable clash against my opponents, a clash that unlike other games might just happen near the end of the game and will bleed you dry and break your back if you are not careful, just like a true clash between powerful kingdoms should feel.
 Many are control games don’t provide the same kind of campaign system Conan provides in order to militarily conquer neutral land, and honestly this system is a gem, it really provides the player with the feel of how hard it is to take control of indigenous land, and once you do, you get the feeling your domain is more consolidated than in normal are control games. Also the idea that you have two ways to conquer land, whether diplomatically or military is great too. Diplomatical conquest is easier and will bring you some short term benefits, but it might not be nearly as useful in the long term as a military conquest. And this is where the meat of the game comes to me. This game is secretly a game between long term strategic thought against short term tactical thought you can either get resources that might get you victories in te round or get points that might win you the game in the end.
This debate between short term and long term is also present in the economic system of the game. Roughly there are 4 resources in the game,(cards, gold, sorcery and adventure tokens). 3 of these have utility in the inmediate term, during the game rounds(gold, sorcery and the cards), while the other one only really comes to use in three moments of the game(age change and final scoring) and only if you have the most, so if you don’t hoard them correctly they are useless to you. The thing is that you can change this long term resources for short term resources, but only at one moment of the game, when you obtain the tokens. So there you have a moment to measure the utility of one term of the game over the other, this decision is built across in a sense risk management too. Should I take the secure way of getting resources or should I try to hoard the tokens in order to see if I might win in the end?
Talking about risk, the conan bidding system is another excellent piece of hardware. Where again you are measuring risk, should you burn your best strategy card in order to get conan, or should you let other have him and use your card to solve your inmediate military problems. Again you are measuring risks and trying to do the most. Also losing this bids by one or two points when you invested heavily in them is both frustrating and very costly, so the bidding system is really intense, sometimes frenetical and might affect your strategy quite a bit.
Now in age of conan, I heard a ton of people depreciate the value of conan to the game. To be honest conan interferes quite a lot, and not only that, his interferences really affect the game a lot, but conan is a quirurgical knife not a sledgehammer, whoever controls him must againg measure well when and where to use him, the battles in which he takes part must be used for something other than just shock value.
Then there is the destiny dice this pool isn’t as limiting as it seems to the player at first sight, what it does allow is for some old fashioned passive aggression between player, hence providing a more subtle  way of fighting than just throwing dice and kicking them in the gut. Now you can read your opponents plan and deny him the dice he needs to activate them, who knows maybe even in picking that dice he needed you might just help your cause even exponentially, or make an enemy that later might break your back. Then again you are measuring how useful is using a take that mechanic over just living and let live (in all honesty this game could have had some sort of diplomatical alliance system between kingdoms, thot would have made it simply perfect).
Finally I need to talk about the kingdom cards, this should not be underestimated, they bring lore and flavour to the game and every area control game should learn from them. They make Hyperborea feel like a vining zombie horde of people that can take casualties simply because they have reserves, or Aquilonia feel like the better equipped fighting force of pseudo romans that they are. Some are indeed generic but even those generic ones still have some flavour in them, and also the cards in a way tell you how you should run the economy of your kingdom, which resources should you value, sorcery tokens or gold. So yes they are pretty neat.

Well that was a lot of different mechanics(resource management, risk management, bidding, asymmetry, public action pool, public objectives and some good old dice rolling), and to be honest at no point while playing did they feel fiddly at all. Most of them felt pretty thematical and having a place in the game, and those that didn’t appeared to me while I was thinking about this game and I realised their hidden utility. The whole group just combines together in something that feels organic, so not only is this game beautiful to look at, but also a beautiful piece of design rules wise. It is a long, slow game about the hardships of building an empire, of consolidating power, of a cold war followed by an intense clash, a game about calculating, that compensates he who has been the most cerebral, who has seen the better balances and read his opponents better. Age of Conan is a game for kings, not a game for the feeble minded, a game that invites people to invest heart and soul in order to become the ultimate ruler of Hyborea.

RATING: 7
One Play, Four Player (I am a boyhood fan of Conan comic books, so the theme does mean something to me):

Add this one to the list of games I am just not sure about.

I liked a whole lot of the game - Fate dice, Conan, the bidding and adventure tokens, the national decks, and the look and feel of the game.

What I didn't like included the static nature of it... people only rarely had influence in more than four territories, let alone influence outside their colored areas.  There were maybe three fights between player armies - all involving me as Aquilonia.

Campaigning is arduous, which is realistic, which I like, but makes more a slow moving positional situation, which I don't love.  Money was really tight, as cards required cash to play, and cash to reset.  I felt that my choices in the game were somewhat limited.

Positive note - I want to play again.  But, if it goes like this play, I will look to trade.

Wow. This game is a total microwave job; it gives the impression that maybe about 15 minutes of serious design thought went into it. OK, maybe an hour. This is just War of the Ring reformulated for multi-player without, apparently, the slightest concern that multi-player games work differently from 2-player ones.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, our game was won in a walk by the player who didn't do anything. Inter-player combat is so ridiculously expensive, those who engage in it lose. Come on, guys, if you're going to design one of these things, at least *pretend* to tackle that particular problem! It's been addressed so many different ways over the last 30 years that I can't take seriously designers who don't even try.

The other critical problem is that even the narrative is lousy. As the game staggers to conclusion, the tension completely drains out of the game as very little you do adds up to enough to make a difference in the final scoring. So people end up just sitting there praying for the game to end and put them out of their misery. It's not because the game has gone too long, or because the pacing is off or anything, it's simply because instead of building to a climactic final confrontation or something, the life just gets completely sucked out of the game towards the end.

Now, after having just savaged it, I'll say that Conan isn't awful, and it wouldn't be that hard to talk me into playing it again (so, about a 4 rating). If you're going to play this sort of thing, it's better than the overwrought monstrosities like Twilight Imperium or completely non-functional games like Antike which have all the same meta problems but don't play as well. And while the endgame is lousy, the overall length isn't too bad. But, it's not in the same class as the modern games of this sort that basically work: Successors 3 and the two Star Wars Risk games primarily, but also Conquest of Paradise and (sort of) Supernova. Never mind the classics like Titan, Dune, or Risk itself.

It takes only one game to completely assimilate what at first seems like a lot of rules.  All parts of the game flow together seamlessly, creating an epic overall narrative, which has a lot of randomness and great replay value.  I've dropped my rating by half a point due to some vague areas in the rules the designers haven't addressed, then bumped it back up to 9 after a stunning triumph with Stygia.  :-)

RATING: 8
It's a great strategy game based on Conan and the Hyborian Age. There are many paths to victory, not just the military one. Great minis, great art and design... and the game just flows once you get the hang of things.

One caveat: it's really balanced for 4 players... but that could take 4-5 hours to finish a game. To me, 3 players is the sweet spot: enough players to have conflict and makes things unpredictable... and a shorter game (around 3 hours or so). A 2-player game is just a straightforward wargame and can get a bit boring and predictable, even though it's shorter. YMMV. If you don't mind the play length, go for the 4 player game. It's great!

RATING: 7
Age of Conan is a Risk-like area control/combat game.  Each faction is based on a kingdom from the Conan the Barbarian mythos.  The four factions have distinct special abilities, but none feel particularly over-powered compared to others.

Unlike Risk, territories can be "conquered" via diplomacy.  Diplomacy takes less time and fewer resources, but is easier for opponents to undo.

Available player actions are dictated by a dice pool.  One player rolls the dice, and each player takes the die corresponding to their desired action on their turn, limiting the actions available to subsequent players.  Once all dice are used the next player re-rolls them all, and has first pick from the new pool.

Throughout the game Conan himself is questing through players' territories, helping or hindering their plans.  While mostly a thematic component, knowing when and how to control Conan's motions will give you an edge.

The game is slow and lacks player conflict as neutral battles are so much easier and the game never really runs out of neutrals to battle. The quest token system quickly breaks down into each player dominating one field, which in turn means the powers don't change hands. The game just lacks much excitement.

Being a Robert E. Howard fan, Age of Conan is a huge surprise for me. The game captures the atmosphere of the short stories and novelettes by Howard fine. I like the wargame level in the game, and the adventures also bring life to the board. The Kingdom cards are astonishing with the comic graphics! The overall quality is what you can expect from FFG. This is an absolute must-have for a Conan-fan! 
Crom, count the dead!!! ;X 

Update on 23 January, 2013.
As far as I can judge, the balanced randomness of the game provides enough space for cunning and bloody strategies and it recquires permanent adaptation to the changing circumstances. There are turns in the game when diplomacy is dominant or when more military actions come forward.

Update on 24 November, 2013.
Age of Conan is still the best one in my collection. We keep playing the game and it's amazing.

Fun and Shogun-esque.  Looks great.  Can't catch all of the nuances during the first play, but it's a simple game.  The Adventure Track doesn't capture the Conan Saga in any real way though.  The Adventure Track reminds me of the Story Track in Marvel Heroes. Both Tracks are a cool idea, but neither accomplishes much.  
The theme in Conan is surprisingly spare compared to other games they produced.  But I'd totally play again.

July 2010 - Played again.  Two player this time.  Fun, but could benefit from a third or forth player.  Liked it again, and want to play more.

Quite a long game. I like playing, but think I'd prefer to play some of the eurogames rather than commit the time to play this one through (particularly with a larger group).

Also, having now played Command and Colors: Ancients I don't feel the need to play this to get a war game fix. The theme just isn't enough to make we want to play it often. 

I have also read a fair bit of criticism of this game. Now that I have a wider appreciation of the games out there, I think this is warranted, although I do like the game format. The comparisons I have read to the War of the Ring (as being a far superior game) have made me want to try that game instead.

Generally worth all the wait and all the hype. Excellently moulded plastic components with nice thick cardboard counters, clear well laid out rule book. 
Strategy and interraction captures the theme overall, though not in the same class as WOTR. Overall this is overpriced for what it is. 
If you think this is a wargame similar to WOTR, you will be disappointed so be warned. In my experience player vs player military conflict only occurs rarely and then not until late in the game. Conan himself is not particularly central to the game, and can feel a little like a "tacked on" feature, despite his adventures represented. The adventure cards are a little bland and don't set the atmosphere well, so you will need to be a Conan fan or use plenty of imagination. 
Can feel a little claustrophobic, as the board is again too small for the figures imo, though this is not as critical as it was in WOTR. Hopefully an expansion will give more space, more options, and more atmosphere.
Recommend you try before you buy, as this definately may not be the game you expected if you are an ardent WOTR-type fan (like me) and expected the same depth here. 
I was initially very enthusiastic, then a bit underwhelmed and left feeling "is that it?", but several more plays have increased my interest somewhat. A potential classic, but not there yet imo without an expansion.

Conan has unusually strong mechanic and fun to play. The way to do battle and intrigue, the fate dice pool, every kingdom has their own cards, all is good. Sadly, all of this soiled by the presence of Conan (it should be good, but in this game, it breaks this game). The player who controls Conan gets a huge advantage, and if there are some Conan+Court dice at pool, most of the time it will be picked first. It makes Conan control is too big part of the game, and making the kingdoms more less just like furniture. Good at 1st play, but will be bored about it soon.

For years, it seemed, I heard Sam Healey (former co-host of the Dice Tower) talk glowingly about Age of Conan.  However, I already had some "big" games that were hard to get played due to time and availability, so I didn't want to invest in another.  Well, along comes FFG's Holiday Sale, advertising this game for $20 and I couldn't pass it up.  Boy, am I glad I got it.  

From my initial playthrough solo, controlling just two armies, I fell in love with it.  There are multiple ways to victory, adventures, battles.... and the mechanics just seem to just feel right.  After my first 3p game, I can safely say this will be a favorite for a long time to come.

I think I enjoyed this game so much because I came to it fearing the worst after grim reviews here on BGG. I am a big fan of the novels. Just the tonic after too much dry reading at work. We played it to humour a friend who had bought it and we had an absolute blast. Yes, it does feel like it ends too soon & no, you can't be Conan. But just stop whining & enjoy a game that fits the Hyborian setting very nicely & where Conan is perfectly realised for a strategy game. He's a pain in the butt when he rampages through your territory, but when you get him to do what you want then he's a gift from the gods. Crom is strong in this one.

What we were hoping for was the war mechanics in War of the Ring without the hideously broken and boring get the Hobbits-to-Mordor-and-try-to-beat-the-clock-once-they-do part.

What we got was a standard conquest game, with some interesting elements, and Conan theme pasted on.  The Conan mechanics are the clunkiest thing about this game and it will take additional plays for me to decide if they work or not.  We only played part of a 2p game to learn the mechanics so far, and we do want to play again but are reserving judgment for now.

Rating after 1 play. The game is decent, not nearly as bad as I had expected after reading reviews from a few others.

The negative reviews I've read of this seem to suffer from the view that this is a four player version of [i]War of the Ring[/i]. These people envisioned large armies stomping across the board engaging in massive sieges. It isn't. There's combat, sure, but the game is probably closer to Wallenstein than War of the Ring.

Fundamentally, this is a game of area and resource management, with a Conan character running around the board causing headaches for just about everyone, a mechanic I found interesting. The custom strategy decks for each of the four players is a nice touch. The ability to hedge your bets in combat means most battlefield losses are probably the result of horrible luck or, more likely, bad planning on your part.

Yes, the defender does have an advantage (mostly because they can play cards while neutrals can't), but attacks against other players should be surgical strikes, not sweeping campaigns. It's just not what the game is meant to be.

With all that being said I rate this game a 6. It's not bad, but the wargamer in me just doesn't find it compelling. I'd play again if someone else was itching to play, but probably wouldn't suggest it myself.

This was fun enough to fill an evening and has plenty of "bits", but the map felt quite limiting as far as strategy and game play go (not many spaces = not much strategic choice). I also found the endgame unsatisfying as players wrangled for the right to control conan (players were balanced enough that it was always going to be the decider). Replay value I think will be quite low too.

A great looking game with intriguing if somewhat non-intuitive mechanics. Sort of like Risk mixed with Eurogame engine building and Game of Thrones intrigue. The Adventures cards really bring out the theme. Some critics say that Conan doesn't do much: they don't get the game if they think this. For one thing, there are 15 VPs tied up with Adventure tokens, most of which the Conan player gets. Second, using Conan as your general in campaigns, battles and sieges increases your odds of getting an extra hit by 17% for each die rolled.

I typically like FF games a great deal, but this one just didn't do it for me.  Conan has nothing to do with the game, and the game is uninteresting and unbalanced.

RATING: 5
I really like some of the mechanisms here, but it works out to less than the sum of its parts.  I know some complain that not playing as Conan is disappointing but I think its an ingenious use of the license to be kings warring over Hyboria and hoping to manipulate Conan just enough to aid your agenda over that of the enemy.

Drafting actions from a dice pool is a great mechanism.  It forces the players to adjust their strategies to what is available and lets them plan for opposing actions more effectively.

The setup is also interesting, putting the players very close together from the outset and threatening conflict right away.

Unfortunately, the process of conquering neutral kingdoms is dull and time consuming, the actions of the diplomats feel lackluster and don't influence the game enough, Conan rarely impacts the affairs of the players in spite of all the mechanisms that allow for it, and collecting Conan's adventure tokens isn't interesting.

These underwhelming parts of the game sap it of too much vitality and it dies on the table.  There are simply better dudes on a map games out there.

The game is too long for the amount of content it provides. I was very underwhelmed.

I think my biggest problem was, despite the clever mechanics, that there was very little tension in the game. It seemed to just sluggishly drag by with some occasional dice rolling to break the tedium. Only one person whom I played it with liked it at all, and he was the owner of the game.

RATING: 7
Players try to develop their Hyborian kingdom, earning the most empire points.  Interesting game, sharing many design features present in Nexus' own War of the Ring.  Players select a die from a pool to give them an action for their turn - military, political, etc.  Armies and emissaries move across the board, nudging provinces into their kingdoms, earning empire points and gold.  Military success awards "count the dead" points, for end of game bonuses.  Against all this, the figure of Conan moves around having adventures - he is the game clock, awards bonuses for the controlling player, and so on.  The Conan sub-game intersects the main game in various ways - granting combat bonuses if he's present; collecting adventure tokens for end game points or instant gold/sorcery; allowing a player to crown Conan to deny other players end game points.  There is a bit here, but the game plays very well, much simpler to get up and running compared to Nexus' other larger games, such as War of the Ring and Marvel Heroes.  The rulebook is excellent.  Plays in 2-3 hours - very good game.

To be fair, I only played this through once.  With that caveat, I found this game just had too many things going on.  I felt much the same way about Marvel Heroes, another game by the same group.  There's depth, and then there's just complexity, and this had much of the latter without necessarily bringing the former,  For example, there are at least 5 different kinds of combat, each with their own subrules.  

I bought Conan because War of the Ring (also by this group) is one of my favorite games.  WotR also has a lot of little rules, but it manages to hang together.  Conan just doesn't get there, and I'm not willing to play it enough to internalize the rules so that the strategy can come through.

"Crom, count the dead!"
This game brought back fond memories of the old pulp, large format magazine: The Savage Sword of Conan.
It was a nice touch to see some of the original coloured artwork from Conan the Barbarian & Savage Sword worked into the cards.
This is going to be one of those titles where subsequent plays will be much quicker than our 4+ hour learning game.
Still, I need to play this one again to get a solid feel for the rules.

Well, played it again & solid feel for the rules I had.  This time it was a four player game, with the fourth having never played.  Rules explanation took ½ hour (with questions), game took 4½ hours to complete.

It has dropped slightly in my rating (8 to 7.5).  Still, a great game!

Played my first game. It was OK. I wouldn't mind trying it a second time and getting a better feel of the game. We played only one era. It was a 3 player game and at the end of the era, only one player had armies of the era. Hardly anything we left standing.

We think there might be a loop hole in game. It is more a attackers game than a defenders game. Defender can't retreat, so it's like a battle for the death with no way out.  Each army lost is one less dice roll until you reach the number on the map.

Don't understand the hype about game. Kind of repetive on a first look. I need to play it again to see if it really is worth getting considering the price tag.

Can't put my finger on it, but something about the game rules just doesn't work. Not sure how much this game was play tested. Maybe we played it wrong or I couldn't see all the possibilities.

If you're a fan of the worlds of Conan is very exciting and fun to play this game. If you're not, at least you will have fun rather than playing Risk as this has more rules that make it more complex and diversified even more. If you like strategy games, this is not your game. It could improve the board size, too small for my taste, and the target cards are unbalanced about their punctuation. That sounds great given the target system, and the combination of the bookmark and history harness Conan movement give good pop that makes this game more than just a Risk.

RATING: 4
It's an interesting game of asymmetrical nations battling neutral forces and enemy player forces.  This can be done through military or political means.  The game feels as it's played in two phases even though there are 3 actual phases.  Phase 1 which is a land grab/build up period where there is little player interaction.  Phase 2 is when things heat up and player's attack one another.  The dice mechanism of War of the Ring is interesting and I like that it can play from 2 - 4, but WotR is the better game overall.

Extremely complicated and difficult to learn because there are so many things to keep track of.  Set up is quick and easy, however.  Rules are well designed and components are top-notch.  I get the sense that once I've played it enough to understand how everything fits together I will enjoy it more.  Right now it plays too long, but that is partly because of long decision deliberations.  I appreciate the complexity and the multiple paths to victory, which are things I like in games.  After more plays I may rate this higher...

The problem is, I can never get it to the table.

If this is not pasted-on theme, I don't know what is. Absolutely no Conan-flavour at all. It's your basic "roll dice and conquer" game but the whole thing seems forced and the game is too damnably long, especially as nothing much happens in between.

Conan marca la diferencia, y es mejor tenerlo de aliado que de enemigo. Ese será el objetivo de nuestro ejército: tenerlo de nuestro lado y, si es posible, coronarlo..

Disappointing.  A long game (that's good) where not much happens (that's bad).  Conan wanders around the map dumbly while every Euro mechanic in the book is tossed into the stewpot.  Sadly, the boardstate remains the same, always the same.  Hard rules to internalize and took about six hours to play, partially for that reason.  Still, it's a big crazy pile of components, so I would be willing to give it another shot and see if more is there.

Had a lot of things going on (typical for a FFG game). I fear this has the typical FFG-syndrome of "fun the first time, but the fun factor wears off really fast" that so many of their other monster boxes exhibit. I wouldn't be against playing it again, but I don't think this will be coming into my collection soon, even with the cheap prices seen everywhere lately.

Update on second play: Indeed there are a lot of things going on, and none of them fleshed out properly. It would probably be a much better game had it gone a few more months of hard core playtesting. Rating of six stands.

Once you have the rules down this is a relatively quick playing game for a conquest themed game, but teaching a new player how to play the game takes almost as long as playing it, and there are few shortcuts as players need to know around 90% of the rules before they even take the first turn. 

A good choice if you mostly play with the same group of guys, but if you play a lot of pick up games then not so good.

My rating assumes that I'd be playing with a group that already knows the rules, otherwise I'm much less likely to want to play.

Interesting lighter and faster twist on the War of the Ring by the same designers.  Conan as an "influenced extra player" is well done and offers extra tension, even in a 2 player game.  Conan theme and artwork are excellent for those familiar with it.  Surprised that this game is not rated higher.

RATING: N/A
Solid and strategic game. At first, the rules do appear to be very complex and just ... just ... a barrier to completing your turn. However, after a couple rounds the rules are starting to make sense, and game play proceeds much more smoothly.

Overall a great game, but I have severe problems with how Conan himself works. He is more of a random boon and nuance than a thematic enhancement. But, nothing a few house rules can't fix!

This is really a little gem that has many, many elements blended into an expreience that is rich in theme, gives the players a considerable variety of good options and - due to the fact that dice determine which options will be available to the players in the next few turns - avoids the trap of being an entirely tactical brainburner. 

I have upgraded my rating after being once again surprised at the way the facets of the game develop within a play. Involving, thematic with really neat mechanics.

Only one play, but an interesting 'action drafting' mechanism.  It was a long game though, but it seems to be one of those games where the first couple games take a lot longer then they should.

Jugado en el MdM

De los autores de La Guerra del Anillo y con bastantes caracteristicas similares a aquel, llega este juego de estrategia en Hyborea. 

Es un juego ciertamente complejo, grande, que incluye estrategia militar y diplomatica, ciertamente "lioso" (como el GdA) y en el que Conan es un PnJ que "está por allí" y puede ser "reclutado" por los jugadores como ayuda, pero no directamente manejado por alguno de ellos. 

De la partida de prueba solo pude sacar dos conclusiones: que es complejo y que en una partida con Richard es conveniente tener a mano nolotil. :-p 

En general pinta un buen juego pero... complicado. No fueron las circunstancias mas idoneas para una partida introductoria.

Para jugar otra partida. (una completa)

Making such a dull game out of such a good theme is a crime against fantasy literature. Maybe the theme actually loaded too much expectations to the game, but seeing as how the War of the Ring and Middle-Earth Quest have delivered their promises, this one sadly doesn't. If I have a free evening and 2-4 friends willing to invest in a long, theme-rich game, this is not the game I will be choosing, ever.

Preliminary rating - only played once.  Odd game that combines some euro mechanics with risk like gameplay and manages a little of the flavor of the stories, but not much.  Conan basically does his Forrest Gump impression, walking across the country and maybe having a couple adventures along the way.

Finally played the 4-player version. I liked it - I felt like in my best Warhammer days with dice-rolling galore.
Although I have to admit the game got a bit tedious in the end. But then we had 2 newbies and all the possibilities overwhelmed them a bit.
Played 4-player again: still like it a lot, but found it could have more interaction. Only 3 PvP-conflicts in the whole game. Maybe we just have to play more aggressive.

RATING: 2
This could have been ANY strategy game, Conan and his world were all pasted on, the spaces on the map and the cards could have had any titles and it would still be a generic strategy game. The fate dice mechanic is pretty good but it doesn't reflect the action in REHs works. Conan's exploits being reduced to resource acquisition and endgame points for a completely unrelated kingdom was the biggest letdown. The game should have leaned more towards being a character-based game where Conan is knee-deep in gore or a more of an in-depth conquest game. This is a vanilla strategy game with nice pieces. A let down for me.

RATING: 8
This is a very euro-y war game with some civ-building aspects.  There is a lot of strategy to be made with hand management and making the right decisions based on the current situation of the board and your hand.  

I like this game a lot though it feels slow and think-y. 

It can fill the civ itch while also filling the euro and war game itch.  Very intelligent design.  

You really need to pay attention to other players.

The biggest flaw is that there are so many rules compared to what there is it do.  I don't mind the simplicity of the actions, but the fact that I have to spend a day learning the rules is annoying.

So many different strategies to take, it takes multiple plays to even start to tap into them. Those disappointed in not playing Conan miss the point of Conan. He is represented well in the game, just like the stories: he's a wild card, unattainable, and a potential threat or ally. Really great game but you have to give it a chance. You also have to be ready to give 3-5 hours of your time for a 3 or 4 player game. I've played about 10 times, and in that time, I've had 8 different players, almost all who give it a positive score on fun. Only 2 were "lukewarm" and neither of the two were big board game players.

Brilliant strategy, though the rules could use a tweak or two.

We didn't play this game correctly the first time, as the rulebook is the most convoluted crap I've ever had to read through.  It took us over an hour to struggle to just get the basics underway, then we would have to frequently reference the book again.  Then we realized we should have just learned from the Reference sheets, as they are more concise and orderly.  (Disregard the fact that there are a few discrepancies between the book and the reference sheets!)

Despite all of that, it still wasn't very fun.  A slow moving dice-fest.  Not only are the actions all dice-based, but so is the combat.  The intrigue/military is an interesting idea, but really doesn't give enough depth to the game.  That and I'm just not interested in the Conan theme.  You win women because Conan is a hot stud barbarian?  Gag me.

An interesting Wargame with some mechanics I really love. I wish Conan himself had more of a role though - it seems like he is an afterthought, affecting battles in territotires he has randomly wandered to and serving as an alternate victory condition.

Love the theme & the components are great!  Winning majorities in adventure tokens is really important, even more so if you can crown Conan (or"cown Cronan" as it's become known).

I took me a while to fully understand the rules & various phases of gameplay but I like games that require some work.  Play time seems to be about 1 hour per player.

I think this is pretty good with 2, 3 or 4 players.  The gameplay is better with less players but it's a shame to not use the whole board & all the powers ... so I'm happy to play either way.

Notes to self: you can 'siege' opponent's towers as well as use intrigue (but only if there are no enemy army units there for intrigue contests); 'control' means having a control marker (i.e. any building) in the province (but the player aid is wrong about final scoring - towers do not give VP).

I love the conquest mechanics. The fact that you need to prepare for every step of the conquest. In addition, the combination of military actions and the Conan mechanic. The only negative aspect of the game is the fact that every player needs to take care of what other player is doing, I mean, if Turan is not aware and puts pressure on what Stigia is doing, probably, Stigia will win, if Hyperborea doesn't push Aquilonia, the same will happen.
But aside from that, I really love the game and really enjoy playing it. To me is a bit surprising that it is so low in the ranking. In addition, another issue is how valuable is to attack other players. Many times it is not strategically useful to engage in battles instead of conquering provinces.

It took several plays to get it down but this game is another WINNER from the Italian Stallions game group (Nexus/FF). They came up with the PERFECT way of handling Conan as no one plays him but all the players bid for his help. This totally fits his idium. Ingenious system for an amazingly fun game. Much of this game is comparable to WoTR and I would call them sister games. I pimped the game out painting the minis and then making picture counters of them for ease of board space.

After years of playing ELRIC: The Board Game, AoC has some of the same feel as that game.  But as far as Conquests of Hyborian Provinces go, the game is on a completely different level.  Seiges & Battles don't determine who owns a Province--Conquests do.  So after finishing one form of military conflict, another follows to determine if your Kingdom manages to expand it's boarders.  This is a great game & the presence of Conan in military conflicts really adds to the excitement.  It's Fate Dice mechanic is also another excellent addition to the game.  Add this to Kingdom & Strategy cards & you have a very well thought out game which satisfies anyone who likes conquest strategy games.  & if you are a fan of Conan pulp fiction then this game is for you.

I think this is a good 3 hour game...unfortunately my first game took us 4 1/2 hours.  Still, I enjoyed it, despite not doing great.  Some terrible die rolling killed me, and with "normal" die rolling, I think this could be a fun, competitive game.  I like the different personalities of the 4 nations, and the choices in actions and quests and the like.

RATING: 6
I'll give it a 6--which is better than the 3 I gave it the first time around--with upward mobility possible if the expansion is as good as it looks and if playtime in general can be brought down some. It's still kind of a PITA to teach because of the numerous similar-but-not-identical mechanics, and it still feels like you're spending a lot of time fighting neutrals and avoiding each other, but it's at least OK.

This is a quite fun game that would rate even higher, except I'm uncertain how many repeat plays it would take to feel played out.
The game has a lot of types of cards and actions, which can seem a high amount to grasp at first.  But you quickly realize it's not, and as understanding increases, things go more quickly.  The mechanic of choosing from the steadily shrinking choices each dice pool "round" makes it more interesting, and gets everyone to step outside the usual and try the other parts of the game.

I like the odd blend of "wargame" and resource management.  Resources include, dice, cards, sorcery, certain player pieces and gold.

Right now, it feels like an 8.

Some similar features with the "War of the Ring". The most recognizible feature that is used in both of these games, is the action-dice pool. Being the "Conan-player" seems like a nice addition to the game, as the title is awarded to the last player between the "Ages". Fast gameplay combined with a great theme. After a few games I'll most propably raise the rating of this game to a solid 9. At least I hope that will be the case then...

This is the modern replacement for the Risk style of war games. Plenty of theme and easy bit combat. It's light enough for younger players to understand and has a lot of elements and diversity to keep gamers happy. I like the use of the comic artwork splattered about, but it made me yearn for a little more of it. Oh, and the learning curve is huge! Keep that in mind when first learning or teaching the game. That's about the only criticism I have.

Actually my wish is ... it had been a 'battles of the War of the Ring' type of game set in Conans' world. 
Varied troop units_ catapults, siege towers, cav. eletes, etc. Mix in Conan and that would of been fun!
 And FFG ... put out a organized rule book.. if your going to change the original RB !!!! 

Must be played several times to grasp tactics 
and appreciate the depth that's possible.

Nice components and theme gives you some of the flavor of Robert E. Howard's epic world. This is really a resource management game where you are trying to expand your kingdom to satisfy one or all of the objectives for each of the three ages of the world in order to score the most Victory points. There are many ways to acquire points but there is a limited number of adventures thus turns/actions you can perform. Building armies, attacking, using diplomacy to acquire adjacent territories, and helping/using/coercing Conan for your own purposes (this occurs through a bidding process amongst the players and actions to move Conan). It is a solid game of this type although you probably would enjoy it more if you like the worlds of Robert E. Howard for there is always a way, if the desire be coupled with courage.

After a few plays, it became pretty obvious that the map board has a greater impact on the game than anything the players might to. If Yellow does not go after Green, who will? Then it's Red against Purple. I liked the mechanics of Conan: the card play, the dice, the pieces. Ultimately it became too easy for the Green faction to turtle. Traded.

Been impressed with this Conan game since the first play, and it has gotten better. I guess one could consider this a Risk variant in that you have plastic armies, roll dice, and try to take over the world. Conan adds some tasty extra layers, though. The decks of Kingdom cards ensures that each faction, and every play of the game, is different. The control of Conan, himself, adds a super-fun layer of genre flavor. Usually not that interested in games with this much luck, but this one is a go! A small detail is the hit dice give an extra pip to the attacker. This attacker advantage gives the game a real sense of cut-and-thrust. Rating may go up.

Too much. Too much stuff going on in this one. Give me A Game of Thrones boardgame anyday of the week over this one. The game pins you down and overwhelms you with how all the parts of the game interlock. Where AGoT gives you room to move about and explore the game tactically, AoC culls you into a little pen and keeps you locked up there for the whole game. Not my cup of tea thank you.

Age of Conan is such an odd game.  We tried to like.  Why is the red area so much bigger than everyone else's area.  You can't do anything without going through the red.  Everyone else is squished off to the side.

And the goals are so random.  Some players are close to having them as soon as they come up.  Others are impossible.

And then Conan is doing his own thing.  Sure he can fight for you if the just happens to be in the right spot.  I'd rather hire him like the ninja in Samurai swords.

The terrain track is a cool idea.  But we just could get this game to work.  We tried some house rules but we just could work it out.

'[b]Conan - The Gay Blade[/b]'. It's a cultural thing, really. My wife wants to know who his hairdresser is.

Luckily the interior bits have completely different artwork; something other than the Beautiful Gigilo He-Man fellow. As someone who has read Riverworld, with the swooning gay-friendly Robert E. Howard caricature, I have to say, "I Get It". It makes it difficult to take this game seriously, especially since I am a Conan fan, and he was no swisher. I could never buy this game unless it was a good deal (update: got a fairly good deal).

These guys make great games, I'm sure this will be no exception.

As long as we can bring this one down in play time, I'm certain I can continue to have the love affair I enjoy with it. I can certainly say that it didn't feel 3.5 hours long, and it was totally engaging. There are some possibilities for AP issues, as well as "dud" turns where there are no dice that are worthwhile for you to use, in a way; though this is exceptionally rare and minor.

I love that like Cleopatra, there is a total loss condition in the game. I also like that you have the option for playing against the game and/or the other players. I wish the objectives had slightly higher values to make non combat options more viable, but I supposed since it's a Conan game, it makes sense for it to be about fighting.

RATING: 6
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women!

Well, after a First Game, I'm unimpressed. There's a lot of small rules hidden away in the not very well written rulebook, and the game itself seems quite complex for what it's worth. I'm hoping that a second game with the same crowd will allow us to have a more streamlined game, a quicker one, with more actual knowledge of what you're doing. Problem is, two out of the four players from that initial game decided they don't want to play the game ever again. Bugger.

I'm hoping the game is not going to suck, because I've been quite hyped about it and I got it for Secret Santa...

After a second game it seems my initial thoughts were accurate, unfortunately. Amazing production value all around, but the game has way to many half-baked (or even half-working) mechanisms to be considered good... I'm giving it a few more chances if I find the people to play it, but I'm afraid it'll end up being a source for prototype components and RPG battle-grid figures...

01.12.12 - third game in, tried to fix it with a simple house rule which seemed to help, but it made the session drag mercilessly (after two hours we were only around half-way through the first Age)... I'm afraid I won't be able to save this game from gathering dust on the shelve :(

09.04.17 - This game broke my heart about as much as it is broken itself. That's a fair amount. Barely enjoyable, despite the great production values and awesome theme.

Sold it off :(

A throwback to the dark 1980s of game design - fiddly rules, combat with lots of modifiers that nevertheless manages to feel very bland, and not a lot of real decisions over a lot of playing time. It's biggest failure for me is that the tactical micro-decisions are very involved and thinky, while the really decisive stuff is mainly down to luck of the draw.

Overall, it's not actively bad, but it has to compete in a niche (3+ hours dudes on a map) where a lot of infinitely better games reside, so I can safely say that I'll happily never play this again. Horrible rules, by the way - if you're at all interested in this, try to learn it from somebody who's already played it.

Better than most people seem to think. Great mechanics and thematic design which come together in a feeling of heavy and slow feats of conquest and empire building crossed by the flexible and unexpected moves/switches of Conan (especially with the expansion - which is amazing). Yet, maybe a bit to long? We'll see...

Rated after one play. I enjoyed the game and can see myself liking it better. The 2 player game is good, but I think this game will be really better with more.

Will probably go up

Strategic and intense. I like that there is some difference between the factions and that the Conan adventure metagame stirs things up. There is also no practical player eliminiation and because of the ages you always have to plan long term.

Also I won't play without making the VPs for conquering an area losable if you lose the area.

This is a great game. My girlfriend and I have played it together several times and we find it more and more interesting with each play. It is so much fun that we have actually had some disputes over the game, which I think simply goes to show how much we both get into the game while playing.

I actually usually lose when we play this game because my mentality is more suited to a straightforward wargame setting where you just build up your armies then go smash your enemies into the dust. This tactic never seems to work though because although I manage to conquer more provinces than my girlfriend (my usual gaming buddy) she always gets ahead on the other stuff and wins by a couple of victory points. Really frustrating but strangely I really enjoy playing the game, even when I lose at the end.

Really fun area control game. Each of the four factions has a specific feel to them with unique cards (though there is some overlap in the effects), and positioning is key to what you're looking to do, as the Strategy cards only give bonuses in the region types noted on them.
Combat and action selection are both based on dicerolls, making randomness a heavy factor in the gameplay, though there are ways of mitigating this.

RATING: 4
2 / 5 - Fair.

Although well rounded and interesting in terms of mechanics and theme, the game play too often falls flat, especially in the early part of the game. There's too much time conquering neutral territories at the start, the large attacker advantage removes much of the tension from combat and there's basically not much point in keeping tabs on the game when it's not your turn. Which is a shame because in other respects this is a clever, well-balanced game which will tax many different gaming skills. See my review for more details:

Seemingly complicated at first, I was able to catch on rather quickly.  I've never really thought I'd been interested in wargames, but Conan was evidently a great segue-way into the genre as I really enjoyed myself.  (I'm sure it helped that I ended up winning.)   As for the game itself, there are LOTS of things to keep track of and remember, so the handy reference cards were essential.  The "timer" for the game is a series of adventures Conan pursues.  In this particular playing of the game, this seemed to be more of a side-quest that was rarely accomplished.  Overall, I enjoyed the game and would definitely play it again, but a good chunk of time is definitely necessary.

I really have to stop buying Fantasy Flight games because I like the theme.  I didn't like War of the Ring.  I didn't like Twilight Imperium or Arkham Horror.  So what did I do?  I bought this anyway because the theme was cool and the playtime was relatively short.

When will I learn?

RATING: 3
In addition to being surprisingly dull game for a "Conan" game, it is also unfair/unbalanced, it also drags even it really should not and to underline it all: It just does not reward!

I had high aspiration, but the game never fulfilled them.
I guess the game requires the players to have a fair bit of knowledge in the conan-world.
For people like me, who lack that knowledge and enthusiasm, there simply are better 4-player military games, as this one is fairly awkward.

RATING: 5
Too long for what it is, with what appears to be a huge advantage to the player who avoids conflict. I doubt that you could win by turtling, but if you maintain a good defensive position and just grab a couple territories, I suspect you can win nearly every time. And if everybody does this, the game will be amazingly boring. Not as boring as an actual, average Euro, mind you. But still boring.

Great theme, lovely components and a couple of innovative mechanics (like the dice pool) don't necessarily add up to a great game. The Conan adventure doesn't really add much, although it seems like a great idea at first.

If four players could finish in an hour and a half, it might be worth it. But I'm not convinced that's possible.

It really tweaks me to have to give this a 5, because I [i]so[/i] wanted to like it. I can't recommend paying full retail for this. I could get $15 worth of game play from this, but not $50 or whatever it's going for now.

I liked this game better than my groups did (it's essentially War of the Rings that plays 3) but that wasn't enough to save it. Conan's world is tricky to get right, and this game never quite felt cohesive enough to have its own identity, much less the "correct" identity for a Conan fan like me. I did like the crowning-as-win-condition, though. None of these hesitations stopped me from backing the new edition on Kickstarter, however.

RATING: 5
I consider this one a bad marriage of Warrior Knights and War of the Ring, absent any meaningful player interaction, and with a couple of solid run-away leader strategies that can ruin it for new players who aren't familiar with how to shut them down. Add excessively long playing time (for what it offers) and needlessly fiddly thematic chrome and you've got a dud.

Really not a bad game at all, except it isn't Conan.  Not even slightly.  It's a difficult topic, to be sure, but still: what has happened to the Golden Italian Trio?  Marvel Heroes and now this??  After the innovative and thematic War of the Ring?  If I want to play a lightly-themed Euro, there are better games to choose from.

Really enjoy this game. Like the combat system that requires you to take over territories in stages. Conan is implemented well. The game has a nice blend of strategy and push your luck. The board and pieces are some of the highest quality I've seen in this type of game.

Одна из тех игр, у которых правила никак не могут уложиться в голове, и я неоднократно залезаю в правила, чтобы что-нибудь уточнить. Сама игра: ну, красивая, ну стратегия. Интересная, но не могу сказать, что чем то выдающаяся игра. После звёздной тройки Старкрафт, Игра престолов и Nexus Ops - меня трудно чем удивить. К сожалению, здесь мало поощрается военный конфликт с другими игроками. Зато очки можно получать много за что, поэтому гонка выходит знатная!
P.S. Да здесь вообще 80% взаимодействия — чисто конкурентное. Очень странно, что в такой с виду стратегической (!) игре прямого конфликта — всего 20%. Садиться за такое в очередной раз не хочется.

I have only played it once, but had fun. Need to play it some more to get the hang of all the rules. They can be a little confusing, but once you start playing, they seem to come together just fine. The struggle was to remember all the rules during every action. If you like light hearted war games with some card and dice action, then give it a try.

Rating based on one four-player game which took 4 hours to complete. I thought I had victory in the bag, but I learned that I need to pay better attention to the endgame scoring.

RATING: N/A
In this 2-4 player game, players play one of the four major kingdoms, who each have their own Kingdom deck of cards. Game lasts three ages. In addition there is a general strategy deck of cards to draw from as well. Each kingdom has two kinds of units, soldiers and emissaries. The start player rolls 7 dice, and chooses one of them for an action. The next player chooses a dice, and so forth. When the dice are out, the current player re-rolls the 7 dice. The actions are: 1) move Conan, and get an adventure token, 2) move armies and attack, or recruit armies 3) intrigue, 4) draw cards.

Neutral regions have a VP value from 2 to 4. Taking over a neutral region requires a number of successful attack rounds, and attacks are conducted by combat dice. Each army you attack with gives you an attack dice (chance to hit is 1 in 6), and if you can outhit the defender, you win the round. Once a neutral country has been militarily defeated, you put on a fort and you earn the VPs of the province. 

Using an intrigue action dice, you may attempt to control a neutral province. The more the neutral province is adjacent to provinces you already own, or adjacent emissaries, the more dice you get to roll for the attempt. An intrigue action dice also allows you to move two emissaries, or bring one onto the board. 

In each age, there are four adventures for Conan. At the start of each adventure, players bid to control Conan. Players have bid counters 0, 3, 4, 5, 6. The '3' token can be re-used, and the '0' token brings back all previously used tokens, but not itself. Players add their bid token to a value on a strategy card (value from 1 to 6) and blind bid for Conan. Players who control Conan can move the Conan figure, generally closer to the objective on the adventure card to earn a bonus adventure token. When players move Conan, they get an adventure token. These adventure tokens are used to earn bonus cards during the game. 

In each age, there are bonus points for objectives that are attained (e.g., person to control two nonadjacent coastal provinces earns 2 VPs). At the end of the game, a final scoring counting gold (3 VPs) and adventure tokens (3 VPs in each of the four suits) occurs. A person also has a choice to "crown" Conan to earn a bonus 3 VPs, but if they fail, they lose the game.

The game does last 3-4 hrs, and we only played a partial game. It does look like a good game, and I want to get a few more plays in.

RATING: 7.5
Age of Conan is a game I've been thinking about since I first saw it on sale at FF's holiday sale and passed up the opportunity. There are a lot of reasons I'm thinking about getting it but other reasons I'm doubting it. Perhaps someone will be able to help me.

Perceived pros: 
-Designed by makers of War of the Ring--favorite board game ever. I like their action dice mechanic and understand that they did something similar but different enough in this game.
-Great components, attractive board, nice miniatures, 
-like what I hear about mechanics, especially Conan mechanic
-Like Conan and theme pretty well
-Supposed to be shorter and lighter than War of the Ring with more streamlined rules having less exceptions and special cases
-Allows truly for 2-4 players whereas WOTR is a 2 player game with a 4 player variant tact on.

Perceived Cons:
-Might be too similar in many regards to War of the Ring. When I have board games that are too similar I usually end up just playing the one I like more rather than switching and this makes one of them obsolete mostly.
-I hear it's not actually as short as advertised and can easily take 3 hours which means it doesn't fit into the WOTR--BUT shorter niche I was hoping for quite as well
-I hear the game requires a certain personality to play and is only interesting if people remain aggressive from early on and can have a little bit of a lack of interaction and too much turtling or soloing otherwise, especially in early game. I hear the expansion will address this though and make it even better.
-The game mechanics ultimately tally up who won by who scored better at the end of the ages--this is more like Risk Godstorm than WOTR which could be fine but doesn't, it seems to me, allow for quite the epic final conclusive climax that WOTR pulls off so well.

----------------------
Update: I've bumped it from thinking about it to must have--after a bunch of research I think it will be different enough and have it's own niche compared to WOTR. I like a lot of what I'm hearing and think that it will be worthwhile.
------------------------------
Update:
Purchased the game and played it. I'm surprised. I was expecting something much worse than War of the Ring that only vaguely felt like it. Well, the game is certainly different in feel in most ways than WOTR, but I feel that it's definitey underrated. War of the Ring is still significantly better, but the way people have characterized this as being a dud compared to WOTR's success is utterly false. This game is fun, has a number of elements unique to it, makes for fast-paced conquest game play, introduces clever and satisfying mechanics never seen before in a conquest game and works really well to make the gameplay FEEL like you're conquering in the world of Conan.

If anyone tells you that War of the Ring is good but this one is not worth it, they are lying. This game is not quite as good but it's still really great and most importantly different enough from War of the Rring that it's absolutely worth it. I love this game and look forward to playing it again and again. It has a lot of features that make you think, "why wasn't this used in every other conquest game?"

It also plays with 4 players much more smoothly than WOTR which is at it's heart a two-player game which CAN be made to play with 4 players.

Update: Despite a few shortcomings this game has truly stood the test of time as our single biggest staple in the genre of conquest games and considering the competition within that over saturated genre, I couldn't give this game a bigger compliment.

-----Preliminary Thoughts-----

THE GOOD
-> Nice implementation of theme.
-> Very good components. 
-> Can be found at a great price at 27€ in Spanish.
-> Nice strategic value.

THE BAD
-> Rules are very complex. It seems to be the kind of games that, if you don't play it regularly, you spend half of the gaming season looking through the rules book.
-> Nothing too exciting to justify the complexity of the rules.
-> Not as short as advertised.

I love that it uses a great mechanic from War of the Rings and makes it available in an easier to learn game that plays better with 3 or 4 players than WotR does. It's a fun game, but it does tend to drag a bit toward the end and by the time I finish a game I'm ready to shelf it for a couple of months.

RATING: 4
What I liked:
- Our (probably unusual game) had little pvp conflict
- Very good components

What I didn't like:
- Our game would have taken SEVEN HOURS if played to its end. We aborted after 1.5 ages and 3.5 hours
- In a full normal game, it would have more conflict than I like

I'll start by saying that I don't like games with overt conflict. I like that in this one you battle to win neutral territories, and that attacking other players comes at a steep cost. However, being a battle for VP's on a map that probably gets crowded near the end, it's going to be full of conflict.

But for a game of this style, the gameplay wasn't bad. What was bad was the length. I played a 3p game with one other newbie. After 30 minutes of rules, it took us just over 2 hours to finish the first age. We decide to play just half an age more, so we stopped the game after 3.5 hours, having played half as many adventures as a full game would include. That means the full game would have taken SEVEN HOURs. For me, that's at least 5 hours too many.

I would say the weight is about 3.0.

Sure you don't get to actually be Conan, but the game is still fun.  Play as one of the main empires from the Hyborian world and see if you can conquer it.
May not be the most hardcore strategy game available but still provides plenty of options for the players.
Plays best with four, but I have played with two and even solo.  Sure there's no diplomacy when playing solo but is still suprisingly fun.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: There is a lot of randomness, since you have to rely a lot on the cards you get and the dice. I like the fact that the attacker generally has an advantage since it fits with the theme. Also, the Conan feature is cool but turns are short thus often just a race to get him to his location. Overall, it was mildly fun, but there are many better games in the genre. Some of the objectives also favor certain players and not all the kingdoms are equal, which is not necessarily bad, but can be annoying.

I really tried to like this game. But I found it rather frustrating experience both times I played. It takes a lot of work to gain territories and they are so easy to loose, no matter how hard you try to defend them. I got the feeling that the advantage goes to the attacker. I'm still keeping it just in case I discover a new love for it next time I play...

The fact that Conan is so uncontrollable fits well into the game narrative and seems to come straight off the pages of Howard's original stories perfectly. Players genuinely fear Conan as he approaches their lands.  The designers and artists have truly created this game from the heart and understood the world they were trying to replicate onto the tabletop. Highly recommended if you can find a copy and I'm excited to hear that there is an expansion.

After second play, I can say that this game is actually good, although it seems that doing mostly intrigues in the first age is a must - then the game just works better: less neutral provinces left in midgame, more money in player hands = more military units/more kingdom cards, more battles between players -> more tension and excitement.

Nice game but not great. Will play again though. War of the Ring by the same designers is more tense. Compared to that game this is the children of Catan variant.

After a second game I saw the light which resulted in a increase with 2 points an 8 and maybe even more after more plays. This is not playable in 90 minutes I think.

RATING: 8
I did not give much credit for this game when I first played it, but left the table intrigued and with the feeling it had a lot more to deliver.

Sure the crowning Conan mechanic is a downer as it can definitely break the game. But with a minor adjustment (we play that majorities on tokens are scored by every player) this game becomes a little gem.

The game beginning is slow paced, but it simulates in a very interesting way the expansion of the kingdoms. Fighting the provinces for domination forces you to make important decisions and to balance when to push your luck and try to score those points as sooner as possible.

When the expansionism is over, it is time to decide who’s a threat and, thus, where the next attacks will have to take place. Do not get diverged by the battles against the board. After that, the game becomes very confrontational.
Combat being enhanced with the cards grants an intriguing balance between tactics and strategy.

In spite of Conan not being the central character of this game and just a mere coadjutant, Age of Conan provides an immersive playing experience sewing up lots of different mechanics.

Yes maybe it takes 1 hour longer than it should, but I don’t care. Fate dice add unexpected twists on play and one have to be very clever as to managing to see that no always the obvious choice is the best. Also, competing for tokens majority obliges players to pay close attention to other players’ turns, which is a nice artifice to try and keep balance of the game without the need of some serious ganging up.

All in all, with the abovementioned house rule, the somewhat mediocre crude stone becomes a well-polished gem. All matches I have played were extremely tight and at least 3 of the players had clear conditions to winning.

If you have the opportunity, grab this one. You won’t regret.

A great combination of Euro style thinking and planning with some random elements Ameritrash style. I need another few plays to see if it is executed flawlessly or if there are some short comings.

4/5/2009 - Got in 2 more plays and the game has not been well received in my group. Most people thought it was ok, but no one was very excited about it. I have the same feelings. The game doesn't seem to have much "soul". Everything I do seems sort of mechanical without enough player interaction or theme driving my actions. I really wanted to like this one, but I think it might go on the trade pile due to my groups lack of enthusiasm for it.

In order for me to get interested about an expand and conquer game, it has to have innovative mechanisms and a captivating theme, both of which are lacking in Age of Conan.

The supposedly innovative feature about this one is the Conan figure. Players auction for the right to use this figure, who gives some bonuses. The player controlling Conan must move it to a specific territory in a limited amount of moves to obtain another bonus.

However, Conan plays a relatively small part in this game; players represent factions that try to take over as much territory as possible, building forts, cities, and towers along the way. So the supposed crux of the game, Conan, is simply another generic mechanic, of which this game has many.

Other mechanics include: dice that are rolled which dictate which actions players may perform, multi-use strategy cards that give bonuses to battles (there are two types of them) and used to auction for Conan. separate decks of cards for each faction that contain other special powers, and public objective cards that serve as tie-breakers.

Playing this game gave me the feeling that the designer quickly picked as many generic mechanisms as possible and crammed it into one game, rather than thinking of the theme of the game, then developing mechanisms to flesh the theme out.

RATING: 4
This game is a steaming turd - decades old design, with embarrassingly-unbalanced game design.
If you're going to make a new variant version of Risk with a Conan theme, I'd suggest that the designers not take away the player's tactical decisions by overwhelming the gameplay with too-variable of mechanics.
The 2-player game is decided by whoever receives the artifact that assists with Emissaries in the 1st Age- it's as simple as that. Gold is better than military victories to start with. I saw no reason why Artifacts should be dealt out in the 1st age - people should have to work for them, and have some control over which they get (by working to be the strongest in that poarticular treasure category throughout the 1st age).
Also, who thought it would be a good idea to screw up the bidding mechanic with the overwhelmingly-random strategy card inclusion?  If you get dealt 1's and 2's, it completely obliterates most strategic decisions in the critical Conan bidding aspect in the game. Whoever came up with that idiotic idea should turn in their boardgame designing badge for life.
Actually, the more I read and think about this cluster-f&^% of a game, the shittier I think it is. It's so bad, it may have finally convinced me I may not be a Ameritrasher (after sitting through interminable sessions of Tomb, A Touch of Evil, Battlestar Galactica, and this), if this is the kind of drek that characterizes the contemporary AT movement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is my AT guilty treat, and the more I play it the more I enjoy it - over in three hours, nice abstract and euro elements (bidding for Conan, collecting adventure tokens/sets), empire building without resources (which gives me headaches) and avoids over reliance on Risk-like combat between players.


Not the most strategic game I've played - the fate dice ensures a lot of tactical decisions. But there's enough to think about and do (I still don't make full use of the Kingdom Cards) to bring decent repeat play to the table. Can understand why a lot don't like it, as some of the mechanics appear tacked on and a bit screwy, but it really works for me.

RATING: 7
Top notch bits and a great theme. Lead Stygia, Aquilonia, Hyrkania, or Hyperboria as Conan carries out exploits across the map. Like a lot of FFG offerings, there are many moving parts that leave room for error. That said, once you play a few turns, everything comes together for an immersive gaming experience.

In some ways, a shorter, lighter, multiplayer version of War of the Ring - which is a good thing. It has theme, but with minor modifications maybe it could have more. Excellent production quality, balanced powers, no setup time, little room for backstabbing or diplomatic quibbles, dinamic. It is a fast wargame with a good selection of euromechanics threw in. A 4-player game usually ends under 3 hours and it scales well for 3 or even 2-player games. Many people will hold this game down in comparision to War of the Ring, but with the possibility of playing it twice with double the players in the same amount of time, I think I'll stick with this one most of the time.

Just didn't do it for me.  Took too long.  Game about Conan should involve the players interacting with Conan more, he felt almost like an afterthought and at most was just a timekeeper for the game length.  Fighting mechanics are so so... Basically the only solid way to win is to scoop up Adventure tokens as fast as possible.  Production was great.

Risk-like, themed war game with action selection (via dice), action cards, and troop/emissary movement for military/poltical campaigns to conquer territories via force or partnership.

Had a good read of the rules and does have similar mechanics as War of the Ring but also has many differences to make it unique. I was worried that it may be to similar to WotR but not so, either way I will pick this up. I am a huge fan of the designers and FFG products. 
Had our first game with 3 of us and went quite well. One player went more for the intrigue and made the surrounding provinces friendly while acquiring wealth, I did more campaigns and the 3rd player did a bit of both. Conan switched players quite often.
 I personally like this game but it seems to lack certain mechanics in the game play for most of the group who have played it so I am hoping the expansion will add new elements that will give the game more depth for the other players.

The rating on this game is probably lower than the quality of the design and production really deserve, but remember the rating is about how likely you are to play, so really it should be a 3 and I was being generous.

The problem isn't that Conan is a bad game, its fine. The problem is that there exist dozens of games that do the same thing better, several of them by the same company. I mean, if you had more time would you really play this in preference to Twilight Imperium? Or if you had less wouldn't Dust be better? Got just a little bit longer than a normal evening session? And you're really going to pick this over Warrior Knights?

The fate dice have so little impact the players might as well just be offered a free range of actions, the strategy cards slow the game rather than providing genuinely important choices. Lots of things are fiddly, or just don't quite work as well as they should. It all adds up to something that is okay, but clearly not in the same league as its competitors.

One only for people who care more about the theme than the game play.

Comments based on watching a game being taught and played.  As a lover of "War of the Rings," I found "Conan" to be more abstract, less thematic and less involving -- in other words, not as good.  In "War" I found the long length to be balanced by the feeling that an epic story was advancing towards a spectacular conclusion.  "Conan" felt more like churning through the same thing through three ages.

--Mar2009-- Long.  (Our first game took more than 4 hours - but worse, it seemed Caylus-esque in that it threw the decisions and action of a much shorter game into that time period.  What's more, I spent a lot of time waiting while others made decisions that had no bearing on anything I might do.)  Random.  (There are a lot of factors entirely out of one's control.  Not just the dice, either:  the distribution of adventure tokens is enough to swing the game all on its own.  The rather variable utility of Kingdom cards is another factor out of one's control.)  Not entirely thematic.  (I like Tom's "Age of some generic fantasy game, with occasional cameos by Conan." description.  It matches my observations.)

I'm not terribly interested in playing again; I doesn't fill me with enthusiasm.  Won't be buying it.

I like this, but after one two and one four player game, still find it a bit clunky; interaction is limited by the game design, poor choices aren't punished enough (too many opportunities to catch up).

Game based on the Hyborean Age, an alternative early History of Mankind by Robert E. Howard.  Players represent powers struggling to control the known Earth using military and diplomatic methods.  Nevertheless, they have to keep an eye on Conan, a free soul that wanders around and that can be helpful if in your side and dangerous if not.  Nice light multiplayer wargame for those, like me, that want a little bit more strategy than just defeating your adversaries and conquer all around.  Its main mechanic, the action dice, is borrowed from other design from the same authors, [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=77&Itemid=1]War of the Ring[/url][/i], and is one of the best features of the game.

La producción es excelente, las cartas, las miniaturas... y su mayor pero para mí es la rejugabilidad, las estrategias ganadoras a seguir no son demasiadas, así como la necesidad de ser jugado necesariamente por 4 personas, so pena de que la experiencia de juego sea mucho peor. Todo ello hacen que sea un juego de jugar muy de vez en cuando.

Horribly underrated, this game manages to mash a number of mechanics together and they just work. It's got a bit of everything, except theme which is why I believe it fell so short in popularity. The action dice pool works well and IMO is an underused mechanic. You have bidding, a bit of deck building, hand management, area control. If there is one flaw I could find it's that it punishes you for attacking other players almost to the point where even if successful it hurts you more than them.

The dual control methods are an interesting dynamic. Getting a tower is relatively easy, but only gets you gold. It takes military conquest to get the victory points. The gold can help you in later military conquests, but you have to have a plan for how to exploit that gold to make it worthwhile.

I just thought it was too fiddly. If I control Conan and move him at the start of my turn, I get an adventure token, but if you choose a Conan die you don't move him but you do get an adventure token, but if I choose a Conan die I do move him but I don't get an adventure token but I can place a raider token. Huh?

RATING: 7
Хорошая стратегическая игра в "говардской" атмосфере. Про геймплей могу сказать, что в нём есть планирование, интрига, взаимодействие игроков, достаточно высокая вариантивность и немного здорового рэндома :). Высокое качество исполнения компонентов сильно порадовало. Отдельно приятно удивило как "вписан" Конан в игру: на протяжении всей игры бессмертный варвар не даёт о себе забыть в разных ипостасях. Также обрадовало наличие "характеров" держав, которые в сочетании с дургими мелочами дают эффект.
По прошествии времени и сыгранных партий могу сказать, что есть некоторый дисбаланс: интрига мало востребована, роль послов скатывается только на поборы денег из-за механики начисления ПО, что уменьшает простор для стратегии. Готовится аддон, возможно он исправит этот недостаток, во всяком случае роль Конана будет еще больше усилена, что не может не радовать.

If you are looking for a game that puts you in Conan's shoes, this is not it. Your role in the game is not that of Conan, but rather as a king in Conan's world.

Played twice...decent game, but I think there's less player interaction than I might like.  Very important for players to factor Conan-related VPs into their "who's winning" calculations.

I do quite enjoy Conan's interactions with the game.  The first game Conan led many military actions for the Conan player of the moment.  In the second we rolled an extraordinary number of Court+Conan dice and ended up with raiders everywhere that had to be dealt with.

I also like the objective cards a fair bit as they provide ready-made strategic goals for the players so it isn't all a "bash-the-winner" fest until the third age.

It is a shame that the true conflict of this game doesn't appear until the very end simply because it is much more VP-efficent to attack neutral territory than it is to take on an opponent in the hope that victory will simply make an area neutral. Not a bad game, but it is just easy to see how it could have been better.

Rating based on just one play. First impression is that the game looks and behaves like a conquest game, but eventually feels more like a set collection game. And the playtime doesn't justify that.
It will need to be played again. Preferably with a full group of people that have tried it at least once before, and the rating may go up after that.

RATING: 7
Somewhat of an "everything and the kitchen sink" design which seems rather typical of these big, flashy games that come out of FFG. Here we get served a game that almost - but not quite - manages to mix a huge number of different mechanics into a soup that is good, but falls short of being great.

True to the theme, this is a game of sorcery, battles and kingdom-building on grand scale. The rules are a tad clunky and our first play had us scrambling for the rules, cheat sheets and FAQs almost constantly. There are a few things that disappointed me on my first play, including that despite drawing a ton of cards (playing Hyperboria), I somehow failed to draw a single "play on the table" card, which are the ones that can be refreshed and reused. It was just terrible luck considering that I drew about 15 cards, but it was annoying. More concerning to me was that just about all the objective cards gave points for doing things in the red region near Aquilonia's home kingdom and - surprise - Aquilonia was able to accomplish them far more easily than anyone else and ran away with the game (though admittedly not for this reason alone). Again, perhaps just bad luck, but this was nearly unbalancing. Other than that, even when inelegant, the rules all seemed to work and contribute to a decent game engine. It's too long to get to the table often, but Age of Conan does what I had hoped ... successfully conveying the rich theme of Robert E. Howard's and Conan's world and mythos, and doing so on a grand, satisfying scale. The way Conan meanders through the provinces, sometimes helping and sometimes hindering players, is a great mechanic. Age of Conan isn't perfect, but it certainly succeeds on many levels and is something I'll seek to play now and again when a game session allows the lengthy time investment.

RATING: 5
It's very important what type of adventure tokens you get. But there's bar to none control over it. And so it seems like whoever gets to control Conan by the start of the third age first will be able to get a major part needed for a victory by crowning Conan. And getting to control Conan also is a game of chances. 
I read some arguments of the Conan-mechanics being uninspired. True! The great barbarian seems a little lost moving from point A to point B and sometimes back to point A again without having completed a quest. But I think it still shines in comparison to the gameplay in between, that offers a lot of "cold war" (build up armies to scareoff not to fight) and unnecessity to fight players since there's lots of neutral realms to attack. In that way it reminded me of Warrior knights. The game is over when it starts to get interesting. Not whatI was expecting.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First Play, 4P--Wow, what a tough game to rate.  On our first playing, it was a cold session--we read the rules on the spot and then commenced playing.  So, it was more than a little daunting, especially at 4+ hours.  

There does seem to be a decent game, but it will require another play or two to decide if it is worth it.  Right now, if I had to lean one way, I'd say it is not.

I was decidedly underwhelmed by this game.  The components are beautiful and it has some really interesting design features -- the fate dice, the way battles are resolved, the differences in player kingdom decks.  But gameplay was long and just somehow uninspiring.  If this were a 90 minute game, I might be inclined to give it a couple more plays to see if I missed something.  But given Conan's play time and how little I actually saw in it, I just don't have the motivation to try again.

This rating could change given a second play.

Pros: Having soldiers and emissaries makes sense; reminiscent of the movie; interesting factional differences; good missions and objectives; screwage factor in trying to make Conan fail to hurt the controlling player; lots of ways to score points.

Cons:  The game's rules are a bit too restrictive and make this one feel overly linear.  It takes a long time to consolidate the central western kingdom as opposed to the other three kingdoms.  As a game, it is good, but as a war game, it kind of sucks.  The combat system is inane and takes forever.  The campaigns against neutrals take forever and expend tons of resources.  It takes a very long time for things to come to a head between the players and then the tension is killed by all of the tediously long die rolls.  The attacker is superlatively favored in the game.

Age of Conan is a boardgame which puts players in control of one of the major kingdoms of the Hyborian age, in the period of history well known through the tales of the adventures of Conan the Cimmerian, the barbarian hero created by Robert E. Howard.

You will fight with armies, sorcery and intrigue to make your kingdom the most powerful of its age, and to secure on your side the mightiest hero of all – Conan the Cimmerian!

Overview of the Game

In Age of Conan, you control one of the major kingdoms of the Hyborian Age – Aquilonia, Turan, Hyperborea and Stygia.

You will build up and use your armies and emissaries, you will enhance your actions with your kingdom cards, and you will try to take advantage of the adventures of Conan to increase the power and wealth of your kingdom.

The game is played over the course of three ages. At the beginning of each age, four Conan adventure cards are drawn and used to create the adventure deck. At the beginning of each adventure, players will bid to decide who will be the Conan player for that adventure; when an adventure ends, a new one is drawn and a new bid determines who will be the new Conan player.

The roll of the fate dice is used to determine the actions available to the players. The dice are rolled to form a common pool from which all players will pick their dice. Each player, in turn, will choose and use one fate die and will be able to do one of the actions allowed by that die result.

When the fate dice are all used, they are rolled again and the game continues in this way until all four adventures in the adventure deck are complete. At that point, the game will temporarily stop so that players may earn gold and take several kingdom–building actions in preparation for the next age.

If you are a Nexus or FFG fan, this is definitely one you should check out.

If you are expecting Conan the Adventure Game, then walk away.  Battles of the Hyborean Age would have been more fitting.

That being said, there is lot this game has to offer.  At its heart is a tactical war game.  Also, it seems to be fairly balanced, as many of the final scores are typically within only a few points of one another.

A highly enjoyable wargame/strategy hybrid with a lot going on. Conan is unfortunately relegated to being a part time player however. Some games he will be the difference between a win and a loss, others he will be merely a nuisance or a side quest that just takes up some time. That is all well and good in my opinion as it makes the sessions varied and replayability high.

Disastrous rule book, but that's what you can expect from the FFG. We played only the first age, then we had realized that there were so many rules, that we had played wrong, that we decided to end the game and count the points.

Looking forward to the next game, then the rules should be better known and the game should be smoothier. One solo game before the real game might have done miracles.

Updated after second play, we didn't manage to finish this time either. The rulebook still sucks, but we managed to get the rules quite right. For some reason the game just went on and on, may be we were just poor players. Anyway, rated this as 4 as I don't feel like playing this one anymore.

Easily one of my biggest disappointments in any game. I LOVE the Conan theme/story and this game has some great ideas. This game is fiddly and too rule heavy. Spent far too much time looking up even the smallest rules. It's possible to not even impede on another player's area in an area control game which is crazy. With a retool of rules this game could be great but as it stands is one of my least favorite to date. Positive notes are Great components, theme and art.

Essentially this is a remake of the original War of the Rings board game reworked this time to suit four factions instead of the customary free people vs Sauron's minions. Conan supposedly takes up the role that the fellowship has in the game and adds randomness and potential bonuses to the faction which manages to control him. As usual, sequels and remakes are almost never better than the original, especially when one takes into account the hefty price tag.

The premise of the game is about as entertaining to me as the game itself: While the kingdoms of Hyboria are locked in their struggle for dominance, each attempts to bribe Conan to prevent him from [i]single-handedly destroying them[/i]. I can just picture two armies preparing to stand off against each other, only to run in fear at the sight of the world's most badass barely-clothed berzerker.

A solid game of conquest based on a Euro point scoring system with plenty of ways to get the points.  You're going to need to conquer as well as stay a player for adventure counters.  A perfect blend of 60% Ameritrash with 30% Euro strategy and 10% luck of the dice (there's plenty of ways to mitigate that luck).  You'll like this game if you like conflict, dice rolling, and of course the Conan theme world.

Rating according to the BGG rating scale: "Likely won't play it again". Although i think the game would deserve a rating of 5 for gameplay, if it weren't that long.

It was a 7 hour experience. Ok, that's including rules explanation (nobody had played before, but one guy had read the rules in detail and explained them). And including many instances of searching something in the rules during the game. And including one AP prone player. But still, 7 hours is far too long for what the game offers. I can imagine cutting it down to 4 hours for a second game without that one player, but still - i just read 90 minutes in the game description? How on earth can that be possible?

And the game itself - gameplay was boring and quite repetitive. And far too much luck for the playing time. I don't mind a high amount of luck in a 30 minutes game, but for a 3+ hours game, i prefer games decided by skill.

Competing warlords building forts, garrisons and cities and expanding their kingdom by diplomacy or special dice combat and multi-use strategy cards.  Bid for control of Conan over three ages of adventure decks to use to their advantage.  Sorcery, emissaries and military, gold, event cards, and objectives.  A lot going on and a lot to keep track of.

The rules are great and having played it at least a dozen times at Spiel 2008 in Essen, I'm a huge fan! I love Robert E. Howard's writing and the pastiche items, such as the Sword of Atlantis, that have slipped into the game sort of give me a rash, but otherwise it's damn near perfect. It's great how the entire kingdom expansion and domination aspect takes place to the backdrop of Conan's adventures, and fighting to crown Conan your king fits the theme to a tee.

Great game. A bit luck-dependant but I still love it. 
Fist had a problem with the whole idea (fighting other players in 2nd/3rd turn but after that the true gaming experience started).
4 kingdoms - 4 different strategies. Due to the Fate Dice system each payer has to adapt his play - it makes players do every avilable action, not just their favourite. So change and use all you can get!

And yes, Conan! - he can help you rise or make you fall very quickly  - nasty :)

Fun, but long. I enjoy the excellent minis, the action dice and the combat. Other features, such as diplomacy, seem a little underutilized to me. The game drags on a bit long, with a lot of preparation for only a little actual inter-player warfare. Added to all this, there are about a million different rules to remember and explain, some of which are not very intuitive. Overall, a bit complicated and long for what it is, although it is still very fun.

A Risk-type wargame that provides a lot of flavor, plenty of action cards, and some mechanics to break up the constant onslaught (such as set collecting and simultaneous bidding). It can be a bit long, and difficult to explain. The game is originally Italian, so the translation is a bit clunky in spots (this is minor, though). The main drawback for me is that a lot of the combat in the game isn't against another player, but against the board itself. Another player will roll the dice, sure, but you're not actually killing his/her armies.

There is so much potential with this game! They thought of everything when creating it and the rules are very clear and easy to follow. Though the rule book is big, it is filled with lots of examples to illustrate game play. This is the perfect game for those who are looking for a miniatures based war game. I would liken it to the greatest computer ame of all time, X-Com: UFO Defense.

It's like X-COM, but in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic America, and it's a bit too difficult to kill things. There's other things that I don't like about it, but overall I like it for the awesome theme and interesting tactical combat.

Despite the post-apocalyptic theme, Earth Reborn was designed and produced with a lot of love.  The design is a tour-de-force, brashly integrating something like a dozen different mechanics and yet gameplay is quite smooth and straightforward.   The production values are top-notch, ranging from the beautiful oversized rulebooks with extensive, well-done artwork to the extremely functional storage tray.   (Something which FFG is completely clueless about;  a stoopid folded cardboard insert may get the game delivered to me intact, but after that, it's off to recycling for you!)    

In fact, I think it will take the gaming community a very long time to truly appreciate just what a milestone, what an achievement Earth Reborn is.  I hope the designer and publisher will take the "long view" with this game, and patiently develop it over the years with expansions.

Update:  We still haven't finished all of the training scenarios, but we're having fun getting through them!

Update:  We've stalled out on moving through the training scenarios.  I was going to hold off on rating until we could get to the full game, but I'll give it a 7 for now.  I would really like to revisit this one and make it to the full game.

I just can't will myself to bring this one to the table. Oh, I understand who the game is designed for, and how it accomplishes this and everything, but the learning curve involved and all of the chit pulls and just the slew of mechanisms involved just don't feel like a worthwhile investment to me.

Claustrophobia does the adventure game thing better, for me, and Mage Knight is where it's at if I'm looking for some sort of epic adventure.

Very interesting 2 player miniature game. Cool Sci-Fi theme, amazing production, a lot of stuff in the box. Nice mechanics (some of them very innovative like the 'searching the room' deck), players are free to try any kind of crazy things they can think of. I really like that each scenario adds just a bit more rules than the previous one. You really need a dedicated partner to explore the game with.

Let's get the not so good stuff out of the way first.

This game has some gnarish visual design elements (mainly the cards), a huge barrier to entry (long setup time, complex rules) and is costly. BUT...

... it is also one of the finest game I've played in a long time. It comes with amazing components (super detailed minis!), is packed full of rules covering most options you can think of, has great tutorial scenarios that slowly teach you the game stepwise, and has a random scenario generator so you will never play the same game twice. 

Not to mention that each play of the game tends to tell a story in itself. 

I almost gave this game up after my initial play, but I'm glad someone convinced me otherwise, and now I'm loving this gem.

Not for me. The rules only seem to be complex but are quite easy to learn and seem to encompass everything you would wish for in a tactical skirmish game. However, the learning scenarios are not overly exciting and may deter people too soon.

Setup is painstakingly tedious and gameplay similarly drags on and on without giving the feeling of accomplishing much.

Would love to see a computer game made out of this in the same vein as Jagged Alliance. As a board game it is too time consuming without giving back an adequate amount of fun.

RATING: N/A
I REALLY want to like this game, but the setup to actual play time ratio is somewhat of a turnoff. Add to this the fact that I've taught it to three different people thus far with no one willing to commit to learning and growing with the game, and it's longevity on my shelf is rapidly waning. This game really needs dedicated players who will stick with it to get the most bang for the buck.

EDIT 7/19/12: Well my son finally expressed interest in playing and we had a blast playing through the first three scenarios. Rethinking whether or not I want to trade.

Really, I don't see what's enjoyable here.  The chit mechanic seems like 'mechanics for the sake of mechanics'.  The combat is fairly unexciting, although the system for that is fairly simple.

My dream miniatures game. Self-contained, full of depth, plenty of obscure (yet easy-to-learn) side rules. The first nine scenarios can be played multiple times, but the REAL game begins once you and another player have mastered the core ruleset and you can now begin playing with randomized and player-made missions. I would rate it a Perfect 10 if not for the clunky map-creation mechanics (I would have gladly taken a handful of pre-made map boards)

Kíváncsi voltam, milyen a legmagasabbra értékelt öldöklős amerikai típusú játék, amely rendületlenül menetel a top10 felé (ezzel kategóriájában egyedülálló). Nincs nagy ismeretem ebben a műfajban, csak néhány hasonló jellegű játékot próbáltam (Odalent, Doom). Ez sokkal erősebb játék azoknál, mégis csak az Odalenttel megegyező pontszámot adok rá, mert ebbe valahogy nem tudtam annyira beleélni magam.
Kezdem a pozitívumokkal: bár több ismerősöm szerint ez csak egy felturbózott Doom, nekem 1-1 parti alapján ez teljesen más volt. Jóval árnyaltabb, ötletesebb mechanizmusokból áll: pl. a látómező, akciópontok elosztása, tárgyak szerzése alapelemek a műfaj többi darabjánál is, viszont eddig ebben a játékban láttam ezek legjobb megvalósításait. A kidolgozás elsőosztályú, a játék pörgős, leköti az embert. Rengeteg érdekesség került bele: fogoly ejtés, foglyok kínzása, ötletes tárgyak, pl. rádiót lehet zavarni, stb. Ikonrendszer elképesztően sok információt közöl viszonylag jól érthetően, a paravánon annyi információ van, mint egy egyszerűbb játék teljes szabálya, ezzel együtt jól áttekinthető.
Negatívumok: A szabály elmondása 2 órát vett igénybe, ki- és bepakolással, scenario kiválasztásával és felrakásával együtt kb. 3 és fél óra ment el a "körítésre", miközben maga a játék másfél óra volt. 
Nagyon jól egybe van gyúrva az amúgy komplex rendszer, de azért ez így sok egy ilyen rövid játékhoz (na jó, lehet éppen hosszabb is, akár 3-4 órás). Olyan körülményes a pakolászás, hogy legközelebb csak akkor veszem elő, ha több menetet játszunk egyhuzamban. A gond az, hogy a szabályt addig tuti elfelejtem. A játék alapváltozata egyébként nem nyelvfüggő, ha van aki elmondja a szabályokat.
Ez az a fajta játék, aminek a jobb megismeréséhez legalább 15-20 játék kellene, mert elég sokféle játékmód van, sokféle céllal, stb. Örülök, hogy kipróbáltam, de valószínűleg nem lesz kedvenc.
A szerencse szerepéről lehetne vitatkozni, az biztos, hogy én szerencsével nyertem:) 2 fővel ajánlott, de így hárman se volt rossz.
---
A második partinál a korábban leírtak közül csak a negatívumok jöttek hangsúlyosan elő... a korábbi tapasztalatok ellenére elkövettük azt a botorságot, hogy ismét 1 parti kedvéért elővettük a játékot. Előpakolás, elpakolás, szabálymagyarázat... volt összesen kb. 3 óra, a játék maga 1 óra... Nagyon körülményes a pályaépítés. Miért volt szükség ennyi fajta pályaelem-méretre??? Öncélú, és nagyon körülményessé teszi az elpakolást. Aki ezt szereti, annak hajrá, nekem erre nincs időm. Egyébként nem rossz játék, de csak azoknál fog tudni kibontakozni, akik napokat rászánnak, jó sok küldetést végignyomnak. Nekünk így a 2 parti alapján nem is derült ki mire képes a játék, de szerintem nem is fog.

Played first six 2 pls scenarios plus first 3-4 pls scenario. Amazingly rich in detail and fun. Tempted to buy the hand painted miniatures. Only gripe so far (which might go away when I finally get to the mythical SAGS): most missions seem to involve deciding where to go and going there, with little chance of switching to plan B along the way, especially if some enemy is blocking the crucial corridor/door. This might make for hours of excruciating stab/fire/heal in the same little area, which seems like a waste given the long setup times.

RATING: 7.5
Must play more advanced scenarios to fully appreciate the game. I only played the simplest scenario (move+melee) and I am not enthusiastic about it. 
However I dislike the graphic design on the cards. Illustrations are good, and the cover is great. But the cards and all that info, they are badly presented. For that much info, the illustration and a simple numbered table with no icons at all would be better. Also, less satin effect and better color choices could be useful.

RATING: 9
Initial Impression: This is a great tactical game involving minis, random missions, and a board drafting mechanism. The game has many "euro-ey" subsystems that look complex on initial viewing but it all comes together and makes sense. I'm still running through the "learning scenarios", which aid in introducing the mechanisms in progressive layers. This is a brilliant game.

10 Plays: My wife and I finally made it past all the learning scenarios and onto SAGS. I must say that learning SAGS finally overwhelmed us. I see the potential of the system but I think it'll take a few more tries in order to feel comfortable with the system. The overall story-arc for the tutorial scenarios was very well done and left us with a strong impression of the background of both the factions and the world. I look forward to the next 10 plays, as I believe this is where the game will really shine.

20 Plays: Having come back to this game a few years later, it's a testament to the tutorial system that I was able to remember the majority of the rules and iconography with just a minimal initial glance at the rulebook. A quick 5 minute review and I was up and running as if I hadn't shelved the game 2 years earlier. Finding consistent players has been a challenge but this game is definitely worth it. The wealth of tactical options, the theme and story driven play, ... there's still nothing quite like it. A gamer buddy has enjoyed it so much that he's acquired his own copy as well.

4/22/12: I am almost done painting the figures, and we've only played the first 3 scenarios, but this game is very promising. Most of my complaints are aesthetic. The board doesn't have enough contrast (What, there is a wall there?). On the plus side, the minis are very well done.

For a tactical combat game, ER offers a huge amount of choice and some neat mechanics. It is too bad that it seems to be a dead title.

5/27/12: I am done painting the figures. I am no longer so keen on the game. It can be very difficult to get things done, from planting a mine to dealing damage. When a figure goes through a lot of effort just to plant a mine and fails, that seems pretty silly. Is it representing unreliable equipment? All in all, movement and blocking seems too important at least in the some of the scenarios. If the blocker hasn't blocked well, the runner can just run run run to victory.

So in some ways this seems more like an elaborate puzzle than a combat game. I'm left feeling like I'd rather play a Savage Worlds Showdown or just a game of Descent, so I'm not sure we'll even find the time to finish the tutorial scenarios. This feels like a giant disappointment after I painted the figures...I guess my new mantra should be: "play first, then paint", rather than "nothing hits the table until it is painted".

For now I'm removing my 8 rating and setting it as unrated.

This is really quite a cool system in many respects. I very much like the hidden Euro elements of tile selection; not being able to do completely what I wanted to do made each turn a fun puzzle to work out. When I could set something beautiful up it felt intellectually and thematically satisfying. I'm not convinced that some of the more marginal (later in the tutorial) rule elements aren't a little tacked on (radio scrambling) but they can be set aside with no problem. Really, though, the game feels like two or three expansions have already been packaged inside so you can't fault the box for having some elements you don't want to use. It's as tremendous value and has tremendous potential, particularly for gamers who enjoy tactical minis. My gaming group decided this wasn't for them because they wanted a much breezier ("roll and move?") game if they were playing a tactical game. Despite the existence of the 3/4 player scenarios, it does seem to be much better as a two player game after all, too. If you have a buddy who enjoys thinky games, tactical minis, and thematic games -- and you want to invest several sessions to really get into the guts of a game (it's not good for an "every now and then game") -- this might just be the perfect title for you.

Del mismo diseñador que el Dungeon Twister. Ambientado en un futuro postapocaliptico. Se enfrentan dos facciones de humanos que han evolucionado de forma diferente: Los NORAD, más tecnológicos, y los SALEMITAS, que han descubierto la forma de revivir a los muertos. El juego se desarrolla por escenarios, y en cada escenario el objetivo es diferente. Incluye 9 escenarios primeros y en cada uno de ellos se van introduciendo nuevas reglas, así que tiene una curva de aprendiaje muy estudiada. 
En cada turno hay una fase de iniciativa, otra de asignacion de órdenes y una fase final. Cada jugador maneja uno o varios personajes de una facción y cuando le asigna una orden, debe invertir puntos de comando para definir en qué intensidad se realizan las acciones.
Los componentes y el aspecto está muy cuidado y el juego, aunque recuerda vagamente al dungeon twister (cada personaje tiene sus características),  tiene muchas más posibilidades, por la cantidad de acciones que se pueden realizar.
De momento, una primemera impresión muy buena, y eso que sólo he jugado los dos primeros escenarios.

Después del cuarto escenario, subo la nota a 8.5. Disparos, equipamiento, interacción e iconografía. Grandes y originales aportaciones a lo que ya conocía del juego.

Tras el quinto escenario le subo la nota a 8.8. La mecánica de búsqueda es muy elegante y aporta nuevo sabor al juego.

RATING: 8.5
Del mismo diseñador que Dungeon Twister. Es un juego ambientado en un mundo postapoaliptico en el que se enfrentan dos facciones (Norad y salemitas). El jugador maneja a algunos personajes en pequeñas misiones configuradas en escenarios. Cada personaje tiene unas características propias y además puede interactuar con el escenario de diversas formas. Es un pedazo de juego. Además, el reglamento es de lo mejor que me he encontrado en mucho tiempo. Va introduciendo paulatinamente las reglas del juego a través de un circuito de nueve escenarios. Aprendes a jugar casi sin darte cuenta. De otro modo, serían demasiadas reglas. Yo aún voy por el escenario cinco y ya me parece un juego glorioso. No se qué pensaré cuando llegue al noveno. :)

One of my friend's owns this, and ultimately it is a decent scenario based tactical game. The amount of icons on everything is a bit overwhelming, but the gameplay is pretty intuitive. The flavor text and storytelling done in the scenarios are full of wit and creativity. The game pieces are all high quality and the gameplay is kind of fun. It definitely works better as a two player game! Do not even try it with 3 or 4! Unless your teammate thinks exactly like you prepare to be super frustrated. The way combat is done is unique, but I'm not a huge fan of the mechanic. I will play this game occasionally, but It is not one of my favorites, and I never see myself adding it to my own collection.

Un concepto de juego muy diferente a todo lo que he jugado hasta el momento: dos facciones enfrentadas, con personajes que tienen que llevar a cabo misiones. Infiltración, rescate, combate cuerpo a cuerpo o con armas, secuestro, tortura...


 Solo con probar el primer tutorial, que ya es el juego en sí, en el que se aprende la mecánica general junto a moverse y a pelear, deja una gran sensación de profundidad, pero especialmente que deja con ganas de aprender nuevas reglas.

Pero el juego no es únicamente una ensalada de dados (que también) si no que tiene un gran componente estratégico y de "faroleo". 

Y por otra parte, los componentes son excepcionales, con un precio bien ajustado.

Excelente.

Earth Reborn is basically a mini-based tactical combat game (like Warhammer) with a board.  I avoided it for a while, mostly because it is big, expensive, and I knew it would take a while to learn.  We also weren't bowled over by the theme; even though we both love zombies, this seemed a little too Mad Max for our tastes.  Happily, these fears have been allayed.  The learning curve is not steep - in fact, the rulebook makes the best use of the "incremental, programmed" learning approach (as in CoH) I've seen.  What really makes this game great, and unlike other minis games, is that it uses Euro elements.  The action chit system is brilliant, streamlined, and once you've learned it, almost a no-brainer.  This is partly because everything makes sense thematically, but also because certain concepts (like using action points to add extra dice) pertain across combat, searching, interacting, and so on.  This is a game system in terms of the heartiness of the rules and the amount of material in the box, but the beauty is once you learn the basics, you'll rarely need to refer to the rules.   That said, I'd love to see some more factions and minis for this one.  I like the fact that NORAD and the Salemites are so asymmetrical, but at the same time, I'm always the one stuck playing the Salmeites, and I'd like some firepower, dammit!  (I know, once we get to the SAGS this shouldn't be as much of a problem, but I have mech envy right now).

My original copy had many problems.  To be frank, the die-cutting was shit.  There is a lot of cardboard in the game, and about 1/4 of it, although playable, was pretty ugly (think action chits with the backing ripped off, disfigured room pieces, etc).  Z-Man made good on the replacement parts, as I was sure he would, and I guess it's a testament to Z-Man that this is the first game he's published I've ever had component issues with.  Anyway, be aware that if you get a copy of this, you might have some issues too.  But one issue won't be wanting to play this thing - it is deep, and simulates pretty much anything and everything.  Tactical combat doesn't get much better, and we've actually warmed to the theme!  How can you not feel something for a baddie who has problems with chronic diarrhea?

Just another quick follow-up, based on limited play: I can't help but feel like the 3/4-p versions are a bit tacked on to what is really a 2p game. The NORAD faction really doesn't have enough characters - only 3 really, plus the giant battle-suit - to meaningfully handle more than one player. The 3/4-player SAGS system in the rulebook is basically just 3/4-player "king of the hill" free-for-all and will have all the problems associated with that genre.

So anyway. I found the game intriguing, but I wish the multiplayer options were more robust.
---
Played once, I actually rather liked it, although it got mixed reviews from the other players. I think the scenario we played (Zombie Family 4p from the website) wasn't great, the CP/order chit tension felt a little out of whack. I think it would be a lot better with either 2p or a bigger 4p game (several characters per player). I think it's got potential, but it's also probably a game that requires more repeat play to appreciate than I can likely give it.
---
An odd, very French game. For me, I'm always looking for a few sorts of games to triangulate between myself and some of my friends who have significantly different tastes. This looks like a neat combination of a FFG-style chromy theme with an interesting action-adventure wargame. And it has zombies. The game system seems more solid and playable than anything FFG does, without sacrificing the trashy aspects that make their stuff appealing. Anyway, it's a risky buy for me, this is not the sort of thing that's usually up my alley, but the wargame systems seem legit, it seems to have potential, and I'm looking forward to trying it.

One of my all-time favorites.  The miniatures and components are gorgeous.  The tetris-like tile design is ingenius and provides for unlimited replayability.  The method of teaching the rules through a chapter followed by a scenario is also very useful and a fun ride.  

The meat of the game is the SAGS mode which offers randomly generated scenarios with hidden objectives from your opponent.  You draft your force (including starting equipment) and go to war.  The gameplay is engaging and deep.  I can't say enough good things about this game.

The game does have a couple of flaws.  The first is the length.  The actual game doesn't take prohibitively long, however, map setup for a SAGS game can take from 30-60 minutes (it's a game in and of itself with layered strategy).  

ER also does not handle multiple players as smoothly as I'd like.  I'm yearning for a team SAGS mode, but unfortunately all we have is an every man for himself mercenary mode.  This loses the flavor of the included factions as you split the characters between different players and ignore the game's backstory.

1) Sense of wonder: Great story and replayability. The scenarios are all interesting and the game itself has an overall story which is very flavorful. The theme of this game is very interesting and engaging.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Lots of tough decisions to make throughout the game. The use of the action tokens is s very cool idea and makes for some agonizing decisions.

3) Player interaction: you are killing each other. What's not to like. 

4) Components/artwork:  The minis are great, but the artwork on the board it terrible. I can't make heads or tails of where a tile starts and stops because of poor color choices.

5) Game length/complexity: The game is the perfect length as far as playtime, but set up and tear down is WAY too fiddly. this is coming from a guy who loves all the commands and colors games, doom, and descent all of which have tons of setup. This game however suffers because of the difficulty in setup due to colors of tiles as well as the math puzzle that is the insert that came with the game.

RATING: 10
Let me get this out of the way: I am a total Earth Reborn fanboy.

I have been wanting to play a game like this since I first got into board games. A game that mixes tactical miniatures battle with modular board construction, automatic scenario generation, a strong theme that is reflected in the gameplay, and a wide amount of options. 

Earth Reborn is that game.

Now I will admit, Earth Reborn is a highly complex game. There are A LOT of rules to learn, and it can be very intimidating to learn and teach to other players. However, once you read through the rules carefully and follow the tutorial all of the elements of the game really start to come together.

There is so much game here that I have barely been able to scratch the surface of it, but the beauty of Earth Reborn is that the gameplay is so deep, strategic, and variable, that I will be playing this game for years. 

This is one of the most impressive board games I have ever had the opportunity to play in my life, but it is also one of the most intimidating. 

If you have the time to learn the rules, and someone to teach to the game to and play it with, do not hesitate to buy this game.

An interesting tactical game that scratches a few itches of mine. The action system is both clever but limiting. I can't tell yet if I like this mechanic or not.

Went through the first few scenarios a couple times each and loving it so far.  Many players comment on not wanting to go through the scenarios and jump right into S.A.G.S. but you miss way too much going that route.

Luck-drenched chrom-a-sauraus that is indeed quite fun. The garish production goes against my preference for Winsomey sleekness, but all the little bits do seem to add up to a reasonably well-built game. Just not really the way I'd like to spend my gaming time on a regular basis. For the lighter wargaming, I'd rather go for Columbia blocks. For heavier stuff, I'd rather go for Simmons' games. I'm glad I tried it.

This game has a pretty steep learning curve, and the fiddly parts may eventually outweigh the reward (bidding for interruptions, tracking the different order tiles), but it's currently a tense, interesting experience.  Even playing through the nine intro scenarios yields lots of exciting gameplay.  The concept of separating orders and command points does make for some tough decisions, as you try to do the best with what you have.  The theme is excellent - a must for a game like this, and the components are all beautiful.

A monumental achievement in game design.

Surprisingly easy to learn via the scenario-tutorial guide, incredibly deep and wonderfully balanced 'make your own scenario' feature, and an absolute hoot to play.

The only downside is making sure you play the tutorial through with someone so they know how the game flows, as it is a deeply tactical affair and one player being slightly better will skew any game fairly badly.

Honestly one of my favourite games ever. A huge surprise.

Guess Space Hulk won't get played by us too much now.  ER is just way more open in terms of strategy/tactics.  Digging it a bunch now in our sixth (?) game - scenario 5.

Feb 2012 - nope, got SH third edition, so we will play both!  ER rulez.

Sept 2012 - Just a terrific video game feel with complete openness.  Sandbox!

June 2013 - After 21 sessions, I've made it through scenario 9. Ready for S.A.G.S., dogg. "Combine" is rad.

June 2014 - Two games of S.A.G.S. completed. Best way to play. Setup is a mini-game. 

May 2017 - Ten games of S.A.G.S. completed. Game just gets deeper as you go. So many aspects to consider during setup and play to get the jump on your opponent. There's MUCH more to this game than I thought, even after finishing the nine learning scenarios. 

Errata courtesy of Sphere:

page 19 Picture #20: In the example, the order tile should have a Shoot order section with a value of "3" to allow Jack Saw to spend 3 CP on it.
-page 32 Picture #43: The automatic hits add up to 4, not 5.
-page 35, Mission Point icons (bottom-right of the page): The NORAD and Salemite icons are switched.
-page 40, Cherokee Bill entry: If you activate his IPS line when he is on his Wounded side, you only get one Spy Point, not two (the text has a typo, the IPS line is correct).

-In scenario 4 the three floor square long corridor tile in the north-west part of the map is actually on the reverse side of the 3x1 outdoor tile located next to the T-shape tile in the north-east part of the map. Replace the outdoor tile with other outdoor tiles.

RATING: 9
Well-designed [u]modular[/u] SCI-FI tabletop skirmish miniatures game (possibly the best tactical miniature game out!). It looks and feels like a good video-game. The terrain looks different on each game. Each scenario allows a high tactical and narrative experience with tons of possibilities (shooting, stabbing, destructible environments, mines, bombs, radio scrambling, Jet packs, claws, reanimation, healing, smoke screens, spying, torture, imprisonment, corruption, love etc.). Each turn the players have many choices and they are elements of secrecy and bluff incorporated into the system. Infinite replayability via the 'Scenario Auto Generating System'. Top notch components and there's so much game in one box - huge value for it's price!
Drawbacks: Not good for casual sessions because it has a step (re)learning curve. It's hard to bring it to the table because it's a complex game and has a long setup. Also, managing the tokens can be fiddly.
I speed-painted the miniatures. I play with open information (no information behind the screen).
Works [color=red]solitaire[/color] playing both sides and using the [i]jbr1981[/i] duel variant: [i]When the "opposant" can interrupt the action of the "current player", roll a yellow die. If the die indicates 1, 2 or 3 shots, you have the choice to pay as many CPs as indicated by the die to cancel the interruption (in this case only the "current player" spend its CPs), or you can spend nothing, and the "opposant" interrupts the action automatically and freely (this "player" does not pay any CPs).[/i]

Finally, the miniature tactical gaming that are near perfect. I really loves deep complex game, and this game really offers a lot of aspects that you could do as persons in the game. But the greatest part is you can teach elements of the game modularly and step by step. So it's great for casual gamer, but also can deliver great game for hardcore gamer.

Usually I hate scenarios. Since in the game with scenario, I don't know which scenario should I use to "compare" my skills with opponents that are widely accepted as common full blown all aspects of the game. Well, in here, each scenario just a teaching tools, in which also its own good game, but the real deal is SAGS

Scenario Auto Generating System. How cool is that? You can build random map. Not only that, you can play up to 4 players too!! This will create infinite possibilities and replayability.

The rulebook is very well written, but i would've prefered it if it was half it's length. The rules are definitely not that hard to understand, yet they split the learning process into a tutorial process that discourage more players than it brings new ones in.

Read the rules twice, then go directly into SAGS (the play-mode after the tutorials), do not play the tutorial scenarios, and get the enjoyment of this game right away. After a single game where you stumble a bit, you'll understand it properly. In your second game, you'll play properly. Way faster than playing 9 long tutorial scenarios...

As for the game itself, it's a very good game and it offers lots of replay value. It just lacks maybe one more miniature for the Norad faction to allow them more choice when starting.

I wanted to like Earth Reborn more, but it was way too clunky.  I liked the combat once I for used to it.  It did seemed like a lot of steps for something that is usually taken care of with a quick dice throw.  I don't know if it was just the scenario we played, but the map assembly was a real pain also.  There seemed to be a lot of depth there, but I don't think i would have the patience to find it all.

Very impressive game design. I played only the first five scenarios, but I can see this game having HUGE replayability (I have not even played the NORAD faction yet). Tactical miniatures games are normally not my type of game, but this one really stands out. Despite the long setup and teardown, I'm looking forward to playing the remaining scenarios and trying out the SAGS. I'm simply amazed at what the designer has come up with here. For being a tactical game, it's not as tedious as I thought. The components are incredible, and for the price, it's a steal. Very thick tiles (tons of them), nice mini sculpts, and quality cards and artwork (doublesided). 

This game is so open, it's amazing what you can do with your characters. Things like search a room for equipment, torture your enemy for information, use the zombie serum to reanimate corpses to fight for you, shut down the generator to cut off all power to the building, set off plastic explosives to breach a wall and access the vault, etc, etc. The interruption rules are very critical, and make for some very tough choices. 

The background story is very well thought out and well-written. Please don't review or rate this game until you have read these. They make the experience so much better. 

Update: I have played through Scenario 9 in sequence as the Salemite faction every time. Next time, SAGS!!

Udate: SAGS is definitely the way to play. Variable setup and random missions for each side make it a game with endless replayability. I'd still be happy going back to playing many of the scenarios as well though. Great game!

Complex system, neat scenario and rule introduction rulebook, haven't gotten through half of it and did not play the SAGS system. Needs a dedicated pair to play and that is what holds this game back.

I've only played a couple times but I enjoyed it. The mechanics felt deep without getting fiddly, and it never felt like a dice-fest that so many minis games degenerate into.

A small number of miniatures keeps in manageable. The rulebook does a good job of adding more complex rules in easy stages, with scenarios in between to give players a chance to absorb what they've learned before moving on to the next topic.

Oh, and it has a pretty cool theme. Thumbs up.

Oozes cool ideas but has some liabilities in play.  The setup is a major chore.  The scenarios can swing heavily in favor of one side with little warning.  I would like to delve further into the game to appreciate all the layers, but may not have the chance due to limited two-player opportunities.

RATING: 6
Initial rating after 1 play.  I don't think the rating will go down.  It will likely go up with more plays.  My issue with it was we started with scenario 4 I think (stealing the constitution).  There was just too much stuff going on for me to digest.  The basic rules of action points + character abilities + equipment + doors that open and close on their own + key'ed doors.  It wasn't clear how a lot of stuff worked until too late.

I ended up blowing a hole in the side of a building...killing off the scientist, stealing his key card.  But then the zombies took the key card and tried to refill the serum (apparently smart zombies). Then we clarified that the doors closed at the end of the turn. But I forgot this ruling we made half way through the game and my bruiser with the key card got killed due to not realizing he was targetting the wrong zombie.  He was going to try to kill him and steal the last key card.  By this time, I had my other 2 characters trapped behind doors without key cards. Through my lack of understanding of the rules, I stole defeat from the jaws of victory.  Way too much stuff going on for me.  Shoulda started off on the first scenario, but apparently they are not very good.

An incredibly deep, modular tactical combat game.  Each player controls a squad of troops (either the heroic NORAD or the evil zombie-controlling Salemites) across different scenarios with varying objectives.  You might not know your opponent's objective -- which is ok, because you can always capture one of his soldiers and torture him to try to find out.

My favorite game, unseating Arkham Horror and Battlelore in the process. You can do just about anything, but it's all intuitive, and simple to learn.

As a valentines present for my spouse, I chose to learn how to play earth reborn.  It took me close to two hours to separate out all the pieces and set up the board.  Several times I almost gave up, thinking the game would be too difficult.  Boy, was I ever surprised!

Earth Reborn is a campaign style game.  As you work your way through the scenarios you learn new rules.  So it is actually a lot easier to get into than I first thought.  What I liked:

-The game is laid out with all obstacles visible from the start.  If you want to punch your way through a wall to get to your opponent, you can start planning that from turn one.

-There is a bit of randomness regarding the order tiles.  You may not get the exact tile you want which forces you to rethink your strategy.

-Short to play.  We finished our first game in under an hour.  Both of us made tons of tactical errors but still had a blast.

I think this one will stick around for us.

Earth Reborn is simply one of the most amazing games I've ever played. It's a major oeuvre by a designer who has managed to incorporate a unique back story and theme, story-like RPG experience, and engaging gameplay with rich, tactical decisions. And you can create your own scenarios for Chrissake. Unfortunately, I punfully call it "a heartbreaking work of staggering genius" for how I’ve never gotten traction with the game. While I’ve played the learning scenarios, I’ve never played a true game of SAGS (scenario auto-generating system) which is how the game is meant to be played. /sniff

The brilliance of the design is the rich, thematically integrated game play that, despite the lengthy rulebook and overwhelming-at-first iconography, is actually as smooth as butter. The system manifests familiar concepts such as facing, LOS, opportunity fire, searching, terrain, and weaponry in an extremely intuitive system that has new players up and running immediately. The tile-based action system is akin to hand management in a CDG and creates a "fog of actions" in that you and your opponent don't know exactly what your characters are capable of. 

Thematically speaking, the game offers immense promise. The idea is good guys vs bad guys who are animating the undead to serve as warriors. There’s a brief backstory in the rules about how the earth got to this point and who these two factions of survivors are in this reborn world. The imagined world is rich and ripe for a campaign of some sort to tell its story. The characters are given wonderful backstories including one with a chronic GI problem (who starts the first scenario in the toilet) and another who has the ability to woo an enemy combatant (you have to read the story). 

You may have noticed that there are a lot of people gaga for this game, and the reason is that the game is a wonderful blend of clever mechanisms and thematic gameplay. There's just an incredible amount of bang for the buck in terms of rules to thematic play. On the downside, the game never caught on such that there are no expansions. The game sorely needs a campaign of some sort. The nine learning scenarios provide an ersatz one but a campaign system would go a long way to hooking players. 

It's a lot to digest, this one, and it's not a "pick up every now and then" kind of game, but if you have any interest whatsoever in a skirmish game and/or the post-apocalyptic theme (please note: while there are zombies here, it's not the traditional zombie genre), you owe it to yourself to check this one out.

ERRATA (courtesy of user sphere):
-page 19 Picture #20: In the example, the order tile should have a Shoot order section with a value of "3" to allow Jack Saw to spend 3 CP on it.
-page 32 Picture #43: The automatic hits add up to 4, not 5.
-page 35, Mission Point icons (bottom-right of the page): The NORAD and Salemite icons are switched.
-page 40, Cherokee Bill entry: If you activate his IPS line when he is on his Wounded side, you only get one Spy Point, not two (the text has a typo, the IPS line is correct).

-In Scenario 4, the 3-square long corridor tile in the north-west part of the map is actually on the reverse side of the 3x1 outdoor tile located next to the T-shape tile in the north-east part of the map. Replace the outdoor tile with other outdoor tiles.
-In Scenario 6, the Cryogenic Chamber must be rotated 180°

If you want an immersive, deep, dungeon crawl (without the dungeon) than this is very good.

Not sure I'd want a lot of these games, but this one is a keeper. Only complaints are a couple of illogical design decisions and an inability to play co-op.

Earth Reborn incorporates a lot of familiarities of other board games, just to mention a smattering:

Like Stronghold, plays up to 4, but really a 2-player game (Norad vs. Salemites).
Like Neuroshima Hex, Attack depends upon character's orientation. Also some characters can do long range & melee combat. 
Like Battlelore, teaching scenarios ease a player into game rules. Also, use of combat dice, Line of Sight.
Like Last Night on Earth, a background story exists, the board setup changes, character placement changes, and the winning conditions change.  Also miniatures present with other room elements.  Can pick up, pass items.

But the game also incorporates some things new to me: 
*Line of Sight varies from character to character & is depicted on the miniature's base.
*Attack strengths vary depending upon whether the character hits from the front, side and is depicted on the miniature's base. 
*When shooting, dice might be rolled to see if a target is in range, & if it is, rolled again for possible hits.

Initial impressions--What I like about this game, so far:
*Amazing rulebook, well written & illustrated.
*Instructional scenarios that keep me from feeling overwhelmed & lets me advance at my own rate. 
* Re-playability due to scenarios & numerous board combinations, & setups created by players.
*Character cards with complex info, but symbols very intuitive. 
*Attractive board & miniatures--and a perfect number to keep track of, just 12.
*Thematic--actually a story line that is interesting & results in a unique game.
*Quality company--missing piece replaced immediately.
*Tailor made insert
*The game can be played on any level--Players can choose to ignore more complex rules and game elements and still have a great game.

What I don't like:
*Almost impossible for a new player to jump into a game without starting from the beginning with the teaching scenarios.
*Setup extremely fiddly.
*With setup a game can take longer than 4 hours.
*Cards look a little rough (but doesn't detract from play). 
*Frequent rule review required with intermittent play.
*Lots of luck in dice driven fights.


Scenario #1: I spent about 4 hours setting up the game & reading the rules, which took much longer than the actual Scenario play.
Scenario #2 (x3 plays): During setup character markers are placed & then replaced by the miniatures.  During the Activation phase as soon as an active character enters a Line of Sight an Interruption can be called.  After this pause the active player resumes their round--but from where, and how many movements are left?  As in Ricochet Robots we found it important to mark the beginning square with the character marker.  Also added tokens which we place on character's cards when all actions used up for the turn.
Scenario #3 played (this is the end of the basics-movement, weapons, combat).
Scenario #4 (game starts getting more complex--introduces special abilities of characters, equipment, floor elements with a new set of dice.)

This is a more complex game than Battlelore or Neuroshima Hex, and even Stronghold.

Looking forward to frequent play.  I foresee this game having a huge & devoted cult following.

Wow. Here's a game that will reward you for putting the time into it. Yeah, setup takes too long due to the puzzle tetris-like tiles, and the walls don't have enough contrast to esaily make them out, and the first scenario or two are kind of limited in choices, but the game really starts to open ip with each scenario. Plus, painting the minis adds a significant element of immersion.

This game is a self generating story when it is played. I may have found my role playing subsitute - no GM needed, no planning or piles of books to buy into, instant story, and heavy replayability with logical, layered rules. Great game.

We're on Scenario 5, so we've worked through a substantial amount of the rules now. I can safely say this game is terrific.

It's fugly and looks complicated, but the rules are arguably simpler than people think: they are largely unambiguous and all the systems and their iconography are totally consistent. I've barely had to go back to the manual once we get a scenario underway.

The freedom and variety in this game, and the fact that the rules handle all of the actions that are available to me, is just amazing and quite satisfying. As someone else put it, the game is complex without being complicated; and that's quite enjoyable for me after fiddling with Descent for so long.

The only downsides that I can see are the set-up time (roughly 10-15 minutes for the larger maps), and the funky visual design here & there (though it grows on you).

Edit: It's heartbreaking to see this game become the best game no one has heard about.  I seriously hope they release an expansion for this regardless, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

Great systems that keep layering on as the scenarios progress.  Unfortunately it's only 2p so the time between games means we forgot all the fiddly rules and have to review them, making it less and less likely to get pulled out.

-----------

Most of the way through the scenarios now - there sure are a lot of rules and systems in play here but they seem familiar from other games and (mostly) involve common sense.

There's a lot of strategy here if you can remember all the possibilities.  The interrupt mechanic is great (though maybe a house rule that requires 1 pt min spend per interrupt would speed up the game).  Ranged combat seems pretty non-lethal (unless you get one of those rare 4 pt orders).  Haven't gotten to the capture/torture mechanics yet but they seem promising.

Christophe Boelinger has some amazing ideas with this one! (most of his games seem to be well thought out and inventive..even if fiddly.) Reminds me of the old Fallout PC games in board game form.
It looks insanely difficult but the rulebook is written in a step-by-step learning format walking you through the game rules as complexity is added to each new scenario. 
The figures are great, the tiles are nice.
I DID have a problem with some of the order tiles not being cut correctly and some slight tearing on about 1/4 of them.

Haven't played it.  Just bought it (split it with a friend) but very much excited to play. 

---  Played 2.  Not sure.  Sort of fun, but SO much going on.  I think that it will be a good game if we took the time to play it through the learning curve.  That said, the Set Up on this game is brutal.  Takes quite a long time.  

The game is super pretty though, you can tell they spared no expense to add as much detail as possible.

Great game, one of my all time favourites. Not a perfect 10 though because of it's complexity, it needs a standard gaming buddy and lots of free time so that sessions should be quite frequent. But it pays you back, infinite things to do and the same scenario never plays the same. Just excellent!

Okay, so what if the whole thing looks like a junkie made himself a Halloween costume? Or that my girlfriend's afraid of it? Or that SAGS takes about five days to set up? I don't care, I painted the minis and I'm keeping it.

UPDATE 3/1/13: Has not made it to the table once since I wrote my last comment. The game is mechanically brilliant, probably the best out-of-the-box tactical minis game I've played. But on second blush, atomizing the board into tiny, constitutive Tetris pieces was a mistake, and means I will always, always be too tired to set this bear up.

Third play rating 8

I have only played the intro scenario and I like what I see. I am hopeful that the rest of the rules will be as solid as the intro.

Should the complete rules hold up and add real substance to the basics then this game will surely rise in its rating for me.

Now that I have read all the rules and played the first two scenarios...this game is simply fantastic. I expect the rating to climb further upon further play.

The layers of tactical depth...the feel of watching a story unfold...and the ruled book is awesome.

I hope to find a few more willing opponents so the chances for table time goes up.

Hm. I skipped right to the tutorial with guns, and I'm not 100% certain about my rating. It's good, and it's got some interesting ideas, but I really don't like the programmed instruction format. I am still very eager to try the game in all its glory, with searching et al in the auto-scenario generator.
[EDIT] Oh, man, once you get to searching the game kicks in hard. Interesting decisions that differentiate it from its ilk. Sadly, the cast is so small, and attacks so reliably ineffectual, that it just isn't to my taste when compared to Claustrophobia, Space Hulk, et al. On the verge of utter brilliance. The incredibly long setup time doesn't help.

A bit fiddly to set up, but great fun once you do. I don't see it hitting the table too often, as it's not really the kind of game everyone in my group likes, but I'm certainly looking forward to playing more. SI wanted one squad based combat game and this silly sci-fi theme appealed to me. The components are great, while the way the rules are slowly revealed through increasingly complex scenarios is very well handled.

RATING: 10
A very enjoyable game with a lot of tactical subtlety and moments of pure fun. It is a very complete system that feels as if they included an expansion with the base game. The rules themselves follow common sense and are easy to remember yet lead to nail biting decisions. A very clever and immersive game.

Update: After playing all the scenarios and SAGs twice I have upgraded this to a 10, only my second game with that score. It really is a great game we love to play. So many options and decisions that nothing seems forced yet at the same time they are all intuitive. The rules are concise and easy to reference yet with plenty of examples and the storage tray provided should be industry standard. The models look great and each item of equipment has a potentially big impact on the game if used wisely. Each game tells its own story and even when winning you know you could have played better. A sign of a great game.

This is my gaming obsession at the moment. Been stalking it for almost a year. Played the first scenario and was good, but really it just felt like a tease of what to come. I just need a good gaming partner.

Edit: After playing through many of the scenarios (by myself) I can safely say that this game is completely amazing. I've only made it to scenario 4, and even by just playing by myself I think this game might be my favourite game. Some of the stories I got from that session will be thought of with warm regard everytime I think of board games. I even found a gaming partner as nerdy as I am. We both had a blast on the first scenario, which wets my mouth for the future. Recently I've been thinking of quitting the board game industry as a whole, mainly due to lack of people to play with as well as the cost of the hobby. However, after playing this masterpiece, it's given me enough hope that I want to stay with the hobby. This game very well may have saved my boardgaming career. 
It's also an absolutely incredible game.

This is a failed mashup of a tactical combat sim with creative but bizarre Euro-style mechanisms: puzzling out how to make the most of your blind draw of activation tokens; bidding command points to resolve interrupts; double-sided item cards with elaborate search-the-deck rules; and more. I can tolerate the graphic design choices in general, but even when you KNOW the walls are hard to distinguish from the doorways, you'll miss one somewhere and make a tactical blunder. I so wanted to like this game. If you want your tactical combat games to make sense, avoid this one, or be prepared to house rule it into oblivion.

I am in love with this game. I did not know games were capable of doing things that this can do. It is incredible. So many possibilities, choices, mechanics. Practically infinite replayability. Astounding.

RATING: 8
Hmmm this looks pretty cool... Characters and items remind me of DOA actually: 

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/770183/earth-reborn

The game sounds good too so far. 

-------

EDIT - HOLY CRAP! ALOT of work went into this game and it really shows. Yeah the rulebook is BIG and daunting and there are lots of icons everywhere, it really is a little too busy for even me but holy cow its still pretty f'ing cool.

Take Duel of Ages and marry it with something like Mutant Chronicles and you come pretty close to ER. Of course this is a fantastic marriage for a BIG bunch of people IF you like and want some extra detail put in for realism. If you really like the simplicity of something like Claustophobia and Space Hulk and don't want a steep learning curve you might want to pass this up, otherwise don't!

This is my very initial rating which I'm basing on just the first scenario BUT also on what I know about the entire system which as I mention has many shades of DOA in it with many other things added on like the Missions and such, game has big potential and is very ambitious. (Rating for just scenario 1 might only be a 7 or a bit less. Game has potential for a 9 or 10 and my top 10, its that cool). Really strong theme, really cool items, and so far play was okay but very basic (as it intended in Mission 1 just to learn), I really won't be able to fully comment on mechanics and the full game until I play further scenarios which introduce more of the rules. 

Components are really nice and a bargain for the online price. Replay value should be through the roof with just the base game which is another awesome feature here. The only 'potential' knock is setup time and a steeper learning curve depending on what your looking for (most games like this are TOO simple for me, not sure if this went too far the other way...) and I do wonder if all the detail with be worth it and really add to the game in the end or will it just be an overly detailed tactical minis game (meaning it will still be too light and then the detail wont be worth it). I also wonder if I really need this while owning DOA, my shelf space is REALLY tight at this point and it will scratch the same itch, not to mention DOA is still my top dog (which is why my interest is so high here too)

This game has opened up my eyes to the genius of the designer.  I've played the first 4 scenarios, and in my book, ER provides the most bang for buck of all the games I've played.

Given the occasional steep discount this game sells for, anyone even remotely interested should pick it up and play it.  It's a steal even at full price.

May this be the perfect game?

Obviously not, the perfect game does not exist, but damn, did this game try. Innovative gameplay, infinite replayability, stunning amount and quality of components, what more to ask? In fact, I can only see some tiny flaws in this superlative game:

-Painted minis would have been better (since I don't paint)
-The walls are too dark and blend with the floor; that may be the biggest gameplay problem this game has.
-The color choices on the cards and player screens are off-putting.
-Why isn't there an expansion already out!!

So why am I not rating it a "10"? Well, sadly, miniature tactical combat games are not really my cup of tea. Still, I'm having unholy amounts of fun with this one.

There's a great game in the box, and a lot of rules to explore.  Well done for putting these in the base game, rather than holding them back for an expansion.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (June 2011)

I needed to play this badly, after all Dungeon Twister is my favorite game and I wanted to play the last game designed by Christophe Boelinger. I´m glad I did. The bits are gorgeous and the game has a lot of them, miniatures, cards and map tiles all top quality. The game is very complex, the rules are easy to learn due to the fact that you are introduced to them by stages but it has a steep learning curve, as in Dungeon Twister experience matters A LOT!

The only down for me is the very looong setup time, in my second game we took more time building the map than playing the game :D. I really wish that the map tiles were numbered a la Gears of War, this would simplify the map building considerably.

For me this is a 2 player game, more than that and the downtime can be more than I´m willing to endure, but I need to try it at least once its multiplayer mode.

It shows a lot of work has gone into the game, I love all the details and I have played only twice. Kudos Mr. Boelinger, I believe this game will continue to raise in my ratings and I would to play it again.

I want to play this game a lot more, but the fact that it is a medium-heavy 2 player game doesn’t make it easy to get to the table. I need to find a partner to deeply explore this game. I’m downgrading its rating because nowadays I’m much more harsh with my ratings, still I think this is a great game, but a 9.0 rating seems a little excessive. Still I love it and plan to buy it in the future. 

For now, I won’t say no to a game of Earth Reborn (furthermore if my opponent sets up the game :devil:).

One of 2010 favorites.

Hands down one of my favorite games of my collection. Everything about this game has been so well thought out by its designer Chris; the rules, the scenarios that teach you the rules progressively, the components, the box and insert.. it really goes to show you that he took the time to really think it out, and the final product shows that.

To illustrate how easy this is to teach; I played the first scenario with my wife, and she quite enjoyed herself. The rules took about 15 minutes and the scenario itself about 40 minutes. She isn't opposed to playing it again with me. Granted, it will take both of us some time to learn the whole game, but the design for teaching it via the scenarios is outstanding.

For some more thoughts on this whole process, check out my session report here:

This is a ingenious board game creation, all in all! What a deep and complex with exceptionally steep and  long learning curve, but the pain of learning how to play it is finally rewarded with great sense of satisfaction of playing a well-thought, high quality board game that comes with lots of heart in it. The game system is surprisingly smooth for such as complex game and it's true that the game gives players multiple ways to deal with every situation and mission. There is no one game that plays the same..this is the fact. My final verdict is: Earth Rebron is a one of a kind type of board game that every gamer should at least try it at least one time. Wonderful and superb board game! The reasons for it not getting a 10/10 is because it's a long game, not easy for teaching new gamers, and takes a relatively long time (3-4 hours per game) to complete a session.

RATING: 9
I can see why this game has quite low points, few have patience to learn the mechanics and teach them to opponent. This game has clever rules, and very well made components. Its exciting, and scenarios have variation. The first three scenarios are pretty boring, but they teach the core mechanics of the game. Then, nearly every scenario brings more mechanics and items, so the game eventually gets better and better. Best situation is, that you have some friend, who`s willing to learn the game with you and you both go and play through the scenarios. If you like miniature games and skirmish scenarios, this might be just for you. In my opinion this is a hidden gem game. This isn`t some random game to bring on table on boardgame meetings, but for dedicated friends this might be it :)

Downside: Very long setup time with no way to really shorten it, horrendous art design - too much going on for your eyes to focus on the parts of the board, the instructions are relatively well laid out, but again, the art design makes the instructions and cards bordering on painful to look at.

Been a long while since I have had my table top war game itch scratched. This is a board game pretending to be a table top war game, and with some simple streamlined rules, a wide variety of individualised stat lines and lots of chrome and options, this game fills an interesting niche.
For me it sits in between a board game and a table top war game - and actually manages to pull it off really well. Focused on the micro details of each character's unique attributes the game has a low on map head count, so that it's something of a man to man skirmish simulator.
Everything you need is in the box. And everything can be played on your average table top. And yet you can get that almost table top mini war gaming feel from it.

Cool stuff. Begs for expansions, home brews and upscaling into monster fights.

Ameritrash perfection. 

Played

Scenario 2 x 2
Scenario 3 x 2
Scenaro 5 x 1

A great game, lots of fun and options. Scenario 5 offered a large step up in complexity as to search effectively you need to be familiar with the deck of equipment. All of the characters ips lines were also included and was a little overwhelming. Still, looking forward to cracking this one out again soon and getting to the 'real game' of the scenario generator with all of the rules.

RATING: 6
After playing scenarios 1 & 3, Earth Reborn worked but did not excite.  I'm not a big fan of dice pools for man to man games as they tend to weight outlier results more heavily than I would like and, sure enough, the problem is here as well, where a streaky, against the odds roll can have a big impact on play (nothing like 3-4 critical hits in one roll to flip a character) while the 'typical' roll often does nothing at all.  

The order tile system worked alright, but I wasn't an enormous fan of having to allocate command points between both characters and bidding for duels, especially when one side tended to rapidly accumulate a large CP advantage.  Also, why does having character A attempt more tasks mean character B sits still and does nothing?  

Close combat felt very unsatisfying and short on results.  Guns were somewhat better but these characters are  incredibly wretched shots - they can barely hit anything over 10' away.  Movement rates are all over the place, with the NORAD characters being able to cover enormous distances (30+ squares) in a turn.  Overall, the game is playable, but you can see why the designer felt it best to measure out the experience in small doses.

Might revise my rating if the later scenarios reveal hidden depths, but for now I would rather pull most of the other man to man games in my collection off the shelf in ER's place.  Liked it more than Tannhauser 2.0 for what it's worth.

A truly great game that will surely become a classic in years to come. I really can't think of a game with so many options and decisions available. You can blow up walls and walk through them. Knock down doors, plant mines and bombs. Raise the dead and send them out to fight, Shoot the enemy with hand guns or blow em away with a bazooka. Rip through them in hand to hand. Launch missiles, spy on the enemy, torture the enemy or just kill the enemy. Operate a huge mech, capture a huge mech and turn it on your enemies and so much more.

That being said there are a few flaws. Shooting seems to almost always be a close range thing because it's hard (depending on the weapon and players ability) to get the range so you don't want to chance the miss and so you get as close as possible.

Also Vasquez can charm Frankeinstien and turn him against the salemite player. It's a cool idea but Frank is one of the salemites hardest hitters and to have him turn against you is harsh. She should have been able to charm one of the weaker characters. Still, an awesome game.

This is a game that I wanted to be so much more than it really is.  I have now played 3 or 4 games and we are slowly including more and more rules but it is taking forever to get there.  The setup can take longer than the gameplay.  I was initially extremely impressed with the components but have since cooled on them; the figures are warping at the bases and their is just no good way to organize the tiles.  The insert was completely worthless.  I think this game may finally reach it's true potential if two of us were able to learn the whole rulebook and get to the later scenarios but this won't happen.  Just too many games and too little time.

RATING: 9
Have yet to even reach the full rules and play through all 9 scenarios, yet this game is quite clearly already a 10 in my book.

*Edit* I recently have tentatively dropped this game to a 9.  The game's biggest "problem" in my view is the fact that you have to find another "dedicated" player or group of players to play it with.  Otherwise you end up constantly re-playing the learning scenarios with new people, which can grow a bit stale.  I suppose you could throw some die-hard gamers into the deep-end of the pool with the full ruleset, but it would be a lot to absorb all at once.  Still a great game to play, just wish it was a little easier to get people to learn the rules and play it.

I've played this game more than ten times and have yet to play with all the rules in place, much less set up a game of SAGS. However, this is a game for the ages. It has some flaws, but the focus on narrative and the quirky edge to the theme really enhance the game in unexpected ways. The mechanics at heart are quite simple: using a limited pool of little chits make your figures do stuff and using the same chits to add dice to conduct combat or launch some missiles.  However, the game can be frustrating to set up, then very frustrating to teach, then supremely frustrating to see the dice hate you. Still, despite the frustration, the game is well worth playing repeatedly, especially if you're into skirmish games with miniatures. It's absurdly brilliant in many ways and definitely at the top of the class for a miniatures skirmish game.

RATING: 3
The extremely busy graphical design is what turns me most away from the game.  The character cards are also crazy busy.  The rules are very dense for a game system that's just ok yet near to impossible to find opponents for.  At this point I'd much rather invest my time and money into a game that's  widely played and supported like Imperial Assault.  I would rate the game slightly higher from a design standpoint but my rating follows BGG's recommendation in regards to my desire to play it.

REPLACED BY:  Imperial Assault.

Thinking about this because of someone's "it's the squad mode from X-com!" comment.

Update: based on Sphere's comment [article=6823949]here[/article], daveboy's [thread=654849]review[/thread] saying X-COM was his favorite skirmish game [i]until[/i] this, and mistermarino's personal assurance that he'll forgive me for making him play a Euro at BGG.CON 2010 if I don't love this, [b]I am getting this game.[/b]

Update: after 9 games--just the first three scenarios--there's a lot I really like in this game, and a ton of stuff I haven't even gotten to yet.  Although the graphic design is initially kind of overwhelming, the programmed instruction means you only have to learn a bit of the character cards at a time, and it doesn't take long to get to the point where the symbols are like Race for the Galaxy, where you can look at a new card and know what it does without having to read the rules.

After 500 years, two factions emerge from their underground cities into a new world, an Earth reborn from nuclear disaster.12 highly detailed miniatures represent the two factions which are:NORAD: military in thinking and origins. Scientists, engineers, add to their strength.SALEMITES: occultists working with cadavers, bringing the dead to life.Soon after emerging, these two factions meet - and it is determined that they cannot live together in peace.Earth Reborn offers nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, and escort through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more. Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial. There are core rules to start the game, and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules.The game also contains the innovative S.A.G.S. (Scenario Auto Generating System), where 2-4 players can make their own maps and mission objectives for near infinite replayability!

An awesome game where a story unfolds before your eyes as you play it. The mechanics are excellent especially the character order system.

* About the rulebook and the rules: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/603832/amazingly-streamlined-and-rich-dont-fear-the-44-pa

* Components
+ Lots of bits, for the price (52 €, compared to almost 40 € for Dominion).
+ The rulebook looks a little bit intimidating (44 pages!) and garish.  The rulebook is segmented in multiple sections, with clearly identified paragraphs.  That should make rule look up nice and easy.
- The card board tokens can be somewhat misaligned.  This does not seem to be problematic, though.  They are also sometimes a little hard to punch, and relatively thick cardboard sometimes remains at the attachment points (Space Hulk 3rd ed., and Conflict of Heroes: AtB are better, in that respect).  I had one door that had partially fresh glue on it: it stuck on another door, which damaged the drawing.  Nothing that prevents playing the game in the best conditions.

* The game play
+ Dripping with theme (even more than Space Hulk!): the number of equipments and objects is staggering; they all have specific "powers".  The dozen characters also have their own specific powers.  Not tested: The result is that the game feels extremely thematic, almost like an RPG: you can do so many things, in a game.
+ Not yet tested: The number of options is refreshing, compared to other miniature games like Space Hulk, Claustrophobia, LotR: TMG, or Heroscape.
+ Not tested: Being able to play with 3/4 players is a plus, compared to Space Hulk's official scenarios, and to most Claustrophobia scenarios.
- 1st scenario: good for learning, not a real game: 15 minutes of setup, 15 minutes of rules, 30 minutes of game, but not such a great experience (nothing compared to the richness of my first Race for the Galaxy).  The whole game, however, created a nice little story (I did make my figures act :) ), which not so many games succeed in doing.
+ 2nd, 3rd scenario: mistakes can be paid dearly, like in Space Hulk, but with more flexibility, as the terrain is more open, and the characters more distinct. FM finds that it is "too much like a PC game", but while the action is indeed quite cinematic, in the 3rd scenario, we plaid an action that would take a few minutes in real life in maybe an hour, where we could *think* and plan, and exercise our brains. A PC game of the genre does not offer the same brain jog (just the cinematic action, and loads of it).

This is the game.

I love sandbox-y game systems.  Magic Realm and Merchant & Marauders are great sandbox adventure games.  Fast Food Magnate is a great sandbox economic game.  Earth Reborn is a sandbox tactical combat game.

Everything you could want to do is doable.  Flirt.  Poop.  Destroy vegetation.  Destroy a wall.  Destroy a toilet.  Hack a laptop.  Recover for the U.S. Constitution.  Capture a walking mech and pilot it yourself.  Inject zombie fluid into corpses.  Jam radio frequencies.  Launch missiles.  Torture enemies.

And that's not including the basics of the game, which include incredible intuitive close combat and gun combat, a clever multi-purpose order system, and a thematic search system to find more gear.

It's attractive, it's easy to learn, and it's hilariously pulpy.  This is the game.

Played a few times.

Awesome components and replay value.  Sold after a few plays simply due to frustration over setup times, which probably would have improved with additional component familiarity.  Also, if the tiles were numbered, I would likely still own the title.  Probably will regret this sale, but I won't miss the frustrating setup/breakdown.    Also of note is the minimal number of miniatures per side and how much more they would appeal if they were painted - they come primed, in fairly similar colors (particularly in low light conditions).  

Would happily play again.  Likely not a future re-purchase, as I expect Sedition Wars will fulfill this role in my collection.

Earth Reborn is a very cool tactical miniatures game, with high quality components and solid mechanics. The reason I valued this game at an 8 as opposed to higher is due to the low amount of playable scenarios (9), several of which are so basic and tutorial-esque in nature as to deter me from replaying them.

The create your own scenario guidelines also seem lazy to me, and the game does not really support 3-4 players very well.

If you have a good friend who doesn't mind going start to finish with you through all of the scenarios, it will certainly be a tactical delight. But once you complete all of the pre-built scenarios, the game starts to steadily decline in replay value.

a perfectly designed game, with A LOT of choices. once you really get a grasp on all the mechanics, especially combined actions, this game gets incredibly tactical.

Gameplay:
+ brilliantly designed mechanics, with no exceptions to the rules or any in-game text
+ extremely tactical (I especially enjoy combined actions)
+ an enormous amount of possible actions and choices
+ completely randomized scenarios, with randomized mission objectives and map set up each game; thus unlimited replayability

- can be very, very long
- only a handful of characters per faction

Components:
+ high quality components
+ nicely sculpted miniatures
+ A LOT of stuff
+ nice artwork on cards and map tiles
+ a perfect insert allows you to store and sort everything in the box

- even though the game mechanics for hallway map tiles does not vary, the artwork does, which can be confusing. there are too many different looking hallways.

I traded my Runewars for this, and I do not regret it. The production values are top notch, and though it is overproduced, there is a use for every chit.  The figures beg to be painted, and though I have no artistic skill,  I would one day like to paint my figures.  The scenarios ease you into the rules, with each scenario building on the last, and easing you into the game.  The story and theme of an occult zombie apocalypse is fun and interesting.  I was never a tactical miniatures fan but this is an easy way to get into the genre Combat and movement are intuitive.  Overall great game.  Probably needs a new scenario booklet and more figures and tiles  at some point to keep the game fresh.

It took me two hours to punch all the components and put them back in the box (using a map I found online -- no joke), and the game takes quite a while to set up, but the payoff is an amazing skirmish wargame that plays like a dream.

Once the tiles are in place, the board is seamless and looks awesome. The order system, the activations, and the command point mechanic are all superb.

The rules are clear, with great examples and diagrams, and the game is easy to teach. I love the programmed learning element, too.

The end product is fun to play -- a lot of fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously (definitely a problem with some wargames), yet serious effort went into making this a great game in an amazing package.

It's gorgeous, it's easy to learn, it's easy to teach, it comes with tons of scenarios, and it includes everything you need to make more. I really couldn't ask for much more in a wargame.

---

The catch is that this is a fairly involved game, and while the learn-in-steps method is well done, it means you need a consistent opponent willing to learn with you. I don't have one at the moment, so this never hits the table.

A year or two later, sold it.

One of those addictive games for sure.  Takes a long time to setup, but that will improve with time no doubt.  The system is slick and runs well - as lots have said - great (best) skirmish system around.  The programmed instruction worked since the rules are complete each time you stop.  The way this was accomplished was a 'modular' rules system that reminds me of the optional rules setup of TI3.  Quality components, highly replayable, great theme, clear system - a classic in the making.

Of course, I want more characters already!  It has enough, but I want more!  More of everything will be nice when an expansion comes along - I am sure there will be one.

Three player has issue in the SAGS system.  This is really best as 2-player anyhow.

I'm rating this game very soon, only after playing intro mission, so the rating can possibly change. However two point are outstanding already. + is that the possibilities in this game looks as infinitive. - the building of the board is really painful and problematic, mainly if you build it for 40 minutes and then end the game in 15 minutes :). But still, for that price, lot of toys to enjoy. Want to play more.

RATING: 7
Only gotten up to scenario 6 so far, so I feel like I shouldn't give a rating until I reach the full game.

What I like:
- At least in the later scenarios, the objectives are not all about destroying the other side.  I like how you get VP for accomplishing various tasks.
- The scenarios ease you into the rules and concepts slowly
- Lots of details for everything makes things more realistic.  That also means lots of little rules to remember, but most of it makes intuitive sense.
- Characters generally have more defense than in other games I've played, so they're a little harder to kill off and not as expendable.

What I don't like:
- Long setup
- Lots of rules to learn the full game
- Some of the earlier scenarios seem unbalanced, but that's ok since the point is to teach the basics.
- Luck in drawing the order tiles. Sometimes you really need a certain action for the next round and you might have to spend some points in the previous round to find the exact order tile.
- Radio scrambling can screw up your plans pretty bad
- Still not really a fan of dice-based combat.  I seem to have horrible luck with dice and I sometimes I feel like I just spent an hour accomplishing nothing.

Judged by the rules alone I was afraid that it wants to be innovative at all cost, just for the sake of being innovative. 
Playing it however is a whole different matter. Once you get over the basic mechanics and try it in practice, everything gets real and feels natural. The complex but surprisingly intuitive ruleset supported by a powerful background-story results in much more than a tactical miniature dice-roller. It's rather like a compelling adventure, rich in details.

Absolutely, hands down, without doubt the finest game I've played in the last couple of years!

Every game is filled with nail-biting tension, critical decisions and is simply a blast.  

When you're down to your last character and the whole game revolves around that last crucial dice roll...what a rush!  

The rules are NOWHERE NEAR as overwhelming as you might think..yes, the rulebook is a beast, but play from the start and the game builds easily from just basically  movement and punch in the first scenario, then just steadily ups the options available. 

Play this game. Do it. Do it now!

This rating is based on the game after just three plays. Had a blast and think this may be the ultimate 2 player battle. So far the first scenario was a basic game that had lots of flavor and fun in a quick 2 player skirmish that came down to the wire. Look forward to seeing what the new rules add. Love the fact that the rules are layered so you can learn as you go to. Wish more boardgames did that.

RATING: 9
This is game is so much fun!  I enjoy the depth, and the amount of options you have on every turn (and I'm only up to scenario 3 so far!).  No two plays of any scenario are the same.  I also really like the campy, B-movie storyline that goes along with it.  The downside to the game is the long set-up time, play-time, and complexity.  There's only a few people that I could play this with, and only one other person I know that feels the same way about it that I do.  Which means that I went 3 months without playing it, even when I'm dying to.  Ah well.

I wish I could play this so much more often as it really is a great game. It's just so hard to get plays on 2 player games of this depth and length of play. It's not something that I can show someone and just play.

This game has a lot of interesting and innovative ideas, is fun to play and is dripping with theme. The iconography appears intimidating but in practice is less so than, say, Race for the Galaxy. I've played the intro scenario and the virus scenario and enjoyed them both.

The board is odd: kind of a pain to set up, but also very flexible for scenario design. But everything seems to work.

It's one of the few games in recent memory that genuinely seems fresh and unique. It could be even better than an 8, but I'm waiting to play it again to confirm. It could easily be a 9 or 10. It would probably be fair to call this an instant classic. For me, anyway.

Three plays, now, and going strong. I just need to figure out the searching, interacting, etc., to see how the full experience works.

I'm torn on this game. I think I had the same problem with this as with Dungeon Twister. There's combat, and I want to fight, but I can't because I don't have the right randomly drawn token. Then I want to attack, but I have to roll a targeting die, then look at my base colors to figure out an attack die, then defender colors and modifiers for a defense die, all before attacks are resolved. I think too much abstraction got mixed with my Ameritrash here, which is kind of a shame since production values are through the roof. Character card design is horrid with more symbols than Tom Lehman could figure out. But the tiles are awesome. Overall, if I want themey combat, I think I'd rather play Heroscape or Nexus Ops. Those games are fast and furious, and my focus is on the action rather than tiles with icons. At the end of the day, this feels more puzzle than fun and falls flat for me, which is sad because I wanted to like its sci-fi, apocalyptic theme and crazy characters. It kind of reminded me of Up Front, another game I desperately wanted to love, with a decent game system that tried to simulate too much, and ends up being a convoluted combination of too many mechanics and ideas.

This game is definitely working its way to be one of my favorites.

Okay, the girl next door butchered me while I was sitting on the toilet, in order to steal my magnetic card in the first scenario: how cool is that.

Update: 16th play was first time scenario 6 of the 2 player tutorial. This game deserves great admiration how it combines high detail with fluent game play and theme with strategical and tactical depth (fantasy flight can only dream about this). The tutorial works wonderful and ensures that learning the game is easy due to the step by step method. The only problem is that you need dedicated gaming buddies. I think you can teach this game to 3 players maximum using this tutorial(more when you play the 3-4 player web published scenarios) without getting bored of the first scenarios.

Update: third play with SAGS this game is awesome!!!

I have to say that although I think that Earth Reborn  is fun at the fairly basic level, I am otherwise disappointed. It looks good and the miniatures are awesome but  There is far too much to take in even with programmed instruction to take you through a learning curve. The theme is good if not terribly original, as post apocalyptic stuff including a couple of the obligatory zombies has been done relatively to death. Its a very ambitious game and perhaps too much of a good thing. The set up is difficult and too time consuming. The background, although interesting is no where as rich as the galaxies of the 40K universe. The mechanics are very bitty and when compared to the streamlined playability of the likes of Space Hulk   there is just no comparison. Yes, there are more free form options here but for me, its all too much. This one is only for the very dedicated who will stick with it.

My review right now is based on the first 2 scenarios:
This seems like a great game. Main downside is, that you have to have a dedicated partner to go through all scenarios and get the grasp of the game. Then you can play SAGS and have unlimited possibilities I guess.
But since my boyfriend is less motivated than me to play I might need to find another playing partner for this :(

Haven't played the full game yet, but from what I have already seen I can tell that this one just kicks ass!

EDIT:

Got through the first four scenarios and the game just keeps getting better and better. However, more rules and options mean lengthier playtime, so it's not as recommended as Space Hulk in terms of short evening meet-ups during the week. An amazing game nevertheless!

EDIT:

After a few more plays I have realized just how fiddly this game is. Only a handful of characters, but an overabundance of rules, plus the setup time is just absurd. It's difficult to get anyone to play simply because there are better and more intuitive tactical games.

Originally thought I didn't need this as I already had tactical games like Doom. But there's enough I've heard about this game to be really excited for it. The theme seems cool, the pieces look awesome and it sounds like another fun sci fi one.

It's just TOO complex. I'm not into tactical sci fi enough or would play it often enough that it would be worth the endevour of learning, teaching preparing, setting up and taking down this game. I like lighter tactical games and as a result, don't think this game fits my collection even though I'm sure it's amazing for those who want a truly deep sci fi tactical game. It's just too much for me for what I'm looking for in this genre.

Only played the first 3 scenarios so far, although I've read all the rules.

Earth Reborn doesn't seem to offer anything particularly new to miniature gaming but it doesn't shy from packing in detail.  Where as a lot of games these days go for simplicity, Earth Reborn is over-flowing with rules and options.  It hasn't left anything out for the sake of accessibility.  

Some of the mechanics are genius, most are nothing you haven't seen before and some are down right clunky!

You get a load of components in the box and it seems pretty good value for money.  The miniatures are very nice too.

The game comes with a series of scenarios that gradually introduce all of the different rules for the game.  Once you've got them down, the game has a funky system for generating random missions and set-ups.  

Unfortunately, as the game is so complicated the best way to teach it to a new player is to play through all of the scenarios.  I guess that's fine if you're planning on teaching it to one opponent, but it'll get annoying if you're going to try to teach this to multiple people.

Set up takes ages and is very fiddly.  No exaggeration - we took pretty much the same amount of time setting up scenario 2 as we did playing it (although the Salemite player did allow the NORAD player to win very easily in our game!).

Over all, looks interesting but requires a big investment in time to get the most out of it.

RATING: 8
The ULTIMATE shooter, but with a couple of problems. 

It seems there is nothing one can't do in this game, one can obviously even smash toilets for no reason at all! The SF/Horrer theme highly appeals to me. The bits are of very good quality. The artwork is fine, yet sometimes slightly unfunctional. 

But here are the problems: 
1.) Time for setup and cleanup. There are SO MANY pieces that it's sometimes hard to find particular ones among all the other stuff. Plano boxes, you say? Will the box accomodate them...?
2.) You need a persistent gaming partner who is willing to invest enough time for regular plays. It's too complex for a casual play. I don't believe 3 or 4 players would work here.

Awesome thematic game. It takes time to get used to the its mechanics, but once it begins to flow, you get one of the best tactical/narrative experience until now. And the box is packed with optional rules and stuff like tiles and figs : replayability seems almost infinite. Big value for the money. Downloadable content is the icing on the cake.

Ton of stuff, yet very intuitive. Only problem it has is that some of the scenarios provided in the scenario book are a bit dull. I mean that if it's the first time you are implementing search-order, be ready to search, search and search. Another problem with the scenarios is also that the objectives aren't hidden. Though as SAGS fixes all of these issues, they won't be enough to drop the rating. All in all, a great game.

RATING: 7
After working through the beginner scenarios, there appears to be too much downtime for my tastes where people quiver over the best use of their order tiles - who gets which one, in which order to use them, when to buy more. As each turn progresses, and it becomes clearer what you're going to do, it gets faster, but not by enough. Turns are otherwise quite simple as the base mechanics are pretty clean. There's obviously a whole world of detail to be uncovered as the game progresses, but I suspect the downtime issue will override the joy of exploring all the remaining stuff.

This one is for people who hate board games but love cardboard. A veritable orgy of confused mechanics and unnecessary components. It boasts of scenario customization, but features a minimal set of characters, most of which boring and tropey. The setting itself is the worst of kind of generic: classic concepts blatantly ripped off, infantilized and smashed together on a canvas of terrible writing. The miniature quality is bad, the artwork is worse. The rules are complicated for the sake of being complicated in some parts, but basic and unpolished in others.

RATING: 6
Pros:
+Dripping with theme.
+Fun backstory.
+TONS of content to filter and play through.
+Lots of finely crafted goodies (minis look great).
+Game doesn't seem to drag and has a fairly quick playtime.
+Slight amount of luck with the dice, but very strategic.
+Even the extremely basic game allows for a lot of cool things you can do to the board/players.
+Quality components.

Cons:
-Set up time...ugh.
-Putting away the game....ugh.
-Insert is a box with no description of how to put it away. You have to look online for an answer.
-Very hard to teach to new people, especially if you don't want to go through all the scenarios again.

My tentative rating for this is a 10. Further plays with all the rules in place may change my rating, but I'm pretty sure this is going to stay a 10.

So far an excellent scenario based tactical combat game. It's reminiscent of Fallout tactics, X-com, and Jagged Alliance computer games. If you enjoyed those you will probably enjoy this. Others have referenced that if you like space-hulk and Claustrophobia you will probably like this too.

It's an investment to learn everything and is best played with all the rules. Fortunately it comes with an excellent rule book and learning scenarios. 

The only down-side to this game is that it can take awhile to set up the learning scenarios. The standard way of playing the game can be faster though. 

edit: need a computer version of this game or a vassal version. Awesome game but hard to get to the table. 

Lowering this to a 9. Plays like a 10, but setup, complexity, and teachability is hurting the score for me now.

This game is a possible 10 with all the stuff and options you get in the box. The most complete game package ever.

This is the most interesting miniatures tactics game I've played yet. I love the way the character minis have different hit areas exposed depending which angle they are attacked from. The plot is also fun and interesting. The big downside is that this game has a long setup time with lots of fiddily scenery bits, and complicated rules. 

Additionally the scenarios are for 2 players, but random melee maps go to 4, which should be a great feature but it would have been better for a consistent player count so that rules could more easily learned.

There's a lot to like about this game. It borrows mechanics from a lot of other similar games, but the difference here is all that's included. As you make your way through the "training" missions, you'll soon realize the overwhelming amount of options at your disposal.

The learning curve is a bit high, just because it takes so much time to get into the meat of the game, but getting their is worth it. A really awesome game with a great community of gamers adding new content all the time.

This game f-in' rocks! Every scenario tells it's own unique story. This is like the boardgame version of all of those crazy actions movies I grew up with from the 80's/90's. The rulebook and iconography can look intimidating, but I've been able to explain all of the rules (through scenario 5) to a newbie in about 10 minutes. Generally speaking, all of the rules makes sense and just feels like the most intuitive way to accomplish a given task.

Easily the best miniatures game I've ever played.

Quite fun with mechanisms well implemented. I especially like the rules which allow to break all things. I disliked the running out of ammo rule (I think it should be checked from the first damage roll). Now the ammo is more like to end from a character who is sniping from the distance than from a character who is pouring it from point blank.

Also I think I still like Duel of Ages better.

After a few more plays decided to up the rating to 9.5 since the game is very enjoyable to play. I love games with depth and detail but even more so with rules that are laid out so well with very few questions that are readily available in the rulebook anyways just have to look for them.

This game is massive. From setup to rules to playtime but it's intriguing enough to keep at it. The rules are nicely set up to teach you slowly and systematically. Each new scenario introduces new rules and facets to the game. We're gonna keep at it and hopefully get over the learning curve.

I've only played scenario three, and I've played it only twice.

I like the system, but the game requires significant set-up time and too many materials.

Command tokens. Order tokens. Equipment cards. Two types of dice....

RATING: 5
ok so i like a lot of things about this game but i dislike more - it is WAY too complicated for its own good, the scenarios are poorly designed but i think the map elements are more to blame - too many games just come down to 1/2 choke points with ppl shooting or hitting each other in the face - ie just rolling dice till someone dies. which is true of other games but this one takes SO LONG cos of all the fiddling about with order tokens - the choices can be quite interesting but its all so fiddly and unsatisfying - shame cos i had v high hopes for this 

update: - tried the SAGS which does make things better but all above still apply - i might like the game if it was the same BUT with the fiddly order tokens removed but as it is it takes FOREVER and still comes down to a few dice rolls

BTW i think the scenarios are generally dull and unnecessary - if i was learning it anew or teaching it i would read the manual then play 1 scenario - prob 9 - then go straight onto the SAGS

RealTime = 4 hours

The closest one will get to a turn-based strategy game like X-com. Highly thematic. Although 3-4 player scenarios exist (available online) it's really a 2 player game out of the box or a 4 player game.

Limitations are that the manual terminology is counter to what most English speakers would expect with the terms "round" and "turn" being swapped.

Also there's a relatively long set-up time due to the tile and corridor design. An expansion would be welcome for this as well.

I've played the first two scenarios until yet and if I accept them to be scenarios just for teaching the rules, then I have patience with this game. On the other hand: preparing the scenario took us a long time, playing it let us speechless after 15 minutes ... within the first (!) round the game was finished. That was definetely an unsatisfying experience. I'm looking forward to playing more scenarios. There has to be more flesh in this monster-game ... and I hope there will be more!

EDIT: Well, I decided to give this game away. I gave it a second chance but it felt again not very good although the components and everything looks so great. Sorry, but this game was a bit flawed for me.

Pity personally i´m not a fan of shooting and beating around and that it´s such a difficult game.  Otherwise, if you enjoy this theme and are ready for patience, GET IT.

Finally played Earth Reborn after owning it for just over a year! We read through the rules and played through the 1st scenario. It was a very good introduction to the movement and basic mechanics of the game, and the tiles and cards and map elements definitely show how much more complexity is possible within the game, but I'm not sure how much deeper we're interested in exploring. I think we'll just leave it on the shelf and see if we are in the mood for it sometime soon!

It's good - it's pretty, and it's fun. But it lacks that special somthing that I look for in this type of game. I think the lack of variety dosen't help - the fact I'll be playing with the same characters every battle kind of custs one of the major strategic elements in this type of game out - the building of a team that works well together. 

This is compounded by the fact that many of the characeters seem to rely on other characters being present or not to use their full ability. In a build-your-own army game, this would be a great balancing factor - do you take X when Y would render him useless? In a game with fixed sides, it feels like it basically controls your play.

Way too much simulation, not enough fun. Really reminds me on the difference between some RPG systems back in the day, where one branch went down the Rolemaster route, trying to simulate everything it could. Yes it might be realistic, but it's not fun and doesn't add any interesting decisions.
This is something I might enjoy playing on the computer (Fallout Tactics?), but not face to face with a friend.

RATING: 7
The rulebook made me want to cry (in addition to burning my eyes). Game setup made me cry again. As for the game itself, I appreciate the level of detail that went in, but I'm getting too hung up on the layered rule complexity right now. De-prioritizing this (over more streamlined fare like Gears of War and Space Hulk) until I have the time and opponent to play this over and over consecutively to internalize the rules.

Some elements felt weird to me, like the hand of order tiles you manage, and the requirement to activate everybody once before activating somebody again. Artificial gamey constraints like these are jarring after you go through so much effort to simulate things. On a similar note, I've always found it hard to wrap my head around games where your dudes can move across half the entire map given the right circumstance.

Having interrupts be expensive is a nice touch (all other games I've played let you interrupt freely as long as you saved the APs).

Like Dungeon Twister 2, the game hand-holds you through the boring 'training scenarios' to get to the full, standard experience. Wonder if I should just drink from the hose some day.

1st play, as with all wargames, was uneven. I'll bump it a point up since this reminds me of Jagged Alliance, which I can't believe I forgot about. Thanks to Earth Reborn for dredging up those memories of late nights in my childhood clicking away at the computer.

RATING: 9.5
After several plays this game seems to be quite luck based, with all the die rolls for target / attack / defend / search / interact and the randomness of the order tile draw. Spending a huge amount of command points for nothing, by doing several rolls with a fistful of dice but rolling not enough hits is really frustrating, especially if that happens again and again. Fortunately, most of the luck factors are mitigable.

Nevertheless this is an incredibly well designed game with intense and engaging gameplay. This might as well be the best 2-player tactical miniatures board game ever designed. Only the long setup time is keeping this from a 10 rating.

Very complex, and setup can take awhile even with an organized box, but the strategies and tactics are very interesting.  Sometimes the random order draws can be frustrating when you really need to do something.

Hopefully will be able to get through the scenarios to start doing the scenario generator rules, which I imagine could add a lot more replayability.  The only problem with the scenarios is they are built to teach the rules, and so except for the last one you aren't really using everything.

Legegyszerűbben úgy foglalhatnám össze, hogy Doom kicsit jobban kidolgozva és még szebben megvalósítva. Nem az én típusom az ilyen amerikai játék, de ez tényleg nagyon jól ki van dolgozva. Egy-egy szerepkártya nagyon jó ikonozású, már egy játék után is teljesen érthető. Összesen kétfajta kocka van a játékban, egy harcra egy a kutatásokra. Nagyon jól és nem túl bonyolultan van kidolgozva a harcrendszer. Közel- és távharc, teljesen egyértelmű módon megalkotva. Nagyon jól kitalált az akciópontfelhasználási mechanizmus. Szép a kivitelezés, jók a karakterek. Szóval egy nagyon jól kidolgozott játék az Earth Reborn. Stílusában eddig a legjobb, amivel játszottam. Talán, amit hibának lehet felhozni, hogy igazából kétszemélyes. Hárman nem a legjobban működik, négyen még talán jó lehet.

Very interesting, if somewhat complex, post-apocalyptic tactical combat, that takes some play to be fully appreciated. Backstory is silly, set-up demanding and lengthy.

RATING: 8
Still playing with the stripped down rules (played first 3 tutorial Scenarios) but after the third one this game is really starting to come together. Was kinda boring at first, but adding Interruption duels and Shooting has made all of the difference.

I think if I teach this game in the future I'll start with up to Scenario 3 rules by default; the tutorial scenario system is really cool in that it lets you learn the game in pieces, but for gamers starting with up to Scenario 3 rules is definitely not too much to chew and is much more interesting. Hell, once I'm done with the scenarios, if I'm playing with a REAL REAL gamer, I'll probably just teach all the rules.

Opinion of this likely to continue going up as more rules are introduced

[b]P.S.[/b] This game's cards and board are really, really, ugly... and I don't think it's just because of the dark depressing theme. That I'm OK with in many many other games. But I think it was designed with a serious lack of sense of style... everything is an absolute eyesore.

[hr]
The more rules the better. You can do anything in Earth Reborn. This is pretty much the quintessential "Ameritrash" experience as far as I'm concerned, and feels like an evolution of the slew of fun tactical fare that was released in the 90s. And I haven't even made it to SAGS yet... The downside is that the sheer complexity of the full system is just going to mean that this game is inaccessible for 90% of people. Also worth talking about is the setup time (20 minutes if one person doing the work, IMO), but if you have the time to delve into the system and learn the rules, then after you get past the first few "meh" scenarios and on to the real meat which takes actual time to play the setup time becomes increasingly justified. Rating raised.

Pretty straightforward miniatures game with a ton of elements to learn about.  It excels in the field of depth and variety.  The game has a substantial learning curve, but the scenarios parse out the rules helpfully.  

My only MAJOR concern is the excessive set-up time.  Besides that I'm stoked to get this on the table again.

Incredible game.  I am in love with every facet of it.  The theme, the story, the characters.  Even the story between the characters is interesting and draws you right in to the universe in a way that other games have failed to do. (Android)

Many scenarios, a ton of depth with endless equipment and randomized maps, intense game play with really well explained rules that are intuitive when executed...what more can you ask for?

I've heard people say that if you like video games, you'll like Earth Reborn.

What an epic and awesome game this is!! :D The rules are intuitive and the modular way in which you learn them are very well thougth out :D 

I'm a big fan of Space Hulk and while I really love the alien vs. marine battling in the claustrophibic hallways of giant hulks of spacecraft theme, the tactical possibilities in Earth Reborn really outshines the competition ;)

The creators deserve a lot of respect for making this ingenious game come to life! Thanks guys :D

Now all I wish for are an expansion with more characters and miniatures!

After 500 years, two factions emerge from their underground cities into a new world, an Earth reborn from nuclear disaster.

Soon after emerging, these two factions meet - and it is determined that they cannot live together in peace.

Nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, and escort through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more. Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial. There are core rules to start the game, and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules.

Similar to Runewars (different theme). To play ER further than the tutorial, you need a consistent opponent (like Descent). ER works well with 2 players, Runewars works better with more than 2.

RATING: 7.5
A really solid skirmish game, particularly for two players. There's definitely a chess-like element to it, as positioning your people is very important. I really like the order mechanic by assigning tiles to your people. Really the only downside on this is that I'm not sure that I'm into long, complex two-player skirmish combat games, which probably limits the height of this rating, but I do think that this game is very well done. Finally, the bits are pretty damn impressive, especially the minis. It does help to paint them, but they certainly add to the experience.

UPDATE: This is best as a two-player game; we played it as a four-player and it just didn't seem to work all that well that way.

Setup is a nightmare. The game itself is like a grown up Last Night on Earth. I enjoyed the story behind it, and the scenario-based system makes sense by easing players into the complexity. Obviously a lot of love went into the design. I'm just not sure the setup is worthwhile. Justly adored, Earth Reborn is the kind of game I wish I could have played when I was younger when I had the time and the tolerance for the formidable time investment. I might have loved the game.

Most games that enter my collection need to fit into at least 2 out of 3 of the following criteria:
1) I enjoy it
2) My wife will play it
3) Something suited to playing at board game group

After 2 plays, it was too soon to say if no.1 was a possibility but it wasn't an immediate hit. Numbers 2 and 3 could not be fulfilled by this game so it has left my collection rather quickly.

I can't give this a rating but will give a warning that if you're thinking about getting this game, do your research and know what you're getting into. I'm sure many will love this game, but I don't think everyone will.

A really good game with a high entertainment factor and some VERY intelligent approaches and game mechanics. They look complicated in the beginning but as soon as you actually play them, they get very intuitive and make you smile. BUT: it can definitely not replace Space Hulk or push it from its throne! While you´ve got a lot more freedom in ER (it´s almost like in a video game!), the sheer simplicity and brilliance of SH can not be matched, as intended by the designer.

I've only played the first scenario so I don't have a lot to go on yet, but it is immensely obvious that this is a solid game.  I am a sucker for miniature skirmish games and this is one of the best to come around in a while.  The order tile mechanic limits your options but it is those limits that make the game engaging.  Having these random order tiles creates a "fog of skirmish" that is pretty exiting.  Normally in this type of game you can calculate exactly where each model can go and what it can do, how well it can shoot, the random order tiles bring the unknown back into the equation.  And it does this better than any game so far.

Earth Reborn is a remarkable game. I don't think I've ever seen man-to-man (zombie/woman/whatever) combat modeled this successfully in any previous game, regardless of genre. The game is extremely detailed, but everything hangs together seamlessly.

Programmed instruction scenarios allow you to learn and assimilate the rules in stages, and have fun while you do so. The rules are incredible - I can't remember ever seeing a new system with this much depth and detail that had so little errata in the first edition. The examples of play are superbly done.

The graphical information system supports the learning process, and here too everything hangs together, from the cards to the board to the player screens. Throw in a ton of components, very well modedled figures, a scenario generation system, and a website with everything from graphic editing tools for custom scenario generation to a complete set of 3-4 player scenarios for people who'd rather step through the programmed instruction learning process with more than 2 players.

This is a game of rare quality. Highly recommended.

Earth Reborn never got the attention it deserved.  The best Skirmish game and almost a role-playing experience.  It has two flaws.  The map set up takes too long.  The map is very pretty, but quite dark and it can be difficult to see.  You need to play it with a dedicated partner and play it often enough to go through the learning scenarios without forgetting the rules.  As such it is a commitment from two people, but it rewards that experience.

2011-1-24 Heureka, this is really SOMETHING! ..and I don't want to play anything skirmish/RPG/tactic but this .. LOVE IT!! ..finally! The Game that satisfies far beyond any gamers' wild action dreams (mine@least) in a word and deed! 
Unbelievable, it makes me think/feel like experiencing a *part* of some great fractal action metastructure (w/ luck,math&bluff) in a form of  interactive cinematic 'manifestation', thrillers right on the board in front of you and me, us in a charge there! [.just to mind, sags makes it powered by infinity:-] 
Depressive is only that one can never go through of *all* possible beautiful action situations and exciting over-smarting moments in a whole gaming life ..Pray4exp!)

(4Chris:big respect and thank you! changed my perspective of modern gaming. yours (and Zev's) courage to go out with originality and non-triviality is inspiring ..never scant on this!)

2012-07-25 E: after 50-60 plays, from all 2/multi tutorials till several SAGS variations (each play was totally unique drama, it doesn't feel repetitive at all, level of rules doesn't matter!) I wish I could rate 12 out of 10.. 11 can't be enough! 
NOTHING compares, nothing comes even close..(there are dziloins other shallow games crowds know well, but one ER)
This piece requires certain gaming priorities, devotion comes is in way of synergy later.. And I'm gladly sure about priorities of mine .. :P 

2013-9-30 E: nearly a hundred plays after the purchase, even if it was the best purchase EVER, it's a damn curse!! ANY AND ALL other games somehow feel plain :( Also it made me quit with buying games and my hunt for new ones lacks any vitality..
Just because ER has sooo many levels (strategic, tactic, mindfuck) one can play against the odds and the opponent, so fu*king many, multilayered and multiconnected levels to play in.. the richest gaming experience ever. Sadly I cannot imagine anything topping this in my lifetime.

Beyond the overall description: Euroish skeleton of the finest and meaningful qualities, fleshed with pure thematic ameritrash everything..
ER has this main gaming feelings, imho:
1. RPG [a) the most plastic and 'communicative'  characters in a 'board/minis game format', b)narrative and causal nature of each play, c) fully functional, interactive and changeable environment], action [not just a move-n-shoot scheme..] and tactical minis skirmish
2.economic game as for ultimately clear 
resources management [CP -'time', OT 'operative options' and MPs as VPs to gain and to spend too]
3. Strategy building game - yes, for the beginning, the map build play is a half of the winning strategy. It creates options that should match the faction playstyle, not only with its 'content' but the topology mainly..
Also, even if the core engine is the same, each faction plays 'asymmetrically' and it doesn't feel just like 'variable powers'.

It has a superb ratios of 1. math/open info 2.manageable luck and 3.bluff; while each element has many layers and interconnections with another.. 
[b]ER is the ultimate achievement for the most demanding gamers..[/b] And 'combined orders' module that is a pure nirvana! Yes it sounds all a bit complicated at first, but what fascinates me is that each story makes sense.

It personally feels intriguing, almost 100 plays later I'm rather at the beginning of grasping the bigger picture, from almost academical perspective.. So many nuances to try + unrepeatable stories each time = really feels like the fractal! Branching of storylines with each tiny decision reminds me the 'butterfly effect on a timespiral'. 
If the 'tree' of any other tabletop game under the sun (wargames and RPG aside ofc.) is definitely calculable then, let me exaggerate a bit, then the tree of ER is definitely not.. And yet it is RPG and wargame as well, not just a skimrih tabletoper heh! ..and I even haven't started to explore the indoor board frame.. that changes A LOT!!! 

This action/economic engine is undoubtly greatly expandable and hellyeah any and all EXPANSIONs would be as cool as my one and only true geeky BG-ish wish.. but as ER is now, ER will last fresh (4me4sure) for some next years or even decades.. ER redefines playability and re-playability, try to trust me on this, humbly Iv'e played vast majority of todays modern non-collectable big-games of: fictional theme settings and competetive playstyle and of action genre. If you are fan of this game sub-category, GO FOR IT NOW! (going to be OOS while already is OOP) 
Play it, reward is unparalleled. 

Ehm ER lives the best within the F2F community rather than within one or few regullar opponents circle..also to be totally fair and straight, okay, [b]some real cons or flaws [/b] I see them being an issue :
1. two palyer game - THE best! 4P faction 2on2 temaplay game - THE best known to me all accross the genres. ..BUT 3P mercenary game - I cannot recomend but the oppositte, I believe it is a bit broken, based on experiences. 
SO: Box should state 2/4 not 2-4P imho.
2. Graphics fail: If the lifetime keeper, freaking highlight the walls to stand out the corridors - makes grasping the topology of corridors overview RIGHT! (see forum on such topic for inspiration.)
3. in othervise one of the VERY best rulebooks I've ever been through, there is one scary blank spot on ruling ONE specific but very core and fundamental situation, that fortunatley appears only on the very advanced level of gameplay as it is resulded by complicated plots and combined actions planning overlaping more than one action phase.. This was imho just forgotten to be defined by single 0/1 sentence. (I do not know the answer, Chriss does not seem to be very responsive on ER topic).. 

PS> I CALL IT A LIE that setup takes forever, simply and TRULY because any scenario takes me to prepare 15 mins at most, usually under 10..and SAGS is played in SECONDS after the box hits the table! period. If I can do it you can work on it too :P

Ever final rating: 13 out of 10.

I almost passed on this game.  I can respect the fact that some people get excited by post-apocalyptic themes that include zombies, reconstituted humans, mechs, and the like.  I'm just not one of those people - that's pretty much the opposite of what excites me.  However, a close friend bought this game for me on the condition that I would teach it to him (you gotta love it when the opponent is included with the game!!), and the more I delved into the rulebook, the more excited I became!  Now, after playing through only the first couple of scenarios, I am completely hooked and rank this as my 6th-favourite game of all time!  Designer Christophe's other masterpiece, "Dungeon Twister", was also a favourite of mine, however I found that with that game, having 8 characters and seemingly endless options every turn made for a more brain-burning game than any other I have ever played.  But with the draw of the order tiles in "Earth Reborn", while the luck factor is certainly increased, the more limited options (although there are still PLENTY to choose from!) make for a noticeably easier play experience.  The components are high quality (with the figures being totally top notch!!), and the price of the game is an absolute steal for what comes in the box.  The only minor gripe with the components is the fact that the stark theme leads to dark board tiles, which leads to somewhat less clarity than would be desired.  That aside, there are so many cool little elements built into the game (I can't even begin to comprehend how much design and development went into it!), yet it is presented in a very approachable manner that is easily learned in stages over the course of several scenarios.  For tactical play combined with strategic play combined with quality components, I believe that this game is second only to the inimitable "War of the Ring".  "Earth Reborn" is truly a masterpiece.  Time will tell whether or not this game cracks my top 5 of all time...  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

First, the negatives; one, you literally have to watch a YouTube Video to learn how to put away the game pieces after removing them from the punch boards.  Without the video you will be hard pressed to make everything fit in the box.  Two, the board tiles are not numbered or identified in any particular way and constructing the game board from the tiny black and white picture for each scenario can be difficult.  Rumor has it that the game designer thought it would be fun for players to have to construct a "puzzle" to put the game away.  Personally I find it hilarious but I suspect many will be annoyed to spend a few hours playing the game only to have to solve a puzzle to put it away.  Despite those 2 problems, I highly recommend this game for most players.  The production values are VERY high, great art, amazing miniatures, and heavy card stock that just proclaim QUALITY.  The eerie Post Apocalyptic game setting and mood permeate every aspect of this title.  The scenarios are well designed, balancing game challenge, strategic choices, and a small bit of luck to create an engaging experience for the players.  I only wish there was the likelihood of more content to come to further expand an already terrific game!

RATING: 7.5
Very low unit-count squad-vs-squad game that is closer to tabletop skirmish games than any board game I can think of, but with unusually deep roleplaying elements (such as scavenging for equipment).

Mechanically, the key differentiator is the "duel". Each player has a limited number of command points (CPs) available to perform character actions, but they can also be used as a currency to blind-bid for initiative. These duels can take place at the start of a round or, more crucially, to allow a character to take an action interrupting an opponent's turn if the enemy character enters line of sight. As interrupts are in several respects more powerful than "normal" activations, in situations where opponents do or will have line of sight it can be more important to win the duel for interruption than to actually take the first activation. It's overwatch on crack.

It doesn't feel like anything else I've played. Some characters can move/act extraordinarily quickly, so a huge amount can be accomplished in a single activation (such as running from one end of the board to the other in one activation). The surrounding elements all work adequately, but the head-to-head psychology and resource-management of the duelling is the game.

Other amusing features include destructible terrain (why open a door when you can burst through a wall!), which is interesting chiefly for its intersection with the rules for line of sight and duelling. Other elements seem more bolted-on, such as the rules for capture, torture (?!) and searching.

These elements do allow for a remarkable depth and variety in scenario objectives: there's a lot of room here for surprising and unique games.

The downside, of course, is the complexity. While I'm skeptical that the campaign scenarios, which progressively introduce new rules, are worth playing at all (certainly the first, without duelling, is not), I'm also skeptical that all of the later rules add enough to be worth the complexity. Getting the most out of Earth Reborn requires significant investment; rules complexity is closer to a wargame than boardgame.

Other downsides include the embarrassingly terrible back-story (better to leave it as generic soldiers vs zombies), the ugly graphic design, the difficulty in seeing some critical information (such as close combat arcs on bases and anything on opponents' cards), some pretty bad miniature sculpts (what is wrong with Vasquez's neck?), and some of the expected pain of mixing resource management with dice rolling: to win a hard-fought duel and then roll poorly is unfortunate. 

My usual complaint about hybrid designs is that they're the worst of all worlds. The duelling mechanism is enjoyable, but there are games where that mechanism is not dressed up with so many bells and whistles (e.g. Rikki Tahta's Melee). Would I recommend playing that instead? In this case, no.

Earth Reborn is probably best viewed as an experience game, its rich thematic elements allowing surprising and unique plays, and the duelling just there to ratchet up the tension. The disappointingly bad back-story is somewhat problematic in this regard as interest in the theme adds significantly to its value as a storytelling machine. Still, it's a rich, involved sandbox that seems well worth the time for players willing to make the time investment.

I love the way that the game teaches itself while you walk through each scenario.  Each scenario builds the complete game by adding more complex mechanisms, step by step.  This game truly has everything that you could want in a tactical figure based war game.  The rules are intuitive and once you walk through the rule book and the scenarios you are ready to add new scenarios or create your own.  The possibilities seem endless.  I'd love it if they'd add an expansion and offer more factions!

When I first got into the hobby, Earth Reborn was one of the first games I got.  It looked AWESOME.  But...it mostly sat on my shelf.  The need to play through the training scenarios to get to the full game proved to be too much for me and my son to get through.  When we did play it we really liked the first couple of scenarios, but as we learned about the bidding for actions and played more with the order tiles we started to dislike the game.  We like games with more of an action point allowance system and overwatch is great but bidding throughout a game just kind of killed my son's excitement for it.  

Just shipped the game as part of a math trade.  Great game...just wasn't for us.

RATING: 2
The scenario we played didn't help my rating for this, but I still didn't like the base game. There are some interesting ideas, but it seems like there was an attitude of "quantity over quality" for the rules. "Let's toss in everything we can! Drawing tiles and command points and dice pools and blind bids and action point values all at once! Twenty two stats per character that just tell you how to attack! (slight exaggeration) Eight different firing arcs for each figure (not an exaggeration)!" All the stuff just doesn't seem to buy you anything; I never felt that the game was any deeper or more tactically interesting than other games in the genre like Space Hulk or Siege of the Citadel.
The minis are nice. The board is awful, with dark, confusing rooms that make it nearly impossible to tell where walls and openings are supposed to be.

Fine game but the learning game is so long that I wonder if I ever get to the full game, seeing how much playtime games usually get at my table.

Have played the first two scenario's, barely scratching the surface of this beast of a game. Requires time-investment, a thing I'm currently very short on. 

Will hold onto it though as it has more promise than other skirmish games in my collection (among those Gears of War, Claustrophobia and Galaxy Defenders.. says a lot).

[APR 2017] No time, no interested parties interested to devote the time necessary to flesh this thing out and a dip in interest in tactical skirmish games. Better to replace it with games that do see table time.

I know there's a small die-hard following for this game, and I wanted to get swept into that hype, but the game just fell flat for me. The miniatures are superb, the artwork is "eh" but it works within the overall presentation, and the components are all nice. The mechanics of the game are... thorough and robust. It really feels like the designers sat down and brainstormed all the actions a player may want to take while playing and tried to implement them into the system. While the design deserves a certain amount of applause, I also feel the system gets bogged down and collapses under its own weight a bit. At the end of the day, the game isn't the easiest to learn, and it's even less friendly to teach, which led me to selling the game. 

If the complexity isn't daunting and you have someone who is willing to be as invested in the game as you are, then you may find this game to be right up your alley. If you're interested in the general "feeling" of this game (a tactical board game with miniatures) but want something a bit easier to get into, I'd suggest checking out Tannhauser.

I've only played through the first few early missions in the rulebook, but thus far the game balance is incredibly lopsided.

Earth Reborn is the game I would have designed myself if I had ambition, talent, and imagination.  Luckily, Christophe Boelinger has all those qualities in spades.

I've only played Scenarios 1 and 2, but I doubt there's another game that uses its mechanics to convey setting, character, and humour so directly.  Impressive stuff, and I've only seen the tip of the iceberg.  With this much detail and options, you'd think the game would be a complete mess, but, at least early on, it would seem that it's completely under Boelinger's -- and therefore the players' -- control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Prologue:  Earth Reborn is a game that will be remembered for a long time.  It is a game changer, a history maker, and a story creator.  The depth and breadth of the game is staggering.  It is at times very Euro, very contra-Euro.  It will be talked about for years.  And I can say that I was there from the start.

After two plays of the first scenario.  Here is the kicker--the first scenario really only deals with two of the major rules:  orders and melee combat.  I'm giving this game an 8, and the entire rest of the game is still unplayed and undiscovered to me.  Each scenario not only changes the setting, it also adds layers to the game.

The best way I can describe it is that playing it is like playing an action movie.  Last night, my wife, while playing the NORAD faction, was surrounded in one small bedroom, as the zombies slowly but surely were descending upon her position.  It looked bleak, as Lt. Vazquez, though fleet afoot, is extremely weak in close quarters, and Franck Einstein, the flimsy minded oaf, was down to one last improbable option--blast a hole in the wall.  She plunked down an order tile costing 4 CPs for close combat, rolled 7 dice, and, when the smoke cleared, so did Vazquez.  Within a turn and a half, she had sprinted to her freedom.  Incredible.

This is a game that will stand the test of time.  It is also the best game of any type that I have played since Combat Commander.

UPDATE:

I feel compelled to scratch a few more thoughts out about ER.  I have played a total of 6 games now, and just dug into the third scenario last night (which encompasses the first two rulesets plus weapons).

This is an incredibly tactical game.  Really, it can play out like violent chess at times, with both sides not only calculating what they want to do, but also considering what the opponent may do.  The zombies won for the first time in 6 games last night (they are so incredibly slow--go figure) by a basic blitzkrieg straight down the map.  The good mad doctor made it safely to the lab, badly wounded, but healthy enough to jab himself in the neck with some toxic serum.  

The world then became dark and moaning.

What a game.  A true achievement in the world of boardgaming, it is not to be missed.  What a game.

RATING: 8.5
The design behind this game absolutely blows my mind. There are so many things to do and learn. There are so many scenarios to play. There are so many decisions. And the theme is oozing out of every single component and scenario. Not to mention how incredibly well the story line for the entire thing is. I'm not usually a thematic gamer, but this game has the theme, AND the strategy, AND the tactics, AND the challenge, AND the replayability. AND AND AND! I highly suggest this game to theme gamers, tactical gamers, and war gamers alike. As for Euro gamers, before this game I probably would have considered myself right next to a pure Euro gamer. Earth Reborn has pulled me a few steps closer in the other direction.

I'm quite surprised I'm doing this, but this game is immediately going into my top 10. And it's getting a 9.5 rating after the first two scenarios. Now to plan in the time for the next scenarios!...

UPDATE: I've now played the game four times. Twice as a two-player and twice as a four-player game. I'm dropping my ranking from a 9.5 to a 9 simply because when played as a four-player game, it's longer than I prefer. Don't get me wrong, the game is still great, but it starts to feel slow after a few hours of it. Perhaps this could all change once I get higher into the scenarios and learn all the rule sets, but for now, it brings the rank down. Down to a 9! Ha! So I still consider it one of the most outstanding games available today.

UPDATE: 3/29/12 - One more ratings drop to an 8.5 for being so hard to get to the table and to teach to new players. You really have to have somebody close by who is willing to spend a lot of time playing this game. My wife isn't interested in games with miniatures--it turns her off immediately. So unfortunately it collects some dust. :(

Hm, tough to call this one after one very introductory scenario.  I didn't like the one game I played all that much, just because I don't feel like I got to scratch more than the barest rules with it, and I don't think that it was worth the time.  I think that I'd feel a little bit better if I got to play one of the shooting scenarios, but this still doesn't really seem like my cup of tea.  The theme's alright, but I'm not sure that I could get this fast enough that I'd want to play it without playing it tens of times, and that's simply more time than I want to sink into this game.

UPDATE: Rebought after careful examination of the packing instruction video.

Are you a Warhammer fan or someone who meets regularly to wargame with a friend of similar skill? Can you commit about 10 hours to learning game rules through tutorial scenarios? Do you want a flexible wargame system that's endlessly replayable? Earth Reborn is probably for you.

It's a tactical skirmish game with lots of freedom, flexibility and realism. Its plus points are the toilet humour, silly theme and unfiddly rules/play compared to War hammer or a wargame. The board can be endlessly configured for different scenarios.

Trouble is that this flexibility comes with a price. The board comes in about 30 little pieces of different sizes with murky graphics, which need to be identified and assembled before the game can begin. This has taken us up to an hour, even with careful packing and repacking of the bits. Oddly enough, my enthusiasm for playing wanes by the time I get to the game.

The game also needs a heavy commitment of time, week-after-week to play through the tutorial scenarios. Play only occasionally and it's easy to forget everything. 

I also find the heavy theming is a problem. It's sufficiently immersive that I get upset when my characters get blooded or shot. I prefer disposable characters I don't care about! 

Finally, the artwork is a matter of taste. It looks like an explosion in a paint factory. All the components are, however, excellent quality.

It's a shame the game is asking for such a level of investment in time. The rules are sometimes too complicated for nothing (the search mechanics... PLEASE !).
It's really good gameplay when you're in it, but then you finally got yourself through the NINE tutorial missions, you'll most likely never play it again : you can't teach the rules to someone else in one time.
Be sure you have a gaming partner !

Earth Reborn offers nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, escort. Through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more. Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial: There are core rules to start the game and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules.

This game is MASSIVE. If you're into tactics, buy it. This is as close to a wargame, as a board game can be, without going board-less. There are many rules, and they are added as you play each scenario in order, which is a very good design - this way, while the game is really complicated, new rules are introduced one by one. Mechanics are great. Figurines are awesome. Board looks beautiful, though the graphics aren't that great.
I've found only one flaw: it's really hard to find a partner to play the game, since you probably need to go through every scenario with every person you want to play. Takes a lot of time to set up.

We're on a quest to play through all of the scenarios one week at a time.  Only two scenarios into the programmed instruction booklet, there's already a lot going on - and all of it is good.  It even makes retroactive sense as to why certain actions are allowed or disallowed, and why certain rules exceptions exist.  It comes down to the playtesting of all possible rules interactions, and thankfully the designer has done his homework.  Everything works just the way it should, and for all the right reasons.

When opening the box, our initial concern was that a game with a handful of miniatures couldn't add up to much.  We were mistaken.  [i]Earth Reborn[/i] delivers a tense, thinky gaming experience, even with only eight small-scale figures slipping and sliding across a bleak, futuristic wasteland.  

The scenarios, which are the heart and soul of the game, have lived up to our expectations. They are polished and well-balanced, which is more than I can say for the equivalent Fantasy Flight "experience" games (Doom, Descent, etc.).

In general, my only advice is to be sure to read the interruption, orders, and movement sections carefully (especially as new rules are introduced), as these basic mechanics set the stage for the entire ER experience. A missed or misinterpreted rule is like a systemic infection: it's painful and distracting, and it needs to be cleared up as soon as possible.

Playing this with a non miniature player and she does not like the game.  Basically, her sentiments, which I dont disagree with, are that the game is far too complex for the little action that is actually taking place.

I find the game to have very interesting decisions, but I admit that the game is high in complexity for simple actions.  Run down a hall?  draw a tile, hope it has the movement icon, allocate command points, multiply your allocated points by your movement allowance, duel for initiative any time you round a corner, make sure you spot all the yellow dotted lines you're not supposed to cross, then count your spaces.  Oh ya, remember how to use the kind of door you're passing through, and be sure to turn your model the right way when you're done.

All the nitpicking about how to perform a simple action means that there are actually meaningful decisions involved in the whole process, but it really does bog the game down to the point where there is VERY little action for the time invested.

I think the system, once learned, could be really interesting and compelling.  I really like the theme, and I actually enjoyed playing through some of the scenarios.  Unfortunately my partner did not.

When I considered going back to some old miniature games the fun to time investment ratio really just doesnt do the game justice.

7 for a good game that probably works better for mini players who love complexity.  I am one of those people, but I see this as a niche game and one that probably wont be played over other mini games.

Also the english rules are not well written IMO.  they are worded quite poorly in many instances and are overly verbose when trying to describe simple things.

Upgrading to 7.5 after playing Mansions of Madness.  That game truly sucks and made me appreciate the depth of theme and strategy in this one.  I'd really like to play ER again with someone who's up for a brain burning mini game.

Long time to set up. Icons are clear but the art design is horrible :/

This game is like a fricken jigsaw puzzle from hell.  That one little statue of the chick with the gun is hot tho.  5 points for her!

Haven't played with EVERY scenario yet... but have every confidence that when that happens this game will be bumped to a 10. You MUST play this game.

Tied with Descent as the best miniature skirmish game.  Very rich theme and detailed scenarios.

great minis, nice board, nice cards, great post apocalyptic feel. Wish the setup was quicker and it worked better with more then 2 players.

Very good skirmish game. Good quality components (and lots of them) and interesting theme-heavy gameplay. High learning curve if you dive straight into a full game, but has good learning scenarios where you learn the rules few at a time. Setting is your everyday post-apocalyptic scenario, but it's depicted in very tongue-in-cheek, trashy way and that's very much up in my alley. If the gameplay can hold the thrill (as it propably will) rating will rise. (edit: after a week of my first session, I've been thinking about this game almost every day, I rise the rating from 8->9 for now)

There's been a lot of bitching about a long set up time, but in my experience, this takes much less time to set up than for example Arkham Horror. Just follow designer's hint and lay out bigger rooms first and work your way to smaller ones and finally doors. You can lay out every pre-made scenario in 5-10 minutes.

This looks amazing, and possibly a good contender for a game my wife would play.

After 1 Play: The limited rules of the first scenario are so simple as to render the game completely pointless. It's possible the game gets better, but if you start me off with a terrible scenario, I'm never going to find out. Oh, and the amount of time it took to set up was completely unacceptable.

Unsure about this rating, as I haven't tried the game out fully yet. "Unsure" meaning it might be higher, but not lower.

I am biased, as I am a dungeon crawl enthusiast, but this is lavishly produced, and carries simple (yes, simple!) rules that have been mashed into being adaptable, and thus are very very complex when put together. But they contain all of what you want to do with a dungeon crawler.

It's two teams battling and exploring on a modular board, with a lot of dice, cards, special powers and whatever. Like Space Hulk. There is no dungeon master here, only players.

One downside is the time it takes to set up a scenario. But it's a small downside, actually. The biggest downside is actually that the base game is very geared at two players. There are 3–4 player scenarios to download, and I'll use them like hell, but I'd wanted the game to be more multiplayer to begin with. I think the game will shine more when there are more players with differing interests.

C - Usado, buen estado. Golpe en caja.

RATING: 8.5
Has an amazing potential to tell epic stories in a roleplay group of players. It has the best tactical gameplay I saw in a boardgame miniature game. Setup and explanation is a bitch though.

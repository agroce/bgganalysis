I think there's little to choose between Chimera and Haggis as three-player climbing card games.  A point in favour of Haggis is its more easily remembered card combinations (just sets, sequences and bombs) compared to oddities like a pair of triplets, each with an unrelated card attached in Chimera.  Chimera's greater flexibility in its combinations makes for lightning fast hands, but, on the downside, demands less thought about how to get rid of those odds and sods in a hand.  Chimera has the high bidder playing against their two opponents and gaining extra cards in compensation.  It's high bid or nothing approach creates more tension than the bidding in Haggis. 

I prefer the way that Haggis gives each player three wild cards to the random deal of the powerful Pi Ya and Chimera cards.  I dislike the way that the Pi Ya/Chimera combination is both the most powerful in the game and you can score just for playing it.  I do like Chimera's higher ranking but valueless heroes and the way that only two card values score end of hand points, as opposed to seven in Haggis. 

I have always found Tichu's cards ugly and Chimera's are their ugly twins.  Card quality is excellent.  Z-Man's box with an empty slot for a second deck isn't the most egregious waste of space on my shelves, but it irritates all the same.  The rules are fine.

RATING: 7
3 Player Tichu.

One player plays the Chimera, and the two hunters play against him/her.  The Chimera gets 3 extra cards, and needs to get out first.  The hunters win if one person goes out before the Chimera.

Not as "brutal" as Tichu can be in terms of limited sets, because there are now triples with "attached cards" which allow you to easily get rid of singles.

Pi Ka = Phoenix
Chimera = Dragon 
No Dog or Bird
Heroes are new thing, where they are higher than any numbered card, but can't be used for anything else.

Need to try more with Tichu fans.

My group plays quite a bit of this and Tichu.  I like it better than Tichu.  The 2-on-1 element and having to bid every round just cranks up the tension.  While explaining the various leads makes everyone's eyes roll the first time, I've never had anyone not understand the game within two hands.  Almost everyone I've introduced to the game loves it.  I was skeptical of making the purchase unplayed, especially given the fact that Haggis plays all right at 3, but I'm so glad I gave this a try.

A trick-taking, Tichu-like game exclusively for 3 players. I'm not a fan of this genre, but it's an interesting game for those that are fans.  To my knowledge its one of the few games that allows you to discard random/junk cards when you play a large meld, making it easier for you to empty your hand and "go out", which is the goal.

A very good 3-player trick taker (right up there with Haggis).

Interesting dynamic with the 2 vs. 1 play, where you want to go out first, but in the points on the cards are very important as well, so you don't always want to just play to go out.

Also, the many different card combinations you can play take out some of the luck of the deal, as you can play yourself out of some bad cards. Many other games, such as Tichu, rely much heavier on simply getting a good hand of cards.

RATING: 7
A climbing game for 3 players only. Although the number of players limits the amount of times this will hit the table, Chimera is a nice twist on climbing games: 1 vs 2. Bidding who becomes the chimera is fast and the combinations that are allowed are a mix of familiar and new combos. Pretty fun.

Wow. Very pleasantly surprised. 3-player rules in the Tichu box are lame, so why would a stand-alone Tichu variant be any better? I don't know. But it is. There are some decisions that I would have initially thought were bad ideas (allowing a triple plus a single as a legal combo???), but it works. It helps to reduce the number of singleton tricks. Also having suited "dragons" plus the "uber-dragon". Bombs have been improved by removing the timing issue (play on your turn only). Many more good things to say. I expect this to be a permanent game bag item, for when we have 3 instead of 4.

If you're looking for a 3-player substitute for Tichu, you might be disappointed. It is not as exciting, and is even more complicated. Still the best climbing card game for 3 players I suppose.

I'm interested to try also the classic Dou Dizhu scoring rules, I'm not convinced that this version is really better.

Since I'm a big Tichu fan but we always seem to be one person short, I couldn't resist Chimera which is advertised as Tichu for three. After my first game, I have to say that they didn't lie. The basic feel of Chimera reminds me a lot of Tichu. But with the removal of the partnerships, they added a new twist to the formula. Since there are no shared victories, you can't never be sure if your hunting partner won't just go for straight points by collecting treasures instead of stopping the Chimera. This adds a new dimension to the game that I'd like to explore further. Nice stuff!

Chimera is a good 3-player card game.  It's not Tichu, but I suppose you could call it a Tichu-like.  Basically plays out in a 2 v. 1 where the 1 is in the only position to score points, but instead of passing around the Chimera/Landlord title, you have to bid on it.  Fun stuff.

Like a crapload of Asian card games making their way over to the West, publishers are putting fancy designs and oversized boxes onto something that pretty much plays with a standard deck of cards with any proxies you might like (blank cards, jokers, etc).  I'm actually surprised that nobody has tried to box Big 2 or 13-Cards (Chinese Poker) into a fancy box and sell it.  Pfft.

At any rate, pick up the rules from here or elsewhere and just play this with a standard deck of cards.  The Z-Man box shamefully only comes with one deck and outside of some fancy artwork, there are only two special cards which can easily be proxied with the use of the two jokers in your standard $6 Bicycle deck.

Climbing game.  For three players, definitely better than Tichu. Ralph Anderson Game published by Z-Man.  Concept developed from Fight the Landlord ([url=http://www.pagat.com/climbing/doudizhu.html]Dou Dizhu[/url])

See my review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1888993

Haggis is best with 2, Chimera best with 3, and Tichu best with four.

Too complex?  See Opinionated Gamers review: 
http://opinionatedgamers.com/2014/12/05/dale-yu-review-of-chimera/

Another 3 player option is Haggis, but Chimera has advantage that two players are working together as "Hunters" against the "Chimera". See also: [thread=1429954][/thread]

But do not confuse new Tichu players by switching to, or switching back and forth with, Chimera, because there are a number of differences in play.

Chimera delivers a great great climbing/shedding game for three that sits nicely alongside its contemporaries Tichu and Haggis. The crux of what makes it unique and exciting is that two players (the Hunters) try to take down the Chimera (the player who bids, thinking they can finish first). Chimera offers a large does of Tichu's high risk high reward structure by providing the Chimera with a few additional cards if/when they set the bid, but also provides the Hunters one (possible) opportunity to trade cards. The collaboration is uneasy, ambivalent, and sometimes devious -- only when your partner is well behind you that you will be wholly helpful (e.g., pass them off a few good cards). The Traps (AKA Bombs) appear slightly more frequently than in Tichu, but nowhere near as often as in Haggis, also become a risk/reward for Hunters as should they fail to catch the Chimera, winning the hand becomes all the more triumphant (via bonus points). Super neat game of shifting alliances in which many probing gazes are shared.

Also, the art on the cards is just beautiful.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2015)

I was pleasantly surprised. Chimera is a novel climbing game and is now my second favorite climbing game, only surpassed by Haggis in this regard. I love that two players are playing against the Chimera :D.

The rules are pretty simple but I would have loved some player aids to help players remember what are the legal tricks. It is a minor complain as you will memorize them in 5 minutes. The game choices aren’t obvious and I think skill is way more important than luck in Chimera.

It is the third 3 player only game I have played, I want to compare it to Cosmic Eidex so I will try to play it soon again, then I will see which one I prefer, however, my gut feeling tells me Chimera is the better game.

I really dig the box´s cover.
 
On the bad side, I found the game to be very expensive for only a deck of cards.

Bottom line, I enjoyed my only play of Chimera. I really want to play it again soon. It has a high probability of getting an upgrading rating from me. For now, Chimera is a keeper in my game collection.

This is referred favorably as "3-player Tichu".  I've taught this to non-Tichu fans and they enjoyed it more than Tichu since you are mainly playing for your own victory (non-partnership).  I like the theme of The Chimera versus The Hunters and the rules for allowing to flexibly add "a kicker or kicker pairs" to Triplets makes learning or going out easier to resolve one's hand.  It's still has highly similar amount of depth and strategy as Tichu, but Chimera is quicker, more flexible hand management and thus easier to learn/play while still being a complex enough card game that skill will usually win over luck.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this climbing game where the first to 400 wins. Took a few rounds before we were able to get past our Tichu experiences and understand the different sets that exist in this game and how to play the cards a bit better. Most points here are scored by taking the bid and being the chimera (although if you fail to go out first as the chimera you will likely lose or be close to 0 points).

This game starts from a good place given my unabashed love of Tichu and Haggis, and the similarities between them. I've played the Chinese game it's modelled after, so it's not all new to me. The permissible combinations are higher on rules overhead than Tichu or Haggis. There is some of the same risk-taking from those games, and I like the 2v1 dynamic that changes from hand to hand, but there are some differences too.  It needs more play.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The deck has cards in 4 suits (1-12, Hunter), Pia, and Chimera. First bidder is chosen randomly (cut deck, reveal card; person who's dealt that card bids first). Deal all but 3 cards.

Legal bids are 20, 30, 40; winner = "Chimera", other 2 are "Chimera Hunters". Chimera takes the kitty. Others pass 0, 1, or 2 cards (depending on winning bid) to each other. Chimera leads. Legal plays are: singles, pairs, stepped pairs (6+ cards), trips, stepped trips, straights, and "traps". Trips, including when in sequences, can be played with singles or pairs attached. Traps (4-of-a-kind or Pia-Chimera) are played on your turn; P-C is highest trap in game. Pia can be played as a wild (but not in a trap) or as second-highest single.

All players score VP for 2s and 11s taken. If Chimera goes out first, score 2 x bid (otherwise, lose bid). Chimera also earns bonus points for each other player failing to play any cards, each trap played, and ... something else? The game ends when someone scores 400+ pts; the player with the most VP wins!

3p-only climbing/shedding game, sort of like 3p Tichu. Players bid to be the chimera, who scores points if they go out first; the other two players form a temporary alliance as the hunters.

Only a few plays. First impression is that it's not bad but I dislike a number of features, including bonus points for a chimera's own traps (reward them further for lucking into an extremely powerful combination) and the way hunter card passing works in practice (no opportunity for signalling so often zero information prior to exchange; individual scoring for 2/11 a disincentive to teamwork). The designer has commented (albeit with obvious bias) that it does work well but it may take more experience to shine. I'm not convinced and would likely suggest a different game.

RATING: 8
My rating based on the gameplay alone.

The box is too big and they should have, and easily could have, included a second deck of cards just like Tichu. This helps speed up the game tremendously because one person can be shuffling a deck while another person deals out cards for the next round. Most egregiously, there is even a whole empty section in the box insert for a second deck. $14 is way overpriced for basically a standard deck of cards, especially when Tichu is $10 for two decks. Very disappointed in ZMan for this, and I encourage everyone to just use a standard deck of cards and mark the jokers as the Chimera and Pi Ya instead of paying for this game. The game is just a slightly modified deck of 52 cards plus the Pi Ya and Chimera, so a standard deck and jokers would work perfectly.

Now for the game itself: Great three-player version of Tichu. Playing as the Chimera can be incredibly tense, because you never know when an opponent might throw down a trap (bomb) and take the lead, ruining your chance to go out first.
My main complaint is that the game isn't quite as elegant as Tichu. You can only use the Pi Ya (Phoenix) as a wild card in a straight instead of any combination, you have to remember which bonuses have been played during a round, and you can play a pair of cards or three consecutive pairs of cards but not two consecutive pairs. There are a few other little rules like that, but I'm sure it won't be such an issue after they have been internalized after a few more games.

Great game. Buy yourself a standard deck of cards (or even better, a bridge-sized deck) and have fun.

RATING: 8
We liked this game more than we expected. Certainly more than Haggis. It´s a game that you want to continue paying more hands once you reach the appointed limit.

Three player only trick taking cutthroat card game. Bid player is against the other two to go out first. A Tichu variant. Be the first to play out all your cards. Lead with sets, stepped pairs, trips or minimum five card straights. Singles and pairs can be dumped by attaching to your lead. Special cards for traps and bombs and combos for scoring.

I could see this game easily rated higher, but for me, it was more puzzly than I like in a game. On a turn, it felt like there was a clear right move, but there are so many options, you can't quite find the right place fast enough. This gets easier as the game progresses, but early on, it is brutal. The game I played moved quickly because we were all wanting it to, but that left me unsatisfied. Beautiful production values - not my kinda of game.

A good game, with the strategy being far more in the placement of your workers rather than the tiles. The art is rather dreary and the end-game can really drag.

Maharani is something of a multi-player puzzle.  Each turn you are presented with four pieces of the puzzle and the challenge is to see which one is the best fit in terms of scoring and/or preventing others from scoring.  Early on, the downtime is yawning because there are so many placement options.  What's more, there is nothing for players to do between turns, since forward planning is stymied by the churn of available tiles and the changing state of the board.  Mercifully, the game does speed up as the board fills, leaving fewer options.

Ultimately, it feels to me as though Maharani is strategically shallow. In a four-player game, concentrate your workers in two quarters of the board.  Otherwise, grab as many points as possible, turn by turn.

The filled board looks quite pretty and the game has the usual Queen production values.

 Set up it is beautiful to behold.  But we just didn't like the see-saw game play. Draw a tile , score gold (otherwise known as points. Why they cal it gold we have no idea. There are no coins. There aren't even score chits. Just a scoring track that , by the way, doesn't show coins or gold either), use gold to play another tile is you scored any gold (otherwise known as points), place a worker, score gold (otherwise known as points), use gold (otherwise known as gold {have I mentioned this before? can you guess that I found it dumb?}) to place more worker to score gold (otherwise known as ... oh you get the idea), then move one to the next player who repeats said process. There's a spinner in the middle fo the board that points to the current player which is a good mechanic but since all the tiles have arrows that show the direction they must be facing to be played and that arrow shifts with the spinner it is just a gimmick. This game is just lather, rinse, repeat and it doesn't do that well. We can clearly see why it came free with the Thebes KS from Queen Games. It just isn't good.

Great little abstract with nice pieces and light but competitive gameplay. Very luck-heavy at times, but strategic enough that you can plan a couple of moves in advance and block another player before their turn. I liked the rules for using two sets of meeples for two-players, and always use the multi-colored columns from the mini-expansion.

A fairly straightforward tile laying game with scoring workers and a very pretty board.

Missed a key rule to start with that you get workers back once a quadrant is scored, which makes a difference in your planning. The rondel and directional arrows prevents this from being too simple and dull and ensures you have to think a little bit about were best to place the tiles, but obviously what comes out of the bag has a huge effect. That said, there are alwasy four options and means to alter the luck of the draw slightly, albeit at a cost.

Good fun.

This game is under rated. The artwork is attractive, it's easy to learn, and plays fairly quickly. We've had the experience where in the beginning it's just a slow race with small scoring of points, but halfway through we suddenly "get it" and then the points start to rack up really quickly. Manipulating the build-up of the different quadrants was quite fun. The end result is a board that's quite nice to look at.

Kipróbáltuk a 3 fős játékot. Nem túl bonyolult szabályokkal rendelkező, eléggé absztrakt játékmenetű, családi játék. Nekem sajnos nem volt túl izgalmas, de a többiek élvezték a színes mozaikok meghatározott rendű lepakolását. A játék arról szól, hogy építészeket alakítunk, akik a Taj Mahal palotája mozaik padlózatának lerakásában segédkeznek, amelyért bizonyos összeget kapnak. Aki a végén a legtöbb pénzzel rendelkezik, az nyer. A padlózat 4 negyedre van felosztva, melyre a mozaikokat a központi részen található 4 db mozaikból választhatunk (a mozaikokat egy zsákból véletlenszerűen húzunk). A mozaikokat bizonyos szabályok szerint lehet lerakni, melyre meghatározott rendben munkásokat is lehet pakolni. A játékban alapvetően azt kell kiszámolni, hogy az aktuális 4 mozaikból hogyan tudunk maximum kettőt úgy elhelyezni, hogy abból a lehető legtöbb pénzt lehessen kinyerni, nem mellesleg arra is odafigyelve, hogy a fennmaradt mozaikok a következő játékosnak ne hozzanak túl sok pénzt. A lényeg, hogy szerintem az egész játékot az határozza meg, hogy éppen aktuálisan milyen lapkák (mozaikok) közül választhatunk, az mennyire passzol nekünk vagy sem. Családok jól el lehetnek vele, de nem véletlen, hogy a gémer társadalom eléggé leszavazta. A játék egyik legnagyobb hibája, hogy nagy az AP (analízis-paralízis) veszélye és nem mellesleg családi játéknak túl hosszú. Nekünk az első játék két és fél órán át tartott. (2014.09.20.)

Beautiful abstract.  I'm not a fan of abstracts but I like this.  Plays fast and fairly randomly though there is scope for a little skill and judgement.  There is an attracive Alhambra element to the way the mosiac develops.  The tension derives from placing tiles to maximise pounts through contiguous colours, or 'man' placement on similar colours.

I played Maharani twice, and while it's a perfectly inoffensive tile laying game, there was nothing special about it.  The rondel setting the orientation of the tiles didn't really give any variation, just made it change things for one player compared to another, in a way that felt arbitrary and silly.  I wouldn't turn down a game, but had no desire to keep it in the collection either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Interesting tile placement game that starts off very slowly but quickly builds. Luck is a large factor and can lead to wild differences in scores as the tile draw is completely random

Points are scored for adjacent tiles of the same colour and for adjacent workers of the same colour, but players can only have one worker stood on each tile colour in a quarter,and may only place them if the orientation of the tile is 'correct' thus makes the worker placement quite interesting and unique.

There are also bonus points based on the number of workers in a quarter when it scores.

The rondel in the middle dictates which tiles are free to place in each quarter, although you may still spend an action to place a tile in any quarter, and this rotating aspect creates differing options for each player based upon where on the board they sit. This means that whilst a tile may be utterly useless to you with a single 90 degree rotation it may be exactly what your opponent requires.

I enjoyed this and it is a welcome addition to my collection although I gather my gaming partners were less impressed with this one than I.

I took a punt on this as It looked interesting and I generally like Queen Games, both for gameplay and their production values.  

I enjoyed our first game and although we found it extremely simple to play there is plenty of depth that players can choose to analyse should they want to.

Gameplay is by placing a single tile onto a board, with a worker should the tile be orientated with the arrow pointing towards the player, and claiming points for chain of similar colour tiles and workers.  
Additionally, when a quadrant is completely filled with tiles it is then scored on the number of workers per player colour in that quadrant.  This makes the game more interesting as workers are limited so timing the placement of these workers so as to maximise this scoring is critical.

Overall I can recommend this game for people who like abstracts and especially at the current low price it is being sold at.

Nagyon egyszerű lapkalerakós játék. A szabályt 3 perc alatt el lehet mondani, és lemegy egy party 30-45 perc alatt. Mindezek ellenére első játék után még nem teljesen állt számomra össze, hogy mit kéne csinálni, nem egyértelmű a nyerő stratégia, ami jó dolog. Az mondjuk biztosnak tűnik, hogy van benne azért szerencse, hogy kinek, hogy jönnek fel a lapkák. Ezen felül kicsit kellemetlen volt két fővel, hogy a középjátékban voltak teljesen alibi körök, ahol mindketten legszívesebben passzoltunk volna, mert beállt a tábla rossz lapkákkal, és minden egyes lapka elvétele, csak annak az esélyét növelte, hogy a másiknak behúzunk helyette egy jót.
6.5

----
Négyesben kipróbálva javult a véleményem róla. Jó kis filler és/vagy családi játék ez, amiben azért bőven van döntési helyzet, valamennyi szerencsével fűszerezve. Tekintve, hogy mindez 30-45 perc, nincs ezzel baj.

Eine Legespiel mit gewohntem Abrechnungsmodus. Der Glücksanteil beim Nachziehen der Mosaikplättchen ist beträchtlich. Anfangs lau, entsteht in der Mitte des Spiels plötzlich Spannung und in den letzten Spielzügen kann das Ergebnis völlig kippen. Ambivalentes Spielgefühl zwischen leichter Anmut und mittlerem Käse.

The spinner deal in the middle is gimmicky and doesn't add much to the strategy. This is just another bland tile laying, set collection Euro with a gimmick. Pass on this if you can as its really 'meh'. My kids are bored silly by this game.

Decent enough tactical abstract. Not much strategy, other than get out lots of guys. Maybe you could use the wheel mechanism to look ahead a little bit? Don't know if that would be worthwhile. Would play again but don't see a lot of depth here. One competitor pointed out that a better theme would be building disco floors, since that's what the board ends up looking like.

Méltánytalanul mellőzött rendkívül szép kivitelű családi játék. A játéktér közepén négy mozaik van, amelyet a játéktér négy részére rakhatjuk le. A lerakás szabályai:
a középről elvett lapkát arra a negyedre rakhatjuk le, ahonnan elvettük. Ha máshová akarjuk lerakni akkor az negyedre vonatkozó saját jelölőnket le kell fordítanunk. A lapot úgy kell lerakni, hogy az oszlopok a megfelelő helyekre kerüljenek. Ha sikerül lerakni úgy a lapkát, hogy a nyíl felénk mutasson, akkor rárakhatunk egy embert. 

A lerakásnál pontokat kapunk minden egymás mellett lévő színű lapokért és az egymás mellett lévő bábuinkért kapunk. Kettőt visszalépve lerakhatunk még egy lapkát. 
Ha egy negyedben az összes lapkát leraktuk kiértékeljük és az ott lévő bábuk után pontokat kapunk.

The most remarkable thing about Maharani is that although it's a competitive game, players tend to show other players possible best moves. This speaks for the puzzle-like nature of gameplay, 100% open information and a tendency of players not worrying about the result as drawing the right tiles with the right orientation is more determining than planning ahead once all players optimize their move. A nice family-type game if players don't mind solving puzzles.

A simple game, with deep strategy; really rewarding. You attempt to get groups of colored tiles together, and your workers, however, the other players can score of these groupings too. The way to pull away is by getting as many colors out in a quadrant to score bonus points as well.

Smooth playing family game, mechanism with the wheel works very well. Typical Queen game, high production values. More fun than expected, full of tactical decisions, nothing strategical, plenty of luck invlolved as well.

RATING: 8
Strip away the beauty of the completed board, strip away the wonderfully clever contained theme and what you are left with is a fiercely complicated and devilishly tricky area control abstract executed in multiple dimensions.  Color control contends with zone control with fights with the limited resources of both worker and tiles, and all this lets you jockey for position in each arena, both metaphorical and physical.  It is the best kind of hurt for anyone who loves both tile laying and euro resource management and stands to unseat many tile layers in my collection.

Has less theme than my freshly laundered socks and just barely more strategic decisions. Due to the random nature of the tile draw planning ahead is questionable at best and every round presents a pretty clear best move. If I play a game by using an algorithm I might as well have a machine do the calculations.

An abstract game, the kind of game you get bored with after a few games.
In each turn, you just pick your most efficient move; no overall strategy or long term decisions.

Super fun tile-laying, thematic abstract game!  It has two of the best things in games: tiles and a rondel.  The rondel is very simply used, and is a neat mechanic in this game.  Lining up pillars, matching colored tiles, getting the tiles oriented so you can place your meeples, all add up to good fun!

This game is best at 4 and only 4. 2 is fine, but I'd rather play another 2 player game. For how relatively simple the rules are, this game really twists your mind. I've been pleasantly surprised with each play of it. Plenty of replayability due to the random drawing of the tiles as well as spinning of the center board. A very overlooked Queen game.

I think that in it's genre (puzzle games like Ubongo (but without the time pressure)), this is a good game. Only, it's not my favorite genre. If you really wanna play well at this game you have to consider each tile in each quadrant and so you can have some serious downtime if everybody does that.

This a gorgeous area majorities/tile laying game.  On your turn, you take a tile and add it to the board, along with a worker. The tile needs to fit into the spot, which can be tricky thanks to pillars printed on the board. The primary object is to have as many workers as you can in one of the quarters of the map when that quarter is completely full and therefor scores. There are bonus points for adding to contiguous chains of a color, or chains of your own workers.  One interesting limitation is in any given quadrant, you only can have one worker per color of tile you've eligibly placed. If you add a second tile of that same color, the worker you had in there already moves to the new position.

The game plays quickly, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. There's some flip luck mitigation but you'll still end up with some turns when you eat a bad tile, only to flip the perfect tile for your opponent. The game also doesn't feel different from session to session, but I find the core experience enjoyable enough to forgive these things. I also feel that the two "queenie" mini expansions add a lot to the experience of this game.

Puzzle-ly games with random draws don't work for me -- too little ability to plan, so it's just a series of unconnected optimization puzzles.  There;s not real opportunity for strategy, and the game gets pretty repetitive pretty quickly.  Once the computation is done, the best choice is always the one that offers the most points.

Light-playing abstract, I think in the style of older, classic euros. Plays quick. If you don't like it, you won't be at the table long. :p
The theme works toward teaching new players. I taught my young daughters (ages 8+) the game by saying, "okay, the Queen wants her palace floor tiled. Now she likes to see tiles of the same color close together. So she is going to pay extra for that. Also, she likes to see her servants working shoulder-to-shoulder. That will get a bonus..."

This is NOT my style of game! It is an abstract tile-laying game where you are trying to score points by creating large contiguous areas of the same color, and/or groups of your meeples. There are some cool things here (rotating platform, timing and pace of the game, cycling of your meeples) but the game feels a bit too random (the order that tiles come into pay) and seems to drag (it's difficult planning anything until it's your turn). Not so bad with 2, but I'd guess it would be worse with 4 players.

--- Summary ---
There are 4 tiles on display at a time (10 unique tiles in 6 colors). These are placed on a lazy Susan (in 4 areas corresponding to the 4 parts of the board) in the center, each tile's arrow pointing at the active player. On your turn, either:
- flip your 4 tokens (corresponding to the 4 quarters of the board) back to the face-up side; end your turn immediately
OR
- take a tile and place it on the board (must match edges exactly). To place it in a non-matching quadrant, you must flip the token (according to the quarter of the lazy susan from which you're taking the tile) face down. Score 1 VP per tile in the block of tiles matching that color. Then, if the tile's arrow is pointing at you:
... if this is the first tile of that color you've placed in the quarter, place your Meeple on it. 
... if not the first, move the Meeple from the other tile to this one
... Then, score 1 VP per Meeple (of yours) in a contiguous block.
- if you placed a tile may do so a second time; at the end of your turn, lose 2 VP

If you place the last tile in a quarter, I immediately score it: players score 4/6/9/13/18/24 VP if they have 1/2/3/4/5/6 meeples there, then retrieve their meeples. 

The game ends when all tiles have been played, and all quarters scored: most VP wins!

I feel bad about not rating this one better since I won it in the Queen contest -- how sharper than a serpent's tooth...

The main mechanism is tile placement based on a number of conditions. First you place a tile, which scores a point for itself and a point for each tile of the same colour it is placed with; then, if the arrow on the tile is pointing towards you, you place a worker, which scores a point for itself and a point for each worker of the same colour it is with. Conditions on placement include features of the tile and board quadrant.

(I do not mention the theme because it is pasted on and unlikely to add one whit to your enjoyment of the game. Nice art on board and tiles, though, and Queen's production is stellar as always.)

This all works quite well and provides a nice balance of scoring -- tiles vs people vs special scoring when each quadrant is completed. The random tile draws are a little annoying, but the real sin is that forward planning is essentially impossible; even where tiles are visible ahead of time, which is rare for anything useful, the stupid rotating rondel adds a degree of unnecessary difficulty and mental rotation. The end result is that there is little point doing any thinking at all until it's your turn, which in turn can slow the game to a crawl if you're unfortunate enough to be playing with someone prone to analysis paralysis.

Note that these comments reflect the four player experience: I suspect it will play best with two. Like most abstracts, I can imagine playing and enjoying the game often -- but like most abstracts I know it will never hit the table.

Maharani is truly beautiful to view, and for those of us raised when an abstract game meant squares of plastic, this is dazzling.  Gameplay is essentially tactical and driven by which of the four available tiles works best each turn.  Although that makes Maharani family-friendly, in practice it just means that one learns to hate the rondel.

This is a very nice Euro game with excellent components. The rules are simple but very tricky to master them. This is a good game, but people with spatial difficulties should avoid it. You have to be able to rotate the tiles in your mind to identify the best move. If you cannot do this, the game will feel random and will be a disappointment.

RATING: 6
No need to mince words around: Maharani is dry and themeless as they come, not surprising since this is a Euro game in the tile laying genre. Players draw tiles from a rotating tray and place tiles around 4 palace quadrants scoring points for contiguous tiles with similar colors and also for meeples that occupy the tiles. As meeples are scored once during placement and once again when each quadrant is completed, setting up meeples to score in multiple quadrants should be the winning strategy. In fact, similar-colored tile scoring is quite low and the bulk of the points seem to come during end-of-quadrant scoring. Thus, swiftly completing a quadrant to get back your meeples so that they can be placed in other unfinished quadrants is a huge boon.
   There is nothing wrong per se with this game. There is very little strategy in this game and it is mostly tactics. You cannot predict if a tile you want will still be available when it gets back to you. The luck of the draw is quite tremendous but this is also to be expected with many tile laying games. Overall Maharani is a game that struggles to shine in a crowded field of tile laying games and the BGG ratings accurately reflect that reality.

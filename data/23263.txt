We played the 1st case with 3 people. We moved, consulted the butler or looked at a card or note, and then suggested. Yes, we did 3 things, not 2. We had a blast.

Probably the most fun variant of Clue.
Has fair replay value until you've played all the mysteries.

The DVD gives the game a welcome atmosphere. The inspector's notes, the hidden items in rooms, the tunnels, the Butler's commentary etc. are a welcome addition to this old game. This is the only version of Cluedo I can be bothered to play. I wish they would release 10 more stories.

Box is solid but shows some very obvious shelf wear, esp. on edges.  Contents are complete and in good condition.  Pad is still nearly complete (looks as if only 6 pages have been removed).  No scratches on DVD.  Cards are crisp.  **Traded away to BGG user (+Scotland Yard and Mission Command: Sea) for Frag: Gold and Frag: Deadlands.

An interesting twist on the standard Clue game.  The only issue is that there are a limited number of pre-programmed games.  Apparently isn't compatible with some DVD players.

Wow, what an incredible upgrade to the game of Clue.  Parker Brothers should package this board without the DVD as the new, definitive release of Clue.

The real treat here are the ten specific cases that are on the DVD.  This uses the built-in clue board features, except the crime elements have been pre-determined.  As you play through the scenario, certain elements are revealed through the DVD at random intervals which narrow down the field and actually start building the case.  You play with the traditional Clue elements for deduction purposes, but there are now four elements to the crime instead of three ("time" has been added), and are no longer forced to name the room as part of the accusation.  Furthermore, you can actually narrow down some of the choices significantly by piecing together the mystery as it progresses on the DVD.  There are also a ton of other interactive elements, and having played some games with poor or average video-to-board interactive elements, I have to say Clue is levels above its competitors.

After you run out of cases (10 in total), you can still revert to the traditional "Clue" board game with DVD for some special events.  Or, you can even play without the DVD for a much superior version of the traditional Clue!  Why?  Now there are NO FRICKIN' DICE!  Every turn you just choose to move to an adjacent room and make an accusation.  No dice makes Clue a much snappier game, and even with extra suspects/locations/items, it speeds the game up nicely from the original so it's now a much more comfortable length.  Time is now focused on the fun part of Clue (deducting and guessing) as opposed to the dull part (wandering around rolling the die).

I guess I should also mention that the new miniatures they have added are just sensational.  The board has definitely been upgraded in quality.  Oh, and did I mention no frickin' dice?

I rated the original Clue a "5" (since downgraded).  Even if you weren't crazy about Clue, you should enjoy Clue: The DVD Game.  It literally replaces everything I didn't like about the original.  Sensational family game, and I would be shocked if your hardcore gaming buddies didn't enjoy cracking the pre-made cases at the very least.

RATING: 5.5
Seems like a decent twist on classic Clue based on scenario #1 of 12 (Monte Carlo Affair).  My rating is 5.5 instead of 6.0 because it would probably get boring once you have played each of the 12 DVD-based scenarios (at which point you are supposed to play the game without the DVD and without the time-of-day clue cards, essentially reverting the game to classic Clue).  There are two big improvements, though... (1) you don't have to roll to move and (2) you don't get moved around the board when someone implicates your person in the crime.

In scenario #1, I like the way that the clue cards act as a game timer (by which players could be eliminated); thus players should pick up a few item cards from the butler.  Unfortunately, the DVD rushes the game along at a certain point by REPEATEDLY forcing everyone to reveal one of their clue cards once the scenario-specific DVD items have finished (i.e. the game progressing at a slow pace).

If you use the included DVD, [b]Clue DVD Game[/b] is much better than the original [i]Clue[/i].  There are more suspects, locations, and items from which to choose, as well a time of day category. But this time you trying to solve the theft of an item, not the murder of Mr. Body.  There are 12 cases to solve, with which extra clues about the case are played throughout the game on the DVD.  It works really well and is actually quite fun.

However, without the DVD, it plays almost exactly like the original.

Finally, a DVD game that actually enhances board game play! This souped-up version of Clue takes everything good about the deduction part of Clue and adds some fun & urgency to the proceedings. It also, oddly enough, reduces the amount of luck in the game.

A more deducing strategem of Clue.  Less luck than the regular board game which is a good thing.  However, only 10 cases are on the DVD.  The General Case which is random is actually more like the boardgame.

The game play is better than the old version and I really prefer it over the old one but I am not a fan of most DVD type games. This is probably due to the location of the TV relative to our coffee table. It's not comfortable enough for me to suggest playing this.

I have a soft spot for Clue in general which i played the mess of as a kid, but as i grew older learned was flawed with the roll and move aspect. This solves that problem and presents a fun DVD case of deduction for the players. Only thing preventing a higher rating is after you play the 10 cases there is zero replayability

Runs a little long but is, for the most part, a fun diversion. It's a more complicated version of clue that can take a bit of getting used to. Once you figure out some of the new quirks, though, the same basic strategies from "Clue" work in this one. I like it about as much as the original clue.

Old school game of deduction. The DVD adds a story line and further clues improving the original game. Biggest negative is the winner is the person who takes the best notes and a few games have ended in a race for the accusation room. Suggested house rule of a fixed movement point allowance of 7 to avoid bad dice throws.

Reduced it's score to 7 because if everyone makes the same notes it's a race to get to the room you make the final statement. At least the DVD story line adds some variety over the vanilla game though.

RATING: 6
I was surprised, that this DVD-edition actually put something new into this old classic. The new fourth card type (when IT happened) is a nice bonus and if you just play the regular version of Cluedo, the extra card type makes things a little harder (which is good). When you play one of the stories, it's much harder to work out the stolen thing and in many cases you just need luck to get it right. I'm not sure if that works that well, but in the end: every player is in a same line. I think DVD-cluedo is fun to play, but the biggest issue is, that it takes more time than the basic boardgame version - that's a big minus! BUT STILL, if I ever play Cluedo, I'll prefer this over the classic edition.

I thought Clue FX would be the pinnacle of the Clue experience, but this is a deductive masterpiece and makes good use of the DVD format to really add something to it beyond a gimmick.  Only problems so far would be the ten cases (plus the random ones, but the ten cases are the real highlight - they're worth it for the endings alone) and the inspector's notes are a little obvious even before the decoder is used.  Updated ranking after second case - game was even better the next time and the climax leading to the accusation was a real nail-biter between the players.  This is my definitive Clue experience.

Good twist on the classic Clue formula.  The 10 preset stories add some narrative and are definitely worth playing.  The generic mystery adds more variables for a slightly more complex version of the classic.  Picked up at a thrift store for $4.  If you don't have a version of Clue, this is definitely the one to get.

Only played 1 case so far,but I liked it.
It worked the same as the other clue games and very different at the same time. The dvd brought other things to do and a little more fun to the game.
I think if your going to play Clue this should be the one to play,I know I probably won't play the standard Clue game again after playing this.
I didn't like the crime was theft instead of murder but people are still getting hit over the head,just not dying I guess.lol. Bottom Line, Good Game!

The best Clue game I played, very fun and quite tense in the endgame: it really needs deduction to solve the cases. The only flaw is in the limited number of cases... ten cases are not so many, but the 'special'/endless case is alone better than the old Clue. Components are good (but the videos' graphics are a bit poor and the italian dubbing so and so...).

This is pretty good for a mass market game.  It's a bit more interesting in that they've increased the possibilities.  Unforunately, there is a limited number of cases, based on these new possibilities.  And the random cases tell you to ignore the times to create them.  I haven't goofed off with the game enough to know if it's possible to use the new sets of data to play a game of clue similar to the original which will increase the number of possibilities.

This is a surprisingly fun game!  It is Clue, but you are trying to figure out what item, who did it, when they did it, and where.  The great thing about it is the clues the DVD gives you.  Such as the butler telling you that the item was discovered missing after a certain time (so you know that the time has to be before that).  Or some certain group of people were together at certain times or in certain places.  It is a very worth while variant of Clue.

If you like the original Clue, I think you will love this game.  There are 10 different cases included in the game, and outside of those 10 there is not a ton of replay value.  If you let enough time pass, I am sure you will forget enough.  

With changes in technology I am sure I will never play this game again, and it will only get more and more difficult for people to play. But even so I still rate this game above average.

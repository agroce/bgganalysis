RATING: 7
Easy-to-learn, but intense, partnership bidding and trick taking game.  This game and Rook are really good ways to learn about games of this type.  Spades has gobs and gobs of house rules that people usually use.  I prefer Euchre as a partnership game because its easier to keep your partner happy.

It's like Hearts, but you have to name how many tricks you will take.  Therefore, the rating for Spades is like that for Hearts, except one less.

RATING: 8
My favorite traditional cardgame, when played with

1) sandbags
2) proper nil scoring/passing (restrictive enough that they don't reward bad play)
3) good players.

It's not so deep that it loses the "semi-automatic" appeal of card games, but it has plenty of bidding strategy, partner-communication, and trick-taking tactics.  I'm sure that bridge is better, but the investment to learn to play ok is too high for me.  Good times, in college.

RATING: 7.5
Regular Spades is OK, but I particularly enjoy a variant of Spades with 'nil' and a rule called 'Low 50'.  Low 50 is like 'nil', but you can give 2 cards to your partner and get 2 in return.  The end result is a more dynamic gamer where most players are more actively playing each hand.

This is the best (standard deck) card game I’ve played but admittedly I haven’t played many of the top card games rated here on the Geek. This is a partnership, trick taking and bidding game that works very well and is simple enough to teach the older members of your family. My girlfriend and me played this against my parents nearly every weekend for months. Definitely some skill involved as we rarely got beaten. 

Update: I've now played Wizard, it's a bit like Spades but it's played individually. Wizard has now taken Spades' place as my family's choice card game. I don't know which I like better. Maybe after a few more plays I'll come back and decide.

[i]Posted: 7/27/09, Rated: 10[/i]

[i]Spades[/i] is for me what [i][gameid=2181][/i] was to my parents.  It kept me from studying in college, and was played countless times on board ship in the Navy.  To say that I've played over 1000 hands is not an exaggeration.

Bidding your hand correctly is of course paramount, but evaluating your competition's bidding styles is also important.  Recognizing play patterns to set up your partner is more satisfying (I think) than playing both hands when you bid a contract in [i][gameid=2181][/i].  And then there are all of the house variants.

Playing with the Big Joker, and the Little Joker.  Saying the deuce is a bigger trump than the Ace.  Ten-for-two.  Nil.  Blind nil.  Blind ten-for-two.  Boston.  So many different, crazy ways to score tons of points.  Here's a [url=http://www.pagat.com/boston/spades.html]good site[/url] that describes these options.

But what really makes this game shine is its agelessness.  Last week we traveled back to Arizona to attend a memorial service.  We stayed with some friends who didn't have a wide selection of games.  We broke out a standard deck of cards, and immediately all fell into a familiar pattern of play even though each team had never played together before.  That's an experience that transcends the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A somewhat basic but fun partnership game. The penalty for going under [i]or over[/i] your bid makes the game fairly tense and a lot of fun. This is my preferred four-player card game if learning/playing Tichu isn't an option, and my favorite standard-deck card game. I use [url=http://www.pagat.com/boston/spades.html#four]these rules[/url]. (2009-03-21)

Spades is most likely my favorite card game, followed by Euchre. Must be played with bags (essential!) and 0 +100/ 00 +200 imo. I would love to try Suicide F2F. I don't play Spades nearly often enough F2F. Hearts is just a crappy game in comparison.

Spades is a decent trick taking partners game (when you are fairly equally skilled as the other players). If you have a bad partner buckle up for some misery. Also a typical game (played to 500 points) can take a really long time and for me, overstays its welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A friend once told me that he thinks that this is broken as one can go "nil" just about every hand and make it.  I'm not sure that that is quite correct, but going nil is quite powerful.  Not powerful enough to prevent me from playing.  It's a nice game of card tracking, card communicating, and card play with very simple bidding.

RATING: 5
While I like trick taking games in general fairly well, I'm not a big fan of ones where you have to "bid" on how many tricks you will win, especially in ones like spades where the downside is far greater than the upside, causing bids to stay in a relatively safe range that adds no tension.

So, it ends up boiling down to "who was dealt a high hand", since that's what bids, and thus points, boil down to.

Still a decent game for a more social card game, but not on my personal radar when it comes time to play a trick-taking game.

RATING: 10
Pure delight. Memory skills, teamwork, and bluffing all come together perfectly in Spades. I played this game exclusively for over 3 years, often 4-5 days a week and still love it. I haven't played this regularly in years, but never turn down a game when the chance presents itself. The only weakness of this game is the need to know your partner well, and the difficulty in  finding others to play with who like to play your particular variety of Spades; as many alternative scoring and rule systems exist. IMO Sandbags are an essential rule, while the additional trumps (big, little, deuce of Spades) and blind bids to catch up (blind 6 before seeing cards, score 120 if you make it, no sandbags on blind hands) are not though I always lobby for them. Passes and nulls are the devil and I dislike playing with them. 

These are my preferred rules:
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/18587/spades-played-kalamazoo-circa-2000

Strangely, I still think one of my favourite parts of this game is the inevitable post-mortem analysis that occurs after every hand is played out where you can playfully rib your partner for a terrible play, mock the competition for a gaffe, or otherwise keep the atmosphere fun and spirited. A game I enjoy largely because it is both mentally stimulating and automatic at the same time due to repetition. Many of my friends and I have logged hundreds of games (not hands...games...) of this, so the actual in game play is fairly straight forward, but there are just enough nuances to keep you on your toes and involved.

As a kid, before knowing the real rules to the game, we used to sit around and take turns flipping the top card of a deck of cards, if it was a spade, you yelled out "spades!". This version was not terribly interesting.

I had since played the game a few times as an adult and once or twice on an older computer that came with the game. It is a trick taking game and really no better or worse than many of the modern hobbyist ones (ie. Tichu). It doesn't have any gimmicks and works, it just is not terribly engaging once you know there is a world of more refined games out there.

[countless plays before 2005; 5 since] This was one of the two favorite card games of my youth.  I haven't played much in years, but lately have had the chance to revisit it a bit.  Much of the Spades of my youth was 3-handed cutthroat, so it's been interesting to get into the partnership game more.  What's more annoying than interesting to me is the variety of rules different people play with.  I suppose that's going to happen with any traditional card game, though.  Last time we tried playing dealer's choice, and that was pretty good.

I think Spades is a great game, and as solid and tight as a trump & trick game can be.  I prefer Hearts, only because there are more "special" cards in the latter, whereas I feel like in Spades you hope you have lots of spades or at least high cards, and that's it.

I have a hard time finding people who don't know how to play spades (but I don't mind teaching...just don't want them for a partner) and everyone seems to have their own variant.  Me, I enjoy spades straight up.  I remeber one time in boot camp me and some guys in my platoon were so bored, that we made up some tiny cards on quarters of 3x5 cards and played spades until our drill sergeant would walk into our bay.  We hide our cards in our pants and as soon as the coast was clear, would sit back down and resume play.  Good times...uncommonly good card game.

The best trick taking game short of bridge.  I bet I've played thousands of hours of this game.  But leave out the card passing - that's Hearts not Spades.

RATING: 6
A good game, but I'd rather be able to bid for the privilege of naming trump.  It's much better than Hearts and Euchre, though.  Spades is a very good introduction to the more advanced trick-taking games.

Probably my favorite game with a standard deck of cards.  I haven't played in years, though.  Most memorable game was when my team was down over a thousand points and the other was something like minus 500, and my team tried to go double blind nil, and we succeeded!  Never have been able to do that again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This card game is my all-time favorite with cards.  As such, I would always be willing to play it, and given a pack of cards and similar level players will always suggest it.  

The highlights are: it is interraciteve (team playing of course) and has high variability (cards, duh!).  The game can be played on a high level, (sandbagging rules and competitive bidding) as well as socially.  It can be scaled to 3 or 5, but is best with 4.  It is fairly quick, and the rules are fairly simple to learn.

Downside is that, at a cognitive level, this game needs a knowledge of probablility.  As a pure card game, it does not qualify as "boardgame" material, and the only visual factor is playing with a higher end deck...

RATING: 7
I believe I've played before Jan 2nd, 2008, however it's been years (college) and I'm not certain? It can be taught in about 5min for those savy trick takers out there. Going to 500 take take a bit over an hour (played as 4 player). It's played with a standard deck of cards and you guessed it, the spades are trump. Dealer passes out 13 cards to each and the person to the left is the first to bid. Each player bids what he thinks he will take of the 13 tricks. You play with the person accross the table as your partner. You both need to take your combine score, not the individual bid you made. You score 10 times your bid, plus any overs. For example: bid 6, take 7, get 61 points. If you miss your bid, you simply get -60 bidding 6. Players may also go "Nil" which means that they if they don't take any tricks individually, your team gets 100 points. Be careful in bidding Nil since if you take one trick, you get -100. I'd highly recommend giving this a game play and consideration in playing every once in a while.

RATING: 10
Nov08: It's about time I go back and give this game some love.  I've played this 100s of times without recording it.  Why do I like it?

A. Partnership games are great.
B. Nil bids add high tension.
C. It finishes in just the right amount of time.
D. Great balance of skill and luck.
E. Many meaningful decisions during bidding and play.
F. Having Spades always be trump still allows for the occasional hand of awesome sauce.

So yea, there's plenty of new-fangled trick taking games.  And bridge is always there as a career if you're done gaming, but Spades is still the sweet spot for me.

Description: The classic trick-taking card game.

Con: No theme. No special cards or complexity.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2010)

It’s been close to 3 years since I last played this. At the time I really liked it. I want to play it again soon to properly rate and comment. For now, I can say that I love trick taking games and partnership games. At that time (2010), I didn’t pay attention to my ratings. For me, Spades is now a 6.0. A game I would like to play from time to time.

Interesting partnership card game. Lots and lots of variants to sort through. Sandbagging is necessary but nil and blind bids may not be. Note that there's no reason to multiply everything by 10 as long as you keep track of sandbags separately and deduct 9 or 10 points for 10 bags; you can still use them as a tiebreaker if needed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
It's pretty simple, which in and of itself is not a bad thing. The betting is interesting. But with the betting comes the possibility of negative points in the 10s to the 100s, and that extends the game. The game I played felt like it would never end because everybody kept taking penalties. I like [thing=215][/thing] better. Both games have partners, betting, and a points threshold endgame condition. But in Tichu the betting is only once in a while, by choice, so you feel like you're getting somewhere.

Played the heck out of this in college.  One of the best trick taking games with a standard deck.  I prefer this over Euchre (especially since it seems to be fairly rare to find Euchre players that can resist cheating).  It has a good deal of strategy that doesn't become apparent for a number of plays.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find anyone willing to play enough to become good at it since I left school.  One of those games I'd play far more if I had the people to play with.

With less time, I'm probably fine with Hearts. That said, I'd be happy to give this another go with an interested group.

This surprisingly meaty little card game has been around since the 1930s but I just recently discovered it.  My co-workers like to play a version of "Oh Hell" where you bid for number of tricks you will take each round. I wanted to find something similar but more strategic and Spades was the answer. The partnership aspect is interesting as is bidding Nil or Blind Nil. Also the "bags" rule forces you to be more precise in your bidding or pay a big penalty.

Great game. I think I prefer it over Euchre. Love to take those bags to force the set. Just tends to go a little long, especially how we play, what with getting set and missing nil bids all the time.

A trick taking - simplified bidding card game. I guess I prefer the old game Whist where the trumps are set by the deal and is not always spades, and bridge which has a more interest in trying to set the bids.

RATING: 10
I'm a big fan of trick games and this rates as my favorite.  This is not only my favorite card game, but my favorite game of any kind.  All cards are dealt, so there is no doubt as to what might be hidden in the deck.  Therefore, you can plan and adjust your game even as the hand is being played.

You also have endless options as to how to initially bid your hand.  You can bid low and try to give your opponents sandbags, or you can try to sucker your opponents into a high bid so that you can set them.  You can bid Nil on the same hand that you might bid 4 on.  Your choices in this game are limitless, and if you get a bad hand, you'll be dealt another one in two minutes.

The game plays fast.  The more you play it, the more you understand it, and the more you want to play it.  Addictive if you find the right group.  Would play anytime!

Spades is one of my favorite traditional card games (hearts is good as well).  Easily taught, and the "team" aspect is fun.

RATING: 7
Fun trick taking game - the only real problem with Spades is that no one plays it the same.  Inevitably you have ten minutes of rules negotiations before the game starts about how you play the game, and then someone is left playing a way they're not used to, etc.  Nevertheless, fun bidding and trick taking game.

nostalgia. the adults played this at every holiday except Christmas. eventually i was allowed in and i relished the competition and thought behind each play. one of my uncles would read your entire hand by what you'd played and i think dad did the same, but rarely confirming it out loud. when i played card and board games with anyone else there was never this same feeling. all other games were so chaotic and frustrating (at least, until i found Civ games on computer)! it wasn't until part way through college that i began discovering board games again and finding like-minded players that i realized how much i'd been missing out on. now, Spades is the game i judge other games by. some hidden information, but quickly becoming known information; cards with special powers, but few of them; misplaying a card could help your opponent, but sometimes you can scrounge up an incredible trade; full player engagement with low down-time; bets and bags...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favorite trick-taking game, Spades is very quick and easy to play, considerably more than Bridge or its other, fancier cousins.  Bidding for the amount of tricks you'll take is fun and allows you to slide between strategic planning and all-out bluffing.  It has the trick-taking tactics of Euchre, but spread out over the full 13 tricks, which allows for strategy as well.  

I love that Spades is played in partnerships, which adds some very subtle tweaks to the gameplay.  You and your partner cannot openly discuss strategy, but when two players fall into a groove anticipating each other's moves, covering each other's over-bids, protecting their nil bids, etc, that's when the game really sings for me.  

It has all the dryness of a traditional card game, but I love Spades, and will almost always be willing to bust out a game.

Not a bad simple (rules wise) trick taking game for four players - prefer Doppelkopf with four or Skat with three for trick taking games though. Even better, Mü with five and Sticheln with six. Spades is kind of your old vanilla trick taking game and in recent times so better examples have been developed.

[b]In Standard 52-Card Deck[/b]

A more complex variation of [b]Hearts[/b] that serves as a great way to introduce the concepts of "bidding", "partnership", and "trump suit" of trick-taking games.

Love it! One of my favorite standard-deck card games!

  A more accessable, easyer to score, "low cost", Bridge.  We played this to death when I was in the service and now when we go camping.  Easy to teach, fun, anyone can play, and with a good partner, an outstanding game.  I'll play this to the end of my days, my number one card game.

RATING: 4
My introduction to trumps and teamwork card games. I have a soft spot for this, since the rules are (relatively) simple, and it hasn't been ruined/screwed up for beginners by bidding conventions (Bridge). There are superior Chinese card games, and Bridge, bidding conventions aside, is also superior, but nothing beats Spades when it comes to getting into a 2v2 card game quickly (don't need to look up the rules and/or keep correcting confused newbies).

This is one of my all time favorite trick taking games, although I did not really get into it until college.  Strangely, despite its seemingly universal popularity, I did not own a card game rule book that contained rules to it for a long time.  I actually purchased a packaged Spades game just to see the rules.  It allowed a person bidding Blind Nil to pass 3 cards.  We only played that once, as it was much too easy.  At any rate, I've seen many variations over the years.  The most strategic game seems to be a standard pack, no jokers, minimum bid of four, 10 sandbags = -100, doubling your bid = -100, nil bid (alone) is worth 100 (no passing), blind nil only if behind by 200 for 200 (may pass one card), and play to 1000.  My wife and I met playing this game.

Partnership card games are usually very good, and this one is no exception. A cross between Oh Hell and Tichu.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Spades is an easy, enjoyable public domain card game. It's also a good way to introduce people to more advanced trick-taking games like  Bridge. Variants with more than four players tend to be unbalanced as it is too easy to go nil. For a precise bidding game that can hold up to six players, try Wizard instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An old standby, one that if you get the cards then you win and if you don't it doesn't matter how good a player you are.  But it is still a pleasant diversion and a good partnership game.  I still play it semi-regularly, despite all these other cool games so it can't be all bad, right?

I used to play Spades a bit in college, but now my wife and our cohort do not play at all.  This rating has dropped considerably since my introduction to Bridge, from a 9.5 to a 6.5 -- Spades is like Bridge's younger brother.  So much more tension in Bridge... if only the scoring weren't so mucky.

RATING: 10
IMHO the BEST trick-taking card game, and one of the greatest overall card games, ever created. If this game were themed and introduced within the last 10 years, it probably would be rated well over 8.0 here on BGG. I've played them all - from traditional games (Hearts, Bridge, Pinochel, Euchre, Skat) to the modern ones favored on BGG (Tichu, Mu) - and nothing comes close.  Spades has it all:  perfect blend of skill and luck, tactics and strategy.  Can be enjoyed by newcomers and seasoned veterans. Strength of dealt hands can give newcomers a chance to win a hand or two, but skilled/knowledgeable players will win 80-90% of games played. Incredible in-game tension, score-dependent changes in tactics, even rewards making changes in tactics mid-hand much like a quarterback calling an audible.  Playing with  the 'bags' option in combination with the nil-bid option makes for exceptionally rewarding and exciting game play.

Great game.  Rating has gone down simply on willingness to play with all the other great games around.

Double Nil variant has worn out its welcome.

I just don't care for spades.   Especially something as light as sapdes.  Give me hearts, give me barbu, give me oh hell! anything besides spades.  About as good as UNO.  Well actually I'd rather play UNO with a partner.  The game doesn't have any mechanisms that forces change.  I think I'm more partial to avoiding tricks than taking them.  Bid and take tricks.... I have to say it, Spades is a one trick pony.

I'm not sure I like this one as much as some other trick takers with bidding and trump.  Euchre and Sheepshead come to mind.

Meh.  I don't really like trick-taking games, for the most part.  Not quite popular enough to make it a game to play when I don't want to teach something to nongamers, and not deep enough to make me really want to try it if I could play a boardgame instead.  Pretty much any time that it's appropriate to play this game, I'll play [gameid=6887] instead.

This is my favorite trick-taking game - it's Bridge without all the overly complicated rules and pointless memorization, and it's much friendlier than Hearts since you have a partner and no spawn-of-satan Queen of Spades card.

Oddly enough, the digital version killed any interest I had in the boardgame. The critical decision is related to declining and timing that. With that in mind, the digital game gets a 6 since it plays so much faster, while having to fiddle with the board components drops this to a 4 or a 3.

I really do like Small World, quite a lot actually.  The problem is the expansions.  I have a problem when it comes to boardgames.  I am a completionist.  I like to have all of the promos, expansions, extras, etc that are available and Small World just has so much that it gets tedious tracking it all down.  If you aren't like me and can enjoy a game just for what it is without worrying about having everything then there will be almost no barrier to entry and it will be a very fun game.  I like to call it fantasy euro Risk.

Inferior to Vinci. Only mountains have special rules now, which takes away most tactical decisions about which provinces to conquer and which to abandon. Hidden scoring means you're not sure you're attacking the leader. The board is cluttered, and the decline tokens look the same for every race. I'm usually a big fan of theme, but not at the expense of playability.

I like the production a lot and I like the concept a lot but its not coming together for me in the gameplay....I've tried it few more times and here's a quote from someone else about another game that nails it for me 

Al Johnson wrote: "Just feels dry and not my cup of tea.  I still admire the mechanics and all and would play if a friend really wanted to." I think its an innovative game (well, I guess the [thing=60][/thing] system) but it just doesn't produce the experience one might expect from such a silly theme!

[i]tl;dr: Small World may not offer a deep, agonizingly strategic decision space, but it is loads of fun to clash with your friends on a tiny map. This game has provoked a lot of negotiation, arguments, and enjoyment every time we've played it. I'm a fan.[/i]

I like to think of Small World as a great hybrid between Risk and Catan rolled into one game that's really unique on its own. In Smallworld, you control a civilization on a board that's just too small to fit all the players. You must leverage your special ability and your race powers to go into decline at the proper time, unleashing a whole new race on the board. For glory! Each round, you collect victory points for the territories you control. After 9 rounds (in the 4-player), the player with the most victory points wins. 

I love the unpredictability of deciding when to go into decline: it makes for a great mechanic and can really upset the power balance significantly. Players who grab a good race/ability combo can upset the game, and all your decisions are affected by the fact that the board is just too small for everyone, and you will end up clashing with the other civilizations. 

One of the most unique things about this game is that it features four different game boards: a 2-player, 3-player, 4-player, and 5-player configuration. Not only does this mean that the map won't get familiar for a while, but it ensures that players are always bumping elbows, even in 2-player games. Additionally, we have the Realms expansion, which gives us a modular board for any number of players, as well as several scenarios to play through.

I'm looking forward to getting it to the table a lot at our game group, as well as learning all the different races and abilities. I can see this being our standard area-control game.

Someone once described this to me as "Risk on steroids." Sure. I think that might suffice. You make armies, put them in regions. If you outnumber opponents, you win. There's luck involved with one of the battles, but mostly it's just your planning that counts. However, the armies are not created equal. Every army is unique with abilities and is combined randomly with a different effect. For example, giants get bonuses for attacking from mountains. If they happen to be flying giants, they can fly to all the mountains to mount attacks. Game strategy revolves around both picking armies that fit your style, then knowing when to abandon them to the un-mercies of the enemy and back a new, fresh civilization.

Despite its complexities, with an experienced player, new players can pick up the game in minutes. In about 10 minutes I had two boys about age 10 playing decently with me.

I played this one and found it to be alright. Very ponderous though - perhaps it flows better if you know all the races and powers well. It reminded me of Kingdom Builder in it's variety, but KB is way smoother, faster and, for my money, more fun (albeit also a lot less thematic).

Das Spiel ist mein Top Favorit! Wer schon Vinci zu schätzen wußte, der wird dieses Spiel bestimmt auch mögen. Die Mechanismen sind sehr ähnlich, mit ein paar wenigen Änderrungen. Die grafische Aufmachung ist aber um ein vielfaches besser. Als Genre ist hier Fantasy angesagt und man kann das hier auch richtig nachvollziehen. Gelungene Umsetzung und ich muss das Ding haben. Mal sehen ob man das noch günstiger als auf der Messe bekommt ;-) Aber vor den Erweiterungen schrecke ich zurück. Die sind mir echt zu teuer. 8 Euro für 5 Kärtchen ? Hallo ? Ne warten bis die unter 5 Euro kosten, die bringen nicht wirklich neues.
Bei 5 Spielern sind mir etwas zuwenig Karten da. Deshalb nur eine 9.

A beautiful produced game that goes out of its way to poke fun at the cliche nature of its theme is something I can plant a flag on. However, if you plant that flag in your neighbors realm... don't plan on winning any time soon. The small thing I can't get past is that the game promotes player interaction and conflict, but if you do just that you are probably going to lose. More often than not, the game is won by those who sit back and watch their friends tear each other apart.

My first play was truly stressful - and not in a particularly good way. I was teaching the game to my kids and my nephew - a four player game of newbies. We suffered through some AP, but even so, the game played in about 45 minutes. My second play was better, but there seems to be some noticeable imbalances to the game: first player has an advantage and sorcerer is powerful. Subsequent plays - now it's becoming more strategic, more interesting decisions, better play of certain race combinations. The game is improving - and so is my rating.

Area control with a very laid back attitude. Quality components.

Update 5/2010:
This game could be even better, but that would require a couple of races more. You just see the same races too often.

Small World brings you tough decisions every round packed into a streamlined experience with good looks. Rules are fairly simple but the possible combinations in the game are many keeping things fresh for countless of plays. I also have to admire the looks of the game. Small World features a rich colour palette with a lot of detailed cartoon art. But still the board does not look busy and all information is easily available at one look.

It is obvious that the game has been derived from Vinci, and in principle they play exactly the same. There are a few changes to Small World that, at least in my book, have cut off some of the unnecessary complexity and made the experience more pleasant.

Changes affecting tactics:
1) In Small World you no longer have a need to control regions connected to each other. This is one less restriction to worry about.

2) You may now establish a contact with your active and declined race. Yet another restriction you do not have to worry about any more.

---

Changes affecting amount of information:
3) When you send a race into decline you do not pick your next race on the same round anymore. Thus you are not giving any extra information to the other players so that they could prepare before your next invasion.

4) Small World has hidden scoring which I find great. Of course one could argue that scores could be tracked and thus the game should be played with open scores. However, I do not buy that argument. This memory element is there for a reason and that is to create surprises at the end game when you cannot be certain who is leading. Over the course of the game there are just too many events changing the scores up and down so that it is very difficult to track everything. If someone is capable of tracking the scores, I do not find it unfair. People are different and I see no reason to mitigate the gifts somebody has. 

---

Changes in components and playability:
5) The number of tokens each race receives is now printed directly on the race and ability tiles. You just sum up the two numbers. No need to remember variables that depend on the number of players.

6) All regions have the same base cost for conquering. Moreover, Small World includes tokens for regions that have an extra cost. This is nice, because you just have to sum up the number of cardboard and add it to the base cost. This makes it easier to calculate everything correctly because there are fewer rules to remember. This has a downside, though. More cardboard means a bigger mess.

7) While the aforementioned six changes are positive ones there is one big negative. Instead of utilising two sided discs in player colour to represent the active and declined race tokens on the board, Small World sports unique race tokens for each individual race. Not only makes this harder to follow who owns which region, it makes the setup, and especially the clean up a real pain in the ass. You have myriad of tokens everywhere and keeping everything in order is a chore.

Anyways, Small World is a great game that plays relatively fast and scales up and down well with the the player number. However, I strongly suggest getting at least one or two expansions to keep the things fresh. The downside of this is that you have more cardboard to keep in order. May the gods help you if you happen to accidentally flip the box over and scatter all the tokens across the room.

I have lost every time I have played this game – and I don't care because playing the different combinations are just so much fun! The variety that can occur is amazing! And it is humbling to see your unstoppable army defeated by a combination you thought was sure to suck because that person just happened to have the right lands for it. Oh, the madcap fun! 

Granted, the reason I always lose is because I don't kill my races off fast enough – I hold on too long (oh my precious races!) and the game is all about knowing when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em when it comes to your races. But despite my character flaw in holding on too long, I still love playing this game.

I did play this game where I killed off my races at a good rate - the only reason I didn't win was because the first player got such an amazing lead on the rest of us that it was impossible to catch up.  But the game was still fun.  And that was the first time I had ever played without the maximum number of people.

A perfect "re-imagining". The concepts and setting for the game are absolutely perfect (especially the adjective-race combinations) and this is an extremely well crafted game with no extra "fat". Just the right length & depth.

My personal preference is that the direct conflict multiplayer games are a bit too irritating - I don't enjoy the feeling of having my plans interfered with so dramatically on the whims of the wind - the winning or losing is arbitrary, but since the length is short and as long as you go into it knowing what to expect, it is an absolute blast.

Very mixed feelings about this one.  The gameplay, the very idea of Small World, just seems wrong and stoopid.  Eventually it dawns on you that the players are like these detached gods who care little for the affairs of the races on the boards except to maximize their production.  That's just plain wrong -- why anyone would develop that concept into a game scares the crap out of me for humanity.  

And yet....the game itself isn't bad.  

So I'm very conflicted on this one.  I think the concept, the mechanics, and even the artwork are all problematic....but the gameplay can still be interesting and even fun.  But I have zero interest in any expansions or re-implementations.

Light area control game with a splash of theme.
The good:
-Easily accessible to wide range of people
-Healthy player interaction
-Flying zombies, how cool is that
The bad:
-2 and 3 player games seem to come down to how the races lay, and after a couple plays it's pretty obvious what combos to pick for a 2-3 player game.
-4 and 5 player games tend to get killed with an AP prone person. 
-The sad thing is that even in 4 to 5 player games the most interesting choices are when to go into decline and picking the new races. Where to conquer is usually an easy decision to make. In my opinion if a game is going to be replayable there has to be interesting decisions more often than Small World gives them.

From the Reviews: The fantasy game is just not for me, there is something inside of me that wants to stay away for the fantasy of it. The game looks good though, plays 2-5 in a little over an hour and the "war-like" mechanic is something I think I would enjoy. Vinci is more my style, a little more dry and "realistic". I guess when it comes down to it, I look down my nose at games with lots of fantasy. But that is not to say that I do not enjoy fiction.
The art is something that I know my wife would discredit, and thus never play. Also the theme and art are something I would like to encourage my children to avoid.

RATING: 6
The changes from Vinci are not entirely successful and some fail, reminding us why they are present in the other game.

The winner is often easily predictable, sometimes halfway through a game.

Ditching the adjacency/cohesion rules of Vinci allows a player to take over the board, and ultimately win.

The die can be too influential.

The range of power of Race-Special Ability combinations, from weak to strong, is too great, and their actual power may vary further depending on a myriad of factors, especially board position at the moment a race enters. Most are strong, at least to some degree, but several are too weak.

Some of the quantities in the game appear to be questionable at best. Merchants with two men, and putting only one money on passed-over combinations, are particular examples.

The Stout Special Power is strongly associated with the eventual winner, very probably because it effectively gives that player an extra turn.

The artwork is not always what it could have been.

It is hard to rate or to recommend this game as it can be good, but it sometimes starts good and ends poorly. It requires a little more work.

Another game that is hit or miss.  Although the vast majority seem to love this game and for good reason.  It's a brilliant introductory territory game.  Wonderful fantasy theme and lots, perhaps too much, eye candy on the board.  It's not as lucky as some think.  There's a LOT of diplomacy in this game.  You won't win a multiplayer games by doing your own thing.  You have to talk to people. Get them to attack other people while making yourself appear to be less of threat.  This is important on the board as well.  Don't pick the highest scoring faction, pick the one which will encourage players to attack others.  This is very true early on, where a high score can establish a player as a leader who then gets attacked throughout the game.  Better to stay in second and score around 10 coins consistently than pull a big round for 14 coins and get ganged up on. 

For those that don't like the fantasy or hidden scoring, I'd highly recommend Vinci with some custom maps.  Or, don't play with hidden scoring.  Makes the game far less random.

nice little filler, but just that. I played like ten times, and begin to learn the finer lines of slow and fast races...
however, I think a major part of winning the game is making the others believe that you do worse than you do, and that is so unrelated to the playing that it removes the fun.

Vinci with the rules clarified.  I approve very much of the simplified method for calculating the difficulty of attacking a tile (2 plus the number of tokens, no matter what kind).  Since you have to make these calculations constantly over the course of the game, I'm glad to see how much faster it has been made.

I enjoy this one.

Alright, this will get me a remark from the Other Player about how I'm too picky about my board games. Which ... might actually be true. But if there is One Fault in board games which might ruin them for me, it is that they are TOO LONG. And Small World drives me mad with its weird timing. Compared to the simplicity of the rules, it takes ages to explain them. And even though I've played it several times now, I don't have the feeling of developing some kind of understanding of a possible strategy. And then again, I always feel that if I just had the time for ... one ... more ... turn before going into decline, my personal small world would be such a better place.
Apart from that, the amazon(e?)s are cool. And I always wanted to play the skeletons, which I did today, and it was great. So, yeah. Give me a small world every day, but please, let's play half the number of rounds, okay?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is great, but I have one issue. It seems when each player starts on their own side of the board, it gives the impression everyone is working alone to colonize their half of the board. The first person to encroach on someone else's territory seemed to spark some accusations of dislike towards the players. So long as this spark is tendered to a healthy flicker, the game is all in good fun. Let that flicker become a flame and you will end up having people angry at others even after the game has been packed up and set aside. Make sure your group knows all the board game strategies never reflect true-life feelings and that you're MEANT to attack the other players.

We keep the scores hidden so you can't target the leader, so I should just target who I think is the leader instead? (or more likely the one who can talk themselves out of trouble the least) despite the fact scores are trackable if paying attention?

Game is brilliant. Graphics are amazing and especially for me (a girl) the rainbow made a magic! What especially strikes about this game after first plays is the sense of humor, when you are finding Flying Dwarfs or other 'smile causing' pairs. Game played even in 4 is quite fast, however beginners needs to read all the descriptions for the characters, what will slow you done for 2-4 first games, but then - WOW! P.S. Do not play with people who are making advance math, as playing with them in Small World is very demanding ;)  - they know your score before you! :) Sorry Vlad! :P

Played our first game on 12/7/2012. I enjoyed the game, though I thought it went just a _tad_ too long for a game of its depth. Mind you, we were playing 5 player. Since then we have played it four player a couple of times. The game is maybe _slightly_ too long, but we have the rules down now and we all really enjoy it. It's one of our "go to" games.

I need to log my plays more consistently, I've played this a lot.  This game is simple to teach and play, the big complication is the selection of your next race if you're not familiar with the powers.

The combos give a lot of replay and the expansions have only added to that.  I don't rate it higher because I personally prefer more complicated games, but those games are more difficult to get to the table.  This one gets *played* and that's a big point in its favor.

The simplicity of this "war" game, I believe, is what makes this game both great and meh at the same time.  The "combat" system is very easy to understand for non-gamers and each of the numerous factions have a distinct feel which is great.  After several plays, however, I find myself wishing for a deeper combat system.  As an introductory game or a regular game for non-gamers, however, this is great.

Initial rating after playing one 3 player game. Really liked it, and want to get in some more plays with all different amounts of players. But see this being a big-time favorite.

6-12-11 - Another 3 player game, and I still really like the back and forth that this offers. There is a nice balance of when to push your race to the limit, and when to go into decline, as well as making sure you go into decline at the opportune moment to get the next race you need before your opponents!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The problem with Small World is that the game isn't actually about what it looks to be about on the surface.  At first glance the focus appears to be what's happening on the board, but the real decisions of the game revolve around choosing your races from those available and choosing when to send them into decline.  When making actual on-board decisions the best option is usually easy to see.  

But while I feel kind of betrayed by Small World, this deceptive nature is also what makes it work.  It's a light war game that can be played by people who don't like war games because in its heart of hearts it isn't one.  Also, the art's great, and just looking at the game laid out in progress on the table is a pleasurable experience.  It's simple enough to be played by non-gamers, but gamers don't seem to turn up their noses at it.  I'll rarely turn down a game if someone wants to play.

+ The races and abilities that you get to choose are creative, fun, and make for some interesting combinations.
- The actual taking of territories and moving on the board just wasn't all that interesting.


Why it's previously-owned:
For me, this game was just way too whiny and diplomatic when it shouldn't be.  It seemed that in every game, the winner was determined by who would stay out of the grudge matches or would team up with others to knock down one player. 
I traded this one away for Tribune.

A fine game that fits both gamers who game a lot or not too often. The game can be explained in less than 10 minutes yet the strategy and tactics are still very satisfying to figure out. The art too is amazing and the mixing of race and powers do form funny things to roleplay or talk about, such as "Flying Trolls" and such. 
Downside is the board map can feel samey with multiple plays but then you have expansions that can solve that. Overall, a fine game that I would like to play more of.

Our first play took way too much time... we were all still trying to work out what the characters allowed us to do.  I hoped that this would become more fun as play quickens.  However, the fantasy theme is not quite my thing (don't get me wrong, the theme works very well for this game, it's just not my thing).  Also, my sense is that the wide variety of character combinations adds decision-making breadth without depth.  The play through expansion and decline is definitely streamlined; maybe too streamlined.  I wish I could have done more manipulation with a civilization before sending them into decline.  It's not a broken game or a bad game... it's just not a very interesting game.

A reworking of [GAMEID=60].

For some reason, I like [GAMEID=40692] a lot more than [GAMEID=60].  Gameplay is much more visual and intuitive.  Stacking cardboard means not having to remember some of the nuances.  The graphics are vastly improved.  The game feels more fun, though a bit less tactical (not too much less, though).  The different maps for the different number of players makes an inordinate amount of sense.  Ditto for the different race tokens.  There's the potential for more and varied combinations of powers and races.  Keeping the score hidden means lead is by perception, making the game much tighter and more fun.

I really like [GAMEID=40692] and I wouldn't be surprised if I end up picking up a copy.  I hope they release expansions with more races and powers.

I played this game only three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Small World never particularly cought my interest in these first couple of years of gaming. I knew it was a nice gateway game, but it seemed too light for me... Instead I was pleasantly surprized by how much I enjoyed it, when I finally decided to try it. I especially like the system that combines races and traits to create constantly new combinations, which grants really a huge replay value. The rest of the game is also good... the mechanics are very easy, nothing spectacular perhaps but definitively easy to grasp.

Still it's maybe too light for me to own a copy, but I definitively wouldn't mind to play it again, when I will have a chance. Very nice and clever game!

So far played mostly with two, but I enjoyed it. I always liked the idea behind Vinci, but I only played it a few times because the board was hideus, and the game too long and prone to AP.

FAVOURITE GAME - it is a funny and a very competitive area control game. You will choose a race with a special ability at the start of the game, then you start to occupy the territories of Small World very easily getting into combat with your opponents. What counts is that you have the most provinces at the end of your turn, so you can collect taxes which translates into victory points. At one point in the game you may go into decline and choose another race, so you will be able to get your hands on more units to conquer more territories. It is a turn-based game, usually lasting eight rounds. It is good partygame, thanks to it`s easy rules, fast pace and great deal of interaction between the players.

Fun, pretty quick, more strategic than it looks -- not perfect, but very well done.  I like it.  The rulebook is [b]terrible[/b], for no good reason -- unclear rules on powers all over the place.  Fortunately, the game itself is good enough to make us interested in an epic 2-race battle on the 4p board.

After a few more games, the variety seems to diminish, though -- and it becomes a bit more of a calculational Euro with fancy clothes.  Also, 2p, just "take the race with the most tokens" is not a bad rule of thumb, to a slightly unfortunate extent.  "Virtual people" counting modifies it some but not quite enough.

In my company almost noone likes it, it's strange, but understandable though. First of all - this game's art and the quanity of components makes it pleasant to keep, to touch and to look at. It looks massive, though in a gameplay structure it's really simple. To play this game normally and without a ton of help, you need at least one round with babysitting, because the main aspect of knowing, how to play it, is in knowing all the kinds of races and perks, which is not that interesting to learn before playing it. But if you know, how to play it, you will most probably have a nice 2 hour + fun and peaceful match every time you play it. Also, god damn that dice...

RATING: 7.8
The world is too small to accomodate all the races that is present in the game.  Players will have to first choose a race to start with and spread their 'civilisation' and conquer more regions even at the expense of killing and conquering fellow races.  In this way, the players will be able to gain victory points after each round.

Players can also put their races into decline which the population of the race starts to diminish.  By leaving footprints of the race in the board, players can gain victory points passively.  The game is played in a certain number of turns in which the game ends after the last round is played.

Good points:
The game is replayable with the randomness of races and powers that can be chosen.  Players will have to strategise and plan what they are going to do in the following turns to max out their victory points.

Bad points:
The game rely too much on the choosing of race and powers.  Once a player chose a correct race with a correct combined power, the battle is almost as good as determined.

This is basically Risk plus Cosmic Encounter minus the intolerable parts of either game. 

I don't love it, but it scratches the "take over the world" itch and the "have wacky powers" itch with a mechanical base that is vastly more solid than either of the aforementioned games. 

I find the calculative nature of the game to be a little dull and grating but I enjoy playing it once in a while. 

I enjoy the zany theme.

Hidden but trackable VP is stupid in any game.

Base game needs more races/powers.

I prefer to play with Tales and Legends to break up some of the calculation aspects.

One thing that really pisses me off is the stupid tie breaking rules that depend on physical player traits. It's pointlessly goofy and assumes you're a well adjusted adult who plays with a variety of other well adjusted adults instead of the only five people who can actually put up with you. Just play rock paper scissors or something. Jeez. :p

So far I've played only with two, and it works very well even with that number. Some imbalances of course turn up, and I'm not sure I like the ending conditions (easy to forget to slide the crown each round), but the massive replayability, charm, and delicious combinatorial mechanics make Smallworld a BIG winner in my book. Congratulations to all involved.

It was the hotness for a while but seems to have suffered a backlash from people expecting more than it ever offered.

A reasonably quick abstract territorial advantage game where you get to basically give up on your civilisation at least once and strike out with a new one.

There's a lot of potential combinations, some with great power, but this tends to be offset by the group pounding you'll get.

I'm quite keen on this, especially given the fact it scales for a wide range of numbers of players - with different boards for each.

The rules are simple, and the game play is fast and dynamic. There are race and special ability combos that you purchase with victory points - you run these rampant across the map. The moment that you anticipate that your troops will be less useful, you put the civilization in decline and pick up a new race-ability pair. You can only have one race in decline at once, except if you have the OP ability called Spirit that lets you have 2. The production value is high on this Days of Wonder game with icons on race and ability tokens that tell you what they do, an extremely well down player aid, and different maps depending on number of players. Fantastic with 5 players that clocks in around the 1-1.5 hour mark. 

In one of our 5 player games, two people ended up being fairly shut out due to the poor combos that were available to them. In addition, the Cursed ability caused a bottleneck as the top combo after everyone had selected their initial one, so players were very reluctant to go into decline. 

UPDATE: Some of the races and abilities are stronger than others. The Sorcerers and Trolls are strong races. Fortified and Spirit are strong abilities. The expansions add variety and interest. 

Tracked on family list (grooven)!

RATING: 9
The only territory-conquering game I really enjoy.
Has a magnificently tongue-in-cheek character and flavor, and the high-fantasy aspects are also good fun.  Has the potential for individual races to get unbalanced (were-gypsies are nigh unstoppable), so the balance comes from the multiplayer aspect (i.e. gang beatings).  That introduces a level of politics into the game.

I think this is an improvement on Vinci.  I like the hidden points (I think) and I like the themed races and powers.  However, like vinci, this is a very tactical game with long downtime.

The times that I play this game with the right group, almost nothing can beat it.  It is a blast.  Once, I played it with a group that was literally playing Risk when I approached, and it was magical.  They did not have experience outside of mass-market games, and they really really took to this one.  

However, if you play with a group that refuses to get into the theme or makes too big of a deal about how many pieces are in the game, or if you play with a group that pays no attention to which civilization they are choosing or when to go into decline, it can be a drag. They will complain the whole time, and in the end they will wonder why they wasted their time.  

You get out of this game what you're willing to put into it.

I was really excited to get this game but never really got into it after buying it. If I had people in my gaming circle that enjoyed this game and wanted to play it then I would probably rate it higher.

RATING: N/A
In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all. Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Was very disappointed by Small World. I expected to really like the mechanic of matching up racial abilities with special abilities at random in a queue, and I did! Problem is, the *rest* of the game felt fairly hollow to me. It seemed like all the tension and most important decision making went into analyzing the upcoming race choices and whether or not to go into decline (which itself is a rather boring mechanic). Once you pick a race, the choices on the map were unsatisfying to me. All build up and little payoff.

Plus, it took forever. I'm not sure if that's standard, but other Small World players I know have attested to taking a fair amount longer than the box says. Offers some fun in tinkering with a bunch of different race and ability combos, but longer than it's worth and not enough depth on the board to be more than decent for me.

My rate is something around 6, but may be counting up.

I have honestly tried to have fun with it. It's reached the table twice and both times the game experience was dull. I fells just like it lacks some sort of tension or opponent reaction mechanic, specially considering it is a game with a wacky war theme.
The over detailed and colour saturated board makes the task of clearly visualizing the troops redeployment a slight pain. I wish they had toned down the board colours in order to help the game play.
It's a really well-produced game though,but it didn't hit on me.

* Amended review.
After a few more plays, it started to grow on me. Once you see the game with the right eyes it turns out being quite fun. Actually really fun!
Since I've got it on ipad (which is rather well implemented) it has become my most played game. 
I still have problems with the messy board though, but I presume that the fact it becomes messy when crowded must be intentional.

Final verdict: the high rank is truly deserved. The game has a very unique mechanic and even though it lacks a bit of tension it is still very pleasant to play.

2-5(4)

I'm not really a fan of this two-player. There are some balance / first-player issues that get to me, and it's very much zero-sum so that catchup mechanisms don't apply (namely, leader-bashing).

Four-player, though, this is much more playable. There is some diplomacy and negotiation, which can stretch the game out, and perhaps may aggravate some players, but I don't necessarily mind. Imbalanced combos are mitigated, and there is a mechanism to check runaway leaders (even if the dreaded "bash the leader"). Downsides are that there are a lot of things to explain to a new player, reducing its suitability as a gateway game, and that there can be a bit of downtime between turns, especially if you have some AP players who are trying to math out the best ways to deploy. Felt a touch long, but it was a first play for two of us.

Not a favorite, but one that I'd certainly consider multi-player, and enjoyed much more than two-player. As a good conflict-/Risk-style game, this is worth a place in my collection.

Very easy to learn, and a varied and thematic set of races and abilities.  Also provides multiple boards for easy scaling to number of players. 

I'm not sure there's really much here in the way of gameplay, either tactically or strategically: while moving your armies, there seems to be either a blindingly obvious best move, or several identical moves; the only decision you actually make in this game is which opponent to mess with.

This means three things.  First, since there are no real decisions to make, combat is dull.  Second, there is a big gang-up-on-whoever-is-winning factor, since there's no real way to deter attacks against your opponents aside from creating a wall of guys at your frontiers, Risk-style (and, again Risk-style, an opponent can break through and gobble up your delicious unprotected interior).  Third, since there is also a significant difference in the power levels of the various races and race qualities, there's a big luck factor involved, with the player who happens to be ready to decline when Ghouls or Sorcerers are in the mix in much better shape than the guy who is seeing Dwarves and Wizards (who are boring as well as awful!)

I will give this game high marks for style, but style can't completely make up for dull gameplay.

It's an 8.5 for me today.  Got three plays in with two players and the first two were tight games.  Third game I drew Spirit Mermen, Ghouls, and then Elves.  Vince was so far behind that around the seventh round it got to be a bit of a grind. I could easily see it climbing up higher in ranking with three or four players.

Nice family/casual area control game. The components are of high quality and the colourful artwork is great. The rules are simple enough although each race has a unique racial ability and is given a random unique power. A lot of interaction between the players, low amount of luck.

i realy wanted to like this game.. but i hate the downtime between turns.. it realy spoils it for me.  some games have a bearable downtime as they are quite heavy and that's part of the deal.. but this is too light for the down time it has.

While Vinci somehow failed to make his way to my table (he wasn't very appealing to be honest), his facelift was a tsunami. Gets played a lot, I can even play it with my kids and have fun with it (somehow they don't attack daddy often though)

Play count is high tks to my ipad.

Used to be in my top 10, but he had to leave his seat for Tzolk'in.

Played it with 2 and 3 players. 2 players variant is playable but aggresive player with run over other one. 3 player variant feels more enjoyable. Still want to play it with 4 and 5. Great replayability with all the race + powers combinations. Would put it category light-medium difficulty conflict game with Risk-like elements. Medium difficulty because you need time to get feel which combinations are better then others.

This game's charm lies in its artistic direction and simplicity of rules.  A great way to introduce people to area control and has a fair helping of planning ahead.  A permanent place is reserved on my shelf for this classic, despite the fact that its starting to show its age.

RATING: 7.2
The mechanic of randomly pairing a race with a special ability gives this game infinite replayability.  The key is putting your current race into decline at the proper time.

It would be rated higher, but does get a little repetitious in placing your colonists or attacking with your armies, as the case may be.  Area control with a low learning curve.

Finally got to play this. It falls in a bit of a no-man's land in my collection. Too mean to play with kids, but Too light to make it to the top of my list when I have opponents willing to play a meatier game. 

I am glad I finally did, as it had some very entertaining moments and the race and special power combinations are great. Rating could go up (to an 8?) with a few more plays. It suited the taste of my thematic/interactive/fantasy game group, so will get to play again soon!

This strikes me as a very weak tea war game.  Very boring, unless you feel the thrill of playing pieces...for a turn or two...which have special powers.  Then you lose your army.  I don't like the board aesthetics either.

Some strategy involved and the strategy changes each play since the races and their bonus's change.  Play is pretty quick for a strategy game.  Conflict between players is inevitable in this and it is hard sometimes to tell who exactly is winning and needs to be taken out.

While simplistic, the actual gameplay is enjoyable.  The biggest drawback for me is constantly having to consult reference sheets to determine the different combos (which I guess is half the point).  Don't jump to play this, but I always have a good time when I do.

Fun little themed game with a nice helping of strategy.  Beautiful components and I love the artwork.  I like to think of this as a better, faster-playing Risk in a fantasy theme.  There is a fair amount of luck involved with what Race/Special Power combinations come up and who has first access to them, but there are usually several viable options without one being grossly overpowered.

This is a fun and relatively simple territory acquisition game with lots of race-ability combinations to keep it interesting during replays.

For now, I've enjoyed all of my plays, but the game didn't offer anything unexpectedly spectacular.

RATING: 6
I know many people love this series of games, but I'm not a big fan.  I love the race-creation mechanic (where you combine an adjective with the race to give it a unique blend of powers and rules), but, as someone that enjoys games like Axis and Allies, Fortress America, Twilight Imperium, etc. the combat is just too simplistic and "Euro-ish" for me.  The art is great and My kids love it, so it scores higher than the 5/10 I'd probably give it otherwise.

RATING: 9
I really enjoyed my only play of Vinci, and this new version was just as good.

Not only are the core mechanics fun, but they're also fairly unique.  There are two things to like here.  

The first is the nice assortment of races and special abilities and how they randomly combine to create a wide variety of options.  Some are better than others, but the auction system keeps it fair.

The other is the decision of when to put your current civilization in decline and start again with a new one.  Not only is this timing on this a tricky call to make, it has the added bonus of letting to switch over to a completely different civilization and approach the board in an entirely new way.

The rules are also surprisingly simple and it make this game a comparably easy game to learn.

We did make the mistake of playing with 5 players though.  It's still a fun game, but this lead to too much downtime.

Watching. Liked Vinci and this looks similar but with DOW's flair added. Can't go wrong with Days of Wonder.

Played and it is very much like Vinci. Not really Vinci light but Vinci with some tweeks to make it flow better.

It is a "beautiful" game to look at (DoW of course) but I think that the board is a little too busy and colourful.

I kind of wish that it had stuck to an ancient armies sort of theme as one thing I enjoyed in Vinci was seeing the rise and fall of empires across Europe. Far more epic than a cutesy fantasy world with bad taglines.

This game is all about the journey for me and just having fun destroying other people with crazy fantasy race and ability combos. Seeing the different combos that come out each game and positioning yourself to get a good one is a large part of the fun.

Often times, it's the player who played it safe and made the fewest enemies who ends up winning, but that doesn't matter too much for me. The game sometimes drags on a little too long, especially for a game that should be more about fun than winning.

Territory control game with cool elements. You control a race until you feel it is no longer effective, and then put it into decline. After which you begin a new race and continue trying to expand your empire. A light war game without player elimination. I've enjoyed each game I've played.

All told, I think I like Vinci better.  I was very scared of the graphically busy design, but up close and personal with it at the table things seemed fine.  Really like the maps based on player counts.  Not a fan of the dice.  I think the round limit works, but perhaps should have a couple more.  Hiding VPs - at least in our competitive 3P game - led to a lot of confusion on who the actual leader was, and I think mistakenly bashing the wrong leader is worse than bashing the exposed leader despite the metagaming and addition of AP.  My play was slightly soured by the presence of flying skeletons, effectively eliminating the map movement feel and positional safety.

For some reason, when I'm not playing this game, I do not think about it much, and I've never really been tempted to buy it, though that may only be because I know so many gamers who have it already.  Still, I have a good time while I'm playing Small World, and I'm never sorry to have spent my time at it.  I like that there don't seem to just be "good combos," rather the strength of combos can be very dependent on the situation of the game.

This is an awesome game. 

There's a strategic component, where you need to think about what races to pick and when to go into decline. This is pretty good and fun, but there are a few flaws. I think that as you learn the game better, you'll have a better idea what race you should pick in every common situation, and the game will become less re-playable as a result. However, there are a lot of good combos and idea to explore here, so I like it. 

Then there is the tactical elements--where to conquer on the board, where to reinforce your troops, how much territory to conquer, which territory to conquer. When you are making your strategic decisions, you must also take into consideration these things. 

The dice rolls for battles are an element of luck. While it is fairly small in this game, I'm not big into rice rolling to decide battles.

RATING: 8
As a fan of Vinci, there wasn't a big draw to pick this one up.  But after much prodding, it finally hit the table.  And it was worthwhile.  Excellent production quality and the game's design is truly streamlined.  This plays out as a refined Vinci.  Not sure the die is all that much of an improvement, but the rest of the game really shines; especially game length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite aspect of this game is that no two plays are ever the same.  Especially with the two main expansion packs (Dames and Cursed!) there are enough race and power combos to keep it fresh.  Even if you see repeat combos, they do not play the same depending on the other races in play on the board.  We recently started playing with Tales & Legends as well, which adds an entirely new aspect of strategy to the game.  Some of the T&L cards force you to shift your strategy in a way that you would not have done otherwise.  I am a huge fan and cannot seem to get enough of this game.  I have the game for the iPad too and I wish it kept a tally of number of games played because my numbers would be through the roof.  The speed of the game in comparison to real life is a big plus.  One criticism of the iPad version, though, is with the limit of a 2 player game... and the speed... when you play as often as I do it tends to get a bit more redundant.

Very fun game with a simple mechanic.  Each game is completely different each time because of the combinations of races and powers.  A few of my friends have found it a little too complicated because I included too many expansions and 'who does what' can be a bit cumbersome once you get away from the base game cheat sheet.

Simply put a tremendously fun game with a unique visual style to it, loads of variation and that's just with the base set alone. The kind of title I'll be happy to share with my family, in particular my son when he's older. It's fairly light, but I enjoy that the different races have their own mechanics and the diversity that the power cards bring.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable.  Vinci in a fantasy setting, with seperate maps for number of players so it scales well.  This edition has better components, but it hard to tell the races apart when they are in decline.  If you're trying to decide between this and Vinci, the question is whether you want a historical or fantasy based game.  Not enough of an difference/improvement over Vinci that I feel like I need to run out and get it.

hurm.

the gameplay changes between this and Vinci are generally good.

almost every change is towards a cleaner, quicker, smoother game.

then... the graphic design clutters up the board, and the game slows down and becomes -harder- than vinci when you try to track who is who, and what the various races are scoring.

needs another play or three to see, but the inelegance of the board is starkly contrasted to the elegant rules...

--

and after the above, I heartily recommend you get another game, pull player colors out and use them to mark your territories.  It fixes all of my issues with the above and takes the game from taxing to fun.  Silly how a simple thing can make such a big change.

Two games where everyone was new (apart from me in the second of course) and I'd probably need to play more to work out which race/ability combos work well. But, it doesn't seem that interesting, and is very susceptible to slow players making things unpleasant.

I really like how this game is evolving upon more play.  Not much is as it seemed with the first couple plays.  Smallworld is turning out to be much more of an abstract wargame than a eurogame, in ways that I happen to like.  There is more of both strategy and tactics than I thought at first, and the 'luck' of the race stack is no worse than 'weather' in a hardcore wargame, and is fact a very good wargaming sort of aspect of the same vein.

Given that, this game apparently has no wargame stigma to the people that typically steer clear of wargames, making the player pool available much broader.

We play with visible points though.  I very much dislike quasi-hidden information.  If you've seen it once (the VPs) you may as well let them stay visible, unless the point of the game is memory, like for example, the game Memory.

I think I also prefer playing to a score rather than a number of turns.  This is because on a hard turn count the last run or two become purely tactical, where as with at least a little turn-end uncertainty and recourse, strategic play penetrates closer to the end.  And either way (to turns or to points) I prefer going longer than the default rules say, by about 50%.

So maybe I'd personally like Vinci even better.  I don't know.  But I have this one, and the players I play with like this one, so this is the one I'll play.

I really love this game, but I ding it two stars for:
1. Being time consuming to set up, clean up and transport, especially with an expansion or two.
2. Having a lot of downtime during other player's turns, particularly with more players.

It is, however, very fun, imaginative and strategically complex. It's easy to teach and play, but can also be very competitive and deep. I credit this game for helping me get my wife interested in board gaming.

One of the most beautiful games I've played, with a fun mechanic - constantly invading the 'small world'.  

Although fun, have found that not all the 'races' are quite balanced, especially the expansion ones, and the game isn't quite as deep as I thought it would be - whenever I play, I kind of play by numbers.

RATING: 4
I started off considering this a great, fun, light-weight game, but outgrew it very swiftly. Rather amazed to realize how my initial rating of "8" dropped this low, but the game just isn't all that good. My main complaint about it is that it suffers badly from "bash the leader", and doesn't have a whole lot of staying power. The initial promise of near-infinite replayability turns out to be hollow, as most of the powers and races are too similar in execution for the variety of combos to really offer anything new after a few games. As I realized this, I simply grew less and less interested in playing it.

I traded this away for Antike in the Essen 2014 math trade.

The game is not bad, but some things about it are disturbing for me. Downtime is quite long, and there is actually a little of planning. Every move I just try to earn most money with some obvious tactic area control decisions. The only thing I like is choosing the factions with paying or not, but this is made only twice per game (not counting the first choice from only two factions).

It's a nice delightful little war game, which has a good fit with the theme and takes the right amount of time. The two player game seems as good as the multi-player game in my experience.

RATING: 7
It is a bit like Cosmic Encounter is that you don't as much care if you win at completion, but look more to whether you played your combination(s) as well as you could or perhaps even role played a theme.  I might rather pick an odd combination to try versus an obvious point collector.

A big step up from Cosmic Encounter is that you can essentially skip a turn at any time and reincarnate as a brand new army.

RATING: 7.5
Oleadas de razas estrambóticas invaden con fuerza un territorio muy pequeño, empujándose y luchando unas con otras, hasta perder empuje y desaparecer... Cada jugador toma el poder de dos o tres razas durante la partida y su objetivo es conseguir la mayor cantidad de puntos expandiéndose y cambiando de raza en el momento óptimo que será justo cuando la primera raza pierda fuerza y entre en declive.

Tiene reglas muy sencillas que se explican facilmente y cuenta con unos componentes estupendos, de carton duro, con bonitas ilustraciones. Tiene más ventajas, turnos cortos, que hacen que no exista apenas espera y que se siga la partida con interés ya que los movimientos de los demás interesan y mucho a tu propia estrategia y mucha interacción directa, que crea piques sanos y entendibles. Este es su punto fuerte: al estar todo orientado al buen rollo, al mundo muy pequeño, a las razas curiosas y graciosas, los piques son entendidos como cosas que tienen que pasar.

Por eso Smalworld es un buen juego y además divertido. Para mí recomendable. Mucho.

The whole 'game' is to judge when to send your race in decline once a good combination becomes availabe.

Some lovely game mechanics here, especially the random combination of races and their special abilities, giving numerous variations. The way these are bought is also neat, with unwanted ones gaining attraction as time goes by as coins are added to them. 
I thought I'd hate the (almost) diceless combat but it works and helps the game rattle along nicely. The overall narrative of the waxing and waning of races is neat.
One complaint: I thought the artwork on the board, especially the smaller board for three players, rather poor.

Very good light war game with few rules.
I have some problems about:
1) A lot of races that force you to read rules too much times

RATING: 6
I'm not quite sure what Small World is yet, but I think it might be the new Nexus Ops.

What I mean is this:  Whenever I meet someone who wants to try a new game but is mostly familiar with Risk, I tend to recommend Nexus Ops.

Nexus Ops is a fantastic game, but Small World might be able to accomplish the same task in half the time.  It's not as meaty as Nexus Ops but I suppose that's the trade off for the streamlined experience you get.

The great strengths of Small World:  Simplicity (the basic rules and flow of play is laughably easy:  pick up dudes.  put them down on the map.  get points).  Speed (I've played with 4 and 5.  Both games seemed to fly by even with new players).  Variety.  It's great fun to see how the different mixture of races and abilities affect the game board.

Creeping Doubts:  The game feels a bit "static" to me.  I'm not sure why.  It doesn't LOOK static.  Decisions:  I'm not sure that the decision-making is as rich as I'd like it to be.

My first game was fun.  My second game was better.  I sense great potential.


****UPDATE***
I should smack myself for the "the new Nexus Ops" comment.  Small World cant hold a candle to Nexus Ops.  BUT it is a great game for people who are new to the hobby.  I've introduced it to a couple different groups and it's almost always loved.  I keep it in my collection for that reason only.

Its not awful, there's just other games I like better.

A great game that takes some of the ideas from Vinci and History of the World but put them with mechanics that are just as easy as Ticket to Ride to learn. The variety and number of the races and power combos make every game a little different. There is a little bit of the "early leader" effect, but most of the time this isn't problem. My only criticism is that some races and powers are overpowered (Elves, pillaging) compared to some that are weak (Dwarves, spirit).Overall, a lot of fun that even non-gamers will enjoy!

Másodjára kicsit javult a megítélésem, de most sem aléltam el tőle. Szerintem 1 % stratégia (mikor küldjem nyugdíjba a népemet), és 99% taktika, legalábbis 5-en játszva. Előre gondolkodni szinte felesleges, adott pillanatban kell jó népet választani, minél többet ütni, aztán mire újra rám kerül a sor, majd meglátjuk mi lesz. A hangulata viszont nem rossz.

Introduced at the Victorian Catan comp. (after we were all elimintated). 
It didn't do anything for me. It felt like a short and spasmodic Risk game. But then I really enjoyed Clans. Weird I suppose! 
The lesson is that sometimes I can't predict what I'll like. Maybe it depends on the group, the timing, the mood, etc???

update: Played again in 2013 - still not convinced that it's something I'll ever *want* to play.

update: played with Juzz. Maybe I don't like coz it's shorter than Risk but not enough shorter? Would be a great 20-30 minute game.

Small World is one of my top favorite games of all time. I normally pick up games that have a good amount of variety so it never gets boring or really repetitive. Small World though does something a little different then other games that try to make it randomized in different ways. Throughout the game you will be grabbing fantasy races that have some crazy power to them. The powers are what makes the randomness of the game great. Every time you play you will have different powers attached to some kind of army of creature to push your opponents around. The part that gets me the most is the game is not determined by who killed the most enemies,or who was able to make a large clutter of tokens across the board. The game scores you on how well you used each of your tokens per round. Sometimes keeping to yourself or being peaceful will get you more points then pillaging fish people with orcs. Some people are not big fans of Small World because there are a lot of different things to know. Best advice is to just look at what powers come up and don't worry about the rest. Small world is a fantastic game if you want one with a lot of re-playability.

Cool themes, but merely average gameplay.  I don't care for the random nature of the game.  The only interaction with other players is just attacking them.  There is no depth to the attack because it simply comes down to having enough units or rolling a die to obtain them.  In my wargames, I would prefer more bluffing, bartering, and backstabbing.

Small World is THE gateway multiplayer wargame.

Theme is ridiculously funny, games are fast, variable racial powers are compelling, there are some decisions (which race+power you choose, when going into decline, spreading thin or clustering)... There is definitely much to love inside the box!

And, almost forgot: there is (almost) no dice rolling, and no being cornered à la Risk (watching friends having fun for 2 hours, without a slim chance to win): the perfect combo for a recovering Risk addict (I played it too much in my early teens)!

I love this games completely deterministic combat because it becomes far less about winning/losing fights and much more about knowing how to exploit the game's main mechanics: going into decline, and the silly amount of race/power combinations.  Especially when you throw in some of the mini expansions or the large box expansion, you get a lot of replayability.  The fact that the game comes standard with maps for each player count makes it an absolutely amazing game for all its player counts.  It is simple enough to be a great gateway game, but still interesting enough to be a good game to play with more experienced gamers.  It just works really well.

rating after one 3p game. very pleased with this: i was just thinking about designing a game with this kind of gameplay, and small world does it quite well.
"Use Larry Levy's Variant for 4 or 5 players: Choose races in reverse order starting with last player. (Player 5 can choose his beginning civ, using the normal rules, or he can pass. If he passes, Player 4 now has the option. This continues until one player chooses a civ, in which case Player 5 again has the option to choose or pass, or until Player 1 is reached, in which case he must choose a civ.)"

Wow! What a good game! With the "Cult of the New" being so prevalent nowadays it is all too easy to neglect solid game such as this.
This game's mechanics are so tight, the variety you get with classes and races makes for so much fun and a ton of replay-ability. 
Glad this soon to be classic game finally made it's way back to the table! I have a feeling it will start to finally see some of the action it deserves.

Origineel spel, waarin je met rassen op veroveringstocht gaat.  Rassen uit de Tolkien wereld, die gecombineerd worden met speciale eigenschappen.  Deze combinaties zijn elk spel anders, en dit maakt elk spel weer verschillend.

Een eerste keer spelen was voor mij een beetje rommelig; ik had niet door welk soort rassen de anderen hadden, en zat voordurend op mijn blad (handig wel) te kijken, zodat ik niet echt bij het spel was.

Tovenaars zijn zeer krachtig als je met 4 of 5 speelt.

A light fantasy-themed area control game with enough variety with the ever-changing race-skill combinations. It has a bit a learning curve until you get a feel for the potential that lies within a race and/or skill.

(*) We bid VP to determine the start-player because it makes the game fairer when one or more good races are available. The VP are to be paid after the game ends and one can bid as high as he wants.

I have to say I was expecting to enjoy this a lot more then I did, i only play games with 2 players (me and partner) maybe the game is more fun with more however it felt...I dunno kind of flat despite all the powers and races to choose it seemed a little pointless for some reason.

Another game that I can't get out of my head!  I had so much fun...didn't win--but figuring out how best to implement the races and bonuses I chose, and when to put them into decline, really drew me in.  And, WOW, what amazing opportunities for replayability!  This game the skeletons are flying, and next neither the race or bonus may show up.  If they do, it's more than likely they won't be matched again.  Super idea to have four different boards for four different numbers of opponents, and the artwork is great too.  Definitely will be on my next game order!

RATING: 9
[i]Posted: 1/18/10, Rated: 9[/i]

Let's talk about Batmen, shall we?  Or Flying Ratmen, if you prefer.  Somewhere between [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/]Tim Burton[/url] and [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/]Christopher Nolan[/url] lies the creatively twisted mind that brought us [i]Small World[/i].  Sure, it reimplements [i][thing=60]Vinci[/thing][/i].  I never played that game, but I seriously doubt that it had anything close to the level of whimsy as [i]Small World[/i].

The game play itself is quite simple: this is an engine management game, masquerading as a war game.  Yes, you have a bunch of cardboard chits.  Yes, you can attack each other with them.  However, the results are usually predictable: the number of chits needed to win a battle is easily determined.  Only the last attack of each player's turn can utilize a custom die to see how many "reinforcements" are available.  This structure rewards solid play, while still allowing for the occasional oddball result.  I really like that mix, as opposed to the alternative of randomly determining the result of every conflict.

The results are predictable unless your race has the "Berserk" attribute, in which case you roll the reinforcements die on every attack.  Here is where the game gets [i]ka-razy.[/i]  There are a plethora of special powers, which augment a race that has its own ability.  The two tiles fit together in a tongue-and-groove fashion to create a "some type of something" relationship.  There are some obvious synergies: Berserk Orcs.  Seafaring Tritons.  Hill Giants.  And then there are the screwball combos like the Diplomatic Ghouls: "Sorry about eating your mum's brains, old chap.  Let's let bygones be bygones, shall we?"  With fourteen races, and twenty special powers, the possibilities are endless.

Well, okay, not endless.  There are 280 of them.  The immense variability and unpredictability make you want to sit down with both stacks of tiles, and explore every combination.  It would take a literal day (24 hours), if you spent five minutes on each combo, and allowed yourself an additional 40 minutes for food and bio breaks.  Theoretically, of course.  No one would really do that.  Ahem.

As if that weren't enough, you'll see 15-20 such combinations during the course of a game, playing 4-5 of them yourself.  The number of different games you could play as a result would be...a lot.  Games with unpredictable swings, wild power couplings, all done with humor and style.  The quality of the artwork, and the selection of powers and races lend a narrative quality to the game.  It's as if there's a story lurking beneath the board, waiting to be told.  I love that feeling of transportation when playing a game, and it's worth a full point upgrade in my rating.

Just watch out for those Flying Ratmen.  Ratmen have no special abilities of their own (eerie, isn't it?  I mean Bruce Wayne isn't a "super" through genetics), but there are a [i]ton[/i] of them.  And when they're Flying, they could show up anywhere.  They're Batmen.

RATING: 9
One of my first 'heavier' games when I started the hobby, heavier in the sense of remembering all the races and their traits and interaction with one another. Otherwise, very easy to learn. Reminded me a lot of Risk (one of my childhood fav games) with much lesser luck and play much quicker. Area control game with high player interaction. There's just something fun about attacking your friends and they still have a chance to fight back by declining and choosing a new race for revenge.

28/8: This game is so highly rated probably due to my sense of nostalgia to it. I dropped the rating from 10 to 9.5 as this game depends a lot on the people you play with enjoying the process as well. Best to play with people that play it like Game of Thrones, negotiating who to attack who and forming 'temporary' alliances. 

18/9: Dropping it further to a 9 cause people you play with strongly influences your rating of a game. Very group-dependent game. However, this game will always have a special place in my heart.

I don't know, I'm not big on this Days of Wonder offering. It's not bad, and it does scale well, but I find the deterministic combat dull, and the theme is weirdly dark? Like it's about settling areas by wiping away the natives and other races? I'm usually not touchy about themes but this feels kind of morbid for the colorful exterior. Yeah the game has a lot of variability, but I don't find the game to have a satisfying arc, and the scoring is a little hard to explain.

A light Euro style dudes on a map game from Days of Wonder. Components are stellar as usual with DOW. The rules are fairly easy to learn but give some challenge on how to plan out your strategy. Which race/ability combo to take is it's own little mini-game. When to go into decline and start over is probably the most important decision you will make the whole game. This is solid stuff and I would recommend it to anyone just starting up a collection. For Trade note: I would only trade the complete Small World package, not just the base game and not just loose expansions. If no takers in a few months, I will end up listing the lot on an Auction Geeklist.

Pretty straight forward game play, but extremely fun.  I like the fact that even when your territories are being eaten up by someone you can always come back with a new race on a future turn.

Take a simplistic base ruleset and sprinkle on access to heaps of special abilities for variety.

Rated a 7 based on it being a good game with a crapload of downtime.

One solid problem I have with this game is that you know when you're going to decline the next turn.  So you have to sit through x number of people to call out "decline" and do some book-keeping...  Then you can sort of decide on what race you're going to grab next and what you're going to do with them.  So there's these x player minute bursts of not doing anything.  

The downtime while waiting for people to shuffle their fiddly bits, sucks.

...and you decline at least in turn 3, and probably around turn 7-8.

1-6-2014 - ipad musings after a zillion plays

A solid 9 and one of the better games out there.  Absolutely great with the computer handling the boring work and the turns taking no time.

It's interesting to note that there's still some pretty good downtime waiting for the computer players to finish is crazy on the 4-5 player maps, and they're super fast.  Worse, is that it seems like there isn't a lot you can do to really pretend like you know what you're doing against the other players on a 4-5 player board.  2-3 players is really neat.  2 players is a fantastic fruity little chess match, and 3 players also holds many of the same redeeming qualities.  Downtime isn't nearly as bad.

I find myself gravitating towards the same races or qualities, but there's been some humorous combinations I've seen.  Diplomat skeletons, played right, can almost swallow a whole 3 player board and force the opposition to kill eachother.  I still chuckle about it.

With the expansions, this game has a high degree of replay factor.  The game forces conflict but I have found that because it is such an inherent element of the game, that even more casual gamers are ok with the conflict. As with any game that has conflict, there can be a sense that everyone else's fighting strategy isn't what you think it should be.

A pretty unique game and definitely worth owning.

Though the rules are easy to grask and few in number, there are many interesting choice to be made during the game.  I would call the game elegant, though not quite as elegant as games such as Samurai.  I actually get boared with a game that is perfectly elegant.  The replay value is fantastic, and the competition is high.  I highly recommend this game.

[EDIT] after more than 10 games, the verdict remains the same: as boring as hell, i really can't understand why this game have so many positive reviews! It lacks in game variety, poor and old game mechanics. Diceless doesn't means always original and fun! :(

на двоих игра не понравилась надо попробовать на 3их и больше. На 2их не понравилось из-за того что кто выбрал более имбовую(нарушающую правила) расу+умение тот и выиграл. При игре на 2их не возможно поправить ситуацию. Высокая вероятность кинг-мейкинга тоже очень бесит!!! + c дополнением Small World: Tales and Legends игра становится разнообразнее и интереснее + в 3йом играть лучше чем в 2йом. Продал изза кингмейкерства

Easy to explain, colourful, and just piles of fun. I love the power/race combos (try to find someone who isn't amused by the idea of flying ratmen or commando halflings), and part of the thrill comes from figuring out which ones in a given game are going to be powerhouses and which are total "non-bos". But it's far from soulless number crunching and points-optimisation. How, where and who to attack are a massive part of the game, as well as managing the rise and decline of each of your teeny civilisations. Fantastic stuff.

Game feels a lot less abstract and a lot friendlier than it's former incarnation Vinci. Amazing how much a game can improve with a good retheme. You would even be able to play this with non gamers. Also the rulechanges that were made are all improvements. Esspecially the different maps for different numbers of players and the hidden scoring. There also seems to be more balance in the abilities of the different races. Rules as printed are awfull and a disgrace for Days of Wonder.

I like this as a two player lunch time strategy game.  It's no where near as strategic as chess, but is short enough to fit within the 60 minute limit.  The mixture of race and powers does provide for some very hilarious emergent stories as the sturdy ghouls recede providing support to the flying elves as they rise to glory.

This game really surprised me.  The rules don't make you think it will be very strategically interesting.  However, the mix of special powers and racial abilities really makes for some neat decisions.  Knowing which combos will be the most valuable, and how to best take advantage of those abilities is crucial to succeeding.  I'm also surprised how important it is to know when you should enter decline.

Although I wouldn't necessarily define this as a family game, it is quite simple to understand the basic mechanism of conquering territories.  I also really enjoy the flow of the game.  After that initial decision of what race you want to take, the turns can really fly by.  Also, because you have to go in decline on one turn but don't grab a new race until the next turn, players usually have plenty of time to make up their minds on which race they will take.  This eliminates a massive opportunity for analysis-paralysis, which I greatly appreciate.  I'm not sure if I love this game yet, but I certainly like it and want to play some more.

Most recent play: it's an OK game, but really it's just a vehicle for being social and talking.

A bit simplistic and I find it rather fiddly.  Lots of stuff you need to grab / update / move around.  Maybe it's just because I'm always the one doing that stuff since I own the game.

Got a good 10 or 15 plays out of it, got sick of it, but now I'm tempted to try it again since I found a good storage solution.

VARIANT: maybe try 2 coins to skip like in Vinci.

A really well-made game.  I love that the included storage is logically designed.  I would love to see how this game plays with 4 or 5.

Another enjoyable game with great production values, but repetitive gameplay. The fixed board and randomly combined races/attributes weren't enough to give me a driving desire to play the game again and again. The "going into decline" concept works wonders in terms of forcing players to make tough decisions each turn. I find it enjoyable to break out periodically.

Mix Risk with a fantasy theme and then shorten the game time down to about an hour and you have Small World. I wasn't very into this game at first, but it started to grow on me as I understood the rules a little better.

This game played a lot easier than I expected and it was definitely a lot of fun.  My first three games were with 5 players and I'm interested to see how it works with different numbers of players.  Hopefully, I'll get a chance to play this a few more times.

I now own this game and played it with 5 players again. I realized that while the idea of the game is fun (combining powers and races), this isn't really my style of game with more direct conflict than I desire.  Of course, if all players are truly playing for their best interests then it works.  If the game moves quickly then I'm in for a round of it, but this is the type of game that just dies when it slows down.  My recent play was too slow and now I'm not looking forward to trying again.  Since everyone can simply mess with your stuff on the board, there is only so much you can do to minimize the negatives and it's important to take your turn and move on... like most games.

My wife and have played this a few times, and once or twice 3 player.  I want to like it -- I like the streamlined fighting, and the artwork and components are fantastic.

BUT, I just don't think I like the cycling through races mechanic.  Mainly because it feels like it dominates the game -- what race/power combo can I get? Is it good for going into decline with? Should I go into decline yet? If I wait any longer I wont have to do it again before the game end? Blarg!

RATING: 6
I thought this game was great when I first started gaming.  And it is good...depending on where you are in gaming these days.  I now play mostly medium to heavy euros so the simplistic nature of Small World is quaint and largely unengaging.

Pros:
Great attempt at scaling (although the game is still better at higher player counts)
Solid Days of Wonder production
Whimsical, colorful, and humorous
Excellent for families

Cons:
Simplistic design with little depth - mostly a min/max exercise
Few important choices
Lower player counts lack the interaction and invariable negotiation (“No, invade THEM!”) that elevates the experience
Insert is useless if the box is stored on its side

I’m not getting rid of the game but it is mostly for kids and non-gamers now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Used to be my favorite game. But I think there's a limited life with this game; after a while, you just want to move on. The expansions add a little life, but it doesn't really give you extra decisions to make. A fairly superficial game. That's not bad, but it leaves you wanting eventually.

Smallworld is a great, almost introductory, area control game. Imagine risk, except the battlefield scales well to the number of players and is balanced, the combat isn't random and is dead simple, there's no elimination, you get variable character powers, and you can decide at any point to be new characters. These things, coupled to a somewhat goofy fantasy theme and a playtime of 45-60 minutes, make this an absolute go-to for me.

I’m unsure what I like the best in Small World, for I deeply enjoy its light-hearted theme, its quick and entertaining gameplay and its simplicity, which makes Small World an obvious choice when casual gamers are around: and actually it never fails to make a hit with newcomers.
Expansions, at least those increasing both the races and the special abilities, are a precious and necessary addition to the game.

Edit: after further playing Small World and loving it more and more, I had to revise my rating, improving it from 8 to 9.

This is more of an area control style game than a conflict dudes on a map style game.  The beauty of the design is that you're never out of the game.  If your fantasy race has been pummeled to the verge of extiction, then you can put them into decline.  The following turn you can roar back onto the map with a head full of steam.  Really fantastic game with lots of variety.  Works great with any amount of players.  Get the expansions, they help increase the replay value so you're not seeing the same combos over and over again.

After one play, I think this one deserves its reputation. It has high production values, plays relatively quickly and scales really well. 

Central mechanic is interesting; you have to run a constant risk/reward analysis of your current active "race" (gamers - can we get over this 19th century idea already? They're clearly species, which is something entirely different and poses its own complexities) to see when it's worth going into decline; hold on too long and you're stuffed, go too quickly and you don't reap the full reward. You also need to keep tabs on what power/race combinations are available, which adds to the assessment.

If this hits the table I'll definitely play, but I can't see myself buying it.

Játék-játék-játék és jóóó. Nagyon jó kis stratégia, konfrontációval ami kell is bele, hisz egy területfoglalós játékról beszélünk. Élveztem minden percét - bár mikor engem pusztítottak szomorúan vettem tudomásul - mert hangulatos a játék. Nagyon egyszerű és könnyen tanulható. Csak is egyedül a fajok kivesézése tart sokáig, de a jelek alapján hamar rá lehet jönni egy idő után. Semmiképpen nem ajánlom olyan játékosnak, aki képtelen a játékon kívül helyezni a kapcsolatait és csak azért nem megtámadni, hogy ne haragudjon meg. Ha így tesz lerombolja mások játékát. Ha mindig mindenki a számára megfelelő döntést lépi személyeskedés nélkül egy igen jó játék kerekedik belőle. Itt nincsenek szövetségesek és tudomásul kel venni. Amint szövetségek jönnek létre a játék sava-borsa eltűnik és csak megutáltatjuk azokkal, akik épp most ismerkednének vele.

A war game for people with no tolerance for war games. The artwork gives the game a lighthearted feel, but the screw-you factor is huge!

In concept, Small World is a great game with a lot of variable play. The ever-changing factions, and deciding which ones to buy and when, are the high point of this game. Unfortunately, the gameplay of attacking and taking over territories tends to be a bit boring. This is because both players in a battle don't have to be involved. There is nothing a defending player can do to stop an attack. If the attacker has enough units, they win. The strategy is in setting up your defenses and knowing when to bail and bring in fresh troops. 

The game is fun, with a ton of variety. If the war mechanism was just a bit more interactive, I think I would play this all of the time.

The map changes depending on the number of players, plus the armies/races and powers match up differently every time you play.

Prev owned with all small expansions. The game itself is fine. Beautifully done as all Days of Wonder games. The idea of random match between races and abilities is fun. But the game is just too simple. After some plays it gets boring even with that amount of races and abilities. It doesn't require any strategy just placing tokens on pretty much obvious places and rolling a die on last one. There is a little strategic thinking involved in the right time to extinct and choose next race combo. It is a really good intro game or game to play with kids. In a right mood I might play it again but it does not have a spot in my collection anymore :(

I'm not sure if I like it.  Feels rushed compared to Vinci since the game ends after 9 rounds instead of when a point threshold is reached.  The time-limited nature of the game makes the timing of going into decline even more critical than in Vinci (especially for the final rounds).

RATING: 6
I admit that I'm in the minority on this one, even in my gaming group. I just don't think the game holds up after a couple of plays. The theme mostly comes from the charming artwork, not from the mechanics of the game. The different races and abilities give you a +1 here or a +1 there on the board. As your turn falls to you, the most interesting choice is what race to pick up, but then your choice of regions to conquer is more or less determined by the layout of the board optimized with your race's bonuses. Your success as the game continues has more to do with how the next player finds his optimal conquest path and so on. The theme slips away to simple arithmetic and reveals very few engaging choices. At the end a tally of gold determines the winner. It just seems to be a pretty shallow experience on all counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fast and quite fun. The only drawback is the set board, which will of course work to limit replayability. But it's the races and powers that give you replayability, so the overall effect should be good.

Easy to see why this is shaping up to be the best of 2009. If I had any issue with the game, it'd be that the maps are too busy from an art standpoint.

Still, game is solid. If you are looking for mechanics in the game, You won't find it here :) I really enjoy it as a backup family game.

I suggest to buy "LA ISLA" by Feld instead of this! Or "Stone Age" :)

First play with three of my sons was a blast!  The four-year old was able to easily keep track of what was going on, and with some guidance make some good moves.  The nine and eight year olds grasped the concept immediately and were right into it from the start.  Great, fun game, lots of strategy, yet so simple to learn.  I strongly recommend this for both family fun and gaming groups!

Simple rules, but this is another game with amazing depth despite the simple rules.  A minute to learn a lifetime to master?  Could be.

After multiple two-player games with an adult opponent, the game retains it's fun factor and strategy levels.  Still loving it!

More plays with adults have been played.  It's still a fun game, but it's beginning to fill the role as a filler game rather than the main event for the evening.  I still rate this game quite highly but since it's missing the epic feel that most of the main event games I play have it's not likely to be played as often as before.

The shine is certainly coming off this game for me.  I still play it with my sons, but it's not something I'll be pulling out to play with my gaming group any time soon.

RATING: 7
10 plays: 

I love playing this game, but it's a bit tough to get other people into it. The fantasy theme turns off some players, and it takes a few plays to feel like everything isn't arbitrary. Also, the endgame is weak because it's so often obvious who has won, and there's little anyone can do about that. But I've mostly played with 2 people. 

Also, the scoring in general make you slow down to count and collect point tokens. It's just clunky. 

That said, I adore the game design from top to bottom, and gameplay is simple and elegant, with plenty of room for strategy but not much analysis paralysis. And it's not at all fiddly, which I care a lot about. 

Seriously, though, the visual design, rules and component quality are a triumph. Just one of the most expertly designed games I've ever seen.

I thought this was a very interesting game when I was introduced to it several years ago.  After my first couple of plays though the guy who had it seldom wanted to bring it out.

Eventually I got a copy for my self and introduced it to some other fellas who I though might like it.  Two of them completely snapped over it.  They bought their own copies along with just about every available expansion.  When I wasn't around they would play it like mad.  So when I came to play they wanted to play something else, something they didn't have.

As such it took me quite awhile before I had played enough of this to discover that while it has some repeat play value, it's not actually as interesting to me as I thought it would be.

Still fun, but I can finally see why others stop playing it after a bit.

Great on the first few plays but got stale fast.  The strategy of choosing a race combination is usually straight-forward in terms of which available race will do the best for you.  The same can be said about where to attack, the best strategy seems to be easily seen and most people will go with what makes sense.

I tend to hate dice in a war game because they are too random.  However, this is partially a war game where things are not random enough.  It doesn't feel as fulfilling to drop your tokens down and just win by majority.

RATING: 8.5
VINCI redux with a lot more personality and with a somewhat simplified system, but new players may find the board quite busy and confusing. Some of the changes are interesting however and the games are shorter owing to the fixed turn track. This also means you will be turning over fewer "civilizations" so your initial choices will count for much more and your spot in the turn order may doom the game for you depending on the random combos that emerge in the early going. I'm enjoying it but, all-in-all, I'm not convinced that it represents a big improvement over VINCI.

Hidden vs open VPs is a "name your poison" thing so your view on this is going to be very subjective. In one (VINCI) you go after the leader you know as opposed to going after the one you think is leading (Small World). Whack the leader vs inadvertent King-making. As I said, name your poison...

Since our group loves this game, and I find myself playing it more often, it is certainly growing on me and I'm enjoying it well enough; but, I still don't understand how this game gets rated so much higher than VINCI which remains the better and more challenging game.

Great game of area control,  without too much take that in the process.  Unless a player is obviously in the lead you can pretty much stick to your own plan.  Each race and ability is different so killing other clans is not always the best way to spread your dominance in this small world.  There are enough clans and abilities in the game you do not need any expansions, but the more the merrier I always say.  Great family fun.

I like Vinci, so expected to like this. Gameplay changes are generally good (although some like the hidden vps we play as a variant for Vinci already and I'm not a fan of the die roll).

But I don't like it as much ... why?

Firstly theme - I just prefer the ancient civilization setting rather than the generic fantasy setting of Small World. Waves of Barbarians attacking the crumbling empires works, but I find the theme in small world less engaging.

Secondly (and more importantly) I loathe the graphics. Board is cluttered, it is hard to see region types, we had a big discussion at the start of the game on which type certain regions were - not good! And then once you're playing, it gets progressively harder to track who is who and what races are scoring.

Thirdly, stupid counter tray which makes put away a toe-curling nightmare of a chore, just dump the thing and use bags (and as I don't own it chances are when I play it the counter tray will appear at the end and we'll all have 15 minutes of frustration putting the game away).

So overall, I'd much rather play Vinci!

Theme is amazing. 
The combat part of the game is non-existent. I was disappointed with the lack of decisions to make in that respect.

There's seemingly endless variety with combinations of different powers and races and I think they're pretty cool.  The game plays quickly and smoothly and it's basically area control.  It's the type of thing I should like and I do to an extent.  But I've always been a little disappointed in this one and it's always felt kind of bland.  It doesn't seem like choices are very interesting except perhaps recognizing and getting good race/power combos.  Beyond that it comes down to timing when to put a race into decline.

It's Vinci, rethemed.  Not Vinci Lite, or any other description that makes it seem like it might be different.  Just Vinci.  But Vinci is pretty good.  And if you play with open VPs, Small World would be pretty good too.  This is a game of short term positioning and optimization.  A little too thinky and dry for my taste, but I'd play if offered.  I think my main problem is that the game is long, but offers very little in the way of strategy - it's all tactics.  But it has to be long because it's decided by small margins, so you have to play long enough for those margins to define a winner.

I really like this game. For me. all the changes from Vinci are improvements: Shorter playing time, better scaling, less AP due to hidden scoring.

I also like the setting, which allows for more table talk and snide remarks than the ancient background in Vinci.

Nevertheless, the artwork seem to be a little bit overdone, and the board becomes a little cluttered with several active and declined races (especially when flying or underground was involved and the units are scattered all over the board).

I prefer the cleaner implementation of Vinci.
Otherwise though, they're so similar I guess it's
about the same.

Special boards/length for different number of players
may be a plus. All the expansions? Maybe not so much -
it's just not something I want to play enough to explore
a full set of such.

This game is simple to play, great for new gamers and advanced gamers alike.   Even though the game is simple in concept it is very deep in strategy.  I love the fact that the main game tiles are interchangeable.  I like this because you are likely to never play the same game twice.  A lot of fun and highly recommended.

It's a fun game but after a few plays it tends to get to be repetative.  The race/power combos help keep it different, but the expand->decline->expand cycle get's old after a few plays.  I like the game, but, it's not one I'd play on a regular basis.

Small World is so much fun.  It takes no time at all to learn, can be played by practically anyone, has a great, fun theme, and is competitive enough without making people super aggressive.  My only complaint is that it's pretty easy to figure out the best races/powers and then the game can get a little repetitive, though still fun!

Not enough choices on each turn.  I feel like once you've chosen your race, you are then locked into a certain optimal play pattern until the next time you get to choose a race.  So, the whole game boils down to 2 or 3 choices.  Meh.

RATING: 8
The thematic elements delight all ages, especially the younger players. But Small World makes it's mark with the decline mechanic, going to and from active, not only choosing when but with what race. Rated for the ingenuity of the character powers with special powers, and the declining strategy which makes this a medium weight game. One of the most requested games in my family group of gamers (boys).

Based on several plays I must say I'm impressed. Days of Wonder have always been one of my favorite game companies when in comes to high-end quality components (regarding both the creativity and quality of these) and story-enhancing elements (you actually PLAY and make up stories when you play their game, instead of just trying to win), and this is no exception. So even though they might "just" have picked up an old game ("Vinci", which I have actually never played) and copied the mechanics almost completely down to the last detail, they have done so masterfully. Definitely a must have for the collection. The expansions just makes it even more perfect

   Small World is very Risk-like, only its duration is limited.  What I appreciate most is the dynamic of races in decline, that gives the game a good ebb & flow.

   It is not a game I would recommend playing with the casual gamer - new player's eyes inevitably glare over once they are faced with selecting their first race / ability combination.

SW has some of the most beautiful components in the boardgaming world. Although the game can be chaotic and prone to kingmaking, it can be fun if played light-heartedly. The biggest concern is that convincing the rest of players that you are not a threat seems like the best way to win.

Quite good, just... not super exciting? This one kind of bores me but I love conflict heavy games so I still like to play it. There are so many good games like this right now that I can't get too excited about mixing and matching powers and then moving chits on a board. It is a strong game, and it is a unique take on area control, I just prefer something old like el grande or something new like blood rage.

RATING: 7
Quite surprised by this game. I had not believed the hype - but after one play, it seems quite decent enough. Better than Vinci.

Overall, the gameplay is super simple. There's not much strategy to this game. Go along and take some territories from your opponents. Score some points for the territories you control. Wash, rinse and repeat. Vanilla Risk is more sophisticated than this. But heaven forbid should the poster boy of BGG-hate dared be compared to the flavour of the month.

Wherein the charm and appeal lie is the hundreds of combinations of powers and races that make this game interesting.

RATING: 6
I've played Vinci once and I liked the game a lot. Small World is basically a updated version of Vinci and it rocks. Obviously there are a few combinations of races and special skills which are killers but I feel that it's not a huge problem and the game is relatively balanced.

RATING: 8
Too much fantasy - bring back VINCI!
However, having said that - it is fun to play. I wish Vinci would have been reprinted however....
For a simple game it seems as though some of the rules could have been made a little clearer. Thank goodness for BGG to clarify.

The bits are an 8, the theme is a 9, but the gameplay is a 6.  I'll average that out to a 7 (i want to go 8 but I can't. Maybe if you add in the expansions).

The game is too kingmakery and attack-the-perceived-leadery for me to truly love it, but the race/power combinations make it a whole lot of fun to play every time you open the box. I liked it enough to buy all the expansions, and I'm glad I did.

Fun, cute game with lots of replay value. My only complaint with the design of the game is the buildup of coins only leads to victory instead of cashing them in for effects, abilities, or any thing else special. Also its hard fora player to get ahead if they are behind if you play a two-player game. It`s best played 3 or more.
Other than that, it`s a fun and flavorful game, and good for casual gamers with an hour to kill.

RATING: 8
This is a really enjoyable game.  I own Vinci, and like that game a lot.  I probably prefer the map of Europe, but the created maps in Small World are also probably more balanced.

All in all Small World feels a tighter game, with a real strategic element.  Because the number of turns is defined, players need to have a good idea of when they plan to decline their Race even in the turn in which they choose it.

A tense and interesting game, a lot of elements need to be taken into consideration - terrain, other players race/special powers, the placement of units on the board, the the eventual waneing of your own races power.  Good fun.

Really great area control game, and another Days of Wonder package that's truly dazzling - particularly the insert for this one. I have so far enjoyed playing the game intuitively, rather than crunching every turn out, and the game has been really engaging this way and still offers players a lot of fun and maintains the satisfaction of a win and the agony of defeat without being too "crunchy". Really looking forward to playing the game more and seeing if certain combos are as overpowered as they seem and how to overcome this. Looking forward to future plays, and playing with more than two.

Small World:

1. Pick a character and say how funny the Witch Kobolds or Dog Shamans are. Ha ha!   The Kobolds are witches!  Ha ha!  How clever!  Ha ha!

2. Identify the leader. Prepare yourself for the whine.  Hear it yet?  No?  Here it is... "But I'm not the leeeaadder!!"

3. Put your Skeleton Hobbits or Gandalf War Bugs or Ghoul Basketweavers where the leader is.  Just stomp all over them.

4. Run out of places to move to in about 3 seconds, because the places to go to are as obvious as a FLAMING ARROW in your chest.

5. Miss a turn. How awesome... extra bonus downtime built into the design!  Give me more!

6. Go to 1, until your head melts out of boredom.

Of every game in this site, this game is the one that I differ with the majority the most.  

The whole idea of starting to build something and then giving it up way, way, way before it really goes anywhere just doesn't appeal to me.     It's like playing Agricola and giving up after taking a stack of wood.

After identifying a good character combo, it becomes "move onto board.  determine who you think is winning.  attack them.  spread.".   Then the player to your left executes the algorithm.  Then the other player.  Then you do it again.  Over and over and over again.  It's like watching paint dry.  Outside of role selection, there is no game here.  The entire game becomes people trying to argue that so-and-so is really the leader. 

Also not crazy about the theme.  Would never choose to play this game myself, but tend to be dragged in to play when others want to.  

Of all of the top 200 BGG games I have played (and it's a good number of them), Smallworld is my least favorite.

Love this game.  Fun, fun, fun, easy to learn (for most people), the right length (for most people), not too brain-burny, but still enough of a challenge to keep my interest.  Only played twice so far, one 4p and one 5p, but looking forward to more plays.  The simple mechanics would seem to give it some gateway possibilities, and it's light enough not to scare off people who aren't the least bit inclined to play something that looks like a wargame to them.  (Plus the art is cute, even if the board's a bit muddy.)

Downside: well, I'd heard this game could have problems with AP types, but I didn't believe it.  Now I do.  Played two games back-to-back.  The 4p game (all of us newbies) went very quickly; everyone caught on immediately, and we had great fun (and were quite surprised at the final scores.)  Then we played a second game -- two from the first game, 3 newbies.  Oy!

One of the newbies picked up instantly.  The other two, whom I'll call Slow and Slower, drove us to distraction.  Slow didn't pay much attention during the rules explanation -- he was distracted by the player aid, which has most of the rules on it anyway.  (I can't complain too much.  A rules lawyer by trade, he caught a few mistakes we made during the game.)  Slower couldn't get over the fact that things didn't work the way they SHOULD.  (He tried to push his pieces from region to another to attack, a la Risk, rather than from attacking from his hand -- every turn.  He complained bitterly that Tritons didn't automatically get the Seafaring ability, which they obviously should have.  Etc., etc.)  And while Slow took for-freakin-ever on his turns, he was a speed demon compared to Slower, who didn't see the point of even thinking about his turn until Slow (who was to his right) finished his turn.  (Oddly, this is a guy who's very funny in real life and in RPGs; BGs seem to turn him into the Grinch for some reason.)  S&S were both figuring ways to "fix" the "obvious flaws" in the game.  (I recommended they try Vinci.)

So, yeah, love this, but I'll be damned careful who I play it with in the future, I think.

Update: this gets fairly frequent play now, plus I've taught it to a number of people at conventions, and it still hasn't gotten stale.  Luckily, the players have mostly been fun.  I've even played with Slow again, and not killed him.

When this was first announced, I thought it was a must-have, and almost pre-ordered it.  After reading some more and considering, I changed my mind about it.  And it stayed changed until my birthday, when I got it along with Cavum and La Citta.  I don't know why I resisted for so long.  Worried it would be too simple?  Turned off by the juvenile fantasy theme?  Maybe.  But the fact of the matter is, Small World is great.  Amazingly addictive, the playing time hits a sweet spot (45min-1hr).  And I always want to play it - it never gets old, thanks to the myriad possible race/abilities combo.  It's one of those rare games that is both a lot of fun, pretty to look at, and easy to learn while at the same time being quite deep.  I'm even into the theme and the races - it's all good, clean, fun that couldn't be juvenile if it tried, simply because the game behind the theme is so good.  Scales amazingly.  Has one of the best inserts out there - it's obvious DoW takes much care with their work.  Seriously, if you don't own this game, go out and buy it.  My 2009 Game of the Year.

It's Risk but without the 3 hour timeframe, the clearly rigged dice rolls and the one guy who hides on Australia only to lose in 2 hours. Okay, maybe it still has some rigged dice rolls, but that's actually part of the appeal in Small World. It's well crafted, the components are of great quality and the game plays well enough to keep me coming back. Also has a great iOS and PC implementation.

RATING: 9
This game has become my second favorite area control game. It works a lot like History of the World, in that the players are discouraged from crazy-face alliances by the shear fragility of their positions and newness of each turn. However, it is much much faster than History, and thus actually gets played, while the amazing HJistory of the World just sits on the shelf awaiting that magical future day when we decide we want to invest 8 hours into a single board.

Also it's got some sweet art and clever humor. It doesn't take itself seriously, and that helps the players not take it seriously.

I have the 6-player expansion for this game.

RATING: 6
It's an improved Vinci, but it still has the key element of Vinci that I dislike: the person who is picked on the least wins.  This makes the game all about politicking and diplomacy which is just something that I don't enjoy.  To win you have to tread the line of scoring enough points each round to get ahead of your opponents but not so many that you paint a target on your forehead. Some undoubtedly enjoy that kind of game, but not me.

The variable sized boards and fixed number of game turns are huge improvements over Vinci and the special abilities have been balanced a little better but there are still exceptions (Dwarves seem underpowered).  I enjoy the fantasy theme ("Look!  Flying Amazons!").  The hidden VP's are a double-edged sword: they speed the game up by eliminating the constant point min-maxing of Vinci but exacerbate the problem of someone getting clobbered into non-contention simply because one or two players "think" that player is in the lead.  The 80 minute playing time on the box must be for a 2-player game.  With 4 or 5 players expect to spend closer to 2 hours - add an hour if it is the first game for a majority of the players (studying all the special powers takes time).  

Unlike Vinci, I will at least play Small World if someone asks, so that really says something about how much better the redesign is to me.

I'm probably more attracted by Vinci's theme but this is a good variation on what is by now a classic conquest game which shortens and simplifies it while adding a few nice touches without losing the essence and it's also very nicely presented, especially if you like nursery bright colours (even on the map!).

Bought today, 24 February 2012 and looking foward to it hitting the table over the weekend - a great and humerous little game, I love the combos of races you can get (Mounted Ghouls, Flying Giants, Diplomatic Orcs etc) and the 'decline race' feature. My only complaint that with additional players the game length really racks up in which case you might decide to play something a little heavier.

Bought this after seeing the review/playthrough on TableTop.

The base game suffers due to not enough races to avoid repeats in a 4+ player game. You really need the expansions (or be creative enough to make new races and tokens) to keep things interesting with race and power combos.

I continue to play Small World, and it continues to charm me. I think the things that make it so attractive are the constant generation of novel situations combined with the nicely-done theme and short playing time, especially with 3 or 4 players (I haven't played with 5, and am not especially eager to). I think if it were any longer it would crash. But it's not, and it's enough for each game to be different and for each decision about which race to play to be interesting and for those choices to play out in interesting ways with just enough tactical details. It's not a "serious" game with any seriously challenging elements or with clever theme or mechanics. But it's fun and engaging throughout, and this is something not to be sneezed at.
---
I'm a bit shocked to be rating Small World so highly, given my strong dislike for Vinci, and also given my generally not-great history with Days Of Wonder (I think this is actually the first game from them that has really charmed me). But I like Small World, as long as it doesn't become too much of a whine-fest (I find whining as a tactical play tedious; I don't mind a little bit of cajoling, but it needs to not get out of hand). It's fun, it's fast, there is some cleverness and strategy to picking your races and powers, and the various abilities have been well-chosen to be flavorful, diverse, and generally powerful enough to be interesting but not overdone.

Who knows if it'll hold up to a couple years of play; it seems somewhat doubtful, alas. But for the time being, I'm finding this to be quite good fun.
---
I really hated Vinci, but got a kick out of Small World. Really, the main differences are: it's much shorter; the scores are hidden; and the theme is fun and well-done. Not a huge amount, but it makes a huge difference. Still a light game, but fast-playing, nicely thematic, and fun. I suspect the sweet spot here is 3-4 players, where with 5 the downtime might become problematic. But I've only played with 3.
---
Why such limited use of dice though? It works well as designed, and dice would not be easy to graft on and might add problematic playing time. But still, it would be fun to see a version of this that is basically the same, but uses dice for combat.

I love Vinci, and Small World managed to improve upon it!  They really cleaned up some rough spots like having to remember how much attack strength you'll need to make a conquest by making all of the information available on the board.  The races and special abilities are all very well-done as well.  

Also, surprisingly good as a fairly quick two-player battle!  Great job DoW!

Fun game. 
Only problem is that if you get targeted by other players, strategy won't save you. 
A lot of kingmaking I think.
Not sure I see a lot of strategy apart from choosing the race.
As meaty as a filler but way too long to be one.
Easy to play with beginner, and usually fun though... Extensions are nice
I keep it for non gamers
EDIT 2017: just played it with 5 and Sarah, it took 10 mins to explain and 75mins to play. Not bad. But still, way to chaotic for my tastes.
I'd trade it by Diane wants to keep it.

This is the first ever game I have pre-ordered and I now have it in my grubby little hands (4/22), now to see how fast I can get it in to play!

Ridiculous!  Finally played it 10/10/09 and this game should have been played 6 months ago, as soon as I got it.  What a terrific game.  I will play another couple of times and then it shoudl probably have a place in my top 10 (probably top 3).  Played with 3 players.  I am excited that it can handle 2, but have the feeling that this will not be a good number to play with.

Very simple rule set.  Very well laid out cheat sheet on the various special powers and races.  Made for a fun euro style wargame.  LOVE IT!

My dreams of an epic game dripping with a kooky level of theme were shattered against a rough, gravelly wall when someone decided to teach me how to play my copy by saying, "Basically, every tile of blah-blah shape does this, and every tile of blah-blah shape does this."  By the end of the night, I felt like I was just putting down tiles, rather than running my miniscule armies around a tiny map.  THANKS FOR TRASHING MY THEMATIC!!

Small World has several good improvements over its predecessor Vinci, but also some serious drawbacks. I still prefer Vinci.

Whether one prefers a fantasy theme or an historical theme is unimportant. However, Small World improves by eliminating certain too weak/too powerful skill combos, which may come up in Vinci. Also, the rules are much simpler in Small World than in Vinci.

However, therein also lies the drawback: The races and skills as well as the map are highly symmetric. There is much less competition for specific places, since only one race can make strategic use of mountains, only one race can use mines, etc. There is no concentration anywhere on the map - all feels the same somehow. So decisions like "Do I go for a quiet spot that yields less points or a crowded spot that yields many points, but which I might not hold long?" are entirely eliminated.

A player thus has more options where to go on the map, but they are all equally bland, so you don't need to plan ahead for your next civilization.

Furthermore, the overloaded graphic design makes the board unnecessary hard to read, e.g. one might mistake the sunny and the shaded side of a mountain as different regions, or distinguishing the races by picture from afar, especially the grey declined sides, is pretty difficult. They are all grey!

RATING: 8
The best thing about this game is trying to find the interesting combos. I also appreciate how hidden points mitigates the bash the leader dynamic that would normally be found in a game like this.

The key tension points are figuring out how to best leverage the combos in order to maximize points, as well as when to decline (again, to maximize points). So, uh, rules manipulation and timing. Which makes the game sound very mechanical and solitary, which is odd, because you are running around killing each other all game.

The art, both in the portrayal of the Amazons and in the decision to only use males for every race that is dual gendered, is unfortunately sexist and was easily avoidable.

Talk about diminishing returns. I like less each time I play. Something about the narrowness of the play and how scripted it feels. I might try it with four or five before I trade it, but I am pretty much over it.

A tentative rating since I've only played it the one time, but damn, what a fun game. It's family-friendly and easy to learn, but with lots of conflict and dynamic play. 

Three games in. I really do like this one. Fast and light, but with enough strategy to keep it interesting.

Based on 1 play with 4 players including the Be Not Afraid, Grand Dames, and Cursed expansions:

By all accounts, this SEEMS to be the kind of game I would like. Short, light area control. It was fun to play and I appreciate the effort to streamline everything, but I feel like in many ways it was smooth and fast at the expense of interesting play. The game feels pretty much void of tense choices. I'm not sure it would stand up to repeated plays.

But first, the good:

There's two cool things at work here. The first is the variability of the races. It's just plain fun to see what comes up next. The way the number of troops you get is based on the mixup of the race/special power works really well. I can't imagine playing just the base game without all the expansions we had is as interesting in this regard, though.

But the main interesting choice you're making is when to decline your race. This is really the crux of the game. But in some ways it's really the only interesting choice you're making. Everything else (which race to choose, where to deploy troops) is sort of straightforward and mathy.

Generally I prefer thinking about short, turn-to-turn tactical choices rather than long term strategy - but this feels TOO short term for even my taste. Apart from deciding when to decline, it's ALL just making the best choice you can for this turn. I don't mind an abstract game but it feels like the game is trying to be themeatic and maybe switching between a bunch of races hurts the theme for me.

Also worth noting: the iconography in this game feels particularly esoteric. MUCH of our first game was spent digging through the rules to find out what certain races/powers did, and the game was only new to two of us.

Update: I keep turning down opportunities to play this. It's just... this game takes something like an hour to play, and there are so very many games that pack way more interesting decisions into that one hour. Hell, I even appreciate ten minute games that offer just one compelling decision to make over and over more than a game like this, where there is maybe one interesting choice to make, but it's not compelling enough to hold up the whole framework around it.

Funny game. It's built the way you are forced to play several races during the game and have no chances to become attached to any of them. 

I also like the presence of female races in the game (in core set there's the only one - Amazons, but three more come with expansion). 

Some combinations are crazy and make the game unpredictable. It's easy to start, easy to explain and easy to play. However for some races you should find right time to bring them to the game.

Some luck involved with what combinations come up after you have chosen your race which can be annoying. Best with four or five players. The two player version is good but not great. 

Downgraded after playing more games. This was my first a bit more complex game and now it feels very basic with not very many choices. But it was great as a starter game.

A funny and beautiful game with a lot of player interaction! It's not one of my favorite games, but I don't have anything like it and I do find it pretty good. There are lots of decisions to make (which race to choose, when to decline, where to attack etc) which all help making Small World an engaging game. 

However, the actual gameplay is perhaps a little dry. You basically do the same stuff over and over, so I don't feel there is a sense of progress over the 8-10 rounds. The combat system is very easy to understand, but that's not a plus in my book; I think the system might be a little too boring as you basically just place some cardboard chits in every single conquest. It isn't even like the different factions get some bonus modifications for defending (except for the bivuaks, troll caves, dragon master token etc, but again, that's just basically some cardboard chit).

Small World scales well for 2-5 players due to the 4 different player boards, but whereas 2 is more chess-like, 5 is pure chaos. I think I prefer it with 4 or 5; with 2 or 3 players I would much rather play a different game. All in all a solid game, but it's not one I'm a huge fan of.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Each game is different as the race/power combos show up differently and make the game feel different. However after a few games it gets to be a bit samey as the difference between the races and powers seems to get smaller.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Lots of fun decisions that affect the game as you go along. Should you attack the empty spots to get yourself more points? Or should you take out your opponents? Should you pay more to get that race you want or save your points and take a "lesser" combo? Should you go into decline or go one more turn?

3) Player interaction: A great amount of player interaction as you can really be totally wiped out if a couple of players gang up on you. So negotiation and strategy are vital to keep yourself alive.

4) Components/artwork: Fantastic artwork and components. Nice box insert. Days of wonders is amazing as always.

5) Game length/complexity:   Perfect game length and complexity. Just as you begin checking your watch the game ends.


Bottom Line: This is one of my favorite games and everyone I teach it to likes it. The area majority/combat player interaction coupled with cool races and powers added to awesome artwork, short game time, and middle complexity makes for a fantastic game. The sameyness of the game each time is the only thing that keeps it from being a 10.

I like to compare this game to Risk.  However, I'm not a huge risk fan and, yet, I consider this to be my favorite game in my collection.  Once you understand the game, it's easy to explain to others and isn't overly complicated.  The best part is, it's built in a completely balanced way, so you can be happy playing with anywhere from 2-5 players.  There are different boards for each number of players, which adds a good amount of variety.  I also love that every game is significantly different because race modifiers are randomized to the races for every game you play, making the game fun and different every time.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys the strategy-style games.

I have a feeling that this game might replace Talisman as my group's go-to game. 

Small World's mechanics were easy to pick up and understand, my friends loved the game's aesthetic, and the relatively short playtime and highly competitive nature of the gameplay left them desperate for more. 

I described Small World to my friends as "Risk for people who don't like Risk," and I think that really appealed to them. What also became apparent when playing the game, is how much it is similar to other Euro-games like Settlers of Catan. 

I want to hold off getting Small World Underground and get some more playtime in on the base game, but I think my group will eventually pressure me into buying it- since they've now discovered their new favorite game.

I've had no problem with board clutter (like many of the nay-sayers out there) and find this game to be a blast every time I play.  The combat system could be a little more interesting, but then I guess it would take a lot longer to play.

Good development of the Vinci system, making a few changes that are generally for the better. Lavish production, as usual from Days of Wonder, particularly the provision of two backprinted boards to give different maps depending on the number of players. Best with four or more players.

I really like this game--the immense variety means you'll never have the same play twice (especially with some expansions), and the light, bright art appeals to wide ranges of potential players. There's some solid strategy here in terms of choosing when to send a race into decline, and I love that certain races and powers are more or less valuable depending on present circumstances. Will play any time!

RATING: 8.5
Excellent Risk replacement with variable powers to keep replay-ability high.  Mechanics of concurring are simple and fast which makes this game a great intro for newbies who want to battle.  Keeping the scores hidden is a subtle but genius mechanic as it eliminates the feeling of hopelessness if you are getting creamed, and it lessens the ability of Min/Maxers to spoil the fun.

**Had many plays before logging.  Mostly 2p.

Fun game for which I bought all the expansions for. However, since there is little "real" strategy here, it is more for mindless fun. 

I bring it out when we have a lot of people over and folks are tired or just don't want to think too much. If you play to have fun and not to win, this game has a lot of potential.

Really enjoy this game. Typically play with two people, which I find to be well balanced. The artwork is silly and good. Good replayability with the mix-and-match race and power tiles. I've had friends complain that there is no "gotcha" elements to the game, no sweeping strategic maneuvers. I guess I can understand that to some extent. Playing with many people is interesting, but can be a bit slow with many new people (as many games are).

Played with Be Not Afraid & Grand Dames expansions. Haven't tried Spider's Web & Royal Bonus yet.

One of my favorite games, a classic easy-to-learn-but-full-of-varieties game that makes you play again and again and again and again. The ability-race mechanic is so brilliant that brings tons of varieties in the game. Want to find a game to enjoy with your best pals? Small World is a perfect choice since it's a very interactive game full of negotiating, backstabbing and joy.

[b]Includes Cursed!, Grand Dames of Small World, Be Not Afraid and Tales and Legends.[/b]

"8" rating after one play, and this could go up. Played as a two player game. What a well-thought-out game! The basic mechanic of grabbing territory is pretty straightforward, but there's all sorts of fun when you start throwing in the race/power combinations. Very enjoyable, and the theme keeps it fun, even though there's a heck of a lot of strategy to this.

Update: now give it a "9". Finally played with more than two people, and I got crushed. But that made we want to play again even more, which I consider a sign of a good game. The race and power combos really make this more of a thinking game than I expected.

Update: played this again after a fairly lengthy layoff, and it's still a 9. I love the crazy combos, especially with expansions included. Fun game with plenty of interesting decisions, and the only thing keeping this from a 10 is the "bash the leader" tendency.

Update: 10 plays now, and this is still a 9. Every time I play this, I enjoy it. And I admire that, with a few relatively inexpensive expansions, you can ramp up or down the complexity based on the players' preference. Couple this game with the "tales and legends" expansion, and every game proves to be unique. This is excellent gaming and highly recommended.

This game is fun, strategic, and engaging, and the varying combination aspect of the races/classes is alone enough to make play-throughs diverse and interesting. Other than that some combinations may be a little too powerful or too weak based on the current game board, I can't think of any significant shortfalls of this game. It's definitely a great game for expansion packs, but is soundly strong without them as well!

Small world is just Vinci with art and replayability. I was amazed at how similar to Vinvi it is, basically duplicating and then adding some fun things to it. There is no doubt the art and theming is ten times better and the game simplier in many ways. However it lacks the appeal I was expecting and in some ways I was disappointed. Still it looks like a great introduction game.

I love Smallworld, despite all the fiddly cardboard pieces. However:
- the box is very badly designed; the coin slots in particular are a joke!
- you're given a blank race banner but no blank race tokens!
- there's not even room in the box for ONE expansion!

Of course, I've made some changes to my copy (the first thing I did was upgrade my Dwarves from 3 to 4!), but you only have to follow my variants if you play with me, so you can borrow my game and use the original rules, however flawed they are ;)

Added some race/badges from expansions (see below), plus:
Coming Soon:
- race: The Mermaids: they can conquer sea/lake regions but get -1 VP for each landlocked territory they occupy. 
- badge: Copycat: allows you to copy any Power from the badges available next to the board. Your active Race benefits from this Power's effect until the beginning of your next turn, or until an opponent chooses the combo with this badge. (When a Power's effect stops, you immediately lose all its Special Power tokens, if any.)

I can understand why this game is popular, but I found it to only be okay.  Definitely not a game I want to own, but I wouldn't be adverse to playing it.  The mechanics are well constructed and not overly complex though more complex than I was expecting from an entry level designer board game.  I actually found myself wanting a little more randomness as I never really pressed my luck with a die roll.  While playing I found myself wanted to play a 'proper' war game, but that is my preference as a player.

Take most of the good bits of Vinci, but not all of them, and then muddle them together with unforgivable randomness, horrendous distracting art, unnecessary hidden trackable information and a game arc that is now so short that is is overcome by the randomness of the random tile draws, thus reducing the significance and interest of the player's decisions in the game.  Not a good reciple. The results are fairly close to dismal, saved only by the few paltry gleams of quality still emanating from the Vinci skeleton.

The saving grace, such as it is, is that the game is also inoffensive.  There are decisions, even if not very meaningful ones, and the game delivers a consistent rate and character of those decisions within the framework of what pretends to be a respectable game.  The result, like the Emperor's new clothes, is less impressive than it portends, but also less offensive than it could have been.

Excellent, game. Area control with a lot of variety. A lot of fun to play, winning often comes down to a few points.

A lot of strategy, analysis and probability in maximizing your points each turn as well as preparing for future turns.

Different numbers of players bring a truly different experience. The more players there are, the more area control comes into play, but the game maintains it's fun factor regardless.

Quite lovely, and there's some extremely clever ideas in there but no real sense of emergent narrative, which inhibits the excitement of the thing. Simultaneously feels too quick (where are the epic confrontations?) and too long (not enough decision points + nothing to do when it's not your turn = a game that feels longer than the advertised running time). Good as an iPad time waster for the subway but I hold my face-to-face gaming time too dear to play this all that often.

RATING: 8
Simple rules, more strategy than luck (but enough luck to make for a diverse game that everyone - in principle - can enjoy), nice artwork and high-quality components make this game great fun! There are so many combinations of races and special abilities, that it will take a while to see them all. However, after seeing them in action once, you will understand the way all abilities and races work and you can easily read their icons in future.

If you do not not consider chit distribution a game and/or need more enticement, you may want to steer away from it. Although I think this is another solid title from Days of Wonder, I have to admit I have not yet seen any game from them that sucked me in less, theme-wise. However, with a vivid imagination, you can still bring this world to life!

2 games (5p) -- I like it OK, especially if played in a lively spirit, but don't want to own a copy. One detail, I like how the value of the various races is a little hard to pin down in a general way, depending not only on the matching special power, but also the timing of their appearance (v. board situation, and end of game). I have trouble with the theme premise, and in that regard would like to try Vinci instead.

DOW strikes it big with this one.  The game scales remarkably well.  The endless possibilities of race-power combos will keep this fresh for many plays to come.  

Combat is simple and furious.  There is a little take-that factor but as everyone is in it to the end, much room for revenge.

Only complaint is that there isn't a comprehensive guide of all the powers with the expansions included.  It gets a bit cumbersome to pass around multiple sheets when looking up abilities.

Giving this a 7 only because my players are 10, 7, and 5.  This game is a bit heavier for them and our first time playing took way longer (due to rule book reading and trying to figure the game out) than most of our other games.  And to be honest, the kids lost interest after the 4th round.

We watched the TableTop episode multiple times to try to better understand the game and it looks great, and seems fun, but perhaps it's just a little deeper than Splendor, Love Letter, Munchkin, or Forbidden Island (our other current favorites).

I intend to watch more play-through videos to give the game another chance, as I believe once I understand it and can quickly guide the kids through the game without consulting the rulebook at every turn, we will all get more enjoyment out of it.  I have very high hopes for the game, thanks to the BGG ratings...

*Update 2 days later*
I downloaded and played several rounds of SmallWorld2 on an Android, which helped me get a much better understanding of how the game works.  It's not nearly as complicated (or overwhelming) as originally thought when I first cracked open the box full of pieces.

I plan to get a few more games on the app under my belt before bringing the kids back into the board game so hopefully by then I'll have a good enough understanding to quickly guide them through a game before they lose interest.

RATING: 6
The production value is great....but the asthetic choices somehow create work for me in playing the game (in comparison with Vinci).  Its just hard to figure out which player is who on the map, with no identifying player colors. Its a minor issue, but I found it really bugging me.

I liked the original Vinci fine (although I did eventually trade off my copy), but the endgame was a mess...since everyone could see when you got close to that winning threshold. The good engine of the game kind of tended to break down at the endgame. Still fun to play, though.

Small World addresses that issue by using hidden VPs and a fixed number of turns. The VPs are trackable, so some will say they aren't really hidden. The fixed number of turns creates some turn issue balance concerns. But overall I don't think they're nearly as big a deal as the discussion on BGG makes them sound.

The fantasy theme doesn't bother me, but in total....there is something about Small World that I don't care for. I acknowledge that its the better, refined, game design compared with Vinci, but I like it less, somehow.

I was a little confused at first on how the whole "go into decline" function worked. About halfway through my first game, the notion clicked and the game's strategy opened up to me. It's not a deep game, but it's fun and colorful, great for a family game with older children able to grasp the nuances.

RATING: 7
I've never played Vinci. I remember seeing it around a bit several years back, but I never ran into anyone who was crazy about it. Combined with the 2 hour playtime, my utter apathy meter was showing 600 megawatts and I just never sat down to play it. I had seen Small World rolling across in the game forums, but I had completely ignored it after I heard the phrase "Vinci variant" attached to it. The Days of Wonder box and fantasy theming didn't make me more enthusiastic when I first saw it. Despite all of this, I eventually sat down to it because trusted gaming friend Josh Miller insisted that it could be worth my while. He was 100% correct.

SW (worst name of the year, easily) is a gamer's light conquest game. It's convoluted enough to drive away the casuals, but light enough to keep from sizzling brain tissue. The basic mechanics of the game are quite simple: you draft armies which are themed to fantasy races, they put cardboard chits on the board. You try to cover territory, and to sometimes kill off other player chits. There is almost no randomness in this, as you simply trade 1-1 chits in most cases when you are occupying a new area. Everything in the base system is simple: start on edges, move to adjacent areas, regather pieces and redeploy them at both the beginning and end of your turn, score a point for each territory, &c. Additionally, you are allowed to "decline" a civilization that has lost too many chits or which seems to have maximized its value. This entails reducing the chit piles down to 1 chit in each area, and flipping them to their grey side. These will sit around collecting VPs as long as they aren't killed off.

The reason why all of the base rules are simple is because of the major hook, the races and powers. The armies you are drafting are two part chits, one part denotes what the race is, the other what their special power will be. The two parts are each represented by separate chits though, so different combinations will happen each game. Sometimes your orks will have flying warthogs to pillage with, at other times they'll simply live in stylish tents during the halcyon Summer days of their youth. In general, the races have thematic special powers that can help them conquer territory or gain more points for holding certain types of terrain while the special powers similarly allow for more efficient attacking, extra points, and so forth.

I'm not generally a big fan of combat-oriented games, but this title hits just about every sweet spot I have in the genre. It has randomness in the race/power draft, but it doesn't seem to overwhelm the decision making and almost purely non-random board play (it's not 100% pure because there is a die roll that players can make to try and take one last territory when they don't have sufficient chits to do so otherwise, it's useful but not a live and die type roll). The race/power chit concept promises to give plenty of different combinations to toy with, and hence, a differently textured game each time. I will grant that certain combinations seem extremely powerful (i.e.: Sorcerers with Merchants in our last 4 player game led to havoc, the controlling player was able to score 18 each round for a few rounds in a game where 12 seems like it would normally be a very solid turn) but if they prove to be issues in the long run it wouldn't be difficult to institute house rules or to just ditch the offenders, as I assume there will be expansion races and powers both fan-made and official in the not too distant future.

In sum, for a game that I had no interest in playing, and was almost dragged to the table for, I ended up impressed. SW is an engaging, relatively short, and flat out fun release. Easily the best game that I've played in the DoW catalogue and there is definite longevity potential. Possibly too limited for regular play in an overall sense, but I'll be playing this quite a bit for the foreseeable future. If the game's overall replay ends up being good this rating will likely go up. Though the special power combinations seem like they will add life, my main concern is that the overall basic nature of the map play will mean that the game would feel very samey with too much play.

RATING: 3
So far I have only played this game on an Ipad against the AI (I only log games against humans) and the experience has left me cold.  This is a bit of a throw back to the kind of simple conflict game that was mainstream in the 1980's. However Small World2 stands out as particularly abstract and dry.  Why not simply play Risk or one of its many clones.

On the Ipad History of the World stands out as much better game and the cardboard 8 Minute Empires meets the same need in a much more wallet friendly manner.

Why is this popular, clearly their is nowt as queer as folks?

There are not enough 'quick', easy multi-player conflict games and this helps to fill the gap (although I think Chaos ITOW does it better). The board is a bit generic but the mixed fantasy roles are fun. After more plays the setting up and packing away all the pieces is becoming annoying and the game play is a bit bland. Seems more like a filler than a main game.

One of my favorite games, The unique races really add such a different game experience each time.  That said, I don't enjoy the sequel as much because there are less starting races.  However the Special Items and Places are good, so it's worth getting just to add those items to the base game.

RATING: 5
This game is overrated. It is decent at max but rather only mediocre.
There are broken combos, way too much downtime. Usually you should all -as a group- care about the guy who's ahead which in practice means if you do, you lose. If you don't and do your own things then you will never catch the one who's ahead. It is a lose-lose situation.
Also way too much downtime and too little interaction. You cannot plan ahead because situations will change after every player so you can leave to room till your turn comes again.

Very similar to Vinci but that's ok. This is a fine game but not my favorite type. I don't think the strategy is too deep either. The win is more about politicing to convince others you are not in the lead.

A simple little game with a lot of built in variety. I've now played it with all the player combos (I think) and have enjoyed every game. The production is excellent although the plastic insert is perhaps just a bit too perfect... After only a few games I've given up on the race token tray and am just bagging them. We'll have to see how long the rest of the inserts last. But it's a nicely cleaned up version of Vinci that I'm very happy to have in my collection.

Stratego meets Cave Troll meets Smash-Up.  There are a couple OP combinations out there, but that's why this game is better with 4 people.

RATING: 7
An interesting beast. It's a psudo-skirmish game with a very light tone to it overall. The idea is players each take control of a random race with a random 'class' of sorts, which allot them a set amount of 'soldiers'. Players then get to place their soldiers around the map, taking over other players territory (Thus causing them to permanently lose soldiers). The more territory you own, the more gold you get (Not too dissimilar to Risk in a way). 

The interesting aspect though is the game isn't designed to allow you to keep the same race/class combo for the entire game. It's quite natural to have your 'civilization' decline and eventually be wiped out, in which case you buy a new one and continue on with the new combo until they too are sent into decline and you must replace them.

It's a very 'combat lite' game, which is nice for new playera and for vets who want an easy play. Rules are pretty simple, and some of the random combinations for Races and Classes can be stupidly good or just average at times. Yet some combos are just hilarious in concept, like Giants who are Sailors, or Hobbit Dragonriders.

Expansions breathe new life into the core game for a cheap price, usually offering 3 or so races AND classes to the game, making repeated plays of the game fresh as it feels you'll be surprised to get the same combo of Race and Class twice (Quite rare). 

Pretty family friendly all said and done, and enjoyable for casual players and seasoned tabletoppers as well.

Looking forward to more plays to see how things shake out.

Yeah, it's better than Vinci. But I'm not sure that's saying much, since I will never play Vinci again. Actually, that's only partially true. I only vowed never to play again with public points. Or with people who play so slow (or who with photographic memories) who can track the hidden points. I detest the bash the leader, which is universal is the games (of Vinci) I played before switching to hidden points. Small World does this by default. The civs also just seem more fun, and killer (or loser) combos are eliminated by having a civ attribute and a civ modifier attribute (i.e. 1 attribute form each of two pools, rather than twoattributes form one pool). This is goodness. The other goodness is with a few extra bits to mark special abilities on the board, you can pretty much always do your turn without having to worry about anyone else's civ. E.g. things like defense bonuses have cardboard bits to indicate them. Even mountains. So just count the bits and go. At the end of the day it still feels pretty tactical, but it looks nice (ok, yeah, the board is a little garrish, but not like Metropolis bad, and not to the extent that it affects functionality--the pieces in decline also caused me no trouble--I don't understand the complaints) and plays very smoothly. Something which feels like a return to a core strength of a DoW game. And the separate boards for every player number (a la Evo--in fact the board even looks like an Evo board) means it plays pretty much equally all player numbers (modulo a few abilities that work better/worse with more/fewer players).

Lots of fun, beautiful components.  Induces some fun trash-talking.  Every game feels a bit different because the race/special powers combo are so many.

Przyjemna gra na leniwe popołudnie z rodziną lub spotkanie w większym gronie znajomych. Proste zasady i dynamiczna rozgrywka, można zagrać kilkoma rasami w ciągu jednej partii - dla jednych będzie to zaletą, dla innych wadą. Duża liczba żetonów znajdzie swoje miejsce w specjalnych przegródkach. Jedyne co można tej grze zarzucić, to jest strasznie kolorowa, wręcz pstrokata i czasem ciężko zauważyć, co dzieje się na planszy. Mnie osobiście nie urzekła po pierwszej rozgrywce.

This game is an average, solid game. Two major complaints:

1) Once you choose your race, the remaining choices are pretty obvious. Not much strategy or creativity here, which makes it less exciting.

2) The artwork on the board is EXTREMELY busy. This makes it very difficult to see your pieces, especially when multiple players' pieces are upside down (which makes them all grey in color). It's a problem.

I don't liked it, because of its monotonic gameplay. Yes - you can change races every time you decide so, you can overtake others players regions, use some powers to gain more gold or reinforce your region etc. etc. But still - there is not much i need.

After all this is game for beginners or average players, family plays, fun time spending (maybe).

Like I`ve said before I like good visual appeal in games and the use of combinations that provide variety. The many possible combinations of traits and creatures intrigues me no end. With the realms expansion I can let
my creativity run wild. No two games will ever be the same. The claustrophobic feel of the game board really
amps up the decisions to be made in this game. Have no reason to buy Vinci its forerunner since the make over
is exquisite. Days of wonder really adds quality to their
productions.

Neat original euro game concept.  Players pick unique races that are randomly matched with tiles that give various unique abilities.  Players place their race game pieces on the various board spaces each turn and score points for all areas they occupy.  Once a player's race diminishes, the player may opt to put the race into decline and then proceed on a future turn to pick a new race.  The game requires strategy and it is combat oriented as you should attack other players pieces to take their territories.  Dice rolling is used to resolve attacks.  There are several expansions out for Small World.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A solidly designed game with attractive components.  The mix of powers and races will keep things fresh, and there is enough balance to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead.  I enjoy the light level of conflict - not enough to cause bitterness between players.  I've upgraded my rating a little, as I like how much the game changes based on the number of players.  Replayability is strong with this game.

suffers from the same problems as Vinci, and the additions such as the dice aren't particularly interesting.

Graphics look pretty, but aren't particularly easy to use, particularly when telling the difference between different declined empires.

Small world, crazy game with very little strategy, always maximizing every turn for how many points you get, regardless of how many units you lose.

System for randomizing player sides is nice.

The game goes against the 8th general preference about games in my profile.
I stripped another full rating point for the particularly misplaced hidden trackable information (HTI) rule about the Victory Coins (see my 6th general preference for why I don't like any HTI in games and detract at least -0.5 rating points for any noticeable HTI). I would like Small World considerably better with a normal VP track which shows the current VP of all players. This would also alleviate the multiparty-conflict problem alluded to above: At least it would be much easier to specifically target the leader.

Components: Great looking board and race/power tiles that do a great job of evoking the theme.  I really appreciate the sealable case for all the tokens.

Experience: It's fun to select a race from those available, and to wield their special powers and try to entrench them on the board, so that they might prosper even during decline.  Lots of tug-of-war going on, and opportunities for strong offensive and defensive play.  Still, for the most part, I expand my race as quickly and as far as I can, then send them into decline. Choosing a race is more interesting than actually employing that race.

When you hear the name "Days of Wonder", its a good bet that the game looks great, plays great, and will hit with most gamers and non-gamers alike.  I've not played a DoW game I didn't love.  Small World is no exception.  The core mechanics are a snap to learn, and the handy reference sheets make learning the special powers no problem to pick up as you go.  There is limitless replayability, with the method that special powers are paired with the different races, making each game truly unique.  The comedic fantasy theme works well, and can provide laughs all on its own.  The fact that it comes with 4 unique boards to balance the game for 2-5 players is genius.

The heart and soul of the game are the races with their own native abilities and a randomized power, giving the game high marks for replayability.

Easy to learn. Lots of fun to mix-n-match the different monster combos. My game group loves it. It's worth it to get one or two of the mini-expansions to add some variety, but some of the bigger expansions seem like over-kill. Keep it simple and slaughter-full.

RATING: 8
Great game. The art style is very appealing and the theme is well done. Easy to learn and jump right into. Very little reliance on luck. Having to choose from a random pool of power and race combinations ensures that players have to mix up their strategies from game-to-game rather than falling back on old standbys. There are some minor imbalances but superior tactics typically result in victories. The game is just the right length and ends exactly when you're ready for it to without overstaying its welcome.

Some players might be turned off by the Fantasy theme, but in my opinion it was a smart move by Days of Wonder to re-theme Vinci. Fantasy sells far more than Ancient Greece. The rules changes are fine; I don't think they detract from the original experience created by Vinci. If I was to have one gripe it would be that the board can look a bit cluttered with all the tokens. Fantastic game.

A much better version of Risk with a VP-scoring system.  There is also strategy, especially in deciding when to go into decline.

But the expansions make some race combos entirely too OP.  More importantly, however, the game gets boring because in most turns there is an obvious or semi-obvious optimum move.

Great Game! I would consider this a gateway game for most. I have no problem playing this with people who don't enjoy board games very much. I usually pull this off my shelf first and I have never had anyone tell me they did not enjoy the game. Only downside is in larger games sometimes it can take a long time to come back to your turn, some people are not a fan of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the game, the theme and the ease of bringing in new players into it with its easy to teach rules (despite needing a cheat sheet of abilities to sit with each player during the game, but those are provided). The only negative with it is I find once you have a good grip of how to take over things effectively, the meaningful decisions disappear due to mathing out the best plan of attack with little variance. Of course you simply don't have to do that, but it feels like a self-imposed handicap sometimes. Also subject a bit to becoming a kingmaker, but the fun of playing is always there. Good game.

This is the game that got me into the hobby in 2013. This is still one of my favourite games. Some pick on the leader issues but you never really know who the leader is. There's so much variability to this game with the expansions due to the races and power combos being separate items that rarely come up the same. Not a deep area control game but lots of fun and the art is so good.

20+ plays prior to logging. We played the crap out of this game when we first got it! Funnily enough we played it wrong almost every time, and yet it balanced.

RATING: 6
It's a good game, excellent to introduce new players to board games. Relatively simple area control game with various races, each bringing some unique abilities. However, after playing other games I just don't feel like going back to this one. Simply put, Small World does not leave any impression on me anymore. The "childish" theme and design does not help either. Therefore I rate it only 6, despite the fact it's good overall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 8.5
I appreciate SW very much, turns flow well, easy rules (except some fiddly combos), tons of replayability, low luck factor, the (sometimes distorted) perception that everybody is in the game until the end. 
Fantasy theme also helps in my group, thou its fundamentally an abstract game.

First few games make it seem a very light strategy game but after that you really start admiring the small subtleties. What combo do I choose and what combo do I leave to the next player? Do I wait another turn for declining and settle for an average score or do I risk choosing a new race for a possibly better one? No simple task.

Also the meta-game has a HUGE importance in my group do to the hidden vp. There's always raging discussions during my games, players pointing out that somebody has gotten the advantage after a good turn and that player denying and debating that from now its only going to get worse etc. 
Typical sentence that comes out after a player has scored 10 vp in the last turn or has just got a combo with amazons is "There's a new enemy in town.." And this brings us to all sorts of different approaches and considerations, for instance, dwarfs - most unpopular of all races - might be chosen just to keep a low profile! 
I enjoy this meta-aspect very much (thou I often lose because of it). 
All in all an excellent game.

It's an ok game... but i won't go out of my way to play it.
Strategies and tactics are awfully limited compared to other games. What factions you take will mostly dictate the rest of the game.
I feel like you have a meaningful decision when you select your race, then just go with the flow afterwards doing actions that don't really require you to think much.

Puede resultar un buen juego introductorio. Por contra, al cabo de algunas partidas se hace monótono y repetitivo. El único interés está en saber elegir las mejores combinaciones de raza y habilidad, la mayoria de las veces los movimientos en el tablero son un mero trámite, previsibles y con escaso margen para la estrategia.

RATING: 7
A fun game with an element of luck through dice rolling, or, perhaps, better described as a push your luck element. There are a couple of strong strategies that other players need to watch for and guard against. There are a lot of points generated after formal game end and this is a bit of a distraction for me. But, I will play it and it is a good transition game for new players.

RATING: 8
A wackily themed game that looks great. It's always a blast to attack my friends with the Historian Gypsies, Berserker Elves or some other outlandish race. The power/race mechanic allows for a lot of replayability and there are a ton of tactical decisions to be made in Small World. The hidden victory points are a great mechanic that allows for some really surprising wins. You never get the feeling that you are out of the game until the very end! Small World is a really cool combination of a wargame and a eurogame.

Extremely easy to learn.  But way too easy to master.

The trick to this game is to compare the map to the available races+powers and thus calculate point potentials.

2-4 players, 30 minutes, light medium, tableau building

Have played with 2, 3 and 4 players and all work quite well. The game has different boards for the various number of players, so it will always be a world too small for everyone, which ensures there's plenty of action :) The game looks great and the numerous combinations of races and special powers (which are different every game) ensure that replayability is high.

Simple rules, the gameplay is as strategic and tactic or as "simple" as you want, you can play a game under 2 hours even with complete newbies.
The luck part is just fine: enough so that you can't mechanically play your game, you have to adjust to it, but it is not so important that any any thinking would be pointless

RATING: 7
A simplified, prettified version of Vinci.

Choosing race a turn after you decline is a massive improvement - giving folk a turn to make their decision and helping to minimise delays.

Some of the special powers - like the Elves/Skeletons/Trolls - are more exciting.

Mountains are the new forests, old mountains are defunct, cohesion is gone, cardboard exists to make counting easier...

There's still a bit of strategy to be employed here but it feels a lot closer to the light game that Vinci was trying to be.

2010-06-15
Even with the VP sweeteners, some race/power combos are far superior so there is a sizable amount of luck here.

The number of races/powers can slow the game down a bit as you try to evaluate them all.

Other than that, it's a light game that I would probably be up for reasonably regularly. I imagine it being slightly more fun once I've seen all the powers/races at least once.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think the best thing Small World has going for it is its short play time.  If you have a few players and want something fun but relatively quick it is a great choice.  My main complaint is that the game is really all about timing your decline and that's about it.  Due to the game's length you'll probably only get two, maybe three races in the game so it just feels a little flat; there's no real arc to the game, just you doing the same thing for an hour or two until you see who has the most points.

Not bad, just not nearly as exciting as I thought it might be.

EDIT: Plays much better with three.  I think I've only played it with five previously and that really isn't much fun.  Three was surprisingly enjoyable.

The very first game played on Wil Wheaton's TableTop and one of the first games I bought once that show started airing on YouTube, Small World is an area control game where you play as various fantasy races with outlandish powers. With the many different races and powers in the base game not to mention the many expansions, Small World is a fun strategy game to sit with your friends and play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The combinations of races and special powers is really fun and make replay value really high.  Great theme and strategy.  It is a little intimidating to teach to new players, but it is not too heavy.  Even new gamers can pick this up with a little patience.

Race selection really balances the game by allowing you to chose any of 6 combinations and making passed over races more and more valuable as the game goes on.  The expansions are fun and add even more combinations.

This is my favorite game.

This is lots of fun and surprisingly strategic. You need to plot out where you want to go using your particular strengths, grab as much land as possible, and hold on. The biggest decision is when to go into decline in order to grab a good upcoming race before someone else can, and I think my friends don't really grasp this when they say the game isn't interesting. The retheme and refinement of Vinci was well done, although I could have done without the dopey fantasy artwork.

I generally boycott all things disney, and the artwork in Small World too closely tries to emulate that cartoony, childish style.  I have considered buying both small world and underground expansions and burning all the species that are offensive to my sensibilities.  I would start by burning the spider ladies and selectively covering their appearance on the box art.  If you're prepared to make such a purge (or print some better fan-produced alternatives onto sticker paper to cover them), what remains will be excellent.

Small World is a great strategy game that is fun and flavorful. I love that there's a limited amount of turns which keeps this game from getting drawn out for waaaay too long. There's decent replayability due to race and bonus power combinations always being different. I also like that there are different boards for different number of players. That helps that game scale a lot better than other games do.

SooooOOOOooo much better than Vinci.  I really didn't much care for Vinci's length and metagame.  SmallWorld addresses pretty much every issue I had with the original game.  It's short and sweet, with lotsa kewl and evocative powers and races.  It's a bit too confrontational for the noobs, but it's a great long-filler for experienced gamers and people who wish direct conflict.  I'm particularly fond of the iPad version of the game, as it's easy to burn 15-20 minutes even now that I've played a bajillion times...

Perhaps this is the best that you can get, regarding only the area control mechanism.

A lot of things are very well designed in this game:
-The way by which the characteristics of the different species are settled is very ingenious and funny;
- The need to extint one of your two species before starting a 3rd one is nice;
- The ideia that an extint species can still provide income until being totally wiped out is also nice;
- The several specific powers of each race give strategic depth into the game;
- The combats resolve through simple dice throwings but these can be mitigated by the specific characteristics of the grounds and the species involved;
- The game has very easy rules, the characteristics of the species are easily understood by the way of the drawings and the game goes fast and can be over in about an hour.

A game always enjoyable of being played.

Simple turn actions but a decent amount of complexity with the race and special powers. Sometimes plays a bit longer when it should depending on player speed, though turn count decreases at higher player counts.

Avoid Leaders (maybe), Necromancer island, legends, 6 player map, and realms expansions?

There are many reasons I love this game, but one of the biggest reasons it is so good is the multiple boards for different player counts.  It scales perfectly because of that design, which makes it easy to pull out more often.  The fantasy theme, the nice/goofy art, the ability to change races mid-game and seek revenge, and the fact that the game lasts a set number of rounds makes this easy to introduce to new gamers.  The random combinations of races with special powers keeps each game interesting, although I have had the situation come up a few times where an "overpowered" combination comes up and skews the entire game, but that's a rare occurrence. I would highly recommend this game, and enjoy it each time we bring it to the table.

It is an excellent game.

I like the fact that the mechanics are easy to learn but difficult to master.

Choosing the most adequate race + character combination for the current situation is quite difficult. 

I always find it hard to go into decline and change race but it really puts you into a new game every time you decline.

RATING: 7.5
Very good game - cool mechanics.  A bit of a learning curve because of the diversity of the options - you have to understand what each race and power does before proceeding.  Spent some time referring to charts for this, but other than that it flows well and has some good tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good improvement on the Risk model. The Decline mechanic gives a good ebb and flow to a player's strength on the board.

However, there can be some king-making, and some race/power combinations can be better than others.

RATING: 8.5
A fun for everyone version of Risk you might say. It gets to our table a lot more often than Risk too. Every game is unique which makes for great replayability and it's generally a hit. With new players, there's a delay in getting to understand what each class advantage is - but it's not a long delay - or anything that ruins the experience.

A very engaging area control game, with some really great power combinations. I have taught this game to quite a few people, and the most difficult aspect to explain is "going into decline," but the game also lends itself well to giving a super brief overview of the game and jumping right in and teaching as you go. Highly recommend!

No val marcar-se una estratègia inicial, doncs dependrà sobretot de què et facin els altres xD, i també de la raça que tinguis, i les races solen perdre poder al llarg de la partida, de manera que podem canviar un parell o tres de vegades de raça, i per tant canviarà la nostra estratègia.
Hi ha moltes races (14) i poders especials addicionals que es combinaran de forma explosiva, fent que cada partida sigui diferent.
És un joc força divertit.
2012: compro dues expansions (Grandes Damas i Malditos) amb lo qual tinc 5 races i 7 poders més.

I've really enjoyed the 2-player Small World games I've been able to play, but I think it'd be fantastic with three or more players, where you can form alliances and gang up on a leader.  Artwork is excellent. Needs a few plays to get the hang of the strategy.

Update: I've played this now with 4 players and alliances didn't form and it felt kinda chaotic. Also a little too hard to introduce to new board gamers, so I wouldn't use it as a gateway game.

The humorous and wonderful characters and powers are what make this game fun. Unfortunately, stripped of its theme-dependent charm, it's only a good game, not a great one... so after you've seen and laughed at the flying trolls and dragon master halflings a few times, you're left with a relatively ordinary game.

Smallworld, aka the last Days of Wonder money sucker "pimp my game".

Smallworld takes a classic german game, Vinci (which I rate 7), and tries hard to fix some of the minor issues of the game.

More specifically, the following "problems" are tackled:
a) bland and uninspiring graphics
b) poor scalability
c) occurrence of populations featuring overpowered combinations of abilities
d) occurrence of some "bash the leader" situations
e) convolution of some rules
f) possibility of "very long" games, not desirable in the new "cult of the short game"

Unluckily, almost all the fixes are not real improvements over the old game. indeed:
a) the map and the tokens now features cartoon style drawings. unfortunately, the races tend to be undistinguishable, especially when the races are declined, since all the drawings are green. This naturally worsen in not optimal (artificial) lighting conditions. (-0.5)
b) The multiple map is a genial solution to the scaling issue, and really solves the problem (+1)
c) the introduction of race+ability allows for more control on wild powers combination, yet greatly reduce the number of possible couples. I know that this will be solved with a plethora of expansions. I strongly dislike it, since reveals once again the greedy DoW policies (-0.5)
d) the "bash the leader" issue has been 'solved' with hidden victory points. This only turns the "bash the leader" to the even worse "bash the supposed leader", which poisons the game with a rather disruptive "Diplomacy" metagame (-1).
e) Rules have been dumbed down, removing the empire coesion and the forbidden active and declined neighboring rules. Several strategical choices are consequently considerably reduced (-1).
f) The problem of "long" games have been solved with a fixed number of turns. Unfortunately, the number is so short that there is not lot of maneuver space about decline choice(-0.5)
Conclusion: please give me back my old Vinci!

RATING: 8
- Gameplay and replayability: 4/4. Small World is a thoroughly enjoyable game which plays quickly, without much downtime. The game requires strategy, but without hurting the brain too much. It has lots of interaction, making it a very social game. And last but not least, there is a lot of variety because of the different races. The expansions add even more variation, which only benefits the game.    

- Absence of luck: 4/4. Small World has a luck factor in that the available races are random. However, this is fully mitigated because of three observations. First, the player can choose between 6 random races, so you'd need a lot of bad luck to find absolutely no combination that has some strength. Secondly, it is very unlikely that one player has all the luck in the 3 times a race is to be selected during the game, while the other players have no luck at all. Third and most importantly, in a more-than-2-player game, when other players notice that someone is scoring heavily, they tend to attack this leader, leveling out his advantage. Therefore I dare to say that the luck factor never determines the winner. In a 2 player game, the luck factor is reduced to a minimum because during the first race selection, the chance that 5 out of the 6 available races are bad is almost zero.  

- Duration: 4/4. 45 minutes with 2 players, a bit more than an hour with 3 and 1.5 hour with 4. This means that you don't need to spend a whole afternoon, and it is even possible to play twice on a single evening. 

- Player range: 4/4. Equally fun with 2, 3 or 4 players.

- Theme and looks: 4/4. The fantasy theme is kept light and funny. It surprises me how well the races' special abilities integrate with the theme. Most of them feel natural and plausible, supporting the theme and making them easy to remember. But if there is one thing Small World excels at, it is the artwork. The race graphics are beautiful and the board is absolutely gorgeous. I keep looking for fascinating details I hadn't noticed before. Wow, just wow!   
- Set up/clean up time: 3/4. It takes some 5 minutes to set up and another 5 to clean up.

- Learning curve and documentation: 2/4. The rules can be easily explained, but a newcomer will need some time to understand the abilities of each race. Luckily the races come available one at a time during the game, so they don't have to be studied all at once. However, the problem is the rule book. The basic rules are clear, but the race specific edge cases are often explained too concisely, leaving room for interpretation and discussion. Also, you will often need to read both the explanation in the rule book and the one on the reference sheet, as they both provide only part of the information needed. 

- Durability: 3/4. Good quality components. The (very handy) box for storing the races seems a bit fragile though.

- Portability: 1/4. Not suited for traveling.    

- Like: gorgeous looks, strategic, light and fun to play, short, plays well with any number of players, lots of variation, tiny luck factor, fast setup. Small World has it all!

- Dislike: edge cases are badly documented and hard to remember, but now I'm nitpicking :-)

Essentially a tweaked Vinci, with more or less the same strengths and weaknesses, but a busier map. The theme will be more interesting than Vinci to some people. I enjoy playing from time to time.

Really good game, the only thing that didn't make much sence to me was that people were just grabbing different races every 3 or so turns. It wasn't that big a deal and I still enjoyed it, but I would have rather that your race "evolved" than just grabbing a compleltely different one each time.

Gets big points for novelty, at least for someone who has not played Vinci, and also for enjoyment. The 'special powers overkill', however, likely will keep it off my top-25 list. Even after many plays, I'm still referring to the cheat sheet to be reminded of how the available races and powers function, and ambiguities about their interaction frequently send me to the BGG forums for clarification after a game. Letting much time pass between plays makes it worse.

Likes: Light, fast to teach, accessible for a variety of gamers. Components are well made. I like how DoW includes different boards depending on the number of players. Box is well designed. Just enough tactical decision making, to off-set the sometimes chaotic nature of the games. 

Dislikes: As mentioned above, games can sometimes feel chaotic and out of the players control. Some race/power pairings are broken and allow one player to run away with the game.

I've tried to like Small World, I really have, but it just falls flat for me.  The change of races is a cool mechanic, but with the area-control, you're constantly just swapping territory with the other players. There's no attachment to your territory. Others seem to like it though and there's some good opportunity for comebacks, so that gains it an extra 0.5.

[2009-10-16 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]
Note: This is my rating after two games. It is likely to be changed after further plays, as I'm still a little unsure about this game right now.

At it's core, Smallworld is a rather abstract game about conquering and holding regions, as after a turn you are awarded coins (read: points) for each region you hold with one of your races. Be the one with the most coins at the end of the game - triggered after a set number of rounds - and you win. In order to prevent king-making, the coins are kept hidden. All this is spiced up by variable player-powers introduced through random race-power-combinations and your ability to decline a race and choose a new one. While you can't conquer any new regions with a declined race, they do give you points for the regions they are still in. So each turn you are faced with a nice dilemma: Do I put my current race into decline or not? Is there a new race available that will benefit me more in my current situation?

Comments:
---------------
* It's all about maximizing your score. Don't get to attached to your race as there is a real need to decline it in order to maximize your score. Because of this, I had the feeling, that I wasn't really achieving something. A turn was more like a puzzle or a one-shot opportunity: "Okay, given this situation, how can I get the most points". This effect is a little lessened by some of the race-power-combinations as you can divide them into different groups: Some are good to get points quickly, some are better in decline and some have a better staying power while active. So in a way, with the selection of a race-power-combination, you can kind of formulate a strategy. But I don't know, if this enough for me.

* I'm not so sure, if you can really plan ahead during the other players turns. In my only three-player game, the map changed significantly between my turns. All I had to do then, was to look innocent so no one would attack me. It was okay since I was playing with quick gamers. But I can see this become a problem in five player games where some of my opponents take forever for their turns.

* While the map looks beautiful, I would complain that it is sometimes quite hard to figure out what's going on. I read, that this was a bit clearer in Smallworld's 	predecessor Vinci. But maybe this was a design decision, since you can't see who is in the lead so easily.

A very complete game, in the sense that the gameplay, to me atleast, is very good. There's lots of replayability, due to the many different configurations of the races and special abilities. Every combination makes you consider the tactical advantages/disadvantages. 

There are some rules that are somewhat unclear and that we've had to houserule in my group, but they've been easy to overcome, leaving the rest of the rules very balanced and easy to understand (apart from the dwarves, jesus). 

Having played the game quite a few times, it is a game we every so often return to in my group. Haven't played any expansions, but the core game is a solid 8 in my opinion.

Things that make it not a 10 - the dwarves, some unclearities in the rules.

By description, this sounds perfect.  By play, there are a few flaws (board is hard to read in a few cases), but it's nearly perfect for me.  I love Vinci, and I love fantasy themes.

A dumbed down version of Vinci. I really don't see the point in taking apart a good, nay, excellent game, throwing away most of the good parts, but adding loads of meaningless chrome, luck, and a daft fantasy theme.

Firstly - IT'S NOT A WARGAME.

Enjoyed this a lot. The Race v Special Power combos add lots of variety, as well as being amusing ('Beserk Halflings') and need careful thought about how useful they will be and how to use them. Timing your civ's 'decline' is also crucial.

Component-wise this is excellent - good quality cardboard tokens with good artwork beat plastic figures 9 out of 10 times.

Was getting a bit of a hump with 'Days of Wonder' after the far from stellar Desert expansion for 'Memoir 44' (poor and expensive figs for their cash-cow) but this and the Memoir 44 campaign book have restored my faith.

Vinci is a great game.  I know Vinci.  This, sir, is no Vinci.  The only improvement it has is the brilliant idea of providing different maps for different number of players.  The other changes are all downhill.  

Left/right split for powers makes way fewer combinations.  Hard turn limit takes all of the drama out of late game declines.  Streamlining the forest/mountain rules is okay, but using the giant icon-covering mountain cutouts to do it is just massive Graphic Design Failure.  There is a reason newer printings of Vinci made those symbols bigger.  

And speaking of awful Graphic Design, the super-bright happy kid art looks nice, but it makes it just impossible to see your guys when you have Flying or Underworld.  And then in decline your pieces mute even further.

I prefer it over Vinci.  Plays faster and offers equivalent strategy/choices.  I'm a fan of theme and Small World tops Vinci in this category as well.  Both good games though.  I think many Vinci fans will snub Small World because of the short-cuts it takes.

I like this game in a general sense, but I am somewhat concerned that the ability to convince others that you are not winning has an equal or great importance than the other aspects of winning the game. That trait by itself is not enough for me to mislike the game, but the impact it appears to have in this game is enough to cause my desire to play this game decrease, and might be enough for me to end up disliking it entirely.

RATING: 5
Players control races with abilities, and try to earn victory points by conquering areas of a map that is rather ... small!  Essentially a remake of Vinci, an excellent game from several years ago.  The theme has been ported to a fantasy genre, and several rules have been stripped out, the rule of cohesion being the most vital.  We're left with a very colourful game with a good dose of the whimsical (flower smelling elves, drunk dwarves, etc).  They have taken a few house rules we had been using for Vinci and added them here (hidden victory conditions - good!), which improves the game.  The addition of different boards for different numbers of players is also a good thing.  Graphically, it's very colourful and attractive, but terrible to play on - very hard on the eyes - Vinci is much better in that respect.  An excellent game, and great to see it back in print.  However, the presentation from a game play perspective is a step in the wrong direction from the original game.

I love the art style and light-hearted theme.  I also love the fun combinations of races and powers.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much strategy in the combat decisions, but I've mostly played only 2 player so far. I need more plays with more than 2 people to get a better feel for how strategic the combat is.

Update: After another play, this time with 4 players, I'm just not feeling this one.  It felt a bit boring.  All the strategy is in the decisions about what race to choose, deploying the race doesn't seem to present many interesting decisions. Putting this up for trade.  It's a decent game but I can't imagine myself going out of my way to play it again.

Update: math traded.

Area control; Area movement; Variable player powers; Territory building;
On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race to occupy territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go "into decline".

06/01/2012: After 3 plays, I'm rating this a 7. I definitely want to play more games (as do Ali and the neighbors), but it feels like too many lackluster Special Power/Race combinations can really hurt the flow of a game.
Today we saw some real stinkers, like Diplomat Humans and Hill Elves, which had 3-4 VP on them by the time they were selected.
Perhaps we are holding onto our Active races too long?

I want to like this game more. Maybe the expansion races will help boost this one to an 8.

Idea:
Pick your race to conquer the world and when their power diminishes switch to another to continue conquering.

Mechanism:
 Each player first choose race. First race is free and next is 1vp token from you to that race. Then conquer regions. Each race is formed of base (troll/goblin/human etc) and ability (fortified/berserk/pillaging). Amount of men you get depends on those two, thus good abilities give less men and poor abiliites give more.
 After race pick you go for map and conquer regions, 2 men more than tokens on there (thus if map has 2 defenders on a mountain [which is token] and fort [token] they have strength of 4 and you need 6 to take over. After take over defender loses 1 and replaces rest.
 When your race diminishes so that you cant take more/enough regions you skip turn to decline that race and pick another. Declined race turns inactive and has only 1 dude/region but still scores for you. (key point here)

to who:
Those who like region control that do not handle (much) randomness (like El Grande). Game has pretty much replayablitity due base/ability combinations even though map is every time same (depends on number of players)

Powers and races are randomly combined to end up with wacky combinations like "Flying Dwarves" and "Swamp Wizards".  Each player uses their chosen civilization to conquer parts of the world, but competition for land is fierce.  When your civilization has run its course, you can put it In Decline and draw a new one, getting a fresh burst of energy to start conquering again.

LATE TO THE PARTY:  Waited years to play this game and not disappointed.  First game ran very long because we were all first-timers, but I'm sure will go faster next time and am anxious to play again even though I was slaughtered.  It's an area control game, but it's not about taking over the world, a la Risk, it's about getting the most points over a given number of turns. Because each player has unique "special abilities" which may include specific scoring bonuses, the winner isn't necessarily, or even likely, to be the one who controls the most area at the end of the game.  Since each player starts with two unique special abilities which are randomly paired each game and can be changed for other random pairs in the course of the game, it's a statistical certainty that no two games will play the same.  I really like that mechanic.

I originally really liked this game, but as time as gone on i've begun to realise that I just don't find it fun at all. There's just something about the gameplay that leaves me feeling really unsatisfied every time I play it. The mechanic of counting stacked pieces of cardboard always seem to completely strip away any theme that was there to begin with, and if an apparantly thematic game starts to feel abstract to me, then that is a big problem.

Woah!  This game is pretty much everything is was hyped up to be (and I didn't even read the hype until I had played it a few times).  I really like this game and don't see it getting old any time soon, but I'm sure I'll appreciate an expansion by the time they decide to make one.

P.S. This game got old.  Still a goodie, but not as good as the first 20 plays.

A conquest game without much dice-rolling.  But it's a lot better than that makes it sound.  Certainly the key is knowing when to go into decline with your civs.   I eventually warmed up to the whimsical graphics and production. The gameplay is light and quick and the special power combos should give it a lot of replayability.   More fun than I expected.   (note: after several more plays, the appeal of this game is actually increasing for me.   It seems to be getting better with age).   Expansions are excellent and reminiscent of the old Eon expansions for Cosmic Encounter in the way they just give you more races/powers.   Awesome.

RATING: 9
When I hear people say that they don't like the game usually it comes down to the action on the board. Which is a bit of numbers crunching and really isn't that engaging but it plays well. But to be honest the game on the board is only part of the reason why I come to play Small Word. The other half, which gets looked over all too often, are the race and trait pairings which gives a unique game every time. For me the game is picking races that work together, that synergize. Picking the right race at the right time is what drives the game and largely contributes to success, not the actual play on the board. I come to draft races but stay for the light area control.

Many say it's too light and fluffy. I say hardly. It might be marketed as a family game, but it hardly needs to be played that way (although it can be too). 

It is NOT as simple as picking the best race, conquer as many regions as possible, as fast as possible, rinse repeat with another race. Many newbies don't understand the value of abandoning regions, and preserving token count at the cost of a couple points in the short term.

I have owned this game for about 4 or 5 years now, and have not yet been able to get it on the table. This is primarily my own fault, because I never push for it (we're not a huge war-ish game group, so if people are ever up for it I'm more excited to see Kemet or Cyclades on the table.)

I'll be pushing for more of this one in the future - recently went over the rules and reminded myself why I picked it up in the first place! Get a rating up once I've (hopefully) got a couple games under my belt.

RATING: 5.5
This game lasted way too long for what it is, and unfortunately, most of the time was spent consulting the rulebook to figure out the intricacies of the various character races/classes.  Even by the final rounds we were STILL running to that rulebook to figure things out.  And since we only played with a few of the potential class combinations, I’m sure were we to play it again, we would still have the same issue.  The entire game felt like a bunch of players constantly repeating themselves: “What does this mean?...  What does this do?...  Oh, I forgot I could do this, this and this on my turn…”  In most games you learn the rules, and by the second or third round you pretty much have them down and can focus on strategy.  In this game, learning rules IS the game!   

You can’t really plan any long term strategy or even plan in advance of your turn since the board will change by the time your turn comes up.  This just slows the game down more.    

I like games whereby you have a lot of good choices on your turn.  Unfortunately in this game, again and again, players felt they really had very few options on their turn and often only had one.  When it would finally get to the point that there were NO options other than to stay put and just collect money, it was time to put your class into decline and start all over again!  

For some reason this game gets compared to Risk and is often touted as a better version of Risk.  I would play Risk any day over this game.  Risk has streamlined rules that everyone gets by the first turn and can focus on strategy and interact with other players.  Risk is game about diplomacy, Small World seems to be a game about reading rulebooks.

PERSONAL COPY. My favourite area control, maybe in my Top 10 game of all time? It's simple enough for gateway players, just meaty enough (especially with expansions) for core gamers. Not to mention the 2000 possible combination of race and powers! AP can be annoying in this game though, but the fixed number of rounds makes this a nice choice. Map gets boring but that's why we have Realms.  Best with 4 players, but nothing beats a 2p game with an experienced player.

This was the first designer game that I ever played.  It got me hooked on the hobby and I haven't looked back.  i love all of the different races that you can play and the randomized powers give the game tons of replay-ability.  The board is gorgeous and having different sized boards based on the number of players makes it hard to utilize the same strategy over and over again!  This was a 10 for me when I first registered on BGG; however, it's dropped a bit for me in recent years just because of how much it's been played.  I love the iPad version and I own Small World Underground.  I also own the following expansions - Be Not Afraid, Cursed, Grand Dames, and Necromancer Island.

I was both underwhelmed and pleasantly surprised by this game at the same time - two reactions that generally don't go together in my gaming world.  It's very simple but solid and somehow feels a bit lacking, and yet it all holds together remarkably well and has a refreshingly short play time.  This speed and ease of play gives it good re-playability and boosts my rating by 'bout half a point.  The cartoonish art direction is pitch perfect for a game of this weight and length, and makes it all the more endearing.  Works well as light pseudo-wargame for the family.

I bought Smallworld rather late but played a first game on the weekend with my wife and 2 sons (9 & 12). They all loved the game. But something unexpected happened... My 2 sons asked me if they could play the game just the 2 of them. Wow. That had never happened before. Ever. 

And then this. My oldest has a friend over and he asks me if he can show the game to the friend in question. Before long, they are actually playing a 2 player game and even restart it after a while when the friend gets Diplomat and my oldest feels that it should not be used as it is too strong in a 2 player game. 

At that point, I am beyound myself. My plan of making my sons into gamers has worked! It has worked!  On to the last phase where they are going to actually buy a game for themselves with their own money...

I thought this game was ok myself but I will rate it a 9. Why? The kids are playing this by themselves people. Enough said.

It's one of those games that are all cute and great but somehow never end up on the table.
It is in a zone equivalent to a friendzone in a board game world.
But I really love it, it's fun and brutal war game but in a cute way.

good design, but i find it sort of meaningless in a narrative sense. I prefer my conquests to mean more than  victory points this turn. Perhaps there's a philosophical point being made here. You can conquer, but it never lasts.

I gotta say I *really* like this game.  The graphics are spectacular, the mechanics simple and the experience light and fun.

My wife gets annoyed that she can't hold on to a territory (a la Risk) or develop her civilization to her satisfaction.  Just when she starts to like them, they're greyed out!  And that's just the point.  Fast furious action that's over with before it starts. heh

It's a great entry level (kindergarten) game into the world of high end battling and a delightful romp.  If you're looking for something involved that you'll sit at for hours on end battling to the bitter end, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a light experience or just dabbling in the world of war gaming, this is the one for you.  And dang it's fun.  Different every time you play.

Maybe with more maps and a few expansions I'd give this a full 10 stars.  Right now it's probably my #2 game behind Ticket to Ride. (I know, I need to get out more ... but hey, I'm only just starting!) ;oP

Pillaging Wizards ... that's just nonsense! lol ;oD

Nos kicsit féltem az első próbától: anno a Vinci megvolt -ennek az elődje, ami tudtommal gyakorlatilag szinte ugyanez a játék szabályilag- és bár a játékmenet annál is tetszett, de borzasztó lassú, és vontatott volt, úgy éreztem, h 1,5 annyi időt használunk, mint amit megér a játék.
Ezek után végre kipróba Small world: nos a játékmenet még mindig tetszik, és valóban rövidebb a játékidő. Így a legnagyobb hibája az elődjátéknak javítva? Majd persze több próba kell, meg 4-5 fős is. 2 ill. 3-an tökéletes volt a játékidő, az izgalom, a menet.
A táblák, fajok, stb szépek -mondhatni ami a DoW-tól el is várható. A dobozban jó ötlet a külön kis doboz a fajok lapkáinak szortírozott elpakolásához.
Ezek után kíváncsi lett az Underworld-re amiről azt hallottam, h talán még jobb is mint az alapjáték.
Mindenesetre tetszett, elő fog még kerülni

RATING: 9
This game is all about replayability, which is what any great game hopes to achieve.  Each time you play is different because the races and powers are jumbled up and combined into infinite possibilities.  My only wish for future expansions is maybe more boards to play on.  The game says it comes with 4 boards, which is true, BUT each board is for a certain number of players, so it has a 2,3,4 and 5 player board, so if your gaming group is say, 4 people, then you will always be using the same board, which after 10 or so plays starts to get a little predictable.  Future expansions will certainly add more races and powers, so that will make the game even more replayable.

This is my son's game and he likes it a lot more than I do (which is only fair, I suppose). I guess I find the whole mechanic a bit underwhelming. In Risk, spreading your armies too thin has negative consequences for the gameplay. Small World is designed so that spreading armies too thin is required and expected, and whole races of inhabitants are disposable.

Small World is a lot of fun, and doesn't outstay its welcome. Although ostensibly a wargame, it really feels more like an economic engine (i.e. How many turns with this race will maximize my score?).

My gaming group seems to enjoy the meta-game, which largely consists of insisting that the OTHER player is in first place, and should be pummeled.

RATING: 4
Good.  I really like the different race/power combinations, and the balancing mechanic.  That's fun stuff.  And sending races into decline, and the different boards for different numbers of players.  It's a heartbreaker, in a way, because this game is close to being great, but falls short in at least two ways:

The art direction is overly cutesy and trite.  Telling a friend about it, I asked him to guess which two items the dwarf was carrying.  "Battleaxe and a flagon?" was the first thing out of his mouth, and of course he was right.  Gah.  Also, the supersaturated colors, while very pretty in isolation, combine to feel like daggers in the eyes.

The combat system needs to be a little more dynamic, maybe even Risk-esque!  The static element of it is fine, I guess, but feels a little dry for an epic clash of civilizations.  I don't really have a problem with determinism for abstract or economic games, but for games involving war, it really rubs me the wrong way.

I find the board and art too busy but like the way the race and power tokens combos allow for tons of replayability. It usually seems fairly obvious when to decline a race (wait too long once and you won't do it again.) And the board fills up quickly so there's nearly instant combat. Like the separate boards for 2, 3, 4 and 5 players. Perfect for testosterone teenage boys.

RATING: 6
Having played the predecessor of this game, Vinci, I cannot help but compare the two. The change to the theme may have been acceptable, if only to sell more copies (retheme anything into fantasy and people will like it more for some reason).  However, the colorful board and crazy pieces make for an extremely busy board that is hard on the eyes.  Vinci didn't have this problem.  Additionally, the change to make the game a turn-limit instead of a point-limit seems to have only been done for the ADD gamers who can't play a game for more than 2 hours, and ultimately results in a game that seems to be over before it begins.  Furthermore, they added dice! WHY?!...Too make it more frustrating apparently...I don't know what it is, but when you put all the elements together, it results in a sad excuse for a Vinci reprint.  I'm really not sure why this is so much more popular than Vinci.  Most people who have played Small World havn't even heard of Vinci.  Why not?...Probably because it didn't have elves, orcs, and wizards...So sad.

Small World and Ticket to Ride were my first introductions to board games that are not Monopoly, Scrabble, Life, Clue, Sorry, and the like. The art alone drew me in. 

After the first game I felt like there was a whole world I knew nothing about. I was then introduced to some Ameritrash games like Arkham Horror and Last Night on Earth and was even more hooked. 

So honestly I can't separate if this game gets a 10 based on nostalgia or game-play. I know that every game I have ever played I have enjoyed.

not sure it escapes the problems that plague vinci, game is still very dependent on players understanding who is in the lead and it still requires the "beat on the leader" mechanic for the game to be competitive. That said the game is very well produced, if not over produced and i'd be willing to play again, it's just there is a LONG list of games that i would rather play.

RATING: 8
This is a great light weight war/area-control game.  Players choose from different combinations of races and special powers that are randomly paired giving you mostly different combos every game.  When your chosen race is at the end of its usefulness, put it into decline and renew your conquest the next turn with a new race/special power combo.

Very simple base rules, but the racial and special power combos give it a lot of replayability.  The game has different maps for different numbers of players, and it plays quite differently as a 2 player game.  With more players, table talk and negotiations become crucial.  In my experience, a 5 player game does run a bit longer than I'd like and the down time becomes a little more noticeable.  4 players is definitely the sweet spot, but the game scales well with its different sized maps.

The game is easy to play, easy to teach, and the artwork is beautiful.  If you enjoy the game, I recommend getting the expansions that add more crazy races and powers.

Smallworld is a lighthearted war-game in disguise which I enjoy with the right crowd. It's an easy teach and the variable effects of the races and powers make it interesting.  My only criticism is that once all of the tokens are out the board starts to look a bit busy and it gets hard to keep track of all that is going on.

Bought as a replacement for Risk for my gaming group, but not as much fun to run through a game as I'd hoped. Only changing factions once per game is a bit of a downer, I think it would be much more fun if players changed characters 4-5 times per game. Generally fun to play in under an hour.

2016-08-30 : As I have Vinci I was only mildly interested in a fantasy version of it, but when a cheap copy appeared I bought it and put it in the back of the closet to play whenever. Then the iPad version came out and I played it a couple of times, just to see what it was, but the interface just felt wrong to me and I forgot about it. 

Cue our last gamenight where I knew all participants embraced the fighting "take that" spirit that's required to get the most out of this game. I briefly considered going with Vinci, but in a "what the heck, Small World looks better" moment we played it last night and it was a very fun experience, but I could see this game going disastrously awry with the wrong crowd, so it remains a 6.

Really like Small World, especially the variety the expansions bring. It's a bit light on strategy and sometimes it feels a bit scripted (select optimal race/ability combo, play for two turns, decline). But this is a great, light, area control game. The best intro area control game I've played.

This is a light combat/direct interaction game to get people used to before ramping them up to something that has more depth.  I also like that it's a combat game where no one is completely 'down and out' due to being able to choose a new combination of race/power to rejoin the fray.  I love that it is mostly diceless and the dice doesn't have a huge impact on the outcome.  There is great variety in the combinations that show up but I do feel like 6 or more races and a few more powers would have been a better number to start with.  There is debate on the balance of turn order, but I use a blind-bidding auction variant for turn order at the beginning of every turn using your own VP.  My friends and I feel this makes the game far more dynamic in terms of strategy.  One of my complaints is that without the visual aid of colored cubes or another identifier, it may be difficult to see who owns what region, possibly causing people to not score a region or two they control.  My other nitpick is that the 'cheat sheet' for the race and powers sometimes only include one part of an ability that has two specific components (ie the Dragon Master power).

I play this game often with my niece and nephew.  They love to see the different combinations of races and powers.  I like to watch them weigh out their various options and develop a strategy based on these combinations.  It encourages problem solving, critical thinking, and lots of laughter.  I'm proud to say that I've lost to someone 20 years younger than me.  Brilliant.

RATING: 7
Small World's use of the lush board pieces, smooth gameplay, and exciting race/bonus combos helps make it by far better then Vinci. That said, I still find playing the game somewhat flat. For me, the re-taking of map areas each turn is repetitive without too much thought involved, and the rebuying and starting over with a new race is sort of a let down. I guess I prefer aq more typical game of watching your one empire grow and grow until game end.

All that said, it IS still very beautiful and unique to play.

Great beginner game.  The hack and slash style of play is a great lure to new gamers, while the opions provided by the various races make for compelling desion making as well.

I also like the limited turns and the hidden VPs, both control the games length to a managable level.

First of all, Tales & Legends is an absolute must. Don't play or buy without it. The gameplay is too straight forward, as most of the strategy comes from selecting races and selecting when to go into 'Decline', while the rest of the game kind of plays itself out as you observe from the sideline. The two player game is very weak(unless played with 2 races each), and with five players downtime dominates. Better suited for the youngsters (or as the app).

Great area control game that relies on strategy and tactics instead of lucky dice rolls.  The game is a little hard to teach to people new to games but is always great fun.  recommended with 3-4 players as I find the 2 and 5 player counts not very fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Well designed game from Keyarts. Solid components and art as well. The game should work well with a fair number of players, because of the different maps. I thought the game was pretty fun, but a little on the long side for five players. Secret scoring adds a little interest to the game, which I heard that Vinci has traditional scoring. Would like to try Vinci now to get a little contrast. 

Every time I play Small World, I end up disliking it a little more. It's just a little too long, and for how modular the actual game is, it always feels monotonous to me.

RATING: 5
I find the game and its conquering-mechanics a tad to simple, almost banal, as there is no real player interaction and the theme doesn't really kick in.

RATING: 7
This rating is strictly for 2-player.  I have not (and am not terribly interested in) playing it with more.

It's a good game.  It's light and relaxing, but not too light, with a manageable amount of luck and enough depth of strategy to keep it interesting.  Picking the races is interesting, as is the on-board tactics.  There is a balance between the need to score points and the need to kill the opponent's tokens so as to reduce their scoring potential; this balance is in turn influenced by which races are being played or are in store.  

The (rather generic and somewhat silly) fantasy theme is tolerable, and fits the overall feel of the game, although for me it is much less interesting or immersive than the historical armies of History of the World.  In most other ways, though, this is a superior game (the ratings come out equal only because we have houseruled History of the World extensively; for Smallworld there is no need for such tinkering).        

Update 9/6/2012
This has become one of my 5-year old daughter's favorite games.  She particularly likes to play it with 4 players on 2vs2 teams, a variant that works quite well.

RATING: 6.5
This is a very nice light stratagy game that employs tile placment in a fresh approach to teritory control stratagy gameing.  The game has a spoofy, comedic feel to it that goes nicely with the simple play.
My only gripe is that rather then being light stratagy in the sence that everyone likes it, it seems to be too light for most hard core gamers and too heavy for most light gamers.

Superb. Like Risk, but 100% better in every way. Tiles keep things fresh, and the "decline" mechanism is brilliant. Some unbalanced combos but nothing crazy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's short, it's fast and it's simple. Could've been a good game but major flaws bring this down. 

1) Distribution of races and powers not very balanced and it boils down to timing your pick. 

2) Picking who to attack is completely arbitrary. You can't even pick the leader because you don't know who the leader is.

3) Trolls are potentially problematic, compounded by the short game length. Although players are limited to two races (1 active, 1 declined), there isn't much incentive to cycle through the races as the game is so short. So a Troll player can hold on to them declined and still collect a decent sum for them given that attacking them is a pain.

[2 plays] As I've never been able to warm up to Vinci, I suspected this wouldn't be a hit either, and it wasn't.  The fantasy theme added a bit of interest, but also increased fiddliness, and wasn't that thematically coherent since some of the possible combinations are absurd.  The theme is really pretty superficial.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good concept poorly executed. Incredible artwork and an enticing theme, but that's about where the pros end. It is simply a poor design. Each race is either too powerful or too weak, making Small World one of the most unbalanced games I've played. Mechanics are weighted down by exception after exception, very few of which are explained adequately enough in the Rulebook. Not surprising for a game that is essentially built around the idea of breaking itself (each race breaks the game in a different way, some more spectacularly than others). Would be a good entrance-level game if it weren't for the headaches and unwelcome complexity this breaking causes.

The race/power combos make for high replay ability. Great artwork, great component quality. Many, many pieces make for a fiddly game if you tend to be the only one at the table managing all of the set up. I can see this game getting a little deeper when we know the armies better. As of now it's a random slug-fest. Which can be fun, too. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Fun and reasonably fast for what it is. The meat and soul of the game are the special abilities of each race, and the decline mechanism, which both make for a very unique experience. As in all games of its kind, you want to be very persuasive if you don't want to get kicked out of this small world and achieve victory, since victory points are hidden. 
Some races are better than others, first player gets a big advantage, and it doesn't work as well as it should for 2 players though...

RATING: 6
In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.

Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.

Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!

On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go "into decline". A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.

At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depend on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great game for two people upwards of 5 players.  The most we've played with is 4 and it is a very different game than with 2.  You need to alter your strategy since you are unable to play every other turn.  Going into decline at the right moment is key with any more than two players.  The randomness of races and special powers make it very replayable.  We only have the Grand Dames expansion currently but looking to get the others.  Adding races only makes the game better by giving it more options.


Updated comment two years later:  With two players, the game can quickly reduce to put down squares and take coins.  Sometimes there is no incentive to attack the other player.  With more players, the board becomes fuller and expansion into other races is necessary.  A possible twist could be with the addition of Small World Realms to vary the game board between plays.

I really wanted to like this game.  However, my first games were not very successful. My first play was a two player game and I really didn't like it.  I played a three player game later on and the game improved but not too much. I finally played a 4 player game and the game really improved.  I increased my rating from 5.0 to 7.5, and I'm looking forward to play it again.

Not bad because the system it builds on is good.  And I like some of the changes.  Even though I'm not a fantasy guy, I was won over by the new setting, which allows a lot more (mostly well-executed, although not entirely - hate the elves) expansion ideas, and this version of Vinci has an improvement or two over the original (I especially like the big clunky race/attribute pieces).

That said, it's a shame that they simplified the game so much.  My experience was very little tension over deciding when to decline and very little established narrative compared to Vinci.  I was prepared to not like the visual design, but I was unprepared for just how bad it is.  The board seemed to be vibrating with so many colors and shapes, and I literally was getting a headache from looking at it.  Vinci's clean design should have been maintained.

RATING: 7
I really like this game, but I don't get it to the table much. This is a gateway game - area control with a lot more direct interaction between players than Carcassonne. The ameritrash component of rolling the reinforcement die adds a greater range of tactical options and a small element of luck. The points difference at the end of the game can be quite small, sometimes making it difficult to work out who is in the lead. The expansions generally look a bit limited, but I've bought a few to increase the variety of races available.

The only detractor is that the board gets a bit busy and it is not so easy to determine which square is which.

(Rating includes expansion: [thing=57070]Grand Dames of Small World[/thing]. Rating also based on 80+ plays on app)

Can take a game or two to get into because the combinations can seem a bit overwhelming, but after that it plays rather fast. Lots of variety!

Unfortunately, it hasn't been a hit with most of the people I usually game with, so it doesn't hit the table often.

I compare this to a much more light and fun version of risk.  You take on the role of various fantasy races with random abilities that change every game to add a lot of variety and replay-ability.  Use your forces to conquer regions on the map.  Spreading out to cover more territories allows you to score more, but also makes your forces weaker against enemy attacks.  Lots of strategy and variety.  Many tactical decisions to make.

The combos were fun at first and seemed to imply replayability, but the tactical play on the board didn't cut it for me, e.g., I get a bonus for forests, so I want to go after forests. The powers quickly degraded into "want" and "don't want" such that the decisions on what to take were mostly self-evident. Just felt like a gimmick that had run its course.

RATING: 8
Small World is area control at its most simple and finest.  No time is wasted ramping up; it just gets to the good stuff and stays in high gear till the end.  On top of that you have permutations a plenty (280 potential race/power combos out of the box) and if that wasn't enough, you can get more species, more power and more maps!

If people want to play Risk, get them to play this, it doesn't overstay its welcome and it is not a crap shoot.

I am so glad to not have overlooked this absolute gem.

I enjoyed this game on first play, but I sense that over time its rating will fade.  There's not a whole lot of "there" there.  The most interesting bit is choosing your race/power.  After that, the placing of the pieces is a bit blah.

Vinci light (though not THAT much lighter). I wasn't a big fan of Vinci when I played it, though in retrospect I misunderstood the game and played it wrong.

This one makes some rules simplifaction and adds a bunch of chrome. If you like really cartoony fantasy art this is a plus, otherwise you might not like it (Then again, I was never a fan of the original board either). 
A nice mid weight game that plays relatively quickly and is very enjoyable.

I found this game really boring.  Sure, the special powers and mixes of races were neat, and the "decline" mechanic was somewhat novel, and even the art was good - but actually playing the game felt tedious and uninteresting.  I'm surprised how little I liked this:  I was really expecting it to be a lot more fun.

Just grabbed this one.  I've played a few solitaire games and one with my lady friend.  She seemed to like it well enough.  She destroyed me with her Hill Elves.  At one point, I had to focus 2-3 turns on wiping out her declined trolls so that she would have a reason to pick another Race.  Turns 5-8 she was scoring 18 points!  Youch.

I really like the variety provided with the power combos for each game. What I'm not sure if I like or hate is the fact that the game is over in 10 turns and you only get to play with 2 or 3 of those combos. If you get used to the fact that you burn through a race pretty quickly it can be an entertaining game. Just smack things around as much as you can and in a short time you're done.

23/08/2012 - This is quite a fun game. You each pick a humanoid race and try and take over the (small) world by invading different territories. Each territory you occupy at the end of your turn scores you gold which are also the victory points. Each race has unique powers and also has a randomly selected ‘adjective’ to describe them that will that also give them a power. 

Having played the game once, It will hopefully be more straightforward to understand the relative advantages and disadvantages of the humanoids and adjectives.

I am generally not a fan of war games and so was reluctant to try small world when a friend brought it over but I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the game.

Conquering is so simple and yet inevitable that you don't feel picked upon or ganged up on when your races are conquered, especially when they are in decline.

Numbers seem to be a particular consideration and the special abilities a secondary concern but I expect that will shift the more games I play.

I found this game to be fairly dry and boring. The theme, of a bunch of fantasy races squabbling over an overcrowded world, works well enough for the lightness of the core play. This is a light abstract area control game, make no mistake about that.You're not supposed to get too attached to your various civilizations, as they will ousted by newcomers within a relatively short period of time. This feature, works as much against the game as it does for it. That's the problem really, there nothing in here to really keep you coming back again and again. I suspect that most people will find this to be one of those throw away titles that they play a half dozen times and then relegate. I'll play this one if express a desire, but I'd never recommend it myself. 
.
If you strip the theme away entirely, you're left with a fairly solid abstract area control game. If you come to the game looking for some fantasy fun, then you'll find the fantasy theme to be paper thin. Fantasy fans look elsewhere. Abstract fans - give this one a whirl. Pretend it's not about elves, and dwarves, and the like, and you'll probably like this game a lot.

A gift from our 2009 Eastern Iowa Secret Santa (thanks!), this quickly became one of our favorite games. Whether or not you're a fantasy geek, the combinations of racial and special powers (Dragon Master Ratmen? Alchemist Trolls? Wealthy Skeletons?) are always hilarious. I'm always in the mood for this one. Good with 2, great with 3, but truly wonderful with 4-5. Four players may actually be the sweet spot, as 5 does get pretty crowded.

[thing=97786]Underground[/thing] is great too, but if you are only going to buy one it should be the original. [thing=122316]Realms[/thing] should wait until your group is pretty experienced.

The [thing=77097]iPad version[/thing] is awesome. Two-player only, and not all the expansions are included yet, but we love it.

RATING: 8
Fantastic fun game with a great theme that plays out very nicely.

Duration: Other players can calculate a lot and can make turns take ages, but the game isn't too long, you can play your turn quickly (and hustle the others), and the theme takes the edge off.
Design: This is fantastic, with a great mix of theme and mechanics. I enjoy how races in decline still score points, fill up the map, but can't do anything, and how each side has all sorts of weird powers. The underlying mechanics are very simple and straightforward and lean strongly towards action.
Strategy: Strategy is actually pretty simple, leading to a calculation-fest. Powers and race-selection stir things up a bit, and deciding when to go into decline is a major choice. I ease up and play the theme.
Components: Lots of different colourful bits, races and powers lead you to looking lots of things up. Using cardboard icons for developments and terrain makes combat resolution much quicker to work out.
Theme: Massively fun, integrated well.

While it was really fun at first, it has turned into a number counting game, with pretty obvious strategies, which depend solely on the race+ability combo you buy.

This game certainly has its appeal, it is beautifully illustrated and has a warm feeling to it. The numerous different races and special powers add to the game's variety and offer many different combinations to try out. The biggest issue with this game is that the downtime drastically increases with the number of players added. It seems to me that the 2 player variant is ideal for this game, and with every new player comes the growing frustration of waiting for your turn

Juegazo que jugaría muuucho más de lo que me permiten aquí en casa, pero que a menudo cuesta mucho sacar por la pereza de ir leyendo las razas y sus habilidades, y más aún cuando las expansiones añaden nuevas hojas que hacen que todo sea más difícil de encontrar. Aún así, me parece un juegazo como la copa de un pino que se explica en 5 minutos y que me divierte una barbaridad, con las tortas por todas partes. Además, la gente se habitúa tanto a las confrontaciones que no se toma demasiado a pecho que fulanito le arrase. Y los componentes, el diseño gráfico y el inserto son de 10.

I used to rate this better, but after several plays I'm just not sure who this is for. It's too fiddly and has too many rules to work as a gateway game (you have to explain every combo as they come out, and then ask a new player to pick one at the start), but rather light for gamers (and depends too much on the luck of what you pick/who attacks you). It doesn't have much appeal as an area control game because the territory is uniform and never feels very immersive, and there's so much time spent fiddling around with tokens and components.

A strong and not-so-serious theme. Exactly what Vinci needed to shine. Is the game better or worse? I don't know and I don't really care.

I like this easy and fast game. Unfortunately my wife dislikes it... a lot... So, I guess is a game that will not see the playing table for a while.

Az fajok jópofák kellően mások, mint az ug-ben, bár azért vannak átfedések. A relic-ek által generált fyolamatos harcok nekem kicsit hiányoznak a ebből a változatból.

Small World is probably one of the simplest capture and hold games out there. That being said it is still quite fun. The way the races and special powers work change the way the game plays every time. It has 4 different boards to play on based on how many players you want to join in so the game is always fun and always balanced. I think it's best with 4 players. I think the combination of humor, spite, and simplicity make this quite possibly the best game ever? Maybe not but its super fun!

The first things you'll notice if you've played Vinci before are a) lots of fiddly tokens and b) the board that cannot match the clarity of the Vinci board, especially when players start to put all those fiddly tokens on it.

In play, however, two different points stand out more: The combinations of race abilities seem to be more balanced, even more so by the fact that repeatedly overlooked combinations are made more and more attractive, and the board is much tighter, helped by the fact that you can now let your new races settle right next to or even in your former territories.

I was a bit sceptical due to all the hype when Small World was published but after having played I must admit it really improves the original design.

This is a pretty solid area control game. Most of my plays have been 2 player, I'm not sure it's really best with 2.

I like this game but I never really feel like I WANT to play it.

Excellent game...almost a 10.  Clear, well written rules, great game components and a plastic box insert that actually does it's job.

  Smallworld is simple enough for even the very young to play and have fun.  A great game involves even the losing players to have a lot of fun and this Smallworld does in spades.

  A lot of the skill in this game involves diplomacy but not as much as Settlers of Catan.

Conquer the world with your tribe of rats, humans, wizards or other miraculous beeings and let them "die" next round to make place for your successing superpower with new abilities and specialties. All this to collect the most treasure coins and beeing the winner after 10 Rounds/Decades.
Beeing fast to play, easy to teach and having endless variety are making this game supe fun and my all time favourite.
(If you never played it, get it now and start falling in love with it by playing it with your family.)

Simple, fun, and fast. Great for a party game, and a good introduction for non-gamers. Artwork is great, and the game ends at just the right time. I appreciate that after 1-2 rounds everyone is forced to start fighting. It takes the edge off and makes it okay for more timid players to get in on the action.

RATING: 8
So, Small World plays just like Vinci, more or less.  On the off-chance you don't know what Vinci plays like, it's a game of rival civilizations, each with two randomly selected powers, all of whom vie over territory until they've spread out as effectively as they can, at which point each civilization goes into decline and another one starts right back up the next turn.  Small World adds a fantasy theme and a lot of nice graphical style, plus some other tweaks here and there.  I think I prefer Vinci in some ways - I like the simpler design style and there are less fiddly bits to deal with - but those are minor quibbles.  Also, Small World has expansions coming out soon, and if there's anything a board game fan likes, it's expansions.

Long wait time between turns. Game finishes after what feels like an arbitrary # of turns. The combinations of race/power are rarely interesting. Need to constantly check the rules sheet.

So when I first saw this game in stores, I thought it would be AWESOME. Then I read some cautionary tales about how this game doesn't play as well as it might seem, and I decided to make this my flagship for games not to be judged by their cover. Fast forward a year later and I am finally playing this game. Turns out I was being dumb. This game is a heckuva lot of fun. The strategies aren't terribly brain burning, but there is plenty to think about. Battle is simple, and doesn't feel overly antagonizing to other players.

2nd copy of game. Received 4/29/09 from Boards & Bits.  I love this game!

Have now played but 4 games (one 2-player; one 3-player; two 4-player games. Loved it each time. 

The shine is still on it as it's just a week old, so the rating will wait. But currently it is a winner in my gaming group. Six played it this week (two 3-player games, all newbies but me) and everyone gave it a thumbs up.

Am torn between rating it a 9 and an 8 - thus, the 8.5 rating.

RATING: 8
Small World is definitely a fun game.  I love the quirky Races that are created and the relative ease of play. There is some continued look-up stuff happening with all the special powers that are involved, but it is usually easy to follow and understand.  Enough luck comes out from the Races that appear and how that reinforcement die rolls, but overall the rest is under the player's control. Sometimes the decisions that need to be made are fairly obvious, but that doesn't necessarily take away from one's enjoyment of the game. It's quite a likeable, tactical, back-and-forth sort of game that seems fairly well balanced.

Yay! Here's a game that's not Scrabble or Boggle that my wife likes to play. Actually, my whole family likes to play it. The theme is whimsical and the artwork is nice to looks at. The Race/Power combos can make things really interesting. This is like Risk, but with a fantasy theme, more variety in play styles, less dice-rolling, and a shorter end game.

RATING: 6
Much more streamlined than Vinci - they've done a good job. This is one case though where I don't go for the fantasy theme so much, as I love the idea in Vinci that this is the Vandals attacking the Visigoths as the Huns pressure them from the other side. Much quicker, solved the end-game problem, very pretty.

The round generic fantasy art is cutesy, if you like that.  The player character races have unique powers that are enhanced by their type.  This mechanic is VERY cool and more games should use it.

RATING: 6
This is a fun game.  Quick playing and a lot of variety in race/power combos make Small World shine.  The rules are straightforward, everything is stripped down, except for game play and it really offers solid gaming in a short period of time.  Feels light, but has real decisions.  Experimenting with combos adds interest to each game, judging when to bow out is always taxing.  This is a great game, with great production.  Can easily see my rating going up, and it becoming an all time favorite.  Love it after two plays.

A very well-rounded area control game that plays quickly and is easy to teach but rewards strategic play. The light fantasy theme works well, and the colorful artwork is easy on the eyes.

I prefer this game with more than two players so it doesn't get out as much as I would like.

I'd stick to the base game - it is good as it is with lots of variation in the race / abilities combos. That's what I like best with this game - that each game is different due to randomly combining the races with the different abilities.

Another game that gets repetitive after many plays. We finally got rid of this as we rarely play with more than two players and when we do have friends over there are other games we would prefer to play

After one play I'd call Small World a good game that I wouldn't mind playing again - maybe one or two more times.

Surprisingly however, I anticipate that it would start to feel repetative rather quickly.  

Yes, there are a score or more races and special abilities that can all be differently paired to make a very large number of different possible combinations of pieces to play.  However, the vairability just isn't enough for my tastes, In actual play they each still feels very much the same.  In my one play (with 3 players) each of us played 3 race/special abililty combinations.

For lovers of Vinci (the game for which this is a remake) I suspect that this will be an improvement - more races, better components and different maps for smaller and larger numbers of players.

Fiddly is the first word that comes to my head when thinking about this game. It's not bad, gameplay is rather fast and smooth, however the hidden victory points and number of chits that show up on the board seem to make this game much more time-consuming than it otherwise needs to be. I've also got a copy on PC through Steam and games are much more enjoyable there as there is no setup or teardown time, allowing me to fire up a game and be done within about half an hour.

RATING: 1
The artwork is great, and the race combinations mechanic is a neat idea; however, this game suffers from two big problems:

1) Too many little pieces! I hate games like this which take forever to setup and put away, and the board can be a visual mess when it has pieces on it. It's cluttered and gross.

2) It just plain isn't fun to play. It's basically Risk with complications that don't add any fun. One other reviewer likened it to doing many small math problems, and that's spot-on.

It's nothing against Days of Wonder - I enjoy the Ticket to Ride games. Just not not this one.

I guess this is Days of Wonder's take on wargaming.  This is a fairly lightweight combat-centric game in which points are awarded for the number of regions a player controls at the end of his turn.  Each player controls one race at a time, but can choose to allow a race to "go into decline" (hold territory, but not attack) while launching an offensive with a new race.  So the player has to make some interesting decisions about which races to choose and when to send them into decline.

Not really my thing, but I could be convinced to play this from time to time.

After a five player and most of a two player, it is apparent how important is the selection of races and their special powers.  Simplicity = elegance in this game.

RATING: 6.5
I really hate to give this game such a low rating, but I would of rated this game an 8 if not for the chaotic layout and looks of the board and chits. I think the gameboard is to vibrant in color and the chits are too dull and hard to distinguish between the different tribes when the gameboard gets full. I really believe that if the gameboard was of a duller not so vibrant color and the chits where brighter in more variable colors it would be alot easier to distinguish all the different races and make the game a lot easier to play. It gave me a headache just looking at this thing trying to find all my tribes. All in all it was a fun game that was just to difficult to find everything on the board. Especially with 4 players.

Grand Total - 22.5/25

A whimsical yet substantial area control game with diceless combat and cutesy graphics that potentially detract from its elegant, well designed heart. A game in which due to surpreme variability of Races and Powers consistently asks player to develop strategies on the fly and around the gaming table as opposed to turning up with a shrewd, pre-baked plan in mind. Those pre-baked strategies can still work but only if you succeed to adapt it to the ever changing, vibrant game state. For myself Small World represents the accessibility to depth golden ratio of board game design.

The game so painfully simple and yet gives a lot of tactical opportunities and tough choices. The lightest of all war games one can say and it's actually very true. There isn't any depth nor strategy to it but the gameplay flows smoothly and is simply fun.

Fun strategy/conquest game that is simple to pick up and teach (although going thru the special abilities/powers takes a bit of time when selecting a race).  Well balanced for any number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only played a couple of games of this so far, but loving it. Love the way conquest involves no (well, only a tiny amount of) luck. Love the variety in races/powers. Love the way you're never stuck - if you're in a bad spot, just put your race in decline and start again with a new one! Just awesome.

Only drawback is that the rules leave a few ambiguities that need resolving.

RATING: 3
Boring. Plodding. Obvious choices. Lacks both subtlety and charm. Regions on board hard to discern. Ridiculous Disneyland style graphic design. With a die roll cherry on top. No more. Back to Vinci for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Basically Vinci with a fantasy theme.  Good game, and has been streamlined a little for smoother play, but the board is so busy and the counters are difficult to distinguish from each other.  A case of too much graphic detailing detracting from ease of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game, looks good and fun for the family and non-gamer friends. Rules are very easy to learn and games are quick so you can play often. Components are very colourful - which can also be a negative as the many colourful tokens can become lost on the likewise colourful board.

RATING: 8
A fantastic war-game, and one of the few war-games that I prefer with more than two people. There's a lot of luck surrounding the race and power combinations, but the rest of the game has little luck. Get a few expansions to add some more variety. Among non-gamers, the game works surprisingly well, if you can just convince them to play. Among gamers, prepare to enjoy lots of nerdy roleplaying as players act out their race selections.

RATING: 6
Game is just light enough to teach the willing, but not deep enough to give satisfying choices and comes down to "beat the guy who's likely winning the most".

RATING: 8
It's more or less Vinci. I know people want to choose sides when it comes to the Small World / Vinci debate. The changes are minor and really if you want to play with open scoring you can in Small World. One thing I like about Small World are the added races and abilities that the expansions provide, since the most interesting and fun part of the game for me is choosing my next civ and deciding when to kill off my current civ.

Genius concept. A clever way to reenvision the original premise - using fantasy races removes the onus of pointing to human history.
Great game to use as next stop after Catan and TtR. The only problem is that new players might have some trouble keeping track of all the different abilities if they're not used to reading that much.

It's good fun! A very light area control game with a goofy theme. There's enough strategy to keep heavier gamers engaged but it's simple enough that anyone can do alright.

A simple game with a lot of replayability. My problem is that it's very easy to target certain players and basically remove their possibility of winning without any cost for yourself. Ideally that prevents a runaway leader and keeps things interesting, but when playing with new players (which is common since it's a good gateway game) that can't identify who's currently winning, it can just be frustrating.

The game is ok for what it is, but there is not much of a game there. I wish there was a bit more to troop movement. The artwork makes the pieces blend in a bit too well, making the game pieces harder to discern from the background. The ability to switch races is a nifty one. I'd play it every now and then for quick filler, but it doesn't hold interest for long.

Almost the whole game screams FUN.
Artwork of the box - FUN, race artwork and names - FUN, combination of races and properties - FUN.

You will be forced to interact with the other(s) during the game because the world is small and everyone wants the biggest chunk out of it.

One of the best things about this game is optimization. You have 2 double side maps. One for 2/3 players one for 4/5 players. The race tokens have their special place inside, each race with its own place. Every other token has its own place, so when you want to put the game back in the box it's easy and fast and you won't spend a lot of time sorting token when you want to play next.

I have already played it a couple of times and will do it more, even if just for the laughs if not for winning as well.

Also I'm eager to play with the expansions.

It was Days of Wonder's new shiny.
I couldn't resist.

After playing this one, it fell rather flat for us.

The theme could have been anything, and felt kind of tacked on, as the fantasy flavour for this particular game just didn't do it for me. The light-hearted fantasy seemed to light for me, but just about any theme could have been stuck on this thing. The fantasy theme was a marketing gimmick, and I'm sure the non-themed Vinci worked just as good, probably better.

Don't even get me started on the army token container when those suckers fall over. What a pain, but I'm sure it's been elaborated on enough.

Maybe I expected more? But it almost seemed overly simple, and the fact that you never stuck with anything for any length of time really felt like an ADD gamers dream. I felt like I could never stick with my civilization long enough before I had to shift gears, put it in decline, and start another. I'm not sure why, but this just didn't sit well with me.

Likely non-gamers will like this one due to the simplicity of the rules, and funny art.

I grabbed the iOS version and have been playing it quite frequently. It seems I enjoyed this more than I first thought.
My initial impressions also seem to be founded on the fact that I totally suck at this game.

RATING: 8
Big fun, quick play, and surprisingly strategic. My favorite feature is that a unique map for each player count 2-5 makes the game equally well-balanced for any number of players. Be aware that it fully exhibits the usual area-control catch-up mechanism of players ganging up on the leader--the ability to appear unthreatening while scoring big points is an important skill! The mini-expansions add a lot to the game as well.

In Small World you’ll fight for control of a fantasy island that is just too small for everyone, but contrary to most civilization type games, you won’t lead your race to victory, various races will lead you to it.

Games usually last between 45 to 90 minutes and in that time players will cycle through 2 or 3 races.

You start with a race that has a special power attached to it (more on that later), enter the map through one of the border regions of the board, conquer some territories and at the end of the turn score 1 point for each territory. Eventually you’ll stretch out your race so much that you’ll have to put it into decline, you will still get points from the territories that race occupies but will have a chance to enter the board with a new race.

This ends up being one of the most important decisions in the game, knowing when to quit.

Traded 7 Wonders for this and I'm glad I did. This is a much better 2p experience. Just as fast with more of a board game feel.  I guess I'm not a huge fan of the card game format in 7 Wonders.  This one's a nice, lightweight keeper, similar in weight to Ticket to Ride: Europe for my collection.  The variable racial and special abilities make for interesting strategies.

Update: just played 4p and it's better than 2p.  Glad I traded for this, but I'm still not sure it's pulling me in.

UPDATE: eh, I don't think this is deep enough for us and we don't feel tied to our characters / races.  It feels too random and chaotic and we haven't been engaged.  Traded it away.

Small World is an extremely [i]fun[/i] game to play, whereas its predecessor Vinci felt kind of bland and generic and clinical.  Vinci was a marginal game in my collection - one that I owned, then traded away, then traded for another copy, then traded away again.  Small World is a core game in my collection, and won't suffer the same fate.  Although I will say that the repeated rise and fall of Vinci is much more thematic than the permanent place Small World has claimed!

There are a host of refinements and good design decisions that elevate Small World far above its predecessor. More evocative artwork and game materials.  More interesting and more varied traits for the empires.  Separation of the traits into races and special abilities.  A defined number of game turns.  Hidden victory points.  Different game boards for each number of players.  Less stereotyped board positions due to elimination of attack-from-mountain bonus.  Addition of reinforcement die for more drama.  Elimination of empire cohesion and declining empire adjacency rules.

In terms of rules, Small World is more streamlined than Vinci.  But the gameplay is not "dumbed down" at all.  I'd argue the opposite - that the Small World gameplay is amplified over Vinci.  I find the newer game to be more interesting, more variable, and more tightly focused around the strengths of the system: choosing your empire, sprawling across the board as quickly as possible, smashing the other empires, and timing when to send your empire into decline and start the cycle again.

Highly enjoyable competitive game. It has already been said before, but Small World is a streamlined version of Risk.

This is a great game to play with my wife on iPad. We were playing a lot of Ticket to Ride, but really enjoy the additional strategy that the game gives. I do wish the game was a little easier to grok when you first start playing. The biggest trick to learning it is knowing how to count troops needed to take over. A friend best described it as "count the pieces of cardboard" Meaning you count the number of layers of cardboard above the table: The board +1, the opponents stack of 2 guys +2, the mountain they are on +1, the bivovak protecting them +1 = 5, so I need 6 to take it over.   Once you get that down the game flow really kicks into high gear.

RATING: 7
I can't help but criticize this game from a competitor's standpoint. Winning Small World has so much to do with what the other players choose to do (or not do) that it often feels out of your hands. Some people love the game for this reason. I tolerate this aspect of Small World. I have to say that this is definitely emphasized if playing with inexperienced players. With experienced SW players, not as big a problem.

What I definitely enjoy is the number of options you have on your turn. You are in total control of how productive your turn is given your current position on the board. And, most importantly, for the time being, I find the game extremely fun.

7-24-2011:
Coming to the conclusion that I like this game best with 2-3 people. 2 is the best way to guarantee that the game is about strategy/tactics. The increased interaction in a 3 player game still makes it slightly better. But one player can still easily ruin the experience by creating a runaway winner. I've finally decided that in a 4/5 player game I spend half my time annoyed by the decisions others are making - attacking a weaker player and letting the leader run rampant. People just don't seem to get that you MUST attack people in the lead in order to compete in this game, even if it means scoring fewer points yourself. In a 4/5 player game, no one wants to be that person who has to attack a well fortified race. Things might change with 4-5 experienced gamers, but when do I ever play a light game like SW with 4-5 experienced gamers?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Small World hit like a bomb as I didn’t thought I would like it. It just looked a little simplistic and too war gamey. Well, I can say that I am impressed. My best word to put on it is elegant and it works. I also think this has a considerable replayability, even if I would have wanted to have more races and abilities in the game.

I have only played with 4 and 5 players, but I think this will scale well. With more players there are fewer turns.

This is a fun game, no doubt. I like the mechanic of flipping an active race into demise and starting a new race. I like the random combos that are different every game. A very good gateway game.

RATING: 6.5
Each player choose a combination of race/power and try to expand as much as he can.  Soon or later you won't be able to expand anymore so you will have to decline and come back stronger with a new race/power.  Some combination are too powerful.  There's too much downtime in this game if playing with 4 or 5 player.

Love it, massive replay value and a lot lighter than Risk etc.
Only negative is that you can really play like a dick if you want, pummelling weaker opponents to the point where it's just not that fun for them. This happens more often in two player games, so sometimes restraint makes for better more challenging games.

Vinci on steroids, but manages to cut down all of Vinci's shortcomings. 

*** UPDATE ***
I NEVER manage to win at this game!
Nevertheless it is a very good game, and I recommend it to everyone. 

*** UPDATE ***
I don't enjoy this game very much now. Even if I win, I do not get satisfaction and it is very strange as I can say it is a very well thought and designed game. 

*** UPDATE ***
The problem with this game is theme - I hate the humor fantasy theme, I'd preferred a more serious one as this is a game ultimately about genocide... - AND there is a problem with leader o player bashing: you win in this game if you're not attacked by anyone, so perceptions at the game table are paramount: if you look dangerous, because it is YOU, that wins OTHER games, then you DON'T STAND A CHANCE. Welcome to Small World. Nevertheless, with a group of more expert gamers things could be a little different, still... 
I have to lower my rating to "6".

My favourite area control game. It's medium weight and has a fun, cartoonish fantasy theme to it. What I love most about Small World is the ability to decline and pick an entire new race + power. This mechanic means you are never out of the game, you can always keep playing unlike some other area control games. 

Other great things about this game are the different maps that scale according to the number of players. And also the insert, which works really well, especially the token holder.

The one downside for me is that it doesn't really work all that well as a 2 player game. But overall I'm really happy with this game. One of the first games that I've purchased and still one of my favourites.

Lovely looking game, lovely box layout, very clear rules.
But where is the "hilarious" game that is promised?
Average gameplay at best, it totally left us cold. For me the whole putting your current race into decline means that I never get a chance to "bond" with the race I'm playing and thus, have no desire to preserve them or attempt to make their rivals suffer. I considered buying expansions in the hope of turning it into a fun game but have decided not to take that risk, instead I will be buying different games that will hopefully be more engaging.

Annak ellenére, hogy még mindig nem vagyok benne épp eredményes játékos, az egyik nagy kedvenc. A vizuális köret tetszetős, de a játékmenet fogott meg igazán. Az, hogy nincs minden játszmára alkalmazható konkrét stratégia. Elképzeléseink egyik pillanatról a másikra dőlhetnek meg, így mindig egy adott helyzetre próbálunk helyesen reagálni. Ez köszönhető egyrészt a kombinálható fajoknak és képességeknek, amik hol erős, hol kevésbé kiemelkedő kombinációkat adhatnak. De mit sem érnek irányításunk alatt a jobb kombinációk, ha azt nem a körülményekhez mérten használjuk ki. Így az is előfordulhat, hogy egy más esetben erős népséget egy kör alatt eltékozlunk és különlegességeit nem tudjuk kamatoztatni. Ezek mellett, mint területfoglaló játék az tetszik a Small world-ben, hogy valójában győzelmi pontokért megy a küzdelem. Ezért nem minden esetben vagyunk rákényszerülve, hogy tartsuk a térkép egy részét, ha a fajunk erre nincs rákényszerülve (pl. plusz pontot kap bizonyos terület típus birtoklásáért). Egy apró dolog viszont zavar benne: az eredményes játék nem feltétlenül a tapasztalaton múlik, vagy, hogy mennyire gondoljuk át mit csinálunk. Passzív játékkal is messzire lehet jutni. Volt hogy egy figyelmetlen játékos döntése nem magára vagy épp az első helyre esélyes játékosra volt kellemetlen hatással, hanem pont arra aki vissza tudta volna fogni az utóbbit.

This is an excellent area control game with a fun theme and interesting mechanics.  There are some factions that will come out available for use that will be more powerful than others (cough, seafaring sorcerers), but this is mitigated by a victory point cost, lower number of troops, and the fact that other players will beat up on you a little more, though not nearly to the same extent as Cosmic Encounter.  Actually, I'd say that Smallworld has everything I like about Cosmic Encounter, and none of the countless things I hate about that game.  (Admittedly, the two games are rather different in playstyle.)

Great game.  You have to play a lot to understand quickly what each option is.  Otherwise, it slows the game quite a bit to figure out what each combination does and which choice is best.

RATING: 7
Like many other people, I really loved this game the first dozen times I played and the first couple of expansions rekindled a waning interest as it was tiring.  Since then my love for the game has lessened, but I'll still happily play it.  I'm not sure what this game is lacking, actually. It has great components, solid mechanics that make an area control game feel balanced, and the replay value is heightened by the hundreds (thousands?) of race and power combos that are randomly set in every game.  The only thing I can think of, is that the game is too light for my tastes and lacks the depth of some of my preferred games.
---
Having just revisited this one, in a 2 player format "balance" is not the word I'd choose.  The IMbalance of some of the race power combos allows one player to absolutely trounce another, without a 3rd, 4th, or 5th player to try to break the leader down.  Still fast, fun, and furious with the right group though.

I went from being excited about the art and description, to disappointed by the actual mechanics, to enchanted by the flow and variety in this game. It sits in an odd place in terms of play length as it is a little too long to be a good appetizer or desert, and a little too short and light to be the main course of an earnest game night. I want to give it an eight, but honestly, none of my plays of this game have been particularly memorable. I find myself being won over by the game each time I play, as opposed to it building up any capitol. A quirky little war game, for a casual diversion.

I've enjoyed playing this a couple of times.  But it seems some groups are much more powerful than others, with some being downright useless.  I don't know how much is not playing the game much, but when one guy started with the trolls and jumped into the mountains and was entrenched there for the game, it looked like a meta-heavy type game.  Fun to play, though, and I will play again.  Just disappointed that the races/abilities aren't more balanced.

The game is beautiful and the races/powers are very clever.  Gameplay is pretty boring though.  Interaction is limited to "I hope I have enough cardboard on my space so no person messes with me."  

Maybe the expansions help.  I don't want to spend my money to find out.

What else to say about Small world.

Massive replay value, so many different race and attribute combinations to play. Simple mechanic keeps, one core rule, with multiple exceptions to the rule (based on race/attribute), keeps the game moving without getting bogged down.

Cute art, great for 2 players, better with more to prevent fights.

VArious expansions add new experiences.

Cons: Can be a little simple, many many pieces, some combinations really lack some punch...

Love it play regularly.

Nearly a decade ago, defunct publisher Euro Games released Vinci, a fabulous game of conquest and the rise and fall of civilizations.  Designed by Frenchman Philippe Keyaerts, the game included several clever innovations, and proved quite popular in gaming circles.  While there were complaints of ambiguous rules, public victory points, and its duration, it was -- and still is -- considered by many to be a wonderful example of a "Civilization-light" design.

Keyaerts' creation was so original and memorable, that it just couldn't be left alone.  Days of Wonder has released Small World, a revised and re-themed version of the game which has satisfied much of the critics' complaints, including significantly reducing the time required to play.  The new version is now set in a fantasy world literally overflowing with a wide variety of different races, including dwarves, elves, trolls, giants, sorcerers, tritons and more.  The small world in which they live and seek to expand is simply too small to allow all of them to survive and live comfortably, so the only result is conflict in a Darwinian "survival of the fittest" mode.

Small World maintains nearly all the flavor and features of the original, and is easier to teach and understand, and plays faster.  I do prefer the realistic feel of the original as opposed to the fantasy setting of Small World, but overall, I must admit that I now prefer the new version.

Very simple conquest game that comes down mainly to picking up the best combinations of race and special powers, for the right cost and at the right time. Some tactical positioning and choosing who to attack, but there isn't really much more to it, not to mention a big potential for kingmaking. I'm not fond of the artwork and would have preferred a more serious approach of the Fantasy theme. I miss plastic miniatures, which are present in most big-box games of the same publisher and would have been really great here. I even think they did a lazy job in choosing the races (wizards and sorcerers?!). Nonetheless, there is something addictive to the game, and although I don't know if that will last much longer, I have enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.

Wow, that got old *fast*.

For a game with a thousand tiny pieces I would expect some goddamn depth, but no. Small world has the simplicity (and tedium) of checkers with the fiddliness of... I don't know something more fiddly than any other game I fucking own. Want leaderbashing and kingmaking in a game? Small World has you covered, since bashing the leader is basically all you do. Want downtime? I mean [i]lots[/i] of downtime? Small World is your game! Not only do you have fuck-all to do during other people's turns, but every third turn or so, you'll go into decline and your turn will end immediately!

The whole decline mechanic is lame in my mind; your civilization isn't going to stick around anyway, so it's really hard to care about building your civilization. And thematically what the fuck is going on here? Are you the king of a tribe? Then why does your reign span multiple civilizations? Are you some kind of god that's creating these civilizations or something? Then why do you care about money? It's just confusing. I have never experienced a game wear out its welcome as fast as Small World did.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I might have been a bit generous with this.  It just doesn't seem to reward expansion over multiple turns enough.  So, it's come on, expand, decline, next.  Just seemed somewhat blah and repetitive.  Wish there was a way to incentivize someone into keeping and expanded a given civilization.

I like my light civ building/area control games to have some progression to them and not a repeat of the same thing over and over.  Yeah, there are a couple combos that give incentives to stay on the board.  BUT, like you said a couple out of say 12-16 in a game, that's not a significant percentage.

My first real boardgame and the one that got me into the hobby. It's a area/conquor game with a fantasy theme. the great thing about it is how each game can be different because of the difference combinaison of races and powers that are drawn randomly each game, making each game somewhat unique. It's fast, easy to learn and a great gateway game.

A nice and light, yet confrontational game. The mechanics are a bit clumsy and non-intuitive but they do the job. 

I suppose it can be a good gateway game, but we shelved it after only a few plays as it just feels a bit too shallow and repetitive. It's also extremely unbalanced, with some insanely OP combos and quite a few "meh" ones. 

I personally don't care for the ultra cutesy art & theme and found that it distracted me from the actual gameplay. 

Ultimately this is not a game that will see any table time so I sold it.

Somewhat successful re-implementation of Vinci. Paradoxically, it both seems too chaotic and too deterministic at the same time, with tactics taking a back seat *and* the actual conquest/combat part coming off as a bit tame.

Having played Vinci for ages, I don't see any reason to change to this watered down version. It may still be a good game, but since Vinci has been there for so long, this one is just not needed.

I dislike some of the changes, aswell as the new layout. It just looks like a kids game. Don't get me wrong, the art isn't bad, but again, Vinci didn't need such a new version. Would it have been used for a completely different game, it would be fine, but not for Vinci.

RATING: 8
The random joining of the powers and races makes replay completely varied.  In fact, I didn't really need the expansions, but I bought them out of love and loyalty and they are pretty fun, too.  Plus, this is yet another game where you can think for literally half the game that you have no chance to win, and then you make a few decisions (go into decline, pay to get this certain race/power combo) and at the end when you count your coins -- SURPRISE, you kicked butt.

It is basically a Euro masquerading as a light wargame. There is no dice rolling, there are no chokepoints, front lines hardly matter. And yet the designers managed to make special powers be extremely significant, and the game to feel like a wargame in the sense that you are taking territory away from your opponents and foiling their schemes. Once you get a resource (a coin), it is yours to keep. That means that you can go tactical sometimes and beat people who are being strategic; i.e., you can make some very large but very temporary gains, reap those coins, and then lose the territories back in the next few turns, but you remain competitive because you banked so much on your big push. That dynamic allows the designer (and the gaming community, which contributes the ideas for the expansions) to come up with some powers that are short-term and some powers that are long-term, which again leads to an extremely varied game.

And the game is quick to play!

The only negative: the stupid token tray with square sides, that invariably drive you crazy trying to get the tokens out.  They changed the tray in an expansion, but you have to deal with the original one regardless.

This is a really good game, but one thing bugs me about it and stops me loving Small World. When you play a game tactically for an hour or more, surely the best player should win? Surely someone who just decided to mess about, or just doesn't play with much thought, shouldn't decide who wins the game? And I'm not being bitter - I'm not great at it - it just seems too long for a game so dependent on other players being sensible/competent.

Les différentes caractéristiques et les pouvoirs spéciaux des différentes races de créatures peuvent amener une certaine confusion toutefois.

Excellent game. It's a wargame, but the people who normally don't like wargames do not feel like it is. Maybe it doesn't feel as bad to lose hard earned ground, when you are being attacked by Flying Giants or Trading Skeletons. And you get the sweet feeling of slapping their extended 'hinds back after you ditch your old race and pick up a brand new fighting machine! Game is just long enough for maximum satisfaction without dragging too long.

RATING: 9
I'm really digging this one. I love the different combinations of powers and how much they change each game. It's a conflict game without feelings of betrayal and ganging up. It has a great mechanical structure to it. I think some people don't like it because they feel there aren't a ton of choices to make when it comes to actually moving your dudes around the map (and that's at least partially true), but the real game is about deciding WHOM to attack, when to take your civilization into decline (you get a turn of very few points, but you get a new strong civilization next turn), and most importantly, which civilization you want to use. You have 5 choices of race/power combinations but they each cost different amounts of gold. Having the most gold is how you win the game, so taking anything except the first civilization in the queue is going to mean sacrificing points now with the hope of getting more points later. There are tons of great decisions packed into a short playing time, and the cartoony theme really makes this fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very similar, but much much better than Vinci.  Improvements include:
- fixed number of turns (8-10, depending on number of players), not a fixed score to reach
- attack costs are easier to calculate (because of no bonuses for attacking from mountains, etc.
- no requirement for empires to be contiguous at end of turn
- only certain combinations of abilities are allowed, because race and special ability tiles are in separate draw piles
- different maps for different numbers of players
- hidden points -- well, debatable whether this is a good thing, but it does reduce the "hammer the leader on the last turn" problem of Vinci

There are still some difficult decisions in this game, and sometimes you're stuck in a difficult place with no way to win, which isn't fun.  But at least the game is over mercifully quick (under an hour?), and you can move onto another game!

Difficult decisions:
- Who should I attack this turn?
- Should I spread my attacks around evenly, or try to crush one opponent's old empire to force them to go into decline?
- How can I make it attractive for an opponent to go into decline?
- Is it worth it for me to go into decline, given that my current empire has so few tokens on the board that I'll get only 3-4 points when other players are getting 10-15 points?
- Should I go into decline now when another player is just about going into decline *after* me?  Going into decline first gives me first pick of new race, but going into decline second allows me to attack with a pile of new tokens and stay away from the new empire.
- Is it worth it for me to go into decline with only 2-3 turns left?  (Obviously pointless if this is the last turn.)
- Which empire should I choose, given what empires are on the board already, and what new empires other players are likely to choose next?

Other notes:
- beware the Flying Sorcerers!  They can pop up anywhere on the board.

Love this game. It's cool that you can cycle quickly through different races so that even though the game mechanics are really repetitive, it never gets old.

Great for beginners. It might take a few turns to really get a hang of it, but because the same actions are performed every turn (with slight variations) it's not too difficult to pick up. Great bridge between beginner games and more complicated games since it has race and class abilities.

The iPad app has made it so I very rarely break out the physical game.

With the right crowd, nice stories unfold (ie fantasy geeks).  The purely game aspects feel lighter than Vinci, allowing to draw a more familial public in the game.

Small World is one of those games that you want to keep playing to find out what all the characters and special abilities do. The gameplay itself is very easy to comprehend but all the readingthat takes place during the game may be a turn off for some, especially if its their first go at it. Aside from all the literature, the game is very easy and it takes lots of brain power to keep a good strategy going! ...oh- and the artwork is incredibly well done!

Smallworld has really dropped on my play list.  After many plays of the game it really feels like players are just going through the motions every turn.  Engaging in combat with other players is really almost always a losing proposition and is neither fun for the agressor or the target.  Add on top of this clearly broken combinations such as Merchant Elves and the game loses ground quickly.  It is best as an introductory game for newer board gamers that may have only ever heard of Risk.

This purchase was a little bit of a disappointment.  Not that it is a bad game – it just did not live up to its #7 rating for family games.  In fairness, my 12 year old son absolutely loved it at first, and my wife and I thought it was so-so to fairly fun at the beginning.  After about 5 plays, I would say my son’s rating came down to “liking” it (instead of loving it), while the opinion of my wife and I remained the same.

Essentially, it is a fancy (and more light hearted) version of Risk.  There are certainly some differences – don’t get me wrong – but it definitely has very similar concepts.  So, if you enjoy Risk, you will probably enjoy Small World.  That said, I do like Small World better than Risk.

The bottom line, though, is that this game rarely sees the table any more for this family.

Fun, thematic, creative area control game which offers countless possibilities with the combinations of races and super powers. Rating could potentially go either way as i get to play this more.

Update. Never bothered to play this more for one reason or another. Can't put my finger on it as to why, but, adjusting the rating accordingly.

RATING: 7
I really love the theme of this game, and it is very accessible. I also really enjoy the fact that you get so man combinations of powers and races (especially with all the race/power expansions).

The key to victory seems however to be common for these games and somewhat uninteresting- hope you get attacked the least (for whatever reason) and you'll win. Going into decline intelligently is the only real reason that this game has any strategic element.

It's a good game in the sense that in my gaming group I used to play it with, basically everyone won once in a while and we always had fun, but I can't rate it higher than 7 because I don't feel like there is much going on.

[Initial Impression: 8] 
Very in-your-face with 2 players. Conflict is refreshingly unavoidable. Feels quite light, but packs a lot of interesting twists into a quick playing time. Much of the interest will come from exploring the interactions between powers and trying to optimize the choices available at any given moment. I really like how the board position changes quite rapidly from turn-to-turn.

After a long time i had a chance to give this another try. This is an interesting choice which race should i take and go on till i finish with decline. However this at the same time grants a huge amount of luck into it which i don't like. I would play this game again if im asked to but im sure i won't buy it anytime soon. It was on my wishlist before but i removed it after we played it again today.

A very good, fast playing fantasy game. It's all about area control, fantasy races and their whacky special abilities. It's all about timing, pick a right race-power combination at the right time etc. Gameplay is simple enough to be taught to almost anyone very fast. Game has a high rate of ductility because of all the expansions. There's a ton of different races and special powers and even game boards can be adjusted.

Reanalyzing my rating, I don't think this game holds up to similarly rated 8s.  I rarely have a desire to play this game, but once it hits the table I do have fun.

It rewards blind kingmaking, attacking the apparent leader based on memorization.  It also offers diverse army types, but you'll have seen all of the armies and modifiers after your first game or two.

There's nothing particularly bad about the game, but at the same time it's not the most fun either.  I still can't pinpoint quite why this game doesn't click with me.

I don't know how I feel about this game.

I have played it 3-4 times and feel conflicted on how much strategy is involved in this game. I think it should probably just be played lightly with not too much thought on what the best move is, as there is a lot of variance of usefulness of the different race combinations.

The Good: Easy to learn, high replay with ability/race combos, plays fast, good flavor, and pretty.

The Bad: Kill the Leader syndrome, tougher on last player in 1st round for the free land-grab, good but not enthralling.

The Ugly: When the board is full of chit, not easy enough to distinguish between races, especially on the Decline side (a different border, maybe?).

Overall, fun replayable game, but not sliced bread. If this had a theme song, it would be Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

FUN little game; can be brutal if players gang up on one player, but that will usually cost themselves VP's.

Downgraded this to a "6" after a few plays.  The ganging up feature can really be annoying... if you're the one being ganged up on, and if you don't go after the perceived leader in the game, that person is most likely going to win.

It's a pretty good game, but It's hard not to dock it some points for the dysfunctional art: Sure, every picture by itself is very pretty, but once we put all the pieces on the board, it becomes way too busy to make heads of tails of the situation.

Having Vinci, I don't think it's worth picking it up.

RATING: 7
What happens when you combine the simplicity of Othello, and subtlety of the computer game 'Life', and a fantasy setting? You get Small World. It's an area control game, where you have a finite number of units to conquer and spread out as much as you can to get VPs. The number of units and their unique capabilities is dictated by the race cards coupled with a variety of special powers.  Races and powers can be coupled differently from game to game, making each combination unique and highly sought after. Some can be game-breakers. The play is fast, with a very simple decision tree: 1) Conquer and expand, 2) Gather VPs, OR Go into Decline. If your race has reached as far as it can into the map, it can choose to go into Decline, making the race go away, so to speak, so a new race+power can be brought onto the map. The race in decline continues to generate VPs as long as their counters remain on the board--think residual income/VPs.

Components are gorgeous, standard Days of Wonder fair. Rules are well written.

Game is short enough at 60 minutes, that it will get plenty of plays early on, but the trend seems to be burnout, as players get familiar with the board and race+powers. Still, the fact that the board changes to accommodate 3-4-5 players is a plus. We'll see if it has staying power.

Update (08/28/10) 3 plays: I still like it, but others in my group are burned out, or turned off by some of the outrageous race-skill combos, or the cutthroat nature of the game. I think it is a matter of learning to identify a very good combo when one sees one, grab it, and play it effectively on the board. Still, it is possible that one may end up with some lousy race-skill combos. The flip-side is that great combos result in very good scores, that invite leader-bashing (and subsequently not winning the game), and allowing some other sleeper player to win.

Update (01/22/12): Initial rating an '8'. Do I want to own this? No. Do I have a sense of urgency to play this?Not really, but I'm open to playing it from time to time. Downing to a '7'.

A nifty little tactics puzzle.  Played quickly with the full compliment of five.  Everyone agreed that I won because I was allowed to go about my business unmolested.

[b][COLOR=#FF0000]NOTE:  THIS GAME REQUIRES MOLESTATION[/color][/b]

Looking forward to playing it again.  I doubt my rating will rise, though it could fall once the shine comes off...

UPDATE:  This is a great game.  Very simple rules means that it's worked as a (gasp!) [i]gateway[/i] game for absolute n00bz.  Also, the tactical and strategic depths are both deceptively shallow—meaning that the obvious simplicity of the "pick up/put down/score" gameplay hides deeper decisions...  When to bunch up into a hard knot and when to spread thin?  When to decline?  Who do you pick on, and how?  The timing of these issues is what decides the winner.

Also, there is no shortage of absolute dick-moves in this game—I recommend mouthguards and running shoes, or someone's gonna lose teeth.

I have ended up thinking that this works better with fewer players.  As a three player game it is quick and fun.  As a five player game it seems too long and the chances of you being wiped out by your neighbours for no particularly good reason are a lot higher.

The novelty (ooh, flying orcs!) wore off quite quickly but it is still amusing and your ability to recognise a powerful combination is still a very important skill to do well in this game.

I finally had a chance to play it this weekend.  We did not get to finish but we did have enough rounds to see it in action.  I'm rating this one a bit high because I think it has a lot of appeal to a number of gaming styles and is far easier to play than the rules might indicate, as is the case with most games.  The bits are nice and there is likely a lot of replayability considering the race bonuses which can turn an otherwise weak race into something to fear by all (Flying sorcerer).  I will complain that the box insert is not the same as is shown in the rules and does not accurately accommodate all the race tokens.

An Eurogame of aggression management. You have to decide each turn which player are you going to attack and then arrange your leftover troops in order to be less likely chosen as another player's victim. Usually you attack for points optimization, with the ocassional backstabbing to screw-the-leader, but you always have more than one optimal choice, and your decisions will be important on the long run.

JEM 8. szám:

Szűk szomszédságban megesik az összezördülés, tartja a mondás, ami többszörösen is megállja a helyét egy olyan méretű világban, ahol egy népligetnyi területen próbál többségi helyzetbe kerülni minden népség, ami valaha fantasy címszava alatt. És ehhez a hangulathoz a grafika óriásit dob az egészen. 
Bemutató / Small World
A Small World játékmenete nincs túlbonyolítva, és nem nehéz megtanulni a szabályait sem. A játék során különböző képességekkel megáldott fajokkal csatározunk egymás ellen. De nem ugyanazzal a népséggel játszunk mindvégig. A pontszerzés mellett a megfelelő időpontban való távozásnak is mesterévé kell valamelyest válnunk. Ha úgy találjuk, képtelenek vagyunk aktív fajunkkal eredményesen játszani a továbbiakban, hanyatlásba fordíthatjuk, egy kör múlva másikat választva helyette.  
Több körre kicentizni stratégiánkat felesleges, mert itt egyik másodpercről a másikra dől meg a stratégiánk. A körök fogynak, így teljes hadjáratok kidolgozására ritkán van lehetőség, és felesleges is, mert a túlélésért fogunk egymással küzdeni. 

A fajválasztás adja meg a Small World sajátos ízét. Minden fajnak megvan a maga erőssége, sajátos képessége. A fajlapkákhoz képességek lapkái is kapcsolódnak érdekes és használható, vagy mihaszna népségeket létrehozva kombinációjukkal. A sorban az első fajt ingyen vehetjük el, minden továbbiért egy pontnyi érmét kell letennünk az azt megelőző fajkártyára, amit az kap meg, aki azt a fajt választja. Egy új faj a határ menti területek egyikén kezdi meg Small World térképére vonulását, és innen tovább a szomszédos területeken át. 

Nagyon népszerű játék, amelyet a rajongók a hangulata illetve az erős konfrontáció miatt szeretik. Nekem egyik sem jött be, és bár elismerem a játék előnyeit, de nekem mint megrögzött euro játékokért rajongónak ez nem tetszett.

I always think I'm not going to enjoy this game and then when I play it, I have fun. I like the replay-ability from the random combinations of race and ability. Don't let the silly artwork fool you, though - it can get a little cutthroat! Though there's a lot of direct conflict, which I tend to not like, I think it feels natural with the built-in "decline" factor where you can retire a race to start a new one so it ends up feeling like a natural progression of empires through history.

Suits such a wide range of different players. Rules are light enough for beginners but tactics are heavy enough for gamers. Luck is a big influence but still low enough to make skill count towards a win. This game straddles a perfect mid-point to interest both first-time players and regular-gamers which is an uncommon feat. Easy add to any collection.

Too much counting...it`s boring to wait for every player to count his/her score after every turn. It`s a good game, with nice components, but 1/3 of the game is just counting points. The game tells you that you have a bunch of variety, but that`s just an illusion, Small World is quite repetitve.

RATING: 4
It's quite easy to teach to new players & people seem to enjoy it but it does seem really repetitive to me & even a bit fiddly.  At a high level there's really only one way to play to win (i.e. get the best race available to you & maximise your points).  

I also have trouble figuring out what each player represents.  Are we leaders of a whole bunch of different tribes?  Are we Gods?  Thematically, why do we score points?

I think my rating will slip further & my only reason not to trade it will be that it's easy to play with newbies.  I don't think that will be a good enough reason in the long run.

No, just no. A lot of people like to think Relic Runners is Days of Wonder's worst game, which is wrong. The game isn't an approachable game for many reasons. There is a ton of abilities and powers to keep track of for a game that has easy mechanics. Too much to teach from the get-go and the game is just ok. It's like Race for the Galaxy, as far as explanations go, but that game is way more exciting

The thing I love about this game is that it is relatively simple and almost completely strategy-based. There is very little luck involved and that comes only once per turn when "challenging" a territory. And even then, challenging can generally be avoided if you're not a risk-taker.

RATING: 6
A reduced version of Vinci that benefits from being lighter and shorter. All the interest lies in the combination of race and special ability and there's fun in choosing your next race to play. Like its predecessor it's a highly mathematical game of eking out small advantages, putting your empire into decline when there's more to gain by starting another. It also retains the huge chaos factor in who gets attacked and who gets left to go on scoring. It's left entirely to the players to balance the game, the degree of wisdom involved in this being the main determinant of the outcome. One to enjoy, not one to take seriously. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good but not great game, a small improvement on Vinci due mostly to the hidden scoring, however the theme is silly and I don't like the look of it - too hard to tell who is what.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Look, it's Vinci with more art! It's funny how the cluttered board makes the game system seem less intuitive, but in its heart, it's still a brilliantly simple game of timing and deterministic conflict.  The predetermined length of the game makes the ending seem more artificial, but it does make the game shorter and keep everyone in it (on the other hand, it also means that the game was, in essence, a tie and victory was less significant).  The die--eh. I don't see that it was necessary to remove rules like the contiguity rule, but I guess it didn't make a huge difference.  On the whole, about as good as Vinci.Which is to say, it is a really good game. Some of the special rules with various races are a little tricky to get straight (4 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
"It's a small world of slaughter after all," or so the box cover says. And it's right! Small world is such a cut-throut game. You start out with a random assortment of fantasy races to choose from (each of which have it's own special rules), combined with that, the races are paired with a random assortment of abilities. Orcs become Pillaging Orcs, Hobbits into Flying Hobbits (personal favorite), ect.

This is an area control game where after each turn you total up points for all the regions you control and any special bonuses from races and abilities. These points are kept secret and after 8 rounds, the person with the highest number of points wins.

This game has great replayability due to the randomization of races combined with abilities. Though it does take a little while to play, it is best played with the full compliment of 5, though 4 works just as good. But even if you have 2 or 3 players, it does come with special boards for those amounts.

Pros: Fun. Addictive. Tons of variety and customization. Quick to teach and easy to play. Everything a good game should be, and what I've come to expect from DoW. I picked this game up on a whim, having never played it before and knowing little about it, and I am thrilled I did. The interchangeable nature of the races and powers (280 possible combinations with the base set alone) means it's never the same game twice. I find even non-gamers can enjoy this, including people (like myself) who don't generally care for direct conflict / war simulation games like Risk or Axis and Allies. SW is much more simple than those, while still having that thrill of territory conquest. I have played with 2-4 players and find it scales very well, and is just as fun with 2 players, even if it loses some of the multi-front interaction of a larger game. Be sure to remove the Diplomat power for 2P.

The races and special powers fall largely into 3 categories: Offensive bonus, Defensive bonus, or Terrain Type bonus. I play equally frequently with all 3 types, and it is fun adjusting my play strategy multiple times in one game as I switch old races for new ones. 

Cons: In general the female races of this series are rather sexualized, and some people I game with have found this tasteless. That and the sorcerer character looks a little too convincingly like a devil worshiper! Artwork aside, this game is fun and one I will come back to again and again.

First played April 23rd, 2009. Taught in 10 min, played in 1hr with 4 players. This game has good luck strategy mix. It's worth a play if you know someone who has it. A center board has teritories on it and is populated with a few decline races. Mountains defend at one more. 5 random races and 5 random special atribute are placed in groups of one each next to the board. Each race has a special ability (destroy 2 armies, recieve 1 army, etc) to go along with the special atribute tile (+1 for hills, etc). Each player is given 6 VPs. On each players first turn then pick a race groups. These groups are order and if you take the lowest of the 5 groups it's free. For each one going up, you pay one VP for each one you pass by. Later, when another player takes that race, they will recieve the VPs that another player placed. After you pick a race or on your next turn, you battle with your active race. You will generally have 9-11 armies to start. On your first turn, you entry from the sea or land, unless your race doesn't allow that). You win the battle by placing two armies down for an empty tile and one additional tile for each army or mountain on that territory. Some races give you extra defense or deny other players from attaching, etc. If you already have armies on the board, you may take all but one off of each territory and use for battle. If you take the last one, you will no longer control it. Each battle must be adjacent (unless you have a special ability). On your last battle, you may battle with less and use the die to assist your battle totals. Die is 0,0,0,1,2,3 pix. At the end of your turn you get VPs for each territory you own and perhaps some bonus VPs for certain conditions. In later rounds, you my choose to place your active race in decline. That will be your entire turn, except for collecting money for active and decline races. Once you send a 2nd race into decline, the previous race is replaced with generic decline race and you no longer get VPs for that race. Winner has the most VPs at the end of round 9.

Finally got this to the table after 9 months languishing on the shelf.  First play was a disaster and left us cold. After realising that we had made three big errors in how to play, we tried again. Much better and looking forward to round three. 

Update: Fun, quick 2-player game. My wife enjoys it as well since you don't always have to attack other races. Plus the fact that she has won all our plays so far doesn't hurt her assessment. 

Update: 2 1/2 years later and our oldest son (8) is really getting into the game. He loves the races and powers on offer and has easily grasped the gameplay. Enough so, that he fairly stomped me into the ground on his first go. Second round came out better with daddy scraping out a 1-point win.

RATING: 6
A solid game. It suffers a little from being way too cut throat with two players, and even three depending on which civilization/bonus combos come up. The game gets a little monotonous if you play it a lot. You have the exact same options every turn, there are no cards to gain bonuses or throw the other players for a loop. Every time I play, it just feels like a tug-of-war between me and whoever is near me on the map and I ultimately can never gain much more headway than my initial land grab with that civilization. It gets very same-y after a while. You end up investing a lot of time in setup for how long it lasts too. What this game really needs is a modular map (there is a fan-made expansion to achieve this.) The board being exactly the same every time makes no sense for a game like this. Even the special regions that confer bonuses for certain combo cards stay the same exactly every game. I wish that the special regions were decided by tokens instead so that at least something changed a little on each session. Same with the positions of the starter "NPC" units. Otherwise the game just gets very boring after your fifth play-through.

I'll try it once more I reckon, but I really don't "get" this game.  It's absolutely mind-numbingly dull to me.  Get some guys, optimize their distribution and movement, take from other players then watch as they do the same, then it's back you and you do the same thing, ad nauseum.  Oh, but there are "silly combos! Watch and laugh as your friends get undead dwarves!"  Wow.  How amusing.  I could look at endless permutations of fat/gassy/striped zebras/orcs/leprechauns.  I'm sure you can feel the sarcasm dripping out of your screen by now, so I'll let up.  I guess they had to hide the fact that it's an exercise in optimization.  Will almost certainly be the next game I trade away.  "Cave Troll" does the tit-for-tat variable-powers thing in a way that's actually fun to play, and I suggest steering that way.  There's no "here" here.

I got this game 3 days ago and already played it 4 times. So i think that means we like the game a lot uptill now. 
We still have to figure out what the best combinations are. But i find the game a lot of fun! 

Update : 
This game is great! We both love to play it. Once you get the hang of it it plays pretty fast and still you have to use stratetie to get as many AP as possible each turn. Timing is pretty important in this game. 
Im gonna put up my rating cus i think this game is very good!

One of the people I know and whose opinion I value once told me that Cosmic Encounter is the game Small World would like to become. That is why I didn't buy it at first. But after a couple of plays I got to understand he was wrong. Although the diplomatic/gang up against aspect is at times way more vicious in the CE, Small World is in no way inferior. Plus, it is a really great 2 player game me and my significant other fell in love with after one play.

Tentative rating.

Really like the mechanics and replayability.  The game speed is a plus - although it definitely makes the game feel more tactical than strategic.  Actually feels as if the game always seems to end a turn or two early.

Vinci is supposed to be a "longer" version of this game.  Really makes me want to try Vinci.

Aug09: Not bad at all. Played 3-player and went really smooth. I mis-valued a couple races really badly and came in a distant last, but still enjoyed it.

Distinguishing flipped tiles is a nightmare, but the rest is smooth as butter.

Over 30 games and counting. Marvelous theme and basically simple territory control mechanics. Best with 4 or more, feels shallow with 2 or 3. Sometimes a powerful combo can dominate a whole game, it's not so nice when that happens.

Kind of does what it promises: squeezed, shorter, more fast paced Vinci. However something is squeezed away too much which leaved, at least me, unsatisfied after few plays. To add insult to this injury it happened couple times that the game was dominated by pesky elves that could never be wiped away nor limited in any such way that would have mended the game. First and last reaction is that the game mechanics are flawed when it comes to those damn elves, maybe not in every scenario but still enough to show its worst in two plays out of very few more.

RATING: 9
Area control game from Days of Wonder, which certainly enjoys the outstanding production values that their games have a reputation for.  The amount of tiles you get is amazing, and the boards (two double-sided boards in the box!) are vivid and beautifully drawn in the fantasy style.

The game involves picking a race and special power combo (which are drawn together for all players to choose from) which grants you a certain number of tiles of that race used for invading the areas on the board.  The mechanics are very simple, the invasion cost is 2 tiles plus one tile for every tile already in that area (if any), but the race and special powers offer discounts for invading, or grant more victory points for controlling certain areas.

A game in which the theming is phenomenal and the gameplay is fluid and easy to learn.  Highly recommend this one.

I love playing this game SO MUCH!!! I LOVE taking over THE WORLD!!! It is A LOT of waiting with 5 players, but I think 3 is the most without TONS of waiting for others to attack you and ruin all your hard work of spreading people across the "small world". This game is A LOT of fun!!!

I got ahead of myself in buying this game. I played it a couple of times with some teens, and they enjoyed it which got me hoping that they would play some more games. Their enthusiasm was short-lived and mine was never really there because there are not enough different types of play for my taste. It feels like Risk, a game I never really warmed to, with a greater variety of armies.

The theme and idea were superb. Game play was kinda dumbed down for gateway gamers. I did loe this game dearly as seeing the combos pop up were hillarious and I loved playing different matchups. Sadly this was not a hit with my gaming group as some said it lacked depth and others didn't like having to look up every power and race combo as they came out or went to buy them. :( Still I think it is a fantastic game and will play it if anyone brings it out.

Played for the first time tonight, didn't use any expansions, just learning. Even with the two games, though, three players, the variety was awesome.

I had a feeling this game wouldn't be a good fit for me, but I preferred to ignore that and bought it when I saw it on sale.  I was hoping to prove my feelings wrong...well, I didn't.  I have only played this 1 and a half times, but that is enough for me.  I have played other games 1 time and loved them, not this one.   There is just too much for me to remember I think.  The powers, the abilities, the points, in decline or not.  I just don't like games with a lot of variables in them I guess.  I can certainly understand some people thinking it is a 10, but it just ain't for me.

RATING: 1
I regret buying this game. At first, the concept seemed really awesome, with race and ability combo always being different and the art style looking so rich. The gameplay sucks though, I tried getting into it but it's so dull, nothing exciting ever happens. You don't know who's leading unless you write down the points that everybody gets and although each races are have different abilities, they all feel "passive".

You either can do the action or you can't, and you go for the best move every turn, but in the end not enough amount of luck can make anything really turn around, nothing ever gets exciting, you always know what to expect and at the end when it's time to reveal the winner, everyone's like "Oh, ok."

The best emotion I felt from playing this was feeling glad that the game was over, and I didn't care if I won or lost because you can't get a feeling of accomplishment from this. It's long and boring and it sucks. I'll probably use the material to invent some game of my own because otherwise it feels like a waste of money.

I played another game from the same company, Five Tribes, this one is awesome. I just don't understand how they could release Small World, or how after testing it, anyone could feel enough to think it was a good idea. It feels like half a game, like it's missing the most important thing of all...

OWNED SINCE 2013
The Small Worlds are good games, but I do not think SM and SM Underground are both necessary. We originally bought both base games together, instead of 1 base game and several expansions, so that way we would have more races and abilities. I think that many of the races are too similar, and I wish I had bought only SM Underground. But now that I have both of them, I do not regret it (there are still several races and abilities that can be mixed and extra maps is cool). Just that if I had it to do over again, I would only bought SM Underground.

Fun game, NOT A GATEWAY GAME.  This can be a gateway game if your group has previous experience with D&D, video game rpgs, or if you are trying to convert risk players into better board games.  I don't recommend it as a gateway game because there are a ton of special powers in the game that are randomly combined.  It's not only overwhelming for non gamers, it's really hard to discern which power combinations are better.  

This is a game that I have to put on the shelf for now, until my groups have become more accustomed to board game mechanics.  I just feel like it is way too much to start people out on.

That being said, I do really really really like this game.  I used to really enjoy risk before I got into board gaming, so this is right up my alley, and the special powers are a lot of fun.  Just be cautious who you try this with.

Fantastic illustrations, mediocre game.

:thumbsdown: A simple game where the optimal strategy is to take the path of least resistance to maximize your score while using diplomacy to convince your opponents to bash the leader for you. The problem is, points are easily tracked and negate the tension needed to keep all players invested in the end-game.

I could be convinced to play this game if the 1/3/5/10 coins were grabbed randomly at the end of each turn instead of gaining them on a 1-coin-per-territory-basis.

Nice light "wargame". The key decisions are when to decline and which race/power combo is currently appropriate. These decisions are relatively easy to make. Fantasy theme heavily throughout. Doesn't attempt to be balanced; relies on the players to balance it (and so I don't really think this plays well with 2...or at least it can't be taken seriously). Significant downtime with 5 players.

Basically a fun version of Risk. I enjoy this so much more than Risk for a few big reasons: one, it's not nearly as long; two, no one gets knocked out and has to sit around waiting for everyone else to finish; and three, it's a lot less luck-dependent, with a die only playing a small roll (pun intended). I think this is the game that is most owned by other people I know (other than maybe Catan).

RATING: 7
This is a very good game where every player takes control of a different race with an special attribute and tries to expand over the board conquering as many locations as possible. The game is very straightforward, you just have to put tiles over each location and then just count how many points have you achieved, it may sound as easy but the thing is that the game has strategy and every occupation has to be considered carefully. 
I think that the two best mechanics are: the race+attribute combination and the decay. The first one allows the game to be replayable, the second is maybe the key of the game. You just can't conquest the world with one race, sooner or later, the race loses its capability of expansion and needs to be replaced by another, at that point, the race has to be set into decay. Knowing when is the best moment to do it and which race take as a new active one, is the most important strategic aspect of the game.
Positive:
1. Easy to explain and play
2. The different boards that adapt the game from 2 to 5 players
3. The decay mechanic
4. Race+attribute combo
Negative:
1. It is pretty possible to have a race and attribute combination excessively powerful. That can break the round
2. The game is very easy to play, but is important to play it quick. There are not that many things to think about
3. Due to the way the game is, it may be overlooked by experienced players

My kids love this game. It's a game that looks more complicated than it is. It's a very light and simple game with an amazing game mechanic of variable races and powers that randomly change in each game. That makes this game very replayable and entertaining. At times you'll see a race and power combo that is overpowered (Merchant Skeletons are crazy!)but getting to know those powers allows players to get better each game- which also lends you to want play again. The great art work and components are well organized in the box insert. You could call this a funny, fantasy version of Risk, but this game is more balanced, more accessible and more fun than Risk. Great family game, but don't expect a highly strategic gamer's game. It's comfortably in the Family Game/Party Game category for me.

Wow I am glad I did NOT fall for the hype over this one. 

Essentially a filler game that takes too long. LIGHT, Fluffy, quick and breezy game that works well and has lots of cool power combos.  Decisions here are really minimal and that is my big complaint here.  Really you just decide where to spread yourself out, which race to take and when to decline it.  A nice game, just too light for me to consider owning or playing though it could work as a gateway but I have enough of those that I feel are much better than this.  Repetitive rinse and repeat feel, 9 rounds was way too long, 5 might have been much better.

Gekregen op mijn 39e verjaardag van Anneken. Veroveringsspel; kies/koop een volk met een speciale eigenschap en verover regio's. Per reeds aanwezige vijandelijke troepen, bergen, etc. heb je telkens een raskaartje meer nodig om de bijhorende regio te veroveren. Aan het eind van je beurt krijg je punten per regio die je dan bezit. Je kan je volk in verval laten gaan en een nieuw kopen/kiezen. Wie na een vast aantal rondes de meeste overwinningsmunten heeft, wint. Tof spel, ideaal voor de leefwereld van Ward (9).

Takes a game or two to really get a feel for when you should decline and choose a new race and how best to maximize points while doing that. The fact that the VPs are kept face down keeps you from realizing just how badly you're being thrashed which lets you keep enjoying the game since there's no moment of clear realization that it's mathematically impossible to win. Eventually the game turns into a somewhat repetitive numbers crunch, but it is still fun, albeit a little long.

I never liked Vinci so I was disappointed to see that the games have many similarities. However I think the races add just enough theme and flavor that I actually enjoy this. It must have been the blandness of Vinci that I didn't like.  

**UPDATE*  No, it wasn't Vinci it's the game system that doesn't intrigue me at all. Dropped my rating.  I'll trade the game itself and maybe play it occasionally on my tablet.

This is a great Risk alternative.  I really enjoy the different races.  It makes the game interesting.  I'm glad that its not just based on dice rolls.  I don't mind randomness but too much dice rolling can be quite frustrating in a game if there is no way to mitigate the roll.

An all too small world.  Each player has a race with a special power and a special characteristic.  Each gets a round of conquering spaces on the board and getting points.  Then the next goes.  An interesting mechanic where one can give up on the current race and start in with a new fresh race.  Timing is very strategic on when to do so.  Short but intense games.

Small World could work as a more accessible replacement for Risk, but the game suffers from an intolerably slow pace (I typically spend 80% of the game waiting on other players to make their moves), luck of the draw (the order of the race tiles can often determine the winner), and victory being dependent on the whims of the players.

I have better success at this when I just try to ignore what's going on around me and just play my game.

Makes me want to play Vinci again to see if my memory of it being a better game than this reworking is true.

This new version of Vinci (ie. Small World) does have some things going for it though... easier to see in decline civs, plays in a fixed number of rounds, though the art work is worse (not as practical) as Vinci.

I guess I saw a quick area control game with a fantasy theme and a good rating on this site and thought this is something that could genuinely be "better than Risk". It's fun, but it's not really grabbed me the way I thought it would. I'll keep trying it from time to time, but I would insist on the interpretation of the rules that leaves your pieces thinly spread across the territory they've taken (not emptying squares voluntarily and creating kick-arse stacks until the start of your next go).

It's like Risk without any of the bad parts. It's so much fun to play and has tons of replayability. Smart race choices can change the tide of the game. My only con against the game is the victory coins—I wish there was just a track; you'll generally have an idea of who is winning.

Great area control game where you take control of different sets of quirky races that come with their own special powers and effects.

That said, the powers get old once you know them by heart - the "way cool!" factor has diminished. That said, knowing that your fortified trolls are much stronger than those diplomatic dwarves is useful.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2010)

As its usual from a Days of Wonder game, I heavily dislike Small World. It was advertised to me as a Risk variant with much less luck. I would play any Risk over Small World any day. Also usual from DoW, the game is gorgeous, but I feel it has very obvious decisions. Very shallow and boring for me. All the players attack the perceived leader (I have come to dislike this), so the player who lay low the best, will be the winner. The best combo race vs cost is painfully obvious.

The race combos are very unbalanced. The game feel very repetitive after two turns.

I recognize it is a good family game (as all DoW games I have played) or to introduce new gamers to our hobby. For now, I refuse to play this other than in an iPad.

Smallworld is a great strategy game! It's really simple to learn and play, and yet every game is different with all the different character/power combinations. It also has nice expansions that add a lot to the fun. It can be a bit long with 5 players, I like it best with 3 or 4.

RATING: 7
Another instance of game designers and companies confounding my expectations.  I thought a redone Vinci couldn't possibly work.  Turns out a lot has been fixed.  Maps now scale with number of players, which is a very good thing.  The adjacency rules between active and declined civs no longer apply; these rules always struck me as due to counter limitations anyway.  The reduced penalty for skipping civs makes skipping more viable.

My reaction to the hidden VPs (assuming no one's tracking) is mixed.  On the plus side it's no longer a huge get-the-leader fest like Vinci was.  It's not always obvious who the leader is, though a good player should have some idea.  But with that introduces more diplomacy as players try to make their case for why they shouldn't be attacked.  In many games diplomacy is a nice addition but in Small World it's a nice term for "whining," and I've certainly done my share.

In the end I fall on the Small World side of the SW/Vinci debate, I think.

I'll have to play a couple more times to decide whether this is a 7 or an 8 for me.

This game earns and loosing points for the same reason. Its simple there for its easy to introduce ( very small learning curve, but not easy to master) but then again i feel for my self the game just doesnt have enough going on for me, you only have a couple actions you can do. Sure i guess their are strategies to the game but its more based on if you can select the right race but i dont feel like counting how many victory points every combination may possibly get me.  I still play it with my mom ( because its simple enough) and a friend of mine that likes the game but i rarely suggest it my self.

I love this game.  It's gorgeous and amazingly easy and also provides tons of variability through the race/power combinations.

Played this once and that was enough for me.  Fantasy themed BG with nice artwork...did I mention it had nice artwork?  In all fairness though I only played it once so I should try it out a few more times.  It's just with all the other games out there it'll be a stretch to get this on the table again.  My first and only game play I ended up winning...and I couldn't tell you why...haha.  That tells me one of two things, either I'm to thick to recogonize the intricate strategies surrounding this game or it's just too terribly random to establish a sound strategy.  Given it's current rating I think most would tell me it's the first reason...but again with so many other great games I'll probably not play it again to even reevaluate it.

Not a bad game, but not a great one either. In a nutshell, there are better games out there that have more intriguing gameplay. This is certainly a good entry point for strategy games, but just felt anticlimactic to me. 

Also, the board in insanely busy. It's really hard to tell where your troops are at a glance. I think the game would have benefited by either toning the board down or using some sort of pawns instead of cardboard tokens with a washed out side and a colored side. Everything blends together.

Some better things than VINCI and some worse. I like the Races and the variety but keeping what's-what straight on the board is a bit of a problem. I also hate concealed VP's, what if I just write down what everyone has when they get them the next time, would there be a point in hiding the VP's? It really felt like civilization building in VINCI while this feels more like a fantasy placement game.

Had a chance to play this with my friends. With me knowing only the basic rules, and very short 10 mins explanation by good cafe staff, we jumped right into this game.

And it was a miss for the group. The game itself was very simple, but not knowing exactly what moves were valid left us frustrated. Only if one of us knew the game inside and out to explain to us, then game would have been a lot better so I cannot blame the game, but bottom-line was the first game really wasn't fun. With repeated plays, and better understanding of rules, I can see this one might climb up the scores but for now, it is a mediocre game for me. And game is way too light for my taste as well. I could see kids would be loving the hell out of this one though.

And...another reason is I am simply not a fan of this kind of competitive, war-like, risk-type games. It gets to my head for some reason.

To me this game is just a simple attack, attack, conquer the territory game with cool racial powers. There are only two things that I like about this game are art-works and a lot of variety of special race powers. The game-play itself however fell too short for me to like it.

Not my kind of game. Missing the key element I require: tough decisions. Every move pretty obvious; you only need to decide which "race" with its "special powers" and when to put it into "decline."  I also hate fantasy themes, which didn't help. Nine turns seemed both too short for a real game and too long for how boring it was. Plus I hate games with so many and types of tiny cardboard pieces. (Would I like Vinci?)

Great game with awesome artwork. The fact there are different boards for different number of players makes the game very balanced. I really like the theme and 'lightness' of the game. It is easy to explain and a lot of fun to play, due to the always changing combinations of races and special powers.
Still, due to the fact there is not much luck involved, it can also be a game of skill for more experienced players.

Really great game. I think I've gotten a little soured on it lately because I played it too much and because it's really interaction heavy- (i.e. you have to play politics over strategy in multiplayer games). I have probably played nearly 100 games and have all expansions. I do think that expansions actually make it a little more unbalanced. The base game plus Underworld races only would probably rank 8.5 from me.

Small World may not look like much on the surface, but this is wonderful game of tactics, decisions, and subtleties. Gameplay is fast, intuitive, and engaging.

Finally got around to playing this after seeing all the hubbub about it in the "Is Small World a wargame?" anguish and subsequent nerd rage. 

It's a finely-produced mini-civilization game. I enjoyed all the different races and the way you combine them with abilities--they give you plenty of combinations for replayability. The rules are straightforward and a double-sided player aid is really all you need. The art is a bit busy. Maybe it's just too many colors with too much saturation. It doesn't seriously detract from the game, just not quite my stylistic preference. 

It's not a wargame. Not even remotely close. Sorry. The fact that people can call the interaction between two races "combat" just astounds me. I'm not sure what to call it...maybe "replacement"? Combat to me implies that both sides are involved. That isn't what goes on here at all. You can optimize every play you make, and the "decision" of when to put your race into decline isn't much of one, because you'd have to be really thick to miss the right time to do it. 

Now that I have a daughter, I would evaluate this completely differently as a way to spend some good quality time with your family, especially children old enough to play. My comments above should be considered as a reaction to playing it with your standard game group of adult men and women.

Based on 1 play: Shorter version of Vinci with a fantasy theme. The game plays over a fixed number of rounds as opposed to ending once someone reaches a fixed number of victory points. The game feel much shorter and there is no duplication of abilities until they recycle which seems unlikely. If given a choice I'd play Vinci over this since I like seeing more civilizations come into play and they feel more varied.

Finally got this one in a trade! There are two things that this version of Keyaerts' design has over Vinci. First, the theming is much stronger and more appealing to more people. Second, this game is well-supported with lots of expansions that continues to inject variation and thus replay-ability over the original.

However, Small World does not fix the fundamental flaw with Vinci, which is that there is no game arc and the game end is entirely arbitrary. You could end in 8, 15, or 20 turns and it would have no affect on the game other than length.

I love Small World but its important to find the right group to play with. I found people either really like it or are really bored by it.

Beyond choosing the optimal combination of races and powers, the decisions are somewhat obvious and  uninteresting. Deciding when to expand and go into decline (the crux of the game) isn't difficult to decypher. The hidden scoring is a mixed bag; it helps to limit AP but can encourage those adept at manipulating others to bash perceived leaders. 88-86-86-82 last game.

This is essentially a variant of Risk, but with some important differences.  

First, it's built in a fantasy world, complete with dragons, orcs, elves, and dwarves, etc... There are actually a good amount of differing races, each of which have their own personal benefit and will require you to slightly adjust your strategy.  Moreover though-- and herein lies half of the genius in its design-- the game setup combines these many races with a various special power of some kind or another which ultimately makes the game unique and different for each play.  

The other half of the genius of Small World is given away by its title: the board and its marked areas are most definitely small.  The board you will use (all of which are included) is decided simply by how many players there will be.  This is because, unlike Risk, there will be very little room for expansion without direct contact of another player after the first turn or, in some cases, even on the first turn!  The result is that you will be interacting and competing for territories with everyone else early and often.  

Finally, the racial decline feature is a great addition that allows for a player to choose when they want to retire, i.e. put their current race/power combo into "decline," thereby giving them the opportunity next turn to select a new race/power combo while still collecting victory points for the declined race, so long as they remain passively in play.

Small World isn't the most complex game or the most interesting if you're looking for large amount of detail or multitude of choice.  Once you grasp the central idea of the game, any decision making is mostly effortless and can sometimes feel unrewarding since What Small World does, it does well.

Seems better than Vinci in every way, but especially in the theme.  Vinci/Small World is basically a game where you beat the tar out of each other and score points for holding regions.  While it KIND of works as an epic civilization game, it works so much better as a quick fantasy battling game.  Great fun!  The hidden points thing is silly - keep the points revealed.
Update (13 plays):  still good fun but 5 players is pushing the limit with down-time and overall game length.  Given that the game has no actually 'progression' in terms of moving towards a goal, it needs to be short.

The rise and fall of civilizations is a fun thematic idea, but it is not capitalized on here as well as you'd like. Small World will be fun once, or twice, or three times, but mostly for those not too deep in the hobby.

New Comment:

Small World is more about comedy than anything else. In the right environment, I suppose it could be a dream come true. As a game, it's a bit simple and even with all the "combinations" of races and powers, it feels repetitive. I don't play this for an engaging game experience. I play it because there are flying tritons and commando giants. I do give DoW credit for parodying the fantasy genre; it was ripe. 

Gameplay description: you draft a race with a specific augment. You put ~10 counters on the board. You have to outnumber other players with your counters to take over territory. Your race slowly weakens as you get thrown out of provinces. After 2-3 turns, they hit a breaking point, so you retire them and draft a new race. There's obviously a bash-the-leader style inherent to this type of game. There are some tactics to which territory you try to take and hold, especially if you can sequester a retired race. But the gameplay is pretty thin.

I didn't appreciate this game as much the first time I played. The idea of letting your race decay seemed odd. Then the second I found it making sense. A lot of the fun is figuring out which race and special ability combination will work the best for you relative to the other players. Then it is a simple military expansion until you are stopped. At that point decay race and start another. If you are set up well, you can continue to gain points from the first race.

This gets less plays than it's predecessor Vinci, mostly due to three things: 
1. The theme (Fantasy) which doesn't add much to the game IMHO
2. The fact that this game has a lot of expansions makes me feel that the game is not finished, never complete.
3. The map (gameboard). To be specific; the art on the map. The map of Vinci is much simpler and doesn't have so many distractions.

Small World has just one advantage over Vince - it is faster.

This game has been played more than any other immediately after receiving it.  I love that it is easy to learn and pickup especially for those who are newer to boardgames.  The game plays well and can be quite comical at times.  Only issue I've come across so far is that every once and a while a very powerful combination comes up and left unchecked can lead to easy wins.  Other than that great game!

Starts with the same rating as Vinci. The main difference is the division of peoples and traits to define your civilization while in Vinci two civilizatory traits were randomly combined. The new civilizations have noticeably different special abilities which are more balanced in combination. On a few peoples (namely the Elves which can't be eliminated) I'm not sure how to play. In our game the Elven player never led them to decline. The second noticeable difference are the hidden victory points and the limitation on 8 turns which help to avoid the strong kingmaking drawback of Vinci. A drawback is the confusing graphic which was much clearer in its predecessor. Slight advantage Smallworld after first play but not enough to justify trading Vinci for it.

It takes the dice away from Risk, which I would compare to taking a loaded gun away from a small child. Risk has ruined a few of my night when the dice do not shine down upon me favorably.

Improves in many ways over Vinci -- less analysis paralysis, quicker game, better theme/flavor. However, it's still highly vulnerable to player (mis)judgments about who is winning, inviting them to attack the perceived leader. It's often tough to counter-act others' mistakes (e.g. when the player on the other side of the board is ignored).

EDIT 12/25/10:  I think it takes repeat plays to see the diversity and depth here, and I'd really consider it mostly a 4P or 5P game.  Rating increased from 7 to 8.

Small World is a well-built but rather boring machine, a bit like the Euro game equivalent of a wood-paneled station wagon. That may be a bit too harsh, but Small World fits into the Days of Wonder paradigm of nice-looking, easy-to-learn games with a small number of decisions to make. Even by these criteria, Small World is not a wildly successful game. It's less physically appealing than many DoW games, and the decisions are even fewer than average. Perhaps the only decision I find truly interesting is when to put a race into decline, and even that is fairly obvious unless time is almost up. The race and special ability combinations seem fairly balanced, which is a pretty neat trick considering how many there are (though with only three tokens inherently, the Dwarves do seem rather weak). There is also some amusement factor in odd juxtapositions of race and power, such as Skeleton merchants. The actual gameplay moves pretty quickly, but it has to or else its thinness would become even more obvious. Deterministic combat can be all right--I like Imperial quite a lot, for example--but it feels about as dry as day-old toast here. Maybe it's the fact that combat doesn't feel like anything and the game is set in yet another generic fantasy world, but I kind of just want to play my turn and move on. Small World does a very good job of doing what it sets out to; it's just not something that I'm particularly excited about.

After 10 plays I'm just not excited about Small World. I find it a little boring. I like the theme plenty, but the game play just loses it for me.

Where Small World really shines is the combinations of races and powers, which often result in some humorous moments. Other than that, it's a decent area control game, but nothing spectacular.

Small World is an impressive feat of doing everything completely wrong
when trying to update an existing game. The graphic design is not only
garish, but actively user-hostile. Vinci might have been ugly, but at
least it had some clarity.

The rules were changed to try to patch the worst problems of Vinci,
but ended up just replacing them with larger ones. Hidden but
trackable VPs were probably supposed to take care of the pathological
"beat on the leader" aspect of the game, but instead it just adds a
tedious memory component if you want to play well, or just totally
unbalancing the game if it's not tracked.

The other rules changes don't work at all either.  The fixed number of
turns means that there is way less uncertainty about the decision of
going into decline. Removing the cohesion rule might have simplified
the game, but it also removed pretty much the only rule in Vinci that
made the board play interesting in any way.

SW is utter dreck, and I can't really see any reason to play it rather
than Vinci.

Not having previously played Vinci, it's hard for me to compare, though I understand that points were not hidden in Vinci - this would definitely affect the speed of play, an important element that I like about Small World, as I can see how open scores would slow down the game.  

I don't particularly care for the theme or the artwork - I'm not too big on fantasy themes, so I'm not excited about the theme, but it's not too big of a problem for me either.  I can understand some people's complaints regarding the messy board, but I don't really care about that.  I do appreciate the box insert, complete with counter tray - a really nice touch that is sort of a hallmark of Days of Wonder games, nice attention to detail.

The game itself isn't too exciting, but I like the decisions regarding decline, as well as the amount of player interaction.  There is enough randomness as well to make it unpredictable.  And with the large number of races and special powers, the replayability is high.  It's a fun diversion, but I'm not sure it's a truly great game yet.

Despite looking forward to this retheme of Vinci, I was left a little disappointed. Almost nothing was improved, the map felt more cluttered and less clean, the chits were fiddly, and the gameplay has lost all the rules which made Vinci a great game for me (in particular terrain rules & cohesion rule).

I would liken this to playing the kids version of an adult game. Its a lot brighter, dumbed-down and not a game you would take very seriously.

After a few plays, I still haven't decided how I feel about this one.  There are some things that I really enjoy.  I love the drafting mechanism for the characters and the way the mixing of race and attribute changes what can be done by the characters.  Maybe that is also what I don't like.  You become attached to the character and want to enjoy them for awhile.  But that isn't how the game works.  You get in, you take some ground and then move on.  You never have a chance to get to know them.

RATING: 10
Fantastic game, randomization allows for lots and lots of replay-ability without impacting the outcome in a way as to make the winner random and the different boards for different amounts of players allows it to really play well with any number 2-5 a trait I wish more games had. That said, from my experience in 2-player the second player has a noticeable advantage, but the fact that the first player tends to win doesn't make the game any less strategically fun / deep, just need to impose some form of handicap to their score if you are worried about keeping it even. 

 Even if you somehow play it to death there are so many expansions! I however only have the base game and have played it many many times and still am always down for a game.  Has a lot of strategic depth, but you can also play it very casually as well and have fun either way. fantastic.

Lots of variety generated each game without adding large amounts of luck. Suffers from a strange balance of negotiation, lightness and theme causing it to sit slightly uncomfortably, an area in which I suspect Vinci wins out.

At some point it was our most played game. It gets less play time now, but the warm feelings towards it remain. New race and special power combos each time keep the game fresh. A rather simple attack system is IMHO an advantage, which allows players to concentrate on the more important aspects of the game: which combo to pick and when to decline.

Quick pace, barely-any-luck combat (which is a big reason for the fast pace, but keeps the excitement on the final dice roll), special abilities up the wazoo, but nothing too complicated or weird or that changes the game too much, and with the combinations, every game is different. The maps' sizes are always too tight, which leads to combat and destruction EACH AND EVERY TURN, thanks to a different map for each player count.

Doesn't score as high as Vinci due to the fact that much of the strategy involving the map has been removed. It seems to me that the game places heavier emphasis on finding the best combinations of civilizations at the expense of tactical maneuvering. 

Which makes it faster, but turns an amazing game into just a great game. This is fine by me, of course, I own both.

If I could convince myself to play it more, there's a chance I'd discover some strategic synchronicity that would shape the game play in fun ways.

This is playable enough, but it often feels like moves are too obviously laid out for you, and the flavour is slightly off-putting.

Reduced rating from 6 to 5. It just doesn't offer enough beyond seeing which combinations of races and abilities will turn up. Blatant failure to bash the current leader is also grating whenever it happens, which is always.

I'll play this at any time with open scoring. So far no one has agreed to this.

Picked it up second hand. I've tried it a few times now, it never seems to land that well with the groups I play with.

It seems to be incredibly popular in the community because of the tongue-in-cheek theme and simple, easy-to-learn mechanics. I guess that makes sense, but the theme alone isn't wowing me in the same way it does others.

The game just doesn't seem to have enough interesting decision-making to really call it a full game. It boils down to:
1. race selection,
2. where you start your invasion with said race,
3. when you put your race into decline, which can be sometimes linked to #1.

You will probably put 1-3 races into decline in a game. Which means at most 11 interesting moments in the game per player. And #1 is basically a couple minutes spent reading/remembering the rules for each race and special ability that's available, then picking what seems best. That doesn't sound like much compared to just about anything else that plays in 60-90 minutes. With a bunch of experienced players, this game would probably play in about 30 minutes, and there wouldn't be much to it.

The redeeming factor is the number of jokes you can make about whats going on on the board. But there are tonnes of other activities which facilitate that better... and to be honest I'd rather just get drunk and probably will the next time I play Small World.

this is the simplest game. but hey, you can't deny that is the same kind of addiction that ticket to ride or RA can give. an expert player doesn't even think about the moves after 6/7 games, you are only needed to remember who's leading. and it's really expensive in my opinion. but it's still a genial idea and we totally appreciate it to begin or close every bg session

Note: definitely better with more than 2. It's OK as a 2-player, but with less to dilute the advantage of going first - and only one other person to hammer you if you're lucky enough to have one really pointy ear, like I do - I just don't think it really works.

I won my first game of this, and I might have to lose at it a few times before I can claim an opinion approaching objectivity, but I really enjoyed my first game. I started out as Mounted Humans, with whom I had a poor first few rounds; then moved on to Berserk Ghouls, who I found useful for their special power keeping their pieces on the board, even in decline. It was really my Wealthy Sorcerers who made the game for me, though. I managed not to lose too many pieces as I expanded across the top of the board, and pretty soon I was most of the way down, converting one of my opponent's pieces into my own for the last two turns. 

I like the race selection mechanic. It's worthy of emulation, and creates the sense of playing in a world peopled by empires rising and falling. The fact that you can cut and run on your civilization makes for an interesting balancing act. You don't generally get to be Italy, and just go into decline and stay that way for two millennia. The Spirit ability never showed up in this game, but it could be interesting if it's in early enough. 

I'm afraid there are a few combos in here that might break it, but overall, Smallworld is devilishly fun. We played with five, which may be less than ideal - I think I might prefer four.

Update: this game hasn't aged all that well for me. I'm less and less interested in fantasy themed games as time goes on, and to me, the expansions erode rather than improve the base game.

I do not care for this game and do not understand the appeal. I find it uninteresting. There are essentially 2 or 3 critical decisions each game (when to go into decline) and if you're off by one round for any of them you're going to lose. The entire game is about deciding when to go into decline. Nothing else matters as much. Not for me. I don't get why people think this game is great. I really don't like this one and have no interest in playing it.

Great game. Simple, but with a lot of depth. I am currently addicted to the Ipad version.

The only down side is that though the races hare balanced, a good combo might be a game winner. But this is the price to pay for a game that doesn't play the same way each time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game with excellent components best enjoyed quickly.  Lots of replayability with the different race/power combinations, and a fair amount of strategy from picking them.  Placing your tokens and "combat" is primarily tactical.  Can be a drag if other players take too long on their turns, or if you get stuck with a bad race/power combination.  Also seems to suffer from a kingmaking/bash the leader problem.

approximate number of plays (pre-2017):  1

This is a great little strategy game where players compete for the most points (gained by spreading their armies across the world). The rules are quite simple, but the game has some creative concepts that make it feel unique.

I've played the game more now, and I still find it addicting and enjoyable.  I'm not really too sure what there is I could complain at, the game aims to be a fast-paced fun little strategy game and I believe hits the mark perfectly.  

If I were to try and nitpick, it seems that often the key to winning is to figure out who is in the lead, and then beat them down as much as possible.  Figuring out when you've hurt them enough and when to switch to the next target can be tricky, and is in my opinion where most of the "strategy" of the game lies.  Because of this, newer players playing with veterans can lead to somewhat of a lopsided game, since the newbies may not be able to pick up on this right away, or keep track of who's in the lead very easily.

Fun game. Used to play the app a lot. In real life you can't track what people earned so it creates a bit of tension to understand who is ahead. Classic game for a reason because people who enjoy risk can enjoy this quite well. Solid gateway game.

2014-02-13 - I have a lot of card games in my collection but this is definitely the best BOARD game I own so far. Simple to teach and demands adapting to dynamic situation on the board all the time. You need to stay focused all the time because one or two weaker rounds may cost you victory!

2015-03-21 - 9->8 I got to know quite a lot of games since my rating and Small World is not the best board game in my collection any more. Anyway I still very much like it and it is a great game to introduce new people in boardgaming.

2017-02-15 - Although I like this game I got rid of it. I didn't want to bring it to the table too often, mostly because I got tired of explaining every single race power every time. And with expansions it became even more troublesome.

2017-04-29 - 8->7 - What I wrote above changes my rating.

Great "men on a map" game.  A definite winner in my book.  I know that it is a reworked version of Vinci, but I haven't played that game, so I can't comment on the changes outside of the theme.  I dig the fantasy theme, so this is already more attractive to me.  Another plus is that there is a different map for all of the different player counts.  Cool little game.

This was my FIRST foray into modern board games and therefore, it will forever hold a piece of my heart.

I would definitely recommend this game.

What I like most in a game is having to reanalyze the situation every turn, and decide how my strategy needs to shift accordingly.  No game does this better than Small World.  Every turn brings about new race/power combinations, a new board situation, etc.  You have to think about your choices, as well as the options and abilities available to every other player.  I never get tired of it.

I like how varied a game can be from the previous, and it's all about player interaction and decisions. There's not much luck in this besides what race combos gets revealed, and then it's a matter of whether one is willing to spend the gold for it.

Decent strategic depth for gamers.  I love the active/declined race concept.

I would not play this all the time, but on occasion it's a nice option to have.  It's also surprisingly suitable for 2 players.  I'd say 2,4 and 5 players is best.  There's a strange dynamic that I do not like with 3 players.

I really enjoy this game.  It's relatively simple, the theme is effective and fun, and it plays quickly.  A satisfying area control/light wargame with strategy but without stress.

2017 update: This game had a clear saturation point for me; I don't think I'd ever really want to play it again. But I enjoyed it when it was new, so I think it's worth those first ten plays or so. Adjusted the rating down to reflect its shorter shelf life.

Super fun game and an easy game to teach. We have broken the game out a few times and had a blast each time. The game itself is pretty straight forward, but it is strategic at times.

Awesome & quick strategy game. I don't think it will become the "family game" label and therefore is more a game I could play with my friends and not so much with my girl friend, but it's still really good. 

Right now I like it more than Vinci.

Update:

After gaining more experience with SW it I have to add that the tactical options are more limited than initally expected. But at the same time, the meta-game get strengthened as there are two or three options that might get discussed heavily.

Considering to downgrade it, but would like to play it with bigger groups beforehand.

Update:

Gaming experience greatly refreshed with Priestesses, Gypsies and to a lesser extent Goblins. Those races will be part of further sessions. 

Update:
Is not that much fun anymore. Dropped the rating to 7.5.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to like Small World, but for me it falls short. Typical of Days of Wonders games, it looks great and plays fairly quickly. The name is appropriate, because this game is all about too many unique races being crammed into a Small World, and fighting for control. The game is exceptionally well-designed, with multiple maps for different player counts, and interesting combos of races and abilities waiting to be unleashed against your opponents. However, the game falls flat for me.

For all the cool thematic fantasy races and the colorful setting, the gameplay does not deliver a thematic fantasy experience. It is a dry, strategic numbers game. Every turn is one of bean-counting and optimizing the ability of your units to take and hold regions. As a pure strategy game, it is quite well done. The choices are interesting and the gameplay is quick. However, this contradicts the potentially rich fantasy theme. Your Commando Amazons are nothing more than a stack of cardboard, and every bit of terrain, or defense, or every unit on a region is a piece of cardboard.

I love thematic Eurogames, and I wanted Small World to be one... but it isn't. It's not a bad game, but it wasn't what I wanted it to be.

A war themed game finally done right! They included a specific board for each number of players from 2 to 5, which is a great thing, hopefully other companies will notice, this is a common complaint I have these days.

The game felt too much like Pacman for my taste, basically all you do it attack regions with only one unit of defense. Simply using the map meant for (players - 1) players fixed that problem (i.e., if you are 5, play the 4 player map, if you are 4, use the 3 player map, etc...). After 6-7 plays, the game starts to be all the same, even with the high number of possible race + power combinations.

Now I know what all the hype is about and I like it. This is a fun game with the variable strategies and special racial abilities and magical abilities, never the same game twice for sure. I actually won 1 of the 2 games I played, by 1 point I believe as I had sorcerers with pillaging, nice combo! Kind of would like to just play this game without an ending point, 8 turns almost seems short, barely enough time to get 3 races out and have enough time to "set up" for the final turn rampage for best gold possible.

This is just not hitting the table. Can't get any interest going at home and my gaming friends have their own copy. Trading for something that will hit the table more.

1st play: Interesting though fiddly. Not sure I played it correctly because I don't understand the fuss over it. Needs another few plays, may need the modular board to be happy with it.

RATING: 8
A game of conflict for 2-5 players (or 6 with certain expansions). Players choose a unique race paired with a special power and over the course of the game a player will put their original race into decline and continue with a brand new race, possibly several times. Points are earned each turn for territories controlled on the always crowded board.

It's a pretty simple game but each race will be paired with different special powers from game to game so you have to re-evaluate and consider new combinations each and every game. Choosing your race/power combo and timing when you go into decline (to pick a new race/power combo) is an essential element to doing well. However, the game is also about territory control and since there is very little luck in the game planning ahead and anticipating (or encouraging) opponents moves pays off.

Some players claim it is obvious what the best move is each turn but it's really not about getting the highest score you can on each turn, it's about consistently scoring. A high score this turn that leaves you exposed and out of position for the next two is not necessarily as good as a moderate score this turn that leaves you in a strong position. 

I like the game because it offers new combinations of powers to consider each play and it rewards strategy and thinking ahead while keeping a very simple/streamlined rule set.

Very cool game with surprising variety and depth for a relatively simple rule set.

The different boards based on number of players is a nice feature as well (I like this better than blocking off part of the board). I am looking forward to many more plays of this one.

I grew up playing Risk.  Now, Risk is a great game, but I just don't like leaving it up to the dice.  Many times, if I roll bad, I can have a whole continent taken from me.  This game, although a region control game, has more strategy involved and I really enjoy that.  No more dice rolling, well, except for one, but still, this has been alot of fun within our group of gamers.

One word: meh. I was very dissapointed after first game, where everything went wrong: long punching, freaking elves that can stay on the board whole game, hidden scoring = no fun at all. As for now, it doesn't work for me as a 2-player game, but I'm willing to give another try. I hope that I will be able to convince my wife to play it at least once more.

It's a bit better after the second game (the game was more balances and tense), but it won't be hitting our table too often. Perhaps a multiplayer with at least 4 people will work better, but for now I'm staying with 4 ranking.

RATING: 6
Before anything, let me state this: Small World is an abstract in disguise. While this is true for all games, the fact is Small World is an area control game with pretty illustrations.

The game's meat resides in the decline mechanism: players can skip a turn to make their current race enter in "decline". Races in decline still count towards area control for their original owner, but can't be moved and loose all special abilities. The key of the game is exploiting the decline mechanism to the maximum.

Another important mechanism, though not as crucial, are the races' special powers. Not only each race has its own characteristic power, but each will also be accompanied by a unique characteristic which will grant him another special ability. Players need to gauge the impact the available combinations may have on the board.

Despite conflict being its main focus, Small World is quite friendly. Firstly, combats aren't particularly deadly. Secondly, even if a player is wiped out he still has the chance of making a comeback with another race. Due to this, it works like charm as an introductory game for fantasy geeks, as it's eye catchy easy to learn.

But its cute appearance is a ruse: the game is extremely unforgiving. Enter decline a turn later than you should and your chances to win the game will be drastically reduced, enter sooner and you will be at a disadvantage too. I wouldn't mind this at all if not for the fact a player may not be able to tell when exactly he should enter in decline. It's always obvious in retrospective, but in advance? Sometimes it's plain impossible, which leads to a false perception of depth, as entering in decline is more of a "push your luck" move than an informed choice. While most declines are a matter of skill, I'd say one out of every four declines is a matter of pure luck. Considering the severity of the consequences, it's not a percentage I feel comfortable with.

Small World is a fun and light area domination game. The decline mechanism is both what makes and breaks the game.

Essentially a reimplementation of Vinci with a fantasy theme. I like the fixed number of turns and the different maps (both in function of the number of players). Deciding when to go in decline with your race is still one of the key elements.

This game is a lot of fun with great replay value, it's very similar to RISK but adds a ton of new dimensions such as fantasy races to play as each with special abilities, and power ups that are randomly handed out to each race giving great replay! The best part about this game is that it involves rapidly changing world domination that never kicks anyone out of the game...  Your race dies?  pick a new one and charge in full throttle!  There is also a time limit which makes it so the game doesn't take DAYS to complete

RATING: 3
Played once with 4 opponents. the races and prefixes were fun. The idea of guiding a series of races through a world has some god-like appeal, but a joke like My Seafaring Hobbits will enter the coast there only lasts that long. Would not recommend it. Far too over hyped. Perhaps it is nice for children age 6-11, but still too many rounds, children do not have the attention span of 2 hours where 75% of their time it is not their turn.

-1 Gameplay was lame. you choose race, expand, then it dies. 
-1 you conquer without any combat. Defender cannot defend. Pushing your luck is done with a die. 
-1 Much downtime, esp. when going into decline. Turns take too long.
-1 Only some races were useful, e.g. amazones and wraiths. 
-1 Overall it felt empty and a game should not feel like that. 
-1 too many pieces too much setting up.
-1 The game takes too long. 8 rounds is far too much. 6 would make it just bearable, but then going into decline becomes too costly in some relative way; in the end I feel that developers knew it and someone still decided to push it out into the market.

Rating of 6 is for the IoS app small world 2.

I think I will rate the boardgame a full point less.
It's straightforward but the races and special powers as the decline scoring will make this game vulnerable for people who suffer from AP .

Probably a 2 or 4 player face to face game for me only as in a three player game because of my winning record I will get beaten to a pulp :)
But in the IoS app it shouldn't play a role.

Oh and surprisingly little going on. I had vinci or small world on my physical boardgames list but i think i don't need them. 

Oh and i log three plays on Ipad as one play. So I played 6 games so far on sunday 19/01

RATING: 9
The game is very simple, almost silly at first glance but it's great. It's full of interaction and there's no tactics that let you win- you always depend on others' choices and the better you score in one turn the more beating you'll get from your opponents because there can be only one winner in the end. So you have to keep balance between playing carefully without becoming too big threat to others and being able to strike a blow in the right moment to get most points. 
It's like a miniature of a strategic war game which takes about 1,5 an hour instead of 6-8 hours.
The game is very well done, the artwork is funny but nice and consistent. The game feels rather light though it gets people angry sometimes. Great replayability.

This game hits the table way more often than all my other games, both among gamers and non-gamers. I found it to be a good gateway game: it has a great theme and is quite easy to learn, the ability to go into decline and pick a new race allows players to make up for mistakes made earlier in the game, the dependence on other players' actions and a tiny bit of randomness keeps people from over-thinking and micro-managing for hours, so the downtime is minimal, even with 5 people, and there is enough strategical thinking involved for the game to be still interesting for me after like 100 plays. Simply put: the perfect game :)

It's made even better by adding some of the races/powers from the expansions, and removing the underpowered dwarves.

The artwork is super cheesy, but the game is fun and has  randomizing mechanics that give good replay value.  Once players are familiar with the basic rules, turn play goes fairly quickly, minimizing boredom when it's not your turn.  This is a fight-for-territory game, so there is an unavoidable element of screwing over other players.  Those who dislike strong competition, or who hold a grudge, will want to avoid this one.

Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.

Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!

Great game, with tons of fun combos to experiment with! Unfortunately, a lot of people are blind to its true depth. If your strategy is to "spread out as thinly as possible as quickly as possible, go into decline, wash, rinse, and repeat," then you pretty much fail to see the game. A lot of "hardcore" gamers have dismissed this game as something much shallower than it really is, some even going so far as to call it a gateway game that becomes "solved" after a few plays (which is simply beyond absurd). It has a great deal more strategic depth and psychological intrigue to it than that!

In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.

Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.

Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!

Played twice, 4p & 5p.  Yep, it's Vinci.  What's improved: graphical representation of civilization (now in the form of race/special power); different maps for different numbers of players provides more tension.  What's worse: map is too busy, which everybody says, but it's true; some races and special powers unnecessarily complicated (Sorcerers for example); flippin' huge player aid.  What I didn't care about: the die.  I'll play again, but not chomping at the bit to do so.  BTW, I hated the hidden VPs...

A newbie friendly / casual version of Vinci overflowing with theme and awesome bits & board.  Unlike many, I have no grips with the readability or packaging.  Gameplay wise, it suffers from a severe "bash the (supposed) leader" syndrome.  It's a bit too wargamy & unpredictable for my taste but it's good fun when people want something lightweight.

I get why this game is so popular. It is a good introduction game for non-gamers and you can play it fairly strategic. 
Get the "Grand dames of Small World" and "Cursed!" expansions or else you'll run out of races (in a 5 player game).

RATING: 6
First of all, I played vinci and I made a free re-edition of the game before small world was released. So by taking a look at small worlds it's like wanting to know what does the original designer has changed compared to my re-edition.

Die roll for the last attack: Nice idea since it allows you to get rid of your leftovers tokens, but the odds are so low. 

Hidden scoring: Many people said that hidden scoring is better. It could be true indeed. This is why I added it to my re-edition of vinci.

Fixed turns: I have nothing against a fixed amount of turns, but 9 turns is not enough. In vinci, the average amount of turns was 15 which gives you much more time to decline and get new civilizations. In the last game, I could use only 3 civilizations which is way not enough.

Theme: I like the retheming of the game even if there is a lot of fantasy games out there.

Component design: The game has too much colors and graphics, it's really hard to analyze the board and it is especially hard to analyze where each civilization is an who owns it. For example, all decline tokens are gray, and the color of tokens is not associated to the players so you need to check which player owns which civ. Also the civ colors are very light making them hard to be recognized.

No component reuse: There is no reusing of components, they sometimes made components that could only be used by a specific race ability. The problem with this is expandability and the price of the game. If you want to add new races and abilities, you also need to add new tokens instead of reusing the old ones. But that it still a publisher's choice.

Fixed troops amounts: The number of troops you get does not change with the amount of players. The problem is that the coverage of the map won't be the same according to the number of players. So there will be more or less empty space.

Rule of Cohesion is removed: I got nothing against that, it just makes the game simplier.

New map: Taking a fictional map was good, but why not have a modular map to make sure that every game is different. It would have also be possible to adjust the game better between 4-5 players and 2-3 players.

Price for the civilizations: I am not sure that paying from 1 to 5 points to get better civilizations is enough. In the original game you paid from 2 to 10 and ended with somewhat the same score. So I think it is not expensive enough.

In overall, I prefer my vinci re-edition that smallworld.

I like the theme better than Vinci and most hardcore Vinci players prefer this and I tend to agree.  Small World, like Vinci, replicates the ebb and flow of civilizations/empires in a medium-weight game.

Early rating but I see this game as an improvement over Vinci, which I also own.  Small world is much more playable with only two and the end game is more satisfying.  The rules are also simpler, which will allow me to play it with my children.

I really like this far better than Vinci.  I'm sure Vinci purists will shudder at this statement.  The speed of the game (limit of 8-10 rounds max), theme, fun, different powers and bonuses, and hidden scoring made this a much more enjoyable experience for me.  I've always found Vinci to drag much longer and outstay its welcome.  Small World ends almost too soon which is much more preferred - makes going into decline potentially a difficult decision as there are only so many turns to use different races/empires!  Kudos to DOW on a solid re-imaging of a classic.

Small World was one of my gateway games. When I got into boardgaming early this year, this was the third game I bought after Tsuro and Ticket to Ride. But while I still enjoy Tsuro and TTR and I still play these games regularly, Small World started hitting the table less and less. While it's a gorgeous looking game and the gameplay is straight forward, I also came to the realisation after 15 plays that the game was.... rather dull. 

The deterministic combat, the placement of chits, the counting of area's that you control... It's all a bit dull because when it's one player's turn the other players aren't engaged. They don't have to be because there is nothing for them to do when it's not their turn. I kept hoping that the next game with the next group would be the exciting game that would make Small World come alive for me. It never happened. So it was time for me to find a new home for my copy.

I'm kind of undecided on this one. I like the variety that is inherent in the game, but it seems to have a rather limited decision tree, which shouldn't happen for something that is so varied by it's own nature.  It might be that i just need to play the game a little bit more to see what strategies may have been overlooked, but after a few more plays if I just don't see it, this one will definitely come down in it's rating.  Top notch production quality.

Update: I had originally played this one wrong, but after playing it again correctly I still feel meh about this. Pretty much everyone else who played the game felt the same way. There is definitely more strategy than what I first thought there was, but still there isn't all that much.

The races do give some variety and the timing of sending things into decline is interesting, but it doesn't perhaps have the full satisfying punch of its ancestors (Britannia, HotW, etc.). It does have the advantage of being playable in less than two hours though.

I like this reworking of Vinci.  The components look better than the original (although they may be harder to distinguish on the board).  The reinforcement die adds a nice element of randomness without fundamentally unbalancing things.  The power combinations are clever as in Vinci.

This game is a whimsical gaming experience for a lively group who appreciate the novelty of the various races and abilities. The mechanic is simple to learn with good player interaction.

Overall a fun experience but not earth shattering.

Really wanted to love this, it has all the correct signs but it didn't work for us somehow. It felt like the best thing we could do was just get on with things on separate sides of the board and leave each other alone. I rarely saw much reason for attacking each other. Again, maybe I'm missing something and it has been a long time since we've given it a chance so who knows.

RATING: 7
Wonderful bits (tiles are easy to remove when you buy the game, special tile shapes, nice and sturdy boards, etc.).

More varied (in terms of theme, and tactics) than Knizia's Samurai, but lighter.  Lighter than Caylus Magna Carta or even Through the Desert.

After playing a few games: I don't feel like I'm much in control, when playing; I don't have much visibility.  For instance, the "wipe race out" effect prevents any great story arc to take place: each time you pick up a race, you almost have to start afresh.  Plus, it is somewhat hard to count on any specific race+ability combo, as other players might get the race that you had in mind before you know it.  This makes the game somewhat lack strategy (but tactics is present during each conquest).

Update after playing 35 games, mostly on iOS: the race choices are the main choices I need the game, and they are meaningful. This is where the main game is (with just two or three moves in a given game!), along with the choice of going into decline. The rest consists in having a correct strategy and tactics for the occupation of regions, but this is easier and less rich (but interesting: how to group or spread your troops, how to shut off the opponent, where to position reinforcements given where your opponent might want go, etc.).

The game is light because choices each turn are limited or don't have many obvious consequences. This feeling is compounded by the fact that I don't see clearly in the consequences of my choices, so I am not very much immersed in the game. 

The races are relatively varied, and the expansions add some really interesting twists (Cursed, Grand Dames, … Fear…). 

That said, playing fast on the electronic version is nice: 15 minutes makes the game denser and therefore more interesting. This is a great way of exploring the interactions between races and an overall strategy. 

It may be that I don't have enough practice and am not able to make longer term plans.  Maybe knowing the races and powers better would help me better judge the potential power of each combo, and make more strategic plans.

There is no real story arc (even Agricola or Race have more of this). Instead, the game can be summarized as the couple of races each player got.

The iOS version is a BGG 9, for me, thanks to its identical experience, but condensed in 20 minutes. 

 Globally, I feel that beyond some basic strategies related to regions (mostly based on protecting your in-decline race with your active one, and avoiding the sides if possible in preparation for future new races), the most important choices are the races. Since there are only two or three such choices in a game, this is how much demanding it is. This is why I prefer the constant decisions of Race for the Galaxy, and why I am not such a big fan of being stuck in corridors in Space Hulk, as the order of the line of space Marines is a choice done only rarely. 

Less "lethal"/aggressive than Colossal Arena.

I've now played this twice - once with 2 kids which was lots of fun and once with a mixed group of kids and adults which was less fun because we split the play over 2 nights and the adults didn't really get it. Although it seems like a fairly simple game I think there's a deeper tactical layer there - knowing when to use a good combination of races and powers, knowing how to use them and knowing where to use them. The final scores between players have been close in both games (c.30% spread) so it looks like every point counts.

Small World is great for fans of medieval fantasy that don't take themselves too seriously. The theme is well chosen and well executed. The race combination system, the deprecation system and the attack system that form the heart of the game are all very elegant mechanics. And let's not forget the happy elves! Small World is easy to understand, fun and fast to play. Although it might suffer from "kill the leader syndrome" and may be a tad too automatic to play, Small World is another excellent casual game from DoW.

Las claves del juego son 2: 

1) Elegir ciudadosamente qué raza en qué momento (para hacer muchos puntos de una tacada o bien para contrarrestar a los rivales) SIN QUE IMPORTE demasiado el coste de compra de dicha raza, pues la mayor parte de los casos, si es la raza adecuada en un momento dado esa inversión resultará rentable.
Hay que tener en cuenta qué combinaciones son útiles para hacer muchos puntos y cúales para neutralizar al rival. Para hacer esto último, si es necesario abandonar las regiones que ocupas y empezar de nuevo en otras más próximas al rival (ó en las que está él) no lo dudes, hazlo.

2) Saber cúando poner en declive tu raza activa; si exprimes demasiado tu raza activa puedes obtener menos ganancia de dinero en algunas rondas y ponerte en desventaja con respecto a los rivales.

Nota: Una forma fácil de ayudarte a tomar estas decisiones consiste en, si tienes buena memoria, ir calculando la diferencia de dinero entre tú y tus rivales(en positivo o negativo), o bien, el total de puntos de cada uno ronda a ronda, como prefieras.

This game is amazing. If anyone plays Risk, this is the answer to it. The first thing that i noticed is that one gives back coins to skip certain classes, and all coins are secret, so the person thought to be ahead never is. Also the combinations are amazing, so one race/ talent might never show up. Add in a couple of fun expansions and this game is MASSIVE, much bigger than the 10 turns allows. We often play this game once a night, two or three player, although keeping track of all of the pieces can be a challenge. I would love to give this game a ten, but one player usually runs away with it, scoring tons of points off of one or two good runs. Interestingly the games are usually pretty close, and the strategy is complex. It takes about five minutes to learn and everything is well labeled and divided. Also the instructions are laid out so everyone can see what every creature does whenever they please. This is a must have, if only to play every once in awhile.

A fun social game of territorial battle with easy base rules and variable combinations of races/abilities that allow players to "break" the rules and keep the game from becoming formulaic. 

Multi-player games require that all players keep an eye on the suspected leader/player with the most powerful combination of races/abilities to keep the game close, but this is still plenty of fun to play even in games that aren't close.

The slightly cartoony artwork was attractive enough to get her interested (she got a kick out of the "It's a world of slaughter" tagline).  I think this approach made the fantasy theme a lot more approachable than usual.  However, the gameplay didn't quite work for us.  We both liked the variety of ability/race combinations, which helped keep the game fresh.  Being able to decline your race and enter the game with fresh troops is another aspect that reduces the mean-ness of the game.  In contrast, the battle aspect felt a lot more like chess---since it was deterministic, it felt more like an optimization puzzle.  

With two players, the game felt even more calculating and zero-sum, although still with some interesting decisions---do you conquer new territories (usually for cheap) or attack your opponents (usually more expensive but costing them points).  As a result, the game loses some of the fun and becomes more mechanical.  My wife in particular didn't enjoy that.  We're eager to try this with more, since that might introduce enough randomness to make things more interesting.

Wasn't one that appealed at all - had a game and quite liked it.  Probably wouldn't buy it, but happy to play.  First game had an experienced player butt in and help me quite a bit, which was a bit annoying - would prefer to maek and learn from my own mistakes.

Fantasy element is pretty light-hearted - with five it got a bit confusing at times as to who had what - especially once races go into decline.

Small World is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's simple and an ultimately shallow game. You win spots with hardly the use of dice and then the turn quickly goes to the next player. What scores for me is the amount of fun I have when playing this with my friends, there's so much banter going on throughout the game, plenty of interactions, diplomacy, pleading, begging, resentment and cheering going on throughout most of my games. Yes, I say most because my partner doesn't care about this game and this saddens me a lot, as I would love to play more of this good quality, silly game.

Technically I was playing with a significant rule wrong, but I think I have enough of a feel of the game that I can give at least a tentative rating. The special powers of this game and how the combinations always change can be really cool, and there is a little bit of a spatial aspect with some races getting bonuses for certain regions, and central regions generally being harder to get conquered. However, I didn't like how abstract the combat was, and really disliked how busy the board looks. If it wasn't for the business, this game could be quite easy to teach to new gamers, but due to it it makes the game look a lot more complicated than it actually is, and it is really easy to miss some of your pieces (and this is coming from someone who generally will sacrifice some function when it comes to good art).

Small World is a good game that is easy to pick up and play with any game group I have played with.
It lacks exploration in its depth though.

RATING: 7.5
had high expectation of the game due to the theme and high rating on boardgame geek, but after playing a 2 player game i can only give it an average rating. The components are very beautiful and well designed, however i found it quite fiddly. The rules are not clearly written and i found it hard to teach ppl the game (too much exceptions in the games)

played a 4 player game and the feel is quite different 
i think it is a light war-game and with its simple mechanic makes it not so daunting for new players
there are lots of different combinations which gives it good replayability.

We love this game because:

1.The artwork is superb. The maps are especially outstanding - evocative, colourful, inspiring. 

2.The races and their abilities are unique and complimentary. 

3.The special powers add such variety to what a race can bring to the table. 

4.The set number of turns helps you to plan but also adds tension.

I do not get why anyone likes this game besides for thematic reasons. The combinations of race and class introduce so much randomness and can be horribly imbalanced. And there’s just a fuckton of little pieces. Basically, I think this game is all theme to a degree that makes it not fun. And that doesn’t even account for the fact that I don’t like area control. I’m approaching this from the perspective of someone that does like area control.

Sometimes it's not about originality. Sometimes it's about the additions to the game when there's a reprint.

The racial and special power combinations really make this one fascinating. Further the scalable nature of the game via the different board sizes for each number of players make this game play the same regardless of how many are playing it.

What we have here is Vinci; Vinci with a pile more chrome and features, with very little extra weighing it down. Our first plays were VERY tight, and everyone involved really liked this.

Entertaining reworking of Vinci, the rules are nicely smoothed out, the conquering of regions is straightforward.  The addition of the final attack dice roll is fun, though the extra randomness this introduces can be a bit much (from a confirmed dice-a-phobe - though it seems the dice tend not to like me so it is mutual).  I enjoy it and it does not overstay its welcome, though I would not get too deeply into it - it is at its best when enjoyed as a light-hearted game, with opportunities for a little trash talking, the ohs and ahs of the dice roll.  Would keep this away from someone who gets too into calculating every possible angle.

A great example of what a difference theme makes.  I'm not even saying that I love the theme, but it really does help to create a unified, consistent experience.  Small World really does kind of feel like a place, in the end, simple and abstracted as it may be.  Strategic and tactical elements are wholly distinct, but each essential.  It's lively, simple, deep and fun.  I don't know what all the hating on this game is about, unless it's about the degree to which the came has a case of the cutes.  Which it does.

RATING: 9
This really is a brilliantly designed game, Winning requires cool, detached deliberation and abstract reasoning, but it has all the life and color of some of the most whimsically decorous Ameritrash games. Perhaps the best part of it, though, is its cleverly shaped learning curve - learning the rules that one needs to know to start playing is ridiculously easy, but figuring out how each of the races and powers can help and hurt you once you've started is a deep and intellectually demanding enough task to make the game hugely replayable. 

My only very minor quibble is that the mechanism of putting races in decline makes it hard for the player to feel that there's any consistent flavor to his own style of play, in the way that a player of Puerto Rico can say to himself "I'm the Indigo guy!" or a player of some deep co-op game (Battlestar Galactica, say) can exhibit a consistent pattern of making one specific type of contribution to the team. This isn't the sort of thing that's likely to bother Euro fans very much, though.

Simple, quick and fun. Even though there are many combinations of races that are available, the general game mechanics are quite thin. This is such a simple and lighthearted game, with classic cliched characters, it would be a great candidate to appear in major retail stores alongside Blokus and Sorry! Sliders. Any child can play this game. It's so simple however, I can't rate it very high, and after playing, I took it off my shopping list. Would be a great family game.

Small World is a solid family/group game that is easy to learn and still has room for strategic thinking. I think Solid is the right word for it, it's a fun game that will never let you down, but I don't geek out over it the way I do about a game like Arkham Horror. Definitely recommended.

RATING: 6
A very simple area control game.  You get a race with a special characteristic.  You use that race to conquer lands in a "small world".  The mechanic is simple to take territory where it is one more unit than the territory and the number of other "cardboard" pieces on the board.  You can then send the civ into decline as your whole move on turn and get a new civ.  Players should "kill the leader" but hidden vp's make it ambiguous.

Brilliant game!

All the subtlety of a Euro wrapped in a Fantasy Wargame.

The Humour is childishly funny (Flying Dwarves, Seafaring Halflings...)

The Strategy is not just restricted to:
"Run around with BIG armies and conquer as many regions as you can, then when your army starts to weaken it put into decline, get a  new army and start all over again"

You could do this but remember it's not RISK !

If you do play it as a simple RISK style Crush and conquer you'll find yourself been outscored by more crafty opponents.

The twist each fantasy race adds to the game is excellent.

Luck in distribution and draw of civ/power combos somewhat mitigated by mechanic of folding one civ and starting over with another.  Brevity of game can lead to runaway victories, however, given the overpowered nature of some combos.  Lightweight, and definitely requires that all players anticipate that type of experience.

This is an area control game similar to war games like risk. BUT due to the light theme and unique gameplay, the games feels more enjoyable for most (except war game purists). As Scott Nicholson puts it, a person who enjoys the first 30 minutes of Risk and then gets bored is the type of person who would enjoy this game. Other benefits to the lite-gamer is the relative quick (aka "compressed") play of the game and the very straight-forward rules.

Great Description: "it's similar to 'Risk,' but its over in an hour; and there's very little luck involved."

See comments to Memoir 44.

Big hit with my game group.  Fair bit of randomness - but a lot of fun.  We enjoy that there is no permanent player elimination and that the leader is not always ganged up on, since victory points are hidden.

Edit: great as a 60-90 minute 4/5 player game.  Not much fun at all as a 2-3 hour 4/5 player game. So if your group has AP, beware.  A multiplayer game of this is too "random" to play for 3 hours.

Rated 7 after just one 5-player game.

Weird fluke, that there isn't enough races for a five player game. Once everybody has one race in decline, there is only four races left to lay up and chose from?!
____________________________________________

After more plays ...
Stays a 7, and I wonder if the fun and flavor wouldn't be even better if they had stayed in europe and used real cultures and traits from a magical reality interpretation of history? 
So you could have Druidic Teutonians, Vendetta Samies or Etruscans in Viking longboats ... IMO the game would tell better and funnier stories that way.
___________________________________________

Even more games later: Down to 6.
Having the most pointy ears is too much of an advantage: First pick of races and free pick of starting areas to conquer. In the last round you score first, so the rest of the players will have to pound each other - increasing your margin.
With hidden VP's there really need to be a mechanism to even out the startplayer advantage.
If I did fractions, it would likely get 6½.

This has become a heavily played game amongst my gaming group... its highly replayable due to the variation in which races/powers come up, the gameplay is fairly quick with little downtime, and there's plenty of opportunity for direct conflict between players without the bitterness of player elimination, due to the mechanic whereby players may select a new race. All in all it is a very good return on your time, with a fair number of decisions to be made but certainly nothing approaching brain burning levels. It's lustre is fading for me a little these days, but only because it has come to the table probably over 20 times.

Attractive components, and a fun game with a humourous theme. The super-streamlined system of conquests makes the game easy to learn, but there is surprising depth to the game. The different race and power combinations change in usefulness depending on how the game plays out. Plays well with any number within the range on the box.

Excellent area control game, great know when to hold them and know when to fold them atmosphere. Can be very tense, even with teaching new players the furthest apart weve been points wise is only 10 apart. After that the margin becomes much more slim. Great game and easy to play/teach.

Watered-down Vinci: fixed number of turns (too few!), less powers and... the die?!?
The "engine" of the game is still good, but why to play this when there's a better version around (i.e. Vinci)?
I do not like the "caricatural" artwork as well.

At first glance it is a game full of fun with a lot of possible combos (race plus skill). But in practice it is rather math exercise when you count which combo would give you most points. Very luck dependable. Like Ticket to Ride with more pvp.So for me, rather boring.
I have to admit the game is not that bad. All my friends love it so i had to play it with them. i won 5 last games so i give the game 6.5 now.
It is not that bad and not as luck as i thought. But... the ruleset is one of the worst i have ever seen. There are a lot of decision making what which ability actualy does.

Rating based on one play. First impression is that it's a bit more chaotic than its predecessor Vinci (must be because of the races and powers, because the rest of the game is very similar). SW looks awesome of course.
Too bad the Dutch translation is really poor by the way, if I ever get this game for myself I'll get the English version.
Rating up to 9 after more play. The chaos is tolerable and fun in its own way. My kids will probably love this, so I'd better get a Dutch version after all.

great gameplay
great replay ability
great theme
great quality
causes laughter in the same moment you have intense rival-inducing conflict
works great with 2 players and works just as great with 5

This is my top pick for a good competitive game.  I grew up on risk and love it but this outshines it by far.  Its a slaughter but the intensity stays at 10 where games like risk slowly die out.  If you think your crushing your opponent its more than likely their just crouching before they pounce. 
If a player is "killed off" they just come right back with more, faster than if you let them live.
This game does a great job keeping the same board but having the player be random.  The opposite of the norm and it works great!

the only thing keeping this game from a 10/10 is its not for everyone, the random deal even with it being out for all seems to bother the fair seekers

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Take control of one of the race / power combinations available and fight for control of the small map.  Once you're spread too thin, put your race in decline and take control of a different one!  Different maps depending on the number of players ensure that it's always the "right" size.  Fun game with solid mechanics.

RATING: 7
With different races in a fantasy world, you try to conquer as much land as possible. 
A very simple conflict handling mechanism makes this one of the simplest and fastest playing "war" games in the universe. But actually, you never feel as if you are fighting a war because of the colorful material and creative use of races and their abilities.
Normally not my type of game, but because it plays fast and doesn't take very long, the game is finished before it becomes boring. 

Minus: 3 - 7 - 10

This game gets a lot of attention in the webz and because it also looked great I went and got it.
Unfortunately the first game I played of this was way boring. So thought my 2 opponents.
The second time I played it with 3 opponents and while it was a little more interesting this probably only was because I was winning. 2 of the 3 opponents thought it was boring, the other one thought it was ok.
I would'nt recommend to get this game, though it probably just isn't my taste of game.

Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!

Adequate reimagining of Vinci.  I don't really care for the die, though.  That may be because I almost always roll blank.  

Also, I'm a little bitter because a hobbit player with the dragon power pinched me so I couldn't expand on the turn after I had just started a new civ.  Rather annoying.  Best I could do was make sure he couldn't win either...  That, and he has now lost the metagame.

Maybe a turn timer would be a good addition as well.

The fantasy theme is very inspired and draws interest from nearly everyone I've played this game with. The feeling of starting your own race, conquering the world, is a magnificent feeling, really helping this game get repeated plays. The decline mechanic also helps, because no one truly seems left out for too long. However, there is always a feeling of sadness for your race with every decline. The gameplay, however and be a little dry with time, with every decision being somewhat obvious. The interaction of players is nice though, with battles being fought in a clash of chits and a cry of foul play. Not a perfect game, and not a game I will play hours on end, but a solid one. 

Edit: It's honestly not good enough. It's a decent game, but it's just too fiddly and the game is too straightforward. I can see why its popular but I don't think it holds up.

Not being a fan of Vinci, I persist in not finding this upgraded version my cup of tea. I feel like I'm not in control, since the game rewards a high rate of civilization changes. I dump mines fairly quickly as it's necessary to stay in the front lines for the final score, but often with regret.
I agree though that the changes brought in SW are making the game both more interesting and funnier, quite a feat actually, and probably won't turn down a play from time to time.

Very solid little game. Outstanding visuals, fun area control (which is a genre I don't usually enjoy), and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Not a perfect game by any means - it is a bit mechanical, and there are times that I play by rote, but since I'm a very non-confrontational gamer, this game makes confrontation much more palatable and fun.

This game just wasn't for us. It's often billed as a gateway, but we found it wasn't good with new people because of all the special race powers. New players felt like they lost the game in the first round because they didn't know which race was a good choice and picked wrong. And, unfortunately, picking races is the most interesting part of the game. We found the rest of the mechanics a bit boring.

I like this game as it plays unlike anything else.  However, there are those games where you can just get absolutely screwed by the draw of the races and their abilities.  Those games last a lot longer than I care to play.

A light invasion game where players attempt to grab as much of the board from each other as they can to score points.

So, fun for easy gaming sessions but not so good for serious gamers.

RATING: 7
I do enjoy Small World -- mostly for the moments when you get to kill of your friends' armies, or get your hands on some incredible race combo (some of which are very unbalanced) -- but as the game progresses, it can devolve into a pure numbers game and, depending on the number of players, a convoluted math problem.  This often leads to analysis paralysis during the later rounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Small World is everything I wanted it to be -- and as an added bonus, it comes with the most amazing box insert and one of the best sets of components I've ever seen. The counter tray is brilliant.

It's an easy game to teach, but the interactions between the powers and races available and the ones in play, as well as the decline mechanic, put some meat on its bones. It also plays quickly, is just plain fun, and has the right amount of tension and strategy for its weight. Because there are so few turns, the game is brisk -- and every turn matters, from timing your declines to recognizing a scoring opportunity based on a particular race or board condition.

The inclusion of separate boards for 2-3-4-5 players, plus the "rules in one page" summary sheets, really adds more gravy to the gravy that is Small World, too. This could rise to a 9 with more plays.

---

Having now played it with 2, 3, and 4, I can say that it's a lot of fun with 2, really shines with 3, and is saggy and boring and overstays its welcome by about 45 minutes with 4. With 4, I could wander away from the table for 10 minutes, come back for my turn, and leave again -- and I wanted to. It sucks ass with 4.

---

It expands well, adding variety without rules overhead (my sweet spot for expansions). I had to move to a tightly packed Plano box after adding a couple expansions, but it works well.

A really fun Area Control game. Normally in area control i struggle with the war mechanics of dice, cards, bluffs all compounded by special player abilities. BUT here the simple 2+1per obstacle system makes it so easy. The simple scoring of areas each turn instead of lasting for rounds and rounds means you can bank points and then react, instead of hoping to rebound. The ability to build and empire and then scrap it and start over makes this SO MUCH fun! add in the "hidden" scores, means you always feel like you are in the game!

Очень красивая игра с простыми правилами. Каждую новую партию выходят новые комбинации раса\умение, что является плюсом. Игру можно рекомендовать для семейного круга для игры с детьми от 7-8 лет. Вся загвоздка в игре - понять какую расу лучше купить и когда от нее нужно отправить в упадок. Для меня игра простовата, хотя выглядит шикарно и думать конечно нужно. К сожалению, в моей компании эта игра не пойдет из-за простоты.

None of the powers are really that fun or exciting and almost all amount to: you can start somewhere different, use a few more people, doing something costs one less, you get a bonus coin, etc. Which is just all so mundane and contrary to the whole idea of having all these amazing races and abilities. 
Of course, it has to be that way because there are so few mechanisms in the game that the scope for doing anything fun with abilities is limited - there just isn't that much to do. No matter what race I have, I just feel like I am doing exactly the same thing (almost automatically, there are very few choices) with tiny variations.

Conquest game with ever changing rules, and a set time limit. Things that will easily replace Risk for players who don't want to play forever and get mad at each other. I've never played a bad game of it.

Box Insert: I struggle with this one. I want to grade it high, but I think they flopped on a couple key parts. I feel the wells and the slots should be labeled somehow, especially the slots for the race tiles. They did a great job making the race tile tray removable as you need to access it continually throughout the game and it has a cover for tipping safety, but they missed the mark on an unorganized organizer. 

It also desperately needed room for expansions (not to mention the expansions didn't come with actual boxes), or maybe they are planning on some sort of big box. 6/10.

I feel like this could get stale after not too many plays. There have always been a few turns per game where I really felt like I had no interesting decisions to make.

I also worry about how the luck of having a solid race/power combo to pick really makes a huge difference. I love luck in games, but there need to be a lot of instances of the "luck event" so that overall things tend to even out. That way you can have those "oh shit" moments but also not feel like you just can't possibly do anything because of a single spot of bad luck.

RATING: 8
A very fun lighthearted game of conquest. Beautiful components, but board gets a bit busy.   Also, I really don't think the two player version works.  If nice combos come up at the right time (when a player goes in decline), there isn't the third player to balance the benefit game (that is - gang up on the strong player). I think it could skew the game to more luck-based than if played with 3-5 players. Still this is the best new game that Days of Wonder has come out with in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was expecting not to like this but was pleasantly surprised. It does a pretty good job of offering the players some kind of direct interaction without making it imbalanced - we certainly had some good "no, attack him!" table talk when we played. The variety of powers and races should help to put off euro-burnout for a bit longer than normal, although there's not *quite* as much variety as you might imagine constrained as it is by a typically modern, straitjacketed approach to rules.

Also seems to scale really well, even the 2-player version was fun.

2nd best game of 2009 and one of my top10 favorites.
My favorite area control game. It takes good sides of Risk, adds round limit to avoid dragging and adds special powers to the mix for great replayability. You have to be total fantasy hater to not find the special power+race combinations funny (it wouldn't really work as realistic or sci-fi game), and the components are top DoW quality. Expansions add more powers and races and make the game even more replayable.

2-Player Comment:
* There's a different board for every player count, including 2p. "Diplomat" power should be removed from game when playing with two. Small World is very good 2p game.

Expansions: 
+Small World: Be Not Afraid
+Small World: Cursed!
+Small World: Grand Dames of Small World
+Small World: Tales and Legends
+Small World: Royal Bonus
+Small World: River World

Tons of conflict, good for 2-5, very pretty, close finishes, hard decisions, diplomacy, replayability, comedy theme - though rather fiddly. The lack of balance is marked in 2 player games, but in 3-5 - look out if you get what is perceived as a killer attacking combo: you're going to get pounded! Great family game, good laughs. 
Picked it up cheap on iPad; eliminates fiddliness but the AI is weak; it is totally inept against an aggressive opponent and it is essentially trivial to win games by scorelines of about 100-60 by going on all-out attack.
Update to Small World 2 pretty great; still easy in 2-player but gets more challenging and thinky with more players, because the aggressive approach described above collapses.
Have upgraded my rating to 10 on replayability of app; have played hundreds of games against the computer as a few minute timekiller, and I still enjoy it.

Although my "friends" like to say how much I despise this game, I do like it.  It's simple, has a lot of replayability, and challenging without being overly complex.  A great "easy" game for a game night.  My only quibble, it just reminds too much of Settlers of Catan, which to me is the best resource and territory game there is.

Edit. . .I like this game more with each playing.  Have edited rating.

Played again, and I have to say it just keeps getting better the more I play.  To me, the best part is the simplicity of the design.  Yet, there is also a great deal of complexity.

I love small world.  It is such a simple game to learn but difficult to master.  

The thing I love about the game is how little randomness is involved.  While the race/adjective combinations are random, knowing which one to pick to maximize your position on the board to a key to victory.

Really my 2 main complaints about the game are the reinforcement dice, which adds a dynamic I do not like to the game, and the fact that I think the dwarf race is a little underpowered.  Even on my best round with the dwarfs I have only gotten 6 points...I tend to feel that if they don't show up as a first turn pick, it is best to pass them for a better race.

Overall this is a great game and I can't wait to add it to my collection.

A map conquest game where you are expected (and rewarded) for overextending, by a novel decline mechanism.  Expand to claim the points, then let your civilisation wither as you grab a new one and repeat the process.

A fun concept but because people can directly attack each other every turn you gang up on the person in first and there's nothing they can do about.  Although you can't see how many vp each person has its pretty easy to remember who is winning.  If you really want to win you should probably try to stay in second place most of the game which is why this game gets a lower rating.

A solid game. The most critical decisions are what race to select and when to decline. Small mistakes in these decisions can easily cost the game. As such, the game feels somewhat unstable. But as long as it's kept moving and not bogged down in AP, it's always enjoyable no matter how bad your position.

As a player, you really need to figure out who you think is in the lead and take it to that person. Some race combinations, if left unmolested, can really run away with it. The temptation is often to take the immediately best move for you. But the right move is often to damage the leader as much as possible and get your big scores later.

RATING: 9
GAMEPLAY: An area-control and variable-player-powers eurogame. The game has 14 races and 20 special powers which are randomly paired. Each player selects a race-and-special-power combination and uses corresponding race tiles to conquer regions on the board. Players decide when to put their race into decline and select a new race-and-special-power combination. Players score victory points based on their special powers and the number of regions they control at the end of each turn. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds which varies depending on the number of players.

WEIGHT: Medium. The basic rules are not complex but it takes a number of plays to become sufficiently familiar with the abilities of the different races and special powers.

PLAYER INTERACTION/CONFLICT: High. Players frequently conquer regions held by other players, removing one of the other player’s race tiles from the game.

PLAYER COUNT: Scales well from two to five players. Each player count has its own game board. An excellent high-conflict two-player game.

LUCK: Low. Players sometimes use a die roll at the end of their turn to attempt to conquer one region using fewer race tiles than are normally required, but the players’ tactical decisions will nearly always far outweigh the die rolls in determining game outcomes.

RATING: 10
This is a great game.  My one complaint is that I wish each race and power also came with a mini-card (think Arkham Horror) that described its powers. That way you could have two lines of cards next to the race tiles and everyone could easily see what each thing did without having to reference a player aid.

The expansions are great, they add more fun/variety without more complexity/length.

RATING: 8
Awesome alternative to a game like Risk, as there is more strategy/skill involved and less luck, but it's still easy to play. The randomness of the races/powers makes every game unique, and the tongue-in-cheek fantasy theme works well.

Only have the base version. Like others, love the simple rules, accessibility to new players, artwork and the variable race combos. However, it's still a simplified risk with the added decline mechanism. So whether you've got pillaging goblins or flying toasters, you're still doing the same thing. Perhaps the expansions change this, I'll have to find out. Clever and fun, but not the greatest thing ever.

Preliminary rating based on a couple of plays with 2 players. I like the games simplicity and the fact that you can try a lot of different things (read: try a lot of race-ability combinations) without loosing too much points (or even winning). Still have to get used to the war-aspect of the game (read: being mean to your opponent).

Huge amount of great components with a very appealing artwork. My first play was ok but we realized too late of some misunderstandings about the rules, so I need to replay it.

I have played a couple times since the first try but we always commit the same mistakes with the rules! Looking forward to do it right. Furthermore the race tokens are so bothering to handle! 

I want to play anything else rather than Small World currently, and most friends too, I guess this is not a keeper for me. Downgraded to 5.5.

Great art and theme but the ending just isn't satisfying!

The way the races and powers fit together is fantastic but I don't find the game very satisfying. The hidden scoring is supposed to keep things exciting but I really hate games where you sit around doing math at the end of the match to see who won... It just feels anti climatic. In prefer games to end with a clap of thunder as someone achieves an amazing objective.

easy to pick up. Found the video review found on this site useful as a starter. Very straightforward in understanding.  Very addictive.  Played 2x in one evening on first play - with 3 players.  Want to play more.  3rd play should take an hour - which is handy!  A light game, but challenging!

Played it again 3 days later - this time with 4 players, all bar me who were new to Small World (although Tony was familiar with Vinci).  Took us about 2hours and 20mins to complete -  but we weren't rushing!

Played it again 4 days after that. Just me and Tony.  2 plays.  Worked really well with the 2 of us - faster - an hour & 1.5 hours each play.  Used the Cursed expansion.  Orc Mauraders are awesome!!  Spirit Goblins were useful too 1/2 way through the game, mopping up declining races.....  Love this game!  Tactical challenges - but fast paced!

Check my game plays for this.  I played it at least 7 times in a row.  There is NO other game in my collection that I paid full retail for and then played SEVEN times in a row. So yeah, I'm liking this puppy. It was easily the surprise hit of the year for me.  I was turned off initially by, well, everything about the game: the theme and that it was an area control game.  But halfway through my second game I realized that this scratches my Battlelore itch better than Battlelore does (sorry Richard!).  The first game in a long long time where I can't wait to get my hands on the expansions!

I used to like this game quite a bit, but my most recent play left me less impressed. Quite easy to completely wipe out a player, and if people aren't actively keeping the leader in check (which is hard because points are kept secret) then the game is essentially accidental kingmaking. The theme is surprisingly well integrated though, so if I was more of a theme gamer I'd like it more than I do.

Small World [i]should[/i] be good.  All the clever little parts are there but in the end it just doesn't add up right and the sum is summarily just "some" of the should-be-sum. The issue is that the best strategy is essentially "camp where most profitable to you" but since players build their races to be profitable out of a fixed pool of attributes, it ends up being uncommon for players to be after the same tiles.  And that isn't even to mention that any game that trades on conflict having "camping" as the strategic end doing a great job of aiming down at the closest extremity before pulling the trigger.

Simple to play.  The plethora of different race/ability combos is interesting.  Not much depth, in terms of things to do and manage on one's turn, but some interesting choices to be made.  There is quite a bit of tactics and some strategy, and not much of a luck factor. The rules are simple enough to allow me to play with my 7-year-old (now 8-year-old) son.  


Update: played 4-players with gaming buddies.  More challenge with more players.

Area control games with very simple rules. Strong though superficial theme with nice emergent humour from the random combination of races with powers. Decent and attractive components with several game boards being a bonus. Overly slow gameplay for such simplistic rules and shallow strategic depth. Long downtime while waiting for other players. Not a good entry game for non-gamers, or a good game for casual, filler or party situations because of play and waiting times, and not a good game for experienced gamers because of the time-versus-depth ratio. Low replayability because of simplistic mechanics.

Rather unsatisfying for strategically-oriented players, for witch El Grande might be a better alternative with richer though familiar mechanics and similar session times.

Conçu par Philippe Keyaerts dans la droite ligne du jeu Vinci, primé à plusieurs reprises, Small World plongera les joueurs dans un monde habité par des nains, des mages, des amazones, des géants, des orcs et même des humains. Ces peuples luttent sans merci en envoyant leurs troupes à la conquête de nouvelles régions : les civilisations les plus faibles seront impitoyablement chassées du monde de Small World !

En choisissant la bonne combinaison entre les 14 Peuples et les 20 Pouvoirs Spéciaux au bon moment, les joueurs pourront étendre leur empire, souvent aux dépens de leurs voisins ! Cependant, leur civilisation finira par s'essouffler - il leur faudra alors en choisir une autre pour remporter la victoire.

À vous de choisir le bon Peuple au bon moment et de défendre la grandeur de votre empire face aux ambitions de vos voisins... car le monde est tout petit !

This game is all the fun of Risk only it plays *fast* and the combat options (races and powers) are always fresh.

It's basically a war game with zero tedium. I don't always want to play it (I prefer some negotiation and resource management, maybe alliances, and some luck), but a friend wants a fight, this is it.

RATING: 8
I don't enjoy war games, as I feel the long-term planning is too tedious, especially when the dice play such a crucial role in determining the victor.  Having said that, Small World isn't a war game at all, despite the fact that it hides underneath a war-gaming theme.  There's virtually no combat between players, and the game is all about choosing the right combination of power and race, using that race to its fullest potential, and then abandoning it for a new one.  I like the idea of having to switch to a new race once the current one is stretched too thin, as this unique mechanic really separates this game from most other games I've played.  After two plays, I'm definitely liking Small World, although I'm worried that its entertainment value will fade with time.  This one hasn't hit the table in a while, and it frequently seems like there are other games we'd rather play.

RATING: 3
Pretty chaotic strategy/ light wargame with a captivating map. Or more accurately, maps, since there are three total included, scaled to the number of players. Best with three or four players, I reckon, though can be played with 2-5. This one starts to get fun after a few playings, and people start to understand the mix and match combos. But it starts to get tedious pretty quickly after that. I will add that this game is beautiful. Days of Wonder did it up right.  I wish there was a little more depth to the combat, or to the game as a whole, but the simplicity is a plus in many circles. Not very good as a 2 player game since whoever gets the most unbalanced combo first has a big advantage. The iPad version is a lot more fun for me, as many of these simple games tend to be. Removes all the setup and upkeep.

Edit: I have been playing this quite a bit recently on the iPad again, and I am reminded about an almost unbelievably annoying part of this game: the die rolls. Normally die rolls don't bother me at all (I am a long time wargamer, after all), but here they just swing the game too much. They are annoying in this game in the same way the die rolls are annoying in Summoner Wars.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The main conceit in this game - that a race will only be used for two or three turns - means that you don't have any emotional investment in your armies.  To me that defeats the purpose of a "Risk-like" game of conquering as much as possible.

It's fairly quick, and inoffensive, but not a game I'm particularly eager to play again.

I can really appreciate this as a clever, fun, well-designed area control game.  The various factions and powers coupled with the simple rules makes this a great gateway game.  However, it's just not really my thing for some reason.  I find the decision of when to decline stressful rather than enjoyable and while I would recommend this as an excellent alternative to Risk, it's just not quite for me.

I enjoy the different race/power combinations and picking the best ones.  I find the actual gameplay to be a bit dull (put 3 chits here, 2 chits there, etc.).  There's fun to be had with the political interactions among players but you can definitely fall victim to tag-teaming if people aren't paying attention to who the real leader is.

Days of Wonder has quite an array of good games and this is definitely on the list.  Area control and Combat are not my favorite mechanics and that is all this game is, but being able to discard a race and start a new makes it less detrimental to lose a fight or two. Really enjoy this game.

RATING: 5
Ooooh, saving myself some time, copying from my comments on Underworld. 

This one is more interesting than I thought it would be on the surface - I somehow thought it would be more Risk-like in play, but the deterministic combat and the way the race+abilities work makes it feel more like a puzzle. Calculating your maximum score for any given turn is one thing, but the focal point of the game is in timing your decline correctly, and considering your choice of race as they are far from equal. Also, the way the powers on the board work can change things up a bit (making things less straight forward).

The downside is that ultimately, if you are the one that gets the least beat on - you'll probably win, but that is more of a player issue (though the hidden scoring makes it easier for a player to mistake another for the leader - If you track so it isn't much of an issue, but that won't always be the case (though if that isn't the case then open scores most likely wouldn't change things either based on my experience)).

Enjoyable, goes by quick and you get to feel clever when you perfectly time your decline so you not only get to steal the perfect race from someone else, but also then use it to force an unwanted decline for another player. The idea of harassing the active rather than the declined race is something people quickly grasp (forcing them into decline to be able to do anything, which will wipe the current race in decline off the board as well).

A good game, this one has the clearer map than the underworld one, and expansions that fit it better, so it might get the nod if you plan to expand on it - but from what I gather Underworld has a bit more interesting races and artifacts/locations that add some more stuff to the game which might give it the nod if just comparing base games.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Use different races with their own special powers to outnumber the masses across a board and score points for territories controlled. Spread too thin? Grab another race and run over those in decline.

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: Quick to learn, relatively light, loads of variety in the races and special power combination's, but mostly it's just balls to the wall fun. There's no holding back in this game you just cream people as far as you can, then rest until the next chance to do it again. There's almost no incentive to hold back since you can always start a new race and use that to cover more territory. It's nice to see a combative game not so reliant on luck and the bit there is is a nice edge. The artwork is beautiful, theme well implemented, and having four completely different boards for the different numbers of people playing is a great touch.

Cons: The game play, as you probably can already tell, is pretty straightforward. There's only a few real meaningful decisions to make: What race to choose, where to enter the board, and what time to go into decline. Everything else will simply play itself out if you let it. I haven't played a two-player game, but I can't imagine how it would be worth playing as such.

Other: The amount of confrontation needs to be considered with some players; it's either going to be a big plus or a big minus. All the negatives I've mentioned are non-existent to me because I just love the positives so much more, but I mention them as potential downfalls that others might find stand in the way of their own enjoyment. 

Best Use: 3-5 people who want a fast, confrontational game and don't want to hold back.

I didn't pay much attention to Smallworld when it first came out because I typically avoid games that are too confrontational or aggressive. I'm loving the game since my first few games recently! It's a quick, light game so it doesn't feel too aggressive, and the diversity of powers makes the game interesting - I want to try more and more combinations!

RATING: N/A
Not too sure about the quick turnaround of the races, no way to strategize really, and somewhat random and chaotic. So I would say it is probably too hectic for the weight of the game in my opinion.

Risk style game with fantasy theme and special powers. What's not to like? Real solid game, though a few combinations, while rare to get, do seem overly powerful when they do occur.

I held back on buying this for some time, since it is essentially a civ game with combat only.  What could be the point?  But it retains a certain charm.  Maybe we are too susceptible to special powers and cute art.

RATING: 8
A re-themed Vinci (which I like). Very nice components, and the fantasy theme that is thick as Vegemite.

The game is quick to learn and has tons of replayability, even without the myriad of expansions. 

It has surprising strategic depth, especially when playing with thinkers. 

What makes this game especially fun (aside from the artwork, theme, mechanics, and so on) is that is plays according to the group - if you have a fun, roleplaying type of group, it lends itself to that. As mentioned above,  if you have serious strategic gamers, it has enough depth and options to give you a challenge, especially when it comes to planning where to reinforce, who to be diplomatic with, and when to put a race into decline. With reckless players, or new players, you can experiment and simply enjoy yourself. It handles 2 players well, all the way to 6, and with the Reams expansion has modular boards and scenarios...

For the money, it's an "efficiency must" for any collection.

I bought this game when I was starting my collection, had never played it before or seen it being played. I picked it up for the fantasy aspect, the colourfulness and I have absolutely not regretted it.

There is so much replayablity in the base game alone with how all the special powers can be mixed with any race. The mechanics are simple to teach, simple to understand. It's also a ton of fun.

This one will be played for years to come.  Wish I could play it more; the problem is that it seems so easy and non-gamers like it, but there is real strategy here, so I tend to dominate unless I really hold back.  All the gamer types I know seem to be burned out on this one and don't want to play.  Seems I'm always behind in the gaming hobby... which is probably a good thing actually ;-)

RATING: 5
A reasonably entertaining Euro, with all of the usual caveats. It's pretty with some nice mechanics and seems to be well balanced. The random pairings of race and special talent works well and is alternately interesting and amusing. Combat is highly abstracted, and as usual it's all about play balance rather than anything that resembles real combat. Still, it's reasonably enjoyable, in no small part due to the fact that it's a very acceptable length. I gave it a 6 immediately after a first play, but with some time to reflect, I'm going down to a 5. It's in the upper 5 range, higher than most other games of its type that I've played, but still with all the flaws and aritificialities that annoy me. I'd rather play this than, say, Age of Empires III. But I'd rather not play either.

Rather than being annoyed, I find it amusing that it keeps getting nominated as a wargame for the Golden Geeks. Squint how you may, this is not a wargame. Anyone who calls this a wargame is a person whose judgment is not to be trusted in important manners. This is a wargame the way beef is a vegetable. But so it goes. The admins have made it clear that they don't care, so we might as well point and laugh.

The game's mechanics are solid, and the variable powers part of the game is cool. Backing a race and watching it rise and fall is very solid. Loads of people I've played it with enjoy it. I just can't seem to grasp the game strategically. Read strategy articles, spent serious time thinking about it, I just don't *get* it. That said, I would recommend it for other people to play without me. (After 30 plays)

Pretty cute Eurogame, in some ways an upgrade on Vinci.  the variable powers seemed to work well with nothing overwhelming.

Fun area control game where players control races with different powers (each race comes with a power and then an extra power is assigned to the race).  Races are drafted and then players take a turn placing their characters onto the board to conquer territories.  The battle system is very quick, straight-forward and with just enough luck to keep it exciting without getting out of hand.  Since there are numerous power combinations and because it's a fast-playing game it's highly replayable.

American-style to the core, but offers sporadic fun to this Eurogamer.  Take control of a fantasy "race" and start placing your control markers on the board from outside-in; on subsequent turns you expand inwards.  The more spaces you control, the more resources you get.  When you get tired of a race (or use it up...), transfer to a different one.  Races have different powers, and the a/b combination of powers probably makes for interesting replayability.  Tactical considerations are helpful, in terms of how you play up your race's abilities in order to gain resources (coins).

Recieved in Math Trade. Was initially put off due to some reviews I had read, but ultimately glad I went this route.

very unique gameplay from anything else I've played or have in my collection.

The humor and theme i feel saved some of its other downfalls.

I honestly believe there are some serious balance issues which reflect in the score I've given it, but nothing that can't be over-looked over for a good time with friends and/or family.

several plays in the first week and my initial take that this might now be my first choice for newer/novice gamers that do not have much exposure to designer themes.  i loathe ticket to ride and never really got settlers to click for me.  give me vegas showdown or potentially this.

seems to scale easily 3-5 players, but 3 or 4 player might be the best.  jury is still out on the 2 player version.

Small World is a unique game that brings "war game" and actually makes it fun and accessible to everyone. I have to say that I got this game not expecting to love it as much as I do. What I love about it is that the theme, artwork, and premise bring a certain levity to an otherwise combative genre (area control/wargame). My wife loves it, my gamer buddies love it. The game just has that universal appeal. Great production, and plays well with 2 all the way up to 5. Keep it light, laugh as your berserking hobbits run amok, just to beat down by some commando Kobolds! This is a game where whoever redesigned the game to appeal to a bigger audience hit the nail right on the head. Very deserving of 2009 game of the year.

Despite its friendly presentation and fairly easy rules, don’t be fooled, this is a war game. The race-power combos give the game a huge variety, offering different situations all the time. However, being a war game, you can easily get ganked and griefed, so politics matter more than your game choices. I kinda mind the last part, but because its duration is very short after a couple games I’m willing to forgive it.

this looks and plays like a euro game spoofing the ameritrash genre. from the cutesy artwork and humour to the streamlined and filtered gameplay, this is an easy to learn and quick playing game focusing on territory and building an economy. it makes vague gestures towards being conflict oriented but it lacks risk and strategy in that aspect of the game. by the end of my play i could sort of see where the game was coming from, which boosts my rating here a bit but overall this is a game that falls between too many stools for me, yet i think it will appeal to a large percentage of the population of this website.

* One of the few games in my collection that went from worst to first
* Game gained new life when the kids fell in love with it (all the expansions soon followed)
* Different combos of races and special powers make for some interesting games

Played it with four people and it worked great. From the initial vibe I got, I feel like playing this 1v1 would be kind of boring, but I'll have to see.  The randomness factor makes for some interesting opportunities as far as the races go.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent re-make of Vinci.  The terrain rules and combat rules are simplified (making the game easier to explain to new players), and the map has much more information on it.  

In this game players choose a race from a set of randomly drawn tiles (which all have special powers) and then take over terrain to score victory points.  The game has combat in it (you can attack other people's provinces), but the combat is simple (and mostly predictable) and easy to resolve.  Players can also go into "decline", meaning that they still score points for their current race, but then get to choose a new one to start up with.  So, even if you get beaten, you can come back again (and knowing when to decline is critical, as you can essentially get double points for a few rounds).

This is a great update of an already-great game.  The simplification of the rules helps, the better map helps (though I wish it were a bit less busy graphically), and the vastly-improved bits make the game much easier to play (since each race now has unique cardboard units, rather than colored cubes).  The victory points are secret (rather than open), which removes the king-maker problem of Vinci, and the game has a set number of turns (which removes the slightly-annoying "if they get 17 points then they'll end the game, but if I do this and this other person does that then they'll only get 15, and the game will go one more turn") reasoning in the original.

All in all this is a great game made even better (though it is now a bit simpler than the original, so some tactical options are lost).  But given that we can now play a 5 player game of this in 1 1/4 hours, I'd say the slightly simplification is worth it.

Although I don't often suggest this one at game nights, but I can honestly say that I've enjoyed every game I've played of Small World. I love the artwork and my friends and I enjoy the races and powers. There appears to be a vocal opposition to this game online, but I don't really understand it. It's not the greatest game ever played, but it is a fun time and I wouldn't refuse it when offered.

RATING: 5
Draft race tiles and conquer territory for most points.

Plays: 1.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Conflict and Competition for scarce resources - races and territories.
Randomness: Low – tile drafting and dice with low impact.

Replayability: Pretty good. Every game will be different depending on the races available in the draft. It's also pretty quick, so why not play again?
Fun: Decent. The art is deliberatly cartoonish and the race-power combos can be somewhat hilarious. The presentation helps a lot to create a fun atmosphere. The actual gameplay isn't very much fun though, the best play is often fairly obvious and deterministic.
Memorability: Low, it’s a VP race that doesn’t create stories. But again, the presentation makes this better than most.

Thematic integration: Weak. The presentation is great in this regard. But it's a reimplementation of the (almost themeless) game Vinci. So we know that the "theme" is completely decoupled from the mechanisms. It's just lipstick on a pig.
Components: Good, the race tiles in particular are done in a distinctive style.

Who will like this: Casual gamers that don't notice the decoupling of theme and mechanisms. It's probably good as a gateway to games with conflict. The cartoonish style makes it hard for anyone to get serious about it.

First and foremost, this is NOT, I repeat NOT a wargame except in only the slimmest sense so please don't introduce it as a wargame. There is no sense of military maneuvers or strategy and no sense of achievements of meaningful objectives so forget it. In fact, if you try and use military strategy its not likely to work.

Having said that, quite simply this is an area control game and it works on that level very well. I like the game and enjoyed playing it as the simplicity and constant change is fun. The tribes and powers are amusing. 

I do wonder if this game works better with an odd number of players and probably 5 which doesn't allow anyone to avoid getting hammered as happened in the 4- player game I played.

Vinci, with a fantasy theme.  I think I have a slight preference for Vinci; the wooden discs are much less fiddly than all those cardboard tokens, and certainly don't need both in my collection.  However, Small World probably has a slight edge in terms of theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The initial appeal of this game was seeing all the race/power combos.  After a while of playing this game, that's maybe lost a little bit (and only a little) of the excitement, but the game has firmly settled into a thoroughly enjoyable mental puzzle on how to be the most efficient with your race/power selection, how to best use them, do I make enemies, and if so, when, how do I time going into decline... lots of great decisions to be made.  I would also argue that the game is enjoyable at all player counts, though quite different.  2p is very much all about conflict, whereas higher player counts keep the player politics flowing.  Love this game all around.

Egyelőre csak Android appban (Small World 2) van meg és a tapasztalatok alapján valószínűleg ez így is marad. Bővebben:

Egyedi mechanizmusú területfoglaló játékról beszélünk, aminek igen egyszerű a szabályrendszere, és inkább taktikai, mint stratégiai játék, viszont rengeteg kombózási lehetőséggel a választott fajnál és képességénél.

A játék vizualitása kiemelkedő, pazarul néz ki, ez mindenképpen növeli az élvezeti értékét.

Próbáltam 2 és 5 fővel is, utóbbival azért jobb, de valahogy nekem nem adja azt a hype-ot, ami övezte anno. Kicsit csalódás emiatt. Jó-jó, de nem az a kiemelkedő játék, simán meglennék nélküle.

Nice, quick territory grabbing game based on 'Vinci'. It has elements of Britannia and 'History of the World' where new nations/ tribes rise and take over land held by older civilisations. The original element is that tribes each have their own attributes which are randomly allied to special powers. This gives each play a different feel as one time you may be playing with Flying Wizards or Wealthy Wizards or Pillaging Wizards etc. The other element of the game is picking the right time to have your current race go into decline before taking control of a new one. Overall - enjoyable and easy to learn - kids will pick it up easily and enjoy the slightly silly tribe types.

RATING: 6
First play was fun but frustrating--I did the worst in our game, and knew I was doing poorly, but really felt like I had no recourse or method of improving my situation. Our game had a massive runaway leader problem, linked, I would imagine, to the same flaw that kept me kissing the boots of the other players. We had some rules disagreements that could not be resolved by referencing the ambiguously worded rulebook, and honestly, some of those powers are just too damn powerful.

That said, the game is beautifully produced, there was lots of interaction, and we definitely had fun playing it. I won't say no to a future game, and might even revise my rating - maybe this game, like Cosmic Encounter, is about the fun in spite of the flaws.

------------------------------------

Picked up in trade, along with leaders expansion. You know after some time away, this IS a good game. Not a great one, but we all have fun, and what else is there, you know?

Begins to feel rote and uninspired after repeat plays.

I liked it better than Vinci.  The fantasy theme probably had a lot to do with that.

Like Vinci it sits in some nebulous space of being a euro spreedsheet and a conquest game.  I keep wanting to fight a war, but the game keeps forcing me to make moves based on scoring arbitrary victory points.  You can get far by sweet talking other players, but it doesn't have any diplomacy mechanics to handle this dynamic.

Everybody knows your best move choice(s) during your turn, no surprises makes a bit of a dull game. The good choices are extremely obvious and painful when you watch the 1 players grab them, forcing you to spend vp to skip over crud. Ganging up easily occurs without your opponents meaning to, just wrong place wrong time. Once you have been knocked around enough it becomes impossible to recover and you know it thoughout the remainder of the game. My painful experiences come from 4 to 5 player games. 1 on 1 is probably best way to play.

There is no other game I have ever seen that provides the feel of a large-scale conquest game with such quick plays and such fun theme. I have taken my rating down a couple of notches because, with repeated plays, the game becomes a bit predictable. There is not much incentive for taking the more "interesting" race/power combos; victory point bonuses are too good. And generally whomever declines their races the quickest wins.

This is one of the first games I bought after deciding to move beyond the gateway games of TTR and Catan. It appeared as though it had great depth and replayability. Unfortunately, after repeated plays, I found the game play too shallow to keep my attention. There's simply not enough significant choices to make per game. Each turn you either spread out to get the most points possible, and its generally fairly obvious where those spaces are, or go into decline. Adding the expansions didn't help, the game simply doesn't appeal to me.

Small World is a fun quick game.  Some of the most fun I have  playing a civilization game is choosing a race by special powers, it's fun to see a game that lets you do that over and over again.  But I worry that Small World will lose its appeal over time.  There doesn’t seem to be too much variety if you repeat games, and of course there is somewhat of a king maker element, but it is hard to avoid the king maker element in competing civilization game. All in all I was very impressed, and hope to play it more in the future.  Great game!

Despite my low score on this game, it really is a keeper.  The only reason I don't rate it higher, is the MoIBPS (Millions of Itty-Bitty Pieces Syndrome).  This is tempered by an extremely well designed box, and storage containers.

This is a lot of fun, especially with more than 2-3 players.  4 -5 players make the gameplay more fun, and the competition much more difficult.

in Smallworld geben sich die Spieler ordentlich auf die Omme, denn Jeder möchte gerne die meisten Gebiete, in dem kleinen Fantasyreich, für sich beanspruchen. Das bedeutet also, dass Smallworld ein reinrassiges Area Control Spiel ist, allerdings mit einem ziemlich collen Kniff: Die Rassen in Smallworld sind erstmal typisches Fantasyklischee. Da gibt es Elfen, Zwerge, Hobbits, Skelette, Riesen, Menschen, Wassermänner und noch einige mehr. Jedes Volk hat dabei eine einzigartige Fähigkeit. Die Orks z.B. sind ein sehr kriegerisches Volk und erhalten zusätzliche Siegpunkte, wenn sie Gebiete erobern, in denen sich bereits ein anderes Volk ausgebreitet hat. Aber diese Fähigkeiten machen Smallwordl noch nicht so besonders. Zusätzlich gibt es nämlich noch weitere Fähigkeiten, die durch modulare Pappteile, immer wieder neu und unterschiedlich, den einzelnen Völkern zugeordnet werden. Dann kann es in einem Spiel Smallworld z.B. Fliegende Skelette oder Heldenhafte Ghoule geben. Alles ist möglich und somit spielt sich jede Partie Smallwordl anders. Das täuscht ein bisschen darüber hinweg, dass die grundlegenden Mechaniken in Smallworld eher einfach sind. Unter´m Strich bleibt ein gutes und spaßiges Area-Control Spiel.

A great, fun game of friendly conquest and world domination if such a thing is possible. Scales well from 2 to 5 players (there's a different board depending on number of players), though possibly not quite as good with 2 players.

Great area control game.  The various races and different power combinations provide fantastic replayability.  Rules are straightforward and easy to grasp (though non-gamers may require help on their first playthrough).  Lots of conflict and it looks great.

A "Risk" style territory conquest game with a twist.
There is a variety of races all with unique attributes coupled with a special skill, which you must use to wisely gain as much territory (and hence victory coins).
Eventually you'll run out of units and will have to choose a new race/skill matchup and with that you'll have to change tactics too.

The races and powers are unique on their own, and the randomness of their assignment makes the game endlessly replayable. Super simple rules, but not devoid of strategy. MUST be played with 3 or 4 players. 2 players, you don't get the full effect. 5 or more, too long and tedious.

RATING: 6
Tighter, quicker and probably more accessible version of Vinci although some of that games good features were lost in translation (eg maintaining cohesion, not being able to have a declined and a new empire together, some of the terrain combat bonuses). The shorter length is the main improvement over Vinci, though, so its more likely to get played by those who need to play three games inside 4 hours. I suppose the theme is cute but I'm a bit over kiddy fantasy motifs. The hidden scores don't stop seem to stop leader bashing so the scores may as well be displayed on a track. Like Vinci, the combinations of powers and races will help this game's replayability. Despite my minor quibbles I'd happily play either Small World or Vinci.

Update: Small World is a bit too repetitive and oversimple and plays to long for what it is. Not a bad game but a bit dull.

We loved the heck out of this game when we first got it ... played it almost every day over Christmas holidays 2012.

RATING: 4.5
Decisions felt uninteresting in this one. It was simply a matter of deciding the best (and yes, there is a best) available generated race to populate the board. Players attacking each other are simply disqualifying themselves from the race by reducing their own pieces. After multiple plays, I haven't found a single coherent strategy. Without a proper storage solution, the fiddlyness can be a nightmare.

Крепкий середнячок. Полуабстрактный варгейм-контроль территорий. Идея довольно интересная: править нацией несколько ходов, потом бросить её и взять другую.
Основное, над чем надо думать — это какую расу взять, и когда ей прийти в упадок. Тактическое управление юнитами играет второстепенную роль, и иногда совсем очевидно, как ими "ходить". Союзы (а следовательно, общение) с другими игроками здесь редки, так как при развитии расы просто высчитывается максимальная выгода, а кого при этом приходится гасить — вторично.
Короче, от "варгейма" здесь осталось мало чего. Это следует иметь в виду, при выборе данной настолки.

One of those games that no one I know seems to like but me. The game is simple, but I love all the different powers and how they interact. Admittedly, many of them are difficult to remember and need to be looked up, which makes the game fiddly. At this point though, I think I'd rather just play a Commands and Colors game or Dominant Species, depending on the number of players. Small World is still fun, but like many Days of Wonder games, it tends to fade with age.

RATING: 8
Nice fantasy artwork, but if that's not your thing, then don;t let it put you off, because it is a bit of a paste on.

The game itself is a smart area control / kinda action point affair with a clever 'issue' arising in that you will soon stretch your army/race thin and need to re-invent yourself with a new army/race.  The decisions about tipping points and the selection of new skills each time are what make this.

It's very good.

I want to love this game, it's one of those games I describe to others as "Like Risk but Good". The problem I have with it is getting others to play. The people I'm trying to systematically indoctrinate into gaming culture don't like it, and the hard-core gamers I hang out with got bored of it really quickly, even with all of the expansions. I can't put my finger on what it is about the game that turns people off, but it's there for sure.

I must be missing something. Small World is popular but all you do is adding tokens to a board and removing tokens where you have a majority. This also encourages players to attack the weaker ones, giving the game a runaway leader problem. I guess the different tribes with different skills are supposed to add variation but to me it's just frustrating not knowing the game conditions in advance.

Edit 2015-06-22: Finalement, je me décide à essayer de vendre pour la première fois des jeux (une quinzaine). C'est le premier à être parti!

Décembre 2013: 8.2
Mars 2013: 7.7
Février 2014: 7.3

Une seule partie depuis mars 2013 et on dirait que le coeur y était et y est un peu moins pour ce jeu...

**

À mon avis, on ne peut pas considérer Small World comme étant un jeu "familial". Dernièrement, une dame s'est plaint à un commis d'un magasin de jeux de société de la complexité du jeu. Ce dernier répondit "pourtant, c'est un jeu assez simple", ce qui a probablement contribué à ce que la dame se trouve vraiment bête!

1) Les règles prennent plusieurs pages et ne peuvent être expliquées en moins de 10 minutes. Il en faut peut-être même une quinzaine...

2) C'est un jeu de conquête, d'attaque des autres joueurs. Ce n'est pas usuel chez le joueur occasionnel;

3) Outre la longueur de la règle, l'aide-mémoire est lui-même complexe! Grand carton (que l'on ne sait pas trop où poser sur la table étant donné que le jeu lui-même prend beaucoup d'espace) recto-verso. Un aide-mémoire aussi gros illustre la pluralité des règles du jeu.

4) Outre la longueur de la règle, il y a dès le départ six combinaisons de deux pouvoirs à assimiler. À cela s'ajoutent d'autres règles (combinaisons) au fur et à mesure que le jeu avance. Il s'agit, après avoir choisi une tribu, d'expliquer quelle nouvelle tribu devient disponible, ainsi que sa caractéristique. À la fin d'une partie, le nouveau joueur n'a probablement pas vu - encore moins expérimenté plusieurs tribus et combinaisons;

5) Outre l'aspect "attaque" qui n'est pas commun à tous joueurs, le concept de "déclin" et le timing pour l'exécuter n'est pas très tangible. Ne rendons-nous pas vulnérables les cases que l'on contrôle en perdant un tour complet pour passer en déclin?

6) Il y a une multitude de façons de gagner des points et des parties. Le contrôle de territoire par la tribu active, ainsi que celle en déclin, certaines cases donnant des bonus à certaines tribus, les points bonus des tribus rejetées par d'autres joueurs, etc.

7) La fin d'un tour permet au joueur de bien se repositionner défensivement, ce qui n'est pas automatique chez le joueur occasionnel;

8) Une grande quantité de matériel (de petite taille) et de détails sur la carte. Les pièces de tribus sont empilées afin de laisser visibles certaines informations de cases (les mines, par exemple), et la valeur défensive de chaque endroit se calcule par le nombre de pièces de carton sur cette case, ce qui n'est pas toujours visible au premier coup d'oeil;

9) La visibilité peut aussi poser problème concernant toutes les tuiles en déclin, qui se ressemblent les unes des autres, ainsi que le contour des cases variable d'une à l'autre - tout à fait différent d'un plateau quadrillé du style "échiquier".

10) Un grand nombre de choix d'attaques à chaque tour;

11) Ce qui motive chaque décision repose sur deux critères, forts différents l'un de l'autre: A) les bénéfices à court terme et à moyen terme, c'est-à-dire les points à récolter dans l'immédiat et plus tard dans le jeu, en fonction des forces et faiblesses de chaque camp. Ceci n'est pas simple à évaluer; B) le score actuel de chaque joueur, afin de travailler à obtenir des points aux dépends du meneur. Hors, les points étant cachés, il n'est pas si simple d'être certain de qui doit être la cible d'attaques;

12) Le bien-fondé d'une décision s'évalue selon son résultat. Hors, le résultat de toutes décisions dépend en partie de comment les adversaires réagissent. On peut prendre objectivement (avec l'expérience) une bonne décision mais le résultat peut être catastrophique si, par exemple, plusieurs adversaires nous attaquent simultanément suite à cette "bonne" décision prise. Il est donc long et difficile de se faire une expertise juste du jeu.

13) On peut terminer une partie de Small World en étant un peu fâché contre certaines décisions d'adversaires, qui parfois, nous attaquent "à tord" et laissent en paix les joueurs pourtant en avance dans les points ("king making").

Bref, je classe ce jeu comme ayant une difficulté "Medium", et je désapprouve qu'il soit classifié "familial". J'ai réussi à expliquer et à jouer une partie complète de mon jeu préféré, Tigris & Euphrates, avec mes parents, deux joueurs très, très, très occasionnels. Je n'ai pas réussi avec Small World! Certes, T&E est plus complexe. N'empêche, Small World n'a rien d'un jeu si simple lors des deux, trois premières parties...

La seconde partie m'a plus convaincue. Des mélanges races/pouvoirs amusants et équilibrés. Simple à jouer et plateaux adaptés en fonction du nombre de joueurs. Essentiels de l'avoir en francais pour une meilleure lecture des pouvoirs

RATING: 6
The interaction between the races and abilities are about the most interesting part in the game. Other than that, the game takes a bit long, and there isn't a great deal of decisions you need to make every turn - other than speculating who's the leader and kingmaking. It's not a bad game and I can see the appeal, just not for me.

Is it "the best" board game ever? No, of course not. But it's a perfect execution of what it is.

I will never turn down an opportunity to play Small World, particularly with the expansions thrown in.

Fantastic game. Love how it's played out. The luck factor evens out over multiple playes, and the only luck is what races are available to you when its your turn.
(And perhaps if a bad player makes a silly move or a player decides you're in the lead and attacks you, even if there are better targets)

Great experience and fun theme

I like it. Maybe not as much as I first liked it, but I still want to play some more. ... As I play more, the strategic decisions seem, if not totally clear cut, not deep enough to warrant the time to play, at least with 4-5 players. (Although my record is pretty bad, so that sounds stupid and arrogant.) I am consistently horrible at keeping track of the leader.

Although I think it's a decent game, I'm missing some excitement here. Tends to be a little boring without the expansions (really needs "Tales and Legends").

In this reworked version of Vinci, which came out in 1999, players choose a combination of race (e,g, elves, dwarves, amazons, trolls, etc) and ability. One then attempts to take over territories and fight other races, and then one can decide to put their race in decline, and pick a new race.

I think it is better than Vinci. I like how there is a different map for the number of players. The powers and combinations are unbalanced, and a lot depends on if your opponents attack you. That said, it's a fun game, just don't try to take it too seriously.

Mechanically a very straightforward game - you have one active race which invades its way across the land until too thinly spread to expand further, at which point they go into decline and you start with a new race.
The difficulty is that each race and power combo tweaks the fundamental rules, making each combo a unique ruleset in its own right.  Even a shortlist of 6 available combos still means 6 unique sets of rules to grasp before starting a new game.
Plenty of fun once the game is actually under way.

Decent, deterministic area majority/control game. The race abilities, while neat, do feel a little unthematic sometimes (EX: giant vs dwarf is a relatively even fight on normal ground) and the game is very simple, without much meat. There's some negotiation and such, but it didn't get me crazy about it, even though I did like the theme. Played at multiple player counts and still feel the same - meh ish game, not bad not great either.

This is a fun game. Area control based on how far you can spread your chosen fantasy race. Do you stack up in a few areas to stay defensive or spread out and risk being overrun? Then decide when your people have reached their limit and put then into decline, picking a new race for world domination!

As a longtime Vinci lover, I can't help but focus on the differences between this game and the one that inspired it.  I really dislike the reinforcement die, which adds an extra and significant luck element to the game, and I'm also not a fan of the fixed number of turns as opposed to Vinci's "magic number" endgame condition.  The scaled maps are a welcome change, though, and ultimately, it's a fine game on its own.  I'll play this almost anytime, but there's no way I'm trading away my copy of the superior Vinci, and I don't feel any compulsion to own both games.

RATING: 9
Am AMAZING update/remake of Vinci. I like nearly every change that was made (though having cool minis for each race would have been awesome... but I wouldn't want to spend $100 for the game so I understand!). My only issue - and this is based on a single play so take it with a grain of salt - is that the 5-player game seems one round too short. Another round would allow for the chance to decline two or three times rather than just once or twice. It's easy to fix if this turns out to be the case and is probably a matter of taste more than anything, so I can't even call this a flaw - just a preference. If you like Vinci, this is a must play, if not a must buy. If you didn't like Vinci, this may change your mind as it makes some much-needed improvements and the theme feels right and just makes sense.


***UPDATE*** While I still enjoy the game and probably always will, a few things have crept in after multiple plays that bug me (and these would apply to Vinci, as well). I like the hidden scoring, but the politics become a HUGE factor. Instead of just simply bashing the leader (which I also hate - the leader in points may not be in the position to maintain that lead and bashing him over the 2nd or 3rd place player is often a bad move), there's a constant, "Well so-and-so scored 10 points that one round so you need to attack him" or "I just scored 4 points so leave me alone." Hard feelings and bitching and moaning are WAY too prevalent and you really need to be careful about who you play this with because of this. I also feel that the last player has a HUGE disadvantage. Once you do your turn in the last round, you are golden... nobody can affect your score. So, given the choice of attacking a player whom you can't affect or taking points away from someone that hasn't gone yet, who do you think gets screwed? I really think a mechanism needs to be in place - maybe give each player a starting total of additional VPs based on turn order, i.e. start player gets 0, 2nd gets 1, etc.

I think the illustration work for this game is great.  The variance of the special powers and the races are really unique, which will create replayability.

Small World distils the core essence of area control strategy games with an elegant and fast-paced set of rules, and then throws it all into chaos with a set of randomized combinatorial faction powers. The result is something like "fixed RISK" – quick, light, and fun, but not necessarily as strategically deep as other games in the genre.  

Approved.

Normally not a style of game I get into, I DO like the fantasy element and the randomized tribes with equally randomized special abilities. This gives great replay value to the game and makes each new session different.

I am not a huge fan of hiding victory points OR progress on game-ending goals, but that aside, it's a fun game with nice components. I am looking forward to playing the expansions which add more races/tribes, special abilities and even smaller worlds to take over!

Note: My copy of Small World, bought new and sealed, came with a plastic insert for components that did not match what the instruction manual featured. I had to ditch it and place all one million tokens (haha) into individual baggies.

I just love this game. The premise is so simple.  Take lands, get coin.  Win with most coins after the pre-determined number of turns.  But each race and special power that you play with adds some unique modifier. And the powers are paired with races, randomly, every game.  One game a certain race may have dominated when in the next game it's useless.  Once you spread your race thin, get another one!  It's so awesome and with all the expansions and special scenarios and even being able to make up your own races and powers if you want, just make the possibilities endless.

It is also great how many races and abilities are right out of the box.

Want to like this game, but... I simply don't get it. It's just a lot of shifting and piling of tiles. Use whatever tiles you have, no matter where they are placed right now. And if you overspend the right amount you get the opportunity to take yet another territory. I lack something. "Can you find where these tiles go?"

The core mechanic is so simple that the game should be boring, but the combination of random races and random powers add a lot of variation. You got Flying Orcs? I'll counter that with Spirit Trolls. Finding the right combination at the right moment is challenging, but really rewarding if you get it right.
Eventually your amazing race will go into decline and fade away. This, unfourtunately is handled by skipping a turn. Really? Skipping a turn? In 2009?
One more race would've been nice. Powers last an entire game, but races always seem to get recycled...

First play (Vassal), was slightly underwhelming.  I Appreciated the random pairing mechanic of ability/race, but found actual play to be too Euro for my tastes (and mostly my group).

When I was younger I loved to play Risk with my brother and anyone else who had several hours to spare for a game.  Massing an army, conquering territories, and evaluating tactics was a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, Risk games can go on for a terribly long time, and even the mightiest armies can be defeated by unfortunate dice rolls.  I think Small World has a lot of what I love about Risk, but also fixes a lot of the problems too.  Each player takes turns selecting a race / power combination and receives a specific number of armies to enter battle.  On subsequent turns the player can either choose to continue conquering with that combination, or put them in decline so that they can choose a new combination.  The designers did a great job of adjusting the game based on the number of players.  There are different maps and turn counts for each number of players. The variety of races and powers are interesting and well balanced.  There are so many combinations that the game has quite a lot of replay value.

RATING: 6
In most area control games players' starting locations decide where their base of operations will remain for the rest of the game. In Small World players get the opportunity, in fact are compelled, to enter the board in new positions 2-3 times per game. This freshens the calcified territorial battling that occurs in other area control games and gives the game an almost generational feel.

The number of possible adjective-noun combinations of the  abilities and races makes every game different. The inclusion of multiple game boards, one for each number of players from 2-5, allows the game to scale well, although 5-player games tend to drag on.

The lush colors and humorous, cartoon-like art make the game is a visual treat.

Decided to cull Small World from my collection as I felt Blood Rage had similar mechanisms, but surpassed it in theme and execution.

Yes, I am a sucker for beautiful bits and fantasy-themed games, which this has both of.  This is also easily taught and the plethora of race/special ability combos is dizzying, making subsequent plays always fresh and interesting.

At the heart of the game you essentially are taking your tokens and conquering areas on the board by adding +2 tokens to whatever is on the area.  Blank area = 2 tokens to conquer, one enemy = 3 tokens to conquer, and so on.  Every turn you acquire a point for every area you conquer.

The great part of this game is that you choose a race and a special ability during the game that will give you bonuses for different areas to conquer, and different abilities to help you conquer them.

After many plays of this it has cooled off quite a bit.  I still enjoy it, but it is not jumping onto the table again for a bit.

It's a sequel.  As an equal, can I get this through to you?  BGG hype-train of 2008, played in the middle of 2009.  Results?  A resounding 'meh'... but a "meh" I'll play with the right people.

I can't tell if it was the retheming of the game, or the game engine itself.  But after three games, I'm not finding a lot of deep appeal here.  The skirmishes are pretty straightforward, the numerous combinations aren't as numerous as you'd think, and the game plays predictably.  This game is more or less played out already, and that's a sad ROI on a $50 big box.  Expansions help with replayability in the same way that expansions help Dominion, at $10-15 a pop.  But even then, if you're paying attention to other players, it's obvious who you need to attack and when.

That said, for $10 on the iPad, it's a steal.  Also, I can get this game off the shelf and played with my sweetheart and other casual gamers, which is more than I can say for my copy of Twilight Struggle.

Area control at its most bare-bones. The random pairing of races and special powers is an outstanding design choice, but even so Small World is just too simple, too unadorned. I still enjoy it on occasion with 4 or 5 players, if primarily for the social experience.

has to learn the abilities of the different attributes and all the races. the combinations then offer huge variety. i am not very fond of warlike games like this one with direct confrontation, but this one is short enough and usually there is no feeling that you were attacked for personal reasons.

Small world seems like a conquest style game like Risk etc, but underneath is more of a euro style point optimization game.  Lots of variety in the box so every game plays differently and different maps for player counts.  A well put together package.

Simplistic.  Oh look, you have more units than me you conquer the region... Lame.  I LOVE the idea of deciding when your race goes into decline.  But, this is an incredibly simplistic "intro" type experience.  My fiancé and I tired of it within two plays.  Dull, simple, with some great ideas that beg a more intriguing delivery.

It's Vinci, with modified powers. Some seem too strong, others too weak. Doesn't seem balanced at all.

RATING: 4.5
The theme is cool, the idea is cool, the mechanics are cool, the components are cool... But the game is not.

Whenever you're in the lead, it's very easy for people to gang attack you, and there's NOTHING you can do about it.

Points earned are public, the only solution is not to be on the lead until the end. And just having to play 6-7 turns trying not to score too much seems very stupid to me.

I don't mind playing stupid games from time to time as long as they are fun, but 2 hours seems too long as playing time for one of those.

This doesn't happen on 2 players games. I would give this game an 8-9 as a 2 players game.

RATING: 7
First impression (4 players) :
I think this is more fun than Vinci and definitely better themed. Some race/skill combinations can be nutty good and players that have played several games more should have knowledge advance and sometimes with equally leveled players even pickorder might decide too much (in rare) situations. Fun game and definitely more on skill than luck deciding most games.

I haven't really enjoyed this game yet.  Partly because I suck at it.  Still, it has an interesting combination of fantasy races and entertaining traits that can make the game entertaining at least in discussion and role-playing.  But, it takes way too long to play for what it is and it's a challenge to get a new group going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Clever theme, artwork and the combination of races and powers do well at hiding what could be a very dry,  procedural and abstract game. It's lot lighter and shorter than I expected, but as a result I'm less bothered by the tactical and opportunistic game play, which works in a game that has a very condensed feeling. Small World is a fun, light game. More races and powers are needed to keep this fresh though.

Gioco invitante soprattutto dal punto di vista della grafica e dell'ambientazione. Siamo nel mondo delle fiabe con elfi e orchi, con ratti e scheletri, stregoni e troll, tutti pronti a far crescere la propria influenza in questo piccolo (e affollato) mondo. Il gioco è semplice e veloce, completamente indipendente dalla lingua anche se alcuni simboli non sono immediati. Gode inoltre di una buona longevità grazie al mix di razze e poteri speciali. Inoltre sono già uscite numerose espansioni.

RATING: 8.5
Enormous fun, impressively (and unexpectedly) balanced for all numbers of players, and hits the delicate fine lines between tactical play, luck and long-term strategy. Not only that, but it opens a whole clever world of optimsation tactics while maintaining a beautifully minimal shell. At least, it does if you haven't played Vinci or plenty of wargames.

Further Thoughts - I'm now hooked on expansions...they're only making things better. Brilliant, brilliant lightweight stuff but yet more than just a gateway game.

[2010/01/13]

Played one practice/real game... with 5 plp... all 5 were new to the game... 2 of the people were new to me, and 1 of those 2 new people couldn't figure out the rules all game

i think this game relys on the phrases:"wow, what a cool combo", "let me see what that does" 

the strategy aspect is mostly based on the combinations that you get.... and i swear that my choice of combo was always outdone by the next persons choice.

It also seems like this game relys HEAVILY on opponents trying to figure out who's in the lead and attacking them... I'm not a fan of this game play necessity.. i think it allows some players to play with no regard for who's in the lead, and this can easily make the match-ups uneven skewing the entire competitive nature of the game...

in our game everyone played "for themselves"... and the result was a non-enjoyable game, where at the end, the guy we suspected to win, won... go figure... by the end of turn 4 i was wishing the game was over

could this be fun.... yeah... but i think it would take a really good crowd to make it work... i know that any game can be better if the players all know the rules and have played the game before... but this game needs more than that...


I'll won't refuse to play this...  and it is a "neat" game... but this is a strecth for a "Strategy" game... its more of a  "Strategy-ish" game


recommended for people who like pretty games

Despite the cutesy graphics (which dissuaded me from getting this initially) this is a strong area control game.  After only a few 2-player games I think this will scale well with more players due to different map boards for the different number of players.  And with the race / power combinations I think the game will be replayable for quite some time.

J'ai découvert ce jeu relativement tardivement comparé à sa date de sortie et sa popularité.
J'ai bien aimé le principe et les mécaniques. La rejouabilité est de la partie vu toutes les combinaisons possibles.
Après j'avoue effectivement, comme le précisait l'expert ludique qui m'a fait découvrir ce jeu, qu'il faut avoir un accord de principe de ne pas se rabaisser à jouer purement vengeance car cela gâche complètement tout le jeu.
Toujours sympa à jouer (même en édition Android/Steam sur tablette à plusieurs connectés multi platform) mais pas avec n'importe qui

Neat game. Played it a lot on my Android phone. I like how it allows for direct play confrontation sans the dreaded elimination mechanic. Love the theme. Wish that the board was more modular or there was some sort of global effect that caused one race to be value over another given the current board state. I find myself almost always gravitating towards the same race/power combos as they seem strictly superior.

I really like this game alot.  It has very little luck, though depending on your group it may have some players ganging up on another.  I absolutely love the race and power combinations, and think this is a great game to expand, because the expansions only add to the base game, they don't take anything away.  The biggest downside for me is that the first player has a huge advantage.  They get to pick first, but more importantly, the other players cannot affect the first players score on the final turn.

It's an easy-to-learn (albeit with a few rule vagaries), easy-to-play fantasy battle game with more of a Euro approach to conflict, and certainly a Euro-style scoring system (in which coins rather than dead fantasy race pieces are added to achieve victory). 

I prefer fantasy battle games with more individual combat ratings and conflict (rather than simply awarding territory based on having sufficient pieces to claim unoccupied territory or more pieces than that of an opponent to occupy territory). 

Of course, "Small World" has the usual gorgeous production from Days of Wonder. 

Purchased in November 2010 at 40% off. Purchased expansion, "Be Not Afraid," in December 2010. Sold the base game and "Be Not Afraid" expansion in February of 2011. A good game, but nobody in my family was going to play it, and my personal taste in fantasy conflict games runs more toward war and elimination than bumping opponents' pieces off territories.

A quite fun and simple area control game! There aren't many new gamers you could convince to play Risk! But, this is a great medium weight...and possible gateway game for newcomers! The artwork and design is awesome and humorous! This game is requested to play again and again...therefore it is seeing regular plays! Replay ability is nice, and the game will only benefit from an expansion...looking forward to it! New race variety's and special powers will only make the game more incredibly enjoyable! 2-player games are a little in your face; but, 3to 5 player games are awesome! 

Each player selects a race and connected special power! Bring your stack of race tokens onto the board! Try to win as many territories as you can each turn to win victory points! Decline your race at any time and start a new one! That's it, but so fun!

Played one game, and enjoyed it. However I am a bit dubious about whether it is a bit long for the amount of decision making that goes on. In most cases the placement seemed fairly obvious, as did the decision about when to go into decline, so the only real decision was about which race to pick. I feel like this is not enough to justify the set-up and play length.

除了要想如何進攻，也要思考如何防守
當然運氣還是有點重要的
規則:
1.起始5分 六個種族可選
2.新種族要從邊緣進去，每回合開始就種族可回收任意數量然後繼續佔地，但是必須相連，如果全部回收，就必須重新從邊緣進入
3.衰落秏一回合，且必須輪到你就決定，即使有僵屍也不能使用

RATING: 5
A streamlined version of Vinci. I prefered the Vinci theme to fantasy, though it seems to be doing wonders for their sales. Hidden VP is a bad idea and the game is improved by playing it open. That way you attack the leader, not the perceived leader.

Ultimately (IMO) the gameplay is slow, has a lot of down time, few decisions and is thus boring.

Choosing a new civilisation is mainly a case of estimating the value of each civ on offer (i.e. counting), and each civ is worth almost exactly the same to each player, so there's no real strategic or tactical assymetry or gradients, only counting. 

The icing on the cake is the poor art (hard to pick out the dull greenish-brown counters from the brightly coloured board or from different brownish-green counters) and iconography, the player aids are required though oversized. This uphill battle makes Small World barely worth playing, and certainly a waste of valuable playing time if there are better games available. I didn't care for the 'comedy' artwork.

Don't own it, kind of wish I did but if I did, I don't know when it would come out. I really like the combinations, the theme is accessible/silly fantasy so it doesn't scare off non-nerds, and game play is pretty easy to explain. However, I feel like certain combinations are just devastatingly good. The game also does not make it easy to actually stop a strong leader. It's all pretty hands-off even though, yes, you can directly reinhabit someone's space -- the consequences are just not that awful, since you were probably going to send your civilization into decline eventually anyway.

Great Fun Game! Good combo of cool art, humor, strategy, differentiations, and medium short game play time.  Unlike any game I've ever seen or played.  (I've not yet seen or played Vinci.)  Great as it is, this is NOT a gateway game; too many details to remember/upkeep with so many race and power nuances which can frustrate a new gamer real fast.  BUT, you sure get a lot of great game for your buck.  Did I mention this game is great?  And I'm only talking about the base game, here.

I no longer consider this game a 10 because there always seems to be the need of looking up what the races and powers do, and the rise of questions that come about that are not easily answered without the FAQ sheets.

Okay 2 player. Much better with more players.

What I like:
- Replayability and humor of race/ability combos
- 8 rounds and then it's over

What I don't like:
- I don't like area control or attack-based games
- 2 hours is really too long

It's a clever game, and vastly better than (for example) Risk. There is enough humor, and the attacking feels so impersonal, that I don't hate it. I think it's about weight 2.5 (slightly heavier than BGG voters).

Lovely game. I may have played it a few too many times in too short a space of time. A nice one to bring out with less experienced gamers. Picking a race is a lot of fun. There is a lot of kingmaking potential in this game as VPs are hidden. Losing one region can cost you a helluvalot of points.

A nice area control game, the rules are simple and there's a lot of replayability because of all the races/expansions! Plus the decline mechanic is fun, and adds some strategy to it.

Very nice and fun game. Just the right amount of rules and the hidden scores adds to the strategy as you don't simply chase the leader (as in Vinci). The board is tight, thus you must time yourself as to when to put your civilization into decline and who to fight. Also, you must use your species' powers well.

I have played hundreds of SW games online (Steam) and really enjoy the fast pace fun of the game.  

Unfortunately, at the table, I find the game to be fairly repetitive.  I am surprise how often the same combinations of Race and Powers crop up between games.  Throw in the same players, game after game, and SW versatility diminishes.  

It's a solid game, better when you have a large community of players to draw from.  Better if you get some expansions.

Probably the only "wargame" I can stomach.

I never thought about it as a wargame before someone called it that somewhere else on the geek. The jury's out on whether it really is a war game, at least mine is, but this is one of the few games that I enjoy despite there being an element of outright and direct conflict.

Very fast-paced quasi-wargame that plays very smoothly.  I've soured a little on this game, as it can get repetitive, and doesn't really have the strategic depth that I prefer.  Additionally, I have a slight preference for the game's predecessor, Vinci, despite Small World's superior components: the hidden scoring makes it really difficult to tell what's going on, and the fixed game length removed some of the tension.

Interesting area control/defense game with a pretty good amount of variability between each match. The traits and factions are very easily built upon with expansions to add even more variability. The map is a bit shallow - aside from mountains there are no real distinct features of zones that affects all players. Perhaps an extra-valuable zone in the center of the map would've made a bit more tension in drawing players toward one desirable spot.

The insert is also pretty good - a better storage for the coins would've been nice.

Update: From 8 to 8.5. My oldest daughter loves to play this, and the game is really growing on me as well.

This game works just as good whith 2,3 or 4 players (have not played with 5 yet). 

Bought both "Cursed" and "Great Dames". All of the new races is not really interesting, but some are and with all the new special power badges the expansions brought superior vareity.

Replayability is extremly good. Much more strategic/tactical than I first realized.

Bought it - good family game!

This game is basically a quicker and arguably better version of Risk, (less random chance thanks to minimal die rolling). The game adds a bit of strategy to the standard war game thanks to the option of going "in decline" where you will still earn points for each space you occupy on the board, but they no longer can attack. One of the best things about this game for me personally is it has a TON of expansions. You can get so many more armies and abilities that you can assure yourself you'll never have the same game twice, which I always love. However, attacking other players is usually one of my least favorite aspect of a game, and this game is nothing but attacking. As far as attacking games go though, this is very fun and if you enjoy attacking games, you should check this out.

I have Vinci and now I have Small world as well. I am not so keen on Small world as the board is very very buisy and it is hard to see at a glance who is playing what race.

Very nice!

Rework of a very boring game (even if some very nice ideas were present) that should be used as an example in Successfully Reworking Games class!

Players control civilizations, each with its own unique set of powers, and then go to war to conquer the known world. After their civilization starts to lose steam and conquest becomes hard they can put in decline, pick another one and start over. Conquered regions are worth points and the player with the most points at the end of the 10 rounds is the winner.

The the special powers and the map maneuvering make for very interesting decisions in a relatively short playing time. It's really a fun game to play! 

I only own the iPad version (which is really awesome in every way), so I've only played it 2 player so far.

One could say Days of Wonder games were all style and no substance if they weren't so fun to play... Fortunately, this, Cargo Noir and Pirates Cove are probably my three most popular games with the groups I play with.

The expansions are mostly quite reasonably priced and integrate well, and I can't wait to check out Underground.

RATING: 4
4: After one (or actually half) 2-player play. Components fantastic, everything I read about the game sounded interesting. Casual fantasy war, different armies/races, random abilities, quick and easy gameplay, ability to come back to the board with a new army. Everything sounded so exciting. And then the feeling of actually playing game the itself: boring. Just moving markers on the board. Attacking was all predetermined, not fun at all. No feeling of fighting over the land.

I guess we must've missed something about the strategies, because I just couldn't see much anything worth playing. I didn't see many interesting decisions to be made. Okay, there was the optimization of how to get the best points based on your armys special abilities, but that didn't bring much fun. 

Maybe better with more than two players? I'm I missing something about the game?

A compact game with simple rules. Even though the game is a bit prone to AP (a problem with players like me) I really enjoyed it. The length is ok when played with normal speed. Simple idea, simple gameplay, this game works well.

RATING: 9.1
Excellent. This game has straight forward mechanics, but a ton of depth. There's very little randomness, so all of your decisions are important. Overall, tons of fun.

Once you add all the expansions, the game becomes a bit unbalanced, so cutting some of the best/worst races and abilities from the game could really improve your experience if you have a lot of the expansions. This inequality scales with the number of players. The starting draw is also extremely important and adding some house rules for vetoing might be a good idea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very well designed. Excellent components. Different boards for different number of players a nice touch. Good storage in the box. Scales well to different players, but some abilities more useful with larger number of players (example: diplomat, historian). Longish set-up and clean-up times for a light game. Perfect length.

Fun Factor: 8 (Very fun.)
Components: 9 (Solid, high quality components for the price.  GREAT art direction.) 
Theme: 7 (Kindof wacky.  The abstract fantasy is maybe not the greatest implementation, but it suffices and doesn't detract.)
Mechanics: 9 (The mechanics work for the game.)
Theme + Mechanics: 8
Replay Value: 9 (Vastly replayable.)
Scaling/Players: 10  (Scaling fantastic.  The multiple boards for various numbers of players wins.)

Hard to say, but there is something about this game I love, and something I dislike.  Something tells me that it is nothing more than a disguised math/logic puzzle, which bothers me.  But then the other side of me just thinks that the game works and delivers on its promises to be a perfectly light and fluffy area control game with no frills.  The design delivers in some way, and I can't fault it, but it just doesn't sometimes seem "gamey" enough for me...

(And yet, with every play, I see the simple brilliance of this game more and more.)

Played with 4 and 5. Fun game. Even my wife loved it. Poor readability for declining races though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The light humor of the game belies how much strategy can be found here. Player interaction is incredibly high, and variability is through the roof. Probably best with three or more players as the race combinations are not always balanced and need several players to keep a run-away leader in check.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
My rating is based on a two-player session I played (and won). This feels like a party game above all, there is a portion of strategy to it, but player interaction feels much too restricted. Also, the luck element feels a bit too big. I think that using the dice to help attacks are great, but when you also need to get lucky with your race/ability- combo, that's crossing the line for me.

I'd imagine that adding more players would just mess up player interaction even more since that would make it a game of politics rather than skill of planning.

All in all, this is a game that could be fun over a beer or two, but apart from that, I can't see it's greatness.

Was able to play a few rounds with my wife tonight. We both enjoyed it more than Kingsburg, which is the game we traded for it. Not my favorite game of all time, but it is different, interesting and fun. I am glad we have it.

After 2 more plays I like it even more. There is some definite conflict, but that is not bad. My wife beat me for the first time. We will be playing this again.

Fairy simple "conquer the territory" game with a really terrific theme. Love the way the races and special powers mix and that you can pick multiple characters during the game. Based on our first play, the key seems to be not to hang on too long to your first choice.... or you will be slaughtered. 

Not quite a war game, but has enough of the feel of one for this dedicated eurogamer.

Its always different not only because of differant race/ability constelations but also with different gaming groups. Some are analytical and only do whats best, others retaliate in rage when being attacked.

Chaos, pressure, punking your opponent (without ever really ruining his chances); this my favorite alternative to the Risk-type area control.  I love seeing all the crazy combinations of ability and race that come up, and trying to figure out if I can make it work for me!  But you never feel dragged through the dirt like in Risk, you can always start a new race when things go badly.  Scales great for 2-players.

I got this game on the IOS during memorial day sale for $3. I can tell that it is a well produced game. The game is a gateway game to the area control genre of board games. The game didn't attract me so I didn't buy the physical copy of it since I suspect this game will rate a 7 for me on BGG scale. I am not a fan of area control but this game is pretty fun for just that. I suspect multiplayer of this game will be more fun than a 2p game that's offered on the app.

RATING: 7
I find the potential strategies in this one very attractive as a player, though the first play was full of a lot of rules lawyering and rulebook double checks.  The timing and manipulation of going into decline is still the key element from Vinci, though I wonder whether being the last player (particularly in a 5-player game) might be an obstacle too difficult to overcome.  That, really, looks to be my only long term beef with this game.  I might be wrong, though.  I don't recall this being an issue in Vinci.

Our first five-player was pretty chaotic.  I can see that there is a system to learn and work.  Guess my concern is that there are so many variables (and many so luck-based) that it's hard to invest in a strategy.  Adjustment is one thing, but this was a little extreme....

RATING: 6
To become a great Smallworld player, you would have to analyze and chose your races in relation to the ones already on the board, compare them to those available and the one in use by others. The problem is that doing this slows the game a lot and the advantages are sometimes very minute, too obvious or without any incidence. Players will most likely gun for the most overpowered races and rely on luck for the rest since the differences between races do not have a major impact on the number to territories you can invade. Nice look, easy game for beginners and kids, but not much else. Hugely overrated for the mature gamer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I find the mechanics of the game pretty simple, and that is a very good thing. The trick to get this game right is to pick your races properly and timing when to send a race into decline. I would also argue that a player that knows the races/traits better is at an advantage, so I make a point to illustrate what my opinion is about the available races to new players. I also find this a very good game for people that are interested on board games, but are not ready for really long games. I bought a couple of the minor expansions, and I am considering getting the necromancer expansion, but I think there is really no need to get any of those as the base game has enough to keep everyone busy. All in all, this is not my first choice game when I want to play, but it is almost surely one of the first ones when I am aiming to entertain other people.

The combination of races and powers lends a great deal of variety and keeps things from getting stale. Good art, good production, and lots of humor also help keep it refreshing. Wish it had plastic figures instead of cardboard tokens, but that would be a lot of plastic, and a pretty significant additional cost, so I understand the use of cardboard instead.

This is an improvement over Vinci. Down time is reduced, playing time is reduced, bash the leader is less of a focus, variable powers of the races are easier to absorb, production quality is higher.

Where Vinci was tedious and repetitive, Small World is light-hearted, fast, and fun.

Small World is to Vinci what Risk Godstorm is to Risk 2210.  Vinci and 2210 are fairly well balanced and have a more serious approach. Small World and Godstorm, while employing similar systems to their parent, have far more chaos and wildly different powers. Radical alterations of the board from turn to turn vrs the attrition-like approach. Both are good games (Small World and Godstorm) but not the same level as their respective parents. 

Small World is the beer and pretzels version of Vinci. And the more beer, the better the game.

In many ways the chaos that permeates the game reminds me of Cosmic Encounter. I enjoy playing these types of games but they are not for a serious gamer.

After playing this game 4 times I find myself enjoying it every time. Beautiful components, especially the gameboards. The random race-power combinations help keep every game fresh, Easy to learn, it plays pretty quickly and scales very well from 2-5 players. Sure the 2 player game lacks the multiplayer strategies of the 5 player game, but it's still quite enjoyable. With the combination of being beautiful, easy to learn, and supporting a wide number of players, I can see this game becoming a perrenial favorite of my friends.

Area Control, Variable player powers. Really enjoy puzzling out how use the mix and match powers (Adj + Faction); wish more games used the mixing powers. Does area control really well, but there is going to be a fair amount of elbowing and direct attacking of your opponents; while thematic, can be a bit too confrontational or piling on against one player.

Area control game where you lay tiles instead of mobile troops. Funny, and cute. Very low stress for an area control game. 
In essence, you have a randomly paired race and special power which determines both your abilities and the number of tokens you get. You place the tokens on the board regions as effectively as you can and then hope nobody attacks your position. If you are attacked, you might chose to swap to a new race, if not you might chose to sit, or try to take more areas with what you have left.

The key to the game is knowing when to let go, but truthfully there are few hard decisions to make from turn to turn.

Hunting for the race tokens in the insert and looking up the abilities in the booklets can get tiresome.

RATING: 6
Small World is a somewhat entertaining Euro-style wargame/area control hybrid with a novel theme and interesting character/skill permutations.  All of that stuff sounds great to most gamers...but for some reason it just doesn't click with me.  It isn't that the game isn't fun, it's that it isn't ENOUGH fun.  Some of the classes are monstrously overpowered (Sorcerers, I'm looking at you), and screw-your-neighbor is absolutely essential to win the game.  
This much conflict starts to feel personal for a lot of players.  Me?  I don't mind being targeted, but there is no way to develop a different strategy when you have to keep your current race active for two more turns and then lose an entire turn when you go into decline...I just don't understand why modern designers would put such a dated mechanic in the game.  With AP players and some bad timing, you can literally sit and watch other people play for twenty minutes before the turn where you can actually do something comes around.  
All that aside, the game is popular.  But so what?  It doesn't make it good. Meh for me.

Always have a soft spot in my heart for Smallworld, which was my true gateway game. I think would enjoy this with three players but more than that and the board tends to get a bit too messy with bits everywhere and worse if you are playing with messy players.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy this game.  It's a lot of fun and presents many interesting choices.  My one gripe is that it's a "beat on the leader game," but victory points are hidden, so it becomes a "beat on the perceived leader," game.  I've played in games where people were clearly beating on the wrong person, which can be blamed on the players being bad at estimation, but still, not so fun.  This can be solved with a house rule, "add a victory point track," if everyone is willing.

Another solution is to play with two, in which case this doesn't matter. The two-player game is my favorite version of this.

RATING: 7
Small World follows a similar objective to Risk, mainly take over the world. It improves upon Risk in many ways though. There is less luck involved as you don't roll dice to take over other factions territory. Most attacking and defending is decided by the sheer number of pieces you are willing to use to take or defend each individual space. There is some die rolling involved toward the end of turns when you can roll to determine if you will receive one, two or three reinforcement units. 

The mixing and matching of different factions and special abilities also leads to a lot more interested and dynamic playthroughs. Although even after about ten games I feel like I have seen many of the different combinations and there is far less diversity than I originally thought. 

Small World can become stale after playing it repetitively in a short time period, but I'm almost always down to play it, especially after its been a while since the last time. It's definitely a must have standard.

RATING: 7.5
7.5 - The game is fun, and while being a tactical strategy game with little hidden knowledge (only your point values are hidden from other players) it still manages to be different each time and makes people curse as you decline right before they do and take the race they really wanted.

Not technically mine, but it resides with me.

A neat game with a simple core of rules.  My feelings are love/hate.  The components, as always, are top notch and the art is whimsical - almost too much so in order to find things on the board.  The races and powers are novel, however, the combinations and permutations along with some odd wording make it a little hard to pick up on the first shot.  The hidden VP coins are annoying and there is a lot of pickup and placement whenever a new race is added or removed.  The FAQ is huge and still doesn't address all the issues.

This would make a great PC game.  :-)  Hopefully Days of Wonder will put it on their site.

A good game.  Will it last?  Who knows.

A fantasy version of Vinci.  There is more variety in the possible fantasy nations that you are trying to expand.  But this requires an appreciation of the relative merits of nations on the board and coming up to be able to play it well.

Small world, big game.
Excelent components, theme and artwork.
The game goes fast and it's a terrible mess, as it's meant to be, and feels good to me.
Tons of different races with distinct powers quickly entering, expanding, and declining all over the tiny world map, really chaotic.
It took me a bunch of games till I began to ponder the right choices and strategies, at first all combos seemed almost equally cool and powerful.
But even once you're familiar with all races and powers, and know when it's the time to do what, you can't never be much ahead, as it's also a negotiation game and sooner or later comes a "hey, let's stop the leader" yell.
It's also one of the favorites of our daughter aged 8, so my wife and I play it three-player very frequently.

This is the game you show your friends who keep asking you to play Risk. For advanced gamers, it probably comes down to a kingmaking situation too often to be consistently enjoyable, but if you just want to get together with a bunch of friends and put guys on a map and then smash each other, this is the best game to do that. The fact that the game has a predetermined turn limit is such a huge improvement over other similar games.

Edit: Played again and my rating went up. When you have a group that's laughing and having a good time and doesn't care about bean-counting everyone's points, this game is an absolute riot. It's simple, but it has a great fantasy feel and still feels like a giant war.

Nice combinations and diversity and it's actually quite fun, the game's a bit shallow though. Prone to kingmaking and it doesn't encourage fighting. The player that just sits quiet in the corner can win the game. Doesn't work very will with 2 players. The graphics are a bit over the top and with all that colors, its quite hard to figure out which tile is which, what it does and whether it's in decline or not. After a while, you'll learn most of the combos and will pick simply the "best" ones. Still, a very nice game, though the theme can be "repelling".

Great iOS version - go get it.

I own the digital version of this, and I have fun playing it on occasion. I like that each race has its own specific mechanics that can make it more or less powerful, and that this is constantly changing, depending on what other races are on the board. I think it's also great that it has a different customized map size for each number of potential players, which means that the game is always just right for however many people are around.

I really thought I would hate this game.  But it does have some merit.  The vast number of combinations among the various units is really cool.

At the beginning of the game a set of armies (with their own special powers) is combined with an additional special power.  Player can choose which army/special power combo to take.

Basically you get a multiplayer conquest game where players need to abandon their gains and start over at the right time.  They do this by letting their existing army go in to decline and choosing a new army to fight with.  Armies in decline continue to earn the controlling player points for territory held but can no longer do anything.

The available armies are there for everyone to see.  The various special player powers add a constantly changing set of unique armies whose powers need to be taken in to consideration.

The art is terrible.  So bad that its hard to look at the pictures of some of the armies.  The last thing I want to see is a bunch of slobbering dwarfs in front of me.  The board is also garishly cartoonish.  It's confusing and annoying to look at.  If you want to draw people (especially kids whom the art seems to be aimed at) into a game like this you need to make it "cool" not "dorky".

Additionally the game is horrifically fiddly.  Each of the many armies has a set of chits.  Many of the special powers also come with chits and markers of various kinds.  Everyone needs a full size cheat sheet to explain all the special powers.  Two different boards printed on both sides for a total of four maps are included.  A different map is used for each of the player configurations (2 to 5 players).

In the end we have a fun quick light conquest game with high quality, if terribly ugly, production.

Este é um dos meus favoritos e um dos primeiros que adquiri para meu acervo de jogos modernos. Considero-o um wargame com domínio de área. Há muitas raças com comportamentos distintos que podem ser combinadas com vários poderes, fazendo combos que mudam o jogo sutilmente em cada partida.
Muito divertido, muito bem construído e com uma arte maravilhosa... realmente, um jogo primoroso.

If you can get over the fiddly nature of the components, then this is a fun game to play. Choose a race, arrive on the board, have some carnage and then start again with a new race.

RATING: 8
Crazy amount of fun. As you're playing, it feels like there should be a lot of strategy. However, there's so many variables that there's actually less strategy than it seems. However, I think this gives it a solid mix of strategy vs luck.

Only issue I came across was that the Merchant Elves are a broken combo. They can rack up massive amounts of points. The only to break the combo is to play the vampires against them.

RATING: 8.5
The combination of different races and powers makes this a new game almost every time it is played. Easy to teach, fun to play, plenty of strategy. Great game!

Edit: I've played with 2, 3, and 4...and the play gets better each time. I'm finding that I need to better gauge which races will give the best benefit.

Edit, Part 2: I've changed this to a 10. The replayability is very high, and the expansions keep adding new races and powers. It's easy to teach, fun to play, and different every time. 

Edit: Back down to a 8.5. I need to play this more to find the fun I used to have. I don't remember the races and find myself looking things up too much.

The upside:
-Lots of combinations of races can contribute to give very different games.
-Awesome abstraction of a stock market. You are trying to increase your race potential until you start to see the decline and decide to get rid of them. It's like having the right stock at the right time.

The downside:
-Too much sillyness in theme and art.
-"Hey, let's all attack this guy..."

Great mechanics, good pace and flow, great theme, you can get back into the game after not succeeding on your first race, just a lot of fun and probably pretty inviting as a almost-gateway game (after Settlers, Carc, or TtR).

One thing - the game MAY [i]need[/i] at least one expansion to allow for enough races so the pile doesn't run out and leave a 5 player game with not enough options (not fair).

Risk meets D&D Monster Manual. With over 10 different types of civilizations that you can place to gain strategic footholds on the board - each civ. has unique aspects to them. The game feels new and exciting with a bunch of possibilities, but once the honeymoon phase is over you start to realize that each civ. really only plays a certain way and there is not much outside of how they operate that Small World offers.

That is not to say that it is boring. Small World has replay value in sheer combinations of civs. you play, but it does not have nearly as much options in gameplay that it lends itself to have.

It is less boring than Risk though, and can make those who normally hate those strategy area control games reconsider. Definitely a gateway. It has just enough different flavor and fantasy elements to draw wide appeal.

Although I'm suspicious the game doesn't come down to much more than managing to get a good combo and avoiding a stinker while keeping your head down, it is the quickest conquer and invade game I've played.

Typically beautiful looking game by DOW.  But I don't like it for some reason. It's a variable power area control game, but I never feel any tension or excitement during gameplay.

An early acquisition in my honeymoon phase with the hobby. I've always felt like Small World should have gotten more love from my group, but the sad fact is: nobody ever wants to play it. Descended from the game Vinci (which I have never played) it has you randomly pairing races with powers for interesting, and often hilarious, combinations. I've always felt like the rising and declining of the various races fells very restrictive and I think the others in my group feel the same way. But this is a good game if you're looking for a game [i]similar[/i] to Risk, but marginally more interesting, slightly less luck-y, and a lot more lighthearted in tone.

It's a nice and easy game to introduce to wargaming newbies. It has all the things going on for a wargame (conquering, defence, strategic elements), but is simple to play and you can't screw up in a major way.

My only gripe is perhaps the overly colorful board, but I did never really lose touch with who anyone was or where were they. I just wish that DoW would tone down the texturing of different elements which interferes with tokens etc.

The aspect of Small World that I find most enjoyable is the combining of different races with different special abilities.  It's so exciting to sit in suspense and wonder if you are going to get to pick the combo that you think is cool.  Each combo has advantages and fun ways to play, so it makes the game replayable.  I also like the mostly diceless combat system.  

But overall, it's not as exciting as many other games because I don't get thrilled with direct conflict games. So while the components are pretty and the game is quick playing and enjoyable, Small World is not a game that I'd want to always play.

Okay game of area control earning victory points.  Looks like this game would get redundant after a while.  The strength of the game is that players are never eliminated from play, which is also its weakness since players never have an afinity with the race that they choose.  I could play this game once in a while.

Personally, I prefer Vinci.  The Small World board was more colorful, but the terrain felt less diverse (unless you happened to have race that differentiated things).  I really missed the connectivity requirement.  This is more accessible than Vinci, but each change has diminished the aspects of the original that I found most appealing.  Still, with 4 players, I'd split plays between this and Vinci to keep both fresh and interesting.

Played twice with 3 players.  

I am conflicted on this game.  First, what I like about Smallworld.  I enjoy the theme, and I feel the random combination of race+modifier is a neat idea. Also, it plays quickly which is a plus without much downtime between turns.  The components and board(s) are high quality and nice to look at.

My problem with Smallworld is that it seems that the only major decision to be made is when to put your race into decline and pick a new one.  The attacking seems pretty obvious - attack until you run out of tokens.  Defending seems nearly impossible if a race has Dragon Master, or flying, etc.  Some race/ability combos are so much better than others that if you are the unlucky person to get the weak combo you are toast - as there seems to be no way to use tactics typically.

Regardless of my percieved flaws, I would play it again - but its not a game I would purchase or push to play.

You never play the same game twice. The amount of variety in the game is absolutely humongous. It's also crazy fun. The boards are sized perfectly for the different number of players (it comes with 2 two-sided boards for 2, 3, 4, and 5 players). It gets crowded and there will definitely be conflict! Super easy to learn and just an insane amount of fun.

I like a lot of what's going on in this game - the variable races, the different powers, how they interact and the decision on when to put someone in decline.  While the game appears to be a conquest game, it's really more about evaluating the race/power combos and deciding which can be put to the best use at the time.  I'm not sure if I REALLY like doing that yet, so I'll need to play this a few more times.

A very funny quick playing family game. It never bores me and through the many combinations you can adopt diverse playing styles. When you play with none slow friends you can play with ease 4 game on a row and still hunger for a replay :)  In my opinion it is a very balanced game. Although some bbg's 'complain' about some overpowered combinations (like elves with commando) I must disagree with them after replayed this scene a few times. At the end it's all about collecting the most victory points  instead having the biggest army. This all exlains this real EXTREME high rating. It is diverse, quick, never boring and balanced. Whenever I get bored. I'll adjust the rating :)

We were fortunate enough to be able to borrow this game from a friend.  We played through once and IMMEDIATELY played it again - then went out and purchased it.  There are so many great and original concepts in this game.

The replay value of this game is VERY high.  With the number of combinations for type and skill vs type and skill for every player...you could probably play this game every day for the rest of your life and still not experience every combo.  So cool!

We have played a few games with 5 people and I wouldn't recommend it.  With 5 players there is just too much down time.

We've since worn out on this game and have traded it away.  I still enjoy it and would have hung onto it had there not been another person in our play group that has it.  It is a fun game.

This game is a blast.  I love seeing what combinations of Races and Powers come up so it's a little different every time you play.  It's easy to learn and has a good amount of strategy in Power/Race combos and where the optimal place to attack is.

Rick's Rules of Thumb:
1 - Always* take Ghouls if they come up early game.
2 - Always* take Merchant.
3 - More tokens are better, but make sure you are scoring plenty of coins each turn - that's what matters.
4 - Going in decline earlier than you should have is always* better than later than you should have.

*OK, maybe not 'always' but 'most of the time.'

RATING: 7.5
It's a simplified version of Vinci that plays in an hour and a half. The actual manouvering on the map is generally more of an excercise in diplomacy than grand strategy; the real descisions are when to go in to decline, and which race to pick.

Edit: Getting a real kick out of this on ipad, after having a mediocre experience with the boardgame. We didn't like the artwork on the box or the fiddliness -- neither of which are present on the ipad. Looking forward to trying out the boardgame version again. The one problem that still persists is it feels very basic and limited, especially since going into decline takes up one of ten turns. Do that twice (which will happen most games), and you really just have eight turns to work with -- and each of these turns feels fairly straightforward in a two-player game. Once your deck starts thinning out, there aren't too many interesting decisions to make. I do appreciate the balance of this game, though (Dwarves excepted) -- something that I'm starting to appreciate more and more in the games that do it right.

I wanted to like this game.  I really did.  Somehow I never found it very much fun.  There ought to be more politics but there isn't.  There ought to be more strategy but there isn't.  I usually end up figuring how to make the most points each turn and hope for the best.

I might be playing wrong.

I own the electronic version still, but sold my physical copy.

RATING: 5
I do not like about this game that the map is uniform. By  that I mean that there is no clustering of any terrain types or special symbols. Furthermore there is no area on the map, which you could shield from ohter players (for example for defending your perished race tokens). This removal of spatial elements (especially in combination with the ability to withdraw your race and enter the map from a different side) destroys most of the fun I expect from a light, tactical war game. Even though the rules are not complicated, this game is still hard to bring to table with new players, since there so many special abilities to explain.

RATING: 10
Haven't had time lately to play many games, with a soon to be 1 year old occupying most free time. However, when she goes to bed and we are still somewhat awake, this is the game we grab- it plays in about 40 mins, very low set up time, not too much of a brain-burner, but enough interesting decisions to make it worth playing, and FUN. don't see any reason not to play with the Cursed and Ladies expansions.

played mainly 2p games, but the time we've been able to play more have been very fun. I especially like the hidden VP-- it's quite fun when you *think* you know who is out front and act accordingly, but realize at the end how far off you were.

I've just discovered this game a few weeks ago and only have 4-5 games played so far. I can honestly say that it is a nice strategic game, similar to Risk but with more variety because of all the different races possible and the mixing of special powers. It is quicker to play than Risk, with less luck since you barely use any dice (only for your last conquest each turn). It makes for fun, quick games. I'm glad to own it!!

Great game to play with my 6-year-old son.  Beautiful production values and elegant design with interesting decisions.

Would probably like it more if it moved quicker.  As it is, it's in the same space as Ticket-To-Ride as a fine game I'll play with friends and family, but it's a little light for my tastes.

Update Jan 2016: Played with family over Christmas.  5 people, 3 of whom hadn't played before and were slightly intimidated by all the cardboard bits.  They all liked it well enough by the end.  Opinion hasn't changed: Fine game, but a little 'meh'.

RATING: 8.1
(April 28th, '09): Loving Small World.  Its job is simple: fill the month before Steam comes out.  Way things are going, it'll be getting "Employee of the Month."  8.5 rating for now.  Could easily get higher if it keeps my interest.  Fun with 2 or 3 players (haven't tried more yet).  My son (6 years-old) has picked it up quickly and we're having fun with it too.  I need to do a better job of picking the right race.

(Aug '09): Moved rating from 8.5 to 8.  Just not playing it much anymore.  But played a ton of it in two months time with buddies, family, and club kids at school. Very well received.

(Feb '10): Moved rating down to a 7.  I still think it's a good game and would like to play it every 6 months or so, but it's not near my Top 10 or anything.

Having played this one with the kids a couple times, I'm finding I really like it.  It's in that sweet spot, where it's deep enough for the adults to enjoy, but simple enough that my young boys (5 and 7) can play it with us and keep up.  They don't win as often as Mom and Dad do, but they still play and play pretty well.

Recommended.

RATING: 6.6
Small world is a fairly simple game. Players purchase races with which they try to occupy areas. The more areas a player occupies the more points they score. Races are made up with a combination of two special powers that change from game to game. Some of these make conquering areas easier, some score victory points. At any time players can abandon their present race and get a new one.
The whole thing is quite clever, and provides a clear optimisation challenge (its firmly in the Eurogame mould except for its much heavier stomp the other players option). However, it has one huge flaw, the rules are badly written. Not the core rules, no, but the special rules for each race are often ambiguous and unclear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
Light hearted fun, best with more players.  The races & traits make for some humorous combinations.  However, the limited choices available reduce the replay ability of this game for me.
Played with 5 players and finally found it had more strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Small World is an enjoyable game with very simple mechanics and a nice strategic feel from having an attractive map of "Smallworld".

The areas of weakness in it's design are :

1 the lack of player involvement when others are taking their turns.

2 thus there are no defensive player local counterattacks or modifiers
that might make the game interactive during other's turns.

3 as a result, especially when one changes powers and basically forfeits any activity that turn there are long periods of player downtime and boredom.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is really really good.
The combinations of abilities and races make for great laughs. It's like an advanced risk, but way better. Constantly calculating the benefits of picking which race at what time (timing is of great importance), where to attack, who to take on etc. is actually fun!
This game just begs for you to come up with your own races/abilities and I already came up with a few :-).
Most importantly, this game is a huge hit with my girl ;-)

Wonderfull game !
Quite easy to learn, but harder to master.
Accessible to kids (9 y.o. up) as much as to adults.
A lot of fun and not too long to play.
DoW forum offers quick support for any rules questions.
Four different maps, adapted to 2, 3, 4 and 5 players - and the different number of players generates different types of games.
The race + ability combinations offer a constantly changing game.
People are asking for extensions, less than two weeks after the game came out : a sign that it is a real blast.

RATING: 7
Decent lightish war-type game, made endearing (and more replayable) by the different combinations of races and abilities which come out at random - often with deliciously silly names. I find this game quite entertaining, and not without some tricky decisions - even if it's not one I would want to play all the time. However, we've not played it since 2012, and probably never will again - the player in our group who owns it has said he doesn't like it any more. And strangely, it's a game I think I appreciate more now than I did when we still played it!

(08/20/09) - I've been looking for another light area-control / basic wargame for some time now. Hopefully Small World fits the bill.

(10/05/09) - [8] - After a pair of plays I'm giving Small World an 8. It is flexible with a variety of players and it's simple but semi-deep gameplay appeals to me.

(5/2/13) - Small World has been sold as part of a general liquidation of much of my collection.

RATING: 9.5
We first played the Underground version of Small World with our friends Kieth and Conney. 

I liked it a lot- I compare it to a mix between Risk and Magic The Gathering, simplified and stylized for everyone.

Huge fan of simplistic games here, especially when they can give way to multiple win paths and re-playablility like Small World does.

We bought the base version, this one, and can't stop playing it. Small World is a Great game. Here is what I like:

1) I can teach this game to anyone in about 2 minutes. No need for rules, just start playing and everyone can start playing on their turn. Do a 'fake game' run through for a round or 2, then poof! everyone knows how to play.

2) The game boards and pieces are super high quality, just awesome. Amazing artwork. Fun too.

3) Simple to learn, hard to master. Lots of re-playability.

4) 4 game boards. The first has a 2-player and 3-player side, then 2nd has a 4-player and 5-player side. This, above all else, wins me over to Small World. It is so important to have game balance AND multiple player variations. 

5) Each game is much different than the one before.

6) Accessible to hard core board/card gamers and casual monopoly/rummy player types too. All ages.

What I don't like:

1) Sometimes species-ability combos are overpowered. Commando on turn 1. Spirit Ghouls in the hands of an experienced player. House rules take care of both of these right away. 

2) Sometimes combos are difficult to figure out. There are 3 pages or errata. This is a problem, if you don't do the work. We read up, printed errata, and learned them all. Once one player knows the quirks, they can help others learn the correct rules and combos.

3) The Biggie. While the components are just the best, and the box has slots for all of them, which is a huge bonus in my book, there is one problem. The tray that holds the species units, is a monster. It is not labeled, and often the squares get stuck or wont come out without a lot of diddling around.

We used sticker labels to keep everything sorted out, it works well enough. I have seen newer editions of Small World that appear to have resolved this issue. However:

Whoever thought that a TOP-LOADING tray was a good idea for SIDE LOADING pieces was a moron. Why is this tray not designed like sugar-packet trays at restaurants? You know- with the pieces each popping out by pulling from the front- with a sort of cut-out slot in the front of each tray? 

That would have been a simple fix, just changing the plastic mold for the tray, and would save us a lot of time every game. It was the most disappointing part of buying Small World. 

**
The first two negatives are mechanic things that are resolved with a lot of play-time under your belt. The 3rd, the tray, is a permanent problem. Stupid of them to build it that way, just stupid.

4) Thats it. I have no other negative concerns. This game is top notch. If it was not for the tray-stuff, this game would get a 10 hands down.

I can't give a game a 10 with such a pain-in-the-kisser kind of physical design mistake. Ignoring that, this is one of my favorite games ever. Mindy loves it too, and everyone we play it with has a good time. 9 point five.

Based on one 3-player game.  My one big complaint about 'Vinci' is that the beginning, middle, and end game all feel identical, which is a bad thing for a 2-hr game.  'Small World' addresses the issue by shortening the playing time.  I think the duration of the game is now perfect for what it offers.

All the joys of Vinci are here.  Watching the rise and decline of civilizations is as pleasant as watching the ebb and flow of the ocean.  The changes to the rules are minor but wise polishes.  I'm happy to see the clunkiness removed from Vinci.

Pandering, bash-the-leader, nonsense. Don't bother thinking of a path to victory; this game will dicate it for you. Due to predetermined ability-pairings, your (at times, imbalanced) strength in Small World is attained with no discernible effort, and thus your strategy is scripted. "The quietest player wins" is what someone quipped about this game. Too true. I was left alone, avoided conflict when I could (half my game spent 'Diplomatic') and won with over 90 points. This was my first play, in a group of experienced gamers that were too busy bashing each others' heads in to notice.

It's almost comical how well-received this is, as I can think of numerous entry-level area majority and/or area control games that surpass it by various degrees: First and foremost, Olympos (Keyaert's later title), classics like San Marco, Web of Power, and El Grande, niche titles like Quebec, and the more modern and ultimately more streamlined, Ethnos. These aren't all ace games, though a select few are stellar, but they are certainly stronger alternatives to this snoozefest.

Really streamlined, and simple, wargame. Easy to teach and play. The complexity of the game comes from the race and special power combos. It's disappointing that some of the strategy elements from Vinci are gone, such as the rule of cohesion and the changed dynamic of mountains and forests. Simplifying the game probably makes it play quicker, but I think a lot of the quicker play time comes from the set number of turns in the game. Changing to a set number of turns is a huge, welcome change over Vinci, as the end game was one of the things I disliked the most. The game is perhaps too streamlined now, but it is still a lot of fun, definitely more accessible, and can play in a much shorter timeframe.

Fun game... a lot of funny combinations come up (but after a few games it wears off a bit). The strategy isn't bad, but it's mostly about timing your races and picking a powerful race combination. 

The one thing I don't like is that people can decide to make it their task of the game to not let you win. Someone can focus on attacking you and only you the entire game just so you don't win (they won't either). Basically... the winner of this game is often the person that gets attacked the least.

I don't have a really strong opinion on the Vinci vs. Small World question.  Small World was certainly fun, but I didn't think hidden score was any great improvement, nor did I think having separate race tokens (as opposed to player tokens in easy-to-distinguish colors) helped.  I also think they oversimplified things just a bit.  Vinci's innate defensive bonus for mountains was kept, so why not forest?  And why negate much of the interest of mountains by (mostly) getting rid of the advantage of attacking out of them?  That was the balance that made up for the extra difficulty in getting into them!

All in all, it's fun because it's a fun system, but I wouldn't insist on playing either version.

Nice game, but feels as if there aren't enough races and powers to make sure that each game is different. Too many of the races are mild variants on a theme, such as "bonus points for forests" and "bonus points for plains". The special abilities need to be more special than that.

area control game that plays kinda like a war game. not much randomness, although lucky starts can happen. crazy combos pop up in the race/power market, but they're somewhat mitigated by the breadcrumb trail of victory points a player has to leave behind to take one. i love the agony of deciding when to go into decline and how hard it is to miss a turn, although everyone will encounter that at least once (probably twice!) during the game. 5-player can feel a little chaotic and 2-player can feel a lot like a knife fight (why waste time on neutral guy when you can just stomp all over your opponent? it's mean and it's nasty and sadly it's effective), but the differently balanced maps for each player count really help to fit the situation. very fun game! quick to teach, despite all those many powers. not sure why this game gets so much hate, unless it's from the direct conflict vibe. yeah, that should bug me, but i'm often having too much fun to take it personally!

I just don't know what it is about this game. It came a little after the gateway games that first pulled me in and in theory should be right up my alley, the fact that each time the type of creatures you are can be different and the quicker turn over war style game should be fun for me. But there is just something not connecting. Husband was good at it with our introducing friends but surprisingly when asked later on if he wanted to get it was opposed. Not sure why, this just didn't land with us though by all means it should have.

Fun, silly war/area control game.  Most of the fun and strategy is based on picking your race/special power combinations.  After that the game is just a lot of attacking people.

Понимание игры приходит уже во время первой партии. В начальных раундах ты делаешь всё по инструкции, но уже в середины игры правила можно выбрасывать в сторону. Ведь чтение отвлекает от захвата земель и уничтожения противника!

Along with Lords of Waterdeep, this is the other game that hits the table almost every game session. Think Risk mixed up with D&D. However, with different race/power combos every time, each game is new and exciting. This game has some of the best re-playability of any title. Totally fun, easy to play but with some nuances that will favor the experienced player. A must have for any collection.

I wasn't sure I'd like this game - killing off races all the time and whatnot, but it is fun and because you move through races so fast, killing off each other doesn't feel so vicious (maybe that's partly how I play, but oh, well).  The game boards are fabulous, with different sides for different numbers of people, really making it work for the different sized games.  This is a huge bonus in my mind. (JW)

RATING: 5
I really fell in love with it the first time I played it. Eventually I purchased it and have played it around 10 times since. The game is pretty much dead to me now.

Biggest problem with the game is the amount of time it takes to play. For what the game is, it takes too long. There really aren't a lot of decisions to make. Pretty much everything is obvious.

The randomness of the race/power combos make the game varied, but some are so absurdly overpowered that it can ruin the game and cause one person to run away with it. 

In the end, this game disappointed me and I was very upset because I figured this was one I would enjoy for a long time.

RATING: 6
The pricing ladder of randomized races/traits is a great mechanic that I would like to see in more games.  I didn't like it after my first play, as the game play on the board is pretty boring and mechanical, but there is fun to be had in deciding when to go into decline and trying to clear out your opponents' in-decline regions.  My rating is slowing going up; need more plays.

RATING: 5
--Apr2009-- On first blush, more interesting than its ancestor Vinci.  The presentation is pretty good (though, like some other voices, I'd like a bit more color or other distinction on the [i]in decline[/i] side of the faction counters and a bit more color delta between woods and hills.)  It plays very cleanly for a game with as much potential for analytic paralysis, but is probably at its best when played breezily.
--Jun2009-- Yet after a few plays, it's not as clear.  I think the tide has turned, and I'd prefer to play Vinci - if I had to choose between the two family members.  But given that I rate neither terribly highly, I'd prefer something else.
--Dec2009-- After a couple more plays, I'm less enchanted.  The matrix of race and modifier leads to a rather chaotic evaluation problem.  And the game is mostly about that evaluation problem, with a bit of interplayer whining "Attack her, not me" thrown in.  I find I'm even less enthusiastic about the game when I win than when I lose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great production value. The artwork is awesome, and really makes the entire game have a great cohesive feel to it.

Overall, a fun game that takes a little bit of preparation, but the core mechanics are pretty simple and the 'stop and think' moments are mostly limited to choosing a new race (but this can be overwhelming for new players, since there's so much reading and number-crunching involved). Other than that, gameplay is generally pretty quick and has some fun strategy to work around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I already enjoyed Vinci, but have to say that this is much more accessible.  I like the added theme and the combinations that come up with the races.  The game is shorter than Vinci, but the planning has an added element to it due to the turn based end and the race combos can play heavily in the jockeying for points.

It is a very funny boardgame on a fantasy world. Each player chooses their own race and special ability to contest on a congested continent. As a multi-player area control, there got to be some ‘natural friend & foe’ factors. Besides, the combination of a special power and a race can be freakishing powerful. However, all is fun to me. I like to have some combos like the flying dwarves or diplomatic zombies and wealthy skeletons and every funny stuff. Replayability is always not a problem for me.

    [i]"I like Chicken McNuggets."


        Of course you do. Everyone does. Chicken McNuggets were designed by a committee whose goal was to create a food considered "good enough" by a maximal number of Americans. Small World went through the same process.

            S.
[/i]










Just not a lot of decision-making here.  The game plays itself very nicely for the most part, occasionally asking you for a bit of input.

Decisions do occur when it's time to decline, and there was some interest there for me on a couple of occasions.  That doesn't happen very often though -- the bulk of the game is GACMITS and I didn't find it compelling.  It's just not a game that requires very much thought.  The game plays itself.

Very pretty package though.  Days of Wonder sure knows how to fill a box.  I understand that this game is geared towards the family market, and I should consider it in that light -- it's an intentionally soft play.  But soft doesn't have to mean uninspiring, and I think that's happened on this one.  For kids I think some of Days of Wonder's other titles would be a far better choice - Pirates Cove, Ticket to Ride or Memoir '44 all come to mind, largely because their theme has some edge to it and you can put your own personality into the play.  Small World lacks that.  You can leave the table for a bit and have other people take your turn for you without it mattering very much.

[b][u]Here's the real disappointment -- there's the remains of a game here that got stomped on.  [/u]

If you could eliminate multiples of an opponent's pieces in a territory you would have some level of tactical action in the game.  You'd have to worry about defense, and position, and consolidation.  Territory would have meaning.

Or, if you could press your luck with that cool six-sider on [u]every[/u] advance it would make for a press-your-luck element that would really require you to make tough decisions and live with the consequences.  You'd have to measure your options carefully, splitting troops with care, not boxing yourself in -- you'd own your game.  Even the one special ability that allows you to use that die each time offers it [u]prior[/u] to the attack decision (and the rule is carefully written to indicate that, as if someone did it the other way during playtest and mistakenly stumbled across too much joy.)

[i]Alas, none of that is the case.  What remains is a very simple, very tepid game, a slice of milquetoast that consumes itself while you watch.  I'm very surprised it's getting the attention that it does.[/i]

A fun and fast paced game. This is a great game to take out when I play with a large (5-6) group of friends who are unfamiliar with the new generation of board games. The game shows off a lot of the fun and dynamic properties of new generation board games without the plethora of rules or calculations that can be involved. Even with the many combinations of races and abilities, I find that this game does not have unlimited replayability. For me, the game is too simple to be truly engaging after several plays.

Very much the type of game I like. I always liked History of the World even though it took a bit too long to play. I never played Vinci but Small World plays quickly and I actually like the silly theme. I like the type of games where you have easy basic rules and then special abilities (in this case race and special power combos) that break them. Also Days of Wonder have outdone themselves with the components and packaging in this game. I will gladly play some extra for the kind of quality components and custom tray as in Small World.

It's certainly a very streamlined game that is easy to teach and pick up; still, I'm not convinved that it is anything special. The movement and conquest of new territories is a little dull, and the only really interesting choice is when to go into decline and what new race to take. Despite the apparent replayability created by the mixture of racial and special powers, I'm not really sure that these are different and interesting enough to make it a better, more exciting and varied game than the many other multi-player games of this level of complexity. 

UPDATE: I have just read drunkenKOALA's very good review, and am thinking that I will certainly give the game a few more goes (assuming I get the chance) to see if it grows on me.

UPDATE 2: My most recent play was more enjoyable. Perhaps it does fill a nice niche of a simple game for the family with direct conflict.

Xmas 2012 for Graeme from me

I bought this game for Graeme for a Christmas present.  He had been talking about it for a while ever since he played a game with some of his friends and I'm really glad I caved in and bought because it is a fantastic game.

It took a little while to get used to the rules, the first time we played (just the 2 of us) was a bit of a disaster, Graeme won but I'm sure half his moves were illegal.  After a few more plays and with more people the game was a lot more fun and surprisingly straight forward once you get used to switching (declining) armies every few turns.

I would highly recommend the game the artwork is fantastic, I'm a big fantasy reader so the characters really appealed to me. I love the different combinations of characters and special ability, every time you play it is a different game and I'm sure we will look forward to playing this many times more.

Gorgeous, fast, simple to learn and play, variable. Probably not something that'll se a lot of use, but nice to pull out for an impromptu evening of easy wargaming. My gamer, but non-wargamer, friends liked it but were not overly enthusiastic. As I enjoy a little complexity, Small World felt a bit light. Falls between the cracks, hooking neither target group, yet still playable. A preferrable alternative to Risk, with less randomization.

In hindsight, this is a gorgeous game with terrific artwork and (for me) uninteresting gameplay.

RATING: 5
I love the concept of this game -- a tribe sweeps through an area and is slowly picked apart before making way for a new tribe. The game is about timing -- should I pull out this turn or make a final push? I also really like the different powers and how they can be combined in various ways. The box insert is also probably the best I've seen.

As it turns out the gameplay is pretty dull and mechanical. You're usually just going for the hills or the swamp or whatever. The biggest choices you have to make are whether you want to go in decline and which new tribe to choose, but these choices are mechanical too as you're just counting off potential points. I love maths but this is just tedious for me.

The saving grace of this game is the app which speeds everything up, but I still don't often feel like playing it.

Visual Appeal: (5)
I really like the unique style of the creatures in this game. The artist presents some of the usual tropes in quirky ways that really attract gamers from the moment they see the box. The creatures/powers fit together nicely.

Components: (4)
This is great component quality overall. There are so many little chips and all of them are nicely organized in the convenient custom box insert. I don't like how hard it is to get them out sometimes, so I hot glued the end of a ribbon in each section. If you place the chips on top of the ribbon, you can simply pull it and they'll all pop out. The board is nice looking, double-sided, and the regions are easy to see.

Theme: (5)
I've heard that this is a re-working of an older title called "Vinci". I don't know enough to compare the theme because I haven't played it. I can say though that the theme works just fine here. The simulation of empires rising and falling over time is nicely done with the in-decline mechanism. All of the creatures and powers are very flavorful and work just like you'd expect them to with the theme. Berserk creatures have random attack bonuses, Halflings have hidey-holes, and Trolls have caves. None of them really feel out of place or broken.

Learning: (4)
The main point in teaching this game is really just to make sure the players understand how "in-decline" scoring works. Everything else is basic math! I have not experienced anyone having trouble learning the game. From what I recall, the rules are fairly succinct and clear. They also provide a great full description of all the creatures and powers.

Gameplay: (5)
There is backstabbing galore in this game. As soon as you go into decline, you can expect players to jump all over you like a dog on a bone. One of my favorite things to do is to convince people that another player is a threat. Since VPs are hidden until the end of the game, a few good rounds will make you a quick target to anyone not wise enough to keep score in their head. It is a huge benefit to know which power combos are actually powerful and which ones will burnout quickly.

Overall Fun: (5)
This is one of my favorite games and I've played it to death. The expansions add more variety, without changing the basic game, and that's  a good thing. This is not a game that gets strength from complexity. I think it's a great game and most of my friends agree. The ones who wanted more were usually looking for something like a strategic area control game.

My latest addiction. A great variety of combos of fantasy-themed races and abilities, and the wrinkle of switching races as you use up one's potential. I think there is some good depth of strategy, as the combos can be used in different ways to either score for yourself or hamper opponents. The hidden victory points create tension and the opportunity for bluffing. Definitely like it more than Vinci.

This one became a fast favorite!  My girl (who decided that we should buy it after looking at the box) is a fierce opponent - I often beat her in most other games we play, but she usually delivers some seriously painful smackdowns in Small World.  After a few months of play, though, it lost a bit of its "oomph."  This was largely because we became familiar with all the combos, which removed a lot of the unpredictability that was present in earlier games.  Fortunately, it got resurrected by the expansions, which injected a ton of replay value back into the game.  This is especially true of "Tales and Legends."  It takes a great game and makes it even better (it's a rare thing for an expansion to add a new mechanic to a game and have that mechanic fit so neatly that it feels like it's a part of the original design).

Only played one game so far and it was not the right time to be playing (late - and people were getting tired), but even then we managed to have fun. 

Before people memorize all the different race and perk tiles, the game relies heavily on reading the surprisingly large player aid.

I played the game with a group where half the people didn't speak/read English which made the explaining of every available race very tedious, as well as explaining their usefulness on the map (i.e. these guys can take advantage of areas with these symbols etc.).

But as I said, we still managed to have a ton of fun, and my dad ruled the game for quite a few turns with his Flying Amazons. I mention this as he doesn't usually like playing games, and this race + perk combo made him thoroughly enjoy the game.

The game was ultimately and surprisingly won by my 9 year old nephew, who thought he was going to be dead last, but his dragon poking rats, mountain dwelling giants and field loving humans ultimately brought the most sustainable points.

I lost miserably with my poorly performing orcs and even more lackluster ghouls.

I think several play-throughs will only make the game better as people get better at picking the right combos, and understanding what to do with them.

This was sadly just as boring as expected :P. I think I'm just now finding out I don't really much care for these area majority games (I recently played Rex/Dune and Chaos in the Old World, which are in a similar vein). Except for El Grande, which at least is not repetitive.

RATING: 7
This is a light board game with a decent amount of strategy that appeals to both the casual gamer group and the more strategy-oriented gamer. While the game is about rising and falling civilizations vying for area control (with limited dice rolling involved, thankfully), the best part of Small World and its expansions is the combination of races and special abilities. Ever wanted those ghouls to fly? Well, this game lucky for you, there are flying ghouls. Want to take the area around the lake and not have to worry about spreading yourself too thin? Diplomatic tritons! There are many combinations, many offering hilarious but sometimes overpowered results. As a result this game isn't too heavy and shouldn't be for the serious-minded. For everyone else, it's a blast to play and is one of those games where expansions are well worth the cost.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some great pros on this one: nice art and components, and extremely easy to teach due to very simple rules make it a perfect game to introduce to non-gamers. It is not hard to understand what to do, making it even more friendly to new gamers. On the other hand it makes it too shallow for experienced gamers.
The numerous combinations of races and abilities extends its replayability but that may be just a trick, as you basically always do the same thing.
The problem with this game is the way the winner is decided. The quiet player is most of the time the winner. Also with 3 or 5 players it is common that players fight each other in pairs giving the victory to the last one. And lets admit it, when you suffered a genocide from player A, it is difficult to put logic over revenge and go for player B. And if you do, you will most probably manage to have both players A and B ravaging you.
Nevertheless, if people in you gaming party aim for fun, then go for it! Small world will not let you down. If they are competitive and play to win, this game could be a trouble.

Can't help but compare it to Vinci, and the comparison isn't all good, nor all bad. I'm not really into the fantasy theme and the graphic design hurts my eyes, but I do like the addition of the attack die and all the little expansions they've developed for the game. Hidden points and fixed rounds you can easily implement in Vinci should you choose - I've played Vinci with and without these tweaks for years. When all is said and done though the two games are very similar. It'll come down to a preference in theme and appearance for many gamers. I find the decline tokens in Small World hard to distinguish and prefer the playing pieces and board of Vinci. Theme wise I find it easier to comprehend what each civilization tile does in Vinci than races in Small World. I'm more than happy to play either game, but I prefer Vinci.

The simplicity, the combination of powers and choices make both Vinci and this the wonderful games they are. You have to look ahead and choose what combination will work best for you, where to bring it onto the board, how thinly you want to spread yourself out and defend versus how many victory points you want, and then when to go into decline. It's simply fun.

With hidden victory points it's the player who through one method or another manages to be hit the least will win the game. It's actually easy enough to keep a running count of the points scores, should you be taking it seriously, but who's doing that!? I find hidden points turns the game into a hit the perceived leader exercise instead of a hit the actual leader exercise. Players who like to table talk and con others will enjoy the hidden points. Who cares: Small World is not a deep strategy game, but rather gaming mostly for the social experience.

Light and tense multiplayer wargame in which the different bands have special abilities that change from one game to the next, and even in the same one.  Players try to expand with a race as much as they can, but when it can't give anything else from itself, they can put it into decline and start a new conquer with a new faction.

Hard for me to rate SmallWorld...
The point is: I think it is an excellent game in a category I don't like at all.
The reason why I never decline a game (this far) is because the game is really fun. But I hate when I don't understand why a player is attacking somebody instead of somebody else... when I play SmallWorld, I have to accept the fact that I don't play to win, but to have fun... and for me that's quite difficult! But I'm learning...

A good modern twist on a multi-player conquest game. The way the race/class abilities couple make this game pretty unique, sort of like a more controllable Cosmic Encounter. I generally don't enjoy deterministic combats, but here it works. It helps you figure out what you can do and not do very clearly. Losing ground is not back-breaking, and the semi-hidden VP works well since games generally have a couple players in the running for 1st, making it a tense finish for all but the most skilled information tracking players.

So much less abstract and more thematic than its predecessor. That's a good thing. I like Vinci, but this game is just more FUN. 

"I'm going in here with my Diplomatic Skeletons" or "...my Flying Tritons" is just flat-out better than saying, "I'm going in here with my...yellow." 

I was looking forward to hidden scoring, but now it's a game of who keeps their head down, or argues, best. So you're hitting the perceived leader rather than the actual one. I'm not sure I like that better than the way it was. 

I also think there's a huge advantage to going first in the last round, and a huge disadvantage to going last, as the people in that last round just domino down, hitting whoever is below them in turn order. That last poor schmuck will be lucky to have anything left on the board.

Bought in like new condition from BGG auction.  I like this game.  Only complaint is there is little player interaction between turns, down time can build up as other players decide what to do.  You need to pay attention to what your opponents are doing in order to maximize your own turns, but you have nothing to do while they go.  I do love the variety of  races and how the ability cards can randomize for every game to create some very unique and powerful factions.  Look forward to playing again.

Small World corrects a number of issues with Vinci, streamlines the rules, and snazzes up the theme and art.

The goal is gold! (Or victory points. They're one and the same.) You get gold by successfully managing a series of civilization through their rise and decline.

Each player starts with one civilization, expanding it across the map. At the end of your turn you gain one gold for each territory controlled by your civ. Each civilization is unique and may give you bonus gold for controlling certain areas, or make it easier to conquer certain territories. At some point, you may put your active civ into decline. A declined civilization loses its extra units, most of its special abilities, and can no longer expand, but it can still give you gold every turn.

You may only have one civ in decline and one active. Knowing when to decline is one of the big game decisions you make.  Each civilization is a complement of two tiles: a race and some characteristic. For example, Flying (characteristic) Dwarves (race) get +1 gold for controlling areas with mines, and can expand into any territory, not just adjacent ones. The combination of tiles also grants a starting number of civ tokens with which to expand. Generally, these tokens cannot be replaced if lost through combat. This accumulated attrition is what leads to your decision to decline.

You chose your next civilization from a queue of five. The civ tiles are randomly paired. If you decide not to pick from the top of the queue, you must put one gold on each civ you skip. The player who takes a civ also claims any gold on top of it. This provides a nice balancing mechanism as some combinations are clearly more powerful than others.

The game ends after a preset number of turns. Both the map size, and the number of turns, are dictated by and scaled to the number of players.

A great Civ game that can be played in about two hours.

I prefer Vinci for the real powers and geography. SW is basically the same game with fewer combinations as each power has one fixed ability and one random; is based in some mythical place and takes half the time. If Vinci had the production values of SW it would be far more appealing to the fickle audience who like 'shiny' things!
Also SW is far more expandable!

Small World has all the hallmarks of an Ameritrash classic -- pretty bits, variable player powers, aggressive territorial in-your-face conflict, a dash of pick-on-the-leader. The one thing from the genre that it's missing is the random element that allows one to gamble and hoot and holler and upset everyone's plans -- fighting is very deterministic, for the most part (although the addition of a last-gasp Reinforcement die does help with this a bit). Some will find the lack of Lady Luck to make the mix unpalatable -- not so for myself, but I certainly don't begrudge anyone who misses it.

Our five player game went 90-120 minutes and moved along at a pretty good pace. Plus, we had Pillaging Amazons, Diplomat Skeletons, and Dragonmaster Halflings. That's a Tuesday evening well spent, in my book. Scores were reasonably close despite groanings from certain corners of the table -- the spread was 90-75, I believe, making every victory "coin" spent on choosing a race valuable.

By and large I found Small World to not be a significant departure from its prior edition, Vinci. There are plenty of small tweaks, sure, and none that I could identify as hurting the design, but small tweaks they remain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The thing I've learned about Small World is that it gets better the more cutthroat the players are. When players are doing random things and trying to maximize their points in the short term, the game tends to be too random. When players are actively limiting their opponents options and scoring opportunities, the game becomes much more interesting.

The modular race and ability tiles give a good number of different combinations to increase replayability. But after a few plays, the game became rather dull. Only played 2-player games, so maybe more players create more conflict and tension that can make the game more interesting.

Very fun and not too serious game of conquest.  Nice and quick and players shouldn't feel too upset even when they get attacked, I mean your races only last 2 or 3 turns before needing to be killed off and when you're getting weak you just bring in a fresh batch.

Not too big a fan of the board (have subsequently got used to after more plays), but all the other bits are great, fantasy theme very well done, lighthearted, slightly comical and just fun.

Personally, I like Risk for the first half hour before becoming bored or frustrated - so this really hits the spot.

Even though I prefer the chaos and unpredictability of the multiplayer game - this works ok as a 2 player also.

Not bad at all. Very neat and humorous system to generate the factions, and the combat system is simple and clean - I don't mind the odd dice roll here and there but dice-fests (which this isn't) can be very tedious. The theme is not really my cup of tea and I must admit to finding the thing repetitive, with too much downtime, but there is a lot of good stuff here and the game is at least reasonably enjoyable for most - and should be a blast for many.

Qué decir del SmallWorld, un juego divertido, sin muchas pretensiones, con una duración ajustada, decisiones importantes que tomar y una interacción directa que, sin embargo, no produce "malos rollos".

No osaría calificarlo como wargame, pero sí es un juego tipo risk avanzado, al que puede jugar cualquiera.

En su contra, decir que las razas del juego básico se queman excesivamente rápido y, de hecho, ni siquiera son suficientes para cumplir la oferta según las reglas cuando juegan 5 jugadores.

I love these reworkings of old classics that make the game more balanced, more playable, more fun and more presentable. 

Small World is better than Vinci in many ways. I like the hidden-VP scoring, as you focus more on who's strong on the board (and who potentially will be strong) than who really is in front. The fixed game ending (10 rounds) makes it less chaotic and random to make decisions near the end of the game, and also gives players who are behind something to work for (maximizing their score by the 10th round). Also, it makes it more conducive to newbies, because they can focus on having fun, since they don't realize you're actually quashing them by 30 points until the end of the game, at which point they're ready to move on and conclude this is a fun game anyway. The player scaling is great with the maps. Vinci should have been designed for 2-5, like Small World is, since having many players just creates downtime. The reinforcement die is excellent because it mitigates one of the worst aspects of Vinci downtime: when somebody places all his tokens, finds he's 1 short of his plan, then decides to do everything completely different to see if he can do it in a different way, then tries again, then...

And I haven't even touched on the components. The zany, beautiful artwork means this game is usually filled full of laughter, which really helps to mitigate the hurt feelings that can come from the intrinsic nastiness of the Vinci/Small World system. My games of Vinci have been quiet, tense and "DAMN YOU!", whereas I don't feel that bad when I'm attacked in Small World. I'm too busy wondering what happened to my lone Halfling with the Flying Sorcerer (alien abduction + clone...ouch).

Small World has fewer combinations than Vinci, but I like that these combinations have more thought put into them through the stratification of race and power, as you sometimes get some weird civilizations in Vinci. It's also nice to see familiar faces in the races every game. What this takes away from the strategy space, Small World also adds. The 10-turn game length means it's actually viable to just decline once in the game, and try to use a long-lasting 2nd combo for the entire game. There are tiles that actually do this in Small World, whereas there was only one in Vinci.

90 minutes of playtime full of laughter, solid mechanisms. And this game is enjoyable by newbies and experienced players alike. 

The downside is that there is significant downtime, especially among score-optimizing players. This can be mitigated by playing with fewer players. The deterministic combat also means this game is more abstract strategy than Euro/War, and is best with 2 or 3.

4+3

I didn't think I would love this game and I was right.  I can see why I have had it in shrink this whole time.  The theme is ok, but the goofy combinations don't appeal to me.  The gameplay is so-so.  It's very fiddly considering what you are supposed to be doing and there is a lot of moving bits around to not accomplish a whole lot.  This one might be headed for sale after just one play.

RATING: 8
The game mechanism is very simple but still fun. 

In most cases there are enough good combinations of races and abilities to select from. Placing tiles is more or less routine and predictable. The strategic depth is therefore very limited. Maybe the only crucial aspect of your strategy is, when to give up your race and select a new one. But its still a nice, light area control game with a cute artwork.

Area control game with variable powers and abilites set in a fantasy world.

Pro: Components are great (as expected for a Days of Wonder). Variety in the combinations of Racial Powers and Special Abilities is great, and makes for ridiculously high replay value. Very simple mechanics, but still room for lots of strategy. Minimal luck factor.

Con: The game can drag horrendously in anything higher than 3 players - caters up to 5 (6 with a certain expansion), and games can last hours longer than necessary.

I'm already a fan (and owner) of Vinci who does not get to play it near as often as he would like.  Needless to say, there has been very little interest on my part in picking up a copy of Small World.  Despite that, I was interested in giving a whirl if the opportunity to present itself arose.

The best place to start seems to be the near legendary Days of Wonder production values.  Everything about the game, from the board to the counters to the storage tray, is top notch.  Just as would be expect.  However, as others have noticed, once game play starts, the board becomes a chaotic mess.  This is in stark contrast to the spartan and (to me) more utilitarian components of Vinci.  There was also some problem with the gray wash of the declining side of counters, particularly when looking at them from across the table.  For the most part, we were able to work with this.

As for the changes, I'm not overly enthused.  The hidden VP's I can take or leave.  I'm not really fond of how the races and abilities come back into the game once they leave.  While separating the races and abilities seems to work well enough, I prefer the method used in Vinci.  I don't feel like the 8 turn limit really works for five players.  It seems to place too much of a constraint on the game.  Granted, I think that forces you to be a little more careful about your timing as you are playing against a very hard wall.

My biggest gripe is the presence of a somewhat reverse kingmaker scenario.  What I mean is that in the final round, all other things being equal, it is much more to your benefit to attack the people that follow you in turn order as they are the only ones whose score you can affect.  This seems to give a pretty significant afvantage to those who go first.  In addition, there seems to be an advantage in the first turn of the game as well which falls to the first player as they get the best pickings for location.  These two things together seem to give too much of an advantage to the first player.  By its nature, there should be a similar problem in Vinci.  However, no one has ever commented on it like seems to happen with Small World.  I suspect that it substantially related to the strict turn limit.

Overall, though, there is nothing terribly wrong with the game.  I would play again if asked.  However, I would certainly prefer to play Vinci, so the rating on this one will be a little less.  Given that I don't play Vinci enough as it is, none of the changes are interesting enough for me to obtain my own copy.  It is, however, nice to see the system once more easily available.  Thank you Days of Wonder. [05/23/2009]

Very fun game with lots of fun pieces. Simple base rules, and each race/class combo lets you bend/break those rules a bit. Lots of direct conflict in the game, players have to take eachother out in order to expand themselves. Since there will inevitably be attacking in the game, the best way to win is to be undesirable to attack, or manage to convince others you are not in the lead (money/VPs are secret) so that they will attack someone else.
A few problems with some races/classes being vastly superior to others. Also, you can be completely taken out in the game, definitely a lot of room for smiting and king-making. Regardless, great game, almost always willing to play.

Small World -- Played once; four-player.

I've never cared for war games.  I can think of several reasons:
• Games are my escape from unpleasant realities (so war as a game theme fails for me -- I just don't enjoy the idea)
• I don't care for direct conflict.  I much prefer games where pursuing the goal does not involve player elimination, or even elimination of the players' tokens.
• I find it disheartening to play out a game when I've deployed my troops poorly, and now it's just a matter of making the motions until someone mercifully finishes off my remaining pieces.
• I've just never been good at war games.  (And while I usually enjoy games regardless of whether I win or lose, it's hard to enjoy a genre in which you feel hopelessly under-equipped intellectually.)

Small World is a war game even I can enjoy.  The fantasy theme ameliorates the associations with real war.  The conflict doesn't result in real elimination, since a player can just bring in a new race.  The ability to begin anew addresses my issue of disheartenment with playing out a position which has become unfun (if not untenable).  And while Small World [i]is[/i] strategic, its depth of strategy is within my range.

Furthermore, I happen to enjoy the lighthearted fantasy theme. The mix of racial abilities and special powers makes for fun choices when selecting races and provides varied gameplay over time.

RATING: 8.5
Initial rating after 1 play (came in last). 

The thinky conflict game. Interesting stuff, feels much deeper than the rules would suggest, definitely one I'd like to play more. It seems like an intuitive version of area control - adjacency matters, you also can do army manoeuvres like defence and fast board sweeps (although it's not fighting as such). There seems to be a lot of space to explore as the game seems to emphasise finding the best solution for each current situation. I do wonder how the game would feel with more experienced players and a bit of negotiation. (Made a mistake of ganging up on one player, whole the other two run away. Stupid, but will learn to do better). One last thing: because each turn matters the game might actually be heavier than let's say CITOW.

lowering rating because I couldn't force myself to buy the game (I intended to) and figured out it didn't leave a memorable experience. 

EDIT: playing it more and more lately. Good stuff.

I only own the app for the iPad but cannot stop playing this game. It works great as a "pass and play" when the AI becomes a not very tough challenge.
I know that I am limited to just 2 players on the app and that is a negative, but I can only imagine that the counting of tiles in the real game could be a drag. The iPad version makes this and the coin count a dream!
If it is not blasphemy to say this about an iPad app, it has been our Game of the Year.

Played once (with a couple of expansions) with 6P. Arguably the best thing in this cute game is the ability to put your race into decline. Given that it is a practically mandatory action to perform at least once throughout the game, choosing when to do so becomes a skill of careful timing and positioning. Having to deconstruct something that you've gradually built up is an amazingly organic concept which isn't seen much in other games, so Small World gets props for that too. The second best thing is the ingenious mix-and-match system of abilities and races, which uses humourous tropes and opens the game up to endless possibilities (of expansions, that is).

It is strange then that Small World doesn't quite click with me. The combat system is too calculative and sterile for my liking, and at odds with the zany artwork. My ideal combat-based game is an all-out dice-brawl, not just an abstract game with a die roll at the end as a kicker. And while the artwork looks great on individual components, the riot of colours once the game is in motion makes it difficult to read the board situation at a glance. Lastly, some combinations of races are much better than others. This is obviously a part of the game, but luck sometimes leaves you with subpar combinations.

The "hidden scoring" is inexplicable. The numbers are small enough that it's easy to keep an exact count in your head.

A solid improvement on Vinci, fixing one of my biggest problems with the game (king-making) and also simplifying things slightly ... but to the game's benefit.

[6 plays] This is Vinci redone well. I'm not big on fantasy themes as a rule, but this worked nicely for me. The chits and the board could be supplemented with a color coded player marker for clarity, otherwise I have nothing but praise for this remake. I've really enjoyed it both times.

Update 2013. I think I miss Vinci. The historical map and theme worked better for me and perhaps helped to disguise that this is really an extremely light wargame with very few meaningful decisions.

Vinci with a fantasy theme. Similar to Vinci, players draft races and use token to expand (ala the original Civ). Special powers require constant referring to rules sheet (which is too large) but also results in some hilarious race combinations.

Flying humans anyone? This one is Vinci without cohesion (which I liked), no bashing the leader owing to hidden VPs (making game more random) and more chaos (some powers are wacky!).

Still a fun romp. Will play again but will probably not buy since I own Vinci.

Small World is a little more confrontational than the games that we usually like to play, especially at the two player count. I think I would enjoy the game quite a bit more with 4 or 5 players, since then all of your attacks wouldn’t be directed at just one opponent. The multitude of different races and powers keeps every game from feeling the same, and we love the fact that it’s a Risk-esque game without relying on the luck of dice for your armies to conquer opponents. It occupies a place in our collection that doesn’t have many other games in it, and for that reason alone it sees a decent amount of play.

It works well with more or less than that as well, but with more players there's a bit too much downtime and with less players it just isn't as tense.

Note: Registered plays are since I registered this account at BGG, not total amounts of time I have played this game... you'd have to add about a dozen plays.

RATING: 7.401
It's surprising better than I thought it was going to be.  There seems to be a lot of replayability due to the variable matching of powers.

It's not exactly diceless combat, but it's very close.  However, it's really more of an area control game than a wargame, so it doesn't bother me quite as much.

Nice job Days of Wonder.

Boiled Down: It's Fantasy-themed Risk. That's simplifying a lot, but you really have to like Risk to like Small World. Incidentally, I'm not a huge fan of Risk. The randomization of the races and the mechanic of having two races, one of them in decline, makes it better than Risk, but still....I have to be really pressed to play this.

RATING: 3
The game sounds like a good idea, but ultimately is boring and repetitive. Best before 5 plays. The only meaningful decision in the game is when to go into decline and what race to pick, but this only happens maybe three times in the game. Conquest practically goes without saying. As in most eurogames, victory is determined by the discretion of the other players, i.e. try to always only receive the second most points!

This game is probably the only one where the die bugs me. Every turn you can practically risk getting -1 or +1 VP. Distributed amongst several turns, this can make a big difference, especially if you are able to hold for long a space you won with the roll of the die.

The graphics are nice though.

I'd rather try VINCI one day.

Szépen kivitelezett, területfoglalós játék. Vezess különböző fajokat minél nagyobb hatalomra, ha viszont fogy a birodalmuk nagysága, jókor dönts a hanyatlásuk mellett! Érdekes mechanizmusú, teljesen egyedi, változatos játék. Fajok és a tulajdonságok véletlenszerű párosítása miatt mindig más már az alapjáték is. Egyértelműen konfrontációs játék, de muszáj mindenkivel konfrontálódni, pontosabban, aki esetében úgy érezzük vezeti a játékot azzal mindenképpen.

I loved this game the first time I played it. More plays than I know how to count later, I still love it. I'm also impressed that anyone I've ever played this game with, love it. Even my friends who only like party games get into this one. My husband and I use this as a gateway game more than Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, or Ticket to Ride. They all seem to pick up on this one and ask to play whenever we get together.

RATING: 7
A very apt rebranding of a very nice game concept (Vinci), and a great gateway game with usual, fabulous Days of Wonder components. The characterisation of the races, even with the special abilities, is however still not enough to create the sense of story I need to be fully satisfied.

Turns are relatively quick, but sometimes can get bogged down with 5-6 players when people are new to the game. Ideal for 2-4 players. The theme and "Risk" type conquering makes this a great game to introduce people into hobby gaming that like either fantasy or strategy games. Days of Wonder is great at choosing "Gateway Games" to develop.

I am in love! It is so very brilliant - it is intense, humorous, short, great with both 2 players and 5, stunning artwork, simple rules... Very nice. Perhaps it will be a 10 someday. 
NOTE: After a year, reduced score to 9 (from 9.8). It is still brilliant, but once the novelty wears off, winning is almost too easy.

Not the most exciting game in the world, and I actually disliked it for a while. But it has grown on me as a game that I can play with a large variety of people (but the number of powers and races available at a time can still be overwhelming to newbies)

You do have to worry about downtime as you scale up, and possibly a game that isn't "exciting" enough to justify a kingmaking-rife FFA. Makes me sort of prefer it with 2 or 3 players, but Tales and Legends expansion spices up 4 player as well.

I've found "Small World" (even with all the expansions included) a bit on the simplistic side, but with its gorgeous presentation, fantastic art and varied races, it is a crowd pleaser.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Right off the bat this feels less abstract than Vinci, which is a good thing.  It is a much warmer design.  Sadly, while some of the changes are welcome (the new powers are fun, and the die is entertaining), most of the changes are, I think, a detriment to the game.  

The game is drastically shortened, so you don't get to see any real rise and fall.  The game plays so quickly that you can only take on two or three civs.  There is no clawing your way back into the game.  You just see what you can do with little, then add up the points at the end.  

I also hate the hidden points.  I thought I'd be a fan, but the system is set up to attack the leader, so people now gang up to attack the perceived leader rather than the likely real leader. So, the problem isn't gone rather made less efficient.

Still, it is an alright game.  I'll play it, but I'd rather play the original.

UPDATE: The more I play this the less I like it.  I think that attacking the perceived leader issue is too much of an irritant for me to enjoy.  I also have an issue with the last turn as turn order grants huge disadvantages to the players moving last as everyone just pisses down the line attacking those that are still going to score.  This could be solved by having one last scoring again after the final round.  

With the exception of the die, every change from the original game is inferior.

While the race & special power are interesting (most interesting part of the game I would say), the actual game play feels somewhat lacking. It felt like the decision of where to attack was obvious most of the time for each player given their race and special power. It's also very obvious when is the best time to decline a race. That means the most interesting and important part of this game comes to down which race to pick when one goes into decline, and you only get to do that two or three times in a 5p game, which could take a while between turns. I probably won't reject an invite to play this game, but will not suggest playing it.

This is a super fun area control game.  It's not just the game play mechanics that are fun, but the theme itself, along with the artwork, really add to it.

Though seemingly simple, the game has some depth. And though the game has some randomness (the races and powers get coupled up randomly each game), this did not detract from the game at all, even for my group of friends who really appreciate strategy games (with little or no chance factor).

The randomness of the races each game mixed with the unpredictability of each player really give this game some lasting appeal.

I found the first few games of Small World boring. Every round felt the same. Spread your guys out until most of them are dead and then go into decline. 

BUT, after playing with a group who knew how to play well I fell in love with the game. The strategy comes in when you are choosing your races. Do you start with a race that  can spread out quickly and then go in decline? Or do you start with a race that can stay fortified while in decline and then try to hold two races the whole game? 

I really would like to get some of the expansions.

This one has been sitting on the shelf for a while. Not quite sure why. Probably need to dust it off and give it a go. I suspect it is more confrontational that we typically prefer. Still worth revisiting if I can convince my wife to re-learn it.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 4er. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed. 

It's a simplified, streamlined, quickened Vinci, but it's still Vinci. Major improvements: faster play, hidden (but trackable) scoring, defined game length (9 or 10 rounds), more limited attribute combinations (always a race characteristic and something else). On the other hand, there is hidden scoring (why shouldn't you beat up on the leader?), and the graphic presentation was terrible: too colorful, too much artwork, too busy -- hard to easily see what's happening on the board. And the game seemed to end almost too quickly! I'll certainly play it again, but right now I think I prefer Vinci.

(Thanks 2009 BGG Secret Santa!)

Very interesting game.  It's relatively light, but there's lots of tough decisions and the flavour just oozes... it's hard not to get sucked in.  

Sure, sometimes the race/ability combos that come up for you kinda suck, but it's still fun trying to make lemonade out of the lemons.

Excellent stuff.

Edit 05/27/09: After 4 plays, I'm beginning to think the luck of the dice might result in too much of a point discrepency... in a game solely determined by VPs rather than actual territory, the spreads can be massive.

Edit 12/30/09:  16 plays... yeah, luck plays a big role, but the game's so good, so thematic, so FUN, it just doesn't matter.  Small World isn't the game you get hung up on trying to win, it's one you just enjoy playing.  A lot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A tentative rating right now.  I played Vinci once a few years ago and had a good time, though I only remember parts of it like the civ decline aspect.  I do enjoy this type of game, in one sense a light wargame, which I like, and also a light civ game, another type of game I enjoy.  However, the fantasy theme detracts from my enjoyment because it just doesn't resonate with me and means I have to keep referring to the charts and abilities.  In the game I played, we used the expansions too, so there were even more charts to look at.  For these reasons, I probably prefer Vinci, but I would like to play Small World some more and it's possible I might end up rating it higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the theme of this game and the mechanics are unique and fun.  A definite problem is that there are broken combinations of races and powers that can ruin a game so it could use a little more balance.  But besides getting stomped when I know it has more to do with luck of the draw than skill it's hard not to have fun with this.

Another game that scales well from 2-5 players, it comes with different boards of different sizes depending on the number of players.

Small World, 1 play, rating 7,5 
Of the two new games I played during July 2009 Small World was by far the best. I had it demonstrated for my at a Swedish con in three player setting and that game was fast and intense with many choices. Maybe a little bit to simplistic and the theme is not really my cup of the, but if someone bring it to a game session I would not whine, contrary I will enjoy the game.

BestWith:4>3>5,2. Use Larry Levy's Variant for 4 or 5 players: Choose races in reverse order starting with last player. (Player 5 can choose his beginning civ, using the normal rules, or he can pass. If he passes, Player 4 now has the option. This continues until one player chooses a civ, in which case Player 5 again has the option to choose or pass, or until Player 1 is reached, in which case he must choose a civ.) With this variant, the late players get the advantage of choosing their civs at the optimal moment, while the first players continue to get the advantage of placing first.

I liked it so much better than Vinci. Maybe I'll have to give Vinci another opportunity but I found this one to be much more interesting and with all the "view" aspects much better also.
I've only played Small World once but I liked the dynamics and the interaction with all the latent conflict.

Experience as in all games is part of the key for the success. The right timing for decline and a solid race/bonus combination are half way to achieve victory. Playable within one hour and with nice components this game is one of the best releases of 2009.

In my humble opinion, inferior to the game it reimplements. Yes, it's prettier (Vinci was, indeed, quite ugly), but Small World is more chaotic and not as tight as Vinci was (it's lighter and more family-oriented). I am sad they abandoned the first and developed the second.

"Small World" is nice, and I mean that in the best and worst meaning of the word nice. The theme is very open to politically incorrect jokes (which I actually count as a positive), the combos of races and powers can be quite fun and interesting but the game play doesn't get passed an okay for me. Something doesn't quite click with me and SW. We played with 5 and I thought the downtime til your next turn was too long, since there is not much in terms of strategy in planning (decisions are pretty obvious) I found myself a bit bored, maybe it should be kept tighter and only be played with 3-4. Still, light fun can be had with this one.

This works well as a filler.  Can have a problem with perceived leader vs. actual leader.  The more I play it, the more I get frustrated with situations that often come up in the game.  For one, there are certain race/class combos that are way overpowered and some are way underpowered.  Another is the fact that sometimes to take the leader down you end up hurting yourself in the long run and thus doesn't get you anywhere in the game. Recently played and the first player got Fortified Trolls, instant win.  This game seemed so great when it first came out, now I have really lost interest.  Hidden VPs lead to perceived leader bashing vs actualy leader bashing.  Just an outright annoying game now that I think about it.

Possessing excellent graphics, clean mechanics, and a whimsical but suitable theme, this is a stellar production.  This is the first non-dexterity euro that my son has picked up right out of the gates (although he does get light wargames quite readily).  He even won his second game with no coaching!  The playing time and power balance seems perfect for what it has to offer.  This is the game many people are looking for when they buy their nth iteration of Risk.

After playing, I can see what the fuss is about. This is so easy to pick up and there are a ton of player options, combine that with the playtime being fairly short and it becomes one of those "Let’s play again" games, that can make game nights drag into the early hours
EDIT: After 15 plays, it is not getting old.  I upped my rating from an 8 to a 9.  This is a crowd pleaser.  Low bar to entry for the casual gamer and enough depth to keep veteran's coming back.

Small World is [i]okay[/i], though definitely much worse than it is generally made out to be. The concept of race and ability combinations is the main selling point of the game, and is expertly implemented through the buying mechanism. The rest is unfortunately a bit underwhelming. What initially seems like a somewhat deep and strategical game, soon turns out to be quite shallow. The combat mechanism is quite elegant and works somewhat well, but it is much too simple. After you are done being impressed by the races and how they funnily combine with the abilities, you are left with a decent but ultimately uninteresting game.

Streamlined version of Vinci. The major differences are the different maps for different numbers of players and the 'fixed' way to combine races and powers. In Vinci, all civilization tiles could be mixed.

After 1 play, I think I still prefer Vinci by a small margin. It's cleaner, and I prefer open scores. Better to attack a real leader than a perceived one.

The best thing about Small World is how easily I can entice social gamers to play it. By social gamers, I mean people who normally shun games with conflict and competing factions.

Small World is very sensitive to the Magic Circle as defined in game design theory. A mismatch of skill and antagonism/pacifism can create an unpleasant game for all involved. When players are psychologically well matched, the game flows well and is quite enjoyable. I really enjoy this game with the "right" group. It feels like a root canal might when playing with players with different playing incentives. Specifically, one player can choose to target another player for some perceived insult early in the game. Both players are guaranteed to lose, but it makes the experience much less pleasant for all involved.

As long as we have the max number of players, everyone is skilled and playing hard, it plays well.  If 1 or 2 people are not paying attention, it ruins the whole game.  The reason is that everyone has to gun for the current leader.  If 2 people end up fighting each other and ignore some other player, that player can easily win with no effort.
I highly recommend adding in some of the expansions so that you don't reapeat races in the same game.

Highly addictive landgrab gameplay with strategic depth and, best of all, racial/super powers. Easy enough that newbies can win on their first game, but complex enough that practice will make a difference. Accessible and has the right amount of luck to keep the vets from sure victory and the newbies from certain defeat. My favorite part about it, tho, is the massive level of replayability due to the number of race/power combos. No game is ever the same, and that's the way it should be. 

Can be a little intimidating to new players at first due to the sheer amount of information to absorb, but the rules are essentially streamlined and when you've learned how to play as one race/power combo, you've learned how to play all of them. My only real complaint is the setup/pickup time required, but with the help of one or two other players that drudgery is hardly noticeable.

One of the first boardgames we started our collection with. Generally just play with the two of us as explaining and being familiar with the different abilities generally lose new players. After playing a dozen games or so we didn't have to look at the cheat sheets. Still one of our favourites when we feel like combatting each other.

I like Small World as a very light Risk alternative; the problem is that I feel like it hits that sour spot where you have enough control to feel engaged but enough randomness to feel cheated.

I'm interested in getting the Tales & Legends expansion to amp up the randomness -- less (illusion of) control -- at which point I expect mthe rating to increase.

01/2011: All expansions are fun, but I'd say Tales & Legends is the most interesting because of the short-term tactical element. It also helps create some sort of narrative.

Expansions: Cursed!, Grand Dames, Tales & Legends, Be not Afraid.

Update: got rid of it, Evo does the same but better.

RATING: 7.5
[DOW 2009 edition] {Fantasy civilization; card-drafting, dice-rolling, area-control; scalable}  Small world is a very good game.  It's well themed, interactive, tactical and fun.  It has a good design.  There are no over-powered combos, races or special cards.  There are many decisions in a game - which races to pick, which areas to conquer, when to decline a race, etc.  Each decision counts but it's not agonizing.  It supports both tactical choices and strategic planning.  Players have good control on the outcome and situations; yet, they can also take risk to score more points by using the reinforcement roll.  It is very crucial to decline a race at the correct moment.  A turn is usually fast, not much AP problem.  It is easy to learn the rules, although it takes some time to understand each race and special power.  It is a suitable for both families and gamers.  Highly recommended.

Similar to other DOW games, the components are very nice.  The 4 different boards for each number of players are very nice.  The player aids are handy. The information on the cards and board is effective.  The token tray is good.  Some people do not like the artwork but I find it interesting.  In all, everything is well produced.  Thumb up!

I was underwhelmed at first, as Smallworld is basically a straight forward area control game. But after a few plays it started to get me. The fun and tactical depth with this one come from all the different races and special powers which are combined randomly and make every game different. Very addictive.

RATING: N/A
Small World è un divertente, buffo e spensierato gioco di civilizzazione, nel quale 2-5 giocatori si affrontano per la conquista e il controllo su una mappa che è semplicemente troppo piccola perché tutti abbiano il loro spazio! Scegliendo la giusta combinazione tra le varie razze fantasy e poteri speciali unici, i giocatori devono espandere i loro imperi- spesso a scapito dei loro vicini più deboli. Tuttavia devono anche sapere quando abbandonare la loro civiltà, ormai giunta ai limiti della sua crescita, nel declino e portarne una nuova alla vittoria.

Elenco elementi di gioco:
2 Mappe, stampate su due tabelloni a doppia faccia
14 Razze Fantasy con i rispettivi vessilli e segnalini 20 cartellini Potere Speciale Unico
10 Tane dei Troll
6 Fortezze

I guess if you bid for turn order this game is OK, but it's clearly not balanced as a "random first player" game.  And yes, you can balance it in-game by hammering on the first player, but shouldn't there be a more elegant solution than that?

That aside, it's a cute game (much like its predecessor) but largely plays itself.  The optimal point-scoring moves on any given turn tend to be self-evident, and the game can easily come down to whether a player brings in a new race HERE or THERE.

So, fun, but hard to attach much meaning to the results unless you're willing to politic relentlessly to improve your position.  I'm too old for that.

Attractive fun game which works well with the new theme. Not quite as grown up and mature as Vinci, but more accessible, and more fun. Who doesn't want to play a game with Commando Halflings, Flying Giants, and Mounted Amazons. The variable game boards are a great idea, and the two player game works (more or less).

Note - After about 10 plays, this turned into the same game over and over and over and over and... well, you get the idea.

RATING: 7
Like Risk.  Throws out most of the die rolling, which I agree was time consuming.  Race declining, as opposed to gaining units per turn, is its twist to the Risk system of play.  I wanted their to be more flavor with the fighting instead of just a simple [2+(units occupying)+terrain defense] to conquer algorithm.

Excellent remake of Vinci.  Slightly more chaotic due to the introduction of dice rolls (which play a minor part).  Rules are just a little streamlined and slightly more elegant.  Private scoring is an improvement.  Very pretty bits make the board perhaps a little harder to read but I still loved it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Liveily, clever game that cloys a bit after a while as one victory after another comes as a result of someone kingmaking one player and/or making a whipping boy out of another. Shouldn't be played reiligiously, but well worth breaking out once in a while. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Vinci never managed to get to the table very often, so this 'never mind the budget' reworking that removes a few rough edges and slaps on a few layers of cosmetics might have more success. Some of the ergonomics have changed for the worse, but not to a disastrous extent.

Update: two plays when released, then nobody has mentioned it for a year. Glad I didn't buy a copy.

Two years on, and another play. Actually quite enjoyed it. Rating improved.

 Great game, huge replay potential just with the core set, not to mention alll the add-ons. beautiful to look at and extremely tight, well tested rules. doesn't work as well with 3 players imo as one player (invariably whoever was last to choose their race) tends to get cut off by the other two who then sit and build up points, though even this has produced lots of interesting games.

I received this game for my birthday back in May 2010 and we have yet to even punch out the pieces. However, I recently downloaded the iPad app and can confidently say that this is the best new board game I have played for quite some time. Gameplay is a satisfying mix of random and deterministic mechanics. The variations in racial powers and abilities make it highly unlikely that any 2 games will turn out the same, the placement and combat rules are satisfying and in my experience so far don't lead to too much downtime due to analysis paralysis. There's even a smidgen of dice rolling thrown in for some drama. Outstanding! 

As much as I like this game it doesn't hit the table because of long setup and play time. There are too many components and I much prefer to play on the iPad.

The theme and hidden victory points were improvements to me over Vinci, and I have found the games generally tense and fun.

A few nits though - 

a) Takes too long to set up and pack up, some of the pieces are difficult to identify when in decline, and the tile holder that comes with the game is annoying (constantly getting a couple tiles stuck in it.)

b) The three player version does little to overcome the common problem with 3 player games - i.e., kingmaking by virtue of the first attack.

The races are interesting in their versatility and allow for some "surprise" moves and sneaky plays.  The decision of whether or not to decline is not always cut and dry, which is nice.  And the game plays rather quickly without unnecessary downtime (at least with up to 4... maybe not with 5).  Enjoyable, but we'll see if I'm still playing it in a year.

RATING: 5.75
Interesting game of back and forth, but it has no secret combat element which makes it fairly straight forward. Also, if you get a good race / ability combo you'll often never decline which makes the game really boring (Bivouacking Elves).

First game: I got Commando Dwarves and got a few points before being overrun by Mounted Ghouls and Swamp Halflings. Then I picked up the Bivouacking Elves and made a fortification along the bottom of the map, collecting between 8 and 10 points a turn. The combination of encampments and the fact I couldn't love units ment I had a high attrition value. The Stout Skeletons and Flying Amazons couldn't attack me without giving up land to each other. This ultimately let me just sit there and rack up an average of 9 points a turn by doing nothing. The game ended with me getting 85 points, second place had 84 points, and last place had like 75 points.

I wish there was an expansion that added a secret element, like hidden cards that you could play to help or hurt battles or break the rules unexpectantly. Would make the game more interesting.

Want to try again with 4 players and maybe open VP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I love this game. I smile whenever I get a really funny or interesting race/trait combination (Merchant Skeletons? Better be wary of their wares...), and I really think the "declining" mechanic is interesting. This was a 9 or 10 for me, but having played it dozens of times it has lost a little of its luster. Also, I can't find many people who want to play it with me.

Fun game of conquest.  I love the variety of races and powers, and gameplay is fast and dynamic.  I'm not convinced hidden VPs is such a good thing, however; I don't like the 'whine' element of the game.  Reference sheet has some flaws, and there are some confusing powers.

Hint for keeping track of who is in the lead: Keep a mental count; assign a player 1 point when they score 10 or more in one turn, -1 if they score 5 or less.  Count a 15 or more as 2. Then track the score by placing your VP tokens in piles. Gives you a rough estimate without needing to track exact values.

Sometimes you just need to cut loose, let your hair down, and slaughter everything in front of you. So you can load up the Playstation or you can pull out Small World.

RATING: 8
Conquest game with several different interchangeable races and special powers, which provide the game with variety and longevity due to the ever changing combinations between the two. The key to success in Small World is knowing exactly how far to extend your race across the board and when to put them into decline (it's very tempting to keep a race going for just one more turn). Knowing which races work best with which special powers also proves to be advantageous, although some races/powers seem to be stronger than others no matter what they're paired with (I'm decidedly unimpressed by the dwarves for example). It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, which means there's a lot of fun to be had when playing and one game invariably leads to several others in a session.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cool game, while the variety of the powers and races are interesting, the combat system is not. My main gripe with this is somebody should stop the player who's winning right now, but it really should never be you because it minimizes the number of points you make that turn, so it becomes about convincing everybody to stop the guy who's winning so you can swoop in and get YOUR POINTS! Also, you win with points. How exciting.

Laura's Rank (3/15) – 3 out of 5. Pros: I like the artwork and setup. I like the theme. There are tons of different ways it can play out because of the combinations between the special powers and races (which could be a bit of a con too). Cons: Even though you are attacking, there is not a lot of player interaction. Not really sure how you are doing relative to other people, so it's less exciting than many other games.

Ryan's Rank (3/15) – 4 out of 5. I love the variable races and powers. The game is a whimsical game that is easy to teach to most people. I didn't think it was boring or anything. It was less intense than some other games, but the fantasy themes and races was enough to keep me entertained and watch carefully.

Nice game to play for a family game, a bit too many races and special powers. After a while you realize they don't do much of a difference. There's almost no strategy involved; all you need to do is figure out who has the most money and attack that player. Expansions only bring in more races and powers and there's no way you can fit them in the original box anymore.

I like the idea of controlling more than one race and is definitely a much nicer and funnier game compared to Risk; I just wish there was more strategy involved.

A slick, modern strategy game. Fixes a lot of the problems of Risk to create scalable, grand strategy with the pacing and clarity of more casual games. The decline mechanic by which a player cycles through "races" is a nice little gimmick that is well exploited and really, really fun.

Super fun light "wargame".  Plenty of strategy with the huge number of race/power combinations.  Dwarves aren't "broken"... they're designed that way.  It's called a choice.  Stop whining and get over it, children.

I wish I had gotten this game much earlier. It's got the tension found in Evo, but much shorter and much more interactive. 

The special powers and races make for a lot of variety, but don't over complicate the game.

This feels like the Dominion of board games, easily expandable and plenty of combos to keep players interested for many plays. Plus it's very simple to teach.

RATING: 6.5
I cant help the feeling that this should have rather been a great little filler than a big game. The area control part is almost too simple to be fun. There is usually one move that is clearly the best.
The race/power selection just makes the whole thing way more complicated than it needs to be. I agree that the race/power selection is an interesting and meaningfull decision, but this makes for two to three decisions throughout this 60-90min game...

I *like* this game, though it is probably a little simplistic and repetitive. Timing your declines is the most important 'tactical' aspect of the game.

Interesting game.  I liked it, it was definitely fun and an interactive game.  I'm unsure of exactly how many plays it will be good for though.  Replayability seems to be a concern to me, although every game is different.  It seems to me that even all those differences will start to feel the same very soon.

I wish it would have had a modular board perhaps.  That might have increased it with me.  But this way, the world will always be the same.

++ amazing idea of building random combinations of races with additional properties
+ fantasy theme
- game balance can be off because some races or race-property combinations are much more powerful than others
- the very warlike theme is not for everybody
- artworks too childish

It reminds me of a Risk variant with simplified combat.

It's such a simple game (relatively speaking), but somehow it is incredibly re-playable and enjoyable every time.  To describe it as simply as possible, I describe it as "Like Risk, but actually fun."  The variety in the race/power combos and takeovers that only rarely require die rolls, but are almost always absolute keep this game really fresh.

RATING: 7
Played it a tons of times online. The app is not the best, but the game provides quick fun - there is no setup time after all. My major issue with Small Worlds is that it is extremely luck dependent and there are some unbeatable combos, like the were-elves, while others can be pretty useless, like the imperial white ladies. Another issue with the game that it does not scale well - you need four to six players in order to make it possible to compensate for some of the luck-dependent unbalanced combinations mentioned before. After more than a hundred games I can still recommend the game, even though, I was not ever really enthusiastic about it.

OMG!!! where to put the turn marker crown in the box??? :D
it looks gorgeuos, so i can show it to everyone but won't even try with my non-gamers friends... you have to learn all races and abilities for a smooth gameplay. i fainted of the spoonfedly rules which still leaves you with bunch of questions...
it was difficult to distinguish and recognize all your declining region from others since all the tokens are grey.. need good memory
a 2 and a 4-player game so far... i want to like it more

Nice game. Interesting with the decline. You must know when yor civilisation reaches the maximum and change to a new one. 

The board is maybe too colourfull. Problem with 5 players is too much downtime (specially, when 4 plays the first time). And its easy to eliminate a player. I think with 4 players, who know the game it would be very good, light family game, with muck interaction.

Nice components, box insert, theme & artwork! Very fun and dynamic game to play, easy to pick up and it's more than a light game can offer! 

However further expansion of characters and special abilities must be needed to keep the game fresh and to increase replay-ability, because most of the combos are easily repeated after a few game play.

RATING: 6
15 June 2009: When I first heard about it, I thought A) Fantasy-themed, b) Simple Wargame. C) Based of Vinci, which is a highly-regarded game. Thought it would be fantastic.

Now that I've played it, it's a lot lighter than I originally thought it would be. Basically identify your optimal scoring moves during your turn and perform them. Very tactical, and not very strategic.

Jonathan insists that I should try Vinci which is a different beast to this. Will have to give it a go.

RATING: 8
A mechanically great re-implementation of Vinci. Like any multiplayer combat game, Small World has kingmaking (lessened from Vinci by hidden VPs), meta-gaming, and headbutting, but it also has challenging and entertaining mechanics.

The graphic design is poor. Races cannot be distinguished quickly, especially in decline. Heraldry and national flags provide hundreds of years of examples of good practice in such design. Small World isn't the only game to botch this easily executed task, but it's one of the worst offenders.

The first two race/power expansions are good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Two words "Risk Killer"  It solves many of the problems with Risk, feels like Risk, but has a better theme than Risk.  The exciting combinations of races and powers also add to this games replayability.  Seriously, this deserves to be on your shelf.

3/20/17 Update: I have bumped this from an 8 to a 9, I have had the game for quite a while now and still love it.  Our last play reminded me of just how good a game it is without as much worry/stress as a game like Risk.  As simple and fun as you can get while still preserving strong tactical elements.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Loved it, was really easy to grasp the rules, played like the first few rounds of Risk before it starts sucking.  The whole verb/race system is brilliantly done, it adds unique combinations and insures each game/choice is a little different.  The area control is fun, but admittedly feels a little stunted, and the choice when is best to put a race into decline is sometimes a tough choice to make.  Other then that, the art is great, the pieces are great, the theme is great.  The board that modifies itself based on how many players you have is also nice to see.  All round an enjoyable experience, something I'm absolutely buying the expansions for.

You conquer and build your empire just to put it in decline and start over with a new race. I don't get it. Small cardboard pieces make it fiddly.

I like the system where you can pay with victory points to get a race you prefer over the first choice. But other than that, I would expect this game to have more thinking involved and tough decisions. Too much work for what you get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.9
Small World kind of feels like it drives itself. The only real decision is whether any of the available adjective/race combinations are broken enough that it's worth abandoning your current push. That said, I played only 1v1, but I can't imagine it gets any deeper with more players, just more chaotic.

So far have just played with 2 players. I like the game and the different abilities of the classes and races combined, though sometimes it can become a bit number crunchy for me. I often feel like the optimal choice is solvable. And while there is some fun in solving that puzzle it has boiled down to a mental exercise of maximizing my point lead in some cases. With more players the ability to solve several players turns will likely go away and will make it more heuristic based and more smooth.

I was very sceptical at first. It seemed like a poor copy of "Britannia" and "Barbarian, Kingdom & Empire" with a tacky fantasy theme.

Boy was I wrong!

This game is great! The tacky theme works perfectly with the variable special powers - it wouldn't have been credible without the theme. The game system is simplicity itself, the components are top notch, replayablilty seems virtually endless, it plays fast, it has special maps depending on the number of players...

My guess is this one will hit the highest grade in due time.

I'm trying to find something negative to say about it, but right now I'm drawing blank.

RATING: 7
I know it's just a remake of Vinci - but I like the theme (which doesn't feel too pasted on), and the various board sizes tuned to the number of players keeps things competitive.  I like it with 3 or 4 players, but with 5 the downtime between turns just seemed a bit too much for me.

Random race/power combos make for good replayability, but also increases the luck factor quite a bit. An expansion or two really adds to the variety. Scales nicely from 2 to 5.

Tried three-player game. Some abilities seemed to not work very well with limited number of players.

Small World does an excellent job of masking a fairly light strategic (yet filled with enough randomness to give everyone a chance) under pieces that scream "Friendly, straightforward game".  It's like it's making a joke of the theme, which makes it easier for me to introduce people to it, and they always have fun and often request a repeat play.  Kudos.

The game itself is an ok update to Vinci, with lots of expansion etc. My problem with this game is the garish art design is hard on the eyes. 

Also, this is one of those games that is pretty un-interesting when it is not your turn. There is nothing to do (except lobby that someone else should get hit) on other player's turns, so there can be a fair amount of downtime.

Fun contest for territory control. The most interesting decision is when to retire your race, and what to choose for your new race.

Vinci is one of my favorite games, and it came as no surprise at all that I very much enjoy Small World as well.  Once I get a couple more plays of this under my belt, I expect that it will rise to a 9.  I like the fantasy theme, and some of the changes make things easier to figure out, such as add 1 attacker for each "thing" in a region.  This is a great "attack and be attacked by anyone" game, it should appeal to Risk junkies.

Started with a few 2 player sessions, then a few 5's and a few in betweens. For a light-hearted, fairly quick-paced game, the 5-player sessions dragged. I think 3 or 4 player is the sweet spot. My son complains that 2-player is too predictable. Although accumulated wealth is kept somewhat secretive, it was fairly obvious by the middle rounds who had the best chance at victory and who had no chance. Board gets quite busy with tokens everywhere (it's a small world, after all!). Somewhat difficult to determine token ownership when races are put into decline due to relatively similar muted shades (although the small symbol on the back of each token is supposed to help). I like the game, though, and it works well when playing with a mix of kids and adults. I would say minimum age for the kids to understand and keep interest would be around 9-10 YO. YMMV.

I really like this game, but rarely get a chance to play. You can play with 2, but I've rarely had a great time with it, and with 5 it can be (but not always) a bit longer than I'd like. That said, the components are cool, the races/abilities add TONS of replayability to a fun game, and due to going into decline, you can come back with a new race to save your game if you get beat down. That said, if you mix getting attacked and not choosing the right time to go into decline, or get beat up on by everyone else, the game can be kind of a bummer. Despite a few holes (none too big), the components and replayability make this a great game for many
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Really funny game. Feel the fantasy/comic atmosphere without difficulties, fast/easy to learn but hard to become a "pro". Maybe if the players don't like fantasy things, this is the worst boardgame ever, but, the other side of the coins says that if you are in love with Hobbit and Elves, you can not be in love with this game. Pacifical Orcs or Berserk Fairies are priceless to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game, but there should be more races in the set. In a 5 player game it can easily happen that only 3 or 4 combinations are available at the end of the game and you will see some race twice during one game (but the race will most likely have another special power the second time)

I particularly like the 'decline' mechanic in SmallWorld, as well as the streamlined combat. The interesting combinations also make for a good level of replayability. Feels a bit simple with a fair bit of downtime (it seems that on a player's turn he or she is accomplishing way too much for one turn) but fun nonetheless.

Originally played as iOS.  Such an upgrade to have the actual board game.  Manipulating the pieces, learning all of the ways the races and powers can interact and physically flinging off your opponent's pieces are so much more satisfying than on an iPad.  What a great game.  Was able to teach it to my son (then subsequently be beaten) in an afternoon.

I like this one.  I have trouble with attacking other people, instead of just the Lost Tribes, but it can be a fun game.  It can also be long, but I do like the fun of mixing the races and powers.  I won, once, with a totally useless race that everyone passed over the whole time, by grabbing its giant stack of coins on the last turn, by planning my decline properly.

I love the idea of the game, and the production values are great, but it just doesn't deliver a totally satisfying experience. It feels really exciting and full of potential when you're selecting a race. After that, though, the gameplay is often perfunctory and anticlimactic.

Played and enjoyed this before Small World Underground, and really enjoyed it. Some time later I played it with a couple of the expansions thrown in.

I've played Small World a number of times, and never had a "bad" time, but I think the part of me that loves to build things up (cities, factions, etc.) hates the transience of factions in this game, and also setup and cleanup time seems to take forever, especially if an expansion is used.

This game is enjoyable like Risk (world domination, invade and leave troops behind), but capped the play time and doesn't allow a roll over victory. People don't tend to stay at the top for long, making it anyone's game even with a strong beginning and the last round can still make the difference between first and last. The game also gain much replay value by the mix and matching or races and abilities to your troops.

This left me kinda cold - I couldn't get past the "glorified Risk" feeling while playing this. Has probably the silliest artwork ever - I don't understand why this style was chosen when the humour content of the actual game is almost non-existent, I would have preferred this either with a serious theme or. in case of the slapstick style, with more fun elements and random chaos. As it is I'm not very impressed.

It's a quicker, luckless version of Risk. I do enjoy having to decide between the best race/power combos available, and also that time around turn 4-5 when you have to decide to decline your race or let it ride for one more turn. That said, the game is very simple and easy, and for that reason it may find its way onto my trade block even though I do enjoy the game. Would make for a solid gateway game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good. It's easier on the eye than Vinci and nicely produced. The addition of the races is really good. Had our first play but messed up a rule with reclaiming your own casulaties back in your hand when conquering. We put them back in the tray - and thus there were  not enough bods to sustain a civilisation for very long. Otherwise it was good and I look forward to playing this again and amending my rating if necessary. Lighter feel than Vinci and I'm not sure yet whether that's a good thing or not...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The replayability of Small World is probably pretty high given the huge nouber of possible combinations of race and magic powers. The game seems fairly well balaced and plays very quickly. While simplicity is one of the charms of the game, it's sometimes easy to the point of almost becoming a bit dull - the choices players have typically just arn't all that difficult. And even with hidden victory points, there's still a big element of bash the leader ... or, more accurately, bash the perceived leader ... which typically is a turnoff for me. Ultimately, this game is one that is interesting and quick enough that I'll play if people request it, but it's not one that I absolutely love or will suggest myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The first two times I played Small World it was either a 2 or 3 person game. I just played it with 4 players - twice, back to back - and it is clearly better with 4.  I love the mechanic of deciding when to let your race go into decline and then pick another faction to go with.   This kind of creative and (to my knowledge) unique approach is really nice to find in a game.   Upgraded my rating after the 4 player game.

Small World is fun.  Be prepared for a lot of maintenance, as there are dozens of tiles flying on and off the board every round.  It is deliberately claustrophobic--which is fantastic--but in the tightest of moments it slithers out of its theme and feels like an abstract painted in a blizzard of colors.  It's a sensory assault.

Is this suppose to be a Euro or a War Game? Really it's not much of either. It's also not much fun. 

The map is cluttered and lacks any distinctive features or need for tactical game play. 

Your army is constantly shrinking. The most armies you will ever have is on the first turn of a new race. 

Conquering new territories is extremley unsatisfying as it's pretty basic in the fact the larger number always wins. 
4 armies vs. 7 armies forget about it you have no chance .... the larger number always wins. 

It's unsatisfying as a Euro as you have very few meaningful decisions. 
You play like 9 rounds and the most important decision you will make is what race/ special ability you will select. 
You do that twice maybe three times a game. So you make at the most 3 big decisions. 

Don't get me started on all the bits and the stupid insert that holds them. It's a chore to take races in and out of the insert. ... 

Overall it's more like work (tedious and monotonus) that gaming (fun).

The good: It's reminiscent of Cosmic Encounter in that it's a simple ruleset and the players each have their own rule-breaking races.

RATING: 7
Really fun area-control game that is quite accessible.  I especially like the low luck factor, and the way races and special abilities combine to create near limitless variety each play-through.  It's easy to learn, and a first-time player can be competitive right away.  The boards look amazing, and I love that it comes with 4 different size maps!  All territory control games should do that!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Area control through numerical superiority, plus variable player powers in hundreds of combinations. What I wanted from Cosmic Encounter the first time I played it. Best with more than two players.

Every race/power expansion just makes the game better.

Plays include all race/power expansions owned at the time of the play.

RATING: 7
Having never played its predecessor, I cannot comment on comparisons to Vinci.  I do know that it is extremely simple, very streamlined, and nearly completely devoid of luck.  

On a side note, this game will be a cash cow for Days of Wonder.  For a company that has worked the expansion/upgrade angle for many of their hit games, Small World will line their pockets for a long time--new races, abilities, little plastic race markers....  Why not just issue two editions out of the gate--one with plastic, one without?

Not something I'd always want to play, but it is very fun. The game is pretty light but still has some interesting decisions, especially when picking races. The decline mechanism is cool but tends to feel very scripted in practice, the limited number of rounds means you almost want to decline at roughly the same time. Perhaps some sort of randomized round limit could alleviate this.

I played this game twice the first night I was exposed, felt like I loved it, bought it later that week.

I played over 30 games over the coming months. Didn't win a single one. I couldn't even tell you why, goodness knows I usually master games hard and fast, but I SUCK at Small World.

Since it impacted my enjoyment quite heavily, objectivity is hard... I feel like there were balance issue, but since I can't win with anyone, how OP could they really be, I guess? There's a lot of variation and complexity, but is also simple to learn or teach... all hallmarks of a good game, typically? Again, hard for me to be objective though... assume a bit higher rating for how you'd be likely to evaluate it....

Not something I reach for all the time, but a fast, straightforward and entertaining brawl all the same.  The variable powers keep things interesting, there's room for clever play while still being accessible to newbies or non-gamers, and including different maps for different player counts was a nice touch.  
Those who claim it's "not a wargame" have never been buried under a rolling wave of Berserk Amazons.  And those who claim it's "not a ConSim" should be chastened for dishonoring the memory of all the brave Forest Tritons who gave their lives in the War of the Rolling Wave of Berserk Amazons!

A game of area control similar to Risk, although on a smaller scale. Combat is dice-driven and the theme is of a fantasy nature. The artwork is done quite well.

Liked this quite a bit more than expected. The different combinations of abilities is fun and the gameplay is simple.

I did have a couple of negatives. It feels really dependent on keeping your opponents in check, so a bad play from one person can result in unintentional king-making. Also it felt too limiting. You can only place so many tokens, so decisions are mostly fairly obvious.

Still, it was fun and I would play again.

(after 1 two player game, rating could change) Didn't like it as much as ik thought I would because it didn't have this natural flow. I spend until have of the rounds explaining all of the rules, and to play it effectively you should know about all races power, and special abilities to choose from. Truth is, if you spend trying to explain em all, it slows the game down and they will feel like it's too complicated. If you don't explain, they feel like they're just doing stuff. I think it could be better though, if everybody knew the game, and if you play it with more people. But I'm afraid it will never get that far. explaining it to more than 1 person at a time seems daunting, and the one I already explained it to showed little intrest in playing it again someday. Seems like a pity though...

Good fun, relatively light conquest game.  The amusing combinations which can come up with the races makes for a few laughs, although I am rubbish at picking the best ones.

Small World is super fun, with zany race and ability combos.  Where it gets less fun is the amount of time spent tallying coins and waiting for other players to make moves.  It can feel like a very mechanical process of just waiting, doing math to tabulate gold gains, and then more waiting.  That being said, the choice of race, the interactions between players attacking and being attacked, and the choice of when to go into decline all play out fantastically.

I ran extremely hot and then rather cold on this game. For starters I really loved both the race combinations and the simplicity of the combat. Knowing that taking a territory was just # of items + 2 was super simple and easy. I also liked the different board sizes to balance player count. As I ran colder on it more aspects of the game struck me as unfun. For example, the idea of decline and picking a new race is cool in theory, but in practice it means that many turns your "action" was just flipping over a bunch of chits and picking out new ones, it was kinda a killjoy for a concept that the game was based around. Also the board got really hard to read for someone with bad eyesight when there were a bunch of in decline races on the board. It was very important to see them, but the "declined" colors were very faded. Also the ability to scoop up and redistribute as needed seemed to remove some of the tactical aspects to me.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very entertaining at first, toying with all that cool racial combos like flying dwarves, corrupt halflings or diplomatic cobolds, but its appeal fades pretty quickly. Chaotic and unpredictable free-for-all action forces you to juggle the needs of performing well and being an unattractive target to attack. Unfortunately, kingmaking trumps any tactic or strategy, and it is completely possible to ruin the day for particular player.

Bonus: This game is very attractive and it's easy to have a good time even in the first session, so it's great for novice players.

But, it's breeziness, quick playing time, and vast array of possible combinations and powers for the races made it much more enjoyable than I'd have thought.

The whole "is it a wargame" question comes up here, and I think those who said "hell no" have more of a point here than they often do in those types of arguments. It's more area control, sure, but at the highest possible level of abstraction and the highest level of simplicity, I still think a case could be made that this does qualify as a wargame, albeit one with a fantasy theme and one which is clearly aimed at non-wargamers, kids, and for introductory purposes for someone who has no concept at all of conflict over territory.

Can't go wrong with this on your shelf.  Doesn't get much play for me, because I go for heavy worker placements, but this is a fantastic entry level game and something I will pull out if I don't feel like dumping tons of brain cells into strategy and I just want to have fun.

It's easy to see why this has a broader fan base than Vinci - Days of Wonder production is excellent as always, the use of races and traits is more seamless than Vinci's characteristic combos, counting the number of pieces of cardboard to determine defense strength is so much more intuitive than remembering a handful of rules, and ending after a fixed number of rounds makes the issue of timing your decline more clear (for better or for worse).

Not one of my favorite genres because of the bash-the-leader tendencies, but still something I'm willing to play.  I do still prefer some of the elements of Vinci, but don't know if it will make the table now given Small World's popularity.

This is an area control game that doesn't rely on dice with a fantasy theme. What more could you ask for? The variability is great because of the mechanic which randomizes the matching of races against special powers. Each combination is unique and adds a twist to the game. This game is great for those new to board games as it's very accessible while still maintaining solid tactical elements. It also makes for a great family game (my 6 year old daughter loves it). It plays well with two players, but admittedly I got bored of 2 player games on this after the first dozen or so.

This is a fun party game, and there's a little bit of strategy involved.

One of the most boring games I've ever played along with Carcassone, Dominion, and games you'd buy from Walmart(Monopoly, checkers etc.).
It's like Risk for idiots. There is no game here.
You lay down tiles and then pick-up tiles then do it again. 
Would have traded for a beer. 
It only gets a 3 because its pretty but you'd expect that from a game aimed at pre-schoolers.

Another of those games that I consider good introductory games. I call it Risk, but Fun. (Just not to people who I know will be turned off by the "r" word). I like how it comes with different board sizes that always help force conflict and the fact that you end up with different combinations often and you have to guess which are going to work well make this a fun, fast, and kind of silly game to play.

Fun game and very colorful (not sure if i like the colors or not) It's very light with very light strategy and would consider it an entry level game at that level but it takes to long for an entry level game.

The fixed turn and hidden points was all I needed to sign up to play this one.  I liked Vinci, and thought the decisions were neat, but didn't actually enjoy the gameplay because of the end game.  So this is a big plus.  The assigning names to the powers does add fun and silliness to the games which is much appreciated.  I have a personal disdain for "lighter" family style games that implement fantasy themes because light games I can play with non gamers, but the fantasy theme crushes that thought.  

I think the size of the 4 player map is perfect, while I enjoy the extra turns and the extra control and cycling of the three player game.  Its a quite enjoyable experience when this gets played, but the I don't sit around daydreaming about strategy the following day like I do with my favorites.

RATING: 7
It's a world of SLaughter after all. Another great addition to the DoW line. This company really is quite particular about the products they choose. This one has more depth than some of their line so a "gateway" might not be a good term perhaps this is a bridge game. The tactical nature of the game is there but it's very accessible.

UPDATE: Having now played Vinci which I own, this one is definitely the junior of the two games. I'm definitely more attracted to Vinci. I only wish the map scaled like SW does for fewer players. Still SW is more accessible than Vinci and easier I think for new players to understand. However the games are SOooooo much alike (nearly the same game with only a couple of rules changes) so there's really no need to have both.

Unlike most games which go down hill for me after a few plays, Small World has been growing on me with each successive play. I started off not being particularly impressed, but then played it again and liked it a bit more, and then a little more after the third play, etc. Now I've played it 5 times and just purchased a copy. Strangely enough, it was the announcement of the fan-designed expansion contest that ultimately prompted me to buy the game. I found that the fan-designed expansion contest worked very well for the Mr. Jack Extension, so was hopeful that it would be just as successful for Small World. The greatest appeal of Small World comes with the many possible combinations of races and special powers, so the addition of even more races and special powers to increase the number of combinations significantly is a very welcome addition for me. I'm particularly happy with the fact that Days of Wonder included four different boards to accommodate two, three, four, and five players. Being someone who is picky about the number of players in a game, it's very nice for a publisher to acknowledge that different player counts require different boards, rather than just turning a blind eye to that reality and slapping as broad a player range on the box as remotely feasible. The heavily saturated colors of the board and units do make it somewhat difficult to step back and get an overview of the board position, but I enjoy the game as a light and fast romp, rather than a slow and tactical game, so this isn't much of a problem with the right opponents. Lastly, I'll say that the decision of when to send your civilizations into decline is wonderfully tense. I'm often so hesitant to pull the trigger on a decline or over eager to do so, and often regret my decision after the fact, but that just gives me more impetus to continue revisiting the game and tailoring my approach.

The game is easy to learn, fun to play and has some good strategy. Everyone who I've introduced this game to has wanted to pick it up for themselves after playing it. The replay ability is fairly high, but Small World does get slightly repetitive after a bit from me. 

After a few months of owning the game, I have to say that it does not hit the table too often. For me, this is because its simplicity in strategy falls short of other games that are more intellectually stimulating. It's still fun to play when I do and I'm never against playing the game.

I'm having a hard time deciding how much I like this game.  I enjoy playing it, but there is something about it that seems... I don't know, repetitive?  Formulaic?  Not super exciting?  It just doesn't grab me the way other games do.

For what it is worth, everyone I've played it with really seems to enjoy it.  The land-grab mechanic is easy to understand, but there are a ton of choices based on the variation of races and abilites.

It wore out it's welcome fairly quickly.

I don't love Small World.  It's not that it's a [i]bad[/i] game; it's okay.  I do like seeing the race combinations and evaluating which combination works best... but the rest of the game bores me.  

You'd think there would be interesting decisions in this game, but invariably it seems that most of the decisions are fairly obvious, or when they're not obvious they're equivalent.  Usually there is a race that is better than the rest, a starting point that you should use, regions that make sense to attack, etc.  Even choosing when to go into decline tends to be obvious.  

There just isn't a lot going on here.  It's just attack, attack, attack, decline, repeat.  There's not a lot of room for doing anything new or different.  Every game I've played feels like every other game with a spritz of a different race for flavoring.  I'll still play it occasionally, especially as my son likes it, but it's not something I'd seek out.

If the game was to be played with open VPs, I would give it a .5 bump in the rating.

As is, the game can derail if someone is not paying the proper attention.

The game do allow for some neat combos and uses for races and powers, but I just hate that players attack on the "supposed leader", when this person is likely in third place and just had a very good last turn, or someone that started well is trounced from round 4 to the last and finish in last.

But, with the right people, I'm down to play it.

Solid, fun stuff. It didn't feel like I expected it would - and I mean that in a good way. The different powers encourage different strategic approaches, and there are plenty of interesting tactical options.

The choice of when to decline is also an interesting one.

The production value of this game is incredible, it looks beautiful.  The game itself is area control with deterministic combat.  I think the problem I have with it is that it never feels like you're conquering anything, you're just temporarily taking land that someone else will eventually take from you.  I don't like having to give up on a race either, although it is nice to be able to play more than one race per game.  The different powers of each of the fantasy races are the best part about this game, as choosing which race you're going to play next is probably the most fun and interesting decision in the game.  Overall, it is an interesting experience but I don't quite understand the mass appeal.

Played this game as part of a six game tournament. Small World is designed to be different every time which helps the replay factor quite a bit. What amounts to an area control game is greatly helped with special abilities and interesting races. With different maps depending on the amount of players, the regions feel balanced and fun. My biggest complaint is the amount of reading for newcomers. It was impossible to get a grasp on my choices while keeping track of what my other players had without bringing the game to a grinding halt. I'd think that'd clear up after some extra plays, but talking some players into such a text heavy game might be difficult.

So I just got Small World along with Leaders of Small World and Cursed! in a recent math trade.  I was not overly thrilled about Small World but it seemed fun enough to at least try it out, especially when it was being traded for something I was not playing, and popular enough that if I didn't like it I could at least trade it.  Well, I'm not going to be trading it.  I played 2 games with the wife it was a blast.  The artwork is great.  The possible combinations of races are endless.  It's light and has on overall comedic tone which is fun and refreshing.  The game time is limited by the number of turns so it doesn't go on forever and can play a rematch or two in a single night.  I see an almost unlimited relpayability to this game and look forward to many more games to come.  
I want to try out the Tales & Legends expansion as that seems like it could add a lot of interesting variety and hilarity to the game.

Marauding Skeletons - Totally Bad Ass.  They ate up everything in their sight and kept coming back for more while continuing to grow in numbers!
Bivouacking Trolls - Impossible to fight, I just had to wait for them to conquer territories and go into decline.

This has killed Risk completely for me. Love the random races/powers and how games will always play different. After you get used the the game there are certain combos that you should always go after, but suprises still happen especially when you have more than 2 players.

RATING: 8
This game is enjoyable and different.  While some aspects are kinda just OK, it is really just a conquer as quickly as you can and timing of putting your race into 'decline.'  It is pretty fun though with the different combinations of races and special abilities.  The choice of when to decline along with how you concquer and use your abilities determines the game winner.  What is quite nice is that most games are pretty close as the balance is good in the game.

Really like this game.  I like Vinci, but this has several things going for it over Vinci:  scalable maps for number of players, THEME, easier rules, shorter playtime and THEME!!!!

RATING: 7
Yes, it's like Vinci, but very different also.  Nice bits, easier to account, and the fantasy theme makes it fun for all.  I like the different sized boards for different numbers of players, and I like the fact that there is a bits/rules trade-off (more bits make the rules easier to follow.) And, the bits are really cool, I like the box that just fits everything nicely (one of my favorite things about a game - like Jamaica, super-nice box!!) Other players of this game seem to vehemently dislike the box, doesn't fit expansions, etc. They want to take out the insert and use baggies (arrgghhhh).

A beautiful game that i have enjoyed many many times and still would enjoy today. It has an amazing replayability and is a very good game to play with people who is new to games. Easy to learn and play and also very thematic. Despite the replayability it sadly has declined for me in the last year or two. But i still have it very dear and recommend it for everyone.

RATING: 7
First impressions: Out of the box--wow, this is great, Diplomatic Ghouls and Swamp Wizards, stripped-down gameplay, ni-i-ice. But soon, some aesthetic things are jarringly unpleasing. The artwork is good but mismatched; it's like music where some of the chords are not right. You really must introduce some marker tokens harvested from another game. The money is (annoyingly) one-sided. The mountain tiles are ugly, big, and useless. However, the gameplay remains clean, quick and pretty fun. Maybe a little too light for any real staying power. Quick setup, slow takedown.

RATING: 6
In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.
Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.
Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!

I like the fixed game length and different maps for different numbers of players, and don't mind the minor rules changes. HOWEVER. The graphics are terrible. The Vinci board is ugly but functional. The Small World boards are much uglier and also much less functional - there are spaces that appear to be multiple spaces, spaces that are hard to tell the type of, and the general appearance is extremely busy and makes it hard to read the board. The different counters for the races look nice in isolation but work very poorly with the boards, and are not a great idea from a functionality perspective - Vinci's disks in PLAYER colors work much better. Without these issues I might rate this as high as 8, and buy it, but as it is I'm rating it 6 and not buying it. (There are also an annoying number of ambiguities in the rules for the powers, but at least those can be fixed.)

I lOVE THIS GAME! 
Generally I go for more cooperative games because of the people I play with, but sometimes you just want to smash other races into oblivion.
The great thing about this game is you can do it repeatedly and then get a new race. I'm always sad when its over which to me is the sign of a fabulous game.
Trying out the expansions now, they add new rces and abilities, so far still loving it!

I was looking forward to playing this game ever since its release, and I am happy to say that it does not disappoint. The quality of its components is staggering, from the gorgeous artwork right down to the thickness of each counter. The counter tray seems to pack everything too tightly, but otherwise every component fits the box splendidly. Best thing about its execution though is that the game comes with two double printed board of different sizes: Each for a specific number of players. As a consequence, it plays very well even with two players. Gameplay wise, the large number of race/power combinations ensures replayability and the game's length is perfect for playing two games in a row. Never played Vinci, but I would love to play this game again.
UPDATE: Played it a bit more, and it is starting to lose its appeal. Somehow, my last game felt a bit cold and clinical. Also, the game is much better with four players than it is with two (despite the special two player board).
UPDATE2: Regained interest in playing this game with two, thanks to the excellent Tales & Legends expansion. Using this, as well as the Grand Dames and Cursed expansions, the game felt much more exciting to me. Also, the game is much better with three than it is with two.

Played this game twice with two players, once with each player controlling two factions.

I am mixed on this game. I love the concept of the game but not really the execution. First, I like the idea of a declining race and the constant switching between forces. I feel like the pace of the game play is fast and furious and a little light hearted (I mean who wouldn't like merchant trolls and diplomatic orcs?) I also enjoy the very colorful bits and great production values for the game.

However, I do not like the fiddliness of the game. There are lots of bits and they can be extremely confusing when it comes to getting victory points. I think this is most likely a common problem for other players as well.

With two players, this game DOES NOT shine. I feel like certain races are way too powerful and if you get them early, you can quickly gain a foot hold that is insurmountable. I have a feeling this game shines with 4-5 players.

That said, for some reason, I don't like the theme nearly as much. I bet I would love a more serious theme. I remember playing history of the world and I absolutely loved it.

I will give this game a little bit more time to develop and see if it has staying power.

052613: Does not do much for me. After a few more repeated plays, this game will be on the for sale or trade list shortly.

Compared to other area control games, Small World just didn't click for me. For the most part, your decisions are quite obvious, with the most difficult one being choosing a starting location and what combination of races to choose. An inability to retaliate on an opponent's turn also was disappointing, making it frustrating when things don't go your way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a well designed game.  The base rules are consistent (ex. can't lose army on offense, defenders doesn't have to roll anything, how a starting army attacks, etc.) and intuitive (ex. each map area is distinct, how an army moves, etc.) requiring nothing more than basic math to resolve the size of attacking army required.  The specific rules for each of the badges/races overlay quite nicely over the base rules.

Two aspects that deserve HUGE praise is that there are different game boards for each of 2, 3, 4 and 5 players (with each being appropriately balanced with an even # of different regions).  I've never seen this done before ... obviously the designers REALLY care about game balance.  In addition the army tokens tray can be removed from the box itself (which is really handy).

The only thing preventing me from giving this game an even higher rating is my low amount of plays with only the 2 player option.

Well, wouldn't you know, but the "Column A/Column B" power generation system, variable map, and (by far most importantly) the fixed number of turns combine to produce a game that fixes all of Vinci's problems, and allow the system to shine.

Simple but rewarding fantasy -themed area control wargame. Good replay value through numerous combinations of race and trait tokens (not in perfect balance but doesn't matter that much). Plays in an hour and has a reversible board (other side with less areas) to enhance playability with small number of players (never tried with less than four though). Nice filler for super-heavies and several rounds makes it able to entertain a whole evening as well. Quite easy to approach for a wargame, much recommended for those seeking light strategy with fantasy theme.

I would rather listen to the Disney song for an hour straight than play this miserable excuse for a game again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After playing a game that took almost 2.5 hours, I probably won't play this ever again. Even when it only lasts 45 minutes, I still don't find Small World very enjoyable. Since the board is constantly changing, there is almost nothing to think about between turns, making downtime dreadful. The decisions are usually very easy to make. The main decision a player makes is when to go into decline, but this only happens 2-3 times per game. Additionally, many races are overpowered, giving some players a distinct advantage. I realize that there is more strategy than there seems, but I just don't find this fun. I would rather play most games over this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game, but I feel like it doesn't work well at all for five players or possibly even four.  The downtime between turns is immense with that many players, which is a big problem.  Smallworld works best for me with two or (at most) three players.

That being said, it is really enjoyable.  It requires you to be incredibly flexible in your thinking and pretty solid at risk analysis.  There's very little hidden information in this game, which is a good thing, but the random combinations of powers and races adds a ton of variety.

I think my wife and I might start a one-on-one series for this game.  

Another point: the box insert for this game is a bit frustrating.  I might just pull the insert and put everything into baggies.

Previous Comments - Once we started playing all the rules as they were designed, this game has a lot of depth. Never played Vinci (would like to), but I can't imagine where anyone can get off saying this game doesn't do that design justice.So what if it's a little more accessible. Still a good game that's going to be expanded a lot seeing as how it's hotness.

Obviously, there is skill in choosing the right race at the right time here. Also, positioning plays a role, analyzing likely future entry points or contested locations, protecting your inactive race etc. Still, so much comes down to who is being attacked. If your active race takes a big hit, you're never likely to win, and there are always the kingmaking issues that drags the game down in my view.

Really good battling game.  Love the theme and the variable powers each race is given.  Also like the drafting of the races.  It's a light-ish "war"-game with lots of head-to-head conflict, but you can so quickly gain the advantage by choosing a new race that I think it minimizes the direct feel of the conflict.  I enjoyed this quite a bit.  Need to better understand the advantages of all the races and modifiers...but this is a keeper!

Pros: area control game, fun theme, highly strategic with moderate level of tactical play, high variability

Cons: strategic imbalances, player interaction limited to conflict, can overstay its welcome; prone to kingmaking

I have no knowledge of its predecessor Vinci, so to me, this is simply a decent gateway area-control game with a fantasty theme. The elements of the rise and fall of civilizations in this microcosm is especially fun. Some balance issues with race powers knock it down a couple points for me, however. On top of that, the game discourages any sort of cooperation or alliances, so in my experience it is very difficult to convince others that a player with Pillaging Skeletons or something similar is a threat that necessitates working together against. Plus, the wife hates it.

This is one of our favorite games for casual gaming nights.  It has a fun theme and is very easy to learn and play.  You never really know who is winning until the end, especially when it can be so back and forth from round to round.

Sometimes this game is based too much on luck (getting the right combo) and someone aims to knock off the person they think is leading will change the complexity of the game.  It is fun and the changing combos of races and abilities is very nice, you have to play with the right group to really get enjoyment out of a game that feels like it takes forever or is over very fast.

Overall the game was just too little for us.  A shame since I love it's production values and the support Days of Wonder is giving it.  Traded.

Very cool game.....played a handful of times with my nine year-old. Area control.......great components.....just splendid and fun.  usually i like serious real graphics, but this works for me.  I would like to see more strategy involved though......so much relies on the choice of race.  how can we put a variant together to up the tactics and strategy?

Not enough interesting decisions for the play time. The decline/obsoletion mechanic could be great if used in a game where it happened more often and didn't take as long.

It's Kingmaker with 3+ and there's much better options for 2.

Beautiful components, sound design, different options available every new session, interesting decisions at every turn. Then why don't I have fun playing it? I find the hidden score means I can be beat 2-1 by someone I didn't even realize was doing well. While this is supposed to reduce the beat-down-the-leader aspect of games like Risk, it just means you let the leader run away with the game. I'll give it one or two more plays before I decide never to suggest it again.

I liked the idea of this game, I just don't like how long it is.  I had fun playing at when we started the game, but as the game went on, I just started having less and less fun.  By the end of the game, everyone playing was just beyond ready for the game to be finished, nobody was having fun.

I feel like Catan is to Monopoly as Small World is to Risk. Just a better designed, more streamlined, funner version.

I love the race/power combos and how they interact with the board. It's really dynamic and I can't see any game playing out the same way twice. I love how you constantly have to think in both the long and short term: what to do with your active race, when to put them into decline, and what new race to choose. Random chance plays a role, but there's tons of strategy if you look for it. Even trying to figure out another player's agenda and not get in their way. Great fun!

The obvious downside here is the setup and cleanup, but I hesitate to harp on that too much as it's the best it can be, and it's not too bad given the game length.

RATING: 5
A dice-less Risk clone, w/great art. Ultra bad storage in early edition. Setup and breakdown are both a pain in the ass.. Fun, if you forget about the boatloads of luck involved, and the inherent balance issues. Fun mechanics, at least. Can also, run a bit long, (like Risk again) for what it is. Traded for [gameid=68448] (one of my favorites). *Thanks, Megan! *Downside being, we have to play it, whenever she brings i over. It's a Small World, after-all. Minus the Hobbits apparently.

I credit this game with sparking my interest into the board gaming again. After a long hiatus where I mainly only played party games (Apples to Apples...), this game really brought me in as a great combination of attacking style of Risk, the no elimination/VP style that is typical in eurogames, tough decision making, and just enough player interaction to keep things interesting. 

I also love how there are expansions that help keep the maps fresh (or to even do scenarios), and other odds and ends like new races and a deck of cards.

Overall one of my all time favorite games.

Oct 2017:  Rating -1

Good game, but not a favorite for us.  Definitely better with 3-4 players than it is with 2.  With 2 players it's better if we run through the turn limit twice, giving us more time to battle for control of the board.  Maybe a slightly heavier end gateway game, though it only works if players are able to understand and make use of their special abilities.  (Not every race should be played with the same tactics, meaning your own tactics will have to change as you progress through the game.)

Some race/powers are very OP, especially when combined.  Merchant Titans or Merchant Ratmen, for example, can give you a huge lead pretty quickly that is difficult for anyone else to catch up with.

I really want to like this game.  It seems like there's just too much accounting in it. It's hard to keep the game going quickly when you have to go back and recount all of your territories again and again.  We always make mistakes or have to refer back to the rules.  Hopefully I can come back and rerate this after more plays but I don't see it.

RATING: N/A
Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race to occupy adjacent territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go "into decline". At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy.

Has the Catan problem where you only have a few truly interesting decisions (Catan: starting placements, Small World: picking a race), and everything else is by-the-numbers.

I wanted to try [gameid=60] for the longest time, and when this reinvention came out, I thought I was set. The production is up to  [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/1027]Days of Wonder's[/url] usual high standards, and there's high replayability here, with different race/trait combinations to keep things fresh.

The gameplay, though is disappointingly vapid. Rather than a truly dynamic experience, it devolves into a dull exercise in pulling down the (perceived) leader. It's also too short. Adding on turns won't solve this problem, as the game doesn't have enough meat to make a longer gameplay experience interesting.  Add in a luck factor and a problematic player-to-my-right importance with race availability, and the game is both unsatisfying and frustrating.

I've since played Vinci, and I realize now that this is a problem with the system, more than a problem with the game.  If you're looking for light dudes-on-a-map, go for [gameid=1159], [gameid=94246], or [gameid=15363] instead.

A little disappointed by SmallWorld, maybe I was expecting too much of it.
The main mechanism of the game is really convincing others you are not currently winning. Which could be fun, but does not make it for me. The conquest part of it looked quite easy, without much tactical considerations. 

I could change my mind after playing it with open VP, though I must confess not been really keen on playing the game again :-( Too much games for the time available I guess.

EDIT: after more plays, up'ed my rating from 6.5 to 7.5. Still not think it is a terrific game, but it is a bloody good one. The "diplomatic" part of the game still bores me, but I now see how much skill there is in the game. Plus my daughters (7 years) love it, so it has to be taken into account !!

Updated after the fourth, much more recent, play. I kinda liked the game, but of course the setup and explaining the stuff to the new players might take some time.

Fifth play with 4, quite nice game, everyone had played before at some point. Setup takes some time, but not that much really, when you know what you are doing.

Nice components, fun, and good two-player. Feels somehow trivial. The main decision is when to send your race into decline and choose a new race. Between periods of decline, the tactical decisions each turn feel obvious. For this reason, it's ok but slightly boring.

I've never been a huge fan of area control games, or even area majority games (whichever this one happens to be), but the two things going for this are the simplicity of the rules, and the short play time of the game.

With me being a fantasy fan the theme is dead on and a must have for my collection.

Great game!  For me, it has a high fun factor, the rules are simple(ish), and there is lots of player interaction.  The game really allows you to crack jokes about other players moves, and try to convince them not to attack you.  Though, I may like the art style of Small Worlds Underground better.

Edit: After playing this game many, many times, I have found the rules are not in fact simple for new players.  That the power / race combination is too tricky for people new to board gaming, or to just the game itself.  I personally gave the game to a friend because I was tired of explaining the rules to the game.

Probably our family's favorite game. It's great for kids (ours are ages 11, 12, and 15). It's very unique and creative and the artwork is a lot of fun. The quick pace and need to "go in decline" and choose new monsters to control keeps it interesting and adds a lot of replayability.

Spelat ett par ggr nu och även om det är oerhört mycket smågrejer att hålla ordning på så lär man sig snabbt. Erövra provinser med hjälp av olika raser och specialkrafter i en fantasymiljö. Har enbart testat med fyra spelare - kan ej uttala mig hur det är att spela med färre... Kul spel - som kan svänga under en spelomgång (vilket alltid är bra!)

RATING: 7
Satisfyingly well-designed game with deterministic combat- no unlucky dice rolls here!

A large part of winning is about identifying which of the available race/power combinations you want to play as, and how to best play them to exploit the edge you get. As such, inexperienced new players will usually get annihilated (although wealthy halflings won me my first ever game!).

It does have an "elect the leader" problem, where if everybody gangs up on one player, there is no comeback for them. But the crowds I've played with are normally pretty good at bashing the actual leader rather than just the player everybody assumes will win.

I have enjoyed every game I've played, winning or losing, and it's short enough that if you're losing you don't need to sit in misery for long and there are still interesting decisions to make in the meantime.

I've also seen a few impressive turnarounds where outgunned players have switched to a particularly good new tribe and come from behind to win.

In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.
\13\\13\
Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.
\13\\13\
Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!

RATING: 6
I was looking forward to buying Small World after Days of Wonder started running their very successful teaser ad campaign for it. Fortunately, I managed to play someone else's copy before I did. It's not a terrible game, it's just far too simple. The random pairing of different racial bonuses and civilization traits for each session is a very cool mechanism, but the rest of the game lacks meaningful decisions. The lame invasion rules feel less like a fantasy war game and more like a Mancala variant.

I want to love it, but I just can't shake the feeling that it could have been so much more. Playing it is like going down to the local tavern and sitting in front of the Guinness tap and ordering a Bud Light.

NOTE: The digital version (Smallworld 2) improves things quite a bit. The game hasn't changed at all, but with the computer tracking scores, managing chits and making set-up and take down instantaneous my appreciation for it has grown. As a quick 15-20 minute game, the simplicity of the rules make a lot more sense. Sell your hard copies and get the app, you'll have much more fun.

I usually tell my friends its "Risk without the dicerolling". Randomness only comes from which race/ability combo (which also provides a ton of replayability). Territorial control in a decently themed and well produced package. More "fun" than "technically good", but not technically bad.

My description of Small World is always 'Risk but actually good'. Everything about Small World is fine and works well, but ultimately it's just not my thing.

I will add this, though - as charming as the racial and special abilities and their pairings are, if you see past all of that down to the pure math of what you can achieve in what time, you'll obliterate the competition still too caught up in role-playing their flying bears or whatever. Honestly, I don't often turn into a cold machine but it just isn't fair what I do to people in this game. I don't know that I should take the full blame for it, though - perhaps there isn't enough in the game to 1. obscure the math and/or 2. protect/defend against it. I dunno. The optimal action including going into decline and purchasing races at what price with what cash bonus seem to all be way too easy to extrapolate at each point of the game.

Cosmic Encounter's poor cousin. Admittedly Small World is much easier to explain to casual players, but this comes at the price of being a boring game which lacks variety. There aren't many races to choose from and many of them are very similar: one of them gets bonus points for controlling woods while the other gets bonus points for controlling fields. Woohoo. Play Cosmic Encounter instead.

i dont know the game this is a reworking of (vinci i think its called) but i know i enjoy this a lot!

in simplest terms its a very simple conquest game but on a board that is designed to be just a little bit too small  for the peple invading,

at the end of a players turn they score points on what their factions control (i say factions as  at most a player can have 3  2 of which can be active assuming teh right abilities or races are chosen)

the fun of teh game for me is finding that point when you give up on a race and start a new one, in some of teh games played i have stuck to only 2 races but in others 4 or 5 once (though that 5 was a bad idea)

very fun game with good quality bits i dont feel i need the expansions but are certainly on my list of things to buy

I love me my light, fast, conflict-heavy games (see Neuroshima Hex, Nexus Ops, Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, Heroscape, etc.).

I guess it works fine as a gateway area control game. It has simple mechanics and it looks gorgeous. But more experienced players will find this game very repetitive and boring rather fast. There's just not enough variety in the things to do in the game and additional races from expansions don't seem to fix it. After one play I thought "this isn't too bad". But a few games later I thought to myself "wait, is that really all there is to this game?".

Great fun! Good game system with the thinning out of your race over the territory and then put your race in decline (as if endangered species), to start conquering again with a new race! Funny ability-race combinations (berserker sorcerers and diplomatic dwarfs!). The simplistic battle system makes this game fast-paced .. When I get a copy of this game I might take out the dwarfs though, as I've heard they're really crap in this game.

Played a 5-player game and found it to not be my cup of tea.  The fantasy theme with orcs, trolls, skeletons, ghouls, etc. are matched randomly with special powers.  Would have been great in the 5th grade, but I couldn't wait for the game to be over.  Even if it was re-themed to some military, I don't think I would care for it.  It is sort of a light wargame and may play better with 2 or 3 rather than 5.  It was a crap-shoot to see who would win.  Not planning on playing again.

Had to play again, with the expansions this time.  Still do not like.

RATING: 8
This looks like the version of Vinci that I want to have!  And yes,  it definitely is the version of Vinci I want to have.

Wish there were a couple more races (so that the stack doesn't ever run out - it ran out once in a 4er,  so could theoretically be pretty much empty in a 5er)  But the die definitely helps reduce the calculation - now that anyone can have up to +3 attack,  you can't ever be sure that you're safe (which is good!)  Still grinds a bit at the end,  but the power combos are just plain fun to play with!

Small World reminds me somewhat of Risk but redesigned in such a way that it plays in half the time, with less slavish dependance upon sheer luck with dice rolls, while seamlessly introducing unique player powers to create deeper interest. In short, I think Small World is a delightful game that has enough variety and strategy for gamers while being approachable and fun for non-gamers. It scales well from 2-5 players and the art and graphic design are wonderfully charming.

I think Small World is everything Risk wishes it could be but never knew was possible before now.

Very good game. Area control with completely different races and special abilities. Races and abilities are mixed up every game so each pair will likely be something new. There's no way to get reinforcements and games are limited to a small number of turns, so  a concept of sending your race into 'decline' so you can grab another one comes into play.

Good game.  The "secret scoring" system is nice in that it reduces some of the analysis paralysis that plagues the last couple of turns of Vinci, but a sufficiently motivated person could certainly keep track of this during the course of the game.  In that case an undesirable (to me) memory component of the game emerges and the AP returns.

First game I every bought after watching it played on an episode of tabletop. A really solid area control game with beautiful fantasy artwork and good replayability through race/power combinations and the declining race mechanic allowing you to play multiple race/power combinations over one game. Simple to pickup but has some tactical layers for more savvy gamers.

I can't win at this game.  That's probably why I rate it so low.  The pieces are pretty, and the premise is fun.  I just really, really suck at this game.

Update:  The pieces are pretty, but the premise is no longer fun.  A boring slog through counting counters and looking at the powers/races description. Blegh.  This would be off my shelf if The Wife didn't have a strange affinity for it.

I've played Small World (and Underground) three times now, and every time I've had a bad experience. My first game was probably the worst, as I went into decline one turn too late and before we even got halfway through the game, I just knew I was going to sit there for another hour or so picking my nose and waiting for it to be over. The rest is history. Gave it an honest chance, still hate it.

RATING: 8
An area control game with cartoonish fantasy art that plays well with 2-5.  Downtime between turns can sometimes be a bit of a drag, but if players are quick this is a fun game. Not a lot of strategy but has some tactical elements, mainly in deciding the race/power combos you select, and when to make a race go into Decline so they become inactive.

A fun little game where you watch your mini empires rise and fall.  Knowing when to fold ("decline") your active empire is tough.  Thoroughly enjoyable, and beautiful components.  Not quite a wargame, although a game full of conflict.

RATING: 6.795
Simply yet innovative war game; the game creates a number of races for you (one racial trait mixed randomly with one other trait) and you set about conquering the map.  At some point, you'll set your current race into 'decline' and start again with a new race.  If you like Risk but wanted to branch out into something new then this is a good choice.

This was given as a complete surprise gift. I didn't know what to expect upon reading "slaughter" on the box (wasn't looking forward to it), and I didn't get the "It's a Small World Afterall" reference for a while. Upon looking it over, I thought it might be like Risk, which I'm not a fan of. But after playing it a few times, I get that it's totally different. I like the concept of sunsetting civilizations, starting new ones, and taking over areas based entirely on population vs. dice roll. A favorite of my teen to play with his friends (but not with dad).

Small World neemt het simpele systeem van Risk en maakt het nog simpeler wat betreft combat, maar zorgt er wel voor dat er allerlei verschillende soorten en rassen voorkomen met allerlei verschillende eigenschappen die er toch voor zorgen dat de gevechten erg gevarieerd zullen zijn. 

De spelers verdienen punten door zoveel mogelijk gebied in te nemen in small world. Maar zodra je op je hoogtepunt bent kun je ook net zo snel weer in verval raken en dan neemt een ander ras het weer van je over.

Wife's 2nd most favorite game. In fact we have a huge Plano chest to put all the pieces/boards/ and expansions) in. So many options for an easy area control game. May feel the same after a while but we have not had that feeling due to all the combos and expansins. Game needs at least three people to play well due to some unfair combos (diplomatic elves for example) but coming back on the board with a new and better race for revenge is a good feeling.

Small World is a good introductory board game.  There is not much depth here, but the theme is fantastic.  Multiple plays will leave you with a strong feeling of repetition and a desire to try something else.  Several of the power/race combinations are over-powered while others are extremely weak.  This can cause frustration when even the best strategy is overcome by luck of the draw.

RATING: 7
Shorter and better than Risk.  Too bad the great American populace will never embrace Small World as the standard light wargame that sits on everyone's shelves.  Just a few too many special rules, I think - otherwise it could happen.

Other setbacks:

If you take the game seriously (which you shouldn't), turn order in the final round is problematic.  You've all heard the gripes, but just to restate: during the final round, players who go later in turn order are unable to impact the score of players who went earlier in turn order.  Once you score for the last time, after all, you're out of the game for good.

Then there are the inadequate/nonfunctional cheat sheets.  The point of a cheat sheet is not to have players constantly look in the real rules to track down the omitted (yet critical) exceptions or details that pertain to your chosen race or special power.

And don't get me started on the marathon-length FAQ.  The official rules clarifications (I lost count once they outnumbered my brain cells) should - of course - be integrated into an updated ruleset.  If this never happens, I call lame on Days of Wonder.

But even after all that, I like this game and would heartily recommend it to others.

This game is what RISK would be if it was a Euro.

Great area control game that suits a nice range of players.  The core rules are relatively simple and straightforward (place 2 tokens plus one more for each extra thing on the space) so it's easy to teach, and it plays relatively quickly.   Almost all of the complexity comes in with the ability combinations, but for the most part those can be left unexplained until they actually come up.

The very minimal amount of luck involved in the game can occasionally lead to some AP issues, but it's generally not an issue.   With certain groups there can also be some tendency to "beat up on the leader", but having the victory points hidden helps reduce that somewhat.

Small world is a good game. Very nice components, easy rules (although you can argue that there is an exception to every rule due to race and special powers). It is also quite exciting. But at the end of the game I do not fell like skillful play was crucial (important but ...) to winning and hence I do not experience an urge to play it again right away. It is a nice, light game though so I rate it a 7.

Not as long and complicated as it first seems.  Interesting choices to be made.

The mixture of races and special powers are interesting and provide nice variability.

I love the randomness, but this game does something that is always aggravating, it creates a possible hopeless situation for a player.

If you play a bad round, and only collect 6 or 7 gold, when another player collects 15 or more, the game is effectively over. If you can only collect 6 or 7 gold, then your race needs to go into decline, which means that next turn you're collecting that same 6 or 7, while the other player collects way more, effectively making almost certain that the rest of the game would be nearly pointless.

In a game of 4 or more, this can mean that you're waiting for 10-20 minutes each round before playing your 2 or 3-minute turn. And when you go into decline, that's effectively a pass, meaning you could be waiting 20-40 minutes before doing anything, which isn't a worry if you're not in a hopeless situation.

When this doesn't happen, and everyone has their strategy contend with others evenly, this is a fun game. But too often have I seen someone trudge through the 2-hour session in a 6-person game after hitting a moment like this in round 3.

Game with simple base rules, but the racial combinations do require players peeking at the rules a couple of times to remember what power X or race Y did exactly. With experience you are probably better at understanding which combinations are good for the given situation.

I definitely like the phasing out of your current civilization and exchanging it for a new one. Becoming good at this game involves understanding the nuances and best timing to perform the switch.

Enjoyed this much more than the first game I played, where the most experienced player just ruined everyone else. It was also a 5-player game and went kind of long.

3-player was much better and went pretty quickly. It's still an incredibly fiddly game with all the pieces and necessary reference sheets so I'll never personally own it, but I would definitely play again. Completely changed my mind on this one.

Art and theme is awesome.  Easy game to learn and plays fairly quickly.  The race/trait combos expands the replay value for a long time.

Only downside is the box insert.  No clear way to pack everything nice and neat back into the box.  The armies tray does not hold everything evenly and the instruction book diagram for the insert in the back is garbage.

I've only played this once, but it made a fantastic 1st impression.  I like everything about the game, the 2 power combinations.  The whole ebb and flow of gameplay.  The way you strive as hard as you can to use your resources to get a huge and efficient empire type thing.  Then you abandon it and start over. (getting points from it while it lasts unprotected)  I cannot see this game not being a fun experience ever.

It's not that I don't like area control games, I just don't like how Small World does it.  If you have more tiles than the other guy, you win the "battle" for the region.  Sure there are racial bonuses and the occasional special ability, but overall, it's just not that interesting. The race tiles are small, and admittedly, the art is fun. However, I wish it were easier to differentiate between a player's tiles. You really have to look at the art on the tiles, and from across the table, that can be easier said than done.

How can you improve on Vinci? How about extracting the basic framework and then taking a page out of Strange Synergy by implementing randomly modular races and powers - neither of which are particularly balanced - and then compound matters even further by randomizing the order in which players obtain said combinations, ensuring that the first to choose receive the strongest pairs while later folks are simply in an inferior position, and might have to pay victory points or suffer an even worse fate? (In my first game I went first and took Seafaring Amazons at no cost, which progressed at 7,10,11 points per turn before the decline. Second player took Fortified Humans at no cost and scored just as many points if not a tad more. The other three players were not only forced to settle for inferior pairings - Bivouaking Sorcerers, Flying Elves, Berserking Orcs - but also had to pay an extra VP so as to skip the self-contradictory Hill Dwarves!) The worst part is that these "decisions" about race/power selection and their eventual rewards are incredibly easy to eyeball, so the game feels more like dull, limited optimization than a playground of options and possibilities. Of course, races and powers are hardly balanced; Giants and Tritons are strictly worse than Amazons unless you're planning on knocking over five coastal or down-the-mountain regions in one turn, Trolls WTF BROKEN WILL NEVER BE ATTACKED AFTER DECLINE. Powers are similarly busted - Fortified, Wealthy, Stout, Dragon Master are all exceptional, the others are at best situational and variants on the same "+1" mechanic. Naturally some races and powers can be incredible, but only at certain times or with certain combinations, further expanding the divide between how turn order and chaos ultimately decide the victor, with a little shaft-the-winner thrown in for good measure, because - y'know - that's preferable to actually starting players on an equal footing.

this actually works rather well for a wargame-lite History of the World clone.  i like the various powers, although a couple of them seems a little too powerful, like Berserker and Commando.  It's pretty quick, and has good replayability.  It is however lacking a certain quality that i demand from the really stellar games.  there isn't enough of a good thing, meaning, it needs something like cards to really kick it over.  Too simple is maybe the way to describe it.  i have high hopes for the future expansions.

A very easy, quick, and fun 'wargames' to have that accessible to everyone. The replyability isn't endless, but It's definitely up there among others. There's just a lot of combination, that even when playing in the same map, I have never felt like I'm playing the same strategy over and over. The game also scale well so naturally it quickly become the most played game in my collection.

But it has its problem:

1) Sometimes your opponents get all the good combination and you're stuck with the bad ones with little room to affect things.

2) Setting up and cleaning up the game is a chore

3) Even with experienced players the game played a bit longer than it should for a light game.

I can't help but think of Small World as the poor man's version of Vinci.  I also can't stand claims of the hidden VP as an improvement when you can play it that way in the original if you choose to, not to mention it is completely trackable information so it's pretty easy to figure out who is in the lead anyway.  Even so, the variable boards according to the number of players as well as a set number of rounds are both good implementations.  However, I much rather play Vinci because I've found the powers to be a lot more interesting and balanced than the combinations in Small World.

Small World is game without much strategy. It's just attack, attack, attack - back and forth. Normally I don't care much for games like this. I really should hate it, but I can't - maybe it's because funny combination of race and power that come up once in a while.

New review:

Well, after pretty much ignoring this game for ... a couple of years even, I decided to brake it out the other day with my partner and have done a complete one-eighty on this game!
Maybe it was the fact that I RE-learned the rules (which, I might have been less clear on the first few times) or it might be the fact that I've learned the nuance of how to actually gain the victory points that determine the outcome of the game.  
Once you understand that your race is dispensable, and that by the time your opponents have finished their turns, you may not have a race worthy of keeping, you can actually form somewhat of a longer term strategy - valuing not only the synergy of special power and race, but also active and in-decline races.
Also, understanding when to be passive verses aggressive [and to WHOM you should be aggressive] makes a HUGE difference.  Sometimes attacking your opponent will actually net you LESS victory points than simply expanding into unoccupied territory, or even simply passing up any movement whatsoever.  I missed this strategy completely when we first played Small World, opting instead to almost always go for the throat - and then ending all our games baffled as to why the victory points didn't match what we thought were our successes in combat.  
Now that I've figured this game out I have no doubt it will be one that is long lived in our gaming group.  Like Cosmic Encounter, I'm itching to play with different combos of race and power, and to pick up any and all expansions that facilitate those myriad of combos. 

Old review (I gave it a 6):

I think i'm missing something whenever i'm playing this game.  Mechanically it seems to work.  But the it's just not... not as fun as it should be.  
The area control and race selection mechanics are good.  In fact, I love the race selection.  It lends itself to interesting combinations of powers, similar in a way to those of Cosmic Encounter.  And you get to play as more than one (you put your race into "decline" and purchase a new one to champion).  
I think a key flaw in the game is that when you do give up on a race, you must essentially skip your turn.  and in a game with limited turns, that means you'll do very little for at least one or two rounds of a game.  
Also, there is the fact that the rules are somewhat vague for certain races/abilities.  The quick reference sheet isn't bad, but with so many races and abilities, you'll be looking at that sheet and clarifying rule vaguenesses for longer than you will be actually moving troops on the board.  
 Again, I feel like i'm missing something that I can't quite put my finger on.  The alternate/expansion, Underground, adds some "item" and "location" mechanics that make the area control a bit more focused - with out it, your movement choices often come down to "am i strong enough to screw over my opponent here? or am i better of not being combative and just pick up points in another empty place?"  The board is small and SHOULD make interaction and "screw you over" happen more often.  But I feel like you never get ahead when you "screw over" people, so why bother?  Atleast the items/locations in Underground make an enemy location more tempting.
I'm not sure what could fix this game, but it just isn't that fun.

Another game prone to suicide bombing and kingmaking.  SmallWorld is too often decided by who you take down rather than by how well you play.  I like the racial powers but the choose-one-player-to-screw factor hurts the game considerably.

The landscapes are beautiful but the cartoonish creature illustrations are merely adequate.  They'd be improved by more serious or more abstract art.

RATING: 8
My opinion of Small World has raised significantly with repeat plays. It's fun, attractive, plenty of strategy and replayability with the variable race powers. It's a keeper.

Some balance issues, 2p can be decided very early on from the available race combos being OP. First turn Stout something declined into Flying Skeletons or Spirit Ratmen etc. All in all a very cutthroat and satisfying game which plays fast and looks cute! Recommended.

RATING: 7
As with [thing=60]Vinci[/thing], there is a lot of downtime, especially with new players, but otherwise a game of subtle strategy and puzzle-solving, really.  Warring is represented, but less as conflict, and more as a predictable occurrence.  You can conquer all day long and not win.  The key is in maximizing your "income" with both your live civilization and your declining one.  The feel is almost identical to [thing=60]Vinci[/thing]; however, having different boards for the different numbers of players can only be an improvement.

The mix-and-match of peoples and powers provides some nice variability and replay value.  It also makes it very easy to expand, as [company=1027][/company] and numerous BGG users have deftly demonstrated.

Decent game... the rules are rather simple and the mechanics of the game make it such that it's a different game for every play.

I want to try it a few more times but as it stands the wife hates it and I can sorta see why. Just one of those games that looks and sounds better than it actually is when you sit down to play it.

Két egymást követő kétfős játék után eddig tetszik, remélem többen is hasonlóan pörgős és jó hangulatú lesz.

3 és 4 fővel is oké, viszont így nem tudok belőle többet játszani egymás után, annyira azért nem pörög.

AMAZING game. Great way to choose players, and plenty of variety. Many characters can be verry good for backstabbing!

RATING: 9
I like it for the immediacy of action. Roll in, club things, recognize when your race is spent and grab another. It resembles risk, but when you feel cornered, just start up a fresh race. I think there are balance issues with amazons, dwarves and skeletons, but otherwise well done!

I enjoy this game a lot. It's easy enough to get your head around but it's immensely variable with it's maps and races and powers. A good gateway game.

A decent little game to play in 1-1.5 hrs depending on the number of players. There is a fair amount of kingmaking possible in larger games, but the different races and abilities really give it replayability value.

RATING: 7
Great components, outstanding theme. Race combinations are interesting, break the rules in fun ways. Very common to hear "ooh, that race is ridiculous..." However, feels a bit slow and prone to AP, especially with more players. The races are the most interesting part of the game, but you typically only pick 2-3 each game, so it's only relevant for some of the game. Fun, but I don't pull it out much.

This is a pretty fun game, very simple to learn but complex to master, it's all about getting the right combination for the right price when working out how best to use the army you chose.  So far around 12 of my friends have played this with me and none of them dislike it.

The game that got me in the hobby. 
Basic area control masterpiece. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Solid game.  The only reason I give it a 9 instead of the 10 is because the race tokens tend to blend into the board and it can sometimes be difficult to tell one race image from another.  There needs to be more image/color contrast.  But other than that tons of fun!

RATING: 6
Game works well enough mechanically, but quite chaotic and with no sense of narrative or theme, No desire to play again.

RATING: 8
Wonderful and fun area control game. The comment I'll make about all of its expansions is: whether you like a particular race or ability, just get them. More diversity makes the game better. The dynamic of determining whether to push your luck for one more turn or to go into decline adds a good strategic dimension. The theme is light, fun, and I think really makes the game. Yes, this is essentially a retheme of Vinci, but the more abstracted nature of Vinci turns me off in a way that Haflings and Ghouls doesn't.

Very simple but works really well.  The true fun in this is watching the march of time as each race swollows up the one before it. Seems to work well even with 2 players (although more is always better).

Люблю эту игру. Красивая, каждый раз разная, стратегичная, европейская с фентезийной темой. В основе - теория пассионарности (о пробуждении и закономерном затухании этноса). Жаль, что жене не нравится, поэтому редко играю.

Great short game for casual play(ers). It has colorful artwork , many races to play with so no game will be the same. The rulebook is a mess and alot of reading of faq boards is needed to correctly play the game.

Great area control war game. I've heard players complain that it is too simplistic and deterministic, but I love it. The fantasy theme really shines and it's a different experience every game due to the random combinations. The fact that it has hidden points and no player elimination though are it's strongest selling points for me.

Great components, artwork, and theme. It's easy to grasp what you should be doing in the game, if a little harder how to do it as efficiently as possible. The powers and races are great and pretty much make the game.

Own most of the expansions (except that Realms modular stuff).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The different combinations of all the powers are really neat (and the art is very nicely done). Plays briskly. Really nice that there are separate boards for 2, 3, or 4 players. Dependent on judicious leader-hosing, but at least usually ends up with quite close scores.

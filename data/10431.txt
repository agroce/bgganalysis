GAME: Epic Armageddon
RANK: 2814
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good tactical game with a lot of flavour and style.  It really feels epic as huge formations sweep across wide battlefields trying soften up the enemy holding a vital location before going in for the final desperate assault.  Reservations are around cost, availability of pieces, and time to set up compared to a board game, but this is the same of most miniatures games.  It's fine if you have the models and a place to play.

RATING: 5
GW's worst mistake was backing and pushing Lord of the Rings instead of this great game system, which goes largely ignored as is typical for GW company support. Whoever runs the marketing at Games Workshop should be fed to a Orc Warboss...seriously. For the poor marketing and support, I grade what could be a "7" down to a 5, cause if you buy this, expect to rely on fans not the company, to help you out. Until at least GW shuts down more of their websites.

RATING: 7
Epic 40K is still the best sci-fi battle game that GW has ever produced. LOTS and LOTS of units make that the dice-rolling mechanics of the game are still very tactical. Units move fast over an enormous field, and this makes for a very tactical game, contary to GW's other static, slow and cumbersome battle games.

The most recent addition to my Epic collection.  Picked this one up on my wife and I's last trip to England from a GW store.  The same store infact that years earlier Aaron and I checked out in London while eating a baked potato smothered in curry.  Delicious.  Anyway, the newest version of the game reads better than ever!  I doubt I will ever play it again, but I still have all my old mini's from the older additions, so there is an outside chance....  Good stuff!

For anyone downloading the rulebook from the GW site... they don't have a link to the pdf...
Let me give you a clue on how to get it... It's Section 0, and it's the Introduction. Take a look at the pdf filenames for the other sections, and you should be able to figure it out :)

RATING: 8
Solid implementation of a fairly straight-forward miniatures system. Perhaps not as much 'chrome' as some would have expected. Availability of the minis (or lack thereof) is probably a drag for many players. Not a game for shot-by-shot detail, but a good quick play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A brilliant set of rules - it is hard to believe that GW made it considering their last decade of mediocrity. 

Orks, Tyranids and Squats painted and table ready.
Eldar - vehicles and titans painted, infantry still to do. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Was rated 6. If GW doesn't want their products covered by this site, though, I'll oblige (to a degree).

A fun game of 6mm SF combat. The command system is nice, but using a d6 makes it a little too clunky for me. I also have trouble getting my minis painted, which ends up de facto cutting my rating by a point. Picked up Swordwind (the supplement with Eldar) when they reprinted it.

A relatively light version of a heavy miniatures game, this is let down by only having a single tournament scenario that heavily favors mobile lists. It is still one of my personal favourite games and achieves a great balance between the detail and the grand strategy of this level of combat.

Simply best Epic ruleset to date. Keeps the individuality of the units while maintaining the feel of large scale battles. I really would like to play this more often, unfortunately opponents are difficult to find. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The miniatures are for the most part absolutely great and I like the feel of the big, ehm huge, forces at my disposal. I've got bits and pieces of all the three basic armies in this book. Right now the only painted and hence played force is the Imperial Guard however. The rules are quite different from other GW games and flow nicely. They can be a bit tricky to get the hang of but are well worth the effort. The focus of the game is more on controlling objectives than killing off the enemy forces.

RATING: 8
Just like Warmaster is the fun version of Warhammer Fantasy, this is the fun version of 40K.  Stay away from the main two games if you want an actual Game.  If you can handle a slight lowering of mini quality (epic scale infantry look kinda dumb), play this instead.

You can play this game for free!  Screw minis.  Print and play whatever you want, and free rules.  Really quite good.  Nice abstractions for morale and bundling up close combat actions.  Could be a 9 if I get a regular partner.

Although this game has a certain streamlined charm to it, I really like the original Space Marine a lot better. SM was certainly more "fiddly", but in my eyes had considerably more personality. I wept the day they abandoned the Squats. (Well, not really)

RATING: 4
My rating is based entirely on the atrocity that is the rulebook.

An interesting game, which puts things like WH40K into proper scale. Mass battles are meant for tiny figures, and not the 30 mm fare of 40K and WFB.

That said, the printed rulebook is a frigging atrocity.
It's by far THE worst laid out and designed rule book I have EVER seen, and I even wear a Geek decoder ring, which allows me to translate even the most horrible and obscure rules around.

I think this rulebook busted my Geek Decoder ring, as I find it difficult to follow the most simple of situations in the horror show of rules...

I have 3000 points of Orks, and I have yet to play a game, as I can't seem to grasp the rules from the rulebook alone. I find this discouraging to say the least, let alone the complete lack of support from GW.

I'm still contemplating selling all of my stuff on eBay (update: Sold on eBay), but since I don't really need the cash, I'm still hanging onto it. If I can ever figure out how to play, I might just like it.

Oh, Games Workshop, why have you abandoned your best line of games? Bring back the Specialist Games line!

RATING: 9
Epic: Armaggon is the miniatures game for me at the moment. It allows playing army scale battles and rules are very good. Blast Marker mechanic especially works very nicely causing you to consider the placement of your troops to how much you want to save them and how much you want them to fire. There are some oddities in rules but mostly they work great. Definitely on the top of GW games. Main problem is that GW doesn't support this game.

Another GW orphan. I enjoy playing it, but the number of minis required made it expensive to play with forces of any size. The Tau on ForgeWorld look awesome but I could never afford them. This is a sourcebook that replaced the boxed game of Warhammer 40,000 Epic.

Huge disappointment. Was so excited to be on the playtesting team back when Jervis opened it up, but just didnt like the direction the game was going, nor the theme, nor the limited units which appear in the rulebook. This could have been a lot better and I think Jervis was trying to do too much with Fanatic/Specialist games at the time, and the drawn out release schedule meant some armies wouldnt be released for years. So even though unofficial army lists were released, many of the armies weren't re-produced. The new miniatures were hit and miss too.

Some people love the rules, but table-top games involve more than that, and thats a big chunk of where EpicA loses out.

If I had to recommend a version of Epic to a new player, it wouldnt be this one.

Fun: 5/5
Large scale battles featuring infantry, tanks, futuristic weapons and gigantic war-machines. Wargaming doesn't get more fun than this!

Challenge: 4/5
The alternating actions make for lot of tough decisions and give the game a chess-like quality. However, the game sometimes hinges on one or two key dice rolls, which can be frustrating.

Theme: 5/5
The different races have been brilliantly transferred to the tabletop, with each having a totally unique feel. The game oozes 40K flavour without being weighed down with excessive detail.

Overall: 5/5
One of my favourite games across all genres, it delivers what I want from a wargame. Exciting, dynamic battles unfolding in front of you, the feel of being in command and intelligent tactics and strategies rewarded.

Solid minis game with a great action mechanic.  Fun for the right crowd.

Fantasy Flight has been killing it in the Star Wars realm right now.  They've completely obsoleted a couple of GW games I used to play: Aeronautica Imperialis and Battlefleet Gothic (with X-Wing and Armada, respectively.)

I would love to see FFG take on this space.  A larger-scale miniatures combat game with infantry, speeders, and AT-ATs.  Please, guys, complete the set.  I'll buy it.

A good game. Sadly no longer supported, but still played by a large band of followers, battles with 6mm armies in the grim future!

This game sort of expands upon epic40k, as it reintroduces lots more detail, the game plays a bit slower, and the armies tend to be smaller. But having said that, its still a very good game.

Always an epic experience. Takes some preparation (setting up the terrain, creating armies), but this can be quick, and creating armies is fun. Good improvements on the previous incarnations, streamlined and tactically interesting.

Educationally provocative game with some noble goals.  Could benefit from a little more polish and maybe some balancing.  Also would like to see a stronger end-game thematic climax, whether it is a card that describes how the game is over... that maybe is different each time one plays, perhaps changing scoring a little bit. In other words, the end-game should make more sense thematically, not just something that happens because a deck ran out of cards.

Rating is for solo play. There is one clear winning strategy with no challenge at all, since it's so easy to thin your deck and go through the pathogens draw pile.

A bit more interesting is the meta game of houseruling to increase the challenge. But I am bored of that, too.

Too bad.

This cleverly themed deck building game provides a wide variety of play options in a colorful biological assault playground.  The concepts are a bit abstract with a ton of text intending to educate and explain how the mechanisms mirror reality.  A sizable portion of the rulebook explains how pathogens work in the context of the gameplay.  This game appears to be a true labor of love, but doesn't quite succeed in making the academic alphabet soup of biology approachable for the layman.

There are no new mechanics here but there is a very clever use of existing ones to make an interesting model of the immune system. I'm not surprised that the KS campaign had teacher bundles. The science is accurately reproduced but is not overwhelming and you don't need to know anything about the biology to play (but you will know more after you finish).
I might have given this a slightly lower rating as a game, but I was so impressed with the way the phases of immunology are portrayed that i think it deserves more respect. Excellent theme and way more exciting than Dominion!

The real scientific names on the cards and tokens can look quite daunting at first, but peel back a layer and you reveal a simple-to-play, quick-playing deckbuilder. It takes a little time to setup (short for a deckbuilder) and it plays quick, often won't exceed an hour. Our second play with 3 players took just 45 minutes after understanding all the rules.

As a deckbuilder, it's really entry-level in terms of difficulty and the various actions a card can do is easy to understand since everyone gets a rule card that details what each symbol means. The main barrier (see what I did there?) to entry is the scientific terms, so at first glance it makes everything fairly daunting to remember and learn. I imagine this game is easily playable for younger players rather than 14+ if not for the scientific terms.

Overall, great entry deckbuilder with a very unique theme.

LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! 

The artwork is fantastic. The science is accurate. The game is challenging. Even my science-allergic husband enjoys it.

This game is not only a fun deck builder but educational.  I want to play this one more and have found myself reading all the cards during turns.

Great deck building game that is both fun and educational. The mechanics and flavor text teach valuable lessons about immunology and pathology without being pedantic or sacrificing fun. Easily one of the better deck builders to date.

Really good advanced deck building game with a pathogen building sub-game.

I feel like I genuinely learned something about microbiology while still having a lot of fun.

The Immune Response cards are random and can be very punishing making it harder for new players to compete. But even experienced players can have their best laid plans trashed by an unfavourable draw.

Cooperative and competitive modes for this deck-builder where players develop pathogens to attack the body.  My first playthrough we tried cooperative mode, and made sure that we were attacking each tract equally, so that by the time the body got to attack, we were only two rounds away from victory and didn't feel like we were under threat.  

The second playthrough was four-player competitive.  This time, the immune system was able to attack each players' pathogens, and we almost went through the first immune response deck, but the tract we all attacked was defeated with half a dozen cards still in the first response deck.

The game is not deadly enough, and I'm not sure that it can be fixed by house ruling.  As a deck builder, each player should be cycling through their deck frequently at first, and less often as they add more cards.  This doesn't happen, as the body was dead within four rounds.

This is my first deck building game and I thought it was a decent introduction to the mechanic. The art on this game is very nice, but is limited in variation. The rulebook was a tiny confusing, but after reading through it twice, it covers all the bases and any little questions people typically come up with during a rules explanation. What I especially like about the game is how hard it is. Beating the immune system is wicked hard to do, and I normally lose in solo, even when in "normal mode" and following the custom rules for each mode. 

Besides that, I really enjoy the game on many levels. The scientific accuracy is great to me, and especially how the tracts interact. Cards are well valued, and others are a little shaky on their price vs. effect. My bias lays a decent bit in my enjoyment as I'm currently a biology student, so it's really fun playing a game with some of the harder topics I've studied (and to be real I still don't think i understand all of them.

A good deckbuilding game, with two different phases. I like the way you get rid of the basic cards of the initial deck but sometimes the specialization strategy seems to be pretty dominant and obvious. It's light, fast, good artwork, peculiar theme and quite challenging. I would love to have more inmune response different challenges.

Deck builder, where players are viruses trying to attack host human. Theme is heavily integrated everywhere. I'm not sure why to add the game end condition where everyone loses.

Played with 3 players - really enjoyed this map and the different timing of determining player order. And the box is blue! A good addition to the PG stable.

I was very fortunate to play the German version of this not-yet-released game.
Definitely different. Some cities can't even be built in for the first time until phase two, which is only 5 cities in a 6-player game. Restocking found us being able to buy Nukes as cheap as $1 in phase two!
Big change in strategy since turn order doesn't change until AFTER power plants are auctioned! This one's a keeper!

Another excellent map. this one has few ares with real growth ability. everywhere is just so expensive to make more than about 4 connections. Allows for a very satisfying early and mid game. The rules changes on the map make it hard to manipulate the turn order as easily as you can on other maps, which offers more decisions. Very interesting.

These boards all seem the same to me.  I do like the rule change though where you rearrange turn order after plants are purchased.  That should be a base rule across all versions IMO.

I really love Powergrid, but don't think much of this bastardised version. Changing player order after the auction (as opposed to before) makes it a little more random and devalues planning (since you can't be sure of player order unless you're in the last auction). Also, removing 2 plants if no one bids clears a midgame stall faster, devaluing players who planned to perform during a stall. All up, its a nice new map, but the tension has been watered down. Possibly to appeal to a more casual gamer.

The rule changes in this edition appear to have been designed to make the game slightly easier to learn.  By putting the "change turn order" step after the auction you eliminate the need to have an exception for the first round.  By eliminating the removal of a plant in the market when someone builds to that many cities you take away a rule that people tend to forget.

Despite this, these rules are just as interesting as the original ones (and in fact, they may be even more interesting.)

Played this version now, like it. I feel more comfortable playing this style of game, and need to get some practise in.

RATING: 8
The game is very close to regular Power Grid.  The new map is kind of interesting, especially with the "off map" cities.

I'm not sure I like the player order readjust rule after the power plant auction.  It definitely changes the game substantially - I think it makes it a little more forgiving.  But I would be just as happy to play this map as any of the others I've played, so - 8's all around!

I really like the new rule change or twist, from the base game, of changing the new player turn order after the auctions phase.  Players with tied connected cities have something extra to think about during the auction process.

RATING: 6
I'm still not certain what to think about the modification of changing the turn order only after the power plant auction.  It does throw a wrench into the normal thinking process for the game.  The only other discernable difference in this game besides the other German map would be the special cities where you can only enter in stage 2 and 3.

Another game I took a chance on and I'm enjoying it so far.  Lots of layers in the game make it really interesting to play, and I think it will be well worth the effort in learning it.  I like the theme and components, so I hope I'll be able to find people to play with, since it really is better with more players.

I bough this from EnBW for several reasons: It was (relatively) cheap, as several members of our group already own the original I though this would hold some novelty value and last but not least I work for a competitor of EnBW (what a rebel, eh?)

It's just as good as the original; the maps and rule "tweaks" make playslightly different but don't detract at all.  Excellent - and thank you EnBW!

RATING: 9
Apart from a different map and phase 2 starting at 6 stations rather than 7, the only real difference is that the turn order re-setting and auction phases are switched around, meaning you can build with gay abandon and not lose your last-to-auction privilege. A pretty key difference to take advantage of. Other than that, the feel is the same, so same rating as the original.

Dato che il gioco non cambia, considero questo come un voto alla mappa della regione del Baden-Wurttemberg. 
Una mappa equilibrata e ben fatta, con l'introduzione della novità data dalle città con due zone che si attivano a partire dallo step 2. Dopo Germania e Francia, una delle mappe più equilibrate dell'intera serie.
L'ordine di gioco, rispetto al Power Grid base, si fa dopo l'asta. Sembra una cosa da poco, ma cambia completamente le strategie. Voto più che positivo (anche alla EnBW, che sa quali gadget produrre per i propri clienti!).

Kooky version where you reorder after the auction.  Fun variant.  Otherwise business as usual.

The differences to basic rules are:

* Off-zone cities with two spaces are only available in steps two and three.
* If no power plant is sold the lowest 2 are removed instead of just one.
* Power plants are not removed from the actual market due to someone connecting more cities than what the plants number is.
* Player order is adjusted after auction, i.e. phases one and two are swapped.
* On the B-W map step 2 is triggered if someone has 9/6/5 cities for 2/3-5/6 players

The phase2/3-only cities are somewhat interesting, but I'm not sure there's a huge effect. The plant removals also doesn't seem to be a big change. But the simple phase 1-2 swap seems to be pretty significant ... I like it (even though I couldn't seem to use it effectively in my first play)!

Blue yet Green. Like Power Grid pushed through a portal from some alternate universe. A universe where electricity companies do things like create awesome promotional games.

OK. It's basically Power Grid, with a different map, but it comes in mighty handy when the original game wears out or expansion maps won't fit in the base game box.

I can't imagine what rubbish I'll come up with to justify getting Megawatts.

another Power Grid "map" with minor rules tweaks, released as a complete game. Most noticable differences: turn order is calculated immediately after plant buying phase, step 2 starts a bit earlier.

I record plays for this edition at the entry for the regular Power Grid game.

? Pretty much identical to the original Power Grid, just containing one additional plan.

RATING: 8
The two most notable differences for me in this edition are the turn order changes and the "off-board" cities which you can't build into until the latter two phases.  The first change adds one more dimension to the auction since play order is now determined after the bidding, it becomes slightly more important to look ahead to the power plants if you are trying to jockey for the position to buy resources and to build first.  The second just adds a distinct flavor to the map.

If you like Power Grid, you can't go wrong with this.  Although I don't really see the sense of paying so much for the EnBW edition if you already own the base game.  The only thing new you're getting is one map.

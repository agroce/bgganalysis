RATING: 9
Whilst my fellow players were slightly underwhelmed (one objected to the notion that digs might be a bit hit and miss) I thought it was smashing. A really strong rendering of an engaging theme, and the time/turn mechanic is very satisfying.

Likely to be my best purchase from Essen 05.

Great gateway game in the mould of 80 Days or Ticket to Ride.  The digs and date track are both excellently handled. But big availability issue.

First play, my two opponents left for two big digs in Southern Europe in year 3 I was left alone to mug up in the academies of the North, becoming the leading expert if four of the five cultures and gathering enough points for a close victory.  The ever depleting sites and the time line are both excellent design features and for a run of what I am told is 104 copies the production is excellent.

Second game, came a distant fourth, not really sure why other than poor digging.  One thing which I find difficult in a number of games is remembering who is playing which colour.  JvT was one of those games.  This could be solved by instead of having 20 similar excavation permissions there was one set for each player with the background to the cards corresponding to player colours.  This would help to identify who was who without any additional cost.  New publisher please take note.

Just let me start by saying, that the luck of the game doesn't bother me.

The main reason I play games is to have fun, and part of that fun can be matching wits with other players, but a large part of it can also be matching wits with the game engine itself. This is why games like Shadows over Camelot and Lord of the Rings are fun - they setup difficult tasks that take planning, execution, timing, and luck to overcome. Jenseits is not a cooperative game, but like a cooperative game, much of the fun from the game comes from doing well in spite of the obstacles in front of you. In JvT, those obstacles most often take the form of some measure of bad luck.

I wouldn't want to play games like JvT all the time, as it can get rather frustrating fighting that uphill battle too often, but if I am in the right mood for it, a fun game like JvT is right up my alley.

Almost fantastic game with well-crafted mechanics that fit perfectly with the theme. The clever systems, however, are made somewhat redundant by the feeling that whoever has the best luck when digging (drawing a certain number of cards off the top of the site decks) will win the game. If the game was shorter, this would not be such a problem. Would play it again though.

RATING: 4
I had never heard of this game before.  One of the players got it out of the club library and we sat down for a 4 player game.  Learning the rules went rather smoothly with only a mild hiccup here and there.

I really enjoyed this game through the first half of play.  I loved the time track (ala 80 Days) and really just about everything else.  I had a minor dig here or there and the random draws were average to slightly above average.  I was really plotting for a a back to back major dig at an untouched site that had a high ratio of point chits, while many were high value chits.

The time arrived for me to execute the dig.  I performed the back to back digs and had 18 draws (both digs combined).  I figured an average or even slightly below average draw would still bring me victory.  As it turned out, I used up a vast amount of my weeks on the time track, my special dig again card. I ended up drawing 2 low value scoring chits in 18 tries.  This from an untouched site.  In dice speak, I essentially rolled all one's.  Horrible!  I then tried some short digs at other sites to compensate and drew average.  I ended up losing the game by 5 points.

I prefer games where poor or superior play on my part determines my victory or loss.  I felt I played a very solid game strategy that was trashed by an astronomically powerful random factor in the game.

In summary, I love everything about the game except the overpowering random draw aspect.  For me, that totally ruins the game and it is not one that I will play again.  If you don't mind playing games where the random draw will generally determine victory, then you'll probably like this game.

RATING: 8
Quite light, with a strong element of luck - however theme is great and it feels like you have control, especially if you use the optional rules like it a lot. Thebes the reprint has much nicer bits and the ease of chits from a bag over shuffling decks of cards mean it's the one that gets played, although I prefer the way exhibitions works in Jenseits von Theben, 

** Update, got a trade offer I couldn't refuse :)
But I'd definitely play this again (or the reprint, which I still own).

Awesome use of theme.  I really like games where you "feel" the theme and this is one of them.  The game is also a lot of fun.  Yes there is luck involved but I think it goes with the theme-- this pyramid was already hit by grave robbers so you didn't find anything, the next player goes to a different pyramid and finds a bunch of artifacts.  And there is enough luck so that the game is fun rather than a showdown of who can do more quick analysis in their head.

All of the mechanics work.  Dig vs learn.  Move around vs. wait to show your stuff at the exhibition.

Awesome archeology game -- it is great fun running around Europe trying to dig up items of value and show them off.  I love the balancing aspect of spending time to improve your digging capabality vs. digging as often as you can.  Very cool game and the game length is perfect (60 - 90 minutes).  HUGE random elements, but that just adds to the charm for me.  Definitely works better if you structure the deck so that the exhibits are only in the bottom 2/3rds of the deck - gives you time to get the first few digs in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fun treasure hunting game which incorporates the time dimension exceptionally well (only 'around the world in 80 days' comes anywhere close). There's a lot of luck in the digging phase but it fits the theme and still works.  We use the hard digging tables and a house rule that adds one week to the length of an expedition for every treasure discovered - that seems to even things out a bit without fundamentaly changing the game and fits well thematically - if you haven't found anything just pack your bags and leave, but if you have you'll need to spend a bit longer extracting the artifacts. [second edition]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
My rating is wandering a little bit ... so let's take another shot at the bottom line here. a) The game has some fun elements. How long to hold out accumulating knowledge before digging, and schedulding your digs to be finished in times for exhibits. b) The influence of luck on the game is huge, and while some elements are reasonably acceptable because the players still have some control (the actual digging), some - like the timing of certain action cards and the exhibits - are both arbitrary and overwhelming. Too many exhibits early, and the game is dumb. Too many shovels or general knowledge cards late, and the whole thing can complete sieze up well before the end. In neither game I played were the last 26 weeks worth playing. One game, we saw the majority of the exhibits in the first half-year, and everyone thought the game was broken. Second game (with a different group), things were more even and everyone basically had fun, although we still all agreed that fundamentally the game didn't really work.

So ... the game is about two ideas short of actually being good. But there is some neat stuff in there, so it's not like it's not worth playing. But it's an extreme example of an experience game, and even then it has some issues, the late-game lock up being the most problematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This one is a lot of fun!  I don't mind the randomness of the digging at all, as it adds kind of a push-your-luck aspect to the dig.  Do I dig for 3 weeks to get just a few cards, or stay for 8 weeks to dig for more cards?  I also loved the exhibition cards, as they often throw a wrench in your plans.  You'd rather be out collecting information and digging, but you don't want to lose those points for potentially winning an exhibition either!  Great fun!

RATING: 6
For me, the game has too much luck for how "Euro" the game feels. You get hit by luck two ways and I really don't like games like this (such as Battlelore).  The luck comes at you - 1) in the card draw and 2) in the tile bag.  The tile bag is not like Tigris and Euphrates either.  In T&E you get tiles and then have to make decisions on how to use the tiles you pulled.  In Theben you just get points or you get screwed.  The really interesting mechanic in this game is the initiative track which I hope to see used in more games in the future.

RATING: 6
The theme integration on this game about archaeology is admirable, as one does feel like an archaeologist out researching different cultures, procuring shovels, and digging at sites. This is why it receives a 6 despite being an out and out luckfest due to the mechanics of digging where you draw a certain number of cards from the deck of the site you're at and hope that you turn up artifacts instead of pottery shards. I don't think the game would work or feel right without the completely random decks, but they really make the game overwhelmingly luck driven. Neat concept though and I don't think I like the idea of trying to "fix" the randomness...the game is what it is, if you don't enjoy it, I don't think trying to patch the dig deck distribution is your answer...just play something else.

Bought two copies to save on shipping. Second one for trading purposes. I'm going to trade both copies. The initial part of the game is excellent with good choices to make and attention to tactics required. But when it comes to searching for the treasures their is too much luck for me. This could be a great game for someone else but not for me.

Would be better if a bit shorter.  Nice mechanic with the time track.

RATING: 9
Wow, what a brilliant representation of a theme. Players are archaeologists competing for artifacts buried under five different dig sites. At the end of the game, players earn victory points for the artifacts they have found, the knowledge they have gained, and the exhibitions they have won, which then determines the winner of the game. Each turn the player can take one of four actions: move to another location, choose a card that corresponds to the current location, start an excavation, or pass. Much like [gameid=12681], each action will take a specific number of weeks and the player furthest back in the timeline is always the first in turn order. This presents some interesting situations, because when one person goes for a high value card or a lengthy dig, they will move to the front of the queue, which gives other players potentially multiple actions before catching up and then passing the leader. Players collect cards at various European cities to gain knowledge of each dig site and to provide various special actions. If the player has the proper knowledge cards, an excavation can be made. During an excavation, the player cross-references the number of corresponding knowledge cards they have to the number of weeks they want to spend in order to determine the number of cards to pull from a random assortment. Cards will either provide Artifact VP cards or garbage that gets shuffled back into the deck, which means that each successive dig has a higher chance of pulling up garbage. Whenever an Exhibition card is drawn, it is placed on the timeline by the specified number of weeks ahead of the trailing player. Any player at the proper location at the specified time can exhibit their Artifacts. Players add each of a particular type or types of Artifacts with the roll of a die. The player with the highest total gets the Exhibition card, which is worth victory points at the end of the game. As I stated earlier, I think the game mechanics support the theme quite well; the timeline usage, the diminishing returns for excavations, and the exhibition of artifacts. Once you manage to decipher the rules, the game itself clips along at a good pace. The artwork and production in the Prinz Spiele version of the game that I have leave a little to be desired, but the new version looks to be an improvement. The game is innovative, well thought out, and it plays quickly. This is a really solid design and I highly recommend it. It is one of my top ten favorite games of 2004.

RATING: 6
Random treasure drawing, random knowledge/tool choices and random exhibitions. And yet... table lookups for optimising digging, "action point" counting and recounting to time exhibitions and the end game.
Is it just me, or do these two game concepts (pure-luck card drawing and maths intensive calculations) not belong in the same game?

Rating may be a little higher, because it's got some fantastically fun mechanisms.  The only drawback is the high luck factor of the dig.  But even that is thematically correct.

RATING: 8
Players spend time (weeks, basically money) acquiring knowledge and equipment to outfit their archaeological expedition to up to five ancient sites.  The sites are represented by five decks of "treasure" cards, that are also filled with a lot of dirt!  Time spent on site allows cards to be flipped and hopefully treasure found.  Points at the end of the game come from treasure, winning exhibitions, attending congresses (collecting a type of card during the game), and knowledge gained.  Belongs in the same category of "experience" games such as Safe Return Doubtful and Legend of the Lost Dutchman.  Very good, and really enjoyable game.  Played with "clear the board", "lots of treasure", and "hard excavation table" variants.

Queen Edition: stunning, lovely job.  Cleaned up some of the slightly messy bits - exhibitions are cleaner (no weeks offset or battle, just a sliding track and first there claims it); single assistants and shovels now do something; bonus for first dig at each site, etc.  Great game.

RATING: 7
My opinion of this is a bit nebulous still. I was bitten with a huge urge to play this and for about two years I've ached to give it a spin. I had a few niggly gripes after my only playing, but the advanced rules [clearing the cards by spending two weeks, clearing cards after an exhibition, and the tougher digging table] address every issue that tarnish my opinion. 
 
The game is an amazing self-published effort with a fresh, fun exploration theme that really works. I look forward to trying with all advanced rules in play! Rating will probably rise after this.

Received in the mail, 11/25/05. First played, 12/01/05. Three player. Fun, interesting, but not a classic in the vein of E&T, Attika. I give it a 7 so far. I like exploring games, so the luck of what you find was not a turn off as it is appropriate to the game. But it does keep it from being a highly strategic game. Of course, more games under my belt, and I might discover strategies I don't know about.

Queen version:  I like this a lot.   There *is* a deal of randomness in the tile draws, but for me that's part of the flavour of the game, and adds to my fun - waiting with bated breath to see if I (or an opponent) pulls out a decent haul.

After a recent game, a certain published game designer of my acquaintance expressed concerns over the randomness and we briefly discussed ideas about how to partially mitigate a poor draw with by a compensatory mechanism, e.g. if one had already dug at a site, and in that previous draw pulled mostly "dirt" tiles, this would be recorded, and on any fresh dig there one would not count a certain (small) number of dirt tiles towards the number allowed - simulating knowing where *not* to dig :-) ; or allowing a discount in weeks taken on the dig for pulling a majority (or totality) of dirt tiles - simulating it being quicker to dig through an area with no finds, as one doesn't have to be so careful, record everything, etc.  However, I do like the game very much as it is, and it may over-complicate things to add more weight.

One thing:  So far the exhibitions haven't seemed to play a major part, but maybe I need to think about how to use them more carefully.

Our most complex game played together is now Reef Encounter.

I'd play it again, although I agree with many here that it really is too highly luck driven.  My biggest complaints:

1 - if the exhibits come out early, it is broken (saw this in my one playing)
2 - the optional rule to take out all the rocks and replace the artifacts with rocks as they are pulled REALLY felt broken.  Give a massive bonus to the first person to that location, then screw everyone else to the point that it is folly to dig in that location again until almost the end of the game
3 - The luck the luck!  Whoever gets awesome draws will win.  This is especially true if you play with the afore mentioned optional rule...which heavily gifts the first person in, but god help you if you draw really crappy.  There isn't a balance of negative impact to positive impact if playing with this optional rule.

This is a really excellent exploration game. The theme is very true to the gameplay and a lot of fun.  There seem to always be too many things to do and not nearly enough time. The randomness and luck can be a little more than some may like but the optional rules in the 2nd printing work really well to help counter that, but I don't mind a little luck, the theme almost requires it.

RATING: 8
Very nice archeology game. Strong in theme and with some clever mechanics.
I agree with some of the comments that the real issue with this game is the huge variance between the values of the artifacts. I like the additional 'showmanager' rule that addresses the endgame problem with the board filling with useless shovels and assistants. I think the alternate deck setup rule doesn't really reduce the luck of the draw; it only favors the first player who digs in each location (which might be thematically correct).

Very fun game - the luck element of the archaeological excavations meshes with the theme.  To me, the luck is not overwhelming and does not decrease my enjoyment of the game.  It seems like a game that is best meant to be played quickly and lightly, without pondering too much about the best move.  I'd like to play this with three.  If we could finish in 40 minutes, I think that would be ideal.  It will be nice to see this rereleased with higher production values - it certainly deserves it.  Still, there are a lot of fun choices to make, weighing your options between acquiring more knowledge and going out to dig stuff up.  The added time pressure of the exhibitions makes this really fun.

A very unique and interesting game. There can be quite a bit of AP while players plan their actions. From my perspective, the luck doesn't come so much from the digging as it does from the value of the artifacts. (A huge variance between 1 and 7) Overall I thought it was one of the better games I've played recently.

RATING: 6
2nd edition. Now I've played a few times. Fun game.  Loved the clever way of dealing with time.  The theme and mechanics mesh nicely.  The components are pretty good, especially considering this is a homemade game.  The board is a bit flimsy, but functional.  The cards are mostly fine, but some of the art decisions were questionable.  However, the overall gameplay is nicely tied to the game mechanics and draws you in as you play.  The 4-player game is one year shorter, which made achievements more urgent.  I like the 3-player game a bit more, as you have more time to work in the field and then get to an exhibition.  I also prefer the standard deck construction.  Finally, we have been happy with the charts included in the box, and have never felt the need to make the game harder by using the revised charts made available by the author.

The archaelogical theme is extremely appealing and fabulous.  Many will not like the randomness in JvT.  Only played once with three and I suspect that it may be best with four.  One variant I would like to see implemented to JvT is that the first round or two (of play, not years) of city cards are "free" of any exhibit cards (i.e.- count out 10 or 12 of the top city cards and insert exhibits into rest of deck).  The game is random enough, so this solves the problem of having exhibits not come out too early.  The game plays sub-optimally different when exhibits are randomly drawn prematurly since they tend to get wiped out b/c no one will be able to get them accomplished).  I really "want" to like JvT more but the mechanics don't offer a high degree of skill versus luck ratio but it's fun with the right crowd.

Not sure why it has the high rating it does...while I would play the game again, it really wasn't all that compelling or interesting and puts too much emphasis on luck of the draw.  The game is about risk management and hedging your bets as you gather knowledge and dig at the various sites.

Self-published, Second Edition. Wonderfully thematic game with unique mechanics. I love the implementation of time in years and turn order; and the tough decisions of gaining the knowledge to dig better versus digging now. Highly random, you can invest in pulling more cards on a dig and still get all dirt. But, its still a very interesting game, the advance rules help with that a bit.

I'm most impressed by how well the gameplay fit the archaeology theme.  Players compete in a two year span to uncover the most ancient relics.  Movement and actions take time in weeks and time is managed in a mechanic similar to that in Neuland.  One can travel around the major European cities go learn more about the ancient digging sites (improving efficiency, etc).  Once a player goes to a site to dig they can decide how long to dig for.  Time spent digging added to modifiers determines how many cards they turn over.  Each card will either be bunk (dirt) or contain an artifact.  The dirt cards are added back to the deck for that particular site (making the odds tougher for the next player hoping to find something there).  Victory points are earned by gathering relics and by displaying the best relics at exhibits: players who arrive at the city where the exhibit occurs, on the day it occurs, with the artifacts that match the exhibit's theme can compete.  The advanced rules help clean up some of the luck players found fault with in the original rules.

I liked it but i feel like the game's main flaw is too few exhibit cards and that it is chance when they come up. I guess more so the chance that they won't come up at the end which renders the endgame as pointless and dull. I thought that the first half was building up knowledge and stuff and the second half would be racing around to exhibits.

I'd sure like a copy of this, but there's a fair amount of German text, and the two print-runs so far have been 300 copies each (or less).  Therefore, not much chance of getting a hold of one for a reasonable price.  I sure hope Rio Grande or even one of the larger German publishers decides to license this design and print a few thousand copies!

[b]Update:[/b] No longer on my wishlist, as I'll be picking up a copy of the Queen reprint ([i]Thebes[/i]) as soon as it's available.  Many thanks to Peter Prinz and [i]Queen Games[/i] for making my wish come true!

It's a pity that I'm torn between two extremes on this game - on one hand, I like the game - the game design is very stream-lined, the time-based turn order works great, and 2nd edition components are very nice. On the other hand, the random draw puts me down. It's not that it kills the game in general. It's just too easy to imagine an incident where someone loses all interests in the game because of unfortunate draws. This is very close to a deal breaker, especially considering that the game is targeted to more casual gamers than serious gamers.

Two 3-player games worked very well. Certainly has a major luck component that really turns some people off, but 'luck' is 'tested' often enough for it to have a chance to average out. The geometric progression of Kongresses(like Aristocrats in St Petersburg and in Hacienda) might be unbalancing. I really like the Exhibition aspect of the game. Want to play again soon.

While I feel that there is a lot of luck in this game, I liked that it was short and that the theme seemed to fit the mechanics.  There were always a lot of interesting decisions, and the push-your-luck element of the digs keeps the game tense.  I would like to see the deck split in two and have the exhibitions all stuck in the 2nd half, as most the exhibitions came way too early in our game.

RATING: 6
The Queen version has nice components and the game looks great. Many have commented on the luck factor and that indeed shows on the excavation part of the game. You can make an excellent pull or nothing at all. It's too random since it might decide who will win the game. Our first game took over two hours which is too long for a game which is decided by luck. Some of the mechanics/action cards seemed pasted on. For example the cards you collect in a similar way than the collecting of aristocrats in St Petersburg. The turn order where you can do actions if your are the last in order is quite clever and reminds me of Around the World in 80 Days. It can also become quite tedious when after a 12 week dig you have to wait for the other players to complete their turn.

Queen Games version. Very thematic - I like the digging out of the bags. Reminds me of the Kosmos Around the World in 80 Days - I like the turn order being based upon the time track. What prevents me from rating this higher is the large impact the luck of the dig has on the scores. I've seen one player remove 20 points from the first dig of a bag (with eight total tokens), and another player remove three points with the first pull of the bag (also with eight tokens). This leaves a somewhat sour taste I assure you. (Update: first pull - one treasure from 11 tokens!) I just feel that the distribution of points be a little flatter - the number of total points in the bag should remain the same as it currently is. There would still be the excitement of pulling (say) four points from the bag with a small dig of a token, but it would reduce the luck element to a more tolerable level in my opinion. A balanced game seems best, with smaller digs to leave yourself able to jump around and get opportune cards as they come up.

RATING: 8.5
2nd Edition. A home-made effort by Peter Prinz. The components are laser printed and are quite uniform in quality.

Players are archaeologists travelling around the Greece and the near east trying to dig for valuable artifacts. These give VPs. Along the way, they can pick up equipment to help their digs.

The gameplay features innovative 'time' movement mechanics that are reminiscent of Neuland (Eggert). Players move their 'time' marker along a scale for taking actions (travel, digging, picking up equipment).

The latest set of rules have optional rules to reduce the luck factor. 

Gripes:
There is a little AP towards the end when players are trying to calculate the best time to spend on digs.

It's slightly fiddly; all the site cards are too small and clutter the table. The spread between the value 1 and 7 treasures can make or break the game.

But I love the theme and mechanics. Good stuff.

Also own new Queen version.

Wow, this one really impressed me.  Initially, I was afraid that even with the "advanced rules" this game would be too random.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a high degree of control here (with the "advanced rules").  This really captures the theme perfectly, and it has a wonderful sense of movement and time.  Many differing paths to victory make this a real joy.  I love the action/turn order system.  

Next time I play, I'm going to have to seed the exhibits into the the deck  so that they come out a little later and a little more even.  (Split the deck into four divide the exhibit cards so that they go even shuffled into two decks. Place one exhibitless deck on the top and one at the bottom).

This is a solid little game.  I really like the mechanisms of travelling to various places to acquire the special items and the knowledge about civilizations for research.  Also really liked the use of the time scale around the board. Based on one play with two, though I would like to play it more with a larger compliment of players.  This would be great if a US publisher could pick up the rights and re-print it.  I think it would do well in a broader market.

I really enjoyed my two plays of this game.  The use of time as currency appeals to me, for some reason.  I also enjoyed the exploration of the stacks, the race against the clock for the purposes of travel, and the special abilities on the cards.  The cards offered tangible benefits that were certainly worth seeking without overtly unbalancing the game in someone's favor.  The only factor that initially gave me pause was the luck of the draw in the stacks.  Although increases in technology (ok, more shovels) and research as the game goes on will enhance your odds, you can still invest heavily (in terms of time) in a dig and come up empty-handed.  I see this as thematically consistent, however, and it is therefore a good kind of luck (even if it's bad).

An engaging game with one one serious flaw: The luck factor is extremely high in relation to the game length, and hits both in terms of what cards are available to players AND in the excavations. High luck factors of this magnitude are a bit more palatable in quick "filler" games. The positives still outweigh the negatives here, though; the game has interesting mechanics, a ton of player options, many paths to victory and a theme that fits well.

I have had a chance to play this game many times now in 2, 3 and 4 player mode.  This is a great game! I love it.  I really had originally thought it might rise up the coveted rank of 10 but after many plays I think it really sits well right here at 9.  If there were a few more decisions to make each turn it might go up to a 10.  There is NOTHING wrong with this game do not misunderstand what I saying here.  PLAY JvT!

UPDATE: Queen Edition of the game plays just as nicely in all honesty. It's a bit more "user friendly" if you will with the new exhibits even if they are not quite as "Cool" once you figure them out. You simply MUST play with the 2nd edition rule of pulling 7 random chips out of each bag and not looking at them until the end of the game. Hell so much fun is derived from checking out what got discarded! Moving this game's rank to the coveted '10' spot. I'm feeling generous today but in truth if I still like this game THIS much it deserves it!

2nd Prinz Edition.  This game is great fun, and the theme goes with the mechanisms so well.  A lot of luck, but who cares.  We play with a coupld of the author's suggested variants, namely clearing the cards after an exposition, and the extra card draw after an exposition.  We tried the different mix of excavation cards, but that made it just a race to be the first to dig at a site - whoever was first reaped huge reward and then after that it was quite easy to work out your odds of getting something (and they weren't that good).  So we stick to the original  excavation card rules, and enjoy it much more that way.

One of my daughter's favorites.  Good the first time with two people using the standard rules, but I think it might be a little more fun with four people and the variant rules to reduce randomness.  Great theme!!

Nope.  I was wrong - the original randomness is more fun than the variant.  The variant puts a huge premium on getting to the dig sites first.  Later digs become somewhat irrelevant.

(Trade Interest: low) it's pretty good at evoking the excitement of digging in ruins for ancient artifacts -- i.e. it's mostly not exciting, unless you find something :)  but i like some of the systems, and that you have to build up your knowledge before you can do an excavation.  also, the time system works a lot better than Around the World in 80 Days, which i didn't like at all.  after playing a few more times, i've come to the conclusion that the swings in luck are just too great, and so i've reduced my rating, and am now interested in trading away the game.

WOW! What a great game. I love the time investment aspect of action selection/resolution. I love reaching in and digging out artifacts & dirt from the dig sites. I love the variety of resources you can leverage in the different cities. I love the production value. Yes, there is a LOT of luck involved based on which cards are available on your turn, and how well you draw from the bags - but the game plays quickly, offers some nice push-your-luck decisions and is an enjoyable experience. Very impressed, and a game I will purchase as soon as it is available.

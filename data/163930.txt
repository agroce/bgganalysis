This is a great game that is enjoyable in the way that Love Leeter is, using process of elimination and deduction. This plays better as a two player than Love Letter.

RATING: 6
Sort of fun, but seems very luck dependent and little you can do to mitigate that. The production looks cheap and the graphic design is poor - the ugly black plastic blocks obliterate everyone's view of the board layout and the images are hard to see. Forgettable.

RATING: 8.8
I really like this game. The first few round are sometimes awkward with new players but once every body understand the principle it gets really fun. The scoring is a bit random but honestly it doesn't really matter. This is the kind of game that is fun and I like games that are FUN

RATING: 5
I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

While I found the components and the idea of the game pretty nice, Abraca...what? ended up being nothing special for me. The deduction and the bluffing elements are neat, but there's not actually many things you can do here... so the game pretty much ends up being exactly the same every time. It can give a nice couple of plays, but I'm sure that the longevity is pretty low.

Abraca...what? is a family weight game and I had some fun playing it, but there's absolutely much better games in the same genre. This one is simply mediocre. Probably if it was a small portable card game instead of a medium-sized box, I would like it much better and maybe I could even consider buying it. What a pity!

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A unique twist on the whole indian poker idea.  This one also does have a ton of meta gaming going on, which I thought made it more fun.  I think the theme on this one was also neat, and while I was kind of up in the air on this one after reading the rules, it turned out to be a lot of fun, and its a keeper.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
My daughter really enjoys this game and it is doing well teaching her the risk/reward aspect of push your luck. My mom is a big fan of the game as well.

Playing by the actual point rules makes the game overstay it's welcome at times. My family often treats each round as a filler length game.

RATING: 6
It's not great, but it's very good.  I just wish it was easier to get played.  It can either be played as a great casual drinking game or a very good, deep Hanabi-style competitive double-think game.  

Based on what you see and what other people have and haven't called, you can make a probabilistic guess as to the best thing to call.  However, once people start getting comfortable with the game, calling things they know they probably can't do just to throw other people off is a neat strategy.  I'd love to play this enough to play it this way, but the "great drinking game" version will probably be my limit.

My only issue with the game is that since people aren't working so hard to control their expressions and reactions, they give more away then they should, giving other players an advantage.  It's not awful in a drinking game, but myeh.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Abraca...what? turns Hanabi into a competitive game, rather than a cooperative one. Players each have a hand of numbered "spells" that only their opponents can see. They take turns attempting to cast spells, succeeding only if they have that type of spell in their hand. 

The design seems clever, but I was less enamored by the gameplay than I expected to be. It was the first game of the day, so perhaps we were all just tired? I'd be open to trying it again to see if it improves.

Some tile-counting, some push-your-luck. I doubt you'd ever get Hanabi-mind-reading-awesomeness out of the game, but I don't think it's trying for that. It's light and quick.

I like that there are reasons for guessing particular spells other than raw mathematical likelihood and power-of-spell - life totals and point totals can change what might be most worth trying for.

Ce jeu est un jeu Famille ... ou S ... ou Famille (le débat fait rage au groupe jeux :) ). Dans tous les cas, c'est un jeu assez simple, où vous allez lancer des sorts, avec une mécanique à la Hanabi. Quoi ? Vous ne connaissez pas Hanabi non plus ? Sérieux, si vous êtes bénévoles depuis un mois et que vous n'avez jamais joué à Hanabi, vous avez raté votre vie (ludique). Heureusement qu'il y a une soirée bénévole ce soir pour pallier à ça...). Vous verrez donc les pierres magiques, utiles pour lancer vos sorts, des autres joueurs, mais ... pas les vôtres ! Il faudra donc déduire vos pierres pour espérer lancer la boule de feu qui va bien et cramer les autres joueurs.

The only good thing I can say about Abraca…What? is that the components work. The blocks stay there and you don’t have to hold them in your hand. The spells are not balanced (especially numbers 6 and 7) and the deduction is not enough for me to keep me focused.

RATING: 7
Fun deduction/blind Indian game. You are all trying to cast spells to either eliminate another player or cast all your spelled in 1 round

I liked the concept of the last man standing variant but it makes the scoring really low so the game starts to get long. Base game is a bit shorter than I'd prefer but that's ok. It's really fun to try and "cast" what you think you have. Especially playing mind games with people and the ancient dragon

Count all the visible spells and then guess. Charmless and slow. Instead of Hanabi's deduction, the blind cards in this game serve to make you feel like the right play is obvious and everyone at the table (including you) is dumb for being so bad at the game.

Redeeming factor: One spell had an owl on it.

Kids-ish game. It kind of has a deduction element, but there's enough missing information that it still basically comes down to guessing which spells you have. Sometimes you can eliminate possibilities, but otherwise it's just a crap shoot whether you have one thing or the other. They seem to have gratuitously changed the name from Abraca...what? to Abracada...what?, which I think it a change for the worse.

Really simple deduction game with stratego like stands to hold the spells so only your opponent can see them this time. For some reason you're a wizard that has forgotten all his spells.

RATING: 7.75
Take the limited options for hurting your opponent from Love Letter, add in the inability to see your own hand from Hanabi, and then wrap it up in high quality pieces and you have an idea of what this game it about. It can be a light, fun game or intensive strategy depending on the players or that round -- but the game offers enjoyment for each. A great light game to have in one's collection.

PLUS: ease of learning, enjoyable anyway you play, quality of pieces
MINUS: art makes some of the numbers hard to read -- especially given the way the holders are configured

Abracada...What? is really just an overproduced guessing game.  There's so much knowledge not available to the players from the beginning, and by the time information does come out in the round, you're probably already dead or wishing you were.  Really didn't care for this one at all.

You are trying to cast spells, but unfortunately you can't see your own spells only those of your opponents (think Hanabi). Additionally some spells are hidden so your information is always incomplete. You must deduce, take risks, and hope for the best. The game is very good at creating fun moments as players hedge against the odds to cast that critical spell. Succeed or fail someone will be cheering the result! There are also some nice little tactical tricks and pitfalls to discover. 

It's a brilliant game!

Pros:

Fun casual game where you guess what numbered spell tile you have through process of elimination.

Cons:

Tiles flip over easily during "shuffling" which makes them harder to randomize, you'll constantly be craning your neck all around the table trying to get a good look at everyone's tiles, people who are better at math will dominate this game.

A fine deduction game, but a bit random. It's very risky to call low numbers, but very lucrative.

Fun and simple game, not heavy strategy but easy to pick up and engaging.  The deduction mechanic is well-done; not too much and not too little for what the game is intending.

A fun light deduction game of casting spells. Very accessible and engaging. The deduction part does remind Hanabi in some way but this game is not a co-op and everyone tries to kill off other wizards with their spells. And while doing that you also try not to cast a spell you dont have (If you quess wrong you will suffer a loss of one life yourself). You also win the round by casting all the spells you have in front of you, but this is usually more trickier to pull off. The player ellimination also ends the round, so there is no bad aspect about that since everyone will start next round at full health.

I got to play this at a local meetup and it was a bit boring to be honest.
The owner of this game likes this game more than Hanabi. I guess he isn't a co-op type of player.  I was yelling "yeeeeesh" when the game was over. Oh and I did win the game and I came from the last place and got to first place so there is a comeback mechanism for sure? XD

This is a game like Hanabi, where you can see everyone else's hand but not your own. The tile spread is 1 one, 2 twos, 3 threes, up to 8. On your turn you say a number of a tile you think you have, if you are right, you cast the spell and can then cast another of equal or higher number. You play until someone dies, and then people get points. 8 points wins.
I didn't like it much, as there's a strange rule where the person who gets killed goes first, which is a big disadvantage, as you can't use healing spells, since you start at max, and you don't get the benefit of what other people try to cast, as it gives you information about what you might have, since people won't cast something they see all or most of the copies of in other player's hands.
it's a cute idea although it definitely outstayed it's welcome. Additionally the tiles aren't really tiles so much as cardboard tokens slid into these large plastic encasements, which helps to make it so you can't see what you have from above or to the sides, but it also makes it somewhat hard to see what the people to the left or right of you have without leaning into the table some.

RATING: 5
A competitive hanabi style hand management game about slinging spells at your friends? Sounds like a recipe for success, however, luck of the draw is way too big a factor. Your starting hand is a good indicator of how well you will do that round. Drawing a lot of 8s is the most common downfall, since they are the most common number in the game. Sure, they will help you survive a round, but surviving is worth a measly one point. Many rounds end soon after a player discovers they have the Dragon, which is likely to eliminate a player and score 3 points.

The worst part of the game, however, is there is no incentive to keep casting spells unless you are the lucky one who can eliminate a player or you are able to cast every single spell and end the round, because casting spells gives every other player information, but you are still playing blind as ever. Better to let everyone else do the dirty work and pray you have a neighbor with low health if you are lucky enough to get another turn that round.

You have to summon spells but you don't know which of them are available for you. That's the game's point and it works quite well especially with children who can memorize better than adults. Funny and short game with great components. A mixture of press-your-luck and combining information.

A somewhat deductive "Take that" game, with the simplicity of Love letter mixed with the reversed hand mechanism of Hanabi. I love both of those games and this means I won't own either of them. Great, light hearted fun.

RATING: 5
Enjoyable game where you cannot see your hand but sees everyone else's hand (a la Hanabi). Each turn you must cast a spell from your hand. If you have the spell card in your hand, you have successfully casted that spell and something occurs (e.g., player to the right loses 1 HP). Otherwise you lose 1 HP (except for Ancient Dragon). Overall enjoyable but I'd rather play Hanabi if I was in a mood for this type of game.

RATING: 6
Played twice. In Abraca...what?, players deduce the spells likely in front of them by looking at their opponents' spells and observing the guesses they are making. There is a window for a little misdirection as you could purposely guess wrongly to throw your opponents off from realising they have the sole Ancient Dragon in front of them. (Admittedly, this isn't an efficient move.)

Despite the clever base concept, the overly vanilla spell effects prevent the game from being terrific. There is also a slight balance issue with spell number 4 (the Night Singer) as it gives you additional exclusive information [i]and[/i] potential bonus VP. It is still good for a lark if you want a family-friendly game though.

RATING: 6
I am surprised that I really don't care for the components of this one. They're nice durable tiles but feel really cheap to me due to the weight. As far as the game goes... I like the Hanabi-like mechanic in which you can't see your own tiles but the deduction element is fairly low, despite what one might think. If you like a light game that boils down more to guessing than anything else, you could do a lot worse.

What a cute game! I greatly enjoyed immersing myself as a spell caster. I'm glad that it's a competitive game because that removes the potential desires to cheat that I dislike about similar games such as Hanabi and other hidden information games that are fully cooperative. I need a few more plays to decide whether to keep it long term or not but for now I'm happy to have it.

The idea reminds me of Hanabi, where only the other players can see each other's cards, but not their own. Seemed like a fun idea, but in practice it was quite a pain. 

The first sign of trouble was the constant need to see everyone's cubes without seeing your own. This meant a lot of acrobatics of peering left and right during your turn, all the while trying not to catch an accidental glimpse of your own cubes. Maybe this would work better, if everyone sat around a round table or on each side of a square table, but if you sit at a long table with people on just two sides of a table (like we did), then forget it.

The second sign of trouble was that once you try to plan in advance to work out which spells you probably need to cast during your turn, you will probably have forgotten by the time it is actually your turn and have to start figuring everything out from scratch. I felt the need to write things down, but as the rules neither mention that, nor provide any other helpful mechanics to keep score of what you need to do, I didn't bother.

The third sign of trouble was that a few players were eliminated before they even had a chance to take their first turn. With one player casting a massive spell around the table, then a few more small spells left and right, some players were dead without ever doing a thing. Maybe that is a rare occurrence, but it certainly left a bit of a sour taste. 

All in all, probably a fun and light family game if you have to right sort of table for it, but certainly not a keeper for me.

A silly game of trying to guess what spells are in front of you. Cute and fun. Hard to see the pieces; we had to keep rotating our tiles to face the active player. Possible to be stuck in a position where you can't do anything except cause someone else to win.

RATING: N/A
Took a good look at this game at Essen 2014, but instead of the spellflinging surprising goodness I'd been hoping for, it turned out to be a tedious deduction 'chance calculation' game with spells that all do amazing things as '+1 life' '-1 life' '1 point of damage to left' '1 point of damage to right' and more such creative goodness.

Pass. 

The idea of unknown spells is very good though, so if a designer would be able to create some tactic boardgame with it I'd jump on it in a heartbeat (4 wizard 'grad-school' dudes mixup their spellbooks and get into a fight because of it maybe? Powerful enough to know/do some crazy stuff, not wise enough to simply refrain themselves?)...

RATING: 5.5
I had high hopes for this, but it turns out that Hanabi without the clever giving and managing of clues descends into fairly random guesswork (and a lot of counting). The spells didn't seem to be particularly interesting either which was a shame.

Also, I think that the '4' spell might be massively overpowered, but from 1 play I don't have anything conclusive.

Ever forgotten which spells you know but tried to cast them anyway? Yep, happens to me all the time.

This game is a gem. My group can't stand Hanabi but LOVES when Abracada...what? comes out. I think that taking the core mechanic and twisting it for a competitive game was brilliant. Rounds are quick, the theme is quirky, and gambling on the dragon is fun no matter the outcome. Wish this game got more love. (10-20-17)

This is game not really a deduction game in the vein of Sleuth or even Clue. There is a significant push your luck element here that makes the game more chaotic, but also takes itself less seriously. Unlike a pure deduction game, the early rounds in each game depends more on luck. However, as more tiles are revealed, the deduction aspect becomes a bit more important. Being able to hear what others call out can also be somewhat helpful, though this information probably needs to be recorded somewhere. So, paying attention can be important.  In the end, this game is a bit too light on the deduction aspect, but is charming in its own way for a late evening filler.

Very similar to Hanabi, but with a little more meat attached. In doing so, it kind of loses some of the simplicity and elegeance that made Hanabi so great.

Winning is totally based on your luck. They say you need to deduct to proceed the game, but I don't think so. Yes, putting magic spells is a charming point. I agree with it but that's it. This is just a fourty-minute party game. Again, that's it. I am pretty much relieved that I got this game by winning the prize at some event, not by spending my money.

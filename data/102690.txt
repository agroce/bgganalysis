This game gets played nearly every gaming session. Some nights we play this exclusively because we are having so much fun. There are times when luck seems to be against you, and during those times the game can be frustrating. However, this only happens rarely usually by the end of the next game, all previous frustrations have been forgotten.

It's a game.  It plays fast 20 min.  I wish I could do something with all the cards in my hand.  You basically add 2 but play one around.  It would be nice to leverage doing something with your extra cards vs holding on to them to see how much they may help u later

A game that easily falls in the Munchkin side of the train tracks. While it should be a mortal enemy of mine, I found it pleasant to play in spite of it being luck driven and filled with dull scoring. Likely something to do with the retro fantasy artwork.

RATING: 3
A shallow tableau builder without any particularly clever mechanics. Villagers & Villains feels a bit like Citadels with the iconic role-selection replaced by a public dice-based draft of "building" cards. On the other hand, it's not a painful game to play, just dull.

A nice surprise. Quick, fun, light. One of the best lightweight card games - accomodates up to 5 players and is equally fun with 2. Worth a try.

I enjoyed this game but I am not sure what it is missing. The rules were a jumbled mess. Gameplay was kind of interesting.

A lovely little card game. Light and simple to get into. If you've played any games before you'll skip the basic game. A good filler game and also a good way to introduce non gamers into card based games.

A fun game with a surprising amount of strategy.  I've found many different ways to win (and lose!).  Highly recommended.

A fun drafting/dice rolling game. The game takes a little too long for a game of this type. If games are shorter with repeated plays, this will see lots of plays.

A game with a nice theme and fun art that falls short on heavy luck based mechanics. Every stage of the game depends on die rolling and/or card drawing.

Pretty typical "build your board" kind of game with dice rolling thrown in. Nothing new to see. Also, it makes no sense that monsters attacking your village count as part of your village.

This is an example of the kind of games that I don't like.  It is entirely luck driven, the decisions are obvious, the outcome is determined by a roll of the die.  The game plays itself.  It reminds me of another game I don't like, Machi Koro, but it's even less interesting.  The game can be taught in 2-3 minutes, and after 2-3 minutes of play there is only mindless repetition.

Great little game.  I have introduced this game to a number of people casually interested in games and they have all enjoyed it.  Its not my favorite game but high on my list of go-tos simply because of its accessibility and relatively quick play time.

RATING: 7
I don't know why I like this game! It plays a little too long for a game of its depth and it's a little too susceptible to random elements (card draws, dice rolls); there's also a "rich get richer" effect. Nevertheless, it's a fun game that I'd always play if asked and not infrequently suggest myself - especially for 5 players.

I have the expansions [gameid=155178] and [gameid=172886] (I Kickstartered them) and while I haven't got "Cities" to the table yet, I consider "Borderlands" to be an invaluable expansion to the base game.

Good light fun for an hour.

I like this game quite a lot but DH and DS don't care for it so I rarely get to play.

RATING: 8
Quite surprised by this little game. Can be setup quickly and easily learnt by kids (5+) and adults alike as the rules are simple and the turn-sequence documented on cards (1 per player). There seems to be a slight "bug" in that unless you get out a card that earns gold very early on, you can potentially become over-run by villains you can't get rid of.

It feels and plays like a Steve Jackson game that focused on gameplay before humor. Nothing too heavy, but it plays simply and quickly, with just enough room to laugh at the consequences of poor die rolls. Recommended.

It's pretty much a luck-fest, but at least it's of an appropriate length and theme for that. You shoot for something you like in the draft, roll the die, and you get it if your roll equals or exceeds the card's position in the draft. Otherwise, you get the first card in the draft. That's luck-fest part 1. If you choose/get a monster, roll a die to see if you defeat it and get its reward, otherwise take a penalty. You want to collect cards that increase your income (surprise), give you VPs, or generate VPs via combos or monster kills. It's one of those games where you get what you get and don't get upset. It's a harmless enough way to pass the time if time needs passing, without pressing too much of a replay case however.

RATING: 8
A mechanically simple and quick playing tableau-builder that has some deeper strategy than I suspect most people realize. The strategy comes from the variety of ways that you can win the game. Yes, there is a considerable amount of randomness but good strategy will usually beat blind luck in this game. If not, since you can play it to completion in 30-45 minutes, just play it again. An underrated game, in my opinion.

Really light, but very entertaining. Most definitely a good game to play when filling time. It might wear off if you over play it, other than that a fine game.

I really liked the sound of this one, but when I actually came to play it found it's not quite as fun as I'd like. 

The two player game seems to suffer from a bad case of the 'win more' problem - the loser lacks the ability to escape his situation, whilst the winner is then free to proceed unimpeded to victory. 

Desire to part with: I'd practically give this away.

I am not much for  playing games that have lots of ways to derail other players. V+V is positive, but with plenty of motivation to have the best village possible and win the game. Strategy counts as much as luck, and the art draws me in. A well-composed game in my eyes.

Be prepared for major randomness, but this light-hearted, easy to learn, simple to play title is quick and great for kids and would probably be a nice game night opener/closer.

I vaguely recall reading about this in Counter magazine where it seemed interesting, if flawed.

I think that's probably mostly accurate. The non-advanced game is barely worth playing, but with the advanced rules thrown in there's a bit more interaction and certainly more to think about.

Far from great, but this deserves another play or so to see if it's worth keeping.

After 2 plays we're loving this. Makes for a very nice, non-confrontational couples game; build up your village with no 'take that' interference from the other player.

Lots of cards, all with different art work - nice touch.

Ritka, érdekes filler. Egy kis gyors tablóépítés, minimális kockadobálás és nulla interakció a játékosok között - mégis vmiért élvezetes volt a vele töltött 20 perc. Keresni nem fogom, de nem utasítom vissza vele a játékot.

Hoplomachus is a series of three games (as of this writing): The Lost Cities, Rise of Rome, and Origins. Hoplomachus: TLC and RoR feel complete once you get both boxes, the chip add-ons and the extra play mat. Origins, on the other hand, feels complete as-is and comes at a much reduced price tag. The game itself appears to be a distillation of many aspects from the previous Hoplomachus games, and it provides a lot of game its price. The solo challenges are variable, fun, and of increasing challenge. The multiplayer campaign mode keeps things interesting as you progress.  

Origins is the game one should get to introduce themselves to the Hoplomachus series. It's a bit odd, though, as I doubt I'd enjoy Origins as much as I do if I didn't already have TLC and RoR. In the end, the entirety of Hoplomachus is somewhere around an 8 for me, and Origins will get the somewhat arbitrary benefit of my highest ranking.

The most glaring negative I have with the game is the rule book. It lacks some necessary clarity, which could be criticism of most rule books for the Hoplomachus series.

After falling in love with Too Many Bones, I acquired this which promised to be a faster to play tactical romp. Sadly, although the components are of course top notch, I found the solo trials to be both extremely easy and very repetitive.  The drafting restrictions did little to interfere with my strategy and replaying the same map with a slightly more challenging lineup was just repetitive since I could handily beat it with the same approach. There don't seem to be any community variants to spice it up and I don't see any compelling reason to play it over TMB.

Third iteration of the Hoplomachus system and functions as a stand alone game. Origins is an excellent entry product into Hoplomachus, despite being its third title. This version will also appeal to veterans of the series; as the game play on three smaller arena mats, each featuring different objectives, provides a gaming experience and challenge not found in the previous sets. Solo play is also strong.

Origins also provides a more substantial experience than Training Grounds, which the website indicates is being phased out anyways.

Played through the first three solo trials and won.  Seems pretty easy so far but I'm sure the difficulty will ramp.  Love the feel of the chips. It's a solid design but need to play it several more times to see if it has staying power.

It is all about the solo challenge & kind of drive to go through the trials. Of course adding additional chips is an added bonus, increasing variability in to the 2 main games.

RATING: 9
The only thing holding me back from rating this a 10 is the clarity of the rules and descriptions of actions and abilities.

If I keep loving the game maybe I'll work on some kind of FAQ or compiled rules.  I spend a lot of time flipping back and forth and sometimes have to waste brainpower trying to figure out what something means - even if it eventually makes sense.

But so so fun!

Limited unit variety and some options feel obviously stronger than others, but despite that the varied objectives in the three arenas are a lot of fun.
The solo challenges are also quite tough and provide an engaging alternate style of play.

RATING: 8
What they say about production quality is true. The chips have a really nice weight and feel and there is something to said with stacking them up and moving them around on the mats. The system is really quite neat in how simple it is and expandable. Hoping they maintain this form factor and introduce other factions.

I have not played many solo games (Cruel Necessity being one I liked very much), but I find this to be very fun solo.  I am amazed by how much drama can be found in some chips and dice.  The AI is very enjoyable to play against.  Recently had the Champion of the AI throw my gladiator overhead only to have the AI's gladiator toss mine to still another hex where he he was soundly defeated - quite fun!

Got to play at GenCon 2016.  What an absolute blast and super easy to learn!  The components are top notch, with the unit chips and with the health chips underneath for an easy visual of how healthy you units are.  I ended up going for the big beefy units while my opponent went for quicker units... and I got absolutely thrashed!  But it was loads of fun!  Highly recommended!

Rating based on 2 players.

Really enjoy this one. It's a bit chess-like in how each unit has different abilities and placement is key, but with the fun of dice-rolling (and is quite a lot less on the cerebral side!) While the graphic design could be better in some areas, the components are very nice and the chip stack is a really visceral way to show health.

I thought I would really like a quicker, simpler version of Hoplomachus for solitaire play, but this failed to grab me.  I will play it one more time at some point just to get it on the five and dime, but then it will go onto the sell pile.

SOLD, October 2017 (FalCon)

Never made that 5th session; I just couldn't ever muster the enthusiasm, particularly not with so many other more enjoyable solo options on my shelf.  Glad it found a good home.

Hoplomachus: Origins is a good introduction to Hoplo and sort of a version that I plan to use to teach others and get them interested in playing the previous two bigger and more complex games in the Cycle. I found that mixing things in from TLC and RoR made the Solo Trials super easy, so I plan to only use the Origin units from now on. This is a smaller box so it is more portable. And I foresee having a blast in PvP with quick games that are super fun and tactile. Well worth the money if you have it.

Very enjoyable!
Quick set up and excellent play!

A good mix of tactics and luck in the solo game.
Dice rolls have a big influence but because AI actions are also tied to them, it evens out the odds substantially.
The format of the challenges and gradual difficulty increase means there is plenty of variety with a minimum of components.
And every champion is useful ... sometime. :D

Excellent components. Gameplay is fast and simple, I love the theme and the idea of the game... but it's just random. There's no real strategy or tactical decisions to make. All that matters is the dice roll. You either roll hits or you don't, and whoever rolls better is going to win. Too bad. This really could have been something special.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
One of the biggest disappointments of my gaming life.  Love the theme and the idea, but the implementation turned out to be an abstract game and just about 100% at that.  Also not a big fan of the mats.  Great chips, wish I liked it.

Ordered it because of the progressive solo trials. There aren't that many tactical skirmish games with hex maps out there that come with solo variants. First plays show a fun and fast tactical arena game with quite interesting play and an astonishingly good AI for such a simple system. The solo trials - at least the early ones - look more like a puzzle on what choices in units gives you the highest chances for success. Essentially you are out to break the game with each trial. Time will tell what this does to replayability.

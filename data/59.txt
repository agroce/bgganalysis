This is a very good game that has somehow existed under the radar of many gamers. There are difficult but fun choices to be made in several areas of this game. It has a nice combination of luck and strategy that makes it feel more like an American game than a Euro. And of course, it's flat out gorgeous. Best game about the oil business that I've played. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Some interesting choices, most important of which would be how much to risk on being able to sell oil. Includes a press your luck element in searching for said oil... which is thematic. Not bad, not great... but that doesn't stop this title from hitting the table from time to time.

A solid "guess the best" kind of game with some solid strategy built in.  I wish they had come up with a better "oil supply" marker as the ones I have don't seem to fit together very well.  It makes the game a bit more fiddly than it really needs to be.  (For instance, black mini poker chips would have worked so much better...)

RATING: 6.5
Played once, and had a fun time.  Yeah, it's not the greatest game, but the systems are neat, and, damn, those bits are just plain cool.  Now, having said that... I fear that I might tire of this after a few more plays, and I think it's because there actually isn't as much player interaction as you think.  Other than the auctions, there's not a lot you can do strategically to "hit" someone (like the leader) other than get lucky with your wells, your certificate draws, and your "action" card choices.  And even then, you're mostly playing to better yourself, not maneuver around others.  Even the auctions can pale if players can't keep others honest.  We had some crazy good/bad luck in the certificate drawing and might trying making the deck 2's/3's instead of 1's/2's.  Mind you, I'm still itchin' to play it again :) [after a few more plays] Lowered my initial 7 rating.  As I'd feared, the game has become a bit "mechanical" strategy-wise... but it's still okay, and I've yet to tire of those cool bits.  Also, I'm now not worried at all about the luck of the dividend cards.

Nice components and good strategic elements combine in this game to produce a slick economic game.  The card selection mechanism with variable actions provides nice randomization without imparting a chaotic feel.  A game that flew under the radar and has been unfortunately missed by many.

RATING: 6
The game is enjoyable, but unfortunately it is heavily in favor of the first player.  The game is far too unbalanced.  The last player gets hosed so badly, I would feel guilty making that player play.

The mechanics are interesting and novel, and the game play is compelling.  If there was some way to fix the last player problem, it would actually be worth playing.  Well, you'd also need a different distribution of oil spots, playing on the corner furthest from the train tracks has a clear advantage.

A suggestion for a partial fix is to use the turn ordering from To court the king.

This is my ultimate game. It takes awhile to play, but time passes quickly since there is no down time. Each players turn involves many actions on your part. There's benefit to being first, and benefit to being last. A strong lead can easily be broken when a players engine is dragged back by another player. It's usually a surprise at games end to know who won... rarely is there a run away winner. This game was published in Germany and is now out of print. It's rare to find one for sale, but if you have the chance, it's well worth your investment. After several years of gaming, I finally rated my first "10."

I didn't think I would like this game because of the theme (oil drilling), but I was pleasantly surprised with this game.  The bidding to sell oil is especially fun and so is deciding which action card to take-- the one with many movement points, the one with lots of licenses, or the one with the "special action".  Searching for oil is even fun! Who would have thought drilling for oil could be so entertaining!!!

Played this one for the first time at the boardgame club August 2004.  As there were a lot of rules, we were adviced to start playing the first round whilst reading the rules.  This was the best way  to start as newcommer with the game indeed.  After all the game is not that difficult, it is just the number of rules that might overwhelm you at first.  It was a nice concept and we had much fun playing it !

RATING: 7
Enjoyable economic game.    Good mix of luck & strategy.  Too bad it only holds 3-4 players.  Beware of players that make mega-bucks in the mid-game, they can be tough to catch; also, at the auction phase, don't spend a ton of contracts to get paid high prices for a few barrels (ex. at the beginning of the game) unless you *really* need cash.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lovely bits (which probably brings the rating up from a 4), bit long for the depth of game play. I'm not sure how much decision making there really is - mostly you just take the best card left and move to the nearest well, and put your oil in the best market - all fairly obvious.

I suspect it would get old quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I would like to play this again. It was exciting to get to the oil tokens and not know if you would get a 2 or a 5 for your money (gamble), it was tough to choose between the 'move everyone back' card and heavy license (bid token) cards and the board movement makes sense with the theme. I liked the choice between moving your train (shipping component) and moving your truck (prospecting component). That ended up making a $ difference to a few. It did drag just a tad toward the end and I am unsure why. The game is certainly not boring as some have suggested. Cool bits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cool bits, interesting gameplay.  Bit of juggling between advancing your production and building bidding cards.  A little disappointed there's no viable "stay behind" strategy, with the capability of pulling trains back.  I don't like the intentionally overbidding mechanic, seems too much risk for little reward.  Ultimately I enjoyed it.

The game itself is not too bad the first time out or so, but the replay value tanks very fast. There is just not enough meat on the interesting bits to keep it going, and there is too much fiddly stuff. Good for a play or two, but preferably on someone else's copy. This game is pretty old now, it would be interesting to know if any of the people who rate this game a "10" are still playing.

Based on two plays, I think it's going to be an 7 for me.  The  different mechanisms mesh together tightly in this game. I don't see how you can do everything you feel you need to do, making the feel intense without great heaviness. The fact that you're bidding with contracts, not currency (VPs) for the right to sell, plus the legality of bluffing (lying) with risk of penalty if caught, makes the auction part of the game different than other auction games I've played. The only negative I have, which is not settled in my mind, is the game length. Maybe we played the black train movement wrong.

This game is... awesome. There is something fun about turning over an unseen tile and getting a 4, 5 or 6. It is also fun to watch an opponent turn one over and have a low number. This game has many ways to really mess with your opponents, during the auction phase or when getting to a well before someone else or by moving everyone's train back. I like not knowing when the game is going to end. I know some don't like the randomness, but I think that keeps it fresh.

Components: Great rubber towers, units of oil, and trucks. The money is as nice as paper money can be. The cards are entirely functional, though I think the movement color should have been green (for 'go') and the draw cards color red. The board and overall theme are depressing, a la Industrial Waste.

Experience: The thrill of the oil dig and deciding which card to take were the interesting parts of this game. The bidding was very straight forward, as were the decisions once I had taken a card. The game outlasted its welcome.

I quite enjoy the mechanics of this game. The mix of planning, bidding, and resource management seems to really work for me. I also have a very strange obsession with game board visuals and game piece industrial design. I know this may seem a bit shallow, but visual design grabs my attention here. Unfortunately two of my gaming group decided they hate this game purely based on the poor rules explanation I gave in our first attempt. It didn't help that one of the jArks decided to play to lose and managed to win. That only furthered his contempt for the game. The game now sits cursed on the shelves except for the rare occasion that those two members are not present at a given gaming session.

I bet that jArk would like it if he tried it again instead of being a potty pants. Kinda like Carcassonne.

RATING: 5
A long-ish middleweight game with pretty simple rules and some straightforward choices. There's some scarcity of selling opportunities and storage space, so you compete over these intensely. 
 
In our three-player trial, a couple of our auctions for selling oil had some overly wonky consequences [intended and uninteneded]. Similarly, auctions in Goa can break down with three, so it's not unique in this respect. Giganten is bordering on greatness, but I'd call this more of a flawed gem.

- random oil amount on tiles are ok
- random cards each turn are worse, it don't let You plan anything
- random prices are just ridiculous, completely different each turn (again take what You can, don't plan for future)
- random values on bidding cards also not helping (too huge differences, 1 or 2 is 100%)

+ nice idea of letting bid more than You have, but here it's unprofitable (when bidding around 20 You risk half of it to rise 2 or 4)
+ some other nice rules, but as a hole there are insignificant (like paying for transport)

Horrible, horrible play (only one so far). Luck factor killed my chances and killed all the fun. Dice against me, oil sources against me. The most important auctions I also lost by 1 or 2 points.

This is the original version by Kosmos.  Fantasy Flight has republished it. I am sure these two games will be combined here on BGG.

The great mechanics are the same.  The only differences lay in the number of players (Giganten/4; Black gold/5), and the components.  This game's components are superior to Black Gold.  The trucks are 3 times larger, the oil derricks are larger, and the oil builds up at the bottom of the derrick represented by large black squares that stack on the bottom and are easily handled.  The tiles revealing the size of the well are not as nice--coated card stock, not the heavy cardboard of Black Gold.  The board is a beautiful, large one-piece, 5-fold board.  

They are so similar that I don't need both, but which do I keep? Having the 5-player game is important. But the quality of Giganten is so superior. It's a dilemma.  Because I don't know which is better, they carry the same rating.

I like Giganten. It's light enough that you can play with family and non-gamer friends, not excessively long (and well timed for the game's depth). I like the commodity market mechanism and there are some interesting decisions each turn about where your resources are going to go. And the theme/mechanics balance is pretty well achieved. Still a euro, undoubtedly, but you do feel a little bit like you're prospecting for oil and playing the markets for profit.

Then you realize that the game is pretty processional, that the luck of the oil prospecting is almost Calvinistic in the way it determines the winner of the game, and then whatever actual "freewill" you have is mitigated by kingmaking in the sales/market end of the game.

Still, I'd play it again, which means the ride is enjoyable.

First time I played this, we played it wrong and the game dragged forever.  I don't even remember what rule we messed up on.  Now having played correctly, I can say this is a good game.  It's too bad there isn't an English edition of this.  It's not too heavy, it has a nice mix of mechanics, and it's very nicely produced.  Exploration, money management, and market driven auctions all blend well together in this one.

Speculation game, fairly well balanced.  No one is out of the race until the money is counted at the end.

Easy to learn, fairly quick to play.  Expect some tough decisions along the way!  The Production Certificates and bidding are quite important.

Players cannot be blocked, but you can slow them down.

Excellent mechanic of increased costs due to expanding infrastructure, but having a card which moves every other player's train backwards 3 to 5 spaces, regardless of cost.  Allows trailing players to catch up too.

Production quality is EXCELLENT!!

** 신선하다! 석유를 테마로 발굴 + 투자 + 경매의 요소를 
   잘 섞어내었다. 컴포넌트가 조금 질이 떨어지긴 하지만
   그런 점은 별로 문제가 되지 않는다.

   99 년도 게임임에도 불구하고 세련된 게임 시스템은
   지금도 충분히 통용된다.

   승리 조건이 돈 뿐이라는 게 약간 아쉬운 부분이긴 하지만,
   실제로 그 조건을 충족하는 방법이 생각보다 다양하다.

   특히 경쟁적으로 채굴(=시추)를 해야만 꼭 이길 수 있다
   라는 승리 공식 같은 것이 없으므로, 다양한 승리 방법을
   연구해 볼 수 있는 것이 이 게임의 장점.

   꽤 훌륭한 게임이다. 리메이크나 후속작이 나와줘도 좋을 
   것 같다.

If you look at the individual parts of the game, it's a little slow and slightly boring. But considering the sum of the parts, altogether it's interesting and some fun. Overall I like the game.

A fun little game with a good bit of luck (though, like Thebes, the luck seems thematic) that seems to last just a little too long.  I like the bidding portion, it can get pretty aggressive when the stakes are high.  I feel the same way about this game as I do about Auf Achse, maybe it's the plastic trucks.  I like it, but it isn't intriguing enough to become a regularly played game.  If it comes out, I'd be happy to play it.

My brothers and I loves to play games about oil on the computer (going back to the C64 and Amiga) and had great expectations of this game. I must say that we where NOT dissapointed. All the stuff we like is in this game: drilling for oil, market prices going up and down, auctions for selling and the twist about delivering crude oil by trains is excellent.

I'm mixed on the effect of moving trains backward and the randomness in which those cards can be drawn.  It effects gameplay hugely late in the game to pick up a card with that special effect.  Still, a very interesting game about drilling, transporting, and selling oil in an effort to earn the most money in the game.  Each turn is composed of 9 phases, most of which go by very quickly and are easily learned and played.

It's a solid filler game, not complicated and easy to learn. Played it for the first time and with 3 Players. I recommend to play it with 4 Players. The game should benefit from the expected increase in interaction and player-competition.

One of the few early Euro's with direct competition of the good old US hose your enemy variety.  Some subtle strategies also exist to stop your opponents.  Ultimately though, the game boils down to the choice to either not compete or compete in the auctions.  Getting set there is very painful.  I would not play with three as the dynamic of the three companies would break.  With 4, there is sort of enough competition, but ultimately too few auctions to make it hit the table that often when you consider how long you have to play the administrative aspects of the game to get to them.  In fact, once you are taken out, you may sit there for a long time to get your inevitable low result.

The board doesn't offer the same opportunities to everyone. There is a considerable advantage to the first and second player at the start. However, one can compensate a bad starting position with being smarter at the auction mechanism. Target the auctions you want to win for a high price, don't try to win all the auctions, but participate just to raise the price for others and step out just in time. I like that mechanism.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game.  The chance is present in many element of this one but it's going hand in hand with the theme : Oil Prospecting.

It must be said that ALL the chance elements are small on their own but together, if you're REALLY unlucky, it can kill your game.  

Personnaly, I liked it enough to want to play it more....the future will tell me if I like it tomorrow as much as today...

Interesting game where players drive around and discover oil, process it and then ship it to the markets.  There are three volatile markets the oil can be sold at.

The catch is that you're competing on the board for the oil, you need to use your valuable movement points to maintain your train (which allows you to ship if it's far enough along the track...), only one person can sell at each market for turn AND any oil supply, per player, over two that isn't sold at each market is dumped.  What I'm trying to say is that there's a lot of competition and the other players are constantly trying to overbid you, outrun you, move your train back or dump the markets you're invested in.

Mean game but a lot of fun!

Missing green truck

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The theme is great, the bits are great. The first phase each turn is moving your truck out in the exploration phase and turning over wells within your movement range and mining them. It can be cruel, as the difference between hitting the smallest wells and the largest wells is significant to your bottom dollar. You then move the oil back to one of the three storage companies, and each turn the right to sell off your oil at each storage company will be auctioned off ... and this can also be cruel. Your result in a latter auction can be hugely dependent on whether your main competitor wins or loses in previous auctions (keeping bidding money to bid you up or being short respectively). That's the crux of the game, but there's also a card choice at the start of each turn which sets your movement ability and gets you bid money, and the imbalance between the cards can be cruel as well. Hence it's an occasional play, enticed in by the theming, rather than a frequent play.

Interesting speculation game. While everyone else shot ahead to the more lucrative sites, I remained behind and cleaned up the lower half of the board.  I came in last in a game of 4, but part of that was a bad bluff & I got called out and lost half my cards as a result. Other part was I completely forgot the payout for the rigs at the end.  

In retro, I need to be focused forward with the group.

Based on one play: A very nice looking game, the pieces are great, but there is a wide mix of mechanics and the game seems a little unbalanced with a wide variety of scores at the end. Getting blocked on one auction can really hurt. The auction mechanic is odd, since you get a lot of cards, but the values are only one or two and you need to pile them up in order to ensure a win when you need it. Also, the train mechanic is odd, since your train needs to reach you oil rigs to ship oil, but if it is not, you need to simply pay $3K, so once you fall behind, you can just forget about the train as it is not worth all the extra movement points, which are limited. Nice to look at, but playing is not so great.

This is a drafting/auction game based on building oil wells and selling the resulting oil to oil companies.  You start by drafting cards that mostly give you some combination of movement points and drafting tokens.  Then you must drive around the grid board with your little truck token to find oil reserves and build wells.  Oil wells will provide you with oil for N turns, based on the number you flip.  You can place the oil you get in your turn in one of three markets (all with different prices that go up and down), but only the player who bids the most can actually sell at that market in the turn.  Overall, I found this to be a very compelling economic game with a unique theme and plenty of interesting decisions and interactions.

Superb game!  Why haven't more of you played this and why hasn't this been released in English?!?  Here's what you do: Drive your truck, search for oil, setup a oilrig, harvest the oil, put it on trains, store it in the bins, then sell it off!!  The mechanics works sooooo well together.  Very little downtime, wonderful fresh theme, beautiful bits, close & tense gameplay!!  Highly recommended.  My only beef is that it's a TAD too long and a TAD repetitive.

Outstanding looking game, the bits look great. A good mix of 3 different activities. 
Like the mechanics of selecting the card which has a trade off between movement and auction licenses. A movement/exploration phase is a balancing between finding a steady supply of oil which requires movement and money to purchase. The movement is also used move the train which helps gets the good to market. The licenses are used as a kind of money for a right to sell auction. There you can be committed and thereby bleed valuable resources.
The game is best with 4, ok with 3.

This is an average game as far as game play is concerned.  It's got amazing components with a number of different things going on like building oil wells, improving train systems, getting enough money and licenses, etc.

Despite all the goings on, it didn't seem like there was much depth to it.  But it does get bumped from a 5 to a 6 for the fact players are allowed to bid more licences then they actually have to drive up bidding.  Though there is a severe penalty if you get caught.

RATING: 3.5
I so much wanted to like this game. It has such a well implemented theme. So many things to like:

* Movement
* Exploration
* Commodity speculation
* Opportunity to bluff during auctions

It's an game in which each turn is divided into phases. That's good because it keeps the game moving at a decent pace. However, during each phase, the decisions presented to you aren't that interesting: either the choices are simply too restrictive or obvious, or the luck factor is so huge that making a decision depending on what could happen in the future is pointless.

Consequently, most of the decisions you make in this game are tactical in nature, not strategic. Combine this with the procedural, phase-driven nature of the game, you end up with something that feels very repetitive.

======

Simply put, though, the player who finds the most valuable oil deposits generally wins.

A mio avviso sottostimato. Forse perché è uscito in un periodo dove i giochi da tavolo non erano ancora così diffusi e forse perché è solo in lingua tedesca (anche se il gioco non è dipendente dalla lingua). Difficile vederlo in giro. Contiene diverse meccaniche di gioco apprezzate da molti giocatori, che poi si ritrovano magari sviluppate al meglio in titoli più famosi ma anche molto più recenti (comunque stiamo parlando di un gioco del 1999). Ha praticamente tutto quello che un gioco di successo dovrebbe avere: ambientazione ben ricreata, facile da imparare, non lunghissimo, bei componenti (i soldi sono addirittura stampati da entrambi i lati, cosa mai vista in nessun altro gioco), meccaniche collaudate e varie, giusta dose di interazione ed equilibrio... con un pizzico di fortuna legata al valore delle licenze (1 o 2) e dell'esplorazione dei giacimenti petroliferi… (trivellare in giro è decisamente appagante). Ho comprato il gioco dopo aver letto le varie recensioni che si leggevano in giro per il web e il gioco mi incuriosiva molto...  Se proprio devo trovargli un difetto, va giocato solo in quattro giocatori. A mio giudizio da avere nella propria ludoteca, ma... non si trova!

It is like playing 3 different games blended together in an interesting way.  At first I was concerned that this would not work, but every play mechanic makes sense and the theme is well served here!  Auctions are the most tense with 4 players, especially since you can bluff with your bidding cards hidden.  So many choices, everything looks good, but will work best this round?  Get some oil, transport it to storage, bid to sell it and you are on your way!  Just hope you plan for the current market prices!  This does not get played a lot as it is a 2 hour game, but since it feels like 3 games rolled together around oil and money, its time well spent!  Recomended!  :)

A Spiel des Jahres game from a time when the SpD games had a little more meat and substance to them.  And in the case of Giganten a little more nastiness where players have the ability to sabotage their competitors oil transport by moving their train backward, changing the price of their competitors oils sales (in lieu of pushing their own up) and taking them to the wall in the oil sale auctions.

A good bidding pseudo-economic medium-light game, remade by FFG as Black Gold. Black Gold allows now play with both 5 (recommended) and 2 (less so) players and provides randomized board in case you play often enough to introduce a pattern to your games, but is otherwise identical as far as I can say.  A good gateway game for economically inclined non-gamers (monopoly fans!)

Holy Cow, it took years for this game to finally make it to my table.  This was certainly one of my longest owned, unplayed games.  I'm glad that I never gave up on this.  

Sure this is an exploration game and there is going to be a lot of luck (and perhaps it is a little long for what it is), but that said I think it is a fun system.  The growth and upkeep mechanic is very clean and practical, and the market it fun.  I like the use of the two currencies.  Most of all I feel this captures the feel of digging for oil (not that I really know what that is like).  

Many tough little choices.

Very evocotive.

I liked this one a fair bit on my one outing.  I enjoyed the card drafting and the blind bidding.
----
This one is a solid little game.  Players have to make their plans to get to the various oil wells, and to sell their oil when the markets are in the right spots.  When I first considered getting this game, some users said it ran over-long, but I can only think that they mis-translated the rules because it falls in at nearly perfect length at 90 minutes or so, ~10 rounds (I think the culprit might have been that they may have been moving the black train, the game timer, back when they were moving other trains back).  I like how the game fits well with the theme -- all of the wells are random, and the two-derrick wells (the intermediates) are more "wildcat" because they could have 5 or 2 in them.

Although I do enjoy economic games, it seems that this one has an awful lot of luck in what wells you get (and I didn't get good wells the time I played).  It's not a bad game, but there are other economic games I'd much rather play.

RATING: 6
This is a game of drilling for oil and selling it at market. The board has fixed places where tokens are placed face down: they show a # of oil barrels. Each turn a new display of cards is placed; players take turns choosing one. The cards give variable #s of movement points, licenses, and possibly free oil. Movement points are used to either move your truck token or move your train forward (trains are parallel to general direction of board; being further forward is better for VP at end, and $$ during game). Cards may also allow you to hurt other players by moving their train backwards. If your truck is adjacent to a token, you can buy an oil rig there; it will produce that # of oil, 1 per turn. Each turn you place all oil produced into any of 3 markets, each with variable selling price (changes at the start of each turn, by die roll; cards may also allow you to affect price in one market). Then, 1 at a time, players bid for the right to sell in each market; bid using licenses. You may keep 2 oil/market between turns; excess sell for only $1000 each (vs. $3500-$8000 or so market prices). At game end, you get $ for oil rigs still on the board, based on train position (furthest ahead = $5K/rig, then decreasing value).

This is an OK game, with interesting auctions (need to bid on this market, or that one? did he use all his licenses up last time? can I get the market price to increase if I wait and sell here next turn:). There is also some luck of the draw (random token placement for oil production, random order for cards to come up). It is kind of fun, but I'd rather play McMulti, which has a similar theme (but better bits and more fun gameplay).

RATING: N/A
There are loads of things I don't like in this game. Some of the things are difficult to explain but they generally have to do with the feeling of playing the game: I simply didn't have any pleasure doing it. Nothing really happened that pleased me.

In a less abstract appreciation I didn't like the randomness of the digging (I know now that we played it wrong) but most of all what I really didn't like at all was the randomness of the licences and of the market. There are some controlling aspects of the market that can make players believe that they're really controlling it, sort of speaking, but they really aren't. If I struggle to sell something at a good price because I believe I should not risk too much and play safe, I may loose badly because someone can actually roll a good result and make my last sale look like the most stupid decision I've ever made. And it wasn't. I just didn't have enough luck. 

This shouldn't bug me that much if we're talking about a 45 minutes game but the outcome of such die result allied with my previous investment of licences makes me not wanting to play safe or risky for the rest of the game because it simply doesn't matter. I hate reducing everything to luck, which is not the case, but playing this IMO completely uncontrolled game that lasts over 90 minutes (it did!) it's not in my future expectations.

Eight years later, I have finally played this game for a second time.  What I said after the first time still applies:  "It was interesting to do, but with your success at collecting resources dependent on luck and then your success at selling them dependent on what comes down to a sort of all-or-nothing auction, the structure of the game is pretty suspect."  I've now scratched the itch to play the game again sometime and think once every eight years is about right.

Giganten feels like an auction filler with a board game built around it.  The best parts of Giganten (the auctions) are over so quickly that the rest of the game feels like a boatload of luck-driven tasks.  Each requires a trip around the table and creates few interesting decisions.  Draw a card from a face-up pool.  Move your car/train and inspect well sites.  Build one derrick.  Deliver oil.  Finally, enjoy the auctions. It's very long for the experience.

For a game that is so hard to track down reasonably, I think it is alright.  I traded an extra copy of Survive! for it, which worked out well on my end.  If I would have given an arm and a leg for it, I might have been disappointed.  Giganten does many things, and does them fairly well.  Players must manage several different types of currency, while still dealing with a very large dose of chance (for a Euro at least).  Amount of luck/chance is about equal to that in Shogun.  Can be long for what it is (though we played a variant meant to speed the game up).

If I would have played this game around the time it came out, I would certainly have enjoyed it better than I did now (2015). The game still looks great and is quite enjoyable, but I am a bit put off by the fact that it certainly takes 90 minutes to play with four, but victory is decided mainly by which cards come up in the last 15 minutes or so. Quite an anti climax, which I feel is handled better in most recent games. Also, given the fact that it only plays 3 or 4 players, I am afraid it will not see any more gameplay. Sold.

RATING: 6.5
The force of luck is strong with this one.  Not only can't you do anything about the value of the bidding cards you receive, nor could you influence the action cards that are revealed each round, and the market price of oil is determined by a die roll.  Then there are those pesky oil-rig tiles which are randomly distributed across the board.  So if you are really having a bad day, you just might find yourself paying the same amount for less returns each round.

I don't think Giganten play particularly well with 3.  It has that Age of Steam problem where one person is left alone while the other two fight over digging sites.  Not to mention that since there are three companies available for selling, potentially you could end up with each person controlling one market of his own, thereby eliminating player conflicts.  While that doesn't happen too often, as it is pretty unlikely all three will be fetching equal pricing, what will usually take place is someone will bow out of the auction early, thereby leaving the other to stop the third guy from profiting too much on his sale.  Personally I don't care for games that require self-sacrificing as a tactic to stop the leader from widening the gap, especially when there is little to be gained in return.

Quite disappointing to find out that the buzz around Giganten is more due to its rarity than how well it plays.  I'd be willing to try it again with 4, but I've been told it isn't too much better.

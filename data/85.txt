Very interesting wargame recreating the 1759 battle of Quebec.
The game manages to put faithfully both players in the shoes of the two generals.
Very tense and full of strategic options.

My only serious concern is the price.  Columbia charges $50 for a flimsy cardboard (unmounted!) map, 50 wooden blocks, 4 tiny wooden dice and a stickers sheet.  All this stuffed into something that has the size and sturdiness of a cereal box.
If you have the choice, go for the older versions.  They seem to be of a much better quality.

I rated the game based on the gameplay experience.

Operational block wargame with simultaneous movement.
So simple and ingenious at the same time.
The british player is faced with the same difficulties and constraints of general James Wolfe.
Taking Quebec is like a puzzle to solve before the St Lawrence river freezes.
A thrilling match for both sides.
A Classic! 

Can be played in 1 to 2 hours.

RATING: 8
Love it!  It's easy, challenging, historical, and plays fast. British have the quality units, and the French have the advantage of defenders rolling first and amphibious advantage.  By requiring the British to control Abraham and not take too many losses, it balances out the game.  The British have to feign attacks, just like they did in 1759.

First block game which I got. Very happy to find a solitaire way to play it. Love the optional rules you can add as well. Would be better f2f but still a good game all around. The only thing I would change is the board. Would prefer a more realistic map rather than hand drawn cartoonish map. But other than that this game is wonderful.

A gateway wargame for wargamers and eurogamers as well. Simple, simultaneous orders, simple battle system. Rolling amount of dice to score hits and win battle/skirmishes is a simple but effective way to play this war in less than an hour. 

Great replayability as blocks creates FOW. 

Used this game to teach newbies to wargaming.

Game with relatively simple rules, easily taught to newcomers and short play time: it's a light wargame. Winning requires a modicum of strategic thinking. Bluff is a big part of the game. Theme hits the spot for me. Gave away as a gift to my youngest brother, who had left Qu√©bec, "La Belle Province", some years ago back to France. I re-ordered this fine little game a few month later from www.columbiagames.com

Interesting game on a rather obscure topic.  Probably not the greatest simulation, but there are some interesting choices for both sides. This was a very early game for Columbia and the system bears little resemblence to the later games, so don't buy it just as an introduction.  But if you like a light, 60 minute game of low complexity, this will do.

It's hard to see how a methodical British player could lose.  Using weak forces to scout the French positions and then move over in force.

I think Levis is the key.  If the French don't garrison it strongly, the British will be able to split French troops on either side of Abraham.  Even though the Brits have to move their ships up and down the river, they can still go either way easier than the French, perhaps.

RATING: 9
I played this recently and it substantially exceeded expectations. Short, simple tense - I was really taken with it, and I'm not sure why I hadn't been before. I like the simultaneous orders, I think they work very well with minimal hassle, the bluffing and hidden information works as well here as in any Columbia game, the 16 turns makes for some time pressure, and the two sides play differently.

I'm not entirely sure of game balance (the British may be favored), and the game is mostly one of bluff and logistics rather than tactics, so it's unlikely to be infinitely replayable. But I really enjoyed playing it and for the complexity and playing time, felt that it was very, very good.

An ideal intro-to-blockgames for new wargamers. Quebec is simple, but has enough options to justify replaying. I LOVE the simultaneous move option, and it gets bonus points for being an extremely fast-playing wargame. Experienced players could get two games done in 2 or 3 hours, which is recommended since the sides are so asymmetric.

RATING: 7
Not sure which side it's more skewed to...I've read all the comments.  This has been my first block game, and I LOVE it.  Wargaming in 60 minutes?  Why isn't everyone doing this?  Bumped up to 8 after some really good recent plays.  Almost chess-like, in a really really good way.

10 plays. The game is solid. Tricky... Bit of a shell game at the beaches... Brits must mind the clock. Interesting puzzle of a game, with lively dice factor and a beautiful board.  And, it has the virtue of quick play.  Don't try to scale the cliffs from St. Charles under fire!  Played 4 times in a row and I wanted to play again. Takes about an hour to play. A keeper (as time, not me, has proved).  I dig it. Odd to think that my Quebecois ancestors must have been present during this campaign. Update... I think is a wonderful light wargame / starter wargame with effective Fog of War surprises, easy play, and some easy detailed chrome (such as the battle formations).

I enjoy playing this. The blocks with the decoys and the limited 16 turn game make for some cool tension. Its a nice length for playing a complete game in a short amount of time. 

I'm concerned that there may be one best strategy for the British and that the outcome of the game comes less from the tricky decision-making and more from the whims of the dice.

Still, I'd be willing to play this from time to time. Its definitely the simplest of the block games I've played, but it holds up fairly well and the theme is a fun one.

My first ever play of an historical war game!
More than 2 years later, Quebec 1759 finally hit the table for our second play.  We needed to go through the rules again, which took about 30 minutes with only a couple of references to BGG.  We openly discussed strategy throughout the game and afterward, with the result that we're both eager to try it again to attempt some of our ideas.

RATING: 6
Good simple intro to the Columbia block genre. I like the simple naval rules and the use of dummy blocks. However the situation is pretty simple and really only worth a couple of plays. There's two main routes to victory and it nearly always boils down to a final battle on the Plains of Abraham. At least that makes it historical. :-)

Even after 4 plays, it's hard to come to an opinion on this one. There are several strategic options, but they still feel rather limited due to the setup and small number of territories.

[gameid=1645] (weight 2.3) or [gameid=85] (weight 2.2) are perhaps the easiest of the Columbia block games, and most suitable for newbies (comparison thread [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/335943/war-of-1812-or-quebec-1759]here[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/405128/war-of-1812-or-quebec-1759]here[/url]).

British perhaps have a slight advantage.  NB: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/381741/quebec-1759-gets-an-overhaul-in-2009]revised rules and artwork[/url] in updated edition from 2009.

Great introductory block war games, with strong historical theme and flavour, elegance of gameplay, fog of war and bluffing, lots of fun, playable in an hour. Has an appeal and accessibility that many eurogamers will find within reach and worthwhile - a natural step up from games like Stratego, and yet offers so much more in terms of gameplay and theme.

I purchased Quebec 1759 because I am interested in the history of board games in general and this one is significant as being the first "block" wargame.  History aside, it is quick-playing, light but dice-heavy, wargame.  The theme is of high interest to me as a Canadian, and I don't mind having a couple of wargames with this level of ease.  I've always liked games where you have to intuit your opponent's next move, and secret unit movement handles this nicely.  The few "wargame-y" rules only serve to enhance the theme.  My rating reflects mostly the historical significance, theme, and ease of play vs. level of enjoyment.  If a game like Quebec 1759 came out today it probably wouldn't get much notice. But as the first block wargame, plus the fact that it is a great introductory or light wargame, great for 60 minutes, I think Quebec 1759 stands up well.  It's pretty dice-heavy, but I'd rather play a game like this based on something historical in 60 minutes than Risk, which has no history, no colour, and takes about 6 hours.

This is a fun game and considerably deeper than Stratego.  The only resemblance to Stratego is the fog of war.  Pieces don't cancel other pieces (ie bomb, mine sweeper, ...).  This is a completely different system.  LOTR The Confrontation is more like Stratego.

I'd rate this game a bit higher but it only has one scenario so there is limited play.  Definitely worth owning but it isn't worth the retail asking price.

A simple introduction to block games. It works reasonably well although there are only two strategies for the English (and limited tactics within these). Also, the French can really only react to what the English do, rather than take a more pro-active role.

The simultaneous turns spice things up at the cost of adding a "rock-paper-scissors" element.

After I decimated the English army as Wolfe made his way onto the Plains D'Abraham, I think I'm going to struggle to convince me lady to try the assault again.  Maybe she'd be happier on the defensive side, but of the few session reports I'd read, it seemed that the balance was slightly in the English's favour. A solid defense (and some lucky die rolls) kept her troops at bay and by the time she was making her big attack, it was really too late.  She said she'd give it another go.

bought it back. love the block games. such elegant designs with more depth than you would give them credit for at 1st glance. Quebec is the introductory game, but has all of the above. there is probably 20 plays worth of system exploration build into just 12 space on a map. quite a feat of design. it has been in print for 40 years, so is obviously still generating interest, as the perfect gateway into block wargaming.
Wolfe at Quebec is an amazing tale from British small war history also, I have stood on the battlefield. very cool.

RATING: 8
Although an old design, I think this is a very good game to use as an introductory wargame.  Games usually last no more than 1 to 1.5 hours.  The current version is let down by lacklustre graphics on the blocks themselves, but the map is portrayed in a "period" style and I find it very evocative.

This is a fantastic title. I have the first edition with the older block decals and love playing it. I intend to purchase the newer decals which are very well done. I think this is a great starter game for newer war gamers. Columbia Games make some of the best block games on the market.

RATING: 8
One of the originators of block wargames, and still a good one. Also one of the simplest, so I figured it was a good start to the concept. I really like the mechanic of writing orders; you are always second-guessing your opponent, and it puts you in the mindset of how war was conducted during the time period. The map is also styled like the time period, but unfortunately can be a bit confusing to figure out where everything is. The combat mechanics play well enough, and it's nice to have a game like this that can finish in under an hour.

The theme alone would make this a winner for me, but there is also a quite playable little wargame in there.  The fog of war effect provided by the blocks and simultaneous movement works well, and the small scope makes a game short enough that several are possible in the same sessions.  The main knock against the game is that its simplicity makes it also stale if played too often, but once in a while it is worth it.

1759 was my first war game. I've owned it for 15 years and I never get tired of playing it.  I've used this game to introduce many to block games.   I love the fact that you can play it twice in an evening.  The game also does a great job of illustrating the problems faced by both Wolfe and Montcalm.

I've played the latest version of the game, and I think that the original version which uses decoys rather than detachments is the better game.

One of the better intro block games.  The minimal number of units make it effectively a game of maneuver .  Generally, there a some small battles where the French are trying to bleed the British and there will be one really big battle, usually for Abraham.  The simu movement makes the game.

Fast and fun.  The written orders are a nice touch, even if the range of possible strategies is fairly limited.  The battleboard creates some interesting tactical opportunities and allows battles to end before the complete annihilation of one side or the other.

Played as a kriegspiel with 2 players on each side that could only communicate by text when the generals were apart (we added these as counters to the game).

RATING: 7
Simple and fun block game with hidden movement/simultaneous orders, deserves it classic status. Maybe a little on the lucky side, probably pretty much every game ends in the great Abraham dice fest. Really quick. Maybe a little lopsided to the French in a way that the English player needs to avoid small tactical errors more carefully, or fall under 20 unit steps quickly with a bit of bad luck.

The Canadian Wargamers Journal's "advanced variant", which is a modular set of little optional rules to adjust the balance to either side, is a must try.

RATING: 7
I like the theme but, it's really too simple. Not easy neither to change strategy between different sessions. It seems to me playing as the French that the best is to use the Indians for raids until the British succeds to land a big ground force somewhere. 
The good point in this game is the fog of war, it's really the best way to use it, with secret orders resolved by both sides at the same time.
It's probably the shortest wargame (in time) on the market. Set up and play takes one hour, no more.

Edit: I initialy gave a 5 for this game. Now, I rate it 7. There are more different strategies than I thought at first.

I gave it a seven for it is a strategic game, really easy to play, the block system works well. I find it easy for the British player to move to Levis and then gradually take Cap Rouge although maintaining the troop level at the required size (20cv's) is hard to do..... 

Fun game.....I have played it several times and the closest one has gotten is 18 CV's for the british....

I would rate this much the same as Avalon Hill Civil War or even Origins of of WWII....not difficult to pick up on, can play easily in 30-45 minutes. 

Th frustrating thing about this game is the dice roll...I have had a small french force descimate the british with real lucky rolls, thus the game is over almost from the beginning

Played with Garrett (12/26/09). I think I'd need to play this again to get a sense of the game's long-term appeal for me. It didn't rock my world on . I'm sure I'm missing the finer points of the strategy, but it felt like it comes down to who is rolling better dice. I did like the simultaneous movement and the cat-and-mouse element between the Brits and the French. The Indians were also a pretty cool unit. I'd give another go sometime...if anything to explore the various strategies of the river crossings.

11/27/10 Played once, using a set from 1985 (at least that was the copyright date in the rules). There isn't a single photo of this edition here on BGG.

It's main strength is how easy it is to get into and play. It's a simple, fun and quick wargame, not exactly a filler but not a main course, either. I have no idea whether it's good for lots of plays (I suspect not) or whether it's balanced. I think it might turn out that everything depends on the dice rolls on the Brits' first invasion. The decoys and opportunities for bluffing are a nice touch. LOW priority, because a friend owns it.

Elegant asymmetrical block war game.  The British win by conquering a region and holding it on Turn 16.  The French win by keeping the Brits from accomplishing that goal or if the Brits fall below 20 CV.  

It's a game of maneuver and bluff that's easy to learn, plays quickly and has some interesting ideas.  Frankly I was surprised this came out in 1972 it has aged very well.

A surprising title from Columbia Games. Compared to its heavier siblings, this game is a very light wargame. This game is the best, most straight example of block system FoG(fog of war). The bluffing and hidden intelligence works best here. A little bit of tactical decision(forming the columns) spices things up too.

There's a hell of a lot in this small package.  For me, one of its biggest assets is it's simplicity. 

Many approaches possible to this game. French need to use subterfuge, utilizing decoys effectively. Trying to minimize attrition of your militias through British occupation of the board. The Indian is very small force, but critical to your success if used effectively.

This was the first game I encountered with chunky wooden blocks representing troops (as opposed to 1cm cardboard chits). Blocks are rotated when they take damage, and their use facilitates a degree of 'fog of war' uncertainty over which of your opponent's troops are where. If that sounds familiar, it's because it has become a characteristic of all Columbia Games. Gamma Two later morphed into Columbia Games.

Being Canadian, I'm pleased as punch to own this game, and I picked it up for a very reasonable price -- when I really thought I was going to end up shelling out a lot of money for this one.  Thank God for the reprint!

So -- Q1759 is the recreation of the Brits kicking the French outta Quebec, and is the precursor to the British foothold for the War of 1812.

So far, I lose badly at this game.  But you know, it's fast, pleasant, and relatively easy to digest and play.  I also like the blind decision mechanic, and the simple rules.  I also have Columbia Games' 'Hammer of the Scots', and Q1759 is very similar, albeit much simpler, without cards, and much shorter.

I will enjoy having this game in my collection, but truth be told, I'm afraid to play it again and get spanked, again!  But hey, for a piece of 'Canadiana'/'Britannia', it works well.  An excellent acquisition for a proud Canuck like myself.

RATING: 10
O.K., I‚Äôm bumping this up to a 10.  My friend and I just played our 23rd game and it was one of the best games we ever played.  We stopped playing the game about 6 months ago because we developed an optimal French strategy that was just too tough for the British player to overcome.  I decided to give the game one more try to confirm our belief thinking that I would end up retiring the game.  Instead, we had an incredible contest.  I played the British and he played the French.  He adhered to the impenetrable French strategy, and I tried to soften him up with some territory gobbling tactics to erode his units.  We had a couple of early clashes allowing me to get a numerical superiority, and I was able to destroy his indian unit.  Then, he launched a surprise attack against a smaller force, which was surprising because he had to abandon his defensive position.  His idea was great because he inflicted a good amount of damage on me.  I was under time pressure to win because the British lose if they don‚Äôt take possession of Abraham by the end of move 16.  So, I had to launch my forces against Abraham on move 16.  I was numerically stronger and winning the battle with a route looking more and more likely.  Unfortunately for me, the British are required to keep a certain level of strength to win, and I fell below that threshold.  My opponent won by the narrowest of margins, but I was winning all along.  So, we both want a rematch.  The amazing thing is that we were able to play a war game on a Monday night, have an incredible contest, and finish in an hour.  

Initial Review:

I was looking for a simple war game  to try and found that it had good reviews on BGG.  I bought this game two months ago and played it 13 times already against the same opponent. My friend and I came away from every contest pleased with the game.  First we thought the British were j just too strong because the first 4 games were won by the British side.  Then the French had 3 wins in row.  Now it goes back and forth.  Sure there is a heavy dose of luck, but only one of our 13 games was decided by luck alone.  And maybe it wasn't luck--I played the British and was repulsed by the French and tried again and was again repulsed.  I should have stopped and looked for a different place to attack.

The game wasn't inexpensive, but with 13 plays already my $45 investment is nearing $3 per play.  I think there are a lot more plays ahead.

Simplest and quickest of the Columbia block games. The combat system isn't as good as the one in Hammer Of The Scots, but the game overall is fun and only takes about an hour. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really simple and plays fast but with a lot of tension throughout. Play might become somewhat stereotyped after a few games with the outcome being the matter of the results a few dice rolls out of a substantial number. Five plays with no French wins but down-to-the wire in two. (Played with 1973 ed & Rules) 

Update: Dropped to a 6 because it still works as an introductory game where you want the new player to have a very good chance to win (otherwise only a 5). Strongly favors the British (at least 3:1). The French have too many places to defend with too few troops and too little mobility. Cap Rouge is the real killer. With more-or-less average die rolls the ONLY French chance is to have a maximum CV 6-unit (as all 4 starting defensive areas need 6 units; barring minor sneakiness that'll probably just burn the French in the end) force in the one area the British choose to assault first. So AT BEST the French have a 25% chance to make a game of it.

Small little wargame. It's not the kind of game that you would get out of the closet very often but that need to be played regularly in order to understand the strategy of both side, witch can be very different if your playing the French or the English. There is a lot of luck involved like in most wargame. The game is unbalanced favorising the English side but this is taken into account in the victory conditions

Bon petit jeu qui ne sortira pas du placard tr√®s souvent mais qui devrait √™tre jou√© r√©guli√®rement afin de ma√Ætriser les strat√©gies de chaque camps. Celles-ci peuvent diff√©rer grandement selon que vous jouiez les Francais ou les Anglais. Il y a beaucoup de chance dans ce jeu comme dans la pluspart des jeux de guerre.
Les anglais sont avantag√©s dans ce jeu, mais les conditions de victoire prennent ce facteur en consid√©ration.

Excellent light and quick wargame! I'm biased because I've been to this area before.

Notable points: Very small map in terms of areas in which you may have troops. After a few games, I suppose, tactical options would become boring. However, because of the simplicity of the map geometry, you could focus on bluffing your opponent! Also, you get to roll *a lot* of dice!

A lot of fun on the first play... moves quickly but not as much variety as Columbia's other offerings... issuing orders to just one unit per turn makes strategy more challenging... combat doesn't end after three round like other block games, so don't be afraid to retreat when the odds are against you... love the Indian moves (skirmish or scout)... takes an hour or less, so this makes a great filler...

Tried it because of the Canadian angle but there doesn't seem to be enough going on in this game. The British must conquer a specific target within a certain number of turns to win, while the French need only kill off a percentage of the British forces to win. So it seemed the only thing for the French to do is lump all their forces on the target, use their Native ally's long-range ability to pick off some Brits as they approach, and then wage an all-out dicefest.  Since the British need 100% enemy casualties and the French much less, they are very heavy favourites to win.  I don't think I'll feel the need to play this one ever again.

This game is simple, graceful, and intersting to play. I enjoy the way naval movement is conducted and restricted by the British player. And I like the decoy troops to keep the opponent guessing. Overall excellent! My only (small) complaint to COLUMBIA is that the game is a little over-priced at approx. $40.00 retail. The board is small and it's not mounted and the rules are 8-page fold-bound. They may want to consider a 2-pc. box (instead of the 3 pc.) to bring it down to the standard $30.00-$35.00 range. TRANS-AMERICA, and CARCASSONE have wooden pcs. and they both retail around 20 BUCKS!??

My rating on this game goes up from a 6 to an 8 simply because I added the variants available from DEER VALLEY.  This allows me to play the game solitaire and WOW it works well!  I have the original version of the game from Gamma Two in the flat box rather than bookcase, and much prefer it over the newer version.  I like the "pips" to signify Combat Value rather than the numbers with the crossed muskets, etc.  I also own the newer version and am glad the beautiful map has stayed the same, as I have almost worn out my old mounted map.

Early block wargame, pretty simple rules and low unit count, only 12 map locations, playable in less than an hour, good intro block wargame.

Trade interest: high. Block wargame with a full colour board that plays in one hour. Blocks are replaced rather than rotated. Some players report balance / replay issues due to the two sides' different victory conditions. Not one of the better block games, apparently, but would be good trade fodder as an intro to blocks.

One of the smallest of the block games - perhaps too small.  Shares a lot with its only slightly less old brother, War of 1812, but to me it is not as satisfying as that game.  The situation is more constrained and the strategy less broad.  On the other hand, I like the simplified three-column battle system quite a bit.  On the whole a good game, if not a great one, and worth breaking out from time to time.

5+ plays. It's a good Columbia block game, as are they all.

It just didn't grab me the way others have. Maybe I just feel no affinity for this little slice of North American history, or maybe it just wasn't different enough from 1812 - which I had owned first.

It seemed to be quite simple for a war game.  It's probably a good tool to get players interesting in the Columbia Games block games, but there didn't seem to be much of a game there.  At least you can probably play it quicker than you can set up some of their other block games.

The limited scope of the historical situation, combined with the clever block system in its early stages of development, make this something unusual: an easy-to-learn, highly playable wargame that also succeeds brilliantly as a simulation. War of 1812 is comparable but perhaps has more replay value.

Three plays under my belt now and it seems like a very good intro to block wargames.  Quick play (about an hour including rules explanation) makes this very accessible.  The amount of bluff and tactics involved seems to indicate pretty good replayability.  I do believe that the British have an advantage, but that introduces a lot of tension into the mix, as the French have to bluff their way to a good start.

A fun 2-player war game on a map with 12 spaces, using blocks (including some blanks), hidden French setup, and written simultaneous moves, consisting of 1 order per side each turn (for up to 16 turns).

The very first "block" game, it has held up amazingly well.

It's a bit simple and abstract, but I've successfully played it with "light" gamers, who would never normally consider playing a war game.

"Real" war-gamers may sneer at it, but it's the closest thing I've ever seen to a "gateway" war game.

I own the original Gamma II Games edition.  There have been some rules changed over the years, some of which ("detachments" instead of blanks, leaders, Indian scouting) complicate the game for little effect, and one of which (removing the flanking rules and revised routing rules) is a horrible mistake, which makes putting units in the reserve mostly a waste of time.

If you can find an earlier edition, use those rules.  Sigh.

RATING: 8
As Quebec 1759 and War of 1812 are recognized as being two of the best introductory block games in existence, it seems natural to compare the two.

So let's put them side by side and see what shakes loose:

The simultaneous movement (which is optional in War of 1812) works much better on Quebec's smaller board, as it's always possible for the shoulder-to-shoulder French/British pieces to attack or slyly retreat.  Maneuvering the Americans/British in 1812, in contrast, frequently involves the marching and grouping of individual pieces, which can drag the game; the need to prepare for winter each year in 1812 just accentuates this unfortunate characteristic.

Combat in Quebec, with its three-column deployments, routing, dummy/detachment units, and reserves, can be a real nail-biter and is always fun. War of 1812 takes the least interesting part of Quebec's battle matrix - the all-in skirmish - and uses that as its entire system.  In both games, combat involves a LOT of die rolling and hoping for a 1-in-6 chance for a hit.

Since both Quebec and 1812 predate the A/B/C initiative system, combat in the two games strongly favors the defender in battles where the two sides are equal in number - although this situation seems somewhat more likely in 1812 than in Quebec.

Massive pitched battles can effectively end either game early, but this seems to be a greater possibility in Quebec.  Is this a bad thing?  I'm not sure.

Both games include rules that reflect interesting contextual details from their respective time periods, including American militia not wanting to cross into Canada in War of 1812 and troop losses/desertions from supply capture and British farm-burnings in Quebec 1759. 

Conclusion:

While War of 1812 and its greater number of map areas may ultimately have more replayability, Quebec 1759 is shorter and - due to its bluffing, outguessing, and decisive routs - more viscerally satisfying.

The two games are also different enough that owning a copy of each is acceptable, and even suggested - but keep in mind that both of these venerable "classics" are better viewed as family or peer bonding experiences rather than deep forays into block wargaming.  For an up-to-date introduction into modern block gaming, Julius Caesar and Richard III are your best bets.

[i]Update:[/i]

Having played Quebec 1759 a number of times, I'm convinced - as are others - that Columbia's decision to switch from decoys to 1-CV detachments in the updated version has inadvertently broken the game.  (For spoiler reasons, I won't say how; but internet research should reveal what's been broken, and why.)

Effective immediately, I'll be reverting back to the original rules in which detachments are dummy blocks that (a) can't be deployed in battle (they are removed from the game instead), and (b) can't be moved by themselves or left by themselves in a map zone.

I read the rules and it looks elegent.  Looks like a huge step up from Stratego.

EDIT:  I've played this solitaire and enjoyed it though it certainly isn't a great game for solitaire.  I hope I can talk the players in my group into playing this one.  The rule books is great particularly the historical information.  The map is a little bit confusing to me still.

I own the updated version of the stickers along with version 2.0 of the rules. It is worth noting that the French 2.0 version is different from the English one on several points (fire on retreat for ex.). I discarded the translation to stick with the English one.

Well, despite all the nice comments, either I am growing picky or I missed something. There seems that the players could save a lot of time by just throwing each side against the other without bothering with initial placement... More plays needed I guess.

On the other hand, with those simple mechanism, it is entirely advisable to a beginner that he plays it some times.

RANK: 21

RATING: N/A
Initial thoughts:
The good: production values are crazy high due to economies of scale. The minis are excellent, cards are solid, and the dice are etched. You're easily getting your money's worth. The timer during card drafting is a nice touch as was how damage is handled.

The bad: How re-playable is this actually given that you unlock and do scenarios? I guess with the random card draws it should be ok. Programming is ok, you eventually sort of get to do whatever you want late game which was sort of anticlimactic.

When my husband and I saw the Dice Tower review we were very excited. "What? RoboRally plus Zombicide plus Twin Tin Bots?!" We marked the date on the calendar when we could order it. When the day came the Riot Games Website could hardly handle the load. I had to sign up for an account so the process would be quicker and I could get through. I made it! When the game arrived and we opened the box, the components and packaging were like no others we had seen - every reveal of a layer inside the box was followed by oohs and aahs of total delight. And the game play even exceeded all of our expectations. Our fellow players said, "whee can I get this game?" An immediate rating of 10 in all respects. Yes. Buy it. It is more than worth every penny.

2017-06-11 (rating 7):

Rating after only 1 game with 4 players, first 2 scenarios.

Surprisingly good. I was expecting something average at best, especially once I learned this is a cooperation game, but ended up enjoying the game a lot. Most likely because I like the "programming" mechanic. And also the game is excellent in how it looks. (Although the box is impractically huge!)

I didn't think this would be my kind of game, but I found it really fun.  Rating based on the tutorial and first scenario.  Interested to keep playing the other scenarios, but a bit concerned that the gameplay gets repetitive.

Raised to a 9 after reading a review that says they do a good job of mixing up the scenarios.  Would really like to play through the game now!

RATING: 7
Everyone I played it with (casuals) loved it but I was pretty bored playing it because too light and coop so no excitement. There was potential strategy in planning your move but I never did to minimise the downtime for others and because it was never necessary since it was coop and the game is pretty easy. Most of my effort went in running the game then playing. Variation in missions is amazing and what keeps me going. Would have kept it because of its universal appeal to casuals but William wanted it so sold to him.

Fantastic card drafting game and programming game.  You draft cards, place them on your board, and then operate in accordance to where you place the card.  The game comes with over 100 minion miniatures, but there are few and far in between where I end up using more than half of them.  Great game, great theme, very linear, but very fun.

I LOVE THIS ONE!!!  If you like programmable movements, YOU MUST TRY THIS GAME!  Excellent production value (beyond excellent!), nice theme that works for both those who are familiar with League of Legends and those (like myself) who are neophytes.  It can plod a little early and late, but that mid-game development is where it's at.  A great game!

Got further in the game to the point where the boss came out finally (played mission 1 a lot as I kept playing with new players) and bumped the game from 9 to 10. I love everything about this game. The production is obviously stupidly good, and enough has been said about that. The gameplay is honestly more important to me.

Coming from a longtime huge fan of roborally, this is the game I have wanted since I first played that game.  The programming carrying over turn to turn gives a good feel of progression. The mechs naturally evolve to fit a need in any given mission.  The chaos vs planning is just right for a coop game where it is much easier to laugh as a group when things go off the rails in a bad way than in a competitive game like robo rally. The chaos introduced by damage can all be mitigated by repairing or swapping the cards.  The Boss battles are incredibly fun, and feel different every time as the boss changes dramatically depending on which cards you program into it.

I am also very surprised how balanced the game is at least up through mission 3, many of the wins were accomplished when we were one turn from losing.

[Update]
Got to mission 8 of 10 (I think) and man this thing is just staying amazing.  We broke it out for one quick game and played to the wee hours.  Scale does not go to 11, but this is probably my favorite game right now.

Debated a long time with myself if this really deserves a 10 but the truth is that the more I play it the more I love it. Production is outstanding (even if the first printing has a few typos and mistakes here and there) but really the gameplay is so much fun. Having a blast with this right now, a solid 10 is the only rating I can give it really.

There may never be better production value. Consider it an 8.5 if you're the type to burn through all of a campaign/game in few sittings. Consider bringing a device with good speakers to the table for the Riot Games' website audioplays for each mission.

RATING: 8
Only a couple of scenarios deep into the game. But there is definitely more depth of gameplay than I was expecting after reading the rules. 

It removes the "Quarterback" problem of a co-op somewhat by making each player's control board too unique and chaotic for any other player to adequately tell them what to do. Only you know what you can do! We team up to smash our control boards together into something resembling a strategic plan. It's quite fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is a revelation, it's what can happen when a company with vast resources allows its passionate members to create something big and ambitious without constraint. The production quality is absurd(ly good), not to mention the game weighs like 18 pounds and it shipped for $5, so I have to believe this is basically just being done at or close to cost to get more exposure for Riot, if they are making money on this I am even more impressed. 

The game seems simple at first blush, and in some ways it is, its programmed movement with a draft to continually augment when your mech can do, but it has a pseudo campaign that unlocks different cards and stuff over time, and each scenario is fun and challenging and really just a goddamn blast. 

Also, the insert is the single greatest insert in the history of board gaming, seriously, it put any other stock insert to absolute shame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A few games in now. While having a common set of program cards to work with can make the game easier to teach, and the reality that players can specialize their role in game to game...it still feels like it is missing the character identity. The other end of the spectrum would be VAST, but I think that I would have liked this one to be closer to vast. Perhaps as i go through and unlock more it will get better, it just seems like the pace of releasing that specialization should have been faster after the "tutorial".

Gameplay wise, this is pretty fun. It's the first programming game that I think I'd enjoy replaying, and one of few games with real-time elements that I enjoy. It's also surprisingly good as a co-op - I tend to have a high bar for co-ops, and this clears that nicely. Components wise, as I'm sure, this is stellar. I'd probably say it's a 7.5 on gameplay, 10 on components, so I'm going with 8 for now.

The game is gorgeous. It's a fun coop that we enjoy quite a bit. However we've found it a little too easy so far (I've seen you can play again in hard mode, will need to try that). Also we're in the middle of the campaign and it's stalled for months now. The narrative is not very engaging. We would like to get it back to the table and finish it but somehow we always have other games we'd rather play (I guess that's not a great compliment for a campaign game...)

Awesome components and insert, probably the best I've ever seen. Gameplay is lots of fun but a little bit too luck dependant for my taste. We played easy mode for all of our plays and was still very challenging because you need the right cards showing up and no damage to vital parts of your programming or your mech might often end up shooting or turning in the wrong direction.

Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative tabletop campaign for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test.

Nagyon hasonlít a Roborallyhoz (nem árt ha valaki az irányokkal tisztában van), csak ezerszer igényesebb a kivitelezése, látszik a korkülönbség (mondjuk nehezebb is mint az elődje: 5+ kg!!). 1 küldetés alapján nem merek nagyon ítélkezni, állítólag messze ez a legkönnyebb a 10-ből, ami hihető is, mert simán megcsináltuk, nem is nagyon éreztem káoszosnak, inkább csak amolyan bemelegítő pályának szánták szerintem. Ez alapján letisztult, könnyed játék, de ki tudja mit rejt a másik 9 küldetés? Ez is ilyen titkolózós játék, ahol folyamatosan kell bontani a dolgokat, de azért ahogy néztem, nem az az egyszer játszós Legacy:)

Összességében nem rossz játék, de azért az meglep, hogy útban van a top10 felé, ezt elég erős hype-nak érzem, gyanítom hogy a tulajdonosok többsége nem volt képes a kincsére 9-10-nél kisebbet adni, és még nekem sem volt szívem 7 alá menni, ha a Robora adtam 6-ot.
Ja volt aki a Space alerthez hasonította, szerintem annál sokkal-sokkal könnyedebb (legalábbis itt az elején), és nincs az a stressz, ami ott:)

RATING: 9
Is it a deep thinker? Not really. Is it replayable? Unsure. Is it fun? Most definitely.

Despite the aggressive size of the box and the plethora of components, this is a game you can start playing within 10 minutes of opening the box. The production is simply superb. The quality and care is omnipresent from the components to the insert to the rule book(s) to the thematic flourishes and, honestly, to everything else . A couple of ambiguities pop up here and there, but none that bring the game to a standstill.  As a plus, it's the first game that my wife has asked to play on a weekday in I don't know how long. For that, it has to get a 9, even if I'd prefer we'd play more complex games.  

After our last session, I said that I wished this was the game that brought us back into board gaming instead of Pandemic Legacy.  

Do you want a polished, light, cooperative dungeon crawl-style game with a campaign? If so, get this. Do you want a more complex and strategic cooperative dungeon crawler with a campaign? If so, get Gloomhaven.

Huge commercial push throughout the internet to sell a boardgame version of the video game League of Legends. Theme looks very bland with robo droids blasting some plastic "minions". I can think of a million better Lore things to sell than a boardgame version of a video tower defense game.

Sam's #9 game of 2016. Corporative programming games
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A co-op that plays fast and furious. I love all the miniatures and obviously the overall production quality is outstanding. The legacy-esque style of missions with new scenarios and cards coming out as you complete missions is pretty fun and adds a lot to the sense of discovery. The main reason why this game doesn't get a higher rating from me is the core game is built around the "command line" which is a programming mechanic. It's fine but doesn't really tickle my brain the way I want it to as the game is pretty light. I normally am not the biggest fan of programming but this is co-op programming which is new and frankly, better. It still has that "you're not totally in control of your own actions" feel that prevents me from liking this game even more. Don't get me wrong, this game is fun but I'm perfectly fine not owning it.

Update (Feb 2017): 7.5 => 7
A minor downgrade just because the missions tend to feel "samey" with the only significant changes being the board setup and any new abilities the game introduces for the characters. Also while it hasn't yet gotten to this point, I seriously question the replayability of MvM once you've completed the missions. I can see user-created missions or additional missions from Riot coming out that might bring something new and fresh but otherwise I have to rate as-is.

One of the better cooperative games I have played. Tip: if the game seems too easy create a faster pace by quickly dealing cards after ending last round. Minimizing discussion about preferences between rounds creates chaos and a lot of laughter. Just accept the fact that anybody can make mistakes under pressure.

This is a a ton of miniatures on a tiny board and looks like a mess. The miniatures look great, but there can be so many on the board at any one time that it can be hard to figure out how the game makes sense. Apparently, there is a video game basis for this board game that I know nothing about so I apologize for whatever I am missing there. I'm just evaluating the game based on how it played with no understanding of the video game side of things. It feels pretty much like coop RoboRally and I'd like to play it again.

RATING: 8
Very, very fun game. In terms of production, this game is nearly unbeatable. All of the components are absolutely top quality, and everything has been thought of (for example the oil slicks on the map are a different, shinier material).

The game is a bit on the easy side, but that doesn't lower my enjoyment of it. Not every game needs to be 10/10 on difficulty or heaviness.

Not all of the scenarios are equally interesting and some of the missions are more replayable than others. However, all in all this is an incredibly enjoyable game, will certainly lead to laughs with friends, and has component quality that is nearly unrivaled.

If you told me that a video game designer was going to make a board game, i'd assume it to be mediocre at best. If you told me the components would be out of this world, i'd guess the gameplay was only okay, and that the cost would be well over $100. 

The TL;DR version is that this is a ridiculously well produced, fairly straight forward, incredibly fun game, that costs $75 with shipping. This was accomplished by only being sold by the publisher and not distributed to any retailers. Mechs vs minions is a cooperative program building scenario based game with beautiful minis and art, and a game system that is clever and unique enough that it has reviewers going "I don't normally like programming/coop/dudes on board/etc. but with this game it's great" This game is currently my 2nd favorite of all time, and my wife's favorite of all time. This is not just for the components, but the gameplay is incredibly solid and fun. Most games are close whether won or lost, and the various scenarios are all entertaining in their own right and I would gladly play any of them again. Also this is about 1 hour of play when you know how to play.

You may have to wait a bit for the next shipment but this game is worth it.

RATING: 7
Unexpectedly fun.
If you strip down all the great components, Mechs vs. Minions is just an optimization abstract: you have a small gridded board, a series of cards that impose some basic orthogonal movements and a few special effects you have to sequence in order to get the most benefits out of them. There’s little room left for theme here and all of that is taken up by the eye-candies, that is the outstanding miniatures and components, which double as what really makes the - otherwise dull - game.

Undoubtedly Mechs feels like Roborally somehow but only on a surface level: it gets almost rid of all the random effects and bad hands players have usually to take care of in the latter. Sure, damage cards try to duplicate that but they aren’t either that detrimental like a hand of move forwards with no turns nor as much annoying as a hand made of turns only, as they can be scrapped by just taking a sub-optimal card that magically repairs a damage, or by having yourself hauled by another player. Taking «permanent» damage feels just like an annoyance in the tuned optimization engine you’re building, not a tragedy you have to deal with in the less hurtful way.

Nonetheless, it’s fun: each turn you carve through hordes of the eponymous minions and lay waste in their ranks while showing off your perfectly timed combos.
Without all the bling, Mechs would be a dry puzzle-solving abstract: by adding a pinch of theme and the outstanding components it still feels like an abstract but somehow becomes more attractive. And a hell of fun too!

A programming game similar to Robo-Rally.  The difference is you draft the programming moves.  The cards are varied and it give the game flexibility.  I'm a fan of RR and I'm a fan of this.  The co-op part and the goal in scenario 1 was pretty cool.  It's very overproduced but that doesn't bother me.  Looking forward to playing some more.

This is an outstanding co-op experience. The fact that you cannot control all the stuff happening to your mechs makes the game immune to the alpha-player-syndrome and keeps everyone at the table involved. The game lost a bit of its appeal in later scenarios, but remains one of the best coop games I had a chance to play. Component quality anyone?!

This game is a lot of fun, the tutorial helps learn the basic rules and then the missions add complexity as you go. Cannot wait to continue playing soon. If you play I HIGHLY recommend that you open up the MvM website and have the group listen to the "radio play" as you go, it will immerse your group into the setting and it adds some fun entertainment.

I'm conflicted whether to give this one a 9 or a 10. It's very very good. Best game to play with kids over 10yrs old, for sure. In the end, I've docked a point due to some rules errors/ambiguities which detracted slightly. 

We're half way through the campaign and its been great fun. The game makes me want to giggle. The production quality is amazing from the huge box, lovely artwork, THICK cardboard, lovely miniatures to the cute "radioplay" soundtracks available online setting the scene.

Lovely plumage - not sold on the game play though. It's sort of a legacy game where you play then open the next bit and add some new stuff and play again, but you aren't permanently altering your game, so you could go back and do it all again. Not sure you'd want to though. It's definitely on the "solve a co op puzzle" end of things. I found it a bit dull, not sold on the draft, and the whole move the minions is a bit tedious. I think damage was the bit that killed it for me though. You're presented a puzzle to solve, a draft (with a timer) to get the bits you need and try to put them in the right order, and then damage just screws it all up (randomly, random damage hitting random slots) ugh - for a programme move game with chaos I much much prefer robot rally. I guess this is better at low player counts where you get more cards. Overall bit meh, no burning desire to play again, none to own

10x10 2017. Quite a good coop programming game.  Coop games can fall a little flat for me when they're to dry and puzzley.  This game avoids that with the frenetic programming.  You plan together but then you end up just having to do your best with the cards that come out.  The timer helps with this too.  Otherwise it would be possible for this game to be an AP nightmare.  As it is it's almost the opposite, trending a little more towards chaos.  The different mission provide a lot of variety.  Currently we're stuck at around the second to last mission.  And of course the production values are completely through the roof- it looks like it should cost twice as much as it does.

Hard game to rate. Rules are pretty simple, but the first two scenarios were challenging. Production value is through the roof. 

Much higher rating if played with kids. However, I am not sure about the replayability once you complete all the missions.

That said, we had a lot of fun playing this game. Right now, the main reason for not buying a copy is the humongous box it comes in.

I love this game!!! However, my main game partner has complained that it feels like you don't have enough control. I don't know if I agree, I haven't had that experience yet... but it can be quite the difficult puzzle to successfully program your mech over multiple turns. Overall, I've been thrilled with the tutorial and the first mission, but M̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶D̶a̶t̶a̶ ̶R̶e̶q̶u̶i̶r̶e̶d̶ for a final say.

EDIT: After another few missions I am just LOVING this game... but I can no longer find anyone to play it with. It's a combination of my one game group being pre-occupied with Pandemic Legacy, my other not wanting to play it because they feel it's "too light," my wife struggling with the programming, and the box just being too damn intimidating for newbies to jump into! I am faced with starting a new gaming group just to play this! Which I very well might do. Choked that I just can't seem to get more play time for it, but I'm still holding out hope for some rapid fire plays soon.

I love the idea of programming, but somehow Asteroyds and RoboRally didn't fit my taste.
MvM did. Maybe it's because of the Tower defense style, which I like. Maybe it's because of the Co-Op gameplay, which I like.
This game is great.

Not just because of Co-Op and Tower Defense and programming. There are several things that are quite impressive:
You learn the rules as you play
You can upgrade your programmed actions

I'm looking forward to open all those envelopes and this freaking box.

If you like RoboRally, this gives the same advanced planning feel with a different twist. 

Each round, you'll get one card to enter into your program, and that card will reactivate in every subsequent round. So, rather than clearing each round like in RoboRally, you slowly build your program here, with it repeating every round. You can also play on top of previously played cards, however, getting better weapons for playing over cards of the same suit.

The game is scenario based, with the goal generally being to fight a bunch of bad guys, or accomplish some task while fending off bad guys.

It goes without saying that this is the best produced game you will ever find for the money. Truly an amazing production that will never again be offered for this kind of price tag!

Production is over the top. Cooperative programming game with a dozen or so scenarios. I think this one plays better as a speed game. Too much time on the programming step leaves the puzzle quite easy to solve. Plus, as with games like Galaxy Truck, I think a significant appeal to this one is working with and/or suffering through the mishaps.

RATING: 7.1
This is smooth, simple, and enjoyable. The programming is fun and it has a really nice arc of gaining effectiveness as the game progresses, with your mech visually careening slightly out of control but wrecking tons of stuff.

I also love the psuedo-Legacy element of opening new scenarios with new goodies in each. A little slice of Christmas to chew on.

Of course, from a production standpoint it's unparalleled for the price. Probably the second highest produced game in my collection behind Kingdom Death: Monster.

Downsides are managing all of the minions movement and spawning can be tedious. The gameplay is also somewhat repetitive and the main spice is supplied via scenarios. Not sure if it will be all that thrilling when we run out of new ones to play.

Great production as everyone has said, and while the game works I'm not sure action programming and co-op go together because it's so hard to strategize on what you want to do as a team to actually complete the missions. We tried mission 1 twice and failed miserably both times, each time barely moving the bomb along the way to its goal. The biggest problem for me is the game is just fiddly as on each turn you kill minions, remove them from the board, move all remaining minions, then add more minions. Like Zombicide it just feels like work instead of fun to me and while I would play MvM over Zombicide because the theme is better I have no desire to own it.

Very fast-paced, easy to learn and fun game. You can play a mission in about an hour with setup included. The game and its components are beautiful. Even the inserts have their own details which is ridiculous. The amount of stuff in the box and the quality of these items are definitely worth at least 2 times the retail price of this game.  And the feeling of opening up new missions for the first time from the envelopes is just awesome. I recommend getting this game if you like programming mechanics. Also I'm sure kids would love it too.

It would be foolish to pass up such a low-priced high-quality production as this (obviosuly subsidised to a stupidly high level) - and it will sell out quickly. I'm not sure just how much fun the programming element will be - and I do hope the co-op mechanics will still allow for some degree of competition in tracking the amount of minions destroyed by each. Hoping it's not just flash, but holds a fair degree of substance as well.

Stellar component quality and attractive artwork. Game play and mechanics are solid as a rock and very fun.
Rules are extremely easy to pick up and teach new players. Love the slight legacy element to it and the fact it introduces complexity as you go. 
I normally hate programming games but this one smashes it out of the park for me. Top game. Everyone I play it with loves it.

Really simple at its core, but the different kinds of cards and the way damage is handled make for a very streamlined game flow. Can be a bit long, but the downtime is not grueling as you're always thinking ahead. Also, it's worth mentioning that it has one of the best rulebooks I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

Absolutely top notch production and the gameplay is right up there with the components. Riot knew what they wanted to make and they delivered in spades.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Beautiful game. The whole production is gorgeous. But it was not fun to play. The players only have minimal control over what happens. Despite any careful planning, your mech will just get wildly moved around the board by random events. After 20 minutes I stopped caring about the programming board and just watched it happen.

RATING: 10
Just fantastic. The way the missions are delivered in dossiers always leave you looking forward to what's in store next. Beautiful components and top notch space efficiency. While Riot did subsidize some of the cost, it doesn't mean that other game companies (Looking at you FFG) couldn't learn a thing or two on how to make a box insert. 
Reading the dialogue out loud is fun and the gameplay is chaotic and hilarious, while still having a great deal of depth and strategy to it. Mechanics are so easy to learn that it can be fun for groups of all ages. A must own in any board gamer's collection.

Wow, this is the way a game should be made at this price point. When you look at something like the rehashed Caverna with tons of cheap wooden meeples, meeples are cut like house molding with high speed programmed routers, the profit in them must be staggering, and their faux MSRP just a few cents under $100 and Price Flooring it, forcing an  artificial high selling price and you then compare it to MvM, what you get in the box, this game is a bargain and Caverna just looks like the over priced fluff it is.

This is a publisher that should be supported.

This is a game,  Caverna a church activity.

Easily one of the most fun, innovative, beautifully designed, well-packaged, easy-to-teach games of 2016.
We play this for hours, and go mission after mission, the only thing that stops us from playing is the sun coming up the next morning (i.e. we need to go home to our families).
Great mechanics, fast turns, lots of player interaction, no room for analysis-paralysis.
Hits the table when you have the space and a good group of high-energy people!

The Game is amazing! The tutorial is a little bit boring at first, but when you're a few minutes into mission 1 it starts getting really interesting. 
The only thing that is not that great are the rules. How they are explained is pretty cool, but they often leave you with some questions.
These great components, together with a really great Gameplay is just ridiculous for 75 dollars. 
Go get it while you still can!

We love this game in our group and I think this is the first game all four of us would like to play again 2 sessions in a row! It never happens to us!

We love the coop-part, it really works well for us. And components are so nice, you get value for your money. The "hidden" missions are nice but no big spoilers in it.

Try to locate the radioplay for missions. They are a cool addon

Great productions but what about the game.

I am not a huge fan of programmed movement and that is what this is.  I prefer competitive programmed moment because it is fun to laugh at the bad things happening to others (in a friendly way).  I like the cards building up actions to higher power levels.  It is a solid playable game but for some reason lacked FUN for my group.  I just kinda wanted to get it done with when I was playing.  I only played the first scenerio, so maybe I should have tried ti more.

The last straw was the box size.  It is too big for my shleves

RATING: 4
This is a fun little game that always seems to start out slow and ramps up into absolute craziness near the end.  You start out unable to make a decent turn or movement, and end up a minion killing machine.

In order to stick around, it will need to have a decent, generic, replayable scenario,  I'm only a few missions in, and I don't know if I would pick a specific one to replay.  But we'll see what happens when we make more progress.

Took out most of the inserts too, mainly for the minions.  Too much time to set up and take down, and takes up too much real estate.  Now we have just a big bag o' minions, and it works much better.

EDIT: Sending into long term storage until the kids are old enough.  I just don't have much interest in campaign cooperative adventure games.

I can readily see this one having new painted Mechs complete with ability cards as expansions (though not needed), although I'm not sure where I'd put them as the box is maxed out very efficiently.

RATING: 9
Spectacular production for the game. The mechanics are fairly simple and straightforward and I like the gradual addition of game mechanics. 

What makes me love this game though, is that it is a very challenging cooperative game, without the feeling that the game is just beating you down constantly. Most importantly, it is a lot of fun. Sometimes I feel that games which are mechanically very complex (for complexity's sake) are just completely devoid of fun. This game is the antithesis of that.

Hard to rate - 

+ The production values are top notch although the rule-book was not quite as 'tight' as it could have been for something with relatively simple rules.  

? The gameplay feels a little lacking with the random damage and dice-rolls making things seem a bit hollow. However after each game I am keen to set up and play again. Hmmm - I'm clearly enjoying something about it but not sure what.

Don't need to say more about the production quality: 99/10 points

Gameplay: While the game really is fun with 3-4 players (or even 2 but we only played using 2 mechs each, so basically 4 players), the randomness is a big factor taking away much strategy it could have to be a real challenging puzzle game.
Just being unlucky in your first draft you can sit around for several rounds and dragging the game on longer than is fun. If it starts with acceptable cards however it gets pretty fun fast and will stay that way for the remainder of the game. So far only mission 3 needed three tries to work, everything else solved first try (not on EZ-mode).

I would recommend it for any fan of LoL for the great collector's value of all the greatness of Runeterra, and to board games I say, give it a try somewhere and look if you like the random factor of what you are able to do in each round, or if you find it particularly annoying (like a ore strategic versed friend of mine).

The ritual of getting this set open and pulling out the pieces is more cathartic than popping bubble wrap. It is downright luxurious. The programming basis of the command line is smart; that every card drawn in a draft can be slotted to power-up makes for some intriguing strategic combinations, and drives home the massive potential of upgrading the smallest of actions. It sort of feels like the board game translation of Jake the Dog's semi-famous quote "Dude, sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something."

I can't recommend this enough. There's 10 campaign missions, and even an audio drama played before, during,  and after each mission to add to the lore. When you finish, without asking spoilers, there is an online mission builder that is ridiculously fleshed out. I played with my co-workers weekly over the span of 3 months and we always had a blast, bringing back memories of D&D nights in high school. That being said,  playing with my wife and son is the exact opposite experience, they don't grasp the programmatic play (similar to robo rally) and the game is a chore with them. For groups of players looking for great minis, hilarious chaotic gameplay, andes85 don't have someone that can/wants to be a DM, this is for you. The missions have scripting that defines what happens, so all players are playing with nobody left out for organization or orchestration.

I don't play League of Legends or have any attachment to it, so I can't tell how committed to the IP this game is. 

A more interesting version of RoboRally's model of program-your-character-action system of gameplay, and I like the drafting component as an additional dimension to the emphasis on cooperation. Smashing minions is also a lot more satisfying than what most program games offer, and makes turns feel active and rewarding. One downside is that the game often feels very linear. This is intensified by the pseudo-legacy format of adding new stuff with each successive mission. Also suffers a bit from "is this cooperative, or four people acting basically on their own?" Some of the missions are quite difficult, or at least feel difficult when you're faced with it all strewn about on the table. Coming back from overwhelming odds is fun, and this game allows for that in most cases. 

The box is full of stuff, and is organized incredibly well. That is part of the legacy, serialized format, but it also makes getting to the individual components easier.

RATING: 9.5
Wow... just wow.
The product quality is really off the charts, haven't seen any game that came close to this kind of quality. It's really impressive!
The quality is also seen in the small details they put into the story and game itself.
The pictures are funny and good looking, the little jokes are great (better if you actually know LoL, which I do), the boards with their slick looking (and feeling) oil fields are just top notch and the inserts... the inserts are just so full of little details, a lot of stuff to make it easier for the user or just some random decorations. It really is stunning.
And then of course, there is the game itself.
Together with the radio-frequences from RIOT, to create the story and plot, it makes for a wonderful experience.
The only reason I have not given this a 10 yet... the first 2 missions (and the tutorial) where still a bit easy... this is understandable, as they are still introductionary games, but alas, I do hope the games get more complex and more interesting to replay. (wouldn't mind replaying those scenario's, just would like for some even more interesting scenraio's, but understand they are comming :) )
I did like the feeling we had at the start of scenario 2. First the shock of "honestly, we have to battle so many?" It seemed impossible at first, but the mechs do get strong rather quickly and we managed without really breaking a sweat. (but we were 3 very calculative guys... and throwing red a couple of times did help :) )
So, in general, it is worth the 9.5 I give it... and maybe even the 10, if the perfect scenraio's pass our ways in the next couple of weeks.

This game hit the scene unlike anything the industry has ever scene. From the press embargo and subsequent media frenzy surrounding is announcement, to the enormous 30k print run, this game ignored all industry norms and I am happy it was so successful.

If I had one complaint, it would be that there are only 10 missions, but there are three difficulty settings (easy, normal, and special "Get Rekt" rules) to keep things going. Plenty of player made missions popping up a well.

Overall an amazing game though and already in my top 5 favorites.

They should add cards to draft as the other scenarios open up.  The existing cards get stale fairly quickly.  The game is also not difficult and the majority of the scenarios have been completed with time to spare.  They do introduce additional damage cards, but we rarely get damaged so it's not likely that we will get to see them.

This gorgeous game has strong echoes of Robo Rally, but it's a cooperative game, and what's more, it gives you a little more wiggle room than the parent game (you don't have to be able to tell your left from your right, for example.)

It also does a pretty good job of dealing with the bane of coops, the "mastermind player".

Apart from the ridiculously good components, Mechs vs. Minions is also a hugely fun cooperative programming game, with a great arc where you start with a very simple game, and layer on tweaks that are not super complex but constantly keep the game fresh.  I like the way damage cards slot into your program, and I like the timed draft to stop you from completely mathing out all the possibilities.  I also REALLY like that, unlike a game like Robo Rally, the "movement" cards give you choices about where you go, and can eventually be upgraded to allow even more choice.  The variety of objectives keep the different scenarios really fresh too - going from pushing a bomb to racing minions to fighting a boss adds a lot of flavor to the game.

My biggest complaint is honestly that it feels [b]too[/b] overproduced - without the crazy Gametrayz (that take forever to put away all the minions), the box could have been a lot smaller.  That would have been really nice.  Despite the fact that I like the game a lot, I imagine I may end up getting sold, just because of the space it takes up.

My only other complaint is that the game sometimes feels pretty easy, although some of the late missions finally seem to have ramped up the difficulty.  This is compounded by an occasional lack of balance at different player counts.  For example, certain heavily movement-focused scenarios (mission 9 comes to mind right away) are ridiculously easy with two players, because you get an additional card every round and can end up with very upgraded movement much more quickly than you would with four players.

Even with those two complaints, this sits right up there with Pandemic and Forbidden Desert as some of the best cooperative games on the market.  An awesome achievement.

+ One of the best co-op games I've played!
+ I like programming games, big Roborally fan.  This is like Roborally with special abilities, combat, and objectives!
+ Probably the best production quality for value that I've ever seen in a board game.
- Once you've played through everything it loses a little replay value.  Still totally worth it.

Wow, this could be huge :)  I need a few more plays but it is already shaping up to be one of the best games in my collection.  Enough has been said about the components and production quality, but I will reiterate it here: they are world class and on another level to anything I have seen before, all for a relatively reasonable price.  The gameplay is also extremely top tier, with just enough legacy mechanics to appeal to those who like and dislike this new subgenre.
*UPDATE - I have now played this 14 times and in my opinion it is the best co op game I have ever played and a shining example of fantastic gameplay, components and theme.

I'd honestly probably give the gameplay a 7 (very solid, but not great), but I have to add an extra point for the components.

I like the game a lot, but I don't like feeling helpless, which can happen if your mech takes a lot of damage.  I spent an entire game session stuck in a corner doing nothing for the team.  However, even with that negative aspect, this game is good and was clearly made with a lot of love.

Update: My gaming group has completed 7 of the 10 campaign missions now.  We were able to eek out victories by razor thin margins and it felt great.  The difficulty definitely cranks up over time.  The next mission's going to be tough, but we're going to have a good time.

Update 2: My gaming group has now completed 9 of the 10 campaign missions.  We're down to the finale, and I'd be lying if my group wasn't scared to play it after reading the dossier.  I'll update again with final thoughts if we ever get around to finishing it.

A játékmenet koop, programozós, kampány jellegű. Csak a tutorialt és az első küldetést toltuk le. Ezek alapján meglepően nehéznek tűnt. Nagyon előre kell tervezni a programozással, de kérdéses, hogy mennyire lehet igazából. Az első két küldetés nagyon más volt, remélem a kampányban következők is hozzák ezt a változatosságot.

It is fun to have your mech do weird things, and when your program works really well, than it's amazing. But I liked this a bit less than I thought I would. I keep feeling like the game often ends up with a 'let's see what happens next' feeling and there aren't enough meaningful choices to make. Production quality is amazing though, but I'm not sure how much I will play it after the campaign is finished.

I will start with the popular opinion that this is some of the best physical design ever: from the impeccable insert, high quality and painted minis, and rulebook design, Riot Games could be a force to be reckoned with in the future when it comes to board game production. Good golly, Ms. Molly! I'm a little wary of their distribution model, but that's not something to go into for this comment review.  I came into M vs. M as someone who dislikes RoboRally, but I thought that maybe a co-operative take on programmed movement would make it more interesting. The powering up of various moves through layering cards is the most interesting part of the game. Unfortunately, M vs. M suffers from everything I don't like about RoboRally (except the PvP meanness): chaos rules and very little can be controlled once damage starts getting in the way. As you program your moves with drafts, there are times where certain _important_ cards don't show up. For example, you may not get any movement cards and you just spend a bunch of turns rotating 90 degrees.  Certainly you can work with your opponents to make sure cards are distributed evenly, but it's never a sure thing. Plus, the game is a little on the bland side when it comes to the objectives.  And as much as I don't love the chaos, the game throws a little more in by timing how long you have to select your movement cards (which sort of eliminates the one place for careful planning). I'm glad there are many fans of this game and I don't think they're crazy for liking this. It is the type of game that certainly has an audience. But I can't help but feel like this game is way overhyped.  It seems like the more elusive and difficult it is to purchase a game through unconventional distribution means, the more hyped and "grailed" a game becomes, inflating people's ratings because they went through SO MUCH to buy a copy.  There's a good game here, but definitely not a Top 30 game of all time.

By far the coolest Amerithrash game I have ever played.  The production value is incredible: the components, minis, packaging and art are outstanding.  Great programmed movement mechanics always feel like you're driving the mech even when it's out of control with damage.  All the cards are equally valuable and there's no OP combination - what you want to draft just depends on the scenario you're working on.  Campaign mode that lets you open the various packets (that provide new cards and scenarios) really adds to the excitement of progressing in the game.

After watching videos, it seems that the game gets too repetitive- Roborally but with minions attacking (though it looks far better than Roborally). The game's incredible production value certainly is not in question- the minis are astounding for the price, which is probably one of the biggest selling points, and what makes some gamers jump up & down with absolute child-like giddiness. Also, trying to find space for that ridiculously big ass box does not help convince me to get the game, either. Why include such a huge plastic boss mini at the cost of shelf space? Without that huge boss-mini, I'm sure the box could have been condensed into a more reasonable size. All that bitching aside, for a programming game, it looks to be one of the best. I need to try it.

Ok, the components are great. But the gameplay? Hm, it felt like puzzling. I really have to think about buying it or not. Because I can easily place 4 other games on my shelf instead of MvM...

We played the first mission and it took us about 2 hours to complete it! After a while it was just boring repetitive.

Looks great. Had to pre-order as it looks like it will sell out fast again. The whole family can't wait for this to arrive. Should be good for teaching the kids coding.

It came today and I have two words to describe the size and quality - HOLY SHIT!
How they ever managed to produce an amazing premium game for such a low cost is unreal. Seriously. Unreal.
Even if you hate the game, it's worth it just for eyeball candy. No joke.

After playing this with my kids there is a brilliant game under all this chrome as well! We all loved what we've seen so far and it provides a really fun experience. If you are a fan of co-ops or RoboRally then this indeed the game for you.
Both me and the kids are anxious to play more.
It's a great looking and really fun game for the whole family. And your kids will learn some programming to boot!

Still holding strong, and the semi-legacy aspect is kind of neat. A very fun game that looks absolutely amazing when set up and during play.

What a game! The box, the materials, the miniatures,...everything in the box is awesome. I own many games with miniatures and stuff, but I have never seen anything like that.
Apart from that the game itself reminds me of robo ralley (one of my favorite games). You program your mechs to move, turn or shoot. You take damage, use abilities and kill minions. Great fun! I also love that the game is fully co-operative.
The game manual starts with a brief introduction, before you start playing. New rules are added with every new mission. Each mission comes with its own envelope containing a new rule book, and other new stuff.
Overall: the best game I've seen and played so far!

A very solid game that I would play willingly. But make no question, this game is light and chaotic, not strategic. I'm not sure this would get replayed a lot if not for the campaign component.

Component quality and overall value raise the score 0.50.

I've only played the tutorial and the first mission. I can only imagine the complexity and intensity increases as the missions go on. Phenomenal game. I used to love league of legends years ago before they went and screwed everything up, so the IP was familiar to me, but not something I was particularly enamored with.

If you don't like programming from roborally  because of the intense amount of screwing people over please do yourself a favor and still give this a try. It's a co-op game so none of that, and even if you hate it, the game is 75 bucks and the minis alone more than make up for the price tag.

No question: the component and packaging quality is beyond anything I've ever seen.  The manuals are well-written and engaging.  The art and theme are well-integrated.  Near faultless in all ways outside the gameplay.

I just don't think it's a fun game.  You can start out with a brilliant plan in mind, but then you have to deal with the 1) (random) availability of cards shared by all players in the card draft phase, 2) (random) reordering of your slots based on damage, 3) (random) involuntary movement of your mech due to damage or other players, and 4) almost meaningless movement of dozens of minions each turn...

This is a game that promised interesting and meaningful choices based on the command line ordering, leveling up of each slot, sets of abilities and unique mech abilities.  In reality, it's a game where your best plan in all situations is to set your slots to blow up as much stuff as possible, knowing that your damage will never be exactly where you want it, and knowing that you have little control over your own movement.

Sigh.

RATING: 8.7
Quite a pleasant surprise. Takes simple programmed movement and crosses it with a mission based game that goes from Tower Defense to Hunt The Baddy style missions. 
In the realm of mechanics for enjoyment punch it really knocks it out of the park. A great gateway game that can be enjoyed by your average BGG user too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good cooperative game with an original mechanic of drafting cards to program actions. It feels like a videogame, with minions being easy to kill, but constantly re-spawning. The difficulty comes from the fact that you only get one or two cards per round to add to your command line or replace cards already there. You never reset your programmed actions, thus your mechs does not always behave as you want.

I only disliked the timed draft (we just didn't use the hourglass) and the tutorial method of learning the game. There is a rules reference book, but it didn't help when there were doubts (for example, which minions move first?).

I'm not a fan of the childlike characters and general cartoony look, but the production is excellent, with lots of miniatures in well-crafted inserts. They take a lot of space, though, and I wouldn't mind to toss the miniatures in bags if the trade-off were a box half the size (it's huge). The campaign system has a "legacy" style, with sealed envelopes to be opened at the start of each scenario, but (apparently) without the stupidity of defacing or destroying components.

Edit: Had to raise it to 10 because, what a freaking great game. I always have so much fun playing it. Literally in the zone every time.

I love the logic puzzles that the command deck creates. Opening the box felt like Christmas! I never saw a box that big, with so many components - and boy those components are AMAZING - for the price tag that they are selling.

The rule book is really good - the tutorial book sets you up for playing in a matter of minutes. It really explains the concept of the game while you play in a really easy way. One weird thing about it is that I didn't see any specifications of number of players, average play time, that kind of stuff.

The game has incredible replayability and somewhat a "legacy" aspect to it, since you only open missions when you pass to next one.

Move over Space Hulk, we now have a new King of Overproduced Games. And it's actually pretty fun! The gradual, evolutionary approach to programming helps the game grow organically, and it's a joy to have the body count rise so dramatically with minimal rules overhead. The game can drag if you don't keep your eyes on the prize, as it were, so make sure you're emphasizing the scenario's victory conditions if there isn't a built-in timer.

I was surprised that i enjoyed playing this as much as i did. I don't really enjoy co-op games and I'm not a huge fan of programmable movement. But there is something that just feels good about mowing down groups of minions. And when your system is going strong and you're doing great things, life can't get any better. Though i can see where a couple bad draws or some bad luck can sour you on a particular game. I did not do as well the first mission and mostly had to sit back and watch my friends have fun while i tried to right everything terrible happening to my mech. Still, the high was way higher than the low. Definitely recommend. 

Also, even though I've been playing league since season one, one of our players had never touched the game and still had high praise for it afterwards.

RATING: 9
Mechs vs Minions is a programming puzzle-game that is most of the times noted for the high production value. One thing that isn't voiced enough is that this game is perfect for solo players. 

The game can get quite chaotic especially at the later levels when you gotta keep in mind the minion movement + spawning rules for the level plus boss attacks + movements and the (de)activation of gates. My group of friends has a hard time remembering rules so it's always up to me to keep everyone in check. Chaos is a big part of the point in this game and due to that it became way too frustrating to me with the people I tend to play. (They loved MvsM, by the way). 

However, the experience is completely different as a solo player. The game becomes less chaotic and much more tactical. Playing solo the card drafting isn't nowhere as random and the experience actually feels like a puzzle. With 10 different levels there's also replay value compared to many other games where you're essentially replaying the same level over and over again. The only downside is that some levels are clearly designed for 4 mechs which can become too much to handle.

Very beautiful cooperative programming style game that works well for my family.  In fact, my kids can't seem to get enough of it.  They beg to play it all the time.  Pretty good replayability.  I would love to see more content from Riot or support for fan made content. The rule books are a bit terse but there are good clarifications online.

Played a 4 player game, with a single experienced player.  Rules were fairly straightforward and easy to grasp.

Programming your Mech is easy, but since it's a draft with one (2 or 3) spare cards, you are often left with choices that are useless, or you are looking to trash "repair" cards to gain some control back.

As one of the players was experienced, we played a scenario he had not tried before; we all had to cross the board while preventing the Minions from getting to the last row on our side.

Although gameplay was fairly easy, it was way too random, with damage locking many of your six slots or randomizing your "program".  More often then not I did not go anywhere near where I wanted to go and was even stuck on the starting row for 3 turns as I had no movement cards...

Production value is awesome, with detailed minis and 4 large painted Mechs.  The insert is perfect so no need to pick up one of those expensive wooden ones or make one out of foam core.

Can only be picked up directly from the publisher, which is a pain, not to mention $32+ in shipping and duties,  which is about 33% the cost of the game, makes this a tad expensive.  But folks on KS appear to be happy paying $100+ for any game with miniatures, and this one has a lot.

Gameplay was just not all that fun, as it felt more like trying to figure out a puzzle with someone shuffling your pieces every turn.  Enjoyed RoboRally more than this one, for half the price.

A ton of components in the game's box, for a reasonable price (75€=8kg).
I like the programming aspects, and the fact that a card has more than one consequence once slotted, and more than one use (slot vs scrap). I played with 2 groups of friends. One had ample time with the 30 second timer, having chatted about who needs what in advance. The other one barely made it at each programming phase, because some tried to discuss agaon after we had set our card goals.
I haven't played through the whole game yet, so I cannot speak for replayability.
(I still haven't opened the box with the axe!)

Note: I got this in March, even though the website said production wave 1 (30000 units) was already spent and done and we had to wait for wave 2. I effectively got a game numbered in the 28000's.

Amazing game! One of the best games I've ever played. The attention to detail is insane. The only minor quirk is it would be nice if each mission had a summary of the rules and objectives on the back of each mission book. That's an incredibly minor quirk, and easy to overcome.

What a crazy overproduced game! If you're going to go all out, go ALL out. This is the most lavish game I own. As a long time LoL player, it's fun to see the world they created. I was suspicious at first, but the game is solid. It doesn't need to be as produced as it is, but the price is unlike anything out there for the value. This game shares a lot of similarities with Rogue Moon.

Beautiful components, fun coding game, with incredible production value, where you program your mech to defeat minions. I love the different secret missions - hidden in secret folders until you succeed at the current mission. I wonder if the game might get less interesting over time, are you merely whacking minions with different completion objectives, or is there more depth? Unfortunately, I do not have the game to find out for myself. Rating could go up or down depending on the answer to that question.

I'm big time into board games and video games. LoL is my current favorite video game, so when this board game was announced, I knew I'd buy it. Played it for the 1st time last night, and it did not disappoint. The designers weave an element of RPG style discovery throughout the game, and even the tutorial. The game play mechanics involve a bit of a steep learning curve, but once you're done with the 1st mission, it clicks and you are able to then be fully immersed in the game without stopping to think and read what happens next.

Everything about this game is quality. The components, the gameplay, even the story campaign. It takes a while to get the hang of it, and at first you won't have too much control over what you do and you think it's not great... but then you start understanding the game and getting into it and you start planning 2,3,4 turns ahead and suddenly the game gets much more interesting. Hard to find the right group of people to play with as it is a game that requires more dedication towards, as with most campaign games, but it's just so much fun once you get the hang of it. Every mission has been so different so far, it's just great.

So I've twice played the first three scenarios, if you count the warm-up mission as "games".  It's been fun but it's not really my type of game.  I was intrigued by the hype and the low price for such a spectacle of a game.  It's not the first time...

I can't say it's not worth the price I paid but I don't actually have a space for this HUGE box.  It's literally sitting on the floor in my game room.  I'll play it a few more times but I'll likely trade it away sooner rather than later.

Crazy robot programming game based on League of Legends characters. The real time programming aspect makes it so one person can't control the whole game and decisions have to be made fast. Also fits in the theme of trying to get your robot to do what you want while being assailed on all sides by minions and explosive ordnance.

There's a campaign system which slowly unlocks more game content as you go and the flavor text in there is nice. Good campaign pacing as well as you add more and more mechanics to the game so you don't get overloaded.

The component quality is amazing. Cards are sturdy, the 4 mech miniatures are well painted. The minion miniatures are good quality as well and come pre dipped/shaded so they stand out a bit more than just flat grey. All the metal gears and plastic crystals are really nice looking and it comes in a very nice insert that actually fits everything very well. Amazing production value for the price tag.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2016)

I finally played the fabled Mechs vs. Minions. Buying it was very time consuming because Riot´s webpage was hammered by thousands of people trying to buy the game, so it took the better part of 3 hours to buy it. Importing it to my country was very expensive due to its great size and weight.

Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative programing game in the vein of RoboRally, but much better! It doesn’t remove the alpha leader effect most CoOps have though.

Many friends were very excited to play it so we played it. Be advised however, that I have only played the tutorial and the first scenario, I think I will play the whole campaign, but I’m not burning in desire to do so (there are hundreds of better and heavier games in my list to play). Those scenarios I played were way too easy but I expect (hope) the difficulty to increase a lot with the following scenarios.

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. I really like that more rules and complexity are introduced when you play more scenarios, this make the game very easy to teach.

The theme is there, but I’m neutral towards it.

The game components are AMAZING, from the miniatures, to the insert (the best I have seen ever!), everything looks great. The art is very good, but some friends didn’t like the style. The game really is cheap for the quality of the components inside, however I’m disappointed that Mechs vs. Minions only comes with 10 scenarios, in that sense the game is very expensive with a  low replay value. These scenarios introduce new rules and you only need to read them before you play with them (a semi Legacy style). When you reach a checkpoint, the game springs surprises without permanently changing the game, thus, you retain the commercial value of the game, that is on my book much better than the Legacy way.

The gameplay isn’t as good as the game components sadly! I feel the success of the game is due to a great looking game and a very well managed marketing campaign (limited buys, very high expectative). I saw many people taking selfies with the game in their hands proud to own the game :D, there is no question it is a very popular game.

Mechs vs. Minions follows the formula of Cool Mini or Not, a great looking game with shallow gameplay (although I prefer this game to any CMON game). The decisions needed to play the game aren’t hard (you just need to choose one or two cards per turn), just the opposite, they are rather easy and obvious. The bests feature is the drafting under pressure, but that´s only important at the beginning of each scenario. At the end you, most likely, will have some kind of engine going on, so you don´t need to draft more cards as any other card would damage your engine. To summarize this point, I feel the game has mostly obvious decisions, I prefer to play something heavier. I do like the AI of the minions.

When a minion hits you, you draw a random hit that can potentially screw up your plans. There is lots of uncontrollable luck with this feature and I, somewhat, dislike it. However as there are many minions in the map, you will likely hit one of the anyway. Also as the gameplay is rather fast I don’t mind much about the luck.

Bottom line, Mechs vs. Minions is a borderline 5.5 to me. An ok game to play from time to time but way overhyped/overrated. The game components affect the rating of the game a lot. Its best feature is its amazing production values and it has the best insert ever, however when the best a game has to offer is the insert you can imagine I don´t like the gameplay very much. I think I will play the whole campaign because I’m already committed and we will see if I will change my mind when I get to play the other scenarios, so far it has been very easy. I think the game can be an outstanding family game to play with children, but it is way too light for my current tastes, for me it is a casual game. I already sold my copy of the game.

While most other establish companies are busy cranking up their prices it's heartening to see a relative outsider come along and at once deliver a game that both is staggeringly well made as well as seemingly great value for money.

I originally had this game rated an 8, but we got hooked into the campaign and played a couple times a week until we completed it. That's 21 plays (twice through the tutorial for different people) in a few weeks. the game is addictive. If I felt like now I was just going to put it on a shelf until there is an expansion, I'd probably keep it at an 8, but I want to break it out with a friend and go through some of the missions I already completed.
All of these plays so far were 2-player except the first tutorial when I was learning the game to spare my wife. Most of the missions play really well at 2 players, but a couple are obviously easier (like when all the Mechs have to be in one location at the end of a player round) and a couple that are probably harder, but I didn't feel like scaling each mission was necessary.
We played without the timer for drafting cards since that would have applied a level of stress that would have made the game less enjoyable for my wife. We still tried to do it quickly, but I am sure that if we would have implemented the timer we would have needed 20-25% more games to complete the campaign.

The game is very well developed. A lot of effort has gone into streamlining the game and it shows. The production value is also off the charts.

The programed action part of the game works well. It presents just enough control and lack of control to keep you second guessing which cards to add to your queue and where. Players start out struggling to turn in the right direction and by the late game they are sleek killing machines. This progression feels great.

Where the game falters is where so many co-ops have issue and that is with tension. The game is simply too easy and it fails at fooling you into thinking it's close. There is no way for the game to step up the difficulty if you are doing well. This is mostly due to their decision to keep things simple and probably also due to the fact that they've aimed the game at a more casual crowd and we are grizzled co-op players and gamers in general. We are hoping that the hard setting will be more tense leading to games that come right down to the wire.

I'm concerned about the replay of the scenarios. There are only a few that seem to have enough variety to warrant several plays.

It took a lot of plays for me to feel as though I could rate this game. It started pretty "Meh" but brought me back with the components. By the time the Big-Guy comes out the game gets a lot better.... but even before that we had a game come down to a 1 in 4 chance to 'survive' and somehow did... and then won. 

I suggest continuing to advance in the scenarios even if you lose an early-ish one because there isn't too much to gain by replaying those. It gets better later.

That being said, the game has very little in regards to tactical decisions. If you feel like Catan has deep strategy... then sure you'll feel similar here. If you feel like each move in Catan is obvious after board setup (excluding trading decisions)... you will feel similar here. But this game has 2 things Catan doesn't. 1) Crazy miniature quality (I mean crazy!).  2) Those epic moments that make you cheer or want to turn the table,

The game escalates in such a fun and exciting way from the tutorial to Mission 1 and all throughout! Each mission reminded me of moving through a coherent story just like Pandemic legacy. This game also has replay-ability. 
The only issue I found with the game was that some scenarios varied greatly in difficulty depending on how many players there were.

A solid cooperative programming game offers superior components and thought-provoking strategy. The theme doesn't especially shine through, but I'm not a League of Legends guy, so perhaps that's why. And programming games aren't really in my wheelhouse.

You know the drill by now:

- Components are top notch
- Gameplay is super fun
- Missions are a lot harder than you would imagine

maybe i will write some more after playing it some more.

The only downside i can find so far are the rules, but you can solve most of the unclear points by intuition or by looking at the faq.

As many have mentioned the production value in this box is crazy, but aside from that the co-op programming gameplay is actually very good! Fun and engaging, each mission adds new challenges, the only reason this doesn't rate higher is really the gigantic box size (I don't host much and it's too big to carry to meetups).

Fantastic production quality, great value for what they are charging for it. As far as the gameplay goes, it's just tremendous. As someone who normally doesn't like programming games, the co-op nature of this and the teamwork required in this really negates any negativity I had toward programming games. 

The leveling of your characters, being able to decide how to approach each game, even the light campaign aspect of the game, discovering new things as the campaign rolls on is great. I expected alot out of this and it more than lived up for me.

My family's favourite game when we first received it. We've played this every weekend since receiving it and still always look forward to it. 

My two boys love miniature games so I knew this would be a hit with them. My daughter usually finds miniature games "too geeky" but still loves this game. I think that is partly due to the lovely components and that one of the mechs is female :)

Downsides are that the latter missions don't have the same elegance and snap of earlier missions; new mechanics keep coming, bloating an elegant system; and very difficult to introduce new players mid-campaign.

A harmadik küldetésnél járva ez eddig egyértelműen max pontszám. Egyedül a szabályok egyértelműsítésében lehetne fejlődni, de végül is kooperatív játék, lehet bizonyos dolgokat rugalmasan kezelni. :P

A kivitelezést, és ennek megfelelően az árazást tekintve is etalon a MvM, ebben az árkategóriában példátlan mennyiségű és minőségű cucc van a dobozban. Én nagyon szeretem a programozós játékokat, és itt kimondottan felvillanyozott a kooperativitás ezzel kapcsolatban. Kettesben játsszuk a küldetéseket, mindig megoldhatatlanul nehéznek tűnik az újabb kihívás, de egészen ráéreztünk a programozásra és az együttműködés lehetőségeire. Úgy érzem, hogy a küldetés rendszer ellenére is magas az újrajátszhatósága, mert most úgy látom, bármely eddigit újrakezdeném, mindegyik kellően más volt a többihez képest. Na majd kiderül, hogy a többinél mi a helyzet. :)

I rate board games pretty low on average compared to others. Partly because I've played well over 2,000 different ones and what might be new to you is just another variation of the same chocolate frosting to me.  Mechs vs. Minions left me speechless.  It works on every level of everything it sets out to be.  Everything that can be so frustrating and annoying about other programmed movement/action games is pure bliss in this one.  It really doesn't feel random at all and yet wrenches are still thrown in to disrupt you.  Meaningful decisions are plentiful and outcomes are satisfying even when not too your liking.  To that point I don't think I've ever enjoyed losing at a cooperative game more nor have I ever been more enthusiastic to replay the same mission/game that I just lost.  Physical components match the exceptional gameplay quality and the value for the price is absurdly high.  If I had to come up with one minor flaw it would be in the lack of gameplay examples in the rules and/or detailed card summary.  Those provided leave things open to interpretation that less experienced gamers wouldn't necessarily get correct.  Though I made no mistakes I must confess at least a half dozen times during just the tutorial and first mission having to double check online that my interpretations were correct.  Still, overall the rules presentation and layout are very good and in the end all my assumptions were correct.  It's quite possible, despite that complaint, that this is the best I've ever seen a game introduce the rule set via tutorials and gradual rules additions per mission. It makes the game not only more approachable initially but easier to get back into if you do put it back on the shelf for awhile.  Sure we are all excited to read that lengthier rule book the first time when you get the game but far less so when you pick it back up to potentially play months later.  Mechs vs Minions will never have that problem.  Board game publishers seem unaware of this issue or at least uncreative in their attempted solutions thus far. I find it refreshing that a Video Game company can understand right out of the gate that the game need not be dumbed down to be accessible.  It need only have its rule set and gameplay be presented In an easily learnable format.  I really hope Riot Games decides to make expansions and/or other board games as well! They should be very very proud what they accomplished on their first try.

A very fun game with absolutely phenomenal high quality game parts. Everything about this game just screams quality, from the minis to the packaging. The radio play that is available on the publisher's website, enhances gameplay even more. I like how you have to make strategic decisions and communicate with your fellow players to make it through the missions, while the gameplay in essence stays really simple so that even less experienced gamers can play this. I also really like the envelope system that unlocks new stuff after every mission, so you're eager to go on and find out what gets unlocked next. Overall this is probably one of the best games I have played lately. Now if I just found some space to store that huge box...

Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative tabletop campaign for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test.

Achtung: kleine Spoiler!

Mission 4:
In dieser Mission geht es darum die gegenüberliegende Seite zu erreichen, bevor die Minions ihre gegenüberliegende Seite erreichen. (man läuft gegeneinander, aneinander vorbei).
Wir mussten von der Mitte nochmals ganz an der Anfang spurten um einen durchgelassenen Minion noch abzufangen, und konnten danach nochmal herumdrehen und haben es gerade so ins Ziel geschafft.
Das war eine echt coole Mission

Mission 5:
In dieser Mission wird man von einer "rollenden" Lavawand verfolgt und man muss eine Bombe auf bestimmte Wegpunkte auf dem Weg zurm Ziel schieben/ziehen.
Anfangs war es so aufgeteilt, dass ich die Minions kill, während mein Mitspieler die Bombe zerrt. Nach 2-3 Runden habe ich die Bombennavigation übernommen und Yuna durfte die Horde abwehren, was sehr gut funktioniert hat.

Mission 6:
Ein weiterer Bosskampf, der aber sehr einfach ist, da man effektiv nur am Boss vorbeit durch ein Tor ins Ziel laufen muss. Dabi laufen der Boss und die Minions random irgendwohin und wenn Platz ist kann man durchschlüpfen.
Mit Abstand die schlechteste Mission bisher.

Mission 7:
Diese Mission läuft ähnlich wie die "Schule unter Belagerung" Mission ab, nur dass man auf den Kristallen startet und man erstmal schnellstmöglich durch die Minions hindurch zur Mitte kommen muss um von dort die Minions fernzuhalten. Dabei ist das Feld Labyrinthartig.
Hat mir echt gut gefallen.

Mission 8:
Die beste und knappeste Mission des Abends!
Die in Mission 7 gebaute Bombe sollten wir nun durch das Lavalabyrinth zum Endziel schleppen, bevor sie kaputt geht.
Mein Mitspieler hatte irgendwann auf jedem Slot eine Beschädigung und nochmal eine extra Übergreifende, als 7 Beschädigungen gleichzeitig, hat sich daraus aber wieder komplett freikämpfen können, auch wenn er durch all diese Fehler wieder und wieder in die ´Lava tappte und so reperaturen über Reperaturen durchziehen musste. Es war schon sehr Lustig.
Als dann die Bombe auf 1 Lebenspunkt viel und er durch seine Beschädigungen dann das Reparaturfeld blockierte, auf das ich die Bombe schieben wollte wars noch viel toller!
Das wir das dann doch noch geschafft haben war echtes Können von uns beiden.
Ich hatte seinen Mech aber richtig vor Augen, wie er da oben auf dem Ding sitzt und es nur noch strauchelte, hier und da in die Lava tappte und er obenauf alle Hände mit Reparaturen zu tun hatte um den Mech einigermaßen betriebsbereit zu halten... Echt tolle Mission. Die beste des Abends wie ich finde.

Mission 9:
Eine super dupper absolut mega LANGWEILIGE Mission!
Man wird von der Lava verfolgt und muss zum Ende laufen. Dabei laufen die Minions absolut Random… Mega Öde!
Waren am Ende, noch bevor die Lava das erste Brett geschafft hatte...

Mission 10:
Endlich mal ein Bossfight der was taugt. Sehr sehr cool gemacht, fand ich echt super und gar nicht mal so einfach.
Wenn er jetzt noch Karten spielen könnte (zB immer wenn er ein Stufe 2 Befehl ausführt läd er 1 Kristall wieder auf), dann wärs vielleicht noch ein Tick lustiger geworden.
Es wurde zwischendrin auch mal kurzzeitig knapp, als er schon 2 grüne Befehle hatte und wir 2 grüne vom Stapel zogen...

When this was all the buzz a few weeks ago I had no idea what it was. I've never heard of "League of Legends" (and still don't know exactly what that is), so by the time I had a handle on what people were talking about, it was already sold out. It's a gorgeously overproduced co-op game with a million minis and a bunch of scenarios. Everything about it, even down to the packaging, shows some great thought and it's a lot of fun. I'm a big fan of RoboRally, and I thought this used the programming mechanism quite well, in addition to the fun damage mechanism. Just an absolute treat.

Pretty fun game that works whether you like League or not. The components are REALLY good, definitely the best part of the game. It just feels so high quality. 

The mechanics are pretty fun, though at times you feel like you don't have much control over your character (due to the programming) and you may have some useless turns; note: I could just suck at this kind of game.

The campaign is cool, but some of the missions feel samey. Overall, great collection item for League fans (or fans of high quality game components), and fun to play every now and again, but not something I crave.

So much to say about this game! The gameplay is very good, two of my friends immediately preordered copies from the next printing after playing it. It's a well-designed mix of programming/dudes-on-a-map/variable player powers. The intro is amazing, the first scenario in the campaign is a great tutorial that easily teaches the rules to anyone one step at a time. The programming and damage system keep it from being very much of an exercise of long-term strategy and optimization like I tend to prefer, but those same things added to the great tutorial and it being a co-op make it a great game to play with inexperienced or less serious gamers.

And the components... *swoon*... total eye candy. The quality is amazing, the players' mech minis are large and painted, the minion minis come in at least three different poses and are washed in a darker grey to bring out the details. And the insert is completely awe-inspiring and drool-worthy... four different layers, each piece has an obvious and well-fitted slot (somehow they designed a slot that perfectly holds any of the minion poses), and each layer has its own cover. I wish more companies put a fraction of that much thought into their inserts, and especially into their rules presentation.

Outstanding production, this should be a model followed by all! Nice thick box, durable plastic inserts for all content, nice minis and other components that fit perfectly in the box and very thematic scenario documents. Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative clone or Roborally. One significant difference is that Roborally has laser fire for each robot on every turn at the end of their movement, Mechs vs. Minions has multiple types of cards that are drafted including movement, weapons, and other effects. These build-up over rounds and can stack. Sounds really cool, but in practice it slows down the start of each round and makes it less fun. Also, the tons of minis that spawn on the board make defeating them pretty bland. As great as the production is, Roborally is a better game.

This is definitely an incredible game.

The components are beyond any criticism. This is easily one of the most beautifully designed and qualitatively produced games I have ever seen. And all this for an unbeatable price, which makes most of my other games seem overpriced in comparison.

The game itself, apart from all its beautiful components is also very good. It offers quite a lot of tactics while still managing to keep the rules extremely simple without any exceptions or unnecessary complexity. You only need to read 4 pages of rules, before you can already start playing. To put it in one word, the rules are elegant. I also very much appreciate the game being cooperative, which makes for a very entertaining time.

The missions included in this set are quite varied and each offers a different kind of challenge and experience. I was especially excited about the boss fight, which almost played like a computer game, which was awesome.

I honestly cannot say anything negative about this game, which is why it deserve a 10 from me and my highest recommendations.

As a co-op with little randomness, there's a lot of potential for quarterbacking but it's deftly sidestepped by the hard time limit of drafting, and the pure amount of chaos that the mechs inflict on a turn by turn basis. Especially once everyone has 4 or 5 cards and pushing/pulling becomes a thing. It's a fine balance between keeping (more or less) control of your own mech while everyone else is doing wild and crazy plays, successfully done.

What is it about this game?  Programming games are nowhere near my favorite genre (can't stand Roborally and Colt Express is just ok) and coops don't tend to light my world on fire.  However, I didn't want to stop playing MvM and can't wait to play again.

Positives:
Gorgeous components
Straightforward gameplay

Neutrals:
A lot of stuff in the box, which can make setting up and tearing down a bit of a pain for such a quick, light game.

An amazing production and a fun game too! The component quality is absolutely the best in the hobby and the programming gameplay is smooth. The missions run through in a tutorial style that introduces new elements over time, adding complexity and depth. Easy to learn yet fun and tough at the same time, this game is both an ideal gateway and meetup regular.

RATING: 6
Managed to play two games of this and while it is a good game, I feel it is way overhyped .

I feel the decision making is very lackluster since your moves are completely based on card draws.  On my very first game, I didn't get to move my mech until the third round because no movement cards showed up.  

Even after decking my Command LIine with moves, I've felt the game just went through the same motions over and over unless you get damage cards that screw up the Command Line.  Otherwise, you're doing more of the same throughout the entire match.

As for the difficulty, it wasn't a cakewalk but I felt most of the difficulty didn't come from the terrain or scenarios, but the cards themselves.  Similar to other co-operative games, it's not the mechanics that make the game challenging, but the random nature of the game.

However, it's still a decent game for what it is, but is it the best game?  Not by a longshot.

Mechs vs. Minions in not the best game ever unlike some people expected it to be, but it is one of the best games of the year nevertheless. While it doesn't offer super complex mechanics and really deep gameplay, it offers solid and fun gameplay with some interesting ideas. The "legacy" like elements keep the game interesting and I'm curious to see what's waiting for us in the following missions.

Component quality is top notch, although the setup and teardown is unnecessarily troublesome because they've put the board tiles and other most used components in the undermost tray. Rulebooks could also be better as some questions are left unanswered.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very difficult to dislike this charmer. Make no mistake, this is fairly light, and it also shows how hard it is to design and write good rules even with the ridiculous amount of attention to detail on display here. As a game experience, it seriously reminds me of playing through HeroQuest with a group of friends a few decades ago. This game facilitates a similar level of "fun with your buddies," with even less rules overhead. 

That being said, this is an up-to-date design. It is mainly deterministic within a single turn, so most errors could have been avoided by pondering longer, which the sand timer puts and end to after 40 seconds. The phase of actually programming your mech is untimed, but at this stage you are dealing with a substantially smaller decision space (meaning, if you have screwed up your mission, it has mostly happened already during the timed phase).

So interestingly, this game is not really about managing probability a la Blood Bowl and Critical Hits and the like, which means the deterministically induced "randomness" may sometime feel unthematic, but that is a minor quibble.

I probably rate this game higher than I should because it is difficult to subtract the production value. I think it would still be a good game with cubes and markers; on the other hand, board game minis don't do that much for me anyway. But the whole package (cardboard quality, dices, metal components, etc.) is top-notch and even exemplary in some ways, like the Game Trayz-designed box inserts, the very efficient use of component given all the lavishness, etc.

The sum is better than its parts. There are some emergent qualities to this very round package.

Using Robo-Rally style programmed orders is just a fantastic basis for a co-operative game. Instantly solves issues like alpha-dog and lack of replay value. Fun and funny but also fiddly to set up given the strong randomness in the cards on offer, offset somewhat by the stunning presentation.

Purchased direct from Riot 10/13/16.

Production quality is absolutely astounding.  Everything from the pre-painted miniatures to the well thought out and organized insert screams "quality".  More importantly, the gameplay is compelling as well.  The surprise Escalations constantly throw new wrenches into our well laid plans.  The draft also challenges us every round to adapt to what we're given.  I was surprised by how difficult it would be to just tow a bomb in a straight line in the first mission.  You really need to manage your command line efficiently.

The minion AI is streamlined and not fiddly at all.  The campaign gives all the fun of opening new envelopes in a legacy game without compromising replayability.  The hourglass use in the draft really helps cut down on AP.  There isn't anything else like this in the collection.

The Radioplay (from Riot's website) is a great addition that adds a lot of flavor.  I love that they use professional voice actors with flavor text beyond the mission guide.

My only criticisms are that the insert can be a bit awkward when popping out dozens of minions and that I can see the programming being AP inducing for some gamers.

This highly immersive cooperative programming game could have really had any theme, though the League of Legends theme works well given all the minions. What's amazing is how much fun and hilarity emerges from a very simple design of programming your mechs and watching them try to achieve the objective on hand. There's no alpha player problem, very little downtime, and not a minute that's not exciting. Oh, and aping the Legacy aspect is actually really well done with all the secret envelopes that give you a little dopamine rush when you open them, but not actually permanently changing the game state or hurting the replayability. Well done, Riot!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Amazingly fun and entertaining cooperative programming game with an engaging theme and a campaign mode that draws you in by introducing new mechanisms over the course of multiple missions, ramping up the complexity and options so that no one feels overwhelmed.

The components, incidentally, are some of the best I've ever seen in boardgaming, with paint jobs on the hero and boss figures that look like they were done by hand by professional miniature painters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Good: 
The theme, co-op nature, card drafting, and ability to change the card line-up allows for the programming portion of this game to actually entertaining. (I dislike many of the older programming games).

The scenarios add cards and mechanics as you play making it easy to just start a game and gradually pick up increasingly advanced rules without realizing it. Additionally, it is fun earning new abilities and then selecting the ones that will best work with the current mission objective. 

The mission objectives change as you progress so the gameplay feels different. An example is one mission you are dragging objects to specific locations, others you are killing bosses, others you are trying to outrun hazards. 

Amazing component quality. 

Bad: 
The game does a good job of reducing AP during the card drafting phase by adding a timer to the phase. However, depending on who you are playing with, can end up taking a looong time determining the optimal move they can execute with their programmed cards. Do not play with folks who are AP prone. 

Although any scenario can be played, so you can introduce new players to the early scenarios, if you are plying through the campaign with a group the sealed packets have a legacy feel to them so you will likely want to play through the game with one game group before opening the packets during one-off sessions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very thematic and interesting programming game. The production value is out of this world! I enjoy opening up every single scenario to see what the new objective is.

My main complaint is how each of the characters feels pretty samey. They all have their own blueprint cards, but other than that, nothing is really all that different between them. I hope that they bring out more scenarios in the future.

RATING: 9
Awesome production value. The gameplay is simple but really fun. I don't like programming games, but this one does it right. I'm curious to see what I'll do with the game after I'll finish all 10 scenarios. I'll probably keep it to play with my son later.

Amazing game!  

As many others have said, the components are top-notch.  This is my 1st real programming game and I'm loving it.  Up until now most programming games did not appeal to me, but the theme here and components really make the game standout.  Given the random \ unpredictable nature of programming the cards, I don't worry too much about tactics and just play to have fun.  The rules are very easy to learn and follow.

While the replay-ability might not be as high as some other games, it is still fun to play once in a while and I do enjoy the different varied missions (tower defense, search and destroy, escort, etc.).

The box for this is ludicrous.  But I have to admit the inserts are really, really well done.  Episodic game of battling minions and accomplishing missions that are revealed in some sealed envelopes, wherein you also get some additional cards as you go along.  Pre-programming as in RoboRally.  Yes, another cooperative game, but it does seem to be more fun than Robo and the damage cards are pretty fun.  However, once you strip away all the plastic, it is a decent game but perhaps not much more.  Do the ratings all come from the materials in the box?  I have a sneaking suspicion this is so.  If you replaced all the minions with chits, the overall game score would be a seven, perhaps?  Well, if the plastic gets people to play your game, fine, I guess, but it takes it out of my price and storage range.  It is fun to look at but I am not getting games for the look.  Had a great time playing with Bartel, Bianca and jeroenD, though!

This game is easy to learn and has great replay value. The presentation is wonderful. From the minitatures, to the Visuals of the board and rule book. It all looks awesome. The basics of the game reminded me of robo rally. The comand boards and cards to execute them. But the game quickly gets more depth after the introduction scenario. The story driven missions add a lot of extra flavor, not just new rules and challenges.

The programing part was neat, yet the "sweeping minions apart" is not enough compelling to me? Themless i guess? Which is weird because i can usually ignore the theme if a game lacks of it, and still have fun (if the game is good). The general hype didn't helped much either.

Bought wave 1 copy from Riot on 10/13/16. Played a few times now (5ish). It's pretty fun but so far I'm seeing lots of chrome and not as much longevity as I would have liked. Build-up of your mech's programming is very similar from game to game.

Another problem is that if you're doing well, in late game there isn't a whole lot to do -- you don't care much what cards come out because your program is pretty well set up already. So it breaks down to adding minions to the board then mowing them down. That's satisfying once or twice but not over the long haul.

Kind of wish I just played someone elses copy a few times for the novelty rather than buying my own copy.

Super HYPE!!

A co-op that is INCREDIBLE value for money production wise, and super doper fun to boot!

Yes, it isn't very tactical (really), but my wife (technically a non-gamer) is hooked on it and so is her little sister, so that is a mega bonus for me as I get to play it!

While it may seem like you don't have much control over what your Mech is doing, surprisingly there is a good amount of depth and strategy in knowing what to pick to use or scrap, and how to chain your commands.

The legacy style aspect has the wife hooked as well, which makes each scenario a fresh new experience (with a few more schematics or objectives added as well)

Price point is great, but shipping to AUS is super expensive.  Still, overall I would defs say it is worth the money, and the rating!

Super fun co-op game! I like the programmable movement in this game. Your building up your program every turn. The game offers some chaos when taking damage so it is a challenge to make sure your robot does something useful. Having a good tactic and roles for the team members helps in clearing the scenarios. The scenario's are very different which keeps the game fresh. The components are way too good for the price, it truly feels like a box of Treasure. Super fun game that I will surely will complete every scenario for sure.

The box of the game is made with tons of love, the figures are awesome, the cards are of very good quality as well. The inlay is really well done, too. 
I really like the setup, mechanics, theme etc. The way that you get wounded by the minions leads to some really funny plays :D if your are lucky a wound can even help you, but mostly you want to avoid getting wounded by the minions. The content is definitely worth the money!
We have finished the ten missions by now and each one was fun to play and nicely designed. Looking forward to playing through the missions again in the master program :D

This was a wonderful gaming experience. Each game is a little different and was able to hold my attention. It was well done thematically; the components are beautiful; the narration was fun. It required a little thinking, but was not one that had us paralyzed trying to make decisions, and is forgiving if you do not make the perfect decision. 

I am NOT a fan of LOL, but still really enjoyed the game and the mechanics. 

By the time my partner and I had played through 2/3 of the campaign, I felt like I had a formula for how to play. I think the campaign was just long enough that I was not bored with it, but had it been much longer I might have gotten bored.

This game looks top-notch! I can't wait to play it. To everyone who thinks it is a tower defense game, I recommend you watch some reviews before you start critiquing the game, because I assure you this isn't League of Legends: the Board Game.

RATING: 8.5
We (me and the wife) are primarily hybrid gamers with more tendency towards competitive  medium-heavy euros. So when the game  got hyped, I was impartial as it looked like another cooperative miniatures game. But thanks to rahdo, I found out it is very much a euro with programming mechanics (I do not have any except Colt Express which is bad with 2).

Now we have played it, this is a great game with lotsa love put into it. It is evident in the components, inserts and the gameplay. The game is quite simple, and the mission by mission new rule introduction made it even easier to get into the game. I would have loved a complete rulebook, but how MvM does it is not by any measure a bad decision. The timer for the draft created just enough tension and mitigated the potential AP. 

I would recommend any gamers to get this game, it is a blast to play and the components really bring immersion, the programming gameplay is both strategic and tactical dependent on the damage & schematic cards you have.

Amazing production aside, the game is super fun and well designed.  It's a cooperative where players draft cards to program the movement of their mechs.  Unfortunately, damage cards can mess with the order or can cover up one of your moves and make you do something else.

Incredible. Takes Robo Rally, speeds it up considerably, and makes it cooperative. That alone should tell you whether you'll like this or not. The production values are amazing, and the gameplay is just as great. It really feels like you're playing a video game, as it doesn't feel like a slog at all. Really, the only downside here is that there are only 10 scenarios to play, but I think it would be easy to create your own. This is just an amazing package, and I can't believe I didn't check it out earlier.

Hmmm, a bit overrated and over-hyped.  Yes, it IS fun and I enjoyed myself but if the most impressive thing to me is the insert, you've missed the mark.  

A good, solid, programmed-movement co-op game that uses a small amount of drafting.  Worth a try but keep our expectations in check.  This isn't the 'be all and end all' of co-op boardgames.

Got it shortly before NYE, asked/convinced four people to join me for the tutorial. Intention was to have more people know the basics, to make it easier later on to assemble a gaming group. However, this kind of backfired - no one wanted to leave after the tutorial...
So we played the first three missions with five people (two sharing a character). Was great fun, everybody loved both the quality / attention to detail and the gameplay.
I've yet to play it with two people, looking forward to this! Might upgrade to a ten then.

MvM introduced me to two things this year, programmable movement and games with nuclear levels of hype.  MvM delivers on both fronts as it was an easy to learn and very fun game which looks excellent sprawled out on the table.  The learning curve is designed right into the missions in the game, so you are up and running quickly, but gaining complexity as you dig deeper.  The price point for what you get is amazing and is a worthwhile pick up for anyone interested in the theme or mechanisms.

A truly incredible thing that entices you constantly with unequaled components, legacy-esque hidden gems, and engrossing gameplay composed of a unique mix of mechanisms and genres. It is in a tier of it's own by many measures and unbeatable quality overall for the price paid. This makes the game very difficult to rate, because nothing like it will probably ever come around to unseat it, and it is unnatural to be as unparalleled as it is. For all that however, I have no doubt that I will keep it forever.

The production value on this is through the roof. From quality miniatures, to markings on the packaging indicating where everything goes, to the radio play files to go along with the game.

The gameplay is excellent as well. It is easy to understand, flows well, and is fun to play. Played the 1st mission and constantly felt like we were going to lose with the bomb going to be overrun, but we managed to pull it off with an excellent card draw at the end.

The game underneath the amazing components is really solid. Most games come down to creatively problem solving when damage cards destroy your perfect command line. I really value the timer as it prevents alpha gaming which is often a problem with co-op games. Might be tuned too easy? Nine games in with three different groups I have yet to lose.

Components: When the box arrived on Saturday, I was surprised by the weight of the game. I mean I know it would come in a big box based the images during my research, the size and the weight are more substantial than I imagined. The miniatures are definitely high quality. Everything inside the box definitely makes you feel that $75 is a steal for this game. 

Gameplay: the game is super easy to play. There are literally 6 steps that a player has to repeat for each round. In addition, the rule book is easy to follow. It incrementally increases the difficulty as you get deeper into the campaign. 

 Replayability: so far, I have only completed mission 1. Although the setup for each mission is the same, the randomness of the card will definitely make the game fresh again next time around. I will update this as I play more scenarios. 

Huge thumb up. Get this game if you want a fun, gateway into board games with $75 to spare. You won't regret your decision unless you need $75 for foods.

To get it out of the way first: production value is amazing! 
Unfortunately normal mode is too easy (haven't lost a single game), hard mode is hit and miss (some missions just are less fun in hard mode). Still, the gameplay is rock solid and MvM has some clever ideas. However, we really struggle to finish the campaign since we don't get much enjoyment from the easy scenarios. I won't play this game ever again after finishing it, there are better programming games out there (Space Alert).

Excellent example where component quality can improve gameplay. The game is quite simple (rules), easy to win and fun (it's so much fun to kill lots of minions in one run).

It's not a 80€ game, but the presentation elevates it to this level and is part of the fun. A more than solid game makes this a Hit and I don't even like programming games. 
A specal Shout Out to the designer of the insert. Making every shape of the Minions fit into every slot of the insert is a stroke of genius and shows the attention to detail, which has made this game as highly rated as it is.

RATING: 8
Played an advance copy. The components are amazing, the minions have a metal gloss on them that makes them really stand out. The characters are all fully painted. Worth every bit of its $75 price tag. The gameplay is on the lighter side, but for a co-op game it doesn't have any quarterbacking because of the timer on card selection and the missions are varied so no one really starts out with intimate knowledge of what will come next... and the boards are big enough where a player can take their mech on a little quest of his/her own and take out minions to level the team. I never played League of Legends so I can't really say how it stacks up against that game, but I can tell you it is a lot of fun if you can get a 4 person group together to play.

It has been said many times, but the production value is really incredible. It is more "deluxe" than all the deluxe games I know of. And the price is ridiculously low for all the components it includes.

The game rules are really simple. They provide a framework the scenarios use to create very different experiences very easily. It's a cooperative game really fun that needs some joint planning and execution to get things done (at least in some missions) but has almost no leader effect.

Now, this kind of games use to have long setup times and boring administration phases with moving pieces and counters. But the designing expertise is also noticed in this area, since the brilliantly designed insert shortens the setup considerably, and there are several mechanisms that make managing the administration phases easier and faster.

Want to play more and could adjust rating a notch higher even after more games.

[b]Mechs vs. Minions[/b] was traded away for Frogriders + $ 2/17/18.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Typically not a game that would be on my radar, but when I saw the actual game I knew my kids would love it so I jumped in on the second printing. Even though I knew what I was getting when I received the game, I couldn't get over how big the box was. Upon opening it I was blown away by the components, pictures don't do this game justice. While the production quality was outstanding, especially at an insanely inexpensive price point, I was a bit nervous that the game play wouldn't support such lavish components.

We were halfway through the tutorial and I was getting nervous that Mechs vs. Minions was going to be a flop. The game was dragging on without us accomplishing much. Then everything started to click as we began to figure out how to program our mechs. Game play is quite straight forward; each round begins with a draft and then you program the card(s) into your mech and run the program. Cards can stack in each slot making the ability of the top card even stronger. The more we played, the more we realized there is a lot more thought required to  program your mech effectively. The game plays smoothly as swarms of minions crowd the board; we've found the missions we've played so far to be quite challenging [i](we're playing with 3 players)[/i]. 

Mechs vs. Minions is definitely an anomaly in our Euro-centric collection, but it's been fun playing a game rich with story and such beautiful components. If you play the game make sure to go to the League of Legends website and listen to the radioplay for each mission. They have voice actors for all the characters performing short bits for each mission. Most missions have 3 or 4 story parts which are extremely well done and adds a lot to the experience.[/i]

Cooperative
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative campaign-based game based around RoboRally-like programmed movement.  Before each turn of the game, players cooperatively draft movement/attack cards and place them in one of the slots on their player board.  Then, players execute those cards in order.  Similar cards can be stacked to provide special advantages, and damage taken can cause players to be forced to place cards with negative (or random) effects in their tableau.  In this way, players' abilities keeps changing as the scenario develops.  Scenarios themselves are goal-based, which players having to achieve a specific objective before they get overrun by minions.  These minions (who are controlled by AI) are easily killed, but come at the players in such quantity that they're difficult to deal with.  I'm usually not a fan of cooperative games, but I really enjoyed this one.  I liked how players could work together and develop specialties in order to accomplish objectives that seem really difficult on first blush.

Today ive received my copy of Mechs vs. Minions.... And the components are just AWESOME!!!!! I cant tell you, how much im flashed...... 75 Euros for such a game is nothing... If the gameplay is just half as good as the components this will be a blast to play...... Cant wait to put this on the table!!!!!

Ok after the first scenarios: this game is awesome. real fun programming your mech and smack down all the minions. we are not at the half of the campaign, but seems each mission is pretty unique. only problem is the aspect that it seems there is a farming aspect at the beginning of each mission, where you try to get your mechs programmed and get the overdrive... so ill rate a little down to 9. but overall this game is just worth a try!

This game caused quite a stir when video game company Riot announced it. They decided to sell it only direct to customers (no distributors; no retail) and they certainly appear to have passed the entire saving onto the buyer: you get a big box with a helluva lot in it for your $75, and with only a $5 charge for delivery. Production values and packaging are outstanding, and the main character 'minis' actually come fully painted. What's more, orders were delivered within a week. This really does set a new paradigm that other games companies will struggle to match.

My copy is 1282/30000 (First Wave).

All the rage! co-op miniatures game with programming. Turned out to be a joy to play, even if a bit long. I quite enjoyed our play with just 3 of us playing. This is a cool game since it is evolving as you play it. You don't have to think of it as a legacy game since you can easily go back and replay any level you want. Just different scenarios. I think it is highly playable and fun times. If the box wasn't so damn huge, I might pick it up. Perhaps one day I will get it by some means. For now I can play Riley's copy.

Only have played this one 2 players so far, but we've enjoyed it a lot.  The programming isn't so inflexible that it becomes annoying rather it gives a lot of flexibility with how many slots on your board you have.  In some cases taking damage causes unexpected beneficial things to happen.  I wish the game box wasn't so large!

You have to first talk about the production - just Amazing!

As others have said the content is unbelievable for $75

Gameplay is solid.

Mechanics are fun and simple and Riot games gets extra credit for the learn more as you go scenarios.  

Not a fan of programming games yet I still enjoy this.  

Only concern is re-playability over time, however, all plays have been fun to date.  

Would probably be a 7 or so ranking if not for the excellent production.

Co-op, action programming, League of Legends inspired. While expensive, everyone gets what amounts to a collectors edition; high production value: loads of minis, art, boards, etc. 10 Scenarios.
-Price/availability concerns, but a great value considering the contents. Huge box (a 'like-to have'  based on current cost)

RATING: 9
This is an incredibly fun fully co-op game. Each player gets an action board with 6 empty slots for cards. Each round you get a card and place it into one of the slots. The card has a type of movement on it, and an effect. If you place a card on top of a card of the same type, the effect of the top card is amplified. Then you resolve your slots from 1-6 and your figure on the board walks around mashing monsters in the way you programed it to do. Then the monsters get to move and attack. Taking damage means you flip cards that will mess up your programing in some way. Sometimes they cover an action slot, sometimes they swap action slots, sometimes they cause an ongoing effect to happen. You can repair damage by discarding a card during the draft rather than program it. The combat is completely diceless, which is fantastic. For a game with this much pageantry, there is surprisingly little randomness. The level ends when you complete or fail your objective, which varies scenario to scenario. 

Another fantastic element is that the game doesn't have a steep learning curve, as of the cards you draft, there are only 8 different cards, 2 of each color. It really allows you to focus in on the fun puzzle of figuring out how and where you will move and attack on your turn.

A solid co-op programming game. I like the way that the different characters develop differently over the course of the game, and the different roles they can play in achieving whatever the objective is for that game. The AI is pretty straightforward, and the gameplay gives some good options without being too complicated. The co-op nature of the game makes the programming less chaotic than competitive games like Robo Rally, but I still don't like it as a mechanic. It's an effective way to restrict the player's options and force tough decisions, but I just find it to be an unsatisfying and even annoying puzzle to deal with as I'm playing.

Good game. A bit long and definitely overproduced for what it is. The rules aren't that streamlined so the complexity to depth ratio is a bit low. That said, I love minis.

UPDATE: Realized what I don't like about the game. It's about logistics and being detail oriented in your planning. I don't like that. That's why I don't like pandemic either. You need to know what your cards can do and what you can kill and know how the minions move. But there's no real outwitting, outthinking, being clever, or discovery involved. Yes you get more powerful, but there's no moment where you're like "I just don't understand how it's possible to win this..." and then "OOOOHHHHH I get it now." There's no moment like that in the game. If you lose, it's like "It's because I didn't pay attention to this." That's it. So... lowering my score because of that.

Played three games, so far, training session, and the first two packets opened and played through. Fun! One of the best cooperative games I have played. I have some concerns about long-term replay value. It's the type of game I could see putting on a shelf after running through all of the scenarios and not playing again for a long time. Could this game become a '9'? Perhaps. But, I think it's likely to stay at an 8.

The box and components are beyond fantastic.  I feel like a kid at christmas every time it gets opened.

So far I've played through the first few missions.  It's been fun, but nothing to write home about. It's all a bit too vapid. However it's also very charming, and I can see where there's room for added complexity to be introduced later on as we delve through the campaign.

Edit:  I keep finding new secrets hidden away in what I had thought to be a completely explored box!   The ability for this game to keep pleasantly surprising me is is more than enough to raise my rating.

Very fun, highly recommended.  The components are of high quality, the box insert is actually useful, so I don't feel the need to buy a custom insert.

1st mission: 8. It was fun, but very hard to judge replay-ability, nor depth properly, as we barely grasped what cards do and how programs can be run at this stage. I can tell that this is a great "introduce-me-to-boardgames" game and will come in handy. Another great thing - i have only played Lords of xidit as a programming game, and I do not find these types of games satisfying (you either celebrate that you screw over a player, or hate someone), but this one is really nice.

[[8] 2nd replay missions 1-2. Quite satisfying. We managed to have fun building specialized machines for particular tasks.

RATING: 5.5
I'm not a huge coop guy - but I quite like this.
I suspect the components affect my rating for this game. But man, are those components beautiful!

The only problem is that you don't do a whole lot in the game other than choosing one or two cards.

EDIT: Rating dropped to 6.5 after a few more plays. While the game is definitely great to look at, it doesn't offer much depth.

EDIT: After a pretty long scenario (Scenario 5 I believe) I decreased the score to 5.5
It has become evident that in reality you barely have any decisions to make. A game might play 45 minutes over 10 rounds - during this timespan your only options is in choosing which card to take, which is rarely a tough decision, and not at all too exciting. Had it not been for the components I'd probably rate this even lower.

Brilliant game, especially for me and my family (my 7 year old says it’s the best).

Miniatures and rest of components are very high quality and the box is very well designed.

Rules and rule texts can on occasion be lacking, but other than that this game is a must if you don’t mind the cost (75 euros from Riot Games direct).

Good additional content available from its own website, helps with replayability.

RATING: 8.5
Production value can go a long way.  This game is fun and I'm very happy with how well developed it is.  The game has personality and you want these characters to triumph.

This is the only programming game I've played and I was pleasantly surprised.  It seems that a competitive programming game could get frustrating - when other people's programs interfere...yikes!  In this case it's fun to see the mechs bump into each other.  It turns into a lighthearted humor fest.

It's also very easy to teach, learn and play.  The objectives keep it challenging, not the rules or other fiddly bits.  I highly recommend this game.

Positives:
 - Very easy to learn and play: The tutorial and rule book are easy to read and understand.  Thanks to Rodney's FAQ I haven't run into any questions that have gone unanswered.
 - Production value is stellar: It's so beautiful.  Regardless of how good a game is, playing with beautiful pieces and high quality components goes a long way.
 - Personality:  It's funny and full of personality.  The illustrations are cute and each character has a unique personality that you'll experience throughout the game.
 - Replay Value: Although there are currently only 10 missions, the frequency of the minions spawning, and the fact that you probably won't be able to build your action set the same in any two given games, there will be no shortage of replay value.  A scenario will play out differently each time.

Negatives:
 - Play Time: Due to the way you build your actions, sometimes things may get a bit lengthy.  You can find yourself going in circles for a bit.  You are able to upgrade your actions as the game goes on, which will fix your movement.  My wife was getting a little frustrated when she couldn't establish a meaningful movement set.  I believe this is something that will improve with experience.  The first mission took about 90 minutes with 2 players.  I believe that could have been 45 minutes had we gotten our action set optimized sooner.

Fun and quick cooperative game, which is perfect, if you just want to blow up stuff and hack through waves of enemies. Still the mechanics are not to simple, so that you have to think quite a bit, but it is  also more rewarding this way.

I really enjoyed playing this game when I got it but after a couple of missions we figured that once you knew how to win a mission the game was not that hard. I did finally get this one finished and played all 10 missions but I am not sure how fast I will get this back out to play. If there are others that want to play this game I will get it out but I will leave all of the planning to them as since I have won every mission I am sure that I will be able to plan and win these missions. But I am more then willing to play in a supporting role. This is why my rating dropped from a 8 to a 7. For me the replay ability is really not there. For me and my group that played this game through completion have no desire to play it again anytime soon unless it is with new players.

RATING: 8
Have played first 3 missions with wife & 7 year-old son.  We incorporate the radio-plays in our set up and post-mission reset/tear-down.  Very beautiful game.  Interesting decisions.  We usually leave the timer out, but our pre-draft discussion is quite long, so we already know what we're looking for.

Mission 3 took 1.5 hours from taking the box off the shelf to putting it back, which is perfect for this season of our lives.

It's a good game and I enjoy playing it.  Easily the best-produced game I own.  It's interesting to figure out what you want to do in the overall context of the mission and what you want your individual mech to do on the upcoming turn and what you need to get there.  And it's funny when you make a mistake and your mech shoots flame at nowhere or just bumps into the corner for the whole turn.

I love playing with my family, but might choose something else if playing with my buddies.  Having said that, I'd very happily play it every time if someone else wanted to.

I love this game!!! Amazing componets and quality. Everything has been taken with so many care that puts the rest of the games I have played before in a step backwards. The concept is really simple but the idea of introducing new components, rules, ways to play scenario after scenario is really intelligent and generates a high hype. 

I've played a lot with two players and the key of success remains in talking a lot and planning every program line before drawing the cards. 

A great thumb from me!!!

The inability to control your mechs when damaged is really cute and fun at the beginning of a mission, but can cause a mission to really drag. 

First few missions with my kids really started to drag on and on.  The overdrive mechanism seems kind of like a band-aid where by if you play a mission for an incredibly long time, it simply allows you to immediately win.  

Very beautiful production, and many aspects of the game are quite polished.

I liked the game back when it was WZD, and now it is cleaned up and enriched.  It's a solid core even without the variety of missions, and the missions and glitz just add to the experience.  The gimmick of nice parts and multiple scenarios doesn't carry a game for me, but it's welcome icing on a strong underlying engine...which this game has!

My rating may drop a bit depending on how replayable the missions are, but it may not if it proves easy to make custom scenarios that are also fun to play (or if there is a good team vs. team mode).

My only criticism of the game thus far is that there is no Teemo.

Based on production quality, THIS IS THE BEST BOARD GAME I HAVE IN MY COLLECTION. It´s awesome!! I had seen many videos online and read many reviews about "MvsM", but when you have it in your hands, when you open it, when you see and take in your hands all its components, the extreme level of detail in its production design and quality that everything has... It´s something spectacular, sublime, and extraordinary!! Many thanks to Riot Games for making a board game such as this one! Congratulations for this great work of art! I never had not been so excited about a board game since I got a copy of "Space Hulk" (and, IMHO, "MvsM" is much better than "SH" in relation between quality production/price). I still don´t believe that "MvsM" has the price that it has. It´s incredible!! AMAZING!!!! :-O  And the game itself is a good programming game! I'm back to being a happy child! Excellent game! I hope Riot Games will produce more board games like this one in the future.

One of the finest-looking games I've seen. The aesthetic is dripping off the board, here. MvM is cooperative and not difficult to play or learn, but can test the team with some great challenges. Program your decks and think moves ahead to accomplish an assortment of missions as you play through different scenarios. Good for people who love a great-looking coop game and like theme. Not so great for people who have limited closet space; this game box is large and will not earn points with your wife when you tell her it's the new coffee table decoration.

I've only played through the tutorial scenario and the first mission playing solo so far, but overall I've found it pretty fun.  I really like the card powers and how you can stack cards of the same elements to get a stronger power, but sometimes I'd get stuck in a useless program and it would feel like there wasn't quite enough I could do to alter it fast enough, leaving multiple turns where I couldn't protect things that really needed protecting, and that felt frustrating and seemed to drag the game out longer than I wanted.

There seems to be only one type of minion (along with some sort of boss eventually), although it appears that they'll have somewhat different behaviors per scenario. I do like that their behavior is kept really simple, but it almost boils down to them being little more than targets or obstacles that force you to draw damage cards if they are right next to you, and not really feeling like they're enemies at all. I'm not sure I like that you can kill a bunch and then they can spawn right next to you and damage you anyway, but at least the damage cards seem to not eliminate anyone, just screw up your programming.

I also don't like having to break seals on the mission envelopes. I would have much preferred the envelopes were unsealed. It feels like I have destroyed the game somehow and reduced its value by doing that, and this isn't a legacy game so to me it doesn't feel like you should be forced to tear things open. But that's more a personal preference I guess.

Overall I enjoyed the game, I didn't find it 'too easy' like several people I've talked to have said, and I'm glad I chose this to be the big box miniatures game I get over a bunch of other dungeon crawlers with samey dice rolling mechanics. This is clearly heavily influenced by Robo Rally, but it brings enough fresh ideas to that style of gameplay that it's worth checking out.

Pretty fun programming game.  As you'll read everywhere, it's production values are off the charts.  The minions are pretty fiddly (moving dozens at a time, spawning dozens at a time, and remembering if you moved that one, or attacked with it, or not yet... It gets messy).  
It's a shelf and table hog.

It turns out Robo Rally is a lot more fun when it doesn't limit players' choices and is also a co-op. 

Enough has already been said about the amazing component quality, but the game itself is a wonderfully fun programmed movement game that is also simple enough to serve as a gateway game. The campaign slowly adds complexity so as not to overwhelm.

A gem in a genre I don't usually enjoy.

After running through the tutorial and the first scenario, this has fired RoboRally completely for me. That wasn't hard to do, since RoboRally just takes too dang long. But this is so much more thematic and flavorful! Watching your mech get stronger as you level up and combo is really fun. Ten scenarios seems like so few, but I'll probably still pick this up--especially since my son, after playing that first scenario, said, "Dad, you have GOT to get this game!"

Pros:
- components outstanding
- plans that work feel very rewarding sometimes
- can be quite tense
- made us play robo rally instead
- made me pretty resistant against hype

Cons:
- very light
- repetetive (especially because it's far too long)
- elements of luck/chaos are more often tedious instead of fun
- slapped on legacy envelopes without story

RoboRally variants showed that there is great appetite for 2v2 capture-the-flag team-play hilarity, and that would've fit beautifully with the League of Legends theme, with 2v2 up to 5v5 and minions on each side providing fodder. A completely missed opportunity here, where I'm left wondering what could've been. The gameplay is more refined, but AI is so simplistic that a player could really solo this, absent a few contrived timed situations, and action sequencing just does not fit with a cooperative game. No true coordination here.

Components are splendid, and they add much to the pleasure.
I played Roborally, and after 2 games, I hated so much the game, both because the ugliness of the overall parts, and because it felt quite old.
MvM is not that original game concerning mechanics, but it works smoothly, and it looks like "well done, bro".
Enjoy very much the building story and comicity, about these fellows Mechs

Arrived with some box damage and a cracked mech tray.  Riot would not replace the tray and only offered a $5 discount. Each email I sent took a week before I got a response. After over a month with no resolution, I returned the game and called my CC company to reverse the charges. Normally I would not care about a tray but the custom trays are one of the main components in this game. I know several others who also had cracked trays. I would have been happy had they replaced the tray, replaced the entire game promptly, or offered a more sizable discount. The terrible customer service just ruined the game.  Just seeing it stirs up bad feelings and I don't think I could ever enjoy this game.

My first game ended too soon - I feel like I didn't get the chance to see what my mech was really capable of. The programming system of this game is incredibly puzzley and fun, and it really does feel like you're building up your mech into a crazy death machine. This game may actually be a 10, but I'll wait until I play it some more.

RATING: 10
Wow! The production value in this game is ridiculous and for the price point I am truly blown away. You could not cram any more into the behemoth of a box if you tried. It sits atop my game shelf as the new overlord of my collection!

Sometimes though, amazing looking games often disappoint with lackluster gameplay but this is not the case here.

A unique engine builder, that while simple at its core, just works extremely well. I'm addicted and can't get enough of playing this one. Every game is different as your program and strategy changes from game to game. It plays well at all player counts and is just a breath of fresh air in my collection.

I've played with both experienced gamers as well as noobs and both groups loved it.

You can tell that his game had a lot of love put into it. While corners could have been cut very easily, the publisher spared no expense to provide a truly amazing, insanely over produced, in the best way, experience that I guarantee will never be replaced in my collection.

P.S. The minion trays - ridiculous - universal slots that fit all three molds of minions. Such a simple concept but so amazing when you have to pack 100+ minions back in the box. I tip my hat Riot Games!

Awesome game! So thematic and funny! You think you programmed your mech as you should. Then minions move, you get hit by one and your whole program is ripped into pieces. You begin to repair, to rewrite your digital orders and change from despair to happyness. 

The more you play, more difficult the missions become and the puzzles to solve get more complicated. Great you dont have to begin with the most complex rules. The tutorial missions introduce you step by step to the mechanisms of the game.

I ordered mechs vs minions in the first 30 minutes after launch. It really was worth the effort!

edit: after having finished all missions i still like the game, but the management of all the moving pieces during the minions and boss phase bothers me a bit, especially compared to the fact that the decisionmaking is rather light.

Very glad I bought this game, I bought it being a big fan of League of Legends and feeling confident in their ability enough that.. hey their board game should be great too.

It's not what I expected actually but was very pleasantly surprised. I've recently been enjoying the simpler games, and games that are co-op. This reminds me of Pandemic in the way that the group will get together and be planning the entire groups moves all together, except that with Mechs Vs. Minions you feel a stronger attachment towards your character and your turn than in Pandemic.

Haven't finished the game yet as don't really have people to play with much, but really want to play it.... right now!

This is a great game for what it is, a goofy romp. First, yes, the bits are pretty great. Lots of little minions for dying, 3 painted mechs, one giant boss, good quality cards, great quality boards. I've seen better minis but at this price you can't beat the value.
The game itself is a fairly well designed "you program your guys and kill kill oops we screwed up there" kind of game. If you don't like goofy, you won't like this. If you're expecting brilliant, this is quite that. It's pretty, it's fun, what more can you ask?
-- One quibble: The rules could be better written. For such a simple game, it's a annoying that some odd edge cases aren't more clearly explained. Minor point, but it does deserve a mention.

We planned on playing the Tutorial and the first scenario and then move on to other games this weekend, but the game was so fun that we played multiple scenarios all evening. 

The game seems costly but it is worth it. The components are very high quality, and the game is very easy to learn and really, really fun to play. The box is crazy huge and it is a bit difficult to get to some of the components during play, but it's not too terrible, especially if you have extra room on the table. 

While the scenarios are sealed and you can only experience the fun of discovering them once, they can be played multiple times and I think they would still be fun. There are even easy mode versions of each scenario, which I think would make it easier to play with younger players. Excellent game!

This is just wow... I will not mention the components. 

From a game-play perspective alone: it is a 10... I love coop games, I ABSOLUTELY love programming games, so this was a no brainier buy. Some of the things which make this game stand out, (up to mission 5 right now, I have played them multiple times each, so lets say 10 plays in total).
It has a pseudo legacy mechanic, which relies on nice (and not so nice) surprises, new mission mechanics, and does not require you to physically spoil the game. Which is great!! This makes it repayable, unlike any other legacy game. The actual gameplay is so much fun, card drafting, programming, upgrading, and team work all in one! There have been down to the wire wins that had my friends and I on our feet as we were executing our last round commands, and having everything just fall right into place... Sorry. I really like this game...

Pros
- Component quality it the best I've seen in any game, very colorful with great art
- Inexpensive for the component quality
- 10 campaign missions are fun to go through and new discoveries and unlocks are always interesting
- Gameplay is fun and often hilarious when things don't go the way you planned

Cons
- The strategy for each mission can often be the same - hold off enemies in one spot until you level up and can complete the objective
- A few missions are same-y and uninspired

My wife and I had a blast playing through this game. Each night we couldn't wait to get it out and play another mission. It loses a little bit of replayability going back through the missions again, but even the one time through was well worth the money.

The game was rather entertaining for 70 minutes. Then it start suffering from the typical pit holes of co-op games. I just wanted to scream "dude, make a move!" all of the "should I do this, should I do that?" turns muddles the speed of the game. But hey, I dont like co-ops because they are single player games. 

I'll wait for someone to sell me this game used for about $20-30 bucks. I'll play it with my young cousins.

One of the best co-op experiences there is, as long as you enjoy programmed movement.

The production quality is through the roof. Best in the industry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
First of all this was a big impulse buy on my part because I used to be a huge League of Legends player.  I thought for sure that the game would be a bad cash in on a popular property and at the price tag of $70 that the huge number of included miniatures would be cheap crap.

I don't know how they did it but I have to address the components first.  They are incredible.  Thick colorful cardboard mats and cards with nice art.  Metal trackers and thick plastic crystals.  Colorful well-written rulebooks and story progression system with a ton of new missions to unlock and a TON of good quality plastic miniatures.  The playable characters are even painted!  I don't know how they can sell this for $75 and not be losing money.  Hell, I don't know how they would be able to sell this for $120 and not be losing money.  If nothing else they impress with the quality on offer here.

So how is the game?  It is a cooperative programmed movement game.  I've always liked the concept of programmed movement but have never found a game that really hits the nail on the head for me before now.  Robo Rally always seems to take way too long.  The amount lost due to failure or mistakes in Red Alert really turned me off.  This one though seems to get it right though I haven't progressed very far into the missions yet.

In this game players draft movement, turning, and attacking abilities and achieve goals based on the mission at hand which changes from game to game.  I'm not going to spoil anything but one core thing is there are always a bunch of minions that need killin'.  So you move, turn and kill them using different cards.  It's cooperative and for the most part players can't hurt each other (so far, the rules change with ever new mission unlocked).  I did find the early missions very easy.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Maybe it's just that I loved looking at the pieces and wiping out hordes of minions was just fun but steam rolling through them wasn't as bad as I expected.  Normally I need more challenge and I have no doubt that will be on offer in later missions.

All in all I have nothing bad to say about this game.

I don't normally love cooperative games or programming games, but for some reason, the two go really well together here.

(This rating is based on my first play) I was watching this game being played befor eI got my chance to play it and my initial impression was not good.  I was pretty determined that I was not going to like it, but decided to be fair and actually try it.  Glad I did as I found the gameplay to be more fun than I had thought from my observations.  The game was actually quite a lot of fun. and I would certainly play it again, but I do not think that this is a game that I would be rushing to buy as I think I would find it too hard to get to the table often enough to justify me buying it.

Just oozes quality. To quote John Hammond, "Spare no expense." I'm not sure if Riot Games even makes any money off of this game, for $75. However, they sure have generated some good will from boardgamers, me included. That's just talking about the aesthetics. The gameplay itself is teriffic as well. Tense and engaging. Way to go Riot Games, this is quite possibly the best freshman offering I've ever seen.

The models are great. 

The gameplay leaves much to be desired. Not for the heavy gamer. The game play relies on drafting cards to "program" your character to move about and attack things.  But there is not much depth to this and the strategy can be mastered in one sitting.  

Great art, great miniatures, just not enough technical difficulty to keep me interested.

Cooperative Roborally where you draft cards with special abilities and move around the maps crushing minions and trying to complete objectives.

I tried to avoid this game.  I waited.  And waited.  I thought it was sold out (or so people said).  But, it was still showing available on the site.  So, I waited some more hoping it would sell out and I'd have missed the opportunity to buy it this time around...

But, I caved in.  And the day after I submitted my order, the site listed it as not available anymore! :o

I need to reiterate what many have said before me: "WOW". Opening the game is awe inspiring and I am also a miniatures gamer in addition to board gamer. The 4 painted heroes and washed minions are great (I have not opened the boss box yet) and the build in storage is amazing: this is what CMON needs to do with their games, especially how all the poses of minions can fit in all the spaces; real design thinking!

I have just played through the tutorial to learn the game before playing with the family, and well done Riot Games; you have done what video game tutorials have for computer games and transferred that to a board game. At the end I went to open the next envelop so I could "be ready" for the first real mission with my family but it was sealed shut and decided to save the opening and reading with them for the first time.

I was very fired up to play MvM as it combines several of my favorite mechanisms - coop, realtime, and programming.  The components are obviously stellar, and so far the game play has been good.  I've only had a chance to play the first mission, which felt a bit simple and easy, but I'm looking forward to exploring more.

The biggest negative for me is definitely the box size.  It takes up the space of 3 other games, and is too big to fit in any of my bags that I normally bring to game night.  I fear that the large box size will cause me to sell the game after I've played through all of the missions.

UPDATE 1 year and 5 plays later: MvM checked all of the boxes of what I look for in a game, but it has since fallen a bit flat and I'm not entirely sure why.  I think the problem is that the drafting part is too slow.  At least in 4 player, you are only adding one card to your program each turn.  There are just too many turns where you aren't doing anything exciting.  Even later in the game, especially if you have taken damage, there is a good chance that your mech will be totally useless.

I sold my copy while the buzz was still hot.  My buddy still has his and I'll probably play it again just to see what the rest of the missions are like.  But if I never got a chance to play it again, that wouldn't bother me one bit.

What was my surprise to learn that Riot Games known for videogames are working on a board game and that the hype is constantly building around it. After reading articles and previews and watching videos about the game I decided to buy it and see. If it's not good I'll just sell it. Yep, I kept it and am very glad I decided to add it to my collection.

This game is pure fun. Easy to teach with simple rules, single mission or campaign play and lots of beautiful peaces. Production value here is tremendous - from very nice prepainted or shaded miniatures to a great insert. Thanks to games like this one I started to really like programming games.

While I was hopeful for this game, I have to say that so far it has been quite surprising. While it may not be a perfect game, the components are amazing and the game play has been quite fun. It takes away a lot of the annoying bits about co-op games because of the programming, it would be hard no matter how alpha the play for them to dictate other peoples moves. The way the "story" such as it is unfolds is fun as well as each packet adds a few cards.

Really an excellent game so far (not done with the campaign yet). Feels like a coop legacy version of [thing=18] [/thing]. Only coop programming game I know of. The sealed envelopes with missions and upgrades for the game are an interesting legacy style twist. The hordes of mindless wandering and attacking minions remind me of the Lemmings in the computer game of the same name - except here you must kill them.

RATING: 8
A lot has been said about the production quality and the price. Those are indeed great. But for me the presentation really stands out.

Learning this game is just a delight. The tutorial is presented in the style of a video game tutorial. You start working toward a goal, learning the mechanics, but as you meet certain objectives you trigger events that cause you to turn the page and learn more new mechanics. Along the way in the manual there are little boxes off to the side where the characters give tips about the game. It works great and it really brings you into the game world.

There's also the "legacy" aspect where you open new missions and usually get some new cards to add to the game. Each mission has its own manual, so you don't have to flip through a huge book of missions to find the right one. This is a really nice touch.

The gameplay itself is good. There's a very simple system where you draft cards, play those cards onto your personal board, then each player executes their cards in order. After that, there is an enemy turn where enemies move, spawn, then attack. You just keep doing all of that over and over until you win or lose. The simplicity of the system is great because you can easily explain the game in just a few minutes.

The thing I really like is powering up your cards. As you play multiple cards of the same type you get stronger abilities. Eventually you might kill six or seven minions in one go, or maybe you move all the way across the board to get into a good position. This feels really good after your initial clumsy movement and low-powered attacks. Also, once you have some schematic cards the mechs really start to feel different. One specializes in controlling the damage he receives. One can kill a ton of minions easily. Each mech starts to feel a lot more different than I initially thought.

Overall it's great so far, I just want to see how the different missions play out to see how the gameplay holds up.

Update: Played through Mission 3 now and the game is still great, with Mission 3 being my favorite so far. If the missions continue to get better from here my rating could go up.

Only a couple of potential issues so far: if you get very unlucky while fighting the boss the game could end in three rounds with an instant loss. The likeliness of this actually happening is pretty low, but it would be frustrating nonetheless.
Also, it seems like the game is meant for four players. Mission 2 would be incredibly difficult with fewer players because you need players to go out and get objectives while somebody else stays near the base to clean up minions. I've only played with three and four players, and I don't see the game working with two.

This game is so. much. FUN. It's silly, zany, and crazy. You'll repeatedly run into the wall and fire in the wrong direction, but it's an absolute blast!

Wanted to get it forever and managed to get it used at a bazaar recently. Honestly, I've been trying to figure out why on earth they'd want to get rid of it since I can't imagine ever not wanting to play. This is one of those rare games where it permeates my dreams and I -still- can't wait to get it back to the table. Solid components, solid design. (10-20-17)

Programming games are solely missing in my collection and a cooperative and soloable programming game sounds fun. The tutorial gives a nice intro feel and is good at teaching stuff to players. The first tutorial play was hilarious, as stuff went wrong from the get-go and one of the yordles just didn't provide a lot to the fight. Fun and super cute! Programming is quite chaotic, though, since you never get stuff in a way to make solid plans. You really have to build up something and try to survive with that with small variations - and make do with what you get.

I ticked own, but officially it was a present for a friend.

As it stands we're about to start mission 4, and the game is immensely fun, very hectic, but not too tough, in that we can generally complete any mission in a single sitting (we made a cock up on number 2 and assumed charging full steam ahead would be a good idea... it wasn't).

Very tactical, very fun, and the fact you never know what the next mission will contain until you start is a great twist.

Only negative is one of the mechs broke on the first day of it being opened (the one with the green head on the front of the mech had the green head fall off). We contacted the company and a replacement is already on its way to us. So also cracking customer service as well.

One of the best games I've ever played for several reasons:
1) Attention to detail: I've never seen such a well thought out product, from the glamorous components to the perfect box insert. You can really tell the game designers and developers wanted to create the best game they possibly could. (SPOILER ALERT they did)
2) Gameplay: the game is simple to pick up but not so easy to master, especially since each scenario will require a different approach. I've made bad programming choices that lost the game.
3) Scenarios: Each scenario feels and plays differently, making this more a collection of games than a single game. The best part is the minion AI: it's different in each scenario, but it's very easy to manage; there will be no searching the rulebook for obscure priorities.

Note: Played all missions

This game is more than the sum of its parts.
On paper it doesn't seam like it would be that interesting, hover once you play it, it's incredibly fun.

Although it is a bit overproduced, and setting it up is a pain, once you get it on the table, it's there to stay.

The sleeved scenarios and Radioplay recordings(from MvM website) add a lot to the atmosphere/enjoyment of the game.

Even after playing trough all of them, each individual scenario is repayable.

I had a blast playing this, and definitely the most fun game of the year

First Impression:
Fun gameplay coupled with stunning component quality and a strong theme make this a solid thematic experience.

Pros: Strong theme. Excellent toy factor. Short but engaging hand management decisions. Fun programming and damage system. Full of thematic extras (humour, good narrative and memorable characters, audio clips for missions, minor "legacy" elements, variable player powers, "ultra" abilities etc)

Cons: I don't like the theme. I still find some elements funny though.

Overall it is a very fun game. I'd be happy to play again!

Mechs vs Minions is a cooperative game where players are trying to complete various missions. I've only played the one so far, but I'd imagine they're mostly "move your guys around and kill minions" type of scenarios.

There's a public drafting round where you add abilities to your program line. Stacking multiple cards of the same type allows you to access the upgraded abilities of that card. Then in turn order you execute your program line from left to right and do whatever it says to do. During the game you might take damage in which case, some random penalty card is drawn, you do the effect and then you slot the card into your program line wherever it tells you. From that point on (unless you spend your draft phase fixing the problem) you're stuck with that penalty card in your program line.

The game was a lot of fun. There's potential for tons of random chaos and if you get in trouble it can spiral out of control quickly. The production quality of this game is incredible especially considering the cost.

A game full of challenges that will demand your constant attention to small details. Want to keep winning after mission 3, well you better keep your eyes on the prize and bend every decision around achieving it. Biggest down side? It does not seam to work well with any player count other than four. The double draft at the beginning does not make up for the extra mech on the board.

Very fun game. The game is rather simple to pick up, but can get every hectic very quick, Half the fun is planning out what you want to do in the next couple turns only to have a minion screw everything up and cause your mech to go haywire and out of control.At $75, this game is an amazing package. The quality of all the components sets the bar from here out. The packaging and organization is untouchable.

Love the toy factor of this game (its components are incredible, especially for its retail price), but the gameplay does not do it for me. It lacks excitement and does not feel fresh or original in any way. If I want to play a programming game, I would rather play Kings Of Air & Steam. If I want to play a co-op, I would settle for Defenders Of The Realm. Mechs vs Minions is an inoffensive diversion full of eye candy, but the game itself is too procedural to sparkle. Still, it's entertaining enough to play again if someone asked.

Co-op programmed movement game, like RoboRally or Twin Tin Bots. About as complex as RR overall, but with less program variation from round to round, like TTB.  However, while that makes the choices easier, the overall randomness is not much reduced due to various dice rolls and card flips (often you'll take damage because of a die roll, and get a random damage card that you assign to a random slot due to another die roll, and the effect is to cause you to roll a die on your turns to see what happens). It handles quarterbacking decently by using a timer during the draft, stacking multiple cards of one type for boosted effects is interesting, and it certainly has high production value. On the whole it's fine, but the choices are very light, so keep turns moving at a reasonable pace or it may wear out its welcome.

Played at BGG Con 2016

I'm really struggling to find a fault in this game.  If this is Riots first attempt at breaking into the tabletop scene, I really can't wait to see what they come up with next.  They knocked it out of the park with Mechs vs Minions-- everything down to the insert is expertly done which results in a near perfect player experience.

[b]First, the bad (and there isn't much)[/b]
The only real fault I can find in the game is that it doesn't scale well when you have fewer than four players.  I played with three players and some of the scenarios we played really required four.  They have [i]Easy Mode[/i] but we really didn't like taking that option...which resulted in us dying.  The only scenario this was frustrating in was a scenario where three lines of minions tried to rush our school.  We lost.  Miserably.

This game shouldn't be 2-4 players, it's 4 players.  Just don't play it with anything less.

And not onto the good!

[b]The Insert[/b]
Let me tell you something-- I love a good well thought out insert.  Nothing annoys me more than finishing a brand new game and them trying to put it back into the box only to see it doesn't fit and/or the compartments don't really keep pieces in their place.  Mechs vs Minions has am amazing insert.  You'll easily have 30-40 miniatures on the table after a session which usually results in a long setup/takedown, not with this game.  Everything has its very clear spot so getting a new set of minions is never a chore and placing them back in the insert could not be simpler.

The [i]only[/i] problem with takedown is scenarios will ask you to shuffle new cards into the various decks and after playing through 5-6 missions, finding these cards you shuffled in can be a pain.  This isn't a large problem if you own your own copy, I unfortunately was not playing with my own copy so had to make sure it was properly setup for the next people that played the game.

[b]The Tutorial/Manual[/b]
Nothing drags a game down more for me than an overly lengthy badly written manual.  Mechs vs Minions very wisely split their manual into two books-- a tutorial mission and a glossery of terms.  This means that there is no lengthy explanation of rules, you jump right into the game and it teaches you everything you need to know as you play.  This instantly made my play group excited because I didn't have to talk at them for 20 minutes explaining the game.  I just gave them a brief rundown of the basics and then we started playing.  I wish more games did this.

[b]The Mechs[/b]
Now onto the meat of the game.  The mechs are controlled by programming certain inputs into your command row and these inputs are attacks, turns, and moves.  Each one has specific elements and each one can be upgraded by stacking the same element.  With a small amount of planning it's simple enough to get your mech to do what you want, except it will eventually start getting damaged and your inputs start getting moved, disabled, and swapped.  This results in a really chaotic mix of you wanting to zig but your mech keeps zagging.

This could be really frustrating in other games, but with Mechs vs Minions, there are minions everywhere so you're always killing something so it's always fun.

[b]The Minions[/b]
This game easily has 30 or so miniatures on the board which could result in a drag figuring out what these minions do, but each mission has a really clear and easy setup for how these minions attack and them attacking is as simple as seeing if they're adjacant to anything and drawing a card if they are.  Mechs vs Minions went for a really simple system that keeps players interacting with the game and it was a huge success.

Really, I cannot stress enough how good this game flows.  It gradually introduces mechanics and never gets bogged down in rules, it just plays and plays really well.

[b]The Boss[/b]
Our last mission we played before we had to return the game was one with the boss.  We decided to play on the harder mode which set his HP to 10 instead of 5 and while we lost [i](we got him to 1!!)[/i] we had a great time.  The boss has shields you have to take down before you damage him and the shields return after you damage him. He also has increasingly powerful attack that outright destroy you, except you can't really get destroyed in this game, your mech just gets harder to control.

The result was a hilariously fun boss fight early in a board games mission structure that I will remember for years.  We were having a great time as the giant boss mech scorpioned pulled one player across the map after his mech failed and went the wrong the wrong direction only to do a giant lava axe the next turn.  This boss was brutally difficult, but we had a great time with it even though we lost.  This is the sign of a great boss fight.

[b]Great Co-op[/b]
Some games are co-op but never really forces the co-op nature.  In Mechs vs Minions players have to work together to program their mechs and satisfy the difficult goals.  If one player isn't working with the team, the mission will absolutely fail.  Time is limited when your picking your programs, but the rest of the time the group is constantly communicating.

[b]The Miniatures[/b]
The miniatures in this game are gorgeous.  The boss and player mechs all come fully painted and this isn't some bad factory painting you might see on D&D miniatures, these all look professionally painted.  I really don't know how they managed to produce this game at the quality it's at because those miniatures are gorgeous.  

The game also comes with A LOT of minions and while they aren't painted, they come in many different poses and they are all ink washed which makes them still look very nice.  Again, just superb job that I can't imagine how they actually made.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
If you can't tell, I really liked this game.  Riot swung for the fences and they hit it into the next county.  The few faults I have with this game are small and the positives [i]faaaaaaaaar[/i] outweigh any negative I have.  If you see this game, pick it up immediately.

Fantastic component quality, but the gameplay & theme really doesn't do it for me. Love the programming and timed draft, but the core activity of the missions is kind of repetitive and uninteresting.

Burning down hordes of faceless "minions" just isn't exciting to base a game around. The urgency of "don't let them get to the base" is real, but I feel like it's 2017 and we can come up with something better than masses of identical enemies and a couple objective to move around.

One of the better coop games I've had the pleasure of playing, offering a sort of mix of Robo Rally and card drafting games. The pieces are beautiful, with loads of miniatures, colorful, interesting boards, and painted main character and boss figurines. The game is paced well, introducing mechanics when appropriate, and it features possibly the best game tutorial I've ever encountered. Definitely a worthwhile pickup if you can find a steady group to play the game through.

Wave 1 - Shipment 2 (Eu West).

I'm not enjoying this quite as much as I'd hoped. A bit random for me - and the realtime component is problematic to me. Hard to get to the table as it requires a light mood (preferably after a drink or two), but it sits enormeously on the table.

Rated 9 after playing first 4 missions: This is awesome. Best programming game I've played and first co-op in a long time that I like. A lot of Vlaada-like feel with the humour and flavour in the rulebooks and the game being fun even while your mech is disobeying and doing random unplanned things.

I was going to wait until completing all 10 missions, but after only 4, it's already earned a 9 from me.

The components are as good as the hype, and the gameplay is very good, too.  It really had the potential to be a super fiddly game, but the way everything works together just makes sense and is easy to deal with all the way around.  It's clear that a lot of thought and care went into the development of this game.

Played scenario 1 & 2, loved it. So many pieces! +.5 for component and insert quality.  Might upgrade to a perfect 10 if the later scenarios keep getting better and better, if I even get a chance to play them.

Update: I did play far enough to see the "boss". It's quite cool. I'm happy with the 9.5 currently though. Moving the minions is a bit annoying so I find it hard to rate perfectly... but I do think it's Best-In-Class for programming games... and maybe even for Co-op games.

The amount of stuff in this box is absolutely astonishing, considering it costs around $80 shipped. Of course just because a game is cheap, that doesn't necessarily make it worth having. I can say without a shadow of doubt however, this is worth having. 

It's set up a bit like a legacy game, with new cards, abilities, and maps added to the game every session, as you explore the campaign. Mechanically it functions basically like roborally, so even after you have played through a scenario, it remains fun to go back and do it again, since programing six moves in advance makes for all sorts of wacky and challenging chaos. I like to think of it as replaying a video game. Some of the surprises are gone and you can anticipate the AI's moves, since you have seen it before...but the timing remains tricky and beating a level again still feels satisfying, even the third or fourth time.

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it does feel player count sensitive. The designers claim it works well at any player count, but I don't quite buy it. Trying to defend three vectors of attack with only two characters seems impossible at times, but there are only a couple of scenarios that create this scenario, so it's not a deal breaker.

One last thing. I'm not an insert guy at all and generally, I toss 90 percent of them right in the recycling, but the one in Mech's vs. Minions is an absolute feat of engineering. There are 100 minion miniatures, with four unique sculpts and all are very different. Yet each one fits perfectly into one of the hundred trays and no matter which figure you use in which slot, it still fits. Amazing. Everything else has a place as well and it all stacks together so nicely, you couldn't fit so much as an extra deck of cards into the box, which already takes up half of a table.

Honestly, this is something special.

real fist programmable movement game I have played and I love it! I like that you draft your movement from turn to turn and that you could potentially upgrade your movement or change it completely so its not a big issue.  I also like that damage can affect your movement tableau, its an interesting hurtle that you have to maneuver around.  Amazing game and the component quality is phenomenal right down to the insert that comes with the game.

Worst experience ever trying to purchase a game. And I'm not talking about the abysmal server issue on Day 1. I somehow managed to get through that unholy mess and I was told I successfully had a Wave 1 order being processed. 2 weeks later, they say ALL Wave 1 orders were now shipped, but still no shipping message or anything for me. At their website it still said "order processing" but when I checked PayPal, I discovered the transition had been in a "pending" state for 2 weeks. Riot claimed no responsibility for this (of course) and said I had to settle the issue with PayPal. PayPal, on the other hand, said these kinds of issues are the merchant's fault. When I told Riot about this, they prompted CANCELLED my order, and not once did I ever get an explanation as to why the transaction was stuck in "pending" state. Riot needs to stick to video games because they sure as hell don't know how to sell board games. At least I saved myself $80 on this mess. Here's wishing total failure to Riot games for this nightmare.

Fantastic game which presents enough of a challenge to keep it interesting while still very possible to beat the missions. The gameplay at 2 players vs 4 is very different and each presents a unique experience, especially for certain missions where it feels like 2 people just cannot be everywhere they need to be at once!

RATING: 6
The game feels too easy and therefore lacks the tension necessary for coop games to be exciting. I think the core issue is that players scale much better and faster into late game compared to the enemies. It seems that once we reach the level 15, we should lose instead of gaining an extra super-powerful ability. Overall, a solid gateway/family game because of the simplicity, but I really want something much more challenging. Even the hard mode doesn't make it hard enough.

It may be a little early for heaping such praise on this one, since it's only just come out and I've only played it a few times thus far. But it has to be said, the missions that we've played have really been great fun.

The programming dynamic is really interestingly tackled here, as you are slowly building up your program over several turns. This creates a "snow ball" effect, as your mech starts out ponderous and weak but then becomes a veritable wrecking machine after just a short while.

I plays a lot like a cooperative RoboRally and was clearly inspired by it, as you've got damage that mucks up your program, objective markers to interact with and plenty 'o weapons to load up on.

The components are pretty ridiculous (in a good way) for the price-point, honestly. Although you didn't need me to tell you that. Storage of the box itself may be problematic, as it's bigger than TI3 and probably heavier, too. Oh, to have such problems.

But yes, for a game that is as simple as it is at it's core, this is a really impressive package and just a box full of fun. There are just so many clever little things and it is presented with such charm that you can't help but smile, hoot and holler as you play it.

So, to the surprise of probably absolutely no one at this point, my thumbs up to this delightful "little" programming game. My fingers are crossed for the new edition of RoboRally, in hopes that it too will do great service to the genre.

This game takes what I enjoy about RoboRally (the chaos and programming) shortens it to a reasonable play time (an hour or so) and makes it cooperative. This is by no means a perfect game, but it's one of the very best cooperative games I've ever played. That being said, I suspect it won't have much longevity once we've finished all the scenarios, but I'm okay with that considering how good of an experience it's been.

RATING: 8.5
So it does live up to the hype but I do have a few complaints. 1) While I love the artwork and theme I thought the main characters you play with are generic looking. It feels more like they made characters that they thought would sell rather than characters that actually stand out (a complaint I had with their video game League of Legends) and it doesn't work. It has this generic anthropomorphic cuteness which just doesn't jive with me. 2) The story/plot is flimsier than a Michael Bay movie. I played the game recently and I couldn't even remember what the story is about it is so forgettable but you can tell Riot Games cared about it which is a shame why it fell flat not just for me but everyone who played it in my group.  Other than that the game play is excellent (although I wish they'd have an expansion with more missions) and the component quality is top notch. You do get your monies worth.

Cooperative fantasy steam punk scenarios/campaign miniatures game.  Players begin each round in a real time draft of move and attack cards that are locked into their mech's program banks.  Now it's time to square off against escalating Zerg waves of AI driven minions (video game style) facing various campaign modular board setups and objectives.  Mechs take hits from the damage deck that can foul up their program.  Production quality, art and attention to detail are off the charts.  Pure fun.

As everyone's already said: the amount and quality of the stuff that you get, for the price that you pay is just redonculous. It looks great, great box, and lots and lots of it.

I like how more and more rules unlock as you progress through the game, and I like how much of the rules they give you at the start (they don't hide too much, and not too little).

The gameplay itself is also fun, there's enough degree of working together, and enough degree of autonomy. You can agree on what each of you want to do, but each programs their own mech, and there's not really any deliberation about that (which is always a pitfall in co-op for me).

I initially rated this a 7 after getting into a game in the 3rd campaign for my first ever play.  I was getting the concepts but apparently was missing out on a lot.  

Now that I own it and was able to play with a group starting with the tutorial and playing a few campaigns:  such an awesome game!  I really enjoyed it and look forward to seeing what else is in store.  Programmed movement, escalations, mowing down minions like they are nothing, getting damaged but not killed,... yes please!

Astoundingly great game from a first time creator. Not only is the campaign long and interesting, it has a funny story and an amazing radio play to accompany it, there are so many wild and hilarious things that can happen. So many times one of the mechs spent most of the game stuck in a corner, unable to move, and it still was fun to play!

What's more, there is a lot of replayability, many important choices to make every game dependent on scenario as well as participants... and the potential to create additional content is nigh-limitless. Big fat ten, rightly deserved.

So far... pretty damn fun game!  

**Update** Mission 3 was just a blast.  Super stoked for the next ones.  This game is amazing.

**Update** Mission 4 we beat heartily after a single failure.  Curious to see if the rest of the missions carry the same lower difficulty?  Still super fun and enjoy it with our couple friends.

**Update** Mission 5 took us 3 shots.  Clump up for the win.  First two attempts crunched us bad due to aggressive movement of 1-2 players out of 4 or card mitigation (i.e. didn't see many move cards)

The component quality is definitely as good as everyone says.  Even the box itself is super thick and sturdy (and yes, it very much stands out on my shelf).  The cardboard map tiles are really thick, the minis feel solid, and all the rest of the bits feel great too.  Gameplay wise, after playing the tutorial and reading the rules for mission one, gameplay seems easy enough.  The rules go quickly. The hard part is going to be managing your programming while dealing with the damage, and getting things re-arranged in the right order by scrapping cards.

RATING: 8
After two plays of the game, this has definitely lived up to my expectations. It is in no way a complicated game but it more than makes up for its simplicity with challenging gameplay and a sense of overwhelming odds.

In many ways you can tell that this game is designed by a video game company based on how it feels. I'm quite the fan of online tower defense games, games with upgrades, etc. and this has that feel. Never ending waves of seemingly weak minions coming in to destroy your base or ruin your plans. As you progress from round to round you're constantly upgrading your mech with new abilities and hoping that your program is up to the task. Mix in how damage creates chaos and how easily a "well thought out program loop" can spiral out of control and it all adds up to a light, fun, yet challenging experience.

My only qualm at the moment is that with two players you really have to play the game on "easy mode" because of the overwhelming odds. But other than that, well worth the price of admission. Looking forward to playing this game again soon and with the different player counts.

Érdekes coop játék. Ötletes a programozás szerű cselekvés. A figurák szépek, de lehetnének még szebbek. Az elején elég nehéz, de ha kialakul a megfelelő taktika és a játékosok segítik egymást akkor egész játszható.

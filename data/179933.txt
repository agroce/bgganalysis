RATING: 6
The theme, components and art are top notch. Even the mechanisms are easy to handle with variable set-up action selection. What broke this one for us was the "take that" element in a game that is supposed to represent friendly competition between dog owners. Seriously did that really need to be a part of that should be a cute, delightful and light hearted game?

Rating based on an initial play; will update later. Proud to say I Kickstarted this. Not only is Brent Povis a passionate game designer, but he's a stand-up guy. At first, I balked at the number of components; lots of fiddly-looking little tokens, and a relatively confusing setup (at first). However, true to form, it is 15 minutes to learn (and Brent put together a Learn to Play video available at the Two Lanterns site), and it quickly becomes clear why the componentry is what it is. In practice, the game is smooth, readable, and gives the players many interesting choices. Furthermore, there is a ton of replayability built into the system. Overall, the theme is awesome, the art is fantastic, and the mechanics are engaging and interesting.

I have some minor criticisms regarding the use of color on the tiny little dog icons and "+1" tokens, but if it's bothersome to players, or if players are color-blind, there are easy alternatives. For the most part, adapting this game for color blindness would be a relatively easy task.

Much like in the designer's previous game Morels (now 'Fungi'), the game is built up with the theme. I don't mean that you really will feel like a dog trainer, but that it's clear that everything in the game has been thought about with the theme in mind.

The core of the game is straightforward - play a card to move on the rondel and do a thing - but it flows quite well. However, the start of the game can feel a little slow and it is possible to get hosed and be behind due to a bad opening hand of cards.

Light, but it is undeniably fun though. Who doesn't want to adopt cute dogs that will run courses for you, while you cheer them on as they race to victory? Yeah, I thought so :)

RATING: 7
A little concerned about a first player advantage and lack of catch-up mechanism for a game that seems to run a touch long. After two plays I still think there's something to get better at here, so that might make up for the concerns about the catch-up a little. We did the pseudo-random setup and had a clumpy wheel with most of the activity actions in one group and it made for a tighter game. We still haven't used all the different action spaces and am curious as to the abilities found therein. Cool little game and I love dogs, so I'll be giving this one a lot of table time I'm sure.

Cute, light, short game. The theme is adorable, and the decisions are mildly interesting, but some of the dogs are way better than the others, so it seems like the game is more of a race to get the dogs than anything else. The main action-selection mechanic is very interesting, but is sometimes frustrating if you can't do anything you want on multiple turns (while you watch your opponent do lots of actions). Nice little game as long as you're ok with the randomness.

This game can be played strategically by trying to match the right dog to the right course and by trying to coordinate one dog's movements with the other dogs' movements. That approach ought to keep gamer types content and engaged. I suspect, though, that most people will be attracted to the game for its theme and cute components and will treat it as a fairly light exercise.

The game has nothing to do with the feeling of agility but it is fun mechanically. The dog pictures, meeples, and bone tokens make it really cool if you're a dog person though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice wooden dog bones for Training Treats(resources) and really nice touch that each dog has its own colored wooden meeple!
Cards and Cardboard are good quality too. Standard 2 player size box(Patchwork, etc)

Easy to teach, plays quickly, and gratifying to choose your dog for it's strengths and then pick
your cards wisely to progress them through their agility courses.

Lots of different dogs/courses and variable setup keep each play fresh.

HOW TO PLAY:
You have a few cards to play each round.  They are used in the two phases of everyone's turn.  First phase, the number on the
card tells you which bonus on the action rondel you  will receive.  On the same card is types and amount of Training Treats, which you receive
your choice of.  In the second phase you can purchase a dog and/or advance your dogs on their agility courses using the bonuses
from the action rondel and/or with your Training Treats.  First one to get three dogs to finish their agility courses wins! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun theme, great variety, and a really nice mix of using the rondel to get resources and time special actions. There's great satisfaction to having all of your dogs move at the same time. There's also the balance of adopting dogs and running the courses with the dogs you've already adopted. Very cute game that went over well, so it'll be hitting the table again. Good couples game.

Really fun but tense game. My only complaint is that the little dog icons on each dog card a very hard to see. It makes it hard to match their deeple (dog meeple?). It is a very minor complaint. I enjoyed this game very much. Treats are sometimes hard to hold onto but you have to spend them to adopt and to move. There are some good decisions to be made. ALL components are great.

RATING: 5
Though the colors of treats are theoretically different (some types of obstacles use a specific color), you have to go through most kinds of obstacles to win so I'm not sure that matters. So my allergy to cube-pushers rears up a little here. The numerical card play is also a little hinky. On the other hand, it's really tense due to the swings in initiative that come from syncing up your dogs, and having a dog you saved up for swiped out from underneath you is a big deal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Clever and rewarding. Agility does a great job of connecting the race portion with the rondel through simple resource collection. All three portions of the game connect nicely and make decisions engaging. The game is also a bit "dopey" looking, but this gives it charm. I feel like I'm playing something special when Agility is on the table.

Agility is a 2-player race game, featuring variable boards, variable player powers, and the always gorgeous artwork of Two Lanterns.

Players draft cards to obtain currency, used to obtain dogs or to clear obstacles.

There is also a Rondel which offers additional actions, and drafted cards move tokens about the Rondel, which allows for a little strategy both in one's own placement and for your opponent's.

2017-04-05 - Interesting 2 player rondel game. The theme is cute and fun. It doesn't have as much variety as I would like, in part because I don't think I would enjoy the optional "take that" actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Agility uses card drafting and an action rondel to power a game about adopting and racing dogs through agility courses. Cards are numbered 1-9 and list two resource types. Each turn you play a card to move around the rondel and collect one of the two resources. Resources come in 5 bone-shaped colors. You use bones to pay for adopting dogs from the display and also use them to shepherd your dog through the various agility tests. Each type of test requires a different mix of bones. Each turn has two parts - play a card to take an action and collect bones and then adopt and/or move your dogs. First player to have three dogs complete their courses wins the game.

The most interesting aspect of the game is that each dog has unique advantage and combining the right dog with the right available course is pretty key. Every breed of dog has a different color, making for a colorful collection of dog meeples. But the heart of the game is really collecting and paying bones in the most efficient manner possible. Despite how thematic the components are, the bones represent an abstract of "training" and moving bones from one pile to another repeatedly didn't feel much like training got a bit tiresome for me. However, my daughter grooves on the theme and I enjoy having a game to play with her, so in spite of my lack of enthusiasm, I get the feeling I'll be holding on to this one for a while.

This is Two Lanterns' second title after [thing=122298][/thing], another thematic two-player game that I enjoy more. Brent Povis designed both games. This is a new designer and company to keep an eye on for sure!

Purchased at Gen Con 2016.   Probably the most overshadowed game that will not get played by most people.  The Rondel in this game is ingenious, the modularity of the rondell adds to the replayability, while multi purpose cards and training choices give Agility its depth.  This is all before you choose which dogs to adopt and which agility courses to tackle.

[b]Agility[/b] was given to my daughter.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Unfortunately this was a major disappointment for me. I am a huge fan of Morels, it is a 2p classic in our house that everyone loves so I had high hopes for Brett's second game. The theme is awesome and unique, and I really like the dog illustrations. However; the game play fell flat for us and didn't capture the combination of simple rules with engaging game play. I found the choices you make in the game to be pretty straightforward and not that interesting. The separate mechanics of the game don't integrate very well and the whole game felt cumbersome which is just the opposite of Morels.

All that said I am still happy I backed the game on Kickstarter and I wish Brett continued success and I'll continue to support his projects. I definitely think other families will enjoy this game, but for us it was too light and straight forward. My older daughter is keeping the game, she loves the extra pieces we got with our dog Parker's name on them.[/i]

Amazingly awesome dog and bone meeple components. The gameplay is fun as well, with tight resource management and some clever actions which can be shuffled and moved from game to game to make a custom rondel for the game. Very clever and pretty neat. Feels like you get a lot of game in a small box.

My girlfriend added a house rule that we had to pantomime with the meeples how the dog passed each agility objective, and liked to say 'Good boy!' after they passed each section. It was very cute. I wish there were more thinky strategy games that are themed around dogs.

I'm completely enamored with this game. The components are fantastic, the pacing is great, and the decisions are exactly what I'm looking for in a game like this. Not too crunchy, but heavy enough that your gamer friends will really like it. It's got kind of a perfect weight in that way. I really enjoy combining the action on the rondel with your dog's feature to string together super turns that really can swing the game in your favor. Also I think the way the tiebreak is handled is genius. Incorporating it into the game REALLY impressed me. Love this one.

I picked this one up to play with my wife because we are both into dogs.  The mechanics are fairly simple - acquiring different colored cubes and using those cubes to advance your dogs down an agility track - but they do enough to maintain the theme.  There is some interesting card play where you move around a roundel to determine with action you can take.  It's by no means a strategic gamer's game, but fits nicely if you want something light with a dog theme.

There are few 2 player only euro style games that really manage to not feel like you are playing the same game over and over.  This is certainly one that has done a good job of crafting a little game system that you enjoy doing the thing each time you play.  It's fun.  It's creative.  I really like the idea of the communal rondel instead of a rondel where you have you own piece to move the piece moves on each player's turn.  It can be cool, and it can be totally frustrating sometimes.  IMO that's the mark of a good game.

A lot of great 2 player game in a small box.  Component quality is great!  Very cool meeples - a specific color dog meeple for all the dogs in the game and cool colored bone meeples for treats.  With a rondel mechanic for the action board, with a variable set-up and the ability to add advanced actions.   The theme is unique obviously, not sure how many folks out there would pick this theme for a game.  Has a small luck factor, but if you plan well, you can overcome it.  All and all, a great 2 player game, and a good follow up to Morels!!

A delightfully themed puzzly race where players have to balance selecting from their hand a single card that both generates the resources they need and a rondel-style action. The tension between these conflicting needs provides satisfying decisions as does the race within the race of being the first to adopt your dogs or finish a course. I particularly like that despite the tactical play each card moves you toward big plays can be lined up over the long term striking a nice balance between tactics and strategy.

Pretty simple two player filler. I might buy it if it was under $15 and needed to fulfill free shipping requirements, but I would look for other things to buy first. This is a game for those who do not like to lose big. We played two vastly different strategies and it came down to the tiebreaker token.

100531 hmm a little more stressful than I prefer.  I think the double bluffing element (once while chosing cards, and also during play) is a bit much for me.  I really don't think that I like simultaneous action selection games (where you can get knocked off your game).

A clever, light game of double think and second guessing. I can't really take it too seriously, but enjoy the ride for what it is worth. Three players does not seem worth it... I think this game needs its full compliment of players to really shine.

Given to me in a secret Santa a few years ago. Mechanically similar to Citadels but just different enough to keep it fun and interesting. I like both games just about equally, but tend to end up playing Citadels more because it can play a few more people and my groups tend to run a little large.

Surprisingly fun to play, it's pretty much a bluffing game combined with (as one player pointed out) a card version of Kingsburg. Easy going resource management, funny role cards and smashing your opponent - you have to take this game lightly and play with at least 4 people. I don't see it working with less (and 6 is certainly the limit). Over all, I really liked it.

因為小P不喜歡，原本已經把它打入冷宮，近來又嘗試一次5人局
祐龍跟李榮玩得相當不錯，我也漸漸玩出醍醐味，所以改為8分，
特別的優點在於，玩這遊戲需要相當專注，沒時間使用手機，這很加分。

Much better than expected.  It's chaotic, but not overly so.  It's a game of resource management, mini economics, bluff, and double-bluff.  I'm very pleased with this game.

RATING: 6
A game that plays fast, has good artwork and the gameplay needs thought to have a consistent win rate. The planning and bluffing is there like most games of its genre but the vials needed to score the potions you made changes everything as without them having a lot of potions is still 0 points. So it has 2 parts to achieving victory and thus more ways to stop your opponents from scoring. One can also roleplay the characters on the cards and it's text as much or little as one wishes with little effect on the strategy, which expands the kind of gaming groups that will like it. 
Downside is some will just play it without thinking that saps all strategy out of the game but in conclusion, one of the best fillers I have played yet.

RATING: 9
What an excellent game!  Gameplay revolves around choosing 5 roles out of 12 to play/act.  Then you go round and round.  Leader leads a role.  If they have that role in their hand of 5, others can preempt leader (for the same, greater benefit) or follow (for a lesser but guaranteed benefit).  Points are earned from acquiring cauldrons, bookcases and vials.  Game ends when someone purchases the fourth card having a raven on it.

This one is just fun!  The variety of actions is a bit overwhelming (so don't play this with the AP-inclined), but there's quite a bit to this game.  Essentially, it's about earning resources and converting them to VP, but the preemption/following decision adds a very nice twist.  Do you preempt the one leading it before you and hope no one after you has it, or do you follow to obtain the guaranteed benefit?

Even with 5 players it was excellent.  Lots of preemption, very tight gameplay, but loads of fun.  The theme is excellent and well implemented, well connected to gameplay.  Has a small poker feel in trying to predict whether players after you will preempt the role, making it better to follow, balanced against how much you want to perform that role.  In addition, the game plays rather quickly.  We were able to finish a 5 player game (4 being new players) in about an hour (maybe less).

Biggest plus of all is how well-balanced the gameplay is.  If you successfully lead a role, you start the next round of roles, making it much less likely that you will be able to successfully lead that round.  That is, by gaining the biggest benefit, you're automatically put in the worst position by having to lead the next role.  This balances out the screwage element so well that it's amazing.  This near-perfect balance is probably why I love this game so much.

Negatives include the potential for AP and the art for the cauldrons.  With 12 roles amongst which to choose 5, the role choosing is the largest time sink.  I can't imagine playing this with someone known for their AP -- would take forever.  Also, the 3 different cauldrons are somewhat hard to distinguish since you have to go by look of the cauldron and color of the liquid in it.  Would have been helpful if the publisher had put letters or numbers or some other identifier on the cauldron types.

Just a fun game!  I love the theme (snake venom?  wolf's blood?  awesome!) and it works very well.  The game length is very nice, maybe a hair short if anything.  It's not too hard to figure out the game and play it, the worst part being the 12 roles.  I look forward to playing it more in the future!  Depending on its reception and further games played, has the potential to go from a 9 to a 10.

I heard of this game a long time ago, and finally was able to acquire it. I like this game better than Citadels, and it fills a similar role.

I wish it weren't so hard to get an English version though.  Very cool role selection game, deeper and more fun than citadels for me.

RATING: 7.3
A fun light bluffing game.  Mildly subject to binding issues (since it's generally in your interest to pick cards that your RHO picks, and to avoid cards your LHO picks, and so a person whose choices are easily guessed will make the game harder for non-neighbours).  The game plays like a strange melange of a bunch of traditional card games - there's a healthy amount of lead-avoidance, bluff and semi-sinking tricks (choosing 'so be it' to manage who has the lead).

A pretty decent euro game, but it feels a lot like many other euro games.  You choose a role based on deduction of what other characters do/don't want, and then gain items (in the form of ingredients) and use those items to trade in for victory points (in the form of potions.  Overused mechanics in my opinion, but the game is a still a good game.

RATING: 7
Interesting fusion of a kind of role selection/trick taking. The actions of the various roles also provide a thought provoking set of options. Definitely a good game. I'd probably rate it 8 (very good) if further experience indicated to me that there's more strategy hiding beneath the surface. I've been able to use some strategy so far... 

But there were just a lot of lucky swings coming out of nowhere. That certainly added to the tension, but it was a little more chaos than I prefer.

I think Witch's Brew is a fun "group game," very much reminiscent of Citadels, but in its own way, I think better than Citadels. The "role decision making" which drives this game is richer and more interesting than Citadels, and the nastiness is dialed down a few notches, which I think makes for a happier experience for all players.

Some fun timing and "should I take the lead now?" decision making makes for a fun, relatively short group game (30-45 minutes). This game deserves at least as much attention among gamers as Citadels. Check it out!

RATING: 6.5
A light game playable with 8-9 years old which can slightly introduce them to resource management.

All the salt in the game is guessing if the next player(s) chose the same card as you or not, besides choosing your own cards right.
So with 3 players the game can become rather dull pretty soon. Much better played with 4 or 5 players.

Stands between a light strategy game and a party game.

The mid-size Alea series is a set of games that seems to exist in flux between meaty and pure filler.  That sense of flux is well represented by Witch's Brew.  The style and feel of the game is clearly filler in nature, but the deeper mechanics hint at a more involved game.  It's too quirky to be a super-filler and its thematically misaligned to be taken too seriously.  Game play also shares the same mixed experience.  Elements are straight up and crocked all at once.  Worth playing, especially as a closer or a bridge game in the course of a game night.  It's unlikely to make the headlines.

RATING: 5
I enjoy the risk of selecting the same character as another person who might then prevent you from doing anything. The potion making just seemed to fill the game out so that there would be more than character selection, which is really all that I find interesting about this one.

Boring game.

The choices of roles may seem strategic, but the game is too chaotic to matter.

The choosing of the timing of play is by far more interesting than the choice of the roles themselves.  But still not very interesting at all (like saying the choices in Life is so much more interesting than the choices in Candyland).

RATING: 8.1
A second-guessing game involving first role selection (5 of 12), then either taking the safe option for that role or gambling that you will be the last/only one to claim the role in full. Fast and full of interesting decisions/guesses.

Feels similar to Diamant, so it probably wont entertain serious gamers for too long, yet it is too complex a game to introduce to newbies.

However, it is a lot of fun while it lasts.

Wow... One of the best role selection games I have played.  I now am very curious why they took this game and stream lined it as "Broom Service" rather than just reprinting the game...

I found the choices of picking your roles, or using the 2ndary ability to not have to lead the next round to be very interesting.  Very interested in playing this one more.  I also now need to check out Broom Service very soon!

If you get a full compliment of players this game is a riot.  It's a chaotic little role selection game where you're trying to complete potions for points.

Man, this is way cooler than I thought it was going to be. Has become a lunch game of choice. Has the second-guessing of many games, but in a more general or obtuse way, where one bad guess isn't going to swing the game horribly on one direction or another. Best with 5. If playing with 3 or 4, make sure to use the variant rule in the rule book, that encourages more collisions.

This game creates great moments. An incredible design.

It's Alea, so it's more "game" than probably necessary. The concept is clever and I hope the author reuses it in the future for a lighter game. (Not that this is heavy at all, but the core idea could be distilled even further.)

I found this to be a quick, fun game of doublethink.  Not a ton of control, but since the same player won twice I tend to believe there is something to the game.  The game looks more involved until you play.  I enjoy the names on the cards and rather use those than "The alchemist".  Mixy is a favorite of mine.

RATING: 8
It's got only a little in common with these games, but I Witch's Brew would appeal to poker and bridge players.
Everyone I've taught this to liked it, most loved it. There's a good amount of space for strategizing, but the role-selection nature of the game means that it is intrinsically chaotic (think Citadels, Mission: Red Planet). However, the game is short enough (20-40 minutes) that you don't have time to get attached to your strategy, so getting completely fudged up by the chaos is not very painful.
Hits a sweet spot that few games do.

An okay game of guessing what your opponents will do, but I'm not very fond of the guessing mechanic.  Best for those who dig reverse-reverse-reverse psychology... but it can work okay in the forward direction too once you get the gist of the game.  It has a secret action selection mechanism that resembles Citadels mixed with Goldbrau, however, everyone has the same set of 12 character cards and secretly picks 5 for the round... then uses them to try to gain money, ingredients and points.   Generally, you want to pick something that nobody else wants (for the biggest reward) or pick something everyone else will pick in order to hurt opponents and be the last man standing to win the big reward for that character card.

This one felt like a meatier Citadels (Machiavelli). Hidden role selection and trying to outthink your opponents. It's less chaotic than Citadels because the strategy of your opponents is more visible. That makes it a bit more thinking vs guessing.

Still, pressing your luck, or incomprehensable decisions from the other players can have a huge impact. For some that would be the fun of the game, but I'm finding myself planning too much and really be discouraged by seemingly random events. It's an okay game I guess. It doesn't drag on too much.

Fun game.  The card choosing mechanism is interesting because there are usually several ways of getting your points and sometimes you have to balance offense and defense with respect to the Thief and Begging Monk.  Also, I love the subtle choices of being greedy for the full favor of the card versus the "So be it!" action which gives you much less but keeps you from leading the next trick.

RATING: 9
I don't give out many 10 ratings, but Witch's Brew has really snuck up on me. It's probably not quite as replayable as some of the games I'd give a 10 to, but it's really amazingly clever and subtle, plus it's short and has a very high fun factor. This is a game that holds its own in the top ranks of alea games.
---
UPDATE: The rating keeps moving up as I play it more ... and also as I correct rules misunderstandings. I think the game works well with 4 or 5.
---
Light, even on the scale of Rum & Pirates, but clever. I liked it, but it's a good thing it's pretty short. On the one hand, it seems like it's *so* short that the game really doesn't have much of a chance to develop (at least with 5, the number I played with). On the other hand, while there is some subtlety to the game, there is also significant chaos and some screwage, so it needs to be short-ish. So I dunno. Fun, but probably doesn't quite find the sweet spot and ultimately disposable. But, again, it is fun.

Although the language is not a serious barrier to playing the German-language edition (other than the rules), wait for the English version if that's your first language - the game is more fun if the names and roles are readable and pronounceable, even if the icons are sufficient for game purposes. I got the German version only because a US version hadn't been announced at the time, and I wasn't sure one was going to be done. In retrospect, I would have waited for the Rio Grande edition (and probably will end up getting it as well if I like the game at all).

RATING: 8
A really neat game that really opens up strategy-wise once everyone gets a few plays under their belts. The amulet mini-expansion (which is easy enough to implement on your own) adds a nice bit of non-hidden information and a one time "get out of jail" card that I think really improves the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While I'm not normally a huge fan of doublethink games where you have to guess what your opponents might and might not do, this one is light enough and interesting enough that I don't mind it.  Although this is not at all a trick taking game, for some reason it had a little bit of a trick-taking feel to me, as one player would "lead" a card and hope it didn't get "trumped", meaning they hope that no one chose the same card in their 5 card hand.  The winner of the "trick" gets to take an action related to the played card.  When you have the "lead" play, you really have to be judicious as to which actions you really want, and actions you can live without, as there's always a good chance of getting "trumped".  Overall, a pretty neat little game that has a different feel than pretty much anything else I've played.

An interesting twist on role selection. You get to choose a selection of roles from a set of roles (each player has the same) each round. But given the way each role can only be used by one player, I'm really not sure whether any strategy is better than random selection. There probably is some merit to choosing which role to select when you go first, and whether to be "it" or to "so be it" when you're not last player in a round. Definitely a lot of fun, in a moans & groans kind of way.

At the end of a very long day of playing games, the host surprised the remaining guests of that day with this box from Alea. He had tried to play it once before, but had to break off the attempt, but now he had four 'fresh' victims at his disposal, and so proceeded to work his magic on us. 

Although as a rule I like games with blind bidding, I found it a bit of an annoying excercise in this game. The problem lies, I think, with the fact that of the 12 character cards at your disposal, each player chooses 5. This more or less renders any reverse pshychology consideration, whether truly effective or just 'in the mind', moot. The cards can be arranged in groups, true, but the overlap isn't that good. If someone is low on ingredients, he has four cards to chose from in order to replenish stock. And who says he isn't going for the beggar? Same with money, or with people having lots of resources, and so forth. And even if you [i]do[/i] outguess people—and that is assuming you can spend the effort in blocking others instead of helping yourself—there's player order to consider. You're only safe if you are the last in line, but trying to predict that is next to impossible. In other words, there is no need to consider much about another player's hand because it is literally anybody's guess. As a consequence I never spent more than a moment or two considering what the other players might have, and I don't think I did too bad. I probably could have done a bit better, true, but not by much. Adding insult to injury, one player chose his cards at random, and got more points than me! Okayokay, n00bs, yaddayaddayadda. But we learnt the ropes pretty quickly—and I have yet to meet someone who can tell me how to 'guess' what your opponents are up to with some accuracy.

All in all, I suppose there is a nice little game in there, but it is exactly that: little. Everyone at the table agreed that Wie verhext! was somewhat fun to play, but that the overall game experience was lackluster and a bit boring. The perfect 5, really.

A light, trick-taking game for [gameid=478]-style roles, with the goal of mixing up potions that equal victory points. The roles are self-balancing, in that winning a trick puts you in the hot-seat to start the next sequence of cards, thereby increasing the chances that you will then be trumped. Nice game that plays quickly.

I really like this, and it has been a hit with all of my friends. It shares some elements with other games that I like such as San Juan (role selection), and Dominion (using action cards, buying victory cards), but the theme is way more fun than either of those games.  I really love the wooden droplet tokens, and the fun art style.  Everyone gets a kick out of the part of the game where you announce your chosen role. So be it!

This is a great role selection game that never overstays its welcome, has an easy set up and isn't complicated to score at the end. I have no idea why this game doesn't get more love. It is all about playing the table instead of playing the game, which makes this one a keeper.

With all the recent brouhaha around Broom Service, I thought I would give this earlier iteration of the system a try with the family.  My overall feeling is that it is kinda fun and mildly strategic, but I'd rather play Citadels or Libertalia.  The whole "I cancel your action and you don't get to do a darn thing" mechanism really isn't that fun for me, at least not when it happens with this regularity.  (If you get assassinated in Citadels, you just need to be tricksier next time)

As always with Andreas Pelikan's designs, you get a highly original game here that people will love while playing, but they won't often ask for a replay. Somehow you're not sucked into the game enough neither by the theme nor by the mechanics. I still like it a lot. Every turn you choose five of the available characters (everyone has the same characters in thieir card hand) to get their respective advantages, but only one player can actually perform the character's tasks. Good for you if you are the only one who chose this character. Good for you if you're not, because maybe you can screw with other players' plans. The more players the better, didn't really work for us with 3 players.

It's hard to talk about this game and not mention Citadels as both are card driven role selection games.  Is it better?  Yes, yes it is.  Getting 'screwed' in this game doesn't feel as bad as getting assassinated in Citadels since you play multiple roles in a single round. So, it would probably work better for people who dislike 'take that' elements in their games. The roles selection is also more interesting in this game. I think the thing it really does better than Citadels is having a more consistent play time and that it's usually shorter than Citadels.  Good game.

RATING: 6
Quite random game where shuffling your cards and selecting 5 perhaps creates better results than selecting them (as you will not select what others will expect). Still this can be kind of fun in the right group, not in a groundbreaking way, but the game is communicative enough to draw in non-gamers. A strange game to select for Alea though, which seems to be on a trend to more lighter, family friendly games.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A hidden role selection game where everyone has access to the same set of roles. The second-guessing and mind-games involved add substance to what is otherwise a pretty light card game. There is a great deal of joy to be derived from smacking someone down with a smug "Nuh-uh! [i]I[/i] am the wizard!"

This game is a crapfest of luck, but every game is filled with much laughter, it plays quick, and I really enjoy the thought process that goes on for card selection and play.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable light bluffing game with role selection. The roles are selected simultaneously but play out sequentially, with players later in turn order having to advantage of being able to trump earlier players.

The role actions are used to gather ingredients and to ultimately turn them into potions which score points. There is a constant struggle for position since being late in turn order vastly improves your chances to get your chosen role granted.

This might be the game that Citadels always wanted to be.

RATING: 7
An interesting blend of blind bidding, bluff, role selection, resource, risk and hand management.  Witch's Brew is a fun spirited little card game in which each round players choose 5 of 12 possible roles and then try to adopt their identities to take advantage of their power.  Each role has a primary and secondary function, so the trick is to know (guess) when the right time to try and steal the primary is.  If you are successful rewards are plenty, if not you get nothing, as only one player can adopt the full role.  Plenty of take that moments, and lots of laughs.  Although it is a light game, there is a lot of solid gameplay, and the choices one makes isn't entirely random. Everything is open information except the hands of players, so quick deduction can give players an idea of what roles are of more interest than others to their competition.  Finding a balance between getting out of phase with others and playing timely aggressive or defensive roles is key.  Great game that finds itself tucked into a strong time/weight ratio.

UPDATE:  This game is vastly superior with more players.  With three it ultimately becomes I hope that one player next to me doesn't steal my role.  With four and five the decision to "so be it"  becomes much more valid.

What a good, good game.  Deciding whether to go for the gusto and claim the Role's action on a card or settle for the guaranteed but smaller "so be it" payout is a deliciously tough call much of the time.  The two "screw your neighbor" roles where you make others help pay for your victory points also keep people from holding on to too many potion ingredients--a great way to keep your foes on their toes.

Yes it's a fun game as long you don't expect that your plans are going to work. The more players the less predictable. Serious gamer will prefer other offerings from alea but it's ok from time to time.
A Remark to the expansion from "Schatzkiste". It adds an 6th player which is ok. The other offerings like the amulet or the cards do not make the game more complex but easier; most of these expansion units offer player a simpler way to get their brews and drinks which undermines the games original intention to collect resources in different colors to get those magic potions.

This was quite a success with some enthusiastic, but casual gamers.  I thought that the process of selecting 5 of 12 roles would be a little brain burning, but the game flowed quite well.

Really, I'm just trying to fill out the collection to justify the purchase of Alea's Treasure Chest.

After one play with only two players, it seems like it is a nice game, that will work just fine with more players. It's not bad with two, in fact some parts became quite nasty as we traded 'No I am' between us. But most of the time it was rather plain.

Second play was with 4players and looked much better, though I must say I though that I'd see more 'So Be It' than what actually happened.

A fun role selection game with "doublethink" as essentially a secondary mechanic. How much do you want to push your luck to get "at least something" and how likely do you think it is that the other players chose the same role?

Entertaining and I'd definitely pick it up were it not obscenely expensive in English right now. Too much text for people not familiar with the game to play it in a foreign language comfortably is my guess, so not interested in the German version right now (but might change my mind eventually...)

Edit: Completely replaced by Broom Service, which uses the same basic idea but in a fuller game.

Similar in feel of trick-taking card games, but instead of taking the trick, you get money, potion materials, or victory points. Pick five out of ten different role cards, and then play them out one at a time. Other players may then either pass, say "so be it", or trump the first card with their own. There's lots of strategy here, simple to play, and lots of fun.

Jan09: Amazingly solidly OKAY.  I didn't really love it in my first play.  We did a full 5 players, so the play dynamic was in full force.

The choices just weren't as deep as I would like.  Maybe I wasn't as good at reading the other players, but choosing the 5 of 12 still seemed a lot like a crap shoot.  I was hoping for more double think.

The card play was really fun though.  I liked the combination of trick taking and poker bluff.  I can think of very few times that I had an obvious choice.

On a side note, the different cauldrons shapes are *horribly* differentiated.  They so should have done better there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
For what it is, this is really great. Plays fast, is a lot of fun, and while not particularly deep, one needs to think a little carefully when choosing the roles, etc. Should grow more fun when playing over with the same group, as one will be able to figure out more what their opponents are likely to pursue.

The rating is for 5 players. It's a little lower for 4 and much lower for 3.

Role selection and hand management. Fun with 5 players, and plays relatively quickly (though AP prone folks can take a while with role selection). Reminds me of Citadels, but more enjoyable...less downtime and ganging up on people.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2011)

I love bluffing games so I like this game or at least that part of the game,  it has some strategy but it is mostly chaos, I think the game can be very well played with a "strategy" of pure randomness (and you have a good shot at winning) and I suspect it can get worse with more players, the good news is the short play time. Having said all that, I think I can enjoy it from time to time but it is not a game I would want to play often.

I played it again and still feel it is so random. It plays better with the expansion as I can plan better but not by much.

Bottom line, the luck and chaos is too much. A player can choose his cards at random and do well in the game. I won't pursue anymore plays of Witch´s Brew. 

Current Rating: 4.5

2015-10-12

My desire to play Witch´s Brew is VERY low. I almost can say I despise the game. Broom Service is a bit better but I also dislike it.

The first player is always hosed no matter what he must play the most powerful card effect.

As I said before, in one of my plays, a friend really chose his cards at random and won the game. I won’t play it ever again. Way too much uncontrolled luck for me.

Solo and single ftf play only - nice game.

I get the Citadels comparisons, but it has a flavour of its own. There's an element of bridge/whist style trick taking and hand leading, except that in this game you don't want to lead, and thus it pays to manoeuvere the lead to others for the trick you want to take. 

Nice major power (but can you hang on to it?)/minor power choice when the cards drop, too.

Recommended.

I've played four times now and each time was a completely different experience.  I guess that it really depends on the mind sets of the players involved.

One game concentrated on cauldrons, the next on shelves and spells, and the last one was won my a player who concentrated on buying vials with a few other cards thrown in for good measure.

I enjoyed playing each time... which, for a new release these days, is a rarity.  It's was much more fun to me than Galaxy Trucker (for example)... a great addition to the alea/Rio Grande line of games.  An easy '8' for me.

RATING: 6
A very original game with an enjoyable blend of mechanics. Several layers of decisions to be made along the way. Not a theme that does a lot for me and I don't see much repeat playability here, but this is a novel game worth checking out.

Usually when I play a game that is highly rated and I don't care for it, I can still appreciate why some rate it so high (such as Twilight Struggle, for example). Witch's Brew, though, baffles me on this count. The key decision involves guessing which actions your opponents will choose to play. Every player has a deck of 12 cards. Each round players select 5 to have in their hand. Cards have a primary and secondary power. A player plays a card for the primary power (which involves either getting gold, collecting ingredients or brewing potions) and then in turn order if players have the same card in their hands they [b]must[/b] play it. They can either claim the primary power, thereby taking it from the previous player, or claim the secondary power, which is protected from being taken by any subsequent players with the same card. You continue in this way trying to collect potions until certain cards are purchased that will end the game.

While I think the game is clever in some ways, I don't think there are enough interesting decisions. While there might be some bluffing and misdirection that you can add to the game in table talk, the gameplay really boils down to if you were lucky in picking your 5 cards. I would not even bother playing this game with 3 as the motivation for accepting the secondary power largely evaporates.

To top the uninteresting play, random rules are thrown in. Pay an extra ingredient when buying a potion to get an extra vial? Huh?

RATING: 7
You are trying to collect ingredients or coins to get cards that give victory points. You select a set of 5 cards from 12 for the round. The trick is trying to anticipate what other players will play. If they follow with the same card and decide to take the full value they cancel your chance at doing the main option on the card. If they are not the last player they may do a "so be it" to take partial value and then the starting player still gets the full value. There is some light strategy in all of this, enough to keep it entertaining. So early in the round when everyone has a lot of cards and you go first there is a good chance you will lose that hand.

RATING: 9
Really fun and clever game. I love games with a little psychological warfare, this has it in the drawing of 5 cards to use each round. You'd love to choose roles that there will be little competition for, but you also need to think about the order certain roles will be played by others especially when trying to decide if you're going to get caught by the beggar or the cutpurse. 
There's also some nice decisions in when to declare the full action and what card to play once you're the start player.

I've only played with 5 since the game seems to lose some charm at lower numbers... though mechanically it seems fine. I've really enjoyed it so far, a perfect medium weight card game.

I've played with 4 a few times now and it isn't quite as good with 4, but still very fun and playable, I would never play with less than this though. The higher numbers add a lot of pain to the decision of doing the full action or not, there's also much more chance that everyone's cards will be represented among the cards chosen by others.

I've also moved the rating from 8 to 9. This game is consistently enjoyable, everyone that plays it enjoys it too and it's so simple and clever... really my life is better now that I've played this game... honestly it's that good!

Simultaneous action selection is one of my favourite game mechanisms and Wie verhext! is a good representative of this genre. Too bad, that many people don't see the merits of the mechanism. Wie Verhext! has passed the crucial random selection test which two of my fellow players made. Both ended up dead last. There's definitely choices that matter. QED! The essential part here is the preselection of 5 from 12 available role cards. But there's a second interesting decision in the order of playing the 'tricks' when it's your turn to decide. Best with the maximum number of players and I wouldn't play with less than 4.

I've been generally surprised by the really low ratings this game has received.  It is definitely different than the usual Alea fare, but it is a fun idea that is well executed and a blast to play.  The theme is boring, and the components are ho hum, but if you like groupthink/double-guessing games with some screwage you can't go wrong.  I can see how this game is not for everyone, especially those that cannot deal with a lack of control.  But I really enjoy these types of games (it feels similar to Fist of Dragonstones and other Faidutti designs) and this plays quickly, and may even be more fun in German than in English.  How can you refuse a game where you get to proclaim, "No, I'm the Schlangenfanger!"

This was top of my want list, but OOP prices were ridiculous.  I lucked out and found it for $5 at Savers.  Cards sleeved...including the expansion. (Ended up selling the game for $85, but I have a PNP version that I'm cobbling together.) 

I have to say it lives up to it's billing as a fun little card game.  Very impressed upon first play and while maybe not worth a Benjamin, it's a great addition to my collection.

Treasure Chest (Print-n-Play) (2009)

Witch's Brew is a fun, light game that is all about trying to predict what your opponents are going to do, all the while you mask your own intentions. I decided to put my copy together as a PnP, but the hours I spent tweaking image files were worth it. WB has so much player interaction with tons of tension as you go around the table, seeing if someone is going to steal your role from you. It rewards planning, but it's challenging because it just might happen that you can't do what you absolutely needed to do. And for all of this tension and interaction there is very little downtime. The game is brilliantly designed and plays quickly. Every person I've introduced this game to has enjoyed it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So far, everyone that tried to play at least one game in my playgroups liked it, that's probably the first time it ever happened!

While it is not a card game, merely a board game implemented with cards, it makes it very easy to carry around, so this is a definite plus. The most important novelty of this game is how you can select actions that will basically negate the same action done by your opponents.

This game is great for 3 players but horrendous with 5 players, it scales very badly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Might look simple, but it really requires of you to think to play the right "roles"
I admit if it wasn't Filosofia editing the french version(the one I got) I would give it a higher score.  I loathe Filosofia price hicking tactics.  They make good rule translation, but they empt your pockets without any remorse.  French players, get the english version and save your hard earned money.

While it needs lots of outguessing during the card choosing phase (this part seems to be almost too hard for a family game) it finally boils down to luck. I can't explain my first-play-win any other way; I didn't really know what I was doing and still won. (2009-10-08)

(edit: probably my unexpected card play was the key; playing silly meant I had the main action quite often.)

Very very light, cutely themed card based game.  There's limited strategy and depth, play is very straightforward (think Citadels) and it's fairly chaotic/random with limited real player control.  Surely there's room for this, I'm just not sure what it is.  I'd rather play Biblos, Poison, Coloretto or ForSale in that slot.

Enjoyable, lightweight doublethink/outguessing game in which each person chooses 5 of 12 roles simultaneously.  Players have the option of going for it all and picking the main role or going with the secondary and lesser option (which is sometimes done intentionally to keep the first person going first!).

I enjoyed this bluffing/set collection game. I'm a big fan of the "so be it" action each card has. My only wish is that it played just a bit faster so I could call it a nice filler rather than just a light card game. Took about an hour with 5 guys and I didn't notice anyone really taking their time. Maybe it'll speed up with additional plays.

This is a great game. Loved the theme and gameplay especially the bluffing. But it didn't work for us because of the player count unfortunately (our kids were too young for it at the time). Then when our kids were a bit older, Broom Service came along with everything we liked about Witch's Brew plus more and that fit our family much better.

RATING: 7
Based on one play with five. There's a lot of chaos here, but quite a bit of strategy. It's probably in the same realm of the second half of For Sale when it comes to the level of luck and screwage there can be, however there's a glimmer of depth here that more plays might reveal.

Update:

After dozens of plays I think this one is best with 4, however the overall experience is as I had originally observed; it is one part chaos, one part strategy. It certainly helps knowing the other players so as you can divine some knowledge of their possible next moves.

Solid 7. Oh, and I will also say the game is a bit long with 5 as this one is a "the faster the better" kind of game.

One play- this one was quite fun, although I suspect the result is pretty random and as a result it would wear thin fast.  Certainly a good one to play with children but I won't be likely to get it for an adult group; Citadels remains tactically superior.

Played someone's copy when it was first released in US, but fail to get a copy later. Fortunately Taiwan re-published this in Chinese and I finally got 1.
Lots of double guessing and quite chaotic so many players would not like it. However, I find this game perfect if I want just a little mental challenge like after long hours of work. Despite the chaotic nature, good grasp of other's condition can definitely mitigate some of the randomness.
The very local Chinese translation adds quite a lot of fun to an already well designed game.
Highly recommended!

Although the implementation here is skewed towards the family rather than the gamer end of the complexity scale, I very much like how the character cards and their abilities are handled. Apart from always giving you the option to get at least some use out of every card you choose, timing of your plays is important and provides some tactical choices not only during card selection, but also during the actual playing. Something like it in a less straightforward game might be a winner for me.
Played once.

Ok, this is a really fun one.  Don't expect to have much control, as much of the game just depends on luck.  There is some indirect bluffing going on, guessing if your opponent will do what makes the most sense, or not do that because he assumes you'll guess that he'll do that... you know, that kind of fun double guessing.  Pretty fun.

On paper I loved the sound of this, and it looked like a fun game. In practice I sucked at it in a way that meant I didn't have as much fun as I would have liked, unlike many other games I suck at. Although they're not identical, of course, I much prefer Citadels.

The cards and bits are excellent, and the use of ravens in the card art is a subtle and enjoyable touch. The roles have character and flavor, and they nicely convey the whimsy of the game without sacrificing usability. The differences between the cauldrons are harder to spot than I'd like, though.

When I decided I wasn't likely to play it again, I got rid of it.

After finally tracking down a copy of this out of print game.  Let me say that this game unbelievably awesome.
After playing it, I've been dreaming about it and constantly thinking about this game.  That's how good it is.

I really enjoyed it and so did my gamer & non-gamer friends.  I was really surprised that my non-gamer friend would like this.

It's a role selection/bidding/points collection game.  To see who will win the right to be the potion maker.  BUT if your opponents bid the same card as you, they knock you out.  So you need to think about what role they might choose, and they might be thinking that about your cards...if he plays this card I should play this, what if he plays that...argh!!

It's best played with 4-5.  Doesn't work that well with 3 players.  I really want to get my hands on the Treasure Chest expansion to allow for extra players, and for an alternative 3 player game.

It plays quickly.  About 40 minutes.  It has a feeling of a filler but it's a lot deeper than that.  Definitely keeping this in my collection!

Great theme, really enjoyable.

This game really suits my group.  Wish someone would reprint it :)  Hint hint... So I can buy MORE copies of it to give to my friends.  That's how good the game is.
This is one FANTASTIC game. 

Hoping to increase the rating to 10 after I play it a lot more :)

RATING: 7
For a simultaneous action selection game this one works quite well because it has a twist.  You choose the role cards ahead of time (5 of 12).  Then a player plays a card and claims that roll: I am XXX."  In turn-order players who selected the same card must play it and exclaim: "So Be It" where they get a small reward OR "No, I am XXX." in which case the person who claimed it before gets nothing.  This continues until everyone with that card has had a turn.  The player who ended up with the roll (XXX) gets the large reward described on the card (money, potion ingredients, the right to make a potion, etc.).  Schizophrenic fun.  

Due to the decision making in the roll-selection, wherein you're wondering if a subsequent player is going to trump you and if you should take the smaller reward, I would think this would play best with 4 or 5 players.

Let's not forget it's got the best character in Alea history: Rattles the Snake Charmer.

Played once with three players.  In this game players compete to be the one to make the most potions.  On each turn players can choose 5 of the 12 role cards to play (hopefully to get items, gold, or other good things).  Unfortunately, though, only one person can be a role on any turn; the game has a neat mechanic wherein after one person plays a role card the subsequent players _must_ play the role card if they have it, and then can choose either to get a lesser action (but be guaranteed to get the action) or to try to take the full action (causing the first person to play the card to not get anything, but then possibly losing the action to another player).

This leads to difficult decisions (both in terms of which 5 cards to choose, as well as how to play them), yet not so difficult that AP sets in or that the game drags on.  My first three player game was quite fun.

I hear this game has been "solved," so I decided to test this theory by going to the other extreme. Against four experience players, I drew my cards randomly for the first half the game. In the second half, I allowed myself to discard and replace cards I obviously couldn't use. And then I won. Does random + autopilot play even constitute a game? I dunno. Let's see how it fares against those who claim to have solved it.

I am not as certain there is enough information in the game to make any reasonable guesses, especially given the huge pool of possibilities.

Players select 5 roles out of 12 cards to brew potions and score points. The trick is that if you play your role card first, those who also chose that role and play after you can negate your role, to take it for themselves, or may let you keep your role. Lots of luck, with some decisions on whether to allow someone to keep their role. It`s fun, and good as a filler.

I consider this game as an interesting must-follow trick taking with some twist. Each player has identical 12 cards with 12 suits. Each round, you choose 5 out of 12 cards/suits. During the play you must follow the leading suit. If you don't have it, you simply pass. When you play, you can either fold or stay. If you fold, you immediately take a small benefit. If you are the LAST player staying, then you win the trick and take a big benefit. Otherwise, you don't get anything. Winner leads the next trick.

Clever game that is fun and deeper than it first seems.

Faidutti-ish game of bluffing and role selection.  Less screwage and needless frustration than I feared there'd be.  Likely to appeal to fans of Citadels, Fist of Dragonstones, and the overlooked Ruse & Bruise.  Julien Delval seems to be the go-to illustrator for these types of games.

Simultaneous action selection is hardly my favorite game mechanism, but here the bluffing and second guessing are layered enough that decisions become interesting, yet not so obtuse that they swing back toward just being lucky.

Finally learned this game last night and it really was a blast.  Very easy to pick-up and learn for the three friends I had with me and the game lasted a little over an hour.  I suspect the next time I bring this out, play could hardly go on for over 45 mins. 

I akin this game to Citadels a bit.  You all select 5 roles out of the 12 matching ones everyone has at their disposal.  Obviously each role gives you a different benefit.  After playing a role players have three options 1)pass (they do not have that role in thier 5 role cards), 2)challenge (take the top ability from the previous player, maybe getting it stolen from them), and 3)so being it (letting the previous player get the super power and also getting the lower ability to use).

Just like in Citadels noone exactly knew where to head and what roles to choose, but let me assure you, after you grasp what is going on a strategy will start emerging.  If strategy has not come to you after the first 2 laps, you are probably going to lose.

(I also own 6. player cards & expansions from "Alea/Rio Grande Chest")

It's a game where everyone selects 5 roles out of 12 and then roles are played. You can either try playing roles main action (better) or lesser action. Problem being that only the last player announcing main action gets to play it, lesser action you get surely. It's simple and quite elegant mechanic and I liked the game a lot. But I in general like these outguessing games and I know everyone doesn't. You want to play this game with 5 players as even 4 seems to be a bit too few. Actually I'm surprised that game doesn't have cards for the 6th player as I cannot see why game wouldn't work with 6 too.

Update: Expansion adds 6. player cards which is very good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Too chaotic for my taste: you suffer a lot from the turn order without any control on it (and amplified by the fact that with no cards in hand it goes to the player to the left). If you have one player playing quite randomly, the player to the left looses and the player to the right wins.
Nice design and ideas though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice, light role selection card game, with some outguessing included. 

We played a few rounds with the designer, who used the variant from the rulebook, along with some additional rules:
- When the winner of a trick runs out of cards and the next player becomes the new start player, he receives a compensation of 1 gold or 1 resource.
- Each player gets two (three with three players) tokens, each of which can be used once in a game to give you an action, if your card gets discarded when you are the start player.

The official variant is good for three players but not needed with four. With five players the game is very chaotic, so the tokens might be a good addition there. I don't think the compensation is really needed but I don't really care whether it is used or not.

This game feels better than it is.  I like the risk/reward of trying to take the role or minor benefit.

With 5 players I felt it was pretty much a glorified guessing competition. Did anyone to the left of me choose this role? If they did, will they want all the spoils and I'll get nothing? Or would they be willing to take a subset so as not to have to go first with the next play. Because going first in this game is a lock for getting nothing. Unpredictable rotation of start player usually upsets any plans as to what you'd like. So ... guess after guess and getting pus'd by turn order. Not a recipe for challenge or fun. It was however a lot better with 3 players, where actions of the other players were more predictable, and maybe 4 is the sweet spot. For the roles are interesting and there can be moments of satisfaction when things work out ok.

At five this game works great. You play a character and hope that no one else has it so that you get more resources in order to collect point cards. At three it still works but is a little less interesting as the main mechanic is to try and play a card that no one else has or guess what others are selecting to one up them. Still fun either way but better with more players.

I like that each player chooses five cards for each round and everyone has the same set of cards to choose from.

Though it may not look like it from the surface, this is really a simultaneous action selection game.  Everyone selects 5 cards at the beginning of each round, and if you select the same one as someone else, you may or may not be screwed, depending on a turn order you don't have much control over.  Not really much of a game here.

I hated to admit that this game really is good. I had lots of prejudices against the game for its role mechanic (you know I hate Citadels just so much...). Despite all that playing with roles stuff and Alea's logo, this really was a nice game.

We played with four players. The game sure is unforgiving. If somebody else plays the role later than you, that's it. The theme suits fine to the game and gives an elegant medieval touch to it. The flavour texts are good, they just could've been more concise.

The game itself is nice but a bit weird one to explain. I would play this again but didn't need to own this.

I guess this is a decent game, except playing it feels like a series of defeats.  "Okay, I'll be the druid -- what, you had the druid, too?  Guess I got screwed.  Well, I'll be the wizard -- oh no, someone else had the wizard!  I'm screwed again!"

And, I mean, this doesn't mean I'm doing poorly -- most players will get screwed at least once per round -- but psychologically the series of "I got screwed again" events meant I didn't have fun.

It plays quite fast and as soon as you think it's getting repetitive, it's over.  Annyone who is a fan of German games and trick-taking will love this clever and unique title from Alea.

First play with 5 of this quirky, (innovative?) non-numerical trick taking game in which you get to chose a batch of role cards from a set identical to everyone else.

Each role card has a strong ranking payoff or a weaker ranking payoff (either resources or vps). A player 'leads' with a role card declaring the stronger rank, with everyone following suit if they have the same role. Only 1 role card is allowed the strong payoff, whereas everyone in turn order can get the weaker benefits. So each player in turn either as to take a risk for the big gains or be 'trumped' and get nothing. So playing for seating order needs to be considered as does deducing what roles players may select from their holdings at the beginning of the round. 

As with most trick-taking games there is the fun upmanship and screwage, but despite being different it lacks the agony of having to decide what you need to discard in the standard numerical versions. However, Witch's Brew may be a keeper as the sweet spot is 4 and I like the headier deduction involved than say in Die Sieben Segel.

Witch's Brew features secret role selection, with players picking five from their (identical) sets of twelve actions at the start of a round. There's a push-your-luck element, as once a player has led a role that you've also selected, you can settle for an inferior version of the role or try for the full version at the risk of someone further round the table doing the same to you.

RATING: 6
Seems to work better with more players, while you are unable to execute your plan - I find being flexible the more interesting part of the game.

The game has a set collecting component - to get items to buy the cards when a role comes up. I find it not so much of bluffing game but has a trick taking element where you are trying to grab an action. Since sometimes you must collect before committing to the buy actions to get the order right can be difficult.

Each player has the same set of 12 roles and picks 5 which he wants to play at a time. This leads to some thought to be counter-cyclical. When in doubt just be random and see how it goes.

If you have the same role as the lead you can either "trump" their role and take the action for yourself or allow it to stand and take an action at an additional cost, sometimes that is better since you wouldn't have to lead in the next round.

A game where it is a disadvantage to go first.

Generally liked the art of the game - but the cauldrons where you can "buy" the victory points are very hard to distinguish from the role used to trigger the action.

The card drafting/hand selecting/card play mechanic seems to be unique and a good bit interesting.  But that carries this game only so far.  There's waaaay too much text on the cards and the icons are dreadful (the different colors of pots, e.g.).  It suffers from the "gotta be in the know" syndrome which I consider to be likely death for a game.  In other words, only when you know all the cards like the back of your hand will you be able to play quickly (building the five-card hand every turn) and with any sort of look-ahead abilities.  I don't like games with a long curve to mastery.  Go figure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Witch's Brew has simultaneous multiple role selection.  Most multiple role selection games do it with threaded selection of actions (think Caylus or Agricola).  In Witch's Brew all players pick their five actions for the round secretly.

In order to use a role you have to play the role card.  In turn order other players reveal whether they also chose that role.  If players did include that role they can either steal the start player's action, or take a lesser action.  If they choose to steal the action a subsequent player may be able to steal it from them.

So you get a game where you are trying to predict which five actions the other players have chosen.  Then you are trying to control who the start player is, so you can go last each hand.  It feels like a trick taking game in a way in that you are trying to give control to other players.

The game is about collecting ingredients for various kinds of potions.  So the ingredients people have is some kind of an indicator for what they may pick.  Also, there are roles that steal money and ingredients from other players.  So there are several indicators about what other players might pick.  Often times it helps to get out of sync with the other players in order to minimize the amount of overlap between your cards and theirs.  Other times you want to pick a card others might pick for defensive purposes.  You may want even want to pick a throw-away card when you end up leading hoping another player will take the action from you so they will have to start the next play.

Overall Witch's Brew is a fun and original game of bluff and simultaneous action selection combined with a fun economic engine.

RATING: 7.5
I had a good time playing this game. There's a certain amount of "OHHHH!!!!" that happens about 2/3 of the way through your first game where you start to see more of the underlying strategy of role picking. Sometimes you aren't gunning for what you want, but what you think you can burn through to make sure you CAN get to what you want.

I worry about playing this with one of our group though. I don't think those with AP problems will be able to cycle through the role selection quickly.

Love the game, since I like double guessing and bluff. There's enough information out there to know what your opponents will *probably* play, and the tactical play is great too as everyone tries to avoid playing first, but making sure they have the big guns in hand when playing last.

I like getting plenty of money and then playing all three potion cards. Vital to be able to say "so be it" but still able to make potions with two coins.

Severely regret not buying it when it was in print.

I think this is best on full number of players. Good fun card game of brwing potions. Choose your characters for the round & try to get win the characters card reward. Only one player can have the reward so it's knowing when to stake a claim 'I am the ...' or accept the 'So be it' option.

It takes some time to see the strategy, but it's all about guessing what you're opponent's goal is and profiting off of it. You also must always weigh the consequences of claiming a role, since being first player is a very weak position. Overall, Witch's Brew is one of my favorite light/filler games. Fun with just about any crowd. Even better with the expansion.

Fun but does seem very random. The gimmick of role choice is nice, and there is some ability to get in people's heads. But getting in 4 other people's heads is a bit too hard, and too much precision is required. I think Adel Verflichtet is more fun for the same line of country.

Card game for 3+. Similar to Havana in resource card simultaneous selection, but with an element of bluffing and turn order to determine who gets to use a given resource card when multiple players play the same one. Gem acquisition and potion brewing. Seems a bit random and too much reliant on turn order.

A clever fun but rather chaotic game (possibly too chaotic for its length). The central mechanism is: pick 5 of your 12 role cards to use in a round. Then in sequential order we reveal our cards of a given role if we have them, saying if we want to be that role (risking that a later person with the card will steal the role from us) or say "so be it" and use the secondary power of the card. Nifty. Attractive bits.

This was another big surprise for me at Gamefest South. I normally do not like light hearted games, but this game actually has some decisions that matter and you have fun doing it. I cannot count how many times the group laughed out loud during the game. And I played it twice.

This is a game, though, where it plays well with only certain players. If someone doesn't enjoy it, the game won't go well.

--Mar2011-- I'm a curmudgeon, I know; but this one is too far along the Blind Bidding spectrum for me to enjoy it wholeheartedly.  Yes, there are a few mitigating factors to the bidding (so it might work, with practice.)  But while a novice, and in the presence of other novices, one will be blocked [i]inadvertently[/i] by one's peers - and that's a turnoff to me.  It looks to me like one wins if one (semi-randomly) chooses the path that collides least with ones colleagues.  Collision games can work (Balderdash, for example) when the set from which the items can be selected is large and the number of items selected isn't fixed.  But it's not a mechanism that I enjoy against a fixed finite set.

I am becoming a big fan of double think games and this one really hit it's mark for me.  Role selection (or card selection here) is only half the battle and you still have options when it comes to converting your cards into points.  I think the theme is well done and the Rattles card can be hilarious in the right group.

Fiddle with a bunch of resources, then see who has the most victory points at the end. Has the "publicly increment a variable, but declare the current value secret" thing going, which is as annoying and pointless as ever. We played this game with four people, and it just couldn't seem to keep anyone's interest - side conversations instead of taking turns was rampant. 

Not a bad game per se, but when you have a wealth of options, why own a game that has no compelling strengths?

Maybe I've become jaded, and if I didn't have much experience to draw from I might really like this game, but sadly I just think it's alright. What I like about it is the risk taking - push your luck element - where you can guess/estimate your chances that another player further along has the same card, and you can elect to benefit a little bit while allowing the earlier player to carry the risk. (That sentence actually made sense in my head.) I like the card choices you can make at the beginning of a round and how sometimes you can make some rather clever choices. However, the problem with the game for me hinges on two things: 1. The theme is completely "blah". I just don't care about witches and their whatever. 2. Turn order. I could be considered clever the way the turn order dictates a lot of your decisions, but it's just a 95% luckfest in a five player game IF you'll be lucky enough to go last in any given round. Sure, if you win you'll go first, and then the following round the chance will be high that you'll go second or third, but something about it just grates me. Mainly though, I'm over the witches tacked on theme - and hence why I'm jaded - I'm losing my tolerance for tacked on themes with games that have quite decent mechanics - I feel like disliking the game even more because they missed the opportunity to give it a really good theme.

Witch's Brew is really a fun game, with lots of laughters and lots of gambling...
But the problem is, there is far too few control. Too many elements are beyond the possible anticipations... not only who else took this card, but also in which order will they be played?
It's very frustrating, because I really feel that we are not far from a great game... except for that and for the ugly theme.

As a general rule, I try to play all of the new Alea games at least once and usually buy them first.  Somehow, this game slipped beneath my radar and I was never able to add it to my collection.  I have, however, played the game.  Unfortunately, it is a style of game that I am not particularly good at -- those games where you have to carefully pick your battles.  An element of second-guessing seems to only make this more difficult for me.  Still, I found it to be a pleasant enough game with lots going on.  Unfortunately, it seems to suffer (as do most of these type games) from players who do not really pay much attention or make much effort at good play.  That decreases the attractiveness somewhat.  Still, overall, I was happy with the experience and would willingly play again.  I would even add it to my collection -- if it were ever available when I place an order. [12/29/2009]

Witch's Brew -- Clever, chaotic, tactical, and fun.  

•Clever: The main mechanism — simultaneous role selection, followed by sequential play.
•Chaotic:  Which roles are selected, and who will win their effects is highly (but not wholly) unpredictable.
•Tactical:  The order in which cards are played is pivotal.  Not just because you need the effects of one card to gain the effects of another.  There's also the matter of retaining a role you've played.  When you have to lead a card, it may be best [i]not[/i] to lead a card whose effect is important to you.  You might want to wait for someone else to play it, so you can guarantee you get at least its Favor.
•Fun:  Whether a player announces he'll take a role ("I am Rattles, the Snake Hunter.") or a Favor ("So be it."), it's almost always a fun moment.  If you take someone's role, only to have it taken from you, there's much groaning and laughter.  If you choose the Favor, and a later player takes the role, you have elation of knowing you chose correctly.  If, on the other hand, no later player takes the role, everyone else rejoices in your failed caution. 

I'm very tempted to buy this.  Problem is, two of the cauldron symbols are almost indistinguishable, requiring too much attention when selecting cards.  Also, while I like that the requirements for purchasing cauldrons and shelves increase over the course of the game, I think their corresponding victory point values increase too much.  For example, in our first game, the player in last place won the game with the purchase of a single card.  While this keeps everyone in the running, it makes an already chaotic game even more chaotic.  

Still, this scratches the itch for a game with the attributes of Citadels (character powers, uncertain role selection and light gameplay) but provides more ways to use your resources to collect victory points.

[i]Update 03 July 2009:[/i] I went ahead and bought a copy.  The game's fun factor trumped its minor issues.

RATING: 5
Witch's Brew is a game which I had a blast playing when it was first introduced to me in the early days of my hobby. Unlike most games in its genre, picking the same cards as your opponents is actually the [i]fun[/i] part because you have to second-guess whether the other players down the line are likely to clash with you. There’s even a bit of tactics involved in positioning yourself to be later in line.  

As Witch's Brew is as good as long as it gimmick lasts, there are times when the game drags to a finish. Another issue is that it fails the [i]random draw[/i] test - a player who randomly draws a hand could end up on par with a player who puts thought into the pick. This is because getting the correct sequence of actions is decidedly less important here than in say, Glass Road or Broom Service.

Played this once with 6P using Magic Powers from the Alea Treasure Box expansion. The effects of Magic Powers and the method of drafting them are interesting and often influence the roles players pick. However, as it adds another phase to every round, it does prolong the game noticeably beyond the average length of a filler game.

RATING: 8.5
Fantastically clever trick-taking game melded with the sheer fun of role selection. There's abit of citadels in there.

Players each select 5 cards (out of 12) to play each turn. A player leads with a card. Each downstream player with the same card in hand HAS to play the card and either trump it for a huge reward or allow the leader to trump in exchange for a smaller reward.

Ultimately, players are trying to use abilities on cards to gather ingredients to buy cards with VP on them. Most VP wins.

Very tightly meshed mechanics, decent theme, meaty filler. I like it.

Only downside are the illustrations and colours and wording on cards. The roles don't match the title of the card. The player declares the role (IE: I am the Cut Purse) but the card might say Thief. Leads to much confusion. Also, colourblind players will struggle to differentiate between green and red symbols.

Still, top points for this one!

Wonderful psychological, blind bidding game.  The novel mechanic here is that if you think no else has chosen your role, you declare the primary use of that role, getting its powerful action.  However, if anyone else does have that role, they trump you and you get no ability.  You can instead to play it safe and get the lesser role.  I much prefer this to Citadels for its faster and less nasty play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Feels like a cross between Citadels and a trick-taking game, except I like those games. This one is simple. First players choose five roles from identical hands of 12. Then they play their cards one role at a time, always following with the role that was led. Typically the last person to play the role gets the benefit and gets to lead the next role, although there's some bluffing/betting involved with that too. The roles enable players to get resources or convert resources into victory points. I don't like the simultaneous action selection; I don't like the blind betting; and I don't like the powerful turn/seating order effects. I felt like I was playing the game in a straightjacket created by the designer. What I was allowed to do wasn't fun.

This is a fun little set-collection guess-what-they're-going-to-pick card game. You have some control in that you get to pick your own personal set of action cards, but there is plenty of player-related chaos. To do well, I think you need to figure out what the others are likely to choose, choose something else, _and_ make that generate victory points.

--- Summary ---
There are 6 piles of cards, each requiring a different action card (players all have the same set of cards from which they choose 5 to play each round) and various combinations of ingredients (coins or one of 3 ingredient tokens). Starting player picks and reveals an action card, which gives them a greater reward (e.g., take 3 ingredients). Then, in clockwise order, players either pass (if they don't have that card), or play the same card and accept a lesser reward (e.g., take 1 ingredient), or play the card for the greater reward (nullifying the previously played card/player). Some cards allow you to take cards from the center -- each stack is arranged with higher-VP cards at the bottom. The game ends when 4 cards with the raven symbol have been won, with the player with the highest VP sum winning the game.

Bluffing and variable card powers are two of my favorite mechanics, as long as the card powers aren't overly confusing.  Here they combine for a really fun game that is fairly easy to learn, doesn't take too long, and has a ton of interaction.  I think it would play well with four or five players, whereas three wouldn't be quite as fun, although I still wouldn't mind giving it a try. I'm surprised at how low it's rated so far.  Good stuff!

-Little to no downtime due to fast rounds.
-Rewards strategic card selection and role selection.

-Turn order can really make a difference in the outcome of the game.

TL;DR: Fast, fun, card game that will reward (punish?) bold moves and often cause laughter.

played with both 3 and 4 players and it is quite fun with either, though I would lean toward 4.  The one time we played with 5 we found it a little too chaotic, and with 3 it's not quite chaotic enough because you can look at each other's resources and usually guess what people *won't* choose.  Which seems to lead to two of the players being quite close in score, and the other player being substantially behind.

Why people like games like this where you lose almost all control as you max out on the number of players is beyond me.  I suppose if you like games with little strategic play (which is already limited in this game) and little tactical play (which is brutally cutthroat at 3 here, and balanced at 4), where you simply make a best guess and just take whatever is left to you, go for the 5-player game.  But if you like being able to win due to your ability, rather than simply luck based on player-driven-chaos, then avoid 5!

[RGG 'Witch's Brew' 08 edition] {Wizard; double-guessing, trick-taking; optimal 5p} I usually enjoy double-guessing games.  So, I bought it based on my buddies' recommendations without giving a try.  I believe I would enjoy this one.  It doesn't fail me.  It's a good and clever game - fast-paced, fun, interactive, and tactical.  It's easy to learn even without a persuasive theme.  It is accessible for general players but I think it's more suitable for experienced gamers.

It is a very tactical game.  Players have to choose the 5 roles carefully and decide wisely whether to claim the favor / full action.  It is a resources management game - players have to efficiently convert their available resources to VPs.  A game is short; therefore, players shall not allow themselves fall behind too much in the first few turns; otherwise, it will be difficult to catch up.  Every decision counts in this game!

The components are of good quality but it's a little pricey for what it provides.  The wooden drops are interesting but they are too small; they should have similar size as the Goa's spices.  The cards are nicely illustrated. The cardstock is thick enough.  The information on the cards is helpful.  A minus is that the light blue cards do not tell that players can pay additional ingredients to get a potion vial.  It'd be perfect if wooden bits of golden nuggets and potion vial are provided.  And, there are typos and errors in the rulebook!!  Finally, I have to complain the box is larger than necessary! (but still better than Race for the Galaxy.)

Card-based game where the object is to use different characters to acquire ingredients, gold and potions. The trick to the game is balancing when to play your character's main skill (which you might lose the right to use) or to use their secondary skill (which you cannot lose). You also need to ensure you have the correct ingredients that correspond with the cards you want to acquire, so quite a lot of careful planning needs to take place and there's a lot more depth to the decisions you have to make than would at first appear. It's basically an exercise in calculated risk taking. The rules are very quick to pick up and the visual look of the game is also quite appealing.

German edition with English sixth player expansion cards to replace the language dependent parts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A pleasant surprise. Pick 5 role cards from 12 and then decide which order to play in. You then have to guess/deduce whether your opponents have picked the same cards.

Well worth trying/trading for and so much more (game) than I was expecting.

Update: this game always results in lots of laughs and, with our group, lots of Indiana Jones references advising players that "You have chosen... Poorly." and lots of terrible French accents (for Herbie the Herb Collector). It sometimes runs a little long and the 6 player game seemed to solve this. When it doesn't overrun, it's a great little game.

Update: Wolfi the wolf keeper has also been elevated, gaining a very camp, playful yet seductive German accent. Rattles has also become a cockney and Drood Glaswegian. YMMV.

Rating up from 7.4 to 8.

I enjoyed this light bluffing type game very much.  I've only played it once, with five, so I am unsure about its scalability or how it does in different social situations, but I'm very interested in trying it more.

If you get a chance to give it a shot, I would suggest doing so.

Update: I've played this many more times.  It is definitely better with more players, but it plays just fine with other numbers too, I'll happily play with any number from 4 to 6.  It's a different kind of game.  Not many other games are like it at all.

I really enjoy getting this game out.  There is certainly some luck involved so don't go in thinking that if you are the best player you are guaranteed to win.  But it is light, fun, and great with the right crowd.  IMHO this is 5 player only for me.  I would certainly not do it with 3, and even 4 would not be optimal.

A lighter offering very much in keeping with the depth, length and complexity of Edel, Stein & Reich, another title in the Alea medium-box series. Plenty of room for stragegy amid the bluffing, although there is a healthy dose of luck that's inevitable in the role selection process here. Overall, this one strikes a nice balance, playing quickly and still giving players plenty to think about and mulitple paths to victory.

Games always get higher marks from me if they tend towards more noisy interaction.  Witch's Brew, though the theme is odd, is a good game that has small layers of strategy hiding beneath its goofy premise.  Played 2 games the first night, and would have played another right away.  Highly recommended for interaction combined with sneaky strategy.

I really liked this game, but I think I really liked it because we had a full complement of players.

Still, if it were possible to get it cheap I'd probably grab it just in case.

Witch’s Brew is #4 in the Alea medium box series of games. It’s only the second member of the Alea medium box series that I’ve tried, the other being Louis XIV, which is in my Top 20, although both Palazzo and Augsburg 1520 are on my list to try. In fact, Augsburg 1520 is the game that BGG most recommends based on my existing 504 ratings, so I suppose I do need to give it a shot sometime soon. Witch’s Brew is a role selection game where players simultaneously and secretly select a hand of five role cards out of a possible twelve. These role cards will give you potion drops, money, let you spend potion drops to buy cauldrons full of potions (worth victory points), or various other special abilities. In each round, one player leads by playing a role card, then clockwise each player must play that same role card if they had selected it as one of their five for that round. When playing the same role card as someone else, you have to decide whether to take a diminished reward or whether to claim the full reward. If you claim a diminished reward then you’re guaranteed receiving it, but if you attempt to claim the full reward then you are thwarted (and receive nothing) if anyone after you plays the card and claims the full reward. It has some interesting decisions as to how risk averse or risk preferring you’d like to be, but it’s also very random in terms of what roles each player selects each round and the order in which those roles come out, as well as where you happen to be sitting in the circle. It’s not quite short enough in relation to its randomness. If it could get down to 30 minutes or less then it might be in about the right proportion, but coming in at 50-60 minutes, it dragged a bit towards the end. It would probably be quicker with experienced players, and I’d be willing to play it again, but as for it being in the same series as Louis XIV, there’s a clear winner in that bout.

Alea Medium Box #4. I bought on ebay before it came out in the US, then contacted its creator for English rules, ultimately rewording and posting them here in the files section.  Less useful now that the English version has come out.  I like this game, it can be great fun! We kind of like playing the German version best, calling out the names in that language is fun in itself for we who speak no German at all.  I've played the English version, and it's exactly the same.  The game really works very well, and everybody always seems to have a lot of fun! Plus, it's short, so good for a quick starter or light filler.

English edition of Alea Medium Box #4 - Wie Verhext. Played, and is the same game without the cool German names.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wie verhext is an original family game with great artwork, and gameplay that is both tactical (role selection, risk management) and chaotic (risk taking). Somehow, its individual parts make for a much better game than one might expect after reading the (well-written) manual. First time I played it, when I played it with four seasoned gamers, the game finished in little more than an hour, and everybody liked it. If you are looking for an easily explained, original game that makes you laugh/shout/bite your nails every once in a while, look no further. Not one for the analysts though.
UPDATE: Rating lowered after playing with five casual gamers (using the Schatzkiste 6th player expansion). I found that the game can be difficult to explain to casual gamers, and the general feeling in the group was that victory can only be achieved by lucky guesses. An entirely different sentiment from my previous plays with hardcore gamers. I can only conclude that the game only really shines with the right group in the right mood. And that it does require some concentration in order to be appreciated fully (i.e. it shouldn't be approached as a party game).

Witch's Brew is a combination of simultaneous action selection melded with elements of blind bidding to accrue resources in order to gain victory points. Each player has a similar number of set cards in which only five are selected each round to put into play. Players then play cards sequentially and if similar actions/cards are selected across the board from different players, only one will get to play the characters and gain the benefits. Bluffing is certainly one aspect of the game but the innovative mechanism here is that instead of risking a winner-take-all approach, each card also has a "lesser power" in which the person who chickens out can choose to invoke that diminished role.

A pretty entertaining and relatively quick game but not without flaws. The strength and also weakness of the game lies in the simultaneous action selection and blind bidding process. One can get terribly behind if your choices constantly clashed with others. So luck plays a large role in the game. However, the more disturbing aspect of the game is the rather limited set of cards to choose from in the first and final rounds. The first round, the commodity cards became very valuable while the begger/thief cards were generally passed over. The flip side then occurs in the last round where the commodity cards aren't as useful while the potion brewing characters were heavily contested. The game itself was light and quite fun in the sense that all players were engaged and the tension was palpable as each character was revealed. On the other hand, the weaknesses I described above were really evident and anticipated. Perhaps minor rule changes such as awarding points for leftover reagents at the end of the game or starting with more money in the beginning may help diversify role selection throughout the game.

This is one of those weird games where, just when you think you've figured out the trick, you realize that you still don't have it, and you're scrambling to recover the turn that you thought you had perfectly planned out.  At least, that's what happened to me on my first game, when I banked my entire turn on getting to use the ability of my Wolf's Blood dude, and then lost it all together.  It turns out that going first isn't really a good position to be in at the start of a round.

There's a little bit of Citadels here, but not a whole lot.  I can see the comparisons, but it's still its own game, which is a good thing, and the manipulation of the cards and abilities to get what you want out of the game is tricky, and reminiscent of manipulating the markets in Jambo.  It's definitely a game to play more than once to get a true feel for how it develops.  I'm looking forward to that second play.

Not sure if this is just theme or what, but this completely replaced Citadels for us.

My wife HATES citadels (I happen to like it quite a bit for a filler) but she has embraced Witch's Brew completely. I dont' know if it is the little potion bits or just the art/theme but regardless I'll take it! It is more complex and less swingy than Citadels but has a lot of similarities with the role selection. 

Really fun game!

Pick all the best roles so you get more bang for your buck. But everybody's doing it! So pick the roles that aren't quite as lucrative. Oh, everybody's doing that too? How about we infer what the people to the right of us DON'T need and then pick those roles, because surely - surely! - they won't pick Herbie Hancock when they have greens already. Of course, we don't need greens either, so where does that leave us? Hoping for perfect timing where the guy to the left leads kickass yellow roles that we also selected so we snag the guaranteed payout? Only real constant is the worthless cutpurse, who's never an issue because money is primarily made and spent in same turn from "so be it"-ing Alchemist, Fortune Teller, and the various blues. So that's one fewer possibility in the chaotic struggle to pick different roles than other people. Great.

decently interesting role-selection card game, with a good though thin theme.  the art is wonderful, and gameplay is fun.  there is a great strategy in selecting your set of cards for each turn, and in when to "pass" or "play".

8.5 after 2 plays.

High player interaction coupled with low downtime makes for a very fun game. Close observation of other players' gold and ingredients is required when selecting roles. Also need to keep tabs on the number of crows for the game end condition. 

Minor complaint about the colours of the brews not being as obvious as it should be.

kind of like Glass Road without the building part, just the simultaneous action selection... a little push-your luck and out-guessing with a cool potion making theme...

Great with 5, don't play with less. It was developed into a family friendly game - although an early prototype (3 plays) was kinda brainburny and really great. Sad...

Witch's Brew may have been designed as a filler, but I actually do think there is quite a bit going on in this little game.  It is true that a lot of guess work is involved.  However, since player's resource is open information, as well as what victory point cards are available, so it is still feasible to deduce the roles your opponents may be selecting from round to round.  Then there is the jockey for play order.  Going first is obviously a disadvantage.  Therefore, you have to manipulate yourself to the last position to really reap the benefit of what you've chosen.

With that said, here lies the dilemma for Witch's Brew.  On the one hand people expect this to be a relatively fast game to play.  On the other, with as many as 12 roles available, this could drag on in the wrong hands.  I also did not find it appealing that a role can still be selected and played even if you cannot fulfill the power it granted.  I don't think a "take that" element is necessary in a title such as this, even unintentionally.

Fun little filler, definitely worthwhile.  Plays far better with 5 than with 3/4.

Needs better names for the cards.

It was a lot more fun than I'd guess for a member of the greater blind role selection family, mainly because players after the lead player can choose to piggy-back safely, rather than steal the privilege and risk all.  Not bad!

Furthermore, this is improved by the 3 expansions in [thing=40688][/thing].  (One just adds a 6th player and some play-easing components, but the second adds amulets that decrease the forgone conclusions at the end of each role played, and the third adds a draft of a special ability for each round.)

After 1 Play: Turn order can be very important but is nearly impossible to control.  While the game is a bit too chaotic for my taste it is still fun.

Okay game as a light filler. I enjoyed the designer suggested variant with two stones to 'force your way' - it adds some control, which is needed.

We like this one because we - whose native language is dutch - tend to talk some pseudo-german during this game.

Emphasizes fun, risk-taking, and cool little powers (three things I really like). The game isn't very strategic/tactical but it has a good amount of interaction and plays quickly. Four players might be better than five, but that's speculation at this point.

Edit: No, both four and five are great. Three, however, is certainly not as good.

Own the expansion.

Todos seleccionan 5 de 12 roles. Luego el jugador inicial juega un rol. Si alguien más lo tiene puede quedarse con el "favor" o declarar que EL es ahora dueño del rol. Deducción y push your luck.

Great 3 player trick taking.  It's too hard to remember all the special scoring though.  It always takes me a few games to get used to it again.

Trick-taking for 3 par excellance. Some of the special powers are admittedly less interesting than others. I find myself hoping one of the ridiculous game-changing ones are in the game.

RATING: 9.5
A normal card deck, weird counting, superpowers, cards that change the rules, this game has everything. At first it seems crazy, but it is a great game, despite the bizarre rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fine three-player card game belonging to the Jass family.  The scoring system, with its differing rewards if one player is forced over 100 points, is really quite clever.  It demands a careful assessment of your hand and a constant awareness of what the other players are doing. The deck artwork is amusing but a little confusing, the arithmatic a little taxing.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This one needs repeated plays with the same group. It suffers from being a riff on Jass, so many of its base quirks need to be internalized before the variable player powers can gel with the heart of the game.

Still a great 3-only game.

Once you get over the rule-jungle, its a nice cardgame with lots of twistes. Unfortunately its a bit of an effort to understand the game. You need two other players who are willing to learn the game well.

RATING: 10
Wow. Just... wow. I love this game.

I have reservations about giving any game a 10. I'd *never* turn down a game? I can think of times when I wouldn't want to play Cosmic Eidex. For example, were I hiding from an axe-wielding maniac who'd been chasing me through a dusty old mansion, trying to make some kind of maniac-distracting device from the bric-a-brac found in a mad scientist's laboratory, and a brain in a jar and a hyperintelligent rat challenged me to a game of Cosmic Eidex, I might have to decline.

I'd have to think about it, though.

This has become my family's 3-player "let's play one hand" game.  If we're only playing one or two hands we usually don't bother with the powers.  But the game is fun without it.  Lots to consider.

I'd say it's generally better to try to go low, but that's hard because most people do.  So, defecting and going high earlier is also real good, so long as people don't then push you over 100.  Lots of balancing.  Then add in the no-trump and reverse games and it keeps keeping you on your toes.

While we aren't generally playing to 6, adding in the special powers is a neat diversion and the 2v1 play when someone is at 5 is neat as well.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good trick taking game for 3.  I don't rate it higher at this point because I think it is needlessly complex with all of the different player powers and the potential interactions.  I think Skat is more elegant, though I enjoy the cardplay of CE more...having to be high or low but not in the middle on trick points.

Great trick taking game for exactly three players. Maybe the best in that respect? It does have a pretty steep learning curve (the scoring system especially will put off new players) but it's definitely worth the initial confusion... the game really shines when you can get the same group of people to play it regularly and really get to know its intricacies. What makes it so great is it's one of the most unique trick taking games around. The variable player powers, VP system, and three different ways to play a hand add up to one of the most unique trick taking experiences I've had.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What an inventive and interesting trick game for 3.  Seems best without the special player powers and just playing by the rules, which are already enough to try to handle.  An incredible and highly replayable game.

Played three games and they all felt so completely different with the new powers every game.  This game is a lot of fun.  Tichu is my 4 player card game of choice as this is my three-player.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
This was Mike VB's "I want to show Martin that I own stranger games than Alex" game, a variant of a Swedish trick-taking game that has more exceptions than rule.  Did I mention that there are also special powers?  It seems fun, somewhat confusing for a trick-taking game, but not quite overly complicated.  (I don't like my trick-taking games to be more complicated than 3-hour board games. :P)

Made wooden components, one tile for each special power (ie, draw it from a bag), and wooden aids with up-down and down-up scoring charts.  Now I need just two wooden (or regular) people to play it. Hmmmm, how am I going to manage that?

I've never cared for [GAMEID=11330], but this variant is definitely better. A very portable trick-taker for three that offers more variety and feels less luck-driven than the original. Not sure how much I like the quirky scoring mechanism and if the 36 different powers are all equally interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
There are an incredible amount of things to wrap your head around in this game...from the way the game can change from "standard" Eidex to top down and bottom up and the unconventional base play (can throw trumps even if you still have cards in a suit, but can never be forced to play the highest trump if you don't want to) and this is even without mentioning the incredible number of special powers.

This game will absolutely overwhelm even the most experienced card player the first time or two out, but if you can get in a few games with the same trio then it can really start to shine as there are an amazing amount of different (and subtle) ways to approach the game because of the "highest and lowest each score a point" system and the ways the special powers can interact within that context. 

If you're looking for some extremely meaty trick taking fun with fantastic art look no further, but I do not recommend this for anyone who is not willing to play the game quite a few times with the same crowd. This is mainly because the game by itself, is pretty difficult to learn, even without the special power factor, and with it it is very tough. I highly recommend the handy player aids available here in any case.

I started this game at an 8 rating. It then moved up to a 9 and broke into my top 10. Now it's a 10 (after having received over 48 hours of play and maintaining a 9 rating) and is in my top 5. This is a very, very good 3 player game for people who like heavier options and it is currently one of my real go-to games in both my regular gaming groups, and with my card game loving friends.

This has a fairly steep learning curve, but it is definitely worth the time investment. Best played with rotating play order (like all 3 player trick-taking games) so players don't have to continually follow or play before the same person.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only played it a few times. Interesting twist on trick-taking game. The real shine seems to be with the special abilities, which I haven't got very deep into. Plays with only and exactly 3, which is not common for me, at least at this length. Usually we go for Bottle Imp, only because it's easier to explain if someone doesn't know. Need to make an effort to play this more.

The game comes highly recommended as THE best three-player card game, but the rules set is quite intimidating.  I don't care for games where you need a flow chart to figure things out.  Maybe this is someone else's cup of tea.  Sold it to Joss Ives.

An odd trick-taking game, but very fun.  This is one game where I liked the odd hand goal of either having the most points but less than 100, or having the least points.  Only one play was using the powers, and I still liked it, though the powers we used were rather uneven.

Tough one to rate.  I like the game, but the rules are just so convoluted that I can't see getting it to the table that often.  There's just too many weird deviations from a normal card game.  On top of the weird scoring are the special powers for each player.  Too much.

RATING: 8
Rating may rise. It's 3-player Sheepshead with a lot of great house rules thrown in. First is a clever victory threshold, wherein if one player gets too many points he loses. But if not then the players who score lowest and highest win! This keeps the game exciting up until the last few tricks! 
 
The other amazing feature is that there are 32 "special powers", a la Cosmic Encounter, that allow you to break a rule or change a parameter of the game. This keeps the game fresh with a ton of possibilities!

RATING: 9
Trippy, brain-melting trick-taking card game for 3, with a high amount of variability and even some special powers which will keep you on your toes throughout.  The game has enough wonky scoring and special circumstances to make the first play a bit uneasy (but still plenty of fun) but makes me want to come back for more.   I can see this surpassing Bottle Imp due to the variability which that game can't match.   You could play with a regular deck of cards, but the art here is wild and unique enough to make it worth having.

Fun little 3 player card game.  It normally wouldn't come close to other favorite trick taking card games which use standard decks of cards, however the cosmic powers really add quite a bit of variety and flavor, and the scoring rules are interesting and unique.  The artwork on the cards is cool as well.  I love that it's designed specifically for 3 players.

Not sure about the mixed-up suit order and card values, although it certainly creates some confusion that brings back memories of cosmic encounter.

If I didn't know Cosmic Eidex was based on an actual traditional card game upon having the rules explained I would have thought: traditional card game satire! To be honest, I'm still not sure it really isn't. Put all the crazy, weird, and incomprehensible rules of the traditional games in a blender, and then add some more silliness on top, just because you can. Or something like that.

Without a background in trick-taking games it probably is incomprehensible. Nevertheless, all those little rules make sense fairly quickly once you start playing, and the game provides a reasonable, if seemingly a little more arbitrary experience - unless, and this is my biggest gripe, you are a heavy card counter. Cosmic Eidex is what card counter heaven must be like. I do feel a little out of place there.

A very enjoyable twist to trick-taking games. The basic mechanic works well and random special abilities make sure that every game is different. Because of different ways of scoring points, Cosmic Eidex also seems to require more reactive way of playing than other trick-taking games: if the hand does not go according to your original plan, you can still turn the situation around by cleverly adapting and changing your approach.

Hard to do better for three-player trick taking.  There is a *lot* to think about here.  Although chaos abounds, the game never feels out of control, and there seems to be plenty of room for skillful play.  The game manages to maintain a zany, lighthearted feel despite being something of a brain-burner.  Keeps getting better and better with each play!

this one finally came my way.  I was the newbie and screwed up a couple of core rules but we got it worked out.  This is a must have for me to have for 3-player game options.  Trick taking game with 4 suits and 36 cards for 3 players only.  Base game uses a combination of points for taking tricks and victory points.  At the end of each hand, you total up your points.  The player with the highest score and the player with the lowest score each get one victory point.  There are several exceptions to this rule, but that is the basic scoring mechanism.  Game has lots of game play, and scoring corner cases that I won't go into here.  And that's without adding in the characters.  Each card has a character that gives a special ability.  If playing with characters, at the beginning of each hand, three cards are turned over in front of each player that tells that player which character they are.  The character will give you an ability such as, 'you can refuse a trick if it has a queen and either king or jack in it.'

A little too long for my taste, but I really liked the scoring system. Perfect for a three-player trick taking game. A bit odd that it is sold as a card game when it would easily be playable with a deck of cards. There are better trick-taking games out there in the sense that they provide just as much strategy without the need for so much counting. Trying to remember your total points taken is tough, even with a player aid. But the game itself is pretty solid.

RATING: 7
Cosmic Eidex is a revisiting of Minus-Plus Jass, with a special one-time player power which adds some flair.

Basically, players are playing a short deck trick taking game, with trumps (mostly), and are trying to either take the fewest points in cards or the most- but they must not exceed a total of 100 points, unless they take every trick.

There are some usual Germanic changes in rank of Trump cards (e.g., Bauer highest), and some different rules regarding when they are permitted to trump/required to trump.

In addition, each card has a name and an individual power, usable only once per game.

I like card games, Euchre among them, and found the rules changed to be refreshing in this game. Hopefully I will be able to get some three-hand games going with this one.

First played this on May 2nd, 2007.  After the rules explaination, I had the feeling that there were way too many quirks with this game for what it was worth.  Keep in mind that I'm familar with a lot of trick taking games.  Once we got into it, it was pretty good and I enjoyed myself.  It does also seem to drag on a bit after you are playing it for a while.  I'd recommend giving it a gameplay if you are familar with trick taking games, however this probably shouldn't be your first.  If you are into trick taking games, this one is great to try out if your looking for another one to play.

Rating based on two "tournaments". It was difficult to remember the card scoring, but I'm sure it would become second nature after a few plays. The victory point scoring seems strange at first glance, but this is what made the game interesting as its less about having a 'good' hand and more about adapting your play to the hand you have and to your opponents' tactics. I'm still undecided about how much the cosmic characters add to the game; in one tournamemt they didn't play much of a role, but in the other they added a little extra to the game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2012)

Cosmic Eidex is a weird meaty game. I bought it because I love trick taking games and I don’t have a 3 player only game. At first it appeared I made a mistake buying it, the game was very chaotic and it seemed to have lots and lots of luck (which it doesn’t). However, now I’m beginning to appreciate the game, and I expect its rating will go up with further plays.

The rules are fairly complex for a trick taking game but they are not that hard to grasp, they are somewhat hard to explain to new players. I think the game has a steep learning curve, I consider myself a veteran card player, but still, it took some plays for me to grasp the game (I don’t think I have fully grasped it yet) which I like a lot. It seems there is plenty of room for skill and strategy, however most times it still eludes me :/. It seems I suck at this game but this is a plus as I tend to play more the games in which I´m very bad (if I like them enough obviously :)).

What I most like about Cosmic Eidex, is that no matter the hand you were dealt, you can always turn it to your advantage (as the game rewards the player with the more and fewest points), also I really like the fact that if you pass over 100 points you automatically lose so you need to know more or less how many points do you have. This can make the game a little mathy but it is a blast. 

The art is pretty cool, however some cards are not clearly recognizable by the art alone at first glance. In all my games with new players, someone was confused about some card. The game variability is great, as each time you play there are different “powers” in play that can change dramatically the rules.

Each round plays pretty quickly, but as you need to get to 7 victory points, it can take a while.

A print aid that depicts the confusing (at first) scoring is a must.

For me, it has the potential to be the best trick taking card game out there, a gamer´s game trick taking game, BUT it is not for everyone, most of my friends dislike the game. Try it (at least 3 times ) before you buy it.

I will try to play this with the same two friends who like it to form a better opinion.

It took me a long time to play Cosmic Eidex again. The truth of the matter is that I have changed a lot in this period of time. I no longer love trick taking games, so my desire to play Cosmic Eidex is low at best. I was going to sell the game, but after playing it, I decided to keep it for now. It is a weird game and I want to play it again in the future. I downgraded its rating nonetheless.

I'm terrible at this but I still find it very interesting.  Update--I'm getting better and I like the game more.  You won't like this unless you are willing to play several times.  It's hard even if you play cards regularly.  The more you play the better you will become at evaluating your hands and flexing your strategy mid play.  It's especially important to know when to stop taking tricks (if you can) if you are going for the high points in a hand.  Take 100 or more and you get nothing and give the other two players points instead.  Use the players aids here.  Nick, a regular, says you should play several hands bottom up or top down before even introducing trumps.  I'm not sure about that but it does take a gradual approach to introduce the flavors of the game (trumps, top down no trumps, bottom up no trumps) and special powers.

Trick-taking games are among my favourite games but my gaming group is mostly lukewarm on them up to a degree of despising them. Cosmic Eidex had to tank on its outing as it further complicates things by its rules which are anything but clear if you don't happen to be Swiss and are used to playing Jass and counter-clockwise. Add to this Cosmic Encounter inspired special powers unique for each game and you've lost all your fellow players.
Too bad, as Jass forms a solid base for this trick-taker with a few unique feats such as trumping even when you still could follow suit and not being allowed to throw in lower trumps when a higher trump is already played. The added victory point conditions help that there basically is no weak hand as you just can aim for another condition. I guess I have to seek an additional game group that is more into trick-taking.

Well, let's face it, if you have an ordinary deck of playing cards and a copy of the rules, you have this game.

I really like the scoring system here. The potential to score by going high or low means that one is much less susceptible to bad draws, and the penalty for going too high forces someone with a great hand to try to spread the wealth a bit.

Rating made it up to 8 before I even gotten to play with the special powers. The jury is still out on those. Some of them can really throw the game off kilter, whereas others are of minimal use. I think I prefer the purity of the game without them, but that's not to say I won't keep trying them out.

Easily the best three player game around. Rules seem complex and just plain weird at first, but learning them is easily worth the effort as the game itself is fantastic. With experienced players Cosmic Eidex has incredibly low luck factor - best player wins, not the one who draws most low or high cards, like in many other trick taking games.

What a blast! Trick-taking game which works like a toilet in a train. It doesn't matter what kind of cards you get, because you have always chances to play a good round. This is a good lesson for example 'the Bottle Imp'.

RATING: 6
First the scoring points and the cards priority is completely mixed up. Apparently it's based around a swiss national trick taking game. So anybody else would not be familiar with it.

The main innovation of the game is that you must either be the strongest or the weakest, but not in the middle in order to score points. Which makes it interesting is that you sometimes need to change your strategy in the middle of the round. Still I would have loved to have even more situations when you would need to change your strategy.

Else, there are 32 unique special powers assigned to each player. The problem is that they are totally chaotic power where some are more useful than the others. It has the interest of adding replay value, but I found it a bit unbalancing. I would like to have a better structure in the design of the special abilities.

So I think the game would have been better with better designed components. For example, placing some cards point value directly on the card to make it easier to calculate.

An excellent 3 player trick-taking game.  It's often described as "a three-handed style of cosmic encounter in a trick-taking game format".  Lots of special powers for each round with very quirky rules that make virtually every round "different" and therefore decision-making & goals varies.  It's offbeat and keeps-you-on-your-toes interesting.

RATING: 9
This is a fabulous three player card game where everyone will have a special power that can effect how the game is played.  There are 36 special powers so each game will likely be different.  As well, the last card dealt determines trump/no trump and power and value of the nine cards per suit.  The first player to seven points wins the game.  To earn a point, you must either be the highest and lowest scoring player for each hand, OR force one other player to score over 100 points so the other two earn a point, OR if you take every trick then you earn 2 points, OR if two people end up tied for points (assuming the remaining person isn't over 100) then the third person earns 2 points!  Tricky little game that throws a number of curveballs.  As well, while you generally have to follow suit, you are also allowed to play trump at any time.  If trump is lead, then everyone must play higher if possible!

RATING: 6
A good trick-taking game for three players, with the interesting twist of special powers.  If I had two other players that wanted to play this on a regular basis, I suspect my rating would rise.  Since I don't, the rating might be too high.  This game doesn't reward casual play due to the unfamiliar (to me, anyway) scoring system and ranking of cards in trump suit, let alone all the special powers (which reward knowing all the ins and outs of the game to know how best to use them).

Fun game with interesting powers (some of which can be used in unexpected ways).  A pain to get people started as the rules seem strange but it isn't that hard to play.  I did have a couple hands where it seemed like there was little hope to get the high or low hand, but usually one goal or the other is attainable.  (If two players want to go low then they can even work together.)

Strange twist on trick-taking as players are aiming to either take the least amount of points or the most points (but don't get too greedy!) in a 3-player game.  Trying to fall inbetween the other scores is tricky and you'll often need to change strategies mid-stream.  One draws a special power before the game begins (each card represents a power -- luckily they aren't huge rule-breakers).  Also, interestingly the point values of cards are different depending on what the trump suit is (Sheepshead).  Sounds convuluted but it all ties in fairly well.

Love trick-taking games and this one is quite unique. Now that I've played with the full rules, find the game even more fascinating. Some rules seem to be thrown randomically, but the game is far from chaotic. In fact, is less complicated than it seems, but its much better if you play with the same group... I would love to play it more often.

Holy shit. After reading about the hierarchy for the trump suit I can see I'm going to need cheatsheets and determined partners to learn this one.

Excellent three-player game. It's not even that complicated, if you're familiar with other Ace-Ten games. Without any trick-taking base, of course, it's probably almost uncomprehensible. I like it a lot, anyway.

Based on Plus-minus-jass, which is probably the better game.

Strange game.  Not a trick taking game fan but this one works for me - probably because it does away with so many of the usual trick taking game conventions.  Scoring is a bit arcane and the fact that it only plays 3 keeps this score at a 6, but could go up another point perhaps.

It's a hard game to get your head around. There's a wide disparity in the value of the special powers each player gets, so we play that everyone gets a new power each hand to add variety and interest. It's important to track the points and the cards, so that slows things down. It's a neat central idea but it only ever gets the occasional play.

This is such a terrible game I don't even want to waste time writing about it, but I'm baffled by its high rating here on BGG. People have rated it highly and have ascribed to it some respectable characteristics, such as "brain burner". This is not brain burner. It is a bunch of arbitrary, senseless, and memory intensive rules, which do not make a game a "brain burner" or good, rather simply a stupid one.

The different ranking for trumps vs. non-trumps, vs. no-trump hands plus the idiotic bean counting upside-down and right-side up scoring system form perhaps the worst "game" I've ever known. By the way, I do like trick taking and climbing card games and I'm a decent Bridge and Tichu player and love Sticheln and Die Sieben Siegel. Why waste your time on this when there are so many great games? Actually "Cosmic ... stupidity" should not even be mentioned in the same paragraph as the above games. Clearly I'll never play this again.

RATING: 8
I love it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but experienced tricktakers. The basic set-up is that cards are worth different numbers of points and you want to take either the most points or the least points in a hand, but not get stuck in the middle. But you also go bust if you take too many points, so it's quite the balancing act. As if that wasn't difficult enough, some hands are randomly chosen to be played by slightly different rules, and each player has an individual special power that lasts for the entire game. There's a hell of a lot of game here for just 36 cards.

RATING: 7.5
Most trick taking card games have one path to victory.  In Cosmic Eidex, what you need to do to do well changes from hand to hand.  Sometimes you need more points, sometimes less.  Sometimes you want to be right in the middle.  And sometimes you just want it all!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What separates this from all other trick-taking games? The combination of being able to trump any time you want and the scoring objectives: to either capture the most or the least point-cards in tricks - NOT the middle number!

As a result, card-counting is not as important (well, we kept track with pencil and paper the card points we accumulate). Trick playing is far more dynamic as your strategies will change throughout a round -- the game doesn't feel as dry as your typical standard trick-taking game.

As for the strange scoring and ranking of cards, remember that this is based on Jass, which first appeared in the late 1700s (which, by the way, isn't that old for a classic trick taking game). It seems that the older the trick taking game, the more bizarre the rules tend to be. So if you're used to modern Euro games with streamlined rules, the scoring system in Cosmic Eidex is something you'll have to get used to.

Also, there's a reason that the most powerful cards (like the two highest trumps) are worth so much more than the rest of the deck -- it makes it easier to predict whether you're able to capture a high (or low) value number of points, which makes you more willing to take bigger risks.

The special power that each player has is simply an added bonus.

If you're too cheap to purchase this game yourself, then play with a regular deck of cards -- but then you're missing out on the excellent card art.

Unique abilities for each player add variation to this clever card game. No matter what you're dealt there's usually the chance to make the most of it and score a point. It becomes a fun excercise in either trying to score as few points as possible or trying to score as close to 99 as you can without going over. It all boils down to a fun time that comes to a conclusion after seven or eight hands.

Cosmic Eidex -- 

Played once.

For our first ever session of Cosmic Eidex, we thought we'd play a few rounds without player powers, then play the full version.  

[COLOR=#0000FF][i]( A little background:  There are three modes of play (Trump; No-trump, top-down; and No-trump, bottom-up), and which mode is used for a hand is determined at the beginning of that hand.  The ranks and values of the cards change depending on mode.  Furthermore, in Trump mode, trumps are ranked and valued differently from the other cards.)[/i][/COLOR]

After those practice rounds, we decided that the changes in card values and in card ranks were counter-intuitive enough that adding player powers would be a bit too much, so we decided to play the entire game without player powers.

We enjoyed ourselves, and I expect we'll add player powers next time.

[COLOR=#CC0000]WARNING:  Play is counterclockwise.  Be prepared to screw up turn order for the rest of the day when playing clockwise games![/COLOR]

Played solo. Ehm. I dunno. Maybe it's much better with actual people and the whole 2 persons score and third does not aspect, well probably this is the case. 

The baroque Jass rules are well baroque, they make a bit sense in that the trump jack and 9 are worth a lot of points. The whole random powers thing is well, hm, random? Might keep interest with repeated play, will see. At least it cost 3 euros, so no big loss.

RATING: 6
A quirky trick taking game based on Skat: there are 36 cards numbered 6 to Ace in 4 suits. Cards are distributed and the last card over determines both trumps and the type of game played. Each game is quite different with scoring flipped on its head in each game. The object is to score 7 VPs. Each hand could potentially gain a player anything from 0-2 VPs depending on victory conditions (generally points scored from tricks won).

To add to the confusion are special abilities: each player get a special ability that breaks the rules of the game. Beware, it takes some patience and player aids to get the game smoothly going. The cards are lushly illustrated but are sometimes hard to make out. Worth a look for trick taking fans.

Kooky three player trick taking game.  It feels a bit like you are taking a stab in the dark trying to achieve your goal, but it is good fun.  I'm not a fan of trick taking games in general, but with the variable goals this makes for some decision making that I find lacking in many other of these kinds of games.  This is surprisingly easy to wrap your head around once you get used to everything.

Perhaps the only card game weirder is Twilight. 

I like the variable powers, and the ability for team ups.  This has a great sense of ebb and flow.  I want to play this again soon.

Wow, this game is weird! There are a lot of little rule exceptions and strangeness, but the game is oddly fun. I don't like having to constantly look up point values and track the #pts I'd taken so far - a lot of math - but even in our partial game (to 6 VP) I was starting to become familiar with all the point values. After 2 hands of the basic game, we switched to Advanced. The powers were fun, although I wonder if they're balanced? I would like to try it again, although not at the end of a game night!

One of the weirdest trick-tacking games in my collection. Fortunately, the ranking of the cards and their point value is very similar to the traditional Dutch game Klaverjassen, so at least that part isn't distracting. Haven't played very much yet, so the rating may rise. At the moment, there's just a bit too much chaos in the game. Especially with the cosmic powers, the other players can really mess with you.But still, a very fun and clever card game from the designer who gave us Tichu.

RATING: 8
Wow, now this is an excellent game.  Although it has the special powers tbd before each "tournament," it's still not quite as hard for people to learn as Skat...and even though it lacks the tension of bidding in Skat, I think I might enjoy it even more.  Hopefully it'll continue to stand up in interest. 

It plays only exactly three players, but that's ok, as it fills a specific niche, and the game is eaily remembered...just got to look up the special power cards that are drawn each time.  the rest of the game, with a scoring cheat sheet printed out, is simple enough for experienced trick-takers to understand and play to.  For that reason I find it a little odd that some people have said its hard to wrap your head around, because it's not really, if your playing from a broad base of varied trick-taking games.  It may be more difficult if your group only plays a single type--say only hearts, or only Tichu, etc.  But if your group plays Mit List und Tuch, and Tichu, and Hearts, and Sticheln, etc, the non-standard trick ranking is pretty straight forward.

The trump, or lack thereof, and the direction of card-ranking being determined each hand makes for a thrilling experience!  Trying to meet some goal from a special card, great!  Trying to stick someone who's playing strong with more than 100 points, brilliant!!!

Seriously, this is the best 3-player trick-taking game out there so far.  Get it, learn it, love it!

[Abacus 1998 edition] {Card; variable-player-power, trick-taking} Cosmic Eidex is a unique trick-taking game for 3 players. It's of the better 3p trick-taking games. This is not a general trick-taking game. It's more suitable for experienced players or trick-taking game lovers. Its rule is complicated and unintuitive - special ranks, special scoring, etc. It needs a few hands for players to understand the rules and remember ranks of card. It takes several other hands for players to apprehend the game.

Nothing special about the illustration. A cue card should be provided for the function of each character.

Played 2+ times.  Haven't played with the special powers yet, but the basic game is pretty good.  It's better to go for the low because you get points if you're the low or if someone busts.  If everyone is going for the low, everyone still gets card points and you have to be pretty careful not to end up in the middle.  Getting all the tricks is pretty hard, because you can trump in anytime.  Lots of fun parsing how to play your hand. 2008/11/06

The good: This is a challenging trick-taking card game. I like that it is designed for exactly three players. The super-small box format is nice. The little player powers assigned at the start fo the game are varied, add some nice variety and keep replayability high. The bad: The main drawback here is that the constantly changing point values of cards taken in tricks is, at best, a bit fiddly, and may be downright confusing to casual players. That aspect of the game knocks Cosmic Eidex down a peg in my ratings, but with a trio of hard-core, experienced card players, the game can shine.

A rather unusual game in that it is designed for 3 players--and only 3 players.  That being said, it is probably one of the best 3 player games around.  Why?  Most 3 player games devolve into two players beating the tar out of the third.  But that rarely if ever happens in CE.  Since the object of the game is to be the highest or lowest in tricks taken in a given hand, your strategy and objective will change from hand to hand, as will your opponents. It can be a bit confusing to learn, but if you've played Skat, you'll probably recognize some of the mechanisms in Cosmic Eidex.  If you are looking for a good 3 player game, give CE a look.

RATING: 8
Good trick taking game, where the players always have something to do.  Go for points, avoid points, or dump points on the high point to make him/her pass 100.  Even without the special powers this would be a fun 3 player card game.  Add the special powers, you get chaos, fun, and interesting synergy's.  Still the subtleties of card play still exist, and all hands have an out.  The powers add a nice "take that" which trick games really seem to have that "F You" moment.  Really glad I tried.  Hopefully the inital momentum of this game won't wear off, and it'll shine more with more experience and quicker point counting.  This could go up with experience.... I can't imagine it falling, but we'll see.  The stripped down game has many clever ideas in its scoring, the pairing off a card from your hand in your trick pile.  The special powers just put it over the top.

Each player is dealt random card at the beginning, and then you look up that card in a chart to find what your ability will be for the game.  I guess it's a bit like Cosmic Encounter in this way.

Clearly, just creating so many powers takes some time, so I have to acknowledge the development team on this.  But rather than balance them all perfectly, they decided that quantity was more important.  

If I played this over and over, I could eventually find out which of the abilities are strongest, and develop theories about how to play depending on the combination of the other two player's powers.  But, to be honest, I just don't care enough.  I'd rather spend that time playing a game that I know has good balance.

If you like highly asymmetrical games and this one sounds fun to you, then you'll probably enjoy it.  It's not a terrible game, it's just not my cup of tea.

My favorite 3 player card game.  There are a lot of details to keep in mind, and many difficult decisions to be made.  A wonderful game.

The trouble with getting this to hit the table is that it's very complex. Artwork is fantastic.

This three-handed trick-taking came can be confusing, even with the rules right in front of you (though that may be more due to a bad translation than anything else).  There's an interesting core design there, based off of Skat, and though it takes a while to get the flow of the game, once you get going, it's a bit easier, if only because Cosmic Eidex removes the bidding-with-cards-from-your-hand mechanism.

This isn't a real game, is it?  Sounds like something from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Quirky, 3-player, trick-taking card game with special powers.  Every game is different.  Always takes a little longer to play than I think it should (it's 90-120 minutes for me), but I enjoy it the whole time.

[b]Eidex[/b]: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] An interesting, unusual spin on trick-taking games.  Although predominantly [thing=11330]Jass[/thing], it provides enough of its own spin that it is special.  The base game Eidex can easily be played with a standard deck of cards, but Abacus has provided gorgeous watercolor art that make this small deck worth owning.

After 1 Play: I really like the idea of special powers like this in a card game, and I like the basic framework of this game.  You can either try for the low or the high (but not too high), but since most hands are middling, it can be tough to choose.  However, the card ranks, and point values and some of the rules about trump just confuse me while I'm playing.  I'd rather focus on strategy than on trying to remember what beats what.  I've read that all these rules are based on the traditional card game [gameid=11330], but for me they just seem needlessly arcane.

OK, so it's basically Jass; but it's a good version of Jass.

Does this game suck or what? The horrible rank order and scoring of the cards are simply stupid.

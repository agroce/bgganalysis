An interesting tile-laying game.  I liked the graphics, and there is pretty good player interaction.  My only quibble with the game is that the luck of the draw for the tiles seems like it could be pretty swingy.  It is a fast and simple game though, great for filler.  I imagine it is a very different game with more than 2 players, I'd be interested to see how that goes.

RATING: 4
[b]28.10.2014 - After 1 play[/b]
[b]BACKGROUND[/b]: I have a love/hate relationship with Knizia's games. On the Love side are Ingenious and Keltis, while on the Hate side is The Great Wall.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]: The board is configured as a grid, with the players placing tiles (drawn) or castles (which score points from the tiles) in its cells. After the grid is filled, all the castles are scored. Repeat for 3 rounds.

[b]ART/COMPONENTS[/b]:  The components and art are regular ones, nothing fancy, with the exception of the plastic castles that look OK. The art on the tiles are your regular fantasy illustrations.

[b]DIFFICULTY[/b]: Very easy to teach and to learn, the only "difficulty" might appear when calculating the score.

[b]THOUGHTS[/b]: Although I have no problem with abstracts games, not even with those with pasted-on theme, this game is nothing but a math exercise. The decisions are not essential, as your "choices" are very luck dependent.

In other words, MEH.

Beautiful art and simple game play. Did not appeal to me, felt like just poping down tiles to get the best VP out of it. Will reach a point where the options a so obvious, that it's senseless to play.

Good initial start, anti climax for me. ( please don't explain the part about preparing for the later part of the game play.....etc....etc.....) with that number of tiles..... Not much to prepare is it?

RATING: 5
C'est un peu difficile a définir si c'est un bon jeu ou non. Le mécanisme est correct, sans plus. C'est un jeu de base de placements de tuiles. 

Une partie a deux joueurs est le meilleur mais peut facilement être débalancé si c'est toujours le même joueur qui pige les tuiles négatives.

Une partie a quatre joueurs est n'importe quoi, c'est la chance pure et simple et on peut pas vraiment utiliser de stratégie.

Une partie a 3... c'est moyen.

Nice, fairly quick game with lots of tough choices. Kingdoms is great with 2 players but is a little too chaotic with 4 (but still not bad!). With 2 (and 3 also) you get a nice battle with some tough choices which are mostly along the line of 'Do I screw my opponent, help myself or try to block my opponent from screwing me!'. Small enough that you can still figure out the math quickly but big enough to allow for plenty of variety and not make players feel constricted in the number of choices on a given turn. This is quite a confrontational game but is really very good. I use this game to reinforce basic math skills with my older daughter. It works very well as an educational game although it is a bit more 'in your face' than most games of that type.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I probably like this game more than I should. Fun game of logic and "card counting". Tough but quick decisions, planning, hoping no one screws you over, keeping the right tile up your sleeve to turn the tide, destroying your opponent's newly placed kingdom with a "monster" tile, sneaking your kingdom into the sweet spot before your opponent can. I enjoy this one, it's quick yet satisfying. I play it here on the 'Geek quite a bit, as well as at home with my group.

I enjoy Kingdoms. If you are reading this, that means you're looking for some feedback on Kingdoms, and while I may not be particularly good at carefully constructing my opinions into reviews, I can give you my thoughts on the game. Kingdoms is a strategy game with very streamlined rules and very deep game play. It can lead to some very tense game play as the right move can crush your opponent and secure your victory in the same swift move.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly pleasant and quick tile placement game that has just enough in it to make it an interesting filler that I would not mind playing quite often.  On the other hand, I might have changed the tile distribution a bit to have slightly more negative tiles such that there was a little bit more fear when placing a castle down.  As it is, most everything scores most of the time it seems.

This is an enjoyable game but one that plays with a significant amount of luck. Playing over three epochs will go some way to controlling that though but probably not enough for my preferences. Scoring is done 3 times during a game and can be a little fiddly but I’m sure it would become second nature with experience.

RATING: 6
A typical Knizia title in that it is both simple and highly mathematical.  Game play consists of laying a tile or playing a scoring disk.  Scoring is based on the sum of rows and columns multipled by the players scoring disk.  With 4 players, it can be hard to plan for your next turn.  A turn is most dictated by the preceeding player's action.  This can make it hard for inexperienced players to break out of setting up the next player for a high score play.  Luck of the draw can influence game.  [GTI Code: AGCL]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A tile placement game with some castle figurines you use to score along vertical and horizontal tracks, while trying to fudge the other player's chances. There are also some neat tiles with powers that meddle with the scoring. It does feel a little repetitive but you could think of this as advanced, tactical Tic Tac Toe. Decent early Reiner Knizia design, and the Fantasy Flight repackage is gorgeous.

Easy enough for kids to play but a challange to win for all. 

Like many Knizia games, the scoring is a little long while you need to add up each row and column for each player at the end of each round (3). Have a pen and paper handy! 

Components are lacking. I would purchase the Beowulf: The Movie version of this instead. A little boring. Traded.

I used to have the "Kingdoms" edition from Fantasy Flight to see what the fuss was about.  It's actually quite a good game, and I don't mind that the theme is rather pasted on. This was a much better early FFG silver line Knizia outing than Maginor was for me.

Recently I splurged and bought the full out and out Auf Heller und Pfennig version, which has art I like better, a larger board, and nice wooden stalls (instead of the little castle tokens).

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Fun, but nothing special.  This game is much nastier that I thought it would be going in.  There is also a little too much luck for this type of game, with all your decisions really being based on how well you know the tiles, and how well you can count them.  The production on the FFG version is very nice.  Normal FFG cardboard, with very nice art on the tiles, board, and cover.  It also has 3d mini castles which are really cool.  I would like to try this one with 4 players, but I don't think this one will last very long in the collection.

[Traded Tanga mystery game Roundabout and an extra copy of Oasis for this and Atlanteon.]
This is a good filler. I played it with 2, 3, and 4. It plays great with all. It's hard to decide if you should take a chance and place your castle in a spot where a dragon or negative tile could still affect it or hope that the row/column fills in a bit but still has room for a castle your next turn.

My wife likes it a lot, and I think it's pretty good if a bit overly straightforward.

We taught it to our six-year-old son and he LOVES it.  The three of us play it every day, and he's playing it all the time on our iOS devices.  He's really good at it, too!

So I've played this dozens of times in the last few weeks, and you know what?  I still find the game engaging and am not tired of it.  That's a 10 for us.

Very light filler. Not bad, not great- can be fun, however the games seem to take too long for what is actually there.

Edit: Haven't played for years but I don't have much of a desire to play again, given my review above. Knocking down to a 5 although I had played this game a decent amount in the past.

Auf Heller und Pfennig is almost verging on an exercise in mathematics, as you might expect from an early Knizia, but there's a decent game here,   

Now redone as 'Beowulf the Movie', which I possibly marginally prefer - but this is slightly easier to pick up and play as it has only a couple of special tiles and uses the same board for all three rounds.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
For me, one of Herr Knizia's least successful games. Lacks the fine polish of most of his later big-box stuff, with too  much intellectual work for too little payoff. The Beowulf: The Movie Boardgame is a dramatic improvement; ironically, Knizia had little to do with that remake.

Kingdoms is a very solid little math game with an amusing theme and good "Reiner" mechanics.  A fun way for the kids to practice their (very basic) math skills.  We make them take turns to see who can add up the score fastest.  My wife lost our first copy; we had to get another.

Place positive resource tiles or negative danger tiles on the board. Try to get as much resource from the placement of your castles as they gather from the row and column in which they are placed. Some special tiles add extra spice and some tactics to this neat little game. 1 Play.

RATING: N/A
Rules read.  Quick tile laying game.  Not much to it, should be a good filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The two key elements seem to me to be timing and not setting up the player to your left. Timing in that you have to know when the best moments to place your castles are, when they are likely to score points without being messed with by your opponents. There is also a timing element with your secret tile, when to best play it. You also have to be careful when placing tiles so as not to set up the opponent to your left. Every mistake you make in placement, they will be the one to capitalise on it.

Note, there is some element of bash the leader in that you can target players once they have a castle in play. However, I found it to be rather weak as you rarely had many options of how to harm others because there are usually only so many options of placements that harm others without harming yourself. Due to the nature of the game, our interests during play are often intertwined.

What keeps the game from getting a higher rating and being a keeper is that situations can arise where you get hammered that arise out of luck. This can be very frustrating for the player on the receiving end. And being frustrated isn't why I play games.

RATING: 6.5
This Knizia game is typical Knizian! It has so simple rules and yet quite deep gameplay. Draw a tile and place it or place one of your castles. That’s it until the game ends after 3 rounds! You score (or lose!) a lot of points depending on where you put your castles and tiles, so you need to really think about what to do. It’s great with 4 players as you sort of get “allies” as you want to build good rows in the same rows, but that just means that the other players will put terrible tiles which might give you huge amount of negative points if you don’t watch out! 

Sure, you still draw the tiles randomly, and they certainly aren’t equally balanced and good, but it really doesn’t feel like you get screwed by bad luck (which is also helped by the fact that the game is relatively short and the fact that you play 3 rounds so the luck gets mitigated). The dragon and the goldmine tiles are very powerful if you get them at the right time, but a +4 or even a mountain can also be very helpful. 
I really like that once you’ve used your castles, they are gone for good in the next round (except for the level 1s), so you need to play balanced but also pull the trigger once with your level 4 castle tile which can be worth huge amount of points – but your opponents know that, so they will do everything they can to stop you!

It’s a very nice, short game which works great with 3 and 4 players. I haven’t tried 2 yet, but I would imagine it would lose a lot in terms of tension, the tightness of the board and decision-making.

This is an enjoyable, quick filler by Knizia.  A fun little game with the potential for a lot of "screwage" of your opponent.  I would imagine this plays better with 4 than with 2, as the board will get crowded really fast between turns.

This is a tile-placement game that has lovely pieces and a nice level of complexity.  Often it's difficult to figure out where tiles should be placed because a lucrative row or column is bound to get hit by negative tiles by opponents.  My favorite aspect of the game is how both rows and columns are scored, making placement quite a bit more challenging.

About 20 plays (2, 3 & 4 players).... This one clicked immediately. I'm impressed.  I really like it. A lot. And the feeling has increased. I want to compare & contrast it with Samurai. Seems to have similar strong scalability, number/area majority focus, tile choices, timing angst, push-your-luck opportunities, good-pain Think factor, and luck. I think the scoring is quicker & easier with Instant Completed Columns Scoring).  And it's not as pretty as Samurai, doesn't have the 3-D tokens, but I like how it looks. But it does give a similar kind of game feeling, and has its own numberific merits. In some ways I like it better than Samurai, although it's not as preternaturally perfect as Sam is. It lacks pain of sublimity, and gives your dirty coal-shovelfuls of delicious numeric punishment flung at your face by your opponents. Samurai = silent play, forgetting to breathe; kingdoms = groans and exclamations. I like its tricky weight (lightish bouquet yet with spicy mediumish tannins), good mix of luck and calculation, choices but limited choices so the game moves along nicely.  I dig that. No A/P. I'm not a numbers guy but I find the numbers tasty here. (It turns out the positive numbers do taste better than the negatives.) I like how from a blank grid, it creates a value terrain that impels strong feeling. I also like the choices presented with your different castles and how they can impact the three epochs. I imagine that the luck might bother some gamers, and yes there is some unavoidable luck, but it's mitigated maybe 50% by your choices... imperfect luck management is part of the strategy. It has substance, it's quick but not super-quick, can fill the role of a filler while bringing nearly medium-weight feel and that good Knizia Pain. Decisions revolve around the typical Knizia "need to to multiple contrary and intertwined things": Risk management, pushing luck for points, minimizing opponent points. You can sometimes manipulate forced moves by your opponent. You can create alliances, partial alliances, and sometimes backstab. Themewise, you can sometimes see that the filled board is trying to tell a story. I feel sorry for some castles in benighted lands when playing with four player. At this time I think paying out money per completion of columns and rows seems to work easier than calculating points after each Epoch. I'd like to try some of the variants. Bought my own copy. Easy to teach, quick to set-up, gripping to play, it's a great game, a Keeper, a strong performer, something I always want to have handy on game night. GF says, "It's good but it makes my stomach hurt!" Update: I made a wooden version of the game with larger tiles.

Clever, mathy game.  Very abstract, meaningless theme.  Actually from the pictures, I think I like the cutesy marketplce theme better.  But that's not here nor there ... my only gripe with the game is like Carc, you are handcuffed by the tile you pull.  Unlike Carc there are much fewer spaces to place your tile on so each bad tile screws you even harder.  And ... the game can swing dramatically based on whether you got a useful reserve tile or not.  Still playable and fun, just not likely to be my first choice.  Will probably get more plays on BGG than in person.

RATING: 6
Tile laying game with a thin theme.  Tiles or player's castles are laid in a grid.  When the grid is complete, scores are calculated for the row and column each player's castle is in.  The tiles can increase or decrease the score of a castle.  Each player's set of castles is the same.  Tiles are drawn from a common pool.

Spectacular light-mid, abstract strategy game by the amazing Reiner Knizia. Plenty of strategy and enough chance to keep it interesting. Get the right tile at the right time and you can change the game significantly. You want to help yourself and block your opponents from big points. Definitely plenty of chances to harm other players with your decisions, especially when the big castles are in play. 

Outstanding replay-ability, too. You can play the standard rules dozens of times and never get tired of the game.

Plenty of opportunities to implement rules variants if you want to spice it up. You can dial down the chance element and amp up the strategy component with some of these variants. BGG contains some variants in their Forum for this game.

I recommend playing with 4 players for the best experience.

I'm still working at explaining how it is important to get your castles on the board.  They are too focused on giving me negative points.

Components: Nice artwork; functional tiles. I appreciate all the cardboard coins. I'd rather have the new edition with castles, instead of castle tiles.

Experience: A sort of press-your-luck game. It's helpful to have a mutual interest with another player to help keep a row or column safe. Having a tile in reserve adds to the strategy, so that we're not completely at the whim of the draw, but I like the drawing too, because it makes each move more of a gamble, whereby I don't know if my opponent will draw the correct tile to take advantage of my vulnerability.

There is far too much work calculating the scores at the end.  The gameplay itself looks promising, but too much depends on drawing lucky tiles in the critical moments.

This is not one of my favorite Knizia abstracts.  It has a little more theme than his normal abstracts, but it comes with additional complications that make it less easy to teach to casual gamers.  But the main reason I am not very fond of Kingdoms is that it does not have as much depth as other abstracts.

RATING: 7
Ok game. I have only played it with three playes but it feels a bit unbalanced. The one who draws the dragon piece is often the winner (or at least not the loser that round). Besides if you get a good first round, you can just destroy for everyone else the next two rounds and probably win that way.Owned once but sold it. Bought a new copy for $7.I actually like it more after some additional play. Best with 3 players.

Update: Sold it again.

RATING: 6
Nice quick tile laying game.  Loses a point for the ridiculous "tile in hand" rule.  I draw the Dragon, you draw a  1.  Who do you think will win by 50 this round?  Coolest rule is that there aren't enough tiles to fill up the board with two players.  So the troll-infested haunted death swamp in the bottom row is going to see some one-strength castles if you let it fester too long.

RATING: 6
This is either a 6 or 5.  Simple abstract game.  A good amount of luck is needed in the form of tile draws or hoping the other players don't hose you.  Not bad filler though..easy to teach and quick to play.

RATING: 6
Very simple but rather vicious game of market manipulation on a 6 x 5 grid, representing a village market square. On your turn you may play a tile, which are essentially positive or negative numbers; or place a market stall which are multipliers along the row and column your stall resides in. When the grid is full, total each row and column for the players earnings (or losses). Play three rounds, highest cash. Very simple and quick.

Quick and clever little math puzzle, like many a Knizia game. With two players, it's quite brutal and it can be a bit like playing tic-tac-toe in that your opponent is forced to react to your moves. With 3  players, there is more chaos since the moves of multiple players become harder to predict. Played it with 3 and enjoyed it very much, moreso than with 2.

Played 2 times. My impression of this game is colored by the fact that I went into my playing with extremely low expectations. Since the game isn't abyssmal, it is riding a bit of a high with me. The Fantasy Flight version isn't wonderful to look at, but the setting is fairly well chosen, and the game has a nice feel to it. Decent board game filler. Still, quite mathy, so not for everyone.

This is another Reiner Knizia family game with simple rules and enough strategy to keep me interested.  I am also drawn to tile games, of which this is one.

I have resisted playing this game for several years because I did not, do not, like the graphics.  Glad I finally brought it out because it is a fairly short and reasonably fast game that some of my family will play.

Interesting mathematical filler (a typical Knizia), but not really something to finish a game night with, as clear heads are required to play well.

Only player 2 player so far and its quite neat, could get a little hectic with 4 players I suspect. Now played with 3 and 4 players, 3 seems best as you can still plan your moves to take advantage of the tiles you placed previously to some extent, where as 4 by the time it gets back round to your turn the board is completely different.

Dry and themeless, but when has that ever mattered? Plays fast (although scoring isn't so fast) and tactical. The board's size means everything is interconnected, so tile draws don't feel as 'swingy' as they might and opportunity to screw others over is mostly foreseeable and not totally unbalanced. Castles not replenishing means it feels like one coherent game instead of three. I enjoy this.

I like it best with 2P, but 3P is fun, too.  Tile draw adds a significant amount of chance, but that is mitigated over the three rounds.  Simple observation of what tiles are already played makes it a lot easier to play the odds and know when to risk a big castle.

The Fantasy Flight artwork is decent but far too busy for such an abstract game.  Large icons would work better.  I was going to make a homemade copy with simply numbers on wooden pieces, but the FFG $5 sale won me over.

Fantasy Flight's "Silver Line" games can be pretty drab looking.  The artwork is a little better here in comparison to Cave Troll or King's Gate.  Despite the artwork and modest production, Kingdoms is an excellent game.  I have only played it two player, and it can be quite addictive.  Yes, the theme is tacked on but I don't care.

One of Reiner Knizia's most underrated designs, more recently rethemed and published as 'Kingdoms.' If you're not big on math and numbers, stay away from this one.  The game situations involve difficult tradeoffs and odds calculations, and the overall experience is much more interesting than the you might expect from reading the rules.  It's great with two or three, but I avoid playing with four players - too little control over the board.

A very simple and elegant game of placing your pieces in rows on a grid in order to get the most bonuses possible vs. the other players. The theme is pasted on. This game later re-emerged as Beowulf: The Movie game. I own but haven't tried the new version of it yet.

This is not the most amazing game to ever emerge, but it is solid and if you try it, I bet you will like it.

Another simple design from Knizia that offers limited choices but compelling gameplay. It's a nicely distilled tile-laying game that works really well.

I have the FFG 3rd edition, and I'm pretty frustrated by the design choices. Although the artwork is very nice, it is too large and bright, making the numbers hard to read at a glance. I understand why game companies try to "enhance the theme" with artwork, but so often it makes things worse by hindering the usability. I'd love to make a purely utilitarian version with just numbers on the tiles.

Kingdoms is a Knizia tile-laying game for two (to four actually), where players vie for control of columns and rows, which score different based on the contents added by the players.

Play consists of alternately laying tiles, either castles, landscapes, or hazards, trying to control the kingdoms with the highest value once the square grid is filled.

It plays quickly, but there is a lot of thought going on because of the multiple directions in play, and the rapid changes possible to areas.

I find that while it is a tile-laying game from Knizia (paya kun!), it is a bit busy for what it is, and plays rather confrontationally.

It's not my favorite by far, but any tile-laying game from Knizia promises something interesting, and I expect this one will stay a part of my collection, if only as a a quick change of pace from it's more favored siblings.

Quite a lot of luck, but enough long term planning and short term tactics to keep it interesting. Pretty quick too. Bash the leader issues a little but the luck elements and possibilities of big swings minimize this to a degree. 

On more plays downed this from 8 to 6. Perhaps a little bit too much luck. Plus because you have to hose people leading early can be disasterous. Better with 3 than 4 due to greater control.

2-4 players, 45 minutes.  Three players is even better than two.  Who knew?

I think this game is great for teaching some useful tactics that apply to most games: it's OK to hurt myself if it hurts you more, it's a bad idea to help myself if it helps you more.

Then move on to three player games where there's lots more good stuff to practice & learn about alliances, investments, etc. all in this simple game.

One of a series of very similar 'pick & place' games from this designer, (see Quandary or Wapi for similar fare) in which you obtain a tile by some random mechanism and play it where you feel it will be most advantageous. Little opportunity for skillful play.

RATING: 6
Easy to introduce to non gamers as it's very light.  Perfect as a filler while waiting for your Diplomacy crowd to arive.  Luck plays a major factor but intelligent play can minimixe it's effect to some extent.  Sessions can get quite lively especially when a player has the dragon in hand (Kingdoms) and is considering it's placement.. :)

RATING: 7
A nice little filler, although there isn't too much to it. Whether you are given a useful secret tile, as well as what you and your opponents (particularly the one to your left) draws, can have a significant impact, meaning much is left to luck.

One of my favorite games. Playing it with the right person your mind will switch on real good. Básicamente un juego abstracto al que le han puesto por encima un tema que no añade nada al juego. Pero te hace pensar mucho. Es una ecuación; debes pensar en que parte del grid vas a poner tus fichas para maximizar tus ganancias y disminuir las de los oponentes. Se juega hasta 4 pero es buenísimo para 2.

I like to teach this one to people as we wait for more people to show up to game days, but everybody will inevitably show up right as we're finishing up the first epoch.  Both of the plays logged are actually just one epoch long each because we stopped to play something with everybody.  I'd like to actually make it through the end of the game again, though ;)

First played May 12th, 2007.  This is a tiled based game going after gold.  It's easy to learn and a quick play, which are a plus for me.  There is a good balance of strategy and luck, however luck may take the larger portion.  I'd recommend giving this a game play if you get the chance, however it probably won't hit your table as a regular play.

Kingdoms is a tactical excercise in two dimensional array maximization...with a fantasy setting!  Yeah, the theme might be a little, let's say, "ambiguous," but the game itself is highlighted by elegance, intense player interaction, and above all brevity.  The dragon is such an evil plan-wrecking whore, though.  Man, I hate that guy...

Played it for the first time with my 7yro.  It was a great exercise in math and in watching him slowly figure out the risk/reward structure.  Totally worth it.  Revised my rating way up.

Orig Comment:
Not impressed the first time through.  It plays okay, but I think the theme just gets in the way.  I don't mind pasted themes, but when the theme doesn't even come close to explaining anything, you've gone too far.

Also, I like mathy games, but this one just seemed a little too dry.  I can appreciate the risk taking and the gambling, but it just seems to be on too simple of a level.  I'll give it a few more tries, but I'd rather be playin' Through the Desert.

Fantastic Maths-based game. Elegant and simple and supremely well balanced. A great gateway game and one that everyone loves to play. It's also pretty quick to play so makes a great appetiser or filler. 

Only complaint? It deserves a better version than the Fantasy Flight Silver version; it's such a great game I'd love to own an uber-high production version; it really deserves it.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2013)

I was pleasantly surprised by this game. After (literally) years of hearing how bad was Beowulf: The Movie Board game, I wasn’t expecting anything from Kingdoms. Also it is from Knizia, a designer who is very hit and miss with me.

This is a tactical area control game, in which you have to do the most with the tiles you draw. I think this is a very good 2 player game. With more players the luck factor increase noticeable and the fun factor (for me) begins to decrease. It plays very quickly, the downtime is negligible. Easy to teach too. The bits are very well done. The game art is adequate, but not great. (Obviously from Knizia)  pasted on theme.

Perhaps I will buy it, although I think I will buy (for the third time) the Beowulf game. Not sure if there are other differences besides the theme.

Eventually traded away. (I don't usually trade stuff.)

We stopped playing one day. Then never started again.
---------------------------------
We've opened this one quite a few times now (for 2P) in a relatively short time and (as a big surprise to us both) my wife enjoys it more than I do. Took it on planes et al. The theme is completely pasted on and irrelevant, and I don't actually like the artwork. The game itself is one of creating and leveraging mathematical potentials in a grid without letting your opponent get them. It's quick and clear in its play, but can demand quite a lot of concentration. I haven't played other than 2P but I suspect playing with 4 would be about not getting burned while burning the other players, rather than building your own position... there'd be no way to link one of your plays with the next. (It's hard enough with 2.)

A game of placing tiles and scoring multipliers on a grid and then scoring rows and columns. While the tiles refresh each of the 3 rounds, your multipliers do not, so you need to effectively distribute them across all three rounds of play.

Maybe the most theme in one of Dr. Knizia's games. The tiles and plastic castles help a lot. Wife and I had a good time playing. Easy enough to learn and it's fun to see how the map plays out. I do worry about it lacking variety after several plays. Maybe it won't matter.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting blend of perfect information, push-your-luck and tactics. Perfect information because the tile mix is known fairly limited. Push-your-luck because as each round develops you can discern the likelihood of drawing a known unplayed tile, and making your play based on that knowledge. (But I'm a probability geek; I realize that maximum likelihoods don't come as easily to everyone.) So you grab all of this information and optimize you best move each time. I love it. I understand concerns about anlysis paralysis, so be careful with opponents that are prone to such things. Personally I don't think the game is deep enough to cause paralysis in those who are actually good at numerical and spatial analysis.

While playing, I don't mind it at all.  I think it's an interesting idea, and really it's just an abstract with a (IMO) boring theme.  I'd much rather play it if it was about, say, the amount of bacteria growing on the fork you're eating with, or some other wacky theme.  I can see how a player could get really good at this and how there's a lot of room for thoughtful play and analysis.  I'm just not sure I'm willing to invest the time.

This has become one of my favorite filler or entry level games for me.  It plays quickly, games are usually close, rules are easy to explain, and strategy can feel tense.  This game scales extremely well between 2-4 players and I really don't have a preference for any size in particular.  I've played the older version and own the newer version.  The rules are the exact same (minus the addition of the wizard) and the plastic castles in the newer version are slightly nicer than the cardboard markers but certainly didn't change the enjoyment I have with the game.

RATING: 6
With two this feels much like a push-your-luck game, and the clout of your hidden tile can make a big difference as well. Three may be the best player count. The fantasy theme doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Shallow learning curve for initial play.  Barely enough strategy to keep it interesting.  The theme is definitely tacked on. A touch dry for playing regularly, but there's enough of a game to keep it around.  I find that the strategy required is increasing with subsequent plays.  I'll probably forget about using the coins and just go with a pen and paper.

Very good Knizia game. I would definitely play it again. The scoring at the end cane be tricky to accomplish in a quick/clean way.

I'm a math guy and, while it's true that all board games are ultimately math games, Kingdoms is a MATH GAME. This is a transparent theme tacked onto what is otherwise essentially a game about optimizing linear equations. Knizia's penchant for multiple-round games (where one essentially plays 3 or 4 of the same game with minor variations, then adds them all up for the final score) makes this feel as much like playing a 501 darts game as anything else. Make sure you play with people who are good with math - if you don't calculating your score will take nearly as long as it would take to play the game and someone will likely make a big mistake and "discover" they are the accidental winner ... or loser. I really can't recommend this one for anyone that doesn't want to brush up on their times tables.

I had some fun with the early Kingdoms edition, but I eventually traded it off.  In 2014 I decided to trade for the original German edition, Auf Heller und Pfennig.  We've played it once, and I had more fun than expected.  The graphic design of the Hans im Gluck edition is a boon, and elevates the game for me.

RATING: 7
I use to own the Beowulf Movie version of this game and in several ways that version is a superior version.  It just had a theme that never interested me and is highly dated now.  Not that the kingdoms theme is all that great and it is an abstract after all but the latest FFG production, with the miniature castles, I believe helps the theme come across just a tad bit more and I appreciate this version with the wizard, dragon and so forth.  Ultimately I do like it less than the other Knizia tile laying games but it does play much much quicker.  So in treating it as a slightly mathy, sometimes random filler It does make the cut.  The randomness isn't really as big a factor as it can sometimes seem.  There are 3 rounds total to play and many plays are going to affect you nearly as much as someone else either way.  It's a bit of an optimization game with timing being everything.

DIY set. 

Fairly interesting. Alot of math and a good balance of luck (what tile you pick) and strategy (do you help yourself or hurt your opponent?) I'd like to see more tiles, since just about every tile is used each round. This also makes the game much meaner and more competitive...there's very little being nice in this game, despite its easy mechanics and premise.

Bought from FFG holiday sale '06.
Sold to Carlyn fall '09.

Not really anything wrong with this game, very strategical.  Maybe the fact that players can keep count if they're math wizards or screw the leader, but always different and fun every round.  Now my all-time favorite filler.

I rate it this low, because I guess it doesn't qualify as I always want to play.

Quality rating: 8
Willingness to play rating: 6
Fun rating: 7

Only reason it doesn't get a 10 is it lacks some depth, but mechanics are simple and effective. I love this game, but once again it lacks some real depth, hence the 6 willingness.

I really like Kingdoms as a light quick push-your-luck tile laying game.  It came to my attention by someone else that this could be played with the tiles face-down after placement is revealed.  Requires a good memory but does seem like an interesting idea...  I think I might prefer rules as is (face up tiles) and I almost always prefer Open Holdings over Closed Holding.  But, Blind or Face-Up, I really enjoy the choices involved for this type of filler.

Simple tile laying game where the tiles have numbers ranging from +6 to -6.  On your turn you can place a tile, place a secret tile only you have, or place a castle of strength 1-4.  When all spaces are covered, you score for the round by summing the numbers in every row and column and multiplying by the number of castle towers in that row or column for each color.  

The game is very easy to teach and learn.  It is puzzle-like in its play.

It's fun, but the fantasy veneer (Kingdoms) is irrelevant to the abstract spreadsheet arithmetic. The math is no big deal, but keeping score with coins is a hassle of making change.

I also enjoyed a variant described by [i]sos1[/i]: always draw a tile on your turn, even when you play a castle. (You may build a private stock of tiles this way.) It's best if the draw comes after the play.

[b]I kind of liked it, though (at least in a 4-player game) you can't plan ahead much because so much happens until it's your turn again. Pretty dependent on the luck of drawing tiles too. 
If asked, I would play again, especially with a variant that allows for a bit more planning ahead, e. g. by giving everyone three tiles or allowing players to exchange a tile they drew for the one they got at the start of the game.
What I liked least is scoring at the end of each round: lots of multiplication, addition and trying not to overlook any tiles, in particular special ones. The administration-to-fun ratio is a bit skewed, imho.[/b]

Fun game of inflicting harm to others and helping yourself in the process. I think the 'take that' element makes this fun.  Scoring at the end of a round is a bit tedious.

RATING: 8
You make a single decision in every turn and it is often hard to decide what you want to do - which is a good thing in my book. Pretty simple overall and since you don't know what card will be put down on the table, it is not an entirely strategic game. I'm okay with that and everyone I've played this game with so far has loved it. Everyone! Everyone from my friends to my uncle and my cousin. Played it a ton of times too and it has yet to be boring.
Why only an 8? I'm relatively new to boardgames and expect to find something better. Can't just go scoring my current favourties a 10, 'cause then where do I go from there? The other reason I don't score it higher is that I don't like the generic fantasy artwork in this version of the game so much.

Crypto-mathematical tile placement game where horizontal and vertical positive or negative values tally up. Clever, easy but rich mechanics; high degree of direct interaction with a mild take-that! flavour; mid degree of both tactical (tile placement) and strategical (when to spend a tile of a type) considerations; and a decent though somewhat plastered-on theme. Fast play times of about an hour with four players.

A wonderfully simple, tight and fast, "hidden gem" filler game.  Great fun for a group that can take a good ribbing from each other.  This is not a "friendly" game for the easily offended.  Delicious opportunities to "mess with" the other players, and still have fun.  Easy to learn and get started.  A bit of simple math to calculate the point totals, but nothing too severe.

Better with less players. Especially good with 2. Plays fun, the special tile effects really spice up the game play. However I find that the tile values' distribution is too high (I would haver preferred 1-4), and I don't like that scoring the game takes time and removes from the excitement of playing.

RATING: 7
Not an amazing game, but very nice for what it is.  You have 3 options to fill a board - lay a public tile, lay your secret tile, or play one of your castles.  

There is a good amount of take that action and it's well done.  It plays well 2, 3, or 4p.  Best with 4.  Game plays fast - there is strategy and decision making, but it isn't very deep, which is ok if that's the mood you're in.  We play it when tired or just not in the mood for something super thinky or long, yet don't wan to play a 15 minute card game either.

This game's removal from the collection was a rare instance of obsolescence, rather than of unenjoyment.  I like my few plays of this game, though it was hardly ever asked for by myself or my fellow gamers.  It's an interesting tactical affair, where you can't get too fond of what you've built, because it most likely will come crumbling down around you.  When I was finally able to get my hands on [b][GameID=29308][/b], I felt that the different boards and additional tiles and powers allowed for more replay value.  Ironically, that game still sits in shrink in one of my gaming bookcases...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played once as a two player game.  A typical Knizia game with lots of agonizing strategy built into a very simple idea for a game.  Players draw tiles randomly and place them on the map or can put their own score markers onto the board.  Players must choose where to place tiles so as to best benefit themselves without giving their opponent huge opportunities for points.  I liked it, but want to replay it to see if the random tile draw overwhelms strategy.  But at the least it seems like a great game to test how good you are at dealing with bad draws.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad effort from Knizia. Players place tiles onto a 5 by 6 board. Tiles drawn from the pile range from -6 to +6, plus there are other special tiles. Players may also place one of their own player token which denotes a multiplication factor ranging from 1 to 4. Points are scored by multiplying the player token value with sum of tiles along the row and column (negative points are possible!). Play three rounds, but only the multiplication by  1 player tokens can be recycled from round to round. There is luck in which tiles you draw, but rules are simple, scoring is easy and does not take long too play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very pleasant 2-player game. It is also fun with 3-4 players 
unless players analize the board too much. Still best with 2, though. It is like a 2-dimentional version of Goldrausch. Since there are 30 squares, the same player starts each round with 3. Isn't this a problem?

Ottima scoperta, gioco immediato ma profondo, strategico ma anche veloce. Una scacchiera in mezzo al tavolo conferma l'astrattezza (è un gioco di Reiner Knizia) ma l'ambientazione appiccicata sopra è carina, così come i materiali (castelli di plastica) della seconda edizione. Il conteggio dei punti alla fine di ogni round è un po' 'palloso' ma il gioco viene apparecchiato sempre volentieri.

Decent little area-control game, with no real theme in true Knizia style. But, bigods, the adding up is hard work! Like Lost Cities, there's not quite enough reward for the amount of counting that needs to be done.

Revised opinion with 2P is that this is much more interesting and clever, even if there is some luck swinginess (and, frankly, the no-luck variant just looks like hard work). Downgrade to a 5.5 with more than two.

[i]Another Knizia scratched off the list. Mat picked this one up and taught me. Luckily this game is played over three rounds because the first round fell flat for me.
During the next 2 rounds things began to click and I started to see the different timing/strategy of when to lay castles vs. picking up tiles. This is a very abstract game (shocking I know), but I enjoyed it.[/i]

Characteristic Knizia game: Bring your math skills to the table, and don't expect a lot of theme.

RATING: 6
Simple and deep in the way only Knizia can do it.  Kingdoms is both strategically and tactically interesting.  Scales well for two to four. However it is not among Knizia's very best designs.  Constant of calculation is required for play, making it feel very dry. And unfortunately Fantasy Flight has given us crappy cardboard pieces and cheesy design, making it feel low quality. 

This would rate at least a full point higher if the design and production were done to a German standard. As is, it does have some value for a 2 to 4 player travelable eurogame.

RATING: 7
Kingdoms is a tile-laying game where players place either their castle tiles, which score a given row and column of the grid board for them, or a (usually) random tile from the stack, which affects how castles in its row and column score, either positively or negatively.  The game is played over the course of three rounds, after each of which players get their level-1 castles back (that is, castles that multiply their scoring by 1), but larger castles cannot be re-used in later rounds.  Before each round, players draw a random tile that they keep hidden and can play at any point in the round, which is a nice tactical option.  This is a very tactical game, where players must seize upon opportunities as they come up.  However, it's also pretty easy to knock a player down by placing negative tiles (of which there are plenty) next to his castles.  Players are at the whim of what they draw from the tile stack, but I thought that was okay here.  This is a decent tactical filler.

A prime example of less-is-more. Better than Beowulf because of the lack of pointless rules oddities and tile-removing abilities. Of course the title and theme are blander than white bread, but like other Knizias, this one isn't about the theme, it's about the math.

 The play is a solid Knizia game with tough decisions all the way through. It plays well with two or four players.
Travels well but the theme is weak and abstract. This may be the case with many Knizia games but the components are so simple that it takes away from the theme. Unlike Samurai, which I find to be much like Kingdoms in game play but the components lift you from the abstract feel and bring a thicker meaning and culture to the game.

Surprisingly light and challenging math abstract that plays quickly (if you can add/subtract fast). It's another great filler game from Dr. Knizia that has his penchant for elegant rules and occasionally difficult tactical decisions.

 Played this one night at Madness and just cemented my theory that I hate tile laying games.  This game features a grid where each player places a tile down to get points based on the type of tile they put down.  A dragon cancels everything in it's path.  I lost miserably but I think it's mainly because I was so disinterested in the game.

Tile laying game with actually a bit of thinking and reacting. Very simple and plays up to 4 players. Only played 2p so far and it was a very clever game. You are trying to score lots of points and screw over your opponents at the same time. Definitely, worth the value ($10) that you can find it at. Lots of game for this small box. I look forward to my next play! Awesome mini castles.

I traded away my copy of Kingdoms, and got Beowulf, because it seemed the same but deeper and more varied. I think I played it once, and while I enjoyed it, I learnt of the original theme for this game, which was about having bad neighbors rather than generic fantasy, so I sold Beowulf and got the original version of this game. Since then it sits unplayed. My group hasn't really taken to this game the way I have.

The thing is, this is a very simple, quick playing and punishing game. On your turn you can place a tile, which will either add points or remove points from the row and column it's placed into, or you can place one of your city tiles into a spot. At the end of the round, each city will be worth points equal to it's row and column times it's multiplier. If you place your cities too early, other players will punish you by stacking the negative points in your area. If you play your cities too late, all the high value spots will have been taken and you won't get many if any points. This is the sort of game where you might end a round with less points than you started with. If you can't laugh that off in a one hour game, then avoid this game. If this sounds interesting to you definately check it out.

Great filler game.  Plays quick, but gives some real strategic options.  There is luck involved due to random tile draw, but there is nice mix of risk vs reward with placing your castles.  The more points you can win, the more you can lose.  The game also gives you the interesting option of choosing to work with or against (and it usually ends up being both) your opponent as you find your castles in the same row or column.

Not really convinced about FFG's Silver Line. Do I really want to pay $20 for a series of ultra-light, disposable games when for an extra few bucks I can buy something far meatier? I enjoyed this one (and got it for a good price), perhaps because it is Knizia. Light, but I enjoyed the level of guess-timiation required to win. Just quick enough not to get tiresome, as there isn't a whole lot to it. Incredibly inelegant scoring system though, with loads of adding and multiplying - far too much for such a lite game.

This new edition of Kingdoms isn't terribly different from the old one, but it does include a few variants that I think give the game some nice variety. 

I think the game is at it's best as a 2-player game, and a little too random with 4. The variants can help with the randomness, but the game loses some of it's charm if you play with revealed tiles. 

Overall: I really enjoy this tight little filler. It's a little random and a little mathy but it hits a certain sweet spot being so simple with loose mechanics. Very enjoyable.

Played here at BGG only.  Would like to try face to face game.  I don't like playing with hidden scores on line.

When you're only playing 1 turn a day, it seems silly to hide the scores.

Fun little abstract game I play sometimes with my GF. Basically, it feels like Lost Cities on a board. 

In your turn, you place either a new tile in a row or column, or you put in one of your castles 3 types of castles, in order to score the points for all tiles in that row or column(points x1, points x2, points x3). Fun thing, there are tiles with negative numbers so don't invest in (large) castles to early!

Also the game officially —I almost never do that— is played over 3 rounds. You only get your x1 score castles back, so you have to be strategic in placing those.

Kingdoms, without a doubt, has to be the worst Knizia game I've ever played. I generally enjoy most outings by Knizia, but this one seems to miss the mark on every level. Theme? What theme? Even by Knizia's standards this game is overly dry. Here's the dagger: a mind numbing math exercise that they call scoring. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if some people had to break out a calculator. Kingdoms is an earlier effort by the master that should be avoided.

Besides, there are some special tiles that give the game a very interesting twist.

Kingdoms -- The theme is cosmetic at most; and the theme may have no relation to the mechanics, but it does make for a colorful presentation. Yes, Kingdoms could have used a variety of themes, but unlike Hey! That's My Fish! (about which the same could be said) , this game DOES require a theme, if only to provide artwork, and a vocabulary framework to ease the teaching of the rules.  

The distribution of positive, negative and power tiles provides a good balance in each round. Not being able to re-use (in subsequent rounds) castle tokens whose value exceeds 1 makes the balance for the overall game interesting.

I tried it 2 player and didn't bother finishing the game. My friend and I have no problem playing T&E. When playing this game, there doesn't appear to be any meaningful decisions to make, aside from the obvious one of waiting a while before placing castles.

Every move seems preordained. Play bad pieces on opponents. Play good pieces on self. Place castles in big rows if you can.

The entirely random draw of the cards makes planning nigh impossible. The game would probably go up in value if each player had a choice of 3 cards to play each round, or something similar.

RATING: N/A
Initial impressions: This is a mathematical thinky game. The theme is more of an afterthought to the mechanics, but the artwork is very pretty and the plastic castles are a lot of fun.

I really want to see how the game dynamic changes with more than two players.

RATING: 7.5
Played a few games on the web and and liked it enough to buy my own copy. Simple core rules and even though the game is pretty "mathematical", the randomness of the tile draw removes pretty much all danger of analysis paralysis. Easy and fast to teach and play.

RATING: 7
5 plays. This is a good, fairly quick game. Theme is pasted on, but that doesn't matter with a good game. Have only played 2 player. Not sure if I'd like the chaos of multiplayer as what I like about the game is the tense strategic decisions and the mind game of outwaiting your opponent. Fantasy Flight version has decent production values which enhance the experience.

Most recent play in early 2005 with Garrett.

RATING: 6
Kingdoms version. FFG version has poorer quality components but is cheap.

The game plays very quickly and isn't that math crunching as I was led to believe. In typical Kniza fashion, players play castles (numbered 1-5) and tiles (with +, - or special modifiers) in order to score points.

The twist? High numbered castles that will allow high scores are used only once throughout the 3 rounds before being discarded.

There are a few 'take that' tiles and are deadly when combined with the block tiles. But all up, it plays fast yet isn't really satisfying.

Meglepően alulértékelt játék is a BGG-n, pedig nagyon jó. Pozitív és negatív értékű lapkákat raknak le a játékosok felváltva egy 6x5-ös táblára, plusz a kasatélyaikat, amin szorzók vannak. Ha a tábla betelt minden sort és minden oszlopot kiértékelünk. Van ezen kívül három különleges lap, ami megbolondítja a játékot. Nekem a Tigrist juttatta eszembe és még azt se mondanám, hogy annál egyszerűbb a játék. Ketten szinte sakkszerű, mert minden információ ismert is lehet. Talán az a veszélye megvan, hogy gyenge játékos mögött ülőnek jóval nagyobbak az esélyei, de négyen talán ez kompenzálható. Tetszett. Annyira nem, mint a Rosen és a Kamisado, de mindenképp jó darab.

RATING: 8
I upgraded my rating this one- I think its probably one of the best buys I made. It was inexpensive, easy to learn and good game play value.

Cons: Definitely, in true Reiner style, too much adding up at the end - folks, go out and buy a really cheap small calculator to keep in the box as you WILL need it. Not that I cant add, but theres so much of it and it can get out of hand- so calculator! The box is crap- its just an empty box space with no insert for managing bits, so when you're buying your calculator, buy some more zip lock baggies too. I think the theme in this is cute - not the intention I am sure! Was it supposed to be all warrior like? didnt really work, essentially the game greatness of Kingdoms could have been achieved with any theme which kind of lets you know it was a bit of a poor theme. The game bits and board are a bit rubbish and cheap -thank Reiner that its a good game, but the board should have been bigger with nicer pieces. But I guess it was suitable in its presentation for its price (though I would have spent extra for nicer components). 

Pros: Well, its a classic game. Its strategy is spot on and its perfect as a 2 player game as it gives each player a decent amount of placement turns. More players (plays up to 4) may be more difficult as you would get less placement turns as there are limited tiles, but I imagine this would add greatly to the depth of strategy.  I loved it and its the best buy I have made when you weigh everything up.

RATING: 7
Actually this a pretty decent little game. It's a reasonably quick filler game that plays out over three rounds. Similar to other Reiner Knizia games, it's fairly simple but suprisingly contains more strategy than expected. I'm not generally a fan of 'adding up scoring' games but this is fine and not clunky. My only quibble is I believe each round should contain ALL castles (not just the first round). Once someone has won the first round, it is extremely difficult for others to play catch-up in subsequent rounds and hence the game loses its excitement.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a wonderful game where you try hard to find the right balance of tiles to maximize points.  Great for someone with an analytical mind - others find the constant number crunching not so much fun ... but the hazards keep everyone in the game till the end.

This falls into the category of an area-control game somewhat.  Since the pieces that you play are in both a row and a column, you have a 2-D effect on your choices.  Lots of wronkage in this one, as there is ample opportunity to screw your opponents.  I find this one to be elegant, with lots of decisions packed into few rules.

With 2 players it's really random for what is really an abstract with no open information.  The push luck wasn't compelling and the scoring so close that decisions didn't seem to matter much.  It all came down to the special tile for me.

The first Euro I ever played and it nearly made me run from the room and never want to try another. Fortunately I persevered. Kingdoms reminds me of those games we used to play when I was a kid in gifted class to help our logic or math skills. Oddly enough, however, I would like to play it again because I would like to exercise that part of my brain every once in a while. In other words, I'll play it because it's good for me, like fish oil.

RATING: 6.5
[FFG 1994 Edition] {Fantasy, filler; tile-laying; optimal 4p} {6.5 basic game and all variants} Typical Knizia's scoring game. Kingdoms has nice player interaction with mild confrontation. It's an enjoyable filler for those who love calculation. It has quite good replayability because the board and tiles change each time.

Kingdoms is slightly luck dependent due to the tile draw. However, skillful playing of the castles and secret tile is more important to have high scores. Kingdoms is not deep, it's usually easy to determine the good location within a short time. 

The "Down to the last Castle" variant is as nice. I would play Kingdoms occasionally with this variant. I would not prefer the "No Luck" variant because it skews the game to basically calculative and destroys the fun.

The theme is so thin that it virtually doesn't exist. The quality of the components is ok, quite durable (but you can't expect much from the FFG Silver Line).

I like the idea of this game, but it is too dependent on the luck of the draw for my taste. The game seems to be usually decided by who draws the late dragon, +6, or -6.

I wonder if you eliminated the +/-5 and +/-6 tiles and doubled the amount of +/-1 and 2 if that would improve the game somewhat. It seems like it would less susceptible to wild swings of fortune.

A very pleasant little tile laying game. It seems entirely possible to win the game in one round and then play defensively for the remainder, but in a game this quick, I don't really see it as an issue.

It's almost certainly more fun when the dragon tile is drawn towards the end rather than at the beginning as it was in our first hand, but this is a minor quibble.

In summary: a good if not quite great filler.

This game creates an aroma - much like that of  being locked in a cramped closet surrounded by huge chunks of well aged sharp provolone cheese - that threatens to permeate your every pore.  In short,  it stinks.  Speaking of poor,  it is a perfectly apt description of this cardboard sleep inducer. 

In summation,  the game can best be described as fervently hoping that the player before you screws up, so you can score well. If this somehow sounds appealing to you....then by all means,  have at it.......

Or better yet,  save yourself some money and make your way to the nearest 99 cent store post haste.  Purchase a game of checkers and a mirror.  When it is your opponent's turn,  position the mirror on an angle between the sun and your opponent's eyes........and commence to merrily jump your plastic discs towards end row royalty.

I initially liked playing Kingdoms quite a bit, although it seems strange that others would enjoy such a purely mathematical exercise.  Probably needs just the right audience, but I happened to game with the very people that like this kind of thing.

I've tired of it after 8 plays, and traded it.  I would play it again, but I can't imagine choosing this over very many other games.

UPDATE: Picked up a copy of Auf Heller and Pfennig at an auction.  Don't quite know when it will hit the table, though.

About [thing=119][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=119][/thing] is an abstract tile placement game in which players lay down their castles in the richest regions of the realm, while at the same time trying to avoid the hazards.

Hey, didn't I mentioned that is an abstract? So what is this thing about castles, rich regions and hazards? Ah, I forgot to mention: is a Knizia game, so you now know that the theme is most likely thinly glued above a math exercize. And right you are!

But Knizia is also known by making balanced and smart games with minimal rules. This is also true here: a small set of rules allow for a highly interactive and even quite mean game - [thing=119][/thing] is from old Knizia design, a time in which he would smite the fool, make rain fire upon cities and ask for players to kill their first born in order to prove their worth.

[thing=119][/thing] is a fast going game, with players seeking to claim the best spots, and are constantly working together to score better and trying to put the others in the mud and kick them in the face.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
It is very simple. Each turn the player has two options: either put a tile on the board or a castle. Tiles are drawn blindly, but once the player see it, it is up to her in which spot to put it - tiles are usually for points (positive or negative), with some specials mixed in (like the mine, which double the points (even the negative ones), the wizard, which makes the castle bigger, the dragon, that prevents the score of the row and column it is, etc).

The castles is the way players score. There are castles with 1, 2, 3 and 4 towers. The player receives points for the row and column a castle is, multiplied (yes, again even the negative) by the number of towers it has. Say a row has a +5, +3, -6, and a column has -5, -3, +2 and +1, and you have a castle with 2 towers in the intersection of them - for the row you would receive 4 points (5+3-6= 2x2) and for the column you would lose 10 points (2+1-3-5= -5x2). Tough.

The game lasts for 3 rounds, and a round ends when the board is full. Scores are tallied. The players receive back the castles with 1 tower they used - all castles with 2 or more towers can be only used once.

After three rounds the player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Though there are only two options for the player each turn, both have connecting decisions. If the choice is for a tile, the placement of it is key - as you will either try to take advantage of it if it is good, or to hurt your opponents, but must place it even if you won't be able to gain from it, so, instead, you will try to place it somewhere the others won't be able to milk as much.

For the castles, thing are usually easier, as the place for them tends to be clearer, but the choice of moment to use the bigger castles (with 2, 3 or 4 towers) is very important, not only because you have a limited number of them, but also in an acessmment of risk and reward, as a place that starts all well and good can turn out a terrible spot to be on - now multiply this!

Neither are particularly hard choices to do, but both are important and carry weight.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very easy to teach and to play;
- Highly interactive;
- Language independant;
- Small box, making it quite portable;
- Scales well between 2 and 4 players.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Luck of the draw while taking tiles has a sizeable role;
- The high interaction can make some players angry, as there is a good amount of screwage going back and forth;
- Light, but constant calculations;
- No real connection between gameplay and theme.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like closing a contract with architect Diotisalvi, after getting some sweet piece of land to build your castle. It will be awesome - great towers, strong wall, a nice drawbridge. Everything seems to be proper. Than place starts to tilt. Well, at least you have that summer palace, in a very good spot... Then a dragon appears. It is about now that one should consider looking into a long lived family curse.

In [thing=119][/thing] there will be hurt feelings and quick vengeance. No one will leave the table without blood on their hands. At least there are some opportunities to balance the karma, while placing good tiles for someone else (and possibly also you). Still, [thing=119][/thing] won't ever be that sort of "you do your thing, I do mine, and we meet in the end" game. No. You will want to take advantage of others are doing, along with trying to salt the land where they live without you, with the kicker of making efforts to conceal a resort all for your own use.

[thing=119][/thing] won't be a game that will fit well with many: too much interaction in a destructive way, too much luck, too dry and mathy. But there also those that think there is such a thing as too much icecream. I see myself a fan of game with a good level of interaction, and I notice I was considering punching the game on the face (it is the lid of the box, of course), but then I receive a +4 in a line I had a 2 towers castle, and my anger as abated. Probably not the best for family gaming time - I just know that if my brother and I played [thing=119][/thing] when we were younger, one of us would had murder the other, but we were the type of brothers that communicate through punches.

In the end, [thing=119][/thing] gets a restricted recommendation, as it works well for its intended purposes, while also serving pretty nicely as a teaching tool. And at the same time will be completely wrong to many, achieving feelings ranging from upset to contempt to its mathy and dry ways. Proceed with caution.

Interesting tile laying abstract by Mr Knizia. The third edition has good quality components, even though the artwork is very generic fantasy fare and I wonder if they could not have come up with a more suitable (pasted on) theme. The game itself is easy to learn and all about calculating risk and strategic positioning with very mathematical scoring rounds. Sounds dry, but my 10 year old son has taken quite a fancy to it as a two player game. Good filler.

This game is deceptively simple and easy, but like all Knizia games, there are many subtle and strategic moves one can make. While luck of the draw plays a part, planning ahead helps. Highly recommended as a filler.

I picked up this game at DragonCon 04.  I really expected this game to be like a multi-player Lost Cities.  Based on a single two player game, it seems to fall short.  I got to try a four player game, and it was a little more interesting and surprisingly, it didn't get bogged down.  Unfortunately, I think it didn't get bogged down because no one was interested enough to really think about their moves.  It was way too dry.  I traded the game for Drakon.

Knizia dr. közel 20 éves játékában egy 5X6-os rácson helyezünk el pozitív és negatív pontértékű lapkákat, vagy a saját kastélyainkat. Ha a tábla betelt, minden kastélyunk annyi pontot hoz, amennyi a vele egy sorban/oszlopban lévő lapkák értéke, szorozva a kastély tornyainak (1 és 4 között) számával. Ez ismétlődik még kétszer, a legtöbb pont nyer. Van pár különleges lap, ami hatással van a pontozásra, és a jobb kastélyok csak egyszer használatosak, de nagyjából ennyi a játék.
Meglepően élvezhető játék, de két kisebb gond azért akad vele. A tematika mondvacsinált, lehetne ugyanez az űrben, vagy a tőzsdén, pályaudvaron, akárhol. Kevés a játékosok közötti interakció is, igazából egy szó nélkül végig lehetne játszani, ha a kiértékeléseknél nem lenne közös számolgatás. Ezek mellett is megérné beszerezni, de az ára elég borsos a tartalomhoz viszonyítva.

Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace that looks remarkably like a plain matrix for square tiles. Each turn, players place tiles onto the board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.

In Kingdoms, the English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile – one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores – previously available only at game conventions.

I was expecting a breezy tile-layer like Carcassonne, and was shocked to discover how nasty this game is. (This isn't a bad thing necessarily, just unexpected.) A lot of agonizing decisions, and the randomness seems to be at the right level; you can calculate odds pretty effectively, but won't know for sure how things will go. The production values are pretty poor objectively, and especially by (current) Fantasy Flight standards. I'm also a little concerned about replay value. Still, this is one of the tensest experiences I've had with a simple ruleset, and a quick playing time adds to the appeal.

A fairly light game that my family enjoys. It is a very tactical game with wild swings in what can happen during the round. Long term planning does not help except in managing your 2-4 point castle usage during the 3 rounds. Like several of the FFG Silver Line games this is a good amount of fun for the money.

This is a solid, if mathy, tile laying game.  Trying to balance getting a good scoring position for your pieces with waiting long enough to let the board develop safe good positions is interesting... and the special tiles spice things up enough to keep you attentive to every tile flip.  I'm not sure if I'd like it more or less with an open set of tiles to choose from (we only played the basic random tile variant) as I know I'd like having more control, but might miss the suspense of the tile draw.

All in all a solid, quick game.

RATING: 7
A fascinating little tile laying game that is deceptively simple yet filled with tough choices.  Do you lay down your castle and open yourself up to possible negative points from others, or do you play a tile in the hopes you aren't setting your opponents up for a lucrative spot?  It is made even more interesting with the inclusion of 4 special tiles that often produce unexpected results.  I could be wrong in this assessment but I found subtle similarities to abstract games such as Go and Chess in that positioning is very important.

Yes there is a lot of randomness, but some of it is controlled, since you get to choose where to place what you drawn (except late in the game when spaces become limited).  The biggest frustration lies in poor plays however, and I think the problem could be further compounded if someone continually give up prime locations to the person after him.

Teljesen jó volt, látom benne a fantáziát, és tetszik a többi játékossal való interakció. A társaságban van belőle, így nem kell megvennem szerencsére. :)

Jó kis agyalás ment négyesben, jó meccsek voltak.

After 1 Play: An unremarkable filler.  You can't really make moves with an eye toward the future, because your opponent can always take any opportunity you set up.

I like this as a 2-player game.

Elegant but hard game. That's why my girlfriend doesn't like this one ;-)

This game is a little dry.  I play it on BGG to pass the time, and it's pretty fun to put the evil eye on someone who's just laid out their IV, or put a mountain down between their piece and 16 points, but I don't care to own it and wouldn't miss it too much if it went away.

I love the simplicity and depth at the same time. All in numbers, but not calculative.

RATING: 7
Seems to be a fantasy chess in a dungeon with a cool theme which sounds interesting to me ;). With the additional plastic miniatures and for a good price at Essen 2008 I couldn't resist.

This is how the regular version should have been. If you see it somewhere, buy it!

Initial Rating: 10.0 (September 2017)

Dungeon Twister is my favorite game of all time so I have tried to buy everything for it (I´m still missing some goodies). This collector edition was one of the few missing items I had, so I spent a lot of money hunting down a copy and now I have a German copy of the game. I really didn’t know what came in the box, so I was a bit disappointed to find out it was exactly the same as the original Dungeon Twister plus some miniatures and the coveted (at least by me) Amazon character (which was why I bought the collector box in the first place). It also adds a certificate for a club, but I think it closed its doors long ago.
 
The collector box is a big, mostly empty box. I think its size was meant to store all the content for the game but a friend custom made a special box for my complete Dungeon Twister collection so I won’t be using it. I thought I was never going to play it but as it happened, a friend wanted to play it and I didn’t have my regular collection at hand so we unpunched it and that was when the nightmare began. We couldn’t punch it without using a blade and even then some of the rooms and characters are clearly marked, which is very bad for the game as you need to deploy them secretly. Very disappointed by this. Also the miniatures have leftover plastic material that needs to be removed. In any case, I prefer to play without miniatures. There wasn’t enough plastic stands for all the characters. I was expecting better from the collector’s edition and there is no one I can complain about this.

Anything else remains the same and you can read the comment under the Dungeon Twister entry (I said it was the best game ever, with very low luck and hard to master). I still haven’t played with the Amazon character, when do I will come back and comment on it.

Bottom line, I was disappointed by the quality of the miniatures and the tiles. They got damaged when I punched them. I’m not sure if this happens in all the editions or only the German one. Still, Dungeon Twister is my favorite game and this edition has everything you need to play the very first game, so I love it nonetheless and I will never sell it.

Purchased on BGG - German copy and no english translations on BGG for the bulk of the text. This will be fun.

Some of the miniatures have been damaged (and not replaced), but I like the visual improvement.

Game itself:
One of the best boardgames i´ve played! Great value!

Edition:
My edition came without broken parts; the huge box can store game parts and minis for all my dungeon twister stuff: Prison, Forces of Darkness (incl. 1 set of minis) & Paladins & Dragons (incl. 1 set of minis).

Really hard to rate this one. Same game like "normal" Dungeon Twister. But a huge nearly empty box, some unnecessary stuff and dishonoured promises made by Asmodee for future extras. So my ratings would be: 7 for the game, but for this ridiculous version only 1 point. So I rate it with the average of 4.

Not rating this. The game is probably fine, but the German collector's edition is a big rip-off. Bought it for the minis when it was on offer, but they are just (VERY light) plastic mini figures. (What, they say that's resin? Whatever. Looks and feels like plastic to me.) I had expected pewter at least for this price (even when on offer). Plus the box is RIDICULOUSLY oversized, about 4 times larger than necessary. A lot of air, which also describes this product. Thoroughly regret buying this. The only thing worth while are the minis, which I added to my English version.

If I would rate the support of Pro-Ludo, it would be a rating of about one or two :(

Really fun game, will play again soon!

I'm glad I didn't pay full price for the collector. 
Although the mini's are nice, only the 8 basic characters seem available.

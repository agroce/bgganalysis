An interesting little race game.  I didn't find it to be anything amazing, but it was reasonably fun.  Played with the black rose expansion, which added a little more excitement, but I don't think anyone but me used it to any significant effect (and I just recharged my coal with it).

Personally, I found this fun, but it's maybe not a good one for non-gamers.  Several I've tried it with hated it.  I like the way you don't know what's going to be around the next bend in the river and that you have to think hard about when the best time to pick up passengers is.  A thinking man's race game, for sure, but it's MUCH better with the Black Rose expansion.

I like this game, because it's a very nice game to introduce others to playing board games:

Simple rules
beautyful tiles/components
not too long (apx. 1 hr)
interaction through pushing other players
a little strategy (adjusting speed and spend coal for extra movements)
a little luck (you don't know where the river will continue)

All in all, for more experienced players it might be too light, but for new players or players which do not play very often it's really nice.

The game itself is great!  Very little luck, but lots of options.  Great to play in a group (the more the better), and games *should* be short.  I say should because the two games I&#039;ve played so far involved at least one drunk at the table.  Ug.  As long as everyone is paying attention the turns go quite quick.

The only complaint I have is the quality of the components.  The boards/dice/box are great.  The boats are utter crap - the colors are washed, lots of white plastic bits stuck to them and the steam towers were broken on two from the start.  Here&#039;s a nickel kid, buy a better production plant...

Clever modular board and nice use of theme.  I enjoy the tactical route selection as well as the resource management & blocking.  The bits could be a bit more hefty as the smoke stacks snap.

It's a FUN, simple, racing game!

It has management of limited ressources, it has BEAUTIFUL components, it has a little luck, it has almost no downtime and it can easily be scaled down by removing some tiles. Easy enough for new gamers and can give a challenge to veteran gamers. You want to make it more challenging? Well then, use the Black Rose expansion, and make it even better!

[b]Spiel des Jahres 1997[/b]
[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Deutscher Spiele Preis 4th Place 1997[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 10/18/05, Rated: 6[/i]

The first [i]Spiel des Jahres[/i] (SdJ) winner that I just wasn't crazy about after playing.  The riverboats are cool little game pieces, and I can see them being the "gimmick" that helped this game to win the SdJ.

Planning ahead is hard to do, especially if you are the front runner.  The first person to reach the farthest tile gets to place the next one, but only [i]after[/i] she has finished moving.  Often the tile placement will require a sharp turn, or introduce an obstacle directly in front of you.  This uncertainty means the person in the lead should cross a new tile at a speed of "3" or "4," or else she will be running out of coal fast as she slams on the brakes.  Laggards can be much more efficient.  This is a natural mechanism that keeps the players relatively close together, but at the same time it is in conflict with the "racing" nature of the game.

The extreme sensitivity to coal levels wouldn't be so bad if it were possible to fill your bunkers at a station.  Perhaps a house rule (or an out of print expansion) will remedy this oversight.

[i]Mississippi Queen[/i] is a simple enough game that looks great and has some innovative pieces.  Still, after having played it a few times now, I am left with a feeling of "is that all?"  Old Man River may just keep rolling...alone.

[i]Updated: 10/20/05, Rated: 7[/i]

Okay, I have a few more games at the helm.  Turn order determination of the full game (with passengers) fosters a breakaway leader problem.  I still have some concerns, but it is an enjoyable experience.

Time for me to shorten these comments by writing a full-fledged review.

At one point I would have said that race games are not my cup of tea, yet this is one more example that seems to be proving me wrong. The way the river boats move is very logical, and planning how to properly manuever yourself down the river is almost like solving a puzzle. Adding in the need to pick up some passengers along the way does a great job forcing players to plan out their movements, and also it can serve as a good catch-up mechanism. I love how the river slowly reveals as you move downstream. It makes for a thematically relaxing ride down the river, which is crazy considering this is a race game. This is one of those rare games that, only halfway through playing, my wife said "we need to own this game." The components are great, and they really bring out the theme as well. The rules are dead simple once you get rolling down the river, and we found that even someone with a massive lead is never guaranteed a victory. It has some similarity to Formula D, but is definitely different enough to warrant owning both.

A good race game that I will have to teach my Bro and Sis in law.  I think they would enjoy it as we all like race games to a certain extent.

RATING: 10
I generally like 'racing' games and this one is great. The theme fits perfectly (with pit stops as passengers to pick up). There is a definite hare/tortoise element as the front runner has to commit to the river before knowing which way the river will bend. Bit fiddly working out the ending, but that is a minor complaint.

Definitely helps having the expansion though - extra river tiles and re-coaling really add to the game (not sure about using the black rose to hamper the leader though, makes the game take too long)

It is somewhat fun though to max out the speed of your boat and just smash into things at full speed.  It's what I'd do if I were piloting a real river boat.  Or steam boat.  Or whatever it's supposed to be.

Blocking is very important, so a game with more players is a lot more interesting than with only a few. If only two want to play, maybe try each player running two boats.

This is a cracking race game - easy to see how it won the SdJ as it's a lot of fun.  Arguably there's not a lot to it but anyone complaining about the lack of strategy is missing the point ... and probably the win, which is all the matters here.  Beautifully produced too.

Worth an extra half mark when played with 'The Black Rose', which adss some fun options without adding too much to the length of the game (so long as you don't use all the tiles, especially not with a full complement of players).

Now, I'll grant you that for the serious gamer, Mississippi Queen is not going to set your world alight. BUT, it is simple (once you figure out the turn-order rules - the original Rio Grande translation is awful), fun, and easy for just about anyone to play. And it doesn't have the usual flaws that plague race games: you can catch up once behind, and there are different viable strategies. It's no El Grande in terms of replayability, but it is one of the few "bigger but light" games I that I have enjoyed repeatedly, and is good clean fun without being too chaotic.

RATING: 6
The more I think about this game, the more pissed off it makes me.  Such a great concept, and really it IS a fun game - up until the end.  Since you have to pull in to the finish line going slowly, the people behind you, having nothing to lose, simply ram you and move you out of a winning position. It's never failed and for me it ruins what would otherwise be a nice little game.

Update: Just tried it with a house rule of no ramming on the final tile and it's a bit better.

Great fun at first, since it feels and plays entirely different to other boardgames - so I bought it immediately. However, after a a couple of games it starts to get a bit boring: The feel of a proper "race" does not get through to me. Games like "TransAmerica" or "Thurn&Taxis" feel much more like "racing". It has it's place though, as it plays fairly quick and is easily explained.

This is one of the reasons why SdJ cannot be trusted.  This game just isn't very good for gamers.  I love the calculation aspect of the game.  That is actually very clever.  But basically the only interaction between players is a total screwage rule.  Even worse, the rule is totally 180 degrees from the theme, literally.  I have never seen a steamboat approach another boat from the rear and is able to push it backwards.  Why does this rule need to be there?  Why can't this just be about river navigation?  A person (let's just say me, because it happened to me) leads the race the whole way, rolls for new tiles because they are first, plans for each path the river can take, makes basically no mistakes in navigation the whole way, can lose this game very easily to somebody who can ram them at the end.  Suddenly, this allows a boat to go backwards?  Where are we? on f*cking Neptune?  What a waste of time.

Nice introductory race game with very few rules. Rather pretty modular boards and paddle steamers. The pushing rule whereby you can 'push' another steamer backwards whilst your steamer goes forwards feels a bit gamey. I would prefer it if it were only possible to push other steamers either directly ahead or ahead and to the side (0 or 60 degrees from the pushing ship's course).

Rated "7" after one play. Right now, its' a tossup between this and Formula D as my favorite racing game. I loved the "push your luck" pedal to the metal feel of Formula D, but it lacks the positioning, crowded maneuvering, and blocking of Mississippi Queen. 

I really like how the river gradually reveals itself throughout the game. I also dig the need to pick up passengers to avoid a runaway leader problem. And, like Formula D, coal (not tires or engine points) acts as a limited resource allowing you to push ahead further at those critical moments when you need an edge.

There's no point for me to try and find a favorite. Both are fun. Racing games aren't my "must play" games, but they fit a nice niche.

We play 2-player with the Black Rose expansion.  I really wanted to love this game.  The theme is nice and the board is great.  But for some reason, it just isn't that exciting to play.  The pieces are neat looking, but not practical.  Several of the boats were already broken when we bought the game brand new, because of the very thin smokestacks on them.  I am clumsy and can seldom change the dials on the boat without picking the whole thing up.

This game fills a nice niche, a short game with simple rules that you can have up and running in less than 5 minutes with new players.  Also is good for a "less aggressive" game group (like my wife) who do not enjoy adversarial games as much.  For its simplicity, the game is still very enjoyable and well-balanced.  Probably for heavy-weight gamers...Mississippi Queen may lack a little substance.  But its fun and an excellent filler game before or after something heavy.

RATING: 8
In short, this is a racing game complicated by the fact that you're piloting a big paddlewheel boat.  So it can't turn easily and its speed can only increase and decrease a little each turn.  If you want more out of the boat, you have to burn your precious coal supply.

To make things more interesting, along the way you have to pick up two lovely ladies (Southern belles complete with parasols).  And the river route only becomes clear as you travel down the river - which way will it bend next?  Only the included die knows.

Great parts, well-integrated theme, and good fun.  Just be ready to get a bit nasty!

Similar in mechanic to Formula De, but it goes a lot faster and (in my humble opinion) is more fun.  The random river generation helps even out a game which could otherwise have the "runaway leader" syndrome.  Of course, that also can lead to unfair advantage.

Good theme and mechanics for a race game, basically taking Formula D off of the fixed track and creating more interesting opportunities for collisions.  The "Black Rose" expansion is strongly recommended for added chaos and "come-from-behind" effects.  I do think it would be better if cut shorter by a hex or two - there's not QUITE enough 'there' for as long as it takes to play out.  An aside: only picking up southern dames seems a bit odd - where are the top hats?

Pretty fun, light, and about Mississippi is all I can say about this one.  I enjoy it, but it is no where near my favorite.  I was also surprised at the fact that my younger cousin did not like the game and thought it was exceedingly boring.  I figured since it was to me so simple that it would be a good game for her.  It was not.  I am not sure why, though.  Good game if you do not want to think too hard.

Place race paddle steamers down the Mississippi River.  On a player's turn they can set their steamer's speed, possibly burning up their precious supply of coal in the process.  Then they move their steamer 1-6 spaces down the river.  The river is constructed using jigsaw pieces as the race progresses, so you never know which way the river will bend.  Great race game, with little luck and beautiful presentation.  One of the great "hook" games to get new people into the hobby.

Játszottam már régebben is ezzel a játékkal, de most kipróbáltuk a családdal (3 fő). Szerintem megérdemelten nyert SDJ-t a játék, mert egy nagyszerű családi "race game", kevés, jól érthető szabállyal (habár a kedves Anyukám nehezen értette meg, hogy nem lehet csak úgy össze-vissza forogni büntetlenül :)) és egy remek, izgalmas játékmenettel. A játék egy gőzös versenyről szól a mississippi folyón. Az nyer aki hamarabb célba ér (milyen meglepő), de közben két utast is fel kell venni a fedélzetre, ami épp kellőképpen bonyolítja meg a versenyt. A játékban lehet lökdösődni, ami a sértődősöknek kellemetlen lehet, szerintem viszont a játék "fun" faktorát emeli. Minden körben szabadon fordulhatunk egyet (60 fokot) (a pálya hexagonokból épül fel) és növelhetjük vagy csökkenthetjük a sebességünket. Természetesen több egységgel is változtathatjuk a sebességünket vagy irányt, de ezért egy 6 egységből álló szénkészletből kell "fizetni". Ha ez a készlet teljesen elfogy és arra kényszerülnénk, hogy újra használni kelljen, akkor kiesünk a játékból, ezért nem érdemes idő előtt elpazarolni. A mindenkori változatosságot az biztosítja, hogy a pálya (folyó) alkalmanként véletlenszerűen máshogy épül fel a 12 folyószakaszból. A játék 3 fővel nem olyan izgalmas, de kipróbáltuk, hogy mind az 5 hajóval versenyeztünk, ami sokkal izgalmasabb futamot eredményezett, cserébe a játékidő is megnyúlt másfél órára, amit észre sem lehetett venni a játék izgalmában :). Gyakorlatilag ennyi. Egyszerű, de nagyszerű. Minden családnak szívből ajánlom, akik szeretnek versengeni. (2014.09.21.)

This is a fun racing game with a bit of forward thinking and resource management involved. The downside to the game is that for whatever reason some people that I've played this with have really struggled because of the forward planning involved. It's a race game but you need to stop at times to pick up passengers and you're limited on how fast you can speed up and accelerate you need to plan a turn or to ahead, plot your course and what speed you need to be at. And that's what makes bumping so powerful! Being able to throw someone off their ideal path. But alas for whatever reason people seem to have an issue "seeing" the game. Which means it doesn't see the table as often.

A mediocre game with pretty components. The number stickers that go on the wheels are annoying because the ends peel back easily and then they get caught when you adjust the wheel. I may paint clear nail polish on them. The race itself isn't bad, but it's nothing to get excited over. Once you understand the mechanics and know how to set up a passenger pickup, thwart an opponent's pickup, etc., it becomes rather scripted without a great deal of strategy. Then it's a matter of risk taking. How fast do you want to go, not knowing what's ahead? Not a bad game overall but I expected more based on the price and the nice components. Used to own, traded.

Pretty good game.  I'm happy I have it, as it's excellent as a gateway, and particularly w/ the Black Rose so a 6th can play.  I like how the river changes directions, and the movement/turning mechanic is neat.

É um jogo de corrida. Cada jogador é o capitão de um barco a vapor e deve manobrá-lo Mississipi abaixo administrando a velocidade e reserva de carvão. Pelo caminho você deve embarcar dois passageiros. Ainda da para dar uns empurrões nos adversários para atrapalhar. Quem chegar primeiro vence. Rápido e fácil de jogar. Muito legal o jogo.

Mississippi Queen has all the ingredients for a great game: nice steam boat racing theme, quality bits, frantic decisions and maneuvring for the best places, and lots of screwage potential (though that would probably have to take a back seat in your average game with the family). Yet it still falls short. The movement mechanism works reasonably well and there is refreshingly little luck - until you get to the next river segment. As small as the luck element here may be, it still means that the current leader usually cannot simply race full steam ahead. This in turn means the pursuers usually catch up without problems after picking up passengers.

As a result the pack is usually very close together before the last one or two segments so that the game in essence is reduced to clever maneuvering in the last couple of turns. The 80% of playing time before that simply don't matter (unless you imprudently burnt all your coal before this in which case you can just as well go home already). That is a pity because the racing aspect deserves something more fun.

I got ripped off when I bough this on Amazon. The person that sold it said it was in excellent condition. It was not, and I felt like I had been lied to. Two of the masts were broken on 2 ships, and it's missing a black water wheel. The box had a split in the seam too. Of course Amazon takes the blame for it, and that seller gets away with it. I wanted to send it back but it's too hard to find a good copy of this game. 

I don't know if I'll ever find good parts for it, and I really wanted this game because I love river games like this.

RATING: 7
Solid gameplay.  One needs to think several moves ahead to do well.  There are usually some opportunities for conflict with other players, especially when taking on passengers.

If I have one complaint, it would be that the choice of overall strategies is limited.  You really need to keep towards the middle of the pack for most of the game (being in the lead is a disadvantage, because you have the least amount of time to react to new river tiles).  As a result, most games play out fairly similarly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a fun light game. Easy to teach and easy to learn. You have to decide to get the belles early and then move up the river, or try to get up the river quicker and pick up belles along the way. Trouble with that is that someone may beat you to them and by the time you get there, the "ladies" have been picked up by someone elses steamboat. I played my first time with the BLACK ROSE EXPANSION and wouldn't play without it. We all really liked the sandbars and log tiles. We were playing nice in the beginning, but what added some excitement was when you start to push people off course or into the logs or sandbars. Yes, you have to take another point to do that, but sometimes it's just worth it. You never know how game will end. The person who was way behind all of us, ended up winning, as he picked up his belles first and noone in his way, so he could move right along. Really fun game. Would highly recommend it. BLACK ROSE EXPANSION is OOP, so if you see it, get it!

[Original comment] I really like this game, although I have great difficulty winning it. I like the changing gameboard, with a somewhat different one each game. I like the requirement to make decisions regarding speed, turning, when to pick up a passenger, and when to consider bumping another boat. An excellent family game.

May 2009 -- We haven't played this game in a while, but I always look forward to playing it. It isn't a difficult game, but the finishes can be exciting.

October 2011 -- We only play this occasionally, because it is limited to 5 or fewer players, and we usually have at least 6 players. I continue to enjoy it everytime we play.

2013-November: Rarely get a chance to play this, but I like it when we do.

Mississippi Queen is a fun, light race game that you can get just about anyone to play. The river roll up is a great mechanic and everyone loves to see which way he river will turn and what features it has. There is some strategy in here too, but not so much that new players will struggle against experienced ones. It looks great too.

RATING: 7.5
Genuinely fun racing game.  The limited coal supply plus the the need to stop twice during the race make for an interesting twist, but the game is still easy enough to teach in 5 minutes.  If you only play to see who gets first place, the last turn can be skipped, as a winning position is obvious.  However, this is one that I enjoy seeing all the positions resolve. An unlucky turn in the river can hurt, but I have fun even when I'm dead last.

A pretty enjoyable game of players jockeying for position on the Mighty Mississip to pick up passengers and be the first to make it to the destination. The eyes of more than one player in our group lit up when we learned you could ram and displace other players' boats. Balance speed against coal conservation to manuever around the islands and make it to the end. A lightweight diversion that's fun for a few plays and would make for a good relaxing evening with a group of friends.

As one who has lived along the Mississippi River nearly all my life, this game has a special place in my heart due to theme. Clever board concept. I like the way the way the river changes directions. Even if it doesn't necessarily affect gameplay, it does give a visual sense of travel down the river.

RATING: 6
Fun race game with the added dimension of resource management. The leader's advantage is nicely limited by not being able to see what the next river tile will be until he has completed his full move onto what is currently the last tile. The game is considerably improved by the expansion set. End game can be marred somewhat by degenerating into a bump-fest but it plays fast and no one is taking it so seriously in any case.

More fun race than I'd expect from the theme.  Good strategic choices to make and it doesn't take all day to play.  Nice ships and other components.  My one game with 4 was more of a brutal ramming match than the owner expected.    It was my fault, though because I wanted cannons and boarding parties, so I had to go with what I had.  Glad everyone else got into the crashing spirit with me. :)  Wish it was still in print.

Unlike most race games, this also has a nice catch up mechanism for anyone who's behind.  If I recall correctly, the new River tile isn't placed until the last player enters the forward most board.  Ergo, the player in the lead could possibly be pointing in the wrong direction!  :)

It's nice to see a race game with low luck factor and no dice-based movement. It allows a little planning and you have to manage your limited coal supply.

This is a nice race game, with the slight twist that the leader does not always know which way the river will go.  Outside of that, it is a perfect information, no luck game.  The play forces you to plan ahead, and manage your resources.  It is cute, and has fairly easy rules.  Finally, the "bumper car" aspect gives a significant amount of player interraction.  

The only downside is that it does not reward bad decsisions.  Also, you can get so far behind that you can never catch up.  

I suggest this for family and moderately heavy game players. I also highly suggest that you pick up the "Black Rose" expansion, which adds variability and a couple more boats to the game.  The more the merrier!

Racing game in which the track is built as the players move from one board to another.

At some point in the race, you need to slow down and stop at two islands to pick up two ladies; a way to prevent you from going full-speed the whole time. It seems that being in the lead can actually give you a slight disadvantage, depending on how the board develops (you aren't able to plan as well). So far the games I have played have been fairly close up to the end; the person you thought would take first didn't always.

Played my 2nd game July 17th, 2007.  I have been trying to get this on the table for over a month and we played it today.  My first impression was about right.  It's ok and there's lots of games I would rather play.  The rules were confusing since I hadn't refreshed my memory.  It plays in about 45 minutes for 5 players once you've got the rules down.  The beginner's game is too short and not worth playing.  There is some strategy in it, however it seems that luck or how much take-that you incurr will be more of the story.  Overall, I was dissappointed because it seemed like a game that we'd take to with the take-that element, however it didn't seem to play well for us.  I'd only recommend playing it if you know someone who has it, however I wouldn't go out of your way to do it.

What a great, fun game! It takes 2 seconds to explain the rules, even to non-gamers, and then the fun can begin - and what eventful, challenging, stimulating fun it is!
Played 2 players using the 2UP rules from Black Rose. Even my missus loved it - she started out feeling under the weather and not in the mood to learn a game, but by the end of it was giggling like a schoolgirl and having a great old time of it. :)

One of only a few games where the phrase "Ramming Speed! Bom-Bom Bom-Bom!" can validly by used in excess! :D

I'm not crazy about most race games.  This one is fun and easy to explain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The right amount of confrontation and interference, not too long a time, simple rules prompting a little (but not too much) contemplation of your options each turn. I'm enjoying the variation the random river tile placement gives but the random element doesn't even remotely overwhelm the deliberate decision making. And the very slight hinderance of not knowing what's coming puts the brakes just a little on whichever boat is furthest along the course. All in all a very nicely designed game.

One thing we're noticing is the bits are physically fiddly... the passengers are inclined to fall off and the wheels don't always turn easily. And in this second game we were still having trouble remembering which boats have already moved each turn. I will make some custom adjustments to track all this better... something similar to the "cabins" in the Black Rose expansion, and some markers we can drop on the boats to show which ones have moved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this one much more than my group. It's a nice game of management and position. I like the changing river and the components are pretty good.

I wish I could get it played a bit more. It's not heavy and I keep thinking people will like it, but it's not for everyone I guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice race game. Judging when to make your bid for the front is the trick. Do it too early and you're likely to come unstuck when the river bends the wrong way, leave it too late and you'll be playing to avoid the wooden spoon. (2003)
-----------------------------------
Played again for the first time in years and found it pretty tedious. The little hexagonal wheels that track speed and coal (the only things of significance in your boat) slip round too easily ('3 coal? I thought I had 5 left?' etc.)

It's OK but there are better racing games

Just acquired, and I must say this may be the most overlooked "entry" game.  Large amounts of control, simple rules, and short playing time.  Yet there are still meaty decisions to be made.
Two more games tonight (this time with 3).  Even with three, where there is less interaction, it was a fine light game for 35 minutes.
And I mean _great_ for introducing new gamers to the hobby.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun racing game in which the boats on each turn can normally change speed by one and can rotate by one hex side. The river keeps appearing as you advance so you don't know what to expect. Burning coal can allow a bigger change in speed or turning, but you only start with six and should save some for the end of the race. Also you need to slow down to pick up two Southern bells. We played with the Black Rose expansion.

On the 19th of February 2011, I found this game at Sci-Fi City in Knoxville Tennessee. I was shocked. This game has been out of print for some time, and there it was new in shrink. Now, I pledged that I would limit my purchases from brick and mortar stores, but Sci-Fi City were having a "buy two get one free" sell. I walked out with Mississippi Queen, Small World, and Snow Tails for about $110. This is a little more than I would have paid online, I know, but I also probably couldn't have found Mississippi Queen online for as reasonable a price.

RATING: 6
Fun, light racing game that plays quickly and allows players to be as competitive as they like.  When we played it was more like bumper boats than racing.  It really needs the Black Rose expansion to become challenging, but as a family game I think it works well.  For some reason the linear nature of the race is more interesting to me than a circular track - it seems like you're actually making progress towards a goal, which can be frustrating with tracks on which you have to do multiple laps.

Update: While I find it enjoyable, I seem to be in the minority.  Traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An easy to play race game thats fun, but feels a bit limited. There isn't much to do except adjust your speed and move hexes. Even with the passenger rules, the game felt a bit simple. Still, its a good filler than can be played in half-an-hour and the pieces look fantastic.

A light, fun racing game that can be a real joy to play.  It does fall down a bit though, in that even though it is a "race" game, the best position to be in is dead last until about 4\5ths of the way through the race.  Still a fun game that can be a good "gateway" game to introduce people to gaming with.

I liked the "Fog of War" the game provides, where you never know what tile is ahead...and sometimes screws the leader if he's on the wrong side.  One thing this game does well is slow the leader down, cause if you're in the lead, you have to go before everyone, which means leader has the least amount of time to adjust your course.

Acquired pre-2003. Total number of plays > 30. Fast, simple and fun racing game with an unpredictable race track. The player-in-the-lead-moves-first coupled with the way river tiles are revealed fit very well together. Only drawback is the boats. The dials don't turn smoothly especially when carrying passengers. (Don't put the passengers on the boat as suggested in the rules.) I do really enjoy this game though.

I was glad I was finally able to score a chance to play Mississippi Queen. I do have an affinity for all racing games, and this is a really well thought out and streamlined design of a racing game. Its more complex than Ave Caesar, but still not very complex at all. The components are well done and quite pleasing to the eye all told, with the one nagging point of the scale being a little too large which makes the game require a largish table to play on(one particular nice touch is the "southern belle" plastic minis). The decision tree is pretty simple, but the choices can be agonizing and sometimes you are risking the whim of the die. Sometimes that die goes your way and you open up and even larger lead, or it is against you and you have to turn your paddle boat around and head in the opposite direction. Overall I really enjoyed Mississippi Queen and would probably pick it up if it was in print and sold at normal prices, but since I have plenty of other racing games and this one is somewhat hard to acquire I feel I can skip picking it up. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Race game with clever movement mechanics that still ultimately fell a little flat for me.  Easy to admire as an elegant design but not particularly fun. I am not a race game fan in general though so perhaps that lowers my rating a bit.

Fun and strategic, but the random turning of the river really hurts whoever is in the lead.  It's best to hang back and then jump ahead at the end.

RATING: 8
The remarkable thing about this game is how it handles the runaway leader problem inherent in most racing games. In this game the leader is handicapped by not being able to 'see' the twists and turns in the river very far ahead. The leader is forced to slow down or risk an unlucky turn bringing him face to face with an island, while the players in the back can plot efficient paths to steam ahead at a high rate of speed. This game is great fun to play and is one in which the theme is very well integrated with the mechanics. The only knock is that it can bunch up bad at the finish line if you play with the 'must finish at speed one' rule. That's unfortunate because the rule seems quite logical and is my preferred way to play.

I liked this game, but it felt long.  Our first time (including the Black Rose expansion) we broke the game.  A situation came up in the final two tiles wherin the Black Rose could indefinitely push the second place player away from the port; allowing the remaining players to go around and finish the route.

Fun racing game.  I think this would be considered a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; kind of game.  After a couple of playings, which I enjoyed and had fun with, the lack of depth becomes more and more obvious.  I haven&#039;t had the runaway leader problem some complain about, though.  Fun game.  I haven&#039;t played any other racing games, though, but I might be apt to suggest trying one of those out first.

RATING: 6.5

The Mississippi Queen is an older race game that probably shows its age in being relatively simplistic. Still, it's pretty interesting overall and is completely deterministic except in one crucial respect, and that's the neatest aspect of the game. The biggest differential factor between this and most other race games is that the topological course of the race is unknown at the start of the game and is only discovered as players progress through the course. The way that the next part of the map is discovered is that the first player to attempt to move off of the last revealed map tile in the course rolls a die, and then places a new tile in the direction indicated by the result. This is supposed to simulate the sometimes surprisingly winding Mississippi River [right around New Orleans, where I live, the river is famously bent such that you drive 100% due east from downtown to get to the part of town known as the "westbank"].

What the mechanism does is provide a very natural limiting factor against runaway leaders, a problem in race games if in any genre. You are free to take the lead any time you like, but that means you also must navigate the riskiest parts of the course, those unknown and unexpected turns. The game's movement mechanism is set up to model the slowness of river paddleboats, and it's entirely possible to run aground [and be eliminated from the game] if you head off the last known map tile in the course at too high a speed and get a bad die roll. This causes players in the lead to be a little more cautious about trying to extend that lead, which keeps everyone in the hunt. The players trailing behind get the benefit of knowing everything that's coming, and can take the turns at a higher speed so as to catch up. Despite this, there's still quite a significant runaway leader effect; a few lucky tile draws, and it's all over.

Racing game with paddleboats where you have to manage your coal and speed. Like other racing games, I'm no good at them, but what I don't like is that new boards appear when you leave one board, and if you happen to enter the wrong terrain or at the wrong speed, then it's curtains. Sure you could argue that one has to control their speed, but one can also argue they can see a few hexes ahead and not get a random terrain as they leave one.

I never would have thought this a Spiel des Jahres winner after playing it. It's not a bad game by any means, but the excitement level is pretty low (even with the ramming that goes on). This is little more than a simple mathematics exercise, and not a very challenging one at that. I'd like to try with the Black Rose add-on, but I never see this becoming a favorite - there are too many better race games.

Reminds me of Formula De. You need to control your speed and direction to get through the river, pick up passengers and be the first to the finish line. While the setup might be different each time, all you really need to do is find the shortest, straightest line through the river.

Enjoyable racing game where the racing itself is not random at all but the way river builds is. That creates an elegant hit-the-leader mechanic because the one going first will have hardest time to prepare what's coming. Game gets bonus points for having unusual theme.

RATING: 7.5
A little on the simplistic side, but the systems are pretty neat. A simple race game with very little luck--basically the only luck is the random river layout, which is cleverly used to slow down the leader. While it can take a few turns to get used to the movement, momentum, and coal systems, it's really intuitive once you have it down.

A nice racing game, with a nice catch the leader mechanism - the leader never knows if the next portion of track is going to veer left, right or centre, so they need to position themselves carefully or face being caught on the wrong side of the track. The requirement to slow down to a stop twice in the game to do first in, first served pick-ups creates for some mid-race competition. Lots to like for a family situation as it lasts just the right length of time (20-30 minutes) for what it is. The Black Rose expansion didn't do anything for me in terms of improving the game experience, slowing it down, so we've ignored it.

Traded on 1/13/09 with Starcraft for 3 other titles.

2014: I really tried hard to like the SDJ winner. It had great components, no doubt about that. Great box too. And theme.

As much as I tried to like it as a game, it just never did anything for me. With a very specific kind of gamer, I might have brought it out. But that gamer appeared SO rarely, and when they did appear, it just felt like there would be other games that are easier to teach, more fun, and less hassle.

Fairly entertaining race game. Antiquated components; the easily-bumped coal supply wheel obviously predates the invention of wooden cubes. Does it all come down to guessing which way the river will bend? Perhaps, so call it thematic.

RATING: 7
This has a fun racing game, complete with collisions and planning ahead for coal consumption, crash avoidance, and passenger pickup.  I like how the map is forever changing and variable.

The game should be played with the passenger rule, otherwise will be rather boring.  The game does have some monotony to it, even with the passengers.  I don't care for the high-speed movements into the finish line as well.

This game will always have a special place for me since I bought it right before my first date with my wife.

The randomized board where you "can't see around the bend", the speed and power controls, everything serves to reinforce the theme.

I play this one with the kids and/or as a let's kill some time until the gang's all here.  The mechanics are tactical (how do I get to speed one next to the passenger's dock), but the strategy is key (which passengers do I try to pick up).  Throw in some other interesting decisions like, "Is it worth burning a coal to bump my opponent off course?" and "Do I burn two coal to save a turn on this tile?" and you have a quick, fun little game.

RATING: 7
A very light, family-friendly game.  There is certainly a level of luck involved with the risks you take and how well they pan out for you, but in general people have a decent amount of control over the race.  It has been a lot of fun both times I've played, and it is just the right length for the filler-style game that it is.

Just darned cute. Fun and fast to play with the best little riverboats you could imagine. The basic game is too simple to rate a 7 but the standard game is a hoot.

A good race game, a fun light diversion. Like the creation of the map as you progress during the race. Must play with the passengers, and I would also require to be at 1 or 2 speed at the end instead of crashing into the dock at full speed.

Easy racing game that doesn't rely on dice rolling for its core mechanic... increase/decrease speed by one hex and change one hex facing every turn... spend coal for additional speed changes and direction changes... plays quickly and there's enough unpredictiblity to keep it fresh...

A fun game that doesn't last too long. Pretty lightweight. There's a nice catch-up mechanic based on the fact that the leader has the least information about the path of the river ahead, and so must travel more slowly and carefully to avoid trouble. The little plastic riverboats are cute, and nicely designed: the two "paddlewheels" that show a boat's speed and coal reserve are clever and effective.

If I gave fractional ratings more often, I'd give this a 6.5. But it hasn't enough depth to rate a 7.

Nice racing game with a little push your luck component (when you race at full speed on to a new river tile), which also works as a catch up mechanic. In the end this is a rather light game, but still some fun.

Nice concept of the board (the river) changing as the little steamboats chart their way down the river.  And the mechanism for determining speed and coal use by adjusting the wheel on the boat itself is cool.  And of course you get to pick up women! When my wargame buddies and I get together we occasionally take time out from the hardships of battle and overthinking (paralysis through analysis)and laugh our way through a quick play of Mississippi Queen . . with the Black Rose added. When playing with the family I tend to not bring in the Black Rose variant.

I see why this won SPJ in '97!  Nice touch in having a bit of game-play physics involved (having to slow down), and having to choose between resources needed to get ahead (and win) or being more careful and manoeuvring to pick up the "Belle" pieces.  Two small problems - one is that you can seemingly "crash" into the shore to stop yourself, and never damage your craft.  The other problem is that if you goof up early on, you're pretty much going to lose from the get-go.  I like the fact that the person in the lead has a reasonable chance of having to change directions because of the unknown way the tiles can be played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With too many people this game can really frustrate some players as they attempt to manuver around the crowded river and get shoved into awkward positions by the other jostling players. Games tend to be on the long side where players are ready for the game to end long before it does.

Very good racing game with an interesting theme. I really like the movement rules. The way the river is discovered is a clever way to prevent the leader from getting too far ahead. A couple house rules I use: Pushing a boat slows you down at the end of the turn like floating logs (from BR expansion). Arriving at a dock at any time with speed one (even on another player's turn) can pick up a passenger.

[b]Unique Component[/b] - River boats with little coal indicator paddle wheels for movement.  The river tiles to build the flowing river are very inventive too.


[b]Unique Mechanic[/b] -  Players never know where the river will flow.  In other words, you can't see around the bend to know what is coming next.  The tiles are laid randomly with only a single future river tile known and shown.  This makes for very interesting strategy in a racing game.


[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - This is a fun racing game.  It is unlike any other game.  The coal resource is used for everything but is extremely rare.  You need to use it, but at the same time you need to be tight with it.  You need to plan for things you cannot yet see.  And the other boats can push you around to places you might not want to be.  Great fun.



Good light filler.  A nice little race game.  Has some very interesting technique with the burning of coal and stopping to pick up the ladies.  I can not think of any other race game where you have to stop and pick some one/thing up.  The Black Rose Expansion is always played.

Got in 2005

Strategy - Try to save coal for the end.  Get belles as soon as possible then get a lead and try to stay in the lead.

My rating for MQ is down to 5 for now.  This has the potential to go down further, so I traded my copy away before I had to play again!  There are just too many other games out there that I enjoy far more than this one, mostly because there just really don't seem to be any realy meaningful decisions to make here. 
Now, to be fair, I'm not a big fan of racing games in general, so I may not be the target audience here, so take that into account when I give my ratings!

Another of those forgotten award-winners from the late 1990s, Mississippi Queen is a very fun little game.

It also is a nasty little racing game, though perhaps a bit deterministic.

I love the way the river is constructed--a very beautiful game.

Perhaps the expansion would make this more interesting.

One of the very first German games I purchased -- solely on the strength of the theme and game description.  I must admit, that I really like it.  The mechanic of the changing river is highly reflective of the actual situation on the Mighty Mississippi.

I really love the little steamboats.

Excellent race game with interesting choices to be made: using coal to speed the ship up means that boats might not be able to finish.

Love the expanding river board/tiles and the plastic steamships.

RATING: 6
An OK race game, but I much prefer the card-driven variety (Snow Tails, Fast Flowing Forest Fellers).

Here, like Kayak Chaos, you're racing down a variable track -- the lead player reveals the next tile (oriented L/C/R by die roll) when they move up far enough -- to reach the goal dock. But you have to pick up 2 (4er game) ladies en route. The first person to do so wins the game.

However, both picking up and docking must be done at speed 1. Boats start at speed 1 and can accelerate/decelerate by 1 each round for free; they can also make one 60 degree turn for free. Making bigger changes, or a sharper turn, requires spending one of your 6 coals. You must use full movement if possible (cannot hit land), or use up coal to slow down or turn if necessary. If you move into a hex with another boat, you displace it to an adjacent hex (but not the one you came from).

It's not a bad game, but I find it a bit tedious. It's also deterministic -- no randomness other than the course of the river, although there is some player chaos if someone displaces you (and I prefer a little randomness in games). And it's fiddly: the wheel indicators don't always work smoothly or stay where they're supposed to, and the passenger ladies don't stay on board either!

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Got to try a six player game of this at a game convention.  I do enjoy racing games in general and I think my rating of this reflects that.  It was just a good fun experience trying to navigate my boat down river faster than the other players.  The game has some luck for what the river shape will be and what obstacles will be where.  The players out front are subject to the luck more than the players in the back.  In addition there is a decent chaos factor as in a six player game there is no way to predict what the other players will do and how it will affect you.  Higher luck and chaos than I prefer, but it plays at a good pace and racing it just plain fun.  I would play it again if the opportunity arose.

RATING: 6
[Goldsieber 1997 edition] {Racing, Nautical; tile-lying, dice-rolling, variable-player-order} {5 basic game, 6.5 passenger variant} MQ is a thematic family racing game.  Its mechanics are unique: no cards and dice for a racing game.  You have to wisely control the direction, gear and coal to win.  There are plenty of player interactions if variant is used.  The only luck in the game is the determination of water flow when the leading player arrives at a new tile.  Thus, leading can be both advantageous and disadvantageous.  It is advantageous because no one will block you and you can plan more easily.  It's disadvantageous because the placement of a new tile may be very bad for you.  The passenger variant is much preferred to encourage better planning and fix other problems (like runaway leader).

The ships and passengers are attractive. The game is nicely made.

[Expansion] I hope that I can get the Black Rose expansion with a reasonable price. It is a good expansion because it provides new tactics for the basic game.

Another race game (not my favourite genre). Moves along quickly, tricky manouevouring to pick up Belles. Limited coal for the occasional awkward or emergency actions. Bumping has the advantage of adding interaction, although (as always) its better to give than to receive. I like the way the river's path slowly evolves.

I'm not a big fan of racing games, but this is a little bit more interesting than some of the other games I've played. The random tile placement keeps the game from being a boring "figure out the best move" type of game where it pays it take risks.

This is a nice racing game that gives the player a limited amount of coal to burn during the game.  The game gets hilarious as the steamboats come screeching to a halt to pick up Southern Belles, which usually causes some excellent collisions.  A valuable addition to the racing genre.

For some reason, I never had a chance to play this one until mid-2005, although as a former Spiel des Jahres winner it had long been my intention to learn it. To put it mildly, I was disappointed. The game as a whole is lackluster, but the randomness of the end game was simply silly, negating pretty much all the strategy and positioning that had come before ...

Only played once so far. I really enjoyed this racing game, but other players were less enthused. I think if this was played quickly, it would go over much better. I picked up the Black Rose expansion after the one playing, so hopefully that will help with the enjoyment. The game can be difficult for the mathematically-challenged who cannot think a few moves ahead very quickly.

The legendary status of Mississippi Queen seems to have less to do with its depth of gameplay (not much) and more to do with its too-short print run.  It's OK for a race game but the flavor is a decade old--and it was light family fare back then.  Formula D uses all the same mechanisms and more, to much greater effect.

A fantastic little racing game with great replayability (thanks to an ever-changing Mississippi), toy-like components, and tough decisions at every bend in the river. Put on some jazz, sip a bourbon and branch, and steer on down the Mississippi with this excellent and thematic game.

Fun racing game with great theme.

Components are very good overall, but I think the river tiles are particularly beautiful.

Many people feel that MQ does not play well without the Black Rose expansion.  The Black Rose expansion is excellent, but the game is still fun on it's own.  

I do love that the expansion allows for more players. 

You can play with only 2 without the expansion and you could use one of the other boats as the Black Rose if you have less than 5 players. Just print off the rules from the expansion to see how those things work.

All of this is to say that I am very happy to own MQ without the expansion it and does not need Black Rose to "fix" it.  

Update: I do enjoy the game even more with the expansion.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1.25

In this light, fun family game, players race their paddleboats down the Mississippi, picking up passengers along the way. But onboard coal supplies are limited, so each ship's acceleration and maneuvers must be carefully planned. Perhaps most interestingly, the twists and turns of the river are unknown at the start of the game, and are only revealed as ships progress downstream.

I love racing games. This one is a good introductory one, particularly it's not a card game. No difficuly rules, intuitive movement mechanism. Unforseen river directions give the game replay values and at a certain extent makes the leading boat suffering from slight uncertainty. Slow boats and new players still got a chance to catch-up and enjoy the tension.
The no-passenger rules is trivial but still good to to first time players to understand the movement mechanism easily. 
The passenger rules is always preferred and considered as the standard rules. The choice and competition of getting passengers adds some tactical decisions without making the game complex.
Deserve the winner of SdJ. Thumbs up for this one among racing games.

Very good quick race game.  I just played for the first time, and my first impression was that the race would be too static, but that was wrong.  I did not appreciate how much affect the tile placement has on turn order.  This lead to some very nice turn-arounds in our game.  I thought I had a good chance of winning, but a little bad luck and optimal plays by other players changed all that.  Fortunately, I like interesting surprises more than I like winning.

Great race game where the only random factor is the course of the river, you 'build' the river during the game.

The Black Queen expansion adds more strategic options, I would recommend it.

A fast, easy to learn racing game with a pretty original theme (seriously, how often do you see a racing game involving Mississippi river boats straight out of Mark Twain's era?), and with some impressive production quality too.  I'm really glad I bought a copy back when it was still in print.

The gameplay is simple enough (at least for veteran gamers) that you really need a full four or five players to keep things exciting game after game.  Even then, it can get a little repetitive if you don't also have the Black Rose expansion which complicates things up a little more by adding several new obstacles to worry about.

I've also found this one to be a nice family game that even my father (a definite non-gamer) can pick up, and that my younger relatives can learn very quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Somewhat easy racing game.  Limited resource (coal) which can not be replenished, so use it wisely as you manuever down river.  Docking at the end seems strange since it can get crowded - someone suggested just first one to the dock regardless of speed is one to play it.

Sold. First Play - 5 players - The group I had for the first play was not going to sit through a full game so I decided to go with the introductory game. I enjoyed it very much and I liked the interaction between the players with boats ramming into one another. The game was less than satisfying though because you never had to watch your speed. We all basically revved up to 6 speed and went for the goal. It did serve to familiarize myself with the game a little better so I'll be teaching a full game to other gamers tonight.

A game that grows on me with repeated play.  With skilled players every race is always a nail biter.  The passenger rules are mandatory (Don't play the basic game -- its a bore). Ditto the option for ending the race at full speed. (the game breaks when you need to slow to a stop).  This is one of those tough to solve puzzle games that gets unfairly classified as a light game though it's not.

Easy rules, lots of fun.

(Trade Interest: low) more strategy that at first it seems, since only one turn of the ship is allowed per player movement phase.  it can get quite tricky maneuvering through the islands.  we did end up with a difficult tile as the finishing tile, and were all jammed up trying to finish.  not sure if that is too great.  i would instead pre-select the final tile next game.

RATING: 6
An interesting racing game where you need to slow down to pick up passengers and end your movement at a full stop at the finish line.  This leads to some clever planning as you have limited coal to make more than basic maneuvers.  The game is a bit marred by the fog of war of how tiles are laid meaning you are taking a big chance being in the lead as you may need to make some sharp turns as the river reveals itself, but smart play seems to be able to mitigate that disadvantage somewhat.  A solid enough racing game, but I personally would always prefer to play Powerboats for this sort of thing.

As objective as I like to be, I think I may have a preconceived bias towards racing game.  Mississippi Queen is not bad per se.  In fact, I think the limited resource management; the passenger pick up requirement; the movement and turning mechanic are all quite clever.  However, I just can't seem to get excited by the whole package.  Probably play best with more people.

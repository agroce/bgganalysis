A clever and quite short hand-optimization game.  Where the original was more engine-building, this game is more about making the most out of your turn...solving a mini-puzzle.  Not a ton of planning and the game length is almost too short, but all in all, a really good package.

Very good game - it does an excellent job providing the feel of The Manhattan Project board game, but in a card game.  It plays quickly and smoothly, provides players with a variety of choices, and is easy to learn - especially if you have already played the board game.
I can see my rating going up after more plays and with more players.

Played a late stage prototype of the game at BGG.CON 2015.

Primary issue with the game is that there is to much randomness with the cards that come out (action cards and bomb cards) and there is too much "take that" in the game. Using the factory to force a player discard 60% of their hand (100% if two players do it) encourages play too much like Cosmic Encounters (which for me is rated as a 5) where a player will come into "Striking distance" of winning and then the other players gang up on them by forcing them down.  If two players collude, it effectively forces a player to skip his turn every round, until the "next" player comes within striking distance.  

If you are okay with a very light/short card game, high variability, and a "gang up on the leader" mechanic, then this game may work for you, but certainly is not my cup of tea.  

***There will obviously be balance changes/tweaks between this and when it released, but I don't see my rating significantly changing unless the core mechanics are changed***

Not sure how I feel at this point other than the rules were easy to digest and game offered some interesting choices.  I don't think I played optimally, which is good, because it means there is room for improvement.  Game feels more tactical than strategic with a good dose of luck mixed in.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: This game truly feels like The Manhattan Project condensed into a cardgame. Not only are the original theme and beautiful artwork present, many of the mechanisms are used as well. The cards can be used as workers, resources have to be gathered, and the objective is to be the first player to accumulate a certain number of bomb points. You can interact with other players via the double agent card but aside from that, interaction is limited to watching what the other players are stockpiling and anticipating which bombs they are trying to build. For now, my son and I are enamored with this quick-playing game and I expect us to get more plays in. I've also played the game solo and found it to be a bit of a brain-burner as you try to optimize the use of each card in the limited deck. This is a quickplaying filler with lots of meat on it's bones.

10 Plays: We're still enjoying this game and have found that the dynamics of the game really don't change much when we introduce a 3rd player to the game. More than anything, we're feeling that this is an optimization race with a tight finish. I'd like to try a 4player game to see what the interaction will be like.

I haven't played either of the big box Manhattan Project games so I can't compare it to those. However, as a simple card game, I love it. The multi use cards are very satisfying to create combo's with which is good because that's basically all you do in the game.

The solo variant doesn't work for me because of the card that lets you pick cards out of the discard pile. The problem is that later in the game when the discard pile is large, there are too many options. All of a sudden there is this information overload in a game that, in competitive play, has a concise and finite amount of decisions that can be made on a turn. I find I either play efficiently, which means spending what feels like half the game debating what cards to take from the discard pile, or play inefficiently to avoid the slog of looking through the discard pile constantly. Both are unsatisfying solo play experiences.

The Manhattan Project is in my opinion one of the best worker placement games of our age. The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction is a card driven adaptation of the original and does a fairly decent job of carrying that theme forwards. Overall I think this game has some issues, it can be heavily influenced by the luck of the draw. In our first play through we only played to the recommended 15 points, but I think this game would benefit from longer games to higher point values. This one will be getting another play but I'm not sure if it will stick around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What a great filler game! I love the multi-use cards, which really make this game feel more substantial than its tiny size suggests. Yes, it suffers from the same problem most card games do, in that some draws are better than others. But the game is so fast and short it doesn't bother me. If you play poorly, it's easy to play another quick round.

I do wish the game were slightly longer, but that's easily fixed by changing the end game trigger.  (P.S. I've found the game to be shorter than the play time suggests, especially with two players. We've knocked out games in 15-20 minutes with 2-p.).

My rating is based on a solo play of the game, and could go up ( I am hoping 7.5 or 8) based on how well I think it might go as a multiplayer game (3 or 4 players).  There isn't really any point to playing Chain Reaction as a solo game.  Nothing holds you back.  There is zero interaction with the game, and there is no real aim to the game.  I wanted so much more.  I will never play this solo again, but I am definitely going to try and get it played properly.  I liked how the cards will interact with each other, and that you can do whatever you want, based on your hand of cards.  There appears to be some take that cards, but they also have something that wholly benefits yourself and I am hoping this will be what motivates people more.

RATING: 8.9
Amazing solo experience. Pretty solitaire when playing with others with the exception of a few cards. I wish they had found a way to incorporate "the bombing your opponent method" to slow them down. (Maybe a future expansion) But a very satisfying experience none the less. Deluxe Version is definitely the way to go. The game is incredibly accessible while waiting for others t arrive for game night and can be completed with 2 in as little as 20 minutes. A real treat. Great job James!

great little game that lets me experience manhattan project over lunch hour.  The "chaining" of cards is great and easy to explain.  I picked up the deluxe edition so we get fun little tokens.  Need to sleeve as the cards are a bit lower quality considering how much they are handled in this game.

RATING: 3
Shockingly bad.  Great art design as usual for the series but for a series that has a wide decision space this offers the equivalent of GO FISH.  There are only a handful of different cards in the deck and you use one to play another, then wipe them all off the board.  Repeat it all over and over.  All you do is look at your 5 cards and find some way to play them.  Dosent matter much what you do.  Imagine a game where you have to jump left right and forward to win.  Now in this game you put your 5 cards together to do one of those 3 things, next round do a different one and then jump forward and your done.  Yeah you win.

This was a fun stocking stuffer game, good for a couple of plays (like getting a piece of chocolate in your stocking).

The idea of chaining cards together to get a nice production chain or combo is cool, but it very rarely happens.  I'll often end up with a pair of 2 card combos, and one useless card in hand.  When the stars align, though, you can (as the instructions point out) "almost" make a bomb in one turn.

The main problem is the randomness here, with zero ways to mitigate it (no ways to draw extra cards, apart from the factories which really just filter cards; no ways to gain ongoing powers).  You get what you get and you can't get upset.  Have a lot of yellow cake and need a card to convert them to uranium?  Too bad!  Have some more mines!  Need Scientists but get Engineers?  Too bad!  Maybe you could use the crappy Locations, but then don't expect anything interesting this turn.

Fun idea, but limited by randomness and by lack of variation in the cards (only 5? types, and some just better than others).

[5 Nov 2017] 7 (10 plays).

Preliminary rating after our first game. We pulled this out a few days after playing The Manhattan Project. Using the same theme, art and iconography was a huge win! We we're able to pick up the game and start playing with a minimal amount of friction.

The game plays in 15-20 minutes as players try to accumulate the materials to build atomic bombs. The game is quick moving with the longest part of each turn being trying to figure out the best chain. Everything can be played with a single deck of cards so it's highly portable.

There is a little bit of player interaction that can exist with the factory cards (force someone to discard), the espionage action and the double agent action. We didn't use those actions as much as we could of and the game felt very much like a solo experience because of that. In the next couple of plays, I'm going to try to use them more for attacking my opponents and see how that works out.

The common landmark cards also seemed useless. It's very expensive to use them and I didn't see a clutch situation where we would want to use them. Maybe more plays will reveal their power but for now they seem like a fool's move.

[27 Nov 2017] - 6.5 (10 plays)
Dropping the rating on this one after getting some more experience with multi-use card games. The chaining and the uses of the cards in MP: CR seem more obvious than something like Import/Export or Innovation. I was hoping for a heavier game and so I'm rating it more towards the midpoint of the bell curve. It's still a good game and one that I would still play. I would just look at my other options first.

[29 Dec 2017] - 6.5 (10 plays)
Sold this game as it didn't offer enough difference in game play to keep our attention past 10 plays. With so many other multi-use card games in our collection, we just stopped playing.

RATING: 6
Chain Reaction is a nice, light engine builder or introduction to engine building.  Make Resource A (Yellow cake); turn Resource A into Resource B (Uranium); Turn Resource B into bombs.  The bigger the bomb, the more victory points it is worth.

The game works off of some simple and fast, but clever chaining of cards where conservation of your cards from turn to turn is not necessary as you draw up to a full hand at the end of your turn.

The gameplay is intuitive and not too daunting, after a few turns everyone will click and then it's a race to warm up the cold war.

One issue I have with the game is the point values of some of the bombs.  The game has a 10 point end limit, some of the bombs are 6 and 7 points and while they do require more resources to build, if they can be built, then it's just a matter of building a low cost bomb for the quick win.  If someone can build a high point bomb there is little room for a comeback.  It is a matter of personal preference but ideally, at least in my mind the most expensive bomb would be 5 points, that way you either need to build 3-4 low point bombs or two of the high point bombs.

Even with that said I recommend giving this game a shot, it's a good game for a very low price.

Utilize the different aspects of your cards to build most valued collection of bombs as efficiently as possible by the end of the game. Consists mostly of stockpiling Yellow Cake and Uranium with the least amount of workers possible, until you can convert them into bombs with the right combination of workers.

If you like Manhattan Project, and you like card games, you probably will like this.

A very stripped down game where you are making a little engine work for that turn only.  Rinse and repeat for the following rounds.  Heavily dependent upon what cards you draw, but that's par for the course for short games like this.

I liked the artwork and the speed of the game.  While there aren't a lot of decisions, it was nice to play if you can't fit in a full game of Manhattan Project but still want to get the feel of it.

Quick, easy to pick up, and lots of fun. It's not overly complicated and the games are fairly short. I've only played with two players so far, and the games lasted about 20-25 minutes. The rule sheet could be organized a bit better, but it was sufficient enough for us to figure it out fairly quickly. I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a quick, small game that's easy to bring along with you.

Mildly interesting game with dual-use cards. Play cards to provide various types of workers to pay for other cards, which generate more workers, produce yellow cake or convert yellow cake to uranium. Then, spend uranium and more workers to construct bombs, which are worth victory points.

There is really just one strategic path and you simply do the best you can with your hand. Since you can play all your cards and refill your hand at the end of the turn, there is no room for actual hand management. There are also a few completely unnecessary special cards, including the boring and annoying "steal a card or resource from an opponent" just to force some player interaction. Luck of the draw cannot be mitigated and is very limiting. Sometimes it feels like your hand plays itself, but figuring out the optimal use for your cards is not totally devoid of fun. "Chain Reaction" is still better - and mercifully much faster - than its overrated and underdeveloped parent boardgame.

Great multipurpose cards.  Quick game play so it doesn't feel like it over stays its welcome.

Maybe I haven't played it enough or had good enough hands, but it kind of feels like there aren't a large amount of decisions to be made and all hands kind of lead to the same place so to speak.  

It's definitely something that will get busted out as a filler from time to time.  

Overall I like the original better because there are just more options and it feels like your plays have more potential.

The first time playing, it took me a bit to get the hang of it because it was new to me. But, as we played through several rounds, the play began to become easier. There is a bit of strategy involved, which is good, but it's not overly complex to confuse.

From a solo perspective only so far, Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction is on OK game. There is one particular set of card interactions that is pretty much required to get a good score. There are other decisions in the game that are not nearly as automatic and require thought. It is a fun game, but I have several others that I would prefer to play solo. I do like how incredibly small and portable MP: CR is. It will probably see some more play because of this and its small footprint while playing.

Is a fun, quick game with multiple options sabotage your opponents while building as many single turn engines to create bombs.  Easy to learn but after a few games in a row, it loses some of its spunk since there are really no ways to alter/expand the game play for more seasoned players.

There are very few decisions in this game. You draw 5 cards play them as best you can then draw 5 more and do it again. There is no sense of progression or clever play, just the luck of the draw.

KS: P & P version 

Really wanted the deluxe version but the shipping prices where so outrageous that it became the P&P version. 
I don't understand how some games on KS are approx 20 dollar shipping included. This was a card game and the total price would be 37 dollar. 

Edit: Bought it second hand. So now I own also a "real" copy

All in all, this was a fine game. I really like the multiple uses of each card and trying to plan the best options on your turn. It moved a little slow for my taste and I felt it had too high of a first player advantage, but overall it was still fun.

I liked the original MP game up to a point. The theme is a little bit disconcerting (I was kind of astonished when I heard there was a Japanese translation), and while it had some interesting ideas, it also had a lot of things that just didn't work very well (namely, the stuff such as bombing and spying that seeked to increase the interaction). It also had the misfortune of being introduced to me and my group during the height of worker placement mania, and couldn't really compete with other similar offerings. I had a hard time getting it played and eventually traded it away.

Since I'm also wary of the "microgame" fad, you'd think a microgame based on it wouldn't be of interest, but when the in-laws ask you to put things on your Amazon list for Christmas, you load it up with small inexpensive games. Hence, Chain Reaction.

We all learned it straight from the rules and were going pretty well after a couple of turns. The "chaining" is actually a pretty neat mechanism and is used in an interesting way. There's some much more straightforward interactions, and you can still choose between trying to build a bunch of small bombs or trying to get one big fat boy done. 

I don't think anyone was blown away by it (HA HA GET IT) but it wasn't a bad time.

RATING: 3
I can appreciate the effort to make an express version of a board game, but Chain Reaction falls flat.  As other users have posted below, this game is too luck based.  I spent several rounds doing nothing other than producing yellowcake because I wasn't getting the right cards to do more.  It was frustrating to say the least.  I'm out.

Prototype- I playtested this game several times at earlier stages. It was quick to learn, and fast paced. Nice little game for lighter players and captures the feel of the Manhattan project. Heavier players in my group complained because a lot depends on your draw each round.

This is a quick and overstreamlined Manhattan Project.

It's so quick that the simplification didn't bother me, but playing until 10 points is a bit too quick. We usually play to 15 points.

The chaining mechanisms grant some accomplishment feel, which is very good.

This is a simplified version of the Manhattan Project, and it works as a quick and light taste of it, you use multi-use cards as the workers/buildings. The rush to make the bombs is maybe a bit too quick, so you don't get the same proper build-up as with the boardgame. Ultimately I prefer the boardgame, but this works pretty well.

Quite uninteresting. Very simple and not much you can do. Lacks permanence and engine-building. (I know it's not an engine -building game but that's what I feel is lacking).

The game is too fast so luck in hands is really important.

The biggest issue I had is that all cards were very generic and not really anything standing out. Needs a bit more complexity.

When I first played this, I quite liked the combination of simply multi-use cards and worker placement. However, the luck in this is a bit too high and the game end can be anticlimactic. Also, as with it's big brother, the game is just a bit too randomly mean for my liking. Nice tiny package and really 'mobile' for on-the-go gaming. But not one I need to keep.

The game is a bit bland. Every turn takes about 20 seconds to figure out, and it ends up being pretty much the same thing over and over. The end conditions seem to be lacking as well. The game ends very abruptly because you generally can get the needed score in just two bomb build. One someone gets a large bomb done they immediately get such a large lead that it become rather difficult to catch up.

I still have to play the solo version though. Maybe it works better as a solo game.

[i]A quick filler that uses very basic multi use cards... I'm in. Unfortunately this ended up being much lighter than I expected. There just isn't enough variety in the cards/effects to warrant playing this more than a handful of times. I was really disappointed, but now I have more of an inclination to try the proper Manhattan Project worker placement game.[/i]

"Extremely small, very clever, quick game that is deeper than filler-weight. I don't love the theme, but the gameplay is compelling. As a 2p race, it is much better to go to 15 points, to smooth out the swinginess a bit. But it's fast enough (20 minutes) that I don't mind losing due to luck. It's easy to omit the couple attack cards, or just houserule that you can only use the gain effect, not the attack effect."

What I like:
- Dual-use cards are awesome
- Deckbuilder-style hand draws in a non-deckbuilder is clever
- Tiny box, quick gameplay (15-20 minutes with 2p)
- Only a few attack cards, and they can be omitted
- Great card quality, and nice graphic design (mostly)

What I don't like:
- Don't love the theme
- There should be an indicator of which bombs can/can't be loaded

My friend owns this, and I don't love the theme, but I'm still tempted to pick up a copy of this gem. It fits well in my current mode of buying games that come in small boxes but play like bigger games. I would put the weight around 2.3, which is above BGG voters. There are multiple strategies, and on many turns, figuring out the best way to combine your cards can be quite a puzzle.

- Simple to learn

[b]Cons[/b]
- After I sleeved they wouldn't fit back in the box and the cards definitely looked like they could use some sleeving.  They all have colors and such that go right up to the edge which means easier to tell what they are if they get marked up at all.

[b]Gamplay Thoughts[/b]
I really like how the cards can be used for multiple purposes and I have to choose which makes the most sense at the time and in future turns.  Sometimes there seems to be a lot of thinking and strategizing and other times I seem to only have one optimal path that is somewhat obvious. 

The only significant question mark I have at this point is solo scoring which is beat your previous scores.  Sometimes I'm not sure how effective my efforts are because the luck of the draw seems like it can have a significant affect on how well I do in a solo game. It seems like the randomness of the card draw might cause enough sway on my end score that I'm not sure if I can use the 'beat my own score' method and have it be accurate for how I actually did.  I'm sure this is common in other solo games but in this one it feels particularly relevant. Perhaps with more plays under my belt it might even out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Only played solo so far, but fairly disappointed in it. The decisions and 'chain reactions' are less interesting than I was hoping for. Basically just make sure you build yellow cake and/or uranium each turn, if possible (sometimes you don't get the cards), and build bombs as well when you can afford them. There are a few other kinds of cards in the game but not a whole lot, and mostly only let you draw cards or steal cards or tokens from the other player. It feels very shallow compared to the original. I wasn't expecting the whole game, but this seems too shallow even for a card game. Glory to Rome this is not.

This is a fantastic little card game! It has the depth of larger board game, but keeping the mechanics simple enough to teach relatively easily to pick up and get playing. Most turns, the game makes you feel like a genius coming up with useful card combinations. There is some randomness of course as cards are draw and you may not always get a hand of cards to  your benefit, but having two different uses for each card as well as some cards that allow you to steal or draw more cards help to curb that randomness. I would love to see expansions to perhaps provide more variety,  but this is a wonderful little gem that can be used either as a starter game or the main attraction in a game night.

Couldn't resist the theme on this one, seeing as Manhattan Project is one of my absolute favorite games. While I think this is a pretty good light-card-adaptation, I'm not sure I feel there's quite enough game here for my taste.

Good, filler card game version of Manhattan Project. Mostly a multiplayer solitaire race. When played quickly, a stressful brain-burner.

Cool core mechanics, but it's a solitaire game, that can be played against others for score.
Player interaction is almost nill.

Maintains the theme well. Not a replacement for Manhattan project by any means but a solid quick game that plays a lot like the original.

Has entertaining combos for a while, then you realize how little strategy the game has. The spy cards feel like they were thrown in because "card games just HAVE to be mean". I like mean card games (I play Innovation), but I like it much less when it's there in small quantities for no reason.

pretty awesome little card game.  I love that it does give me the feeling of Manhattan project, but it doesn't take up as big of a footprint, and I can play with more casual gamers.  it gives me the feeling of a worker placement in 20 minutes.  I am interested to try this with a higher player count and see how it changes.  I love also trying to use all your cards in your hand and find the most efficient way to score the most points.

Good filler game. A significant amount of luck is involved regarding what cards you draw so anybody can win which is nice for less intense game sessions.

This was far more cerebral than I was expecting and very puzzle like in terms of the variety of things you can do with your hand and deciding the best course of action. Unlike many card games luck has little factor. I have never played the original Manhattan Project but considering buying the base game after playing this. Had a blast (insert rimshot here)!

Light card game re-implementation of its namesake.  A race to get to 10 bomb points.  In alternating rounds, players draw and play up to five multipurpose cards to get yellow cake, employ scientists and workers, use central display landmark buildings, enrich uranium, build and load bombs.  Quick, straightforward play, light, not a lot of strategy or decision making.

Has the feel of Manhattan Project minus the warfare. Plays quick and fun with fun players, but can really drag with serious gamers when they figure out that it's advantageous to hold the Design Bomb cards until you're ready to actually build the bomb. Since there's only 2 Design Bomb cards in the entire deck, that turns a 5 player game into a lengthy ordeal. Have tried a couple house rules to get around that, such as "everybody gets a bomb with the design card" (like the board game) and "you must play Design Bomb immediately".

A good quick game before game night starts. Plays quickly, has some strategy, but won't cause AP. Needs more depth for me to want to pull this out more often.

This is quick and fun and easy to teach and learn. Some key mechanics are reminiscent of The Manhattan Project and the artwork is the same as this game we all know and love. But it doesn't replace the original IMO.

RATING: 7
Minimalistic components (good!), very short rules (good!), decent and fun gameplay makes this a winner. This might be a bit too simplistic for advanced players, but with the inherent cuteness factor, this is a good game for kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun game that is easy to set up and plays quickly.  There are a few instances where the game cannot be won as each play gives that same options as the prior play; but this is rare.

RATING: 5
Beautiful art, quick easy game.  Okay filler.  Likely more fun for younger folks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decent game, although the artwork is much better than actual gameplay. There's strategy, but... well... it's kind of boring and we only played a quick game. Also, figuring out the rhyming is a bit of a pain for some people. I think the lack of a real "take that" kind of attribute reduces the appeal a bit when it's so short.

I don't think this game has much replay value, but the art was appealing and the game played quickly and pleasantly. I still think stars are bad, but I lost so who knows.

Ok children's game. Nice combination between rhyming and symbols. The game as a whole reminds me of those logic puzzles where you press a button and then all adjacent buttons reverse.

Surprisingly fun and tactical for a short, light card game.  The art work is also beautiful.  We purchased this for our non gamer, art gifted daughter not expecting much for ourselves.  I'm glad to say everyone who played enjoyed it.

I've never been a huge fan of casual puzzle video games and that's what this game feels like. My youngest daughter likes it, but she also likes casual puzzle video games. I do like the artwork. And I will admit that it is portable and of good quality. The gameplay is just not for me.

(KIDS) A very simple kids game with nice artwork.  Seems best suited for little kids, but the littlest ones aren't going to be able to rhyme.  All in all, this seems okay.

Rating is only for two solo games that I have been played. You are supposed to keep track of the number of turns, but that is really hard to do. There are additional variants that have you adding cards or trying to get both sets of cards to be all fairies. I like it as a fun 10 minute brain teaser, but really I'm more excited to play this with my wife as I think she will love it and will likely cause the rating to rise.

Quick little game that is easy to teach.  Has quirky illustrations and clever titles.  You play a card, flip any cards that rhyme with it, and collect any cards with matching symbols as card just played.  Goal is to collect all fairies, or have at least 6(?) fairies.

its a cute little game. it was fun to play with my nephew but i was very disappointed with how big the box was compared to the contents. maybe add a small game board or something in there. its not that bad of a game but its for the younger crowd and i feel like something other than cards should have been included.

Not really for me. Has great art. You could theoretically permute through everyone's moves in an unfun way, but usually that only happens when someone has nearly won and everyone is trying to stop it.

Fun concept, my kids love the art, and have memorized all the character's names despite their varied literacy.

Adorable game, but super light.  It feels like a puzzle and some blocking of opponents is possible, but the game is usually over before I can really figure out what I'm doing.  My daughter is a fairy fan and really enjoys the game, so I enjoy playing it with her :)

The only time I played this was late at a con after a couple beers, so my evaluation may not be that reliable, but it seemed like a decent little filler game.

RATING: 5
Backed on Kickstarter for my kids who greatly enjoy it.  If I was smart, I would have had the cards laminated (they are too large for any sleeves I've ever found) as they are showing clear wear from grubby kid hands, but they enjoy it and can play it together, so a worthwhile purchase.  Game was delivered in a timely manner and the metal case is a nice addition.  The included sticker for "Big Big Belly" now adorns my laptop :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Backed this on Kickstarter. As everyone else has already said, the artwork is amazing and the rhymes are funny. But beyond that, it's a fun, quick game that encourages you to think. My kids love it - it's fun watching them try to figure out the cause and effects of each card they can play on their turn, and even giving out advice to other players. As an adult's game, I'd rate this a 7, but for a children's game it gets a 9.

Cute, simple, quick, and still requires a some brainpower to remember and sort out the dual layer game mechanic.  I might like this more than Love Letter :P

UPDATE: every once in awhile you can find yourself in a loop and one player has to make a suboptimal move in order to break the cycle.  Not the best designed game, but it's cute and simple.

Super-light game, but there is a modicum of strategy involved.  I'm always surprised when a game with a funny or clever name isn't bad, because so many of them are terrible.  But as long as you don't expect extreme depth, this one isn't half bad.

ok for young kids and has a side benefit of promoting reading and teaching simple strategies.  Also teaches rhyming.  As a game, however, it is very thin, and likely won;t last too long before they will want to move on.

A+ for the art though, which is great and alluring to young girls without being scary or adult-themed.

Deceptively easy to play, the continually flipping cards mean you need to remain alert.  It is a delighful, fun game, and needs to be played in that spirit.
2p can be hard due a limited card pool, but it seems a stalemate can be broken by offering a fairy to the line-up... as long as you're both not point-by-point competitive.

GDFR is a really light hand-management game wherein players must pay attention to the names of the cards and whether they rhyme with the names of other cards as well as the symbols shown on the cards. It has charming artwork and plays rather quickly. I worry a bit that the game could grind to a stalemate with no one being able to make progress on depleting her hand, but one play isn’t enough to evaluate how likely that is. This will be good to play with my kids and their friends once in a while.

Huge surprise of a game! Much more than I expected in terms of tactics! (However, not much more -- I expect game play will become repetitive and tedious after multiple plays. I agree with some of the comments here that gameplay can lead to stalemate.)

I also liked the idea of using rhyming words as a suit!

Not exactly sure how my niece and nephews will take to this game (they're around 6 years old). The tactics required to win this game are not that straightforward.

RATING: 6
pretty artwork, cute mechanic about rhyming, but stalemate prone in a big way.  If the game always terminated, it would be a nice little game.

With serious play, players can easily get stuck in infinite loops that nobody has an incentive to break.  With casual play without much forethought, the game keeps shifting but still drags on forever.  So, it ends up fitting with no crowd.

update:  if you impose a turn limit (say, 10 turns), the game is much better.  If nobody has won by the end, score #F - #G to see who won.

as is = 3/10
with turn limit = 6/10

The artwork and game play are both charming.  I have rated this so highly because this game encourages my developmentally disadvantaged nephew to read.  My nephew has difficulty reading and he's usually reluctant to try because his overall skill is so low.  He also has a speech impediment.    This weekend, we played Goblins Drool, Fairies Rule together and my nephew really enjoyed the experience.  Additionally, he put enthusiastic effort into reading the cards and rhyming them with others (as part of gameplay).  This was a rewarding experience for both of us!

Aimed toward a younger audience, but it does a very good job at what it does. A very interesting game that does away with numbers or dice. It's about rhyming and puzzle-solving. Very good to intellectually challenge children and relax for adults. It's like 10 minutes max, if a kid (or group) asks me to play with them, I will definitively smile and accept.

An interesting game with double sided cards which contain Goblins and Fairies. Matching rhyming cards causes them to be flipped while matching icons allows them to be taken. Don't be fooled by the childish premise, there is a fair amount of strategy involved. But I think that if/when a player can memorize the 20 cards, they would have a distinct advantage over a new player. A unique game with a blend of charm and grit.

Maybe I've just played too many games of GDFR to fill in hours waiting around airports, but I'm not a fan and there's many other games I'd choose before this ..

Odd and fairly amusing. Might be good for the odd game every now and then, as a quick filler.

Broken as a two-player game. A loop usually ends up happening where you keep playing and taking the same cards over and over again. I suspect this may be improved slightly with more players, but it's still just not a very fun game.

RATING: 5.5
Strictly for kids.  The theme is awesome, but the game too easily gets caught in these loops that take forever to get out of. There is just not quite enough here. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4.5

This was the door prize I picked out at BGG.CON 2013.  I lucked out on the solitaire play option; I didn't even check for that.

Wonderful art, silly quick game.  I like it.  Not sure if itll get play time with my mostly male group of gaming friends, but its a fun addition and well worth it for the awesome art.

Fun small game that is easy to break out with the kids and keeps the adults entertained. Semi complex puzzles can sneak up on you. There is also moments where it feels we are stuck in a loop.  Too bad it is only for 4 players when all the kids want to play. Might need to look for a variant for 6-8 players.

Great little game for younger and older kids. Basically, on your turn, you put a card in the pot, flip cards in the pot over based on rhyming card titles, and then take back cards that have a matching corner symbol of the card you placed in the pot. After a few rounds of this, the person who has exchanged all their goblin cards for fairies, or has gotten rid of all their goblin cards, wins. 

PROS: It's a very easy game to teach and play. The card art is cute and gross at the same time, and will appeal to girls and boys. Super easy to pack and take along on trips, since the entire game consists of 20 cards.

CONS: 2-player games have a tendency to get caught in an "exchange loop" stalemate, where no one can win without intentionally tipping things in favor of the other player. We've played once with 4 players, and it was pretty fun. Haven't played a 3-player game yet. Also, the cards are taller than standard card sizes, which makes them hard to shuffle, and no sleeves fit them. There's really no reason they couldn't have been standard sized.

I stumbled on this late in the kickstarter campaign... and with the kids getting interested in rhyming words (and always interested in fairies, goblins and other fantasy creatures) this was an easy family game to support!  

The art is of course fantastic and the large sized cards really show it off (and thankfully don't need to be put into little hands... just laid on the table!).  Watching young children puzzle through the names to decide which rhyme is pretty fun in and of itself and its very easy for them to match the symbols to decide who to take home... but planning ahead to know who will show which symbol will be showing when they are done rhyming will be a bit tougher to grasp.

I am concerned that you can play yourself into a corner or even be dealt a nearly impossible hand (say... all sun goblins with un-rhyme-y names) but I'll want to play some games with grown ups before I decide if that is a real issue.

If that turns out not to be a real issue I think this will be a nice light family game that we will get a lot of use out of.

A simple game with greater giggles, brought forth by words of jolly jingles, flipping and switching where they intermingle!

The game is good for little kids, as well as adults.  It's easy to learn, and not really a challenge for adults, but it's one that can be played with the entire family.  Two players plays well most of the time, but I noticed there are times where the game gets stuck in a repeating pattern of the cards cycling through the Fairy Ring until someone sacrifices a fairy.  Three players is much better, and usually avoids the issue of cards just cycling until someone makes a sacrifice.  We played the Print-N-Play version, and enjoyed it enough that I backed it on KickStarter.

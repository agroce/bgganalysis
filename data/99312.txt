My wife's favourite boardgame. She also has a 8-2 record against me, so this is obviously more than "roll some dice, somebody wins." I enjoy it a great deal as a two-player filler, and a multiplayer session of some challenge and considerable humour. And come on, Tom Wham. 
Edit: My son officially loves this. He is 5.

RATING: 7
A fairly decent game that plays pretty well and has some unique and fun mechanics that offer some refreshing play differences from similar games.

It has two major pluses over other resource management games:
 1) It has an army component (though for some this might actually be a minus).
 2) It seems to run a bit shorter than other more involved resource management games (which, IMO, is only good if you're in a bit of a time crunch).

Ultimately it's a bit dicey for my taste, and for what it is there are better games that I'd just rather play...but in a pinch or on occasion it could be just what the doctor asked for.

I really like the main mechanic of building on a grid, and then activating based on a cross-referenced die roll. The rest though, the attacking, the random events, the too complicated war stuff, made the game not very fun for me. If only there were a simpler game that used the first mechanic......:)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good fun. Don't take it too seriously. EDIT. Okay, I should probably add more than that.

A bit of a mish-mash of other games, but with its own personality that really comes out.

On a turn a player rolls dice, and everyone may get something based on the roll, somewhat like [i]Catan[/i]. You buy tiles to add to your fiefdom, which can come up in those dice rolls, and there's a good decision there whether to go for points or stuff.

Events are often [i]brutal[/i]. You'll hate the king by the end. The king may declare war, and you don't have enough armies to keep him happy, but you send what you have and lose a point. Then your troops die, and the other players' armies survive. It's not fair, but at least there are enough bad events that the unfairness is spread out, well, somewhat fairly. And to top it off, it has over-the-top events like "everyone loses a point" which do nothing except lengthen the game.

Look, it's okay to not like that. I get it. You want control.

But to me that's the beauty and joy of [i]Feudality[/i]. It's not the randomness that defines it, it's the sheer, utter variability. A dozen different play mats, wildly varied tiles to purchase (especially with the expansion), and crazy events that run the gamut from "everybody hurts" to "everybody benefits" and lots of sucker punches in between.

The games I hate the most are the ones that don't have a soul. Fortunately, that can't be said about [i]Feudality[/i].

Game is fun, but the random rolls can really help (or hurt) certain players.  In this game, the rest of the players need to put on their sabotage/attack hats when one player jumps out to a lead, even a small one.

Annoying twice-luck influenced (pull chits from bag, roll dice to generate resources) game about building up a kingdom.

Placing your VP generators on the main diagonal or near an 8 increased the likelihood of generating multiple scoring opportunities in a single turn.

For example: Spot 7,7 will see a reroll on 7 of its nine activation spaces: (6,6) (7,7) (8,8) (6,8) (7,8) (8,6) (8,7)

If you can get a VP generator there, you've probably locked up the game.

Other rules inadequacies didn't help, such as the confusion on whether you stacked army tokens of the same type (you do) and whether or not the entire stack (or just the top tile) counted for army maneuvers.

In the end, I played this the first time because I thought it was a new game by Tom Lehman - I blame the din of the convention on that one.

I played it a second time to introduce it to my wife because the artwork was cute.  She said about 2/3 of the way through that she'd rather stick forks in her eyes than buy this title.

Very random, very luck driven. That doesn't mean it isn't any fun, but it did detract a little for me because I felt like I had little control over the game. Granted, you do have to make decisions in tile placement and playing the odds and all, but sometimes simple turn order can screw you out of entire branches of technology.

Once you slog through the absolutely terribly organized rule book (it could have been half as many pages since it tells you the same rules 5 different times, and they chose a very odd order to present the information) there's a really fun game here!

Basically, players are building a fiefdom on an 8x8 grid, with dice rolled each turn to determine which space of the fiefdom is activated each turn.  If the two dice intersect on a space of your fiefdom on or next to a tile you've placed, that tile activates and you get resources (which are used to build more stuff) or points (which you need to win the game).

Then, an event card is flipped, and players must abide by the results.  Sometimes the king sends you to war, sometimes raiding parties show up, sometimes there are festivals where you get cool stuff, sometimes the queen has the hots for you, etc.  All kinds of wacky stuff that will affect the players in different ways.

In the next phase, players buy a tile from a tableau to put more cool stuff in their fiefdom.  Tiles that produce goods or points when activated, strengthen your army, or grant you other special abilities, like dice re-rolls.

The active player then gets a couple special actions, where he can make one of his tiles produce (without needing the luck of the dice that you normally need), or take other actions such as sex with the queen (you gain or lose points depending on your performance) or waging war against your opponents or other fictional countries (again gaining or losing points based on your performance).

Finally, you must feed your fiefdom or lose tiles from it.

These phases are repeated over and over until someone hits the prerequisite number of points.  The round is played out and most points wins.

Overall, this is a rather light strategy game with a heavy dose of luck, but for the game length (this can easily be whipped through in less than an hour) I felt the luck was very reasonable.  There are also a surprisingly high number of strategies to pursue, which I really wasn't expecting, and the game really allows you to choose a strategy and run with it.  Pretty good stuff!

This is a fun game. Plenty of random elements in this game with so many different tiles to try and build to get points while trying to defend your feifdom from not only random events decreed by the King but also other players. 1 Play.

Forget Catan, Small World, and other games of their ilk - this is THE kingdom building title for me. Another Tom Wham classic. A few slight flaws in the gameplay could do with houserules, primarily to do with the Sabotage action to affect another player, but... on the whole, a sadly underrated gem judging by many accounts. Lots of options by which to pursue victory points, which I like. Plus, most importantly of all, the game is bloody fun.

Also very happy the kingdom maps all feature different arrangements for hills/mountains/rivers.

Concept is a good one, but most of the actions just aren't that interesting, especially the baronial actions that are supposed to spark player interaction.  First play with 2p.  Maybe it needs more players to shine.  I might that.  Or I might just sell/trade it.  Tentative rating 6.

Enjoyable little game that takes dice rolling to the extreme. You have to be ok with lots of "If I roll higher, I win." The mechanics are fun with lots of event cards and competition for tiles. Well thought out game with cartoony graphics. I like it a a lot.

RATING: 4
Dice rolling for random effects based on tiles is something I'm not a fan of in dry euro games (i.e. Settlers). Also seems to have used the reverse turn order for two phase tile purchasing to even out first player advantage.

Race element seems rather determined by luck. Event cards add flavor to the game but also usually more excuses to roll dice to see if you win points.

I'm less forgiving of random adventure dice in a euro style or tile laying game than a thematic adventure game.

Silly fun art, cool components, small amount of strategic tile placement and tile purchasing with a small mitigation of luck. A little player interaction via tile market and attack tiles.

[2013-09-16 Rating: n.a. -> 5]
After my first play, I would have rated Feudality around 7. The building of your own fiefdom and hoping for the right dice combinations to show up was fun. Although the game ran a little too long for what it is, we did enjoy the this play and could also deal with the huge amount of luck that this game has. Sure, it would have been nicer if there would be an auction for the tiles so that it isn't pure luck who gets access to the best tiles each round, but it was okay and our opinion of Feudality was favorable.

It was the second play that left a sour taste. While we did ignore the baronial actions during our first play most of the time, they were used a lot more in the second play. And it was here where we got the feeling that they aren't really balanced, something that BGG user NateStraight also showed with his calculations in this [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/973454/some-calculations-relative-to-baron-actions]thread[/url]. The problem is that the [i]Secret Amorous Liaison[/i] action is far better than the other baronial action and if you do manage to get a wizard, you will most certainly get one victory point from the liaision each round. The problem is that the sabotage and war action are too weak to be a valid counterattack against this strategy and there's not much else you can do to stop a player whose luck with the queen holds out. The whole game comes down to using the Liaision and hoping for the best.

I would still play Feudality, just to see if there's something you can do to counter this strategy. But I wouldn't suggest Feudality and won't be too sad if I don't play it ever again.

Very reminiscent of Castles of Burgundy, and I really like the grid placement mechanic.  I still like Castles better, but this does have the advantage of playing up to 6 people rather than just 4. It's only glaring flaw is that, if you are playing with anyone who has more than a touch of AP, it's going to be a long session.

It's exactly what you would expect of a Tom Wham game: utterly random but with fun artwork and a certain amount of flavorful, zany charm. I was disappointed that the geography of the map and the token placement has almost no impact on the course of the game.

Although I wasn't impressed by Feudality, it was decent and I would play again if asked.

RATING: 4
A good little barony-building game, with a large dose of luck, a good deal of humour, but still with a feeling that you're building a style of fiefdom of your own choosing. Doesn't outstay its welcome, either.

Oct 2013: bumped down a bit, as I'm not convinced the  available actions were thought out very well; there are only 5 or 6, so you'd expect them to be well tested and balanced, and yet some of them are clearly pointless (very high risk, low potential reward) while one in particular is nearly always clearly the best one to do (low risk, good reward). The designer even stated as much on BGG!

Silly luck based settlers derivative.  The variable powers/resource tiles provide a lot of the flavor for the game.  Unlike settlers where your initial placement can make or break you, this game allows you to try to improve your situation through buying more resource producing tiles.  You also get actions which you can use to collect from any resource tile you want, to prevent you from being screwed by the dice.  

The dice rolls for resources (ala catan) work pretty well and clever tile placement can help alleviate the luck factor here.  The 50/50 chance of losing troops in battle interjects an obnoxious amount of luck into the game.  I won my first game of feudality by never losing a soldier, while the other players lost their soldiers 50% of the time.  Just luck but cheapened my win a bit.  

Overall I like the game, it has some neat mechanics and is a fun little chaotic resource manager / tile placement game.  The dice will turn off a lot of more classical eurosnoots but I think the settlers on steroids feel will really appeal to fans of lighter euros.

I prefer this to Settlers in some ways, as there is a lot of variety in where you place tokens that give you resources when you roll that tile. However, there is a little more involved in this game that might turn away players of Catan, and the artwork, while humorous, can sometimes be painfully simple, to the point where your art friends won't play with you because of it. If you've grown tired of Catan though, this is worth checking out for the event cards, the actions you can take as a player, and the fact that everyone gets their own land board to settle as they see fit.

I'm wondering why Lookout dropped its no-dice policy for Feudalherren. To me, it didn't stand out as a great dice game. It's old-fashioned in its use of dice. They can be brutal and kick you out of any contention for winning. They can be a cornucopia of VP's and push you to an uncontested victory which is what happened to me. A fun game with a huge potential to outstay its welcome. Definitely no game that warrants 90 minutes playing time.

Game is fast and fun.  New players are up to speed in just 10 mins of rules and after a couple of player turns.  Food and Gold should be a little more different color and a few more food cubes would be better as that is the only thing we have come close to running out of.

 All and all a game I would highly recomend to any players both beginners and long time gamers

I normally don't like games like this with a strong theme completed with many random factors, but somehow I wanted to play this one after reading the rules. After playing I can gladly state that this is a decent game Dice work nicely and despite them the production system is well balanced thanks to the baron actions. There also isn't anything game breaking included in the event cards which was my main concern before playing. And I like the take that actions which are highly risky so they aren't used ex tempore, but they are still viable options to beat the leader if need be. The art of the game is also really nice for the fact that this isn't any ultra light comedy splash. The only major con for me is the color closeness of food and gold.

I played a similar city town layout with dice city but feudality is much better. because it doesn't pretend to be a citybuilding game. Feudality is also way more suited for repeated plays.

I [i]should[/i] have loved this game, but I hate it.  [i]Maybe[/i] there are some decisions to be made, but after only a few plays I felt like I was playing every game on autopilot, and now when my kids clamor for this game, I slap them.  My keep always goes in the lower right corner, with my tower on 7/7; whenever it's my turn to buy a tile, there's either one obvious best choice, or they're all effectively the same; whenever I draw an event which hoses a player, it's just straight math to figure out who to hit.  I just don't have [i]fun[/i] playing this, which is surprising to me.  King of the Tabletop hasn't hit the table in years, but I remember having a lot more fun playing that.  (Maybe Feudaility would have been just as fun to me back then?  I don't know.)

Things I like:
- Tom Wham's art, because it's Tom Wham's art
- the token you pass around with the turn sequence to show whose turn it is
- some of the events are funny
- component quality is fine

But, bottom line, I feel like I have no meaningful decisions to make; everything is either obvious (where to put your tower & other tiles, what to buy) or random.  Just have no interest in playing again.

Found this one to be whimsical and fun with a dash of strategy.  Each person builds up their own fief purchasing different upgrades that allow production or purchase military, or upgrade their defenses.  Resource gathering is partially settler style but with 2d8 (and you can choose to use one building if it falls within the space rolled or is one of the 8 spaces adjacent).  Event cards add a dash of flavor, spice, and chaos to the game which one can seek to manage.  This game is a race to a certain number of points depending on the number of players.

At first this appears a random mess; actually quite a bit of it is still random. There is, however, some control when it comes to surviving the events but it seems somewhat separated from the rest of your game and your "strategy". It's certainly more of an old-school romp and that's what should be expected. Hell, GARY FREAKING GYGAX WAS A PLAYTESTER!

Someone in the forums mentioned statistical probability of the two dice and that there is a zone for best placement of new tiles. I cannot imagine finding a statistically probable zone given that you are not combining the values of the two dice rolled rather you are creating coordinates.

We all enjoyed our first experience and look to see if a second game makes this rise or fall in opinion.

Oh Tom Wham, many of your games are so delightful and silly. Great throwbacks to yesteryear that I still enjoy playing today. What happened here though? It's still got good humor that I really enjoy. Unfortunately playing this game is irritating at best. It employs a McMulti like resource collection system with a couple interesting differences. The King Cards can really screw you early and keep you down. I do like that you can't arbitrarily attack people who are at a lower score than you. The game is just a little too annoying though in the various ways you can get done over multiple times a turn.

Played this as a 2, 3 and 5 player game.  More players definitely makes it much, much better!!  An undiscovered gem as far as I am concerned.  So much fun, although I am sure there is a perfect strategy once you play it a few times.  We just enjoy it for what it is.

After 1st play, very positive.  A standard Tom Wham fun-fest that should not be taken too seriously!  Our learning 4p went for less than 2 hours and all had a good time.  Crazy, random some of the time, goofy events, etc.  If you want a math game go with a normal boring euro - this is not one of those.  Too much laughing to be a euro.  Don't get me wrong I like many euros, I just don't want people to get the impression that this is one.  Sure it has elements of them - resources and VPs.  The production system is a lot of fun as you get to place your bits where you want them.  Sure luck can go south, but so what?!

RATING: 2
Fun art and decent quality components but;
-Few meaningful decisions.
-Gets repetitive quick.
-Some actions like attacking other players don't make much sense.
-Parents should note that one action a player can take seems to strongly imply adultery (not, it seems to me, a good feature for a game rated for ages 10+ no matter how whimsically it is portrayed).

Some of this could probably be fixed with some well thought out houserules but, I'd still rather be playing something else.

Better than it sounded when reading the rules.  I should have known better seeing as how it is a Tom Wham game which is always a good sign.  Quite a random game but plenty of charm with the artwork and general silliness.  Scales very well, and adding players does not add excessive extra play time.  The game moves right along.

RATING: 7.5
Players build their fiefdom, spend resources and fight battles against other fiefdoms. What keeps it interesting is that your production is determined by chits you place on an 8x8 grid. Each turn two dice are rolled and the chits on each players board that correspond to that roll, or the 8 around it on the grid, produce. There's also an event card each round that brings taxes, knight tournaments etc.

It's not a perfect game but it's light, quick and just fun enough to warrant further plays. I love Wham's whimsical art.

This had all the makings of a really fun game, but similar to other Euros from Z-Man, this game really punishes its players for no discernible reason. Imagine playing Catan, but you absolutely need to benefit from the dice rolls, or else you'll fall considerably behind. This also reminded me of Lewis and Clark a bit, with how you can kind of hang back until you have the resources to spring forward. I was really hoping that this would dethrone Dice City for me, but Dice City is a far superior version of this idea.

Settlers-style dice roll optimization, i.e. you just try to place your tiles in such a way that you benefit from every possible roll. And then a touch of chaos added on top of that. There is not quite enough proper engine building on top of the tile placement puzzle, and the gameplay is quite repetitive.

Poorly chosen cube colors.

Honestly, a bit like Catan, minus the player interaction, or Dice City, minus the dice luck mitigation. A little bland. Not bad, but certainly not very engaging. There's not a lot to do with your resources. There really aren't any interesting decisions to be made. If you need resources, grab those. Roll for amorous encounter if you can. Repeat. The expansion didn't really add anything of value, just some tiles that honestly aren't that useful. I don't think I'll be playing this one again.

An interesting concept that generates an average game. You acquire tiles and place them on your 8x8 grid, with the tiles being the standard pay X resources to build, and which either generate resources or victory points when they're activated. Two d8 are rolled which will allow everyone one free activation of any tile that they have on that grid point, or adjacent to it. Hope it's a VP generator! You get to activate a resource generator or two for free each turn, or roll for VPs. And later in the game you may want to use your acquired army tiles to gain VPs - but each time you do, your army pieces must roll evens to survive. Which seems way too costly. Adding up all those rolls might indicate that there's just a smidge of randonmess underpinning this game, and I wouldn't be the one debating it. Add in an event card each turn which either penalises you or rewards you for having collecting this or that. The issue is that the theme (the well-trodden fiefdom building in medieval times, what a surprise) and the game length do not support this much randomness. Your main decisions are what tiles to acquire, where to place and what to generate. Your main strategy is to hope that the events and the die rolls reward those decisions.

Great Tom Wham game! Luck & Laughs, solid gameplay, very nice ideas & graphics. It's not really a strategy game, but it has all a good game needs: you buy things, you build things, you roll the dice, you whine about the bad events over which you have absolute no control, you build an army and go to war and sometimes you annoy your fellow gamers. 

CHANGE: After three plays, upgraded from "8" to "9". Addendum: I love this game. 

After several more games, I uprated it again from "9" to "10". WAY TO GO, TOM! A REALLY GREAT, GREAT GAME!

Don’t take this game seriously.  Random event cards will send bandits and dragons to pick apart your land.  Dice rolls determine resource additions and victory points.  Feels somewhat similar to Quarriors.  Fun, light game with cute artwork.  I really enjoy placing tiles on my fiefdom and rolling the dice with anticipation of what, if anything, I will achieve.

This feels too random.

There's certainly something very Catan-like about this game in that you are hoping for the dice to roll your way so that you get resources in return.  It's a neat little game but since dice plays such a big role, I find that the prevalent strategy is going to be to spread your tiles out and hope that every dice roll hits home for you somehow.  There's also a deck of event cards that add a bit more intrigue to the game but unfortunately also adds randomness to an already fairly random game.

The stuff that works in this game is fantastic, but I can't help but feel that this game was never fully developed.  I want to love it, but I feel that there are too many flaws to it.  That said, I like so much of it that I suspect that I'll spend some time to make living house rules for it.

I'm rather shocked at how much the game drags on. The pace really seems messed up.  It is a fun shopping building game with a light theme, yet you end up losing points over and over again and everyone just seems to be running on a tread mill.  

While the game works with 5 players, the length is exasperated. I might play this with four, and three might be great, but with 5 it is just WAY too long for what it is.  I can't imagine what 6 players is like.  

Don't get me started on why the wars don't work.  The Baronic actions need a complete rewrite.

Once the game gets going, everything is played in auto pilot mode.  Sure you get some choices during your turn, but only one is optimal.

The player board with the 8x8 grid and tile placement is great system, but their is not much behind it.

And I hate games where player affect the end game (à la Powergrid) even more so in this one where a specific number of VPs ends the game.

It's a fun game, that has some randomness to it.
Each player when they are the king rolls the dice to determine what resources or victory points other players will get on their boards. The player has to be smart about how they arrange the tiles on their feudality board so as to maximize the resources earned each turn. 
Tiles can also have victory points in addition to or in lieu of resources. A few lucky dice rolls can amass victory points for one person and nothing for the others a bit like bingo.  On a player's turn they can do baronial actions to guarantee the resources they want, attack other players, or seduce the queen. A player cannot however claim tiles with victory points on the baronial action.
Players have to also manage the army as to not get attacked especially when in the lead there are also random events each turn to keep the game a bit interesting.

Under-appreciated game.  Tile collecting, victory point game that uses a neat pawn placement mechanic that allows you to take victory points or resources each player turn.  You then use those resources to buy new tiles to play on your land (grid).  Each player turn also pulls an event that impacts everyone, some good, most bad.  So, each player turn, everyone is involved.  Picked up the expansion recently which included quit a few interesting tiles, including one that requires a "house rule".  Some may think that's lazy, but whatever.

The game does take a good hour, primarily because the beginning game is slow.  However, once you get 12+ tiles on your board, the victory points start to come fast and often.

I have taken a point off, however, for misspellings and, at times, confusing descriptions of a couple of the tiles.

Feudality is a tile laying adventure with Tom Wham charm. It features a novel pawn placement mechanic that allows you to score victory points or collect resources. In turn you can use resources to buy new tiles. On their turn each player draws a random event card that impacts everyone and usually it isn't good. This game is adorable and tragically overlooked.

RATING: 5
I like the way the map/grid works.  It makes any dice combination as likely to roll as any other (though I guess the doubles are slightly less likely to come up), so your tactic is to build up the locations of your tiles so that you can get something for whatever roll comes up.  It's still a little random, but it's a neat aspect of the game that I like quite a bit.

The rest of the game is too random for me, though.  Turn order during tile purchasing is too important, and while you can build stuff to anticipate the event cards (and get a full round to prepare for them), they can mess up whatever other plans you've made.  The battles are fine, but I don't like the live/die mechanism, since it makes it even more random.  And the Wizards with their interrupt actions?  Don't get me started on that.

That being said, I'd probably play this again.  It was still fun, despite the randomness, but it may have been that it was a good group for that sort of game.

I had hopes for light whimsy ([url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162]Awful Green Things[/url], anyone?), but instead I walked into a wall of knives.  So yes, Z-Man maintains its record as the most uneven game publisher in existence.

Not to harp, but a game advertised as a 6-player game should work reasonably well with that many players.  Here, since an event card is pulled each player turn, more players = more events before your next turn.  This kills the designer's promise of entertainment, since most events are black holes of disaster for the hapless players. Ugh.

Other problems:

There are tiles that (among other things) drop EVERYONE back VP, which only serves to lengthen the game.  This is never, ever a good idea.

The tiles are tiny, so players are forced to repeatedly stand up and squint to determine which tiles are available for purchase.  I didn't think to bring opera glasses to the table, but here it's worth a shot.

There are other problems, too, but I think I've said enough.  If you're going to try [i]Feudality[/i], limit yourself to no more than four players.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

Great game. Nothing new here, no original mechanisms, but very well executed. You build stuff on your own "fief" tile and each player's turn, it's dice-decided which area of everyone's fief is "activated". Everyone chooses one of their own tiles in that area, and gets that resource – or victory points. And then everyone gets to buy a new tile to add to their fief. Add to that a random event each turn, and play to a set amount of points.
Plays quick, and is really easy to grasp and great fun.

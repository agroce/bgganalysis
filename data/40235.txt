Much like Shear Panic, first play showed a game more complex and more clunky than the fun theme implies. This frustrated casual gamers. The auction mechanic (such as it is) is an odd affair with matching colored cubes. Nothing simple enough in this game to attract general game players. I'm not sure I'll be playing it again - there just isn't an audience in my gaming group for a game that appears cute, but decidedly is not.

Just bought. I have not known this game before but the theme attracts me so I took it before rush home.
The components are nice and the rules seem funny (just started reading).
Can't wait to play this!!!

After 2 plays, a good dynamic game but some rules may need clarification.

Entertaining little romp.  Good design, slightly complicated, but still intuitive.  The art and production quality is good, but the cards and boards are warping a little already.  I look forward to more plays of this.

Very good game with a good thematic approach even with an almost abstract bid mechanic. Very interesting combinations that you can do with the different roles that you bid for and the threads that you may get and will have to face.

RATING: 6
Provisional rating after one play. This game is nicely presented with attractive bits. Quick pick up and play rules with fast, fun game play. 

There is some bluffing involved and I liked the bidding mechanism. There is lots going on - turning cards, getting points, grabbing cubes, turning cards and buying bridge upgrades which gives the feeling of lots of interaction, but it is possibly a little fiddly, though this might come more easily with further plays. I'll definitely play again though wouldn't be surprised if it drops a notch after further plays.

RATING: 5
A solid auction game with a very silly theme.  I really appreciate the bidding mechanic in this as it prevents people from overbidding too much.  The card distribution is also fairly interesting as it always creates something to think about and calculate upon each turn.

After reading a few reviews, I didn't expect a 12 page rulebook with relatively small print; I thought there would be fewer rules.  Overall, though, the gameplay is pretty straightforward.  I quite enjoyed my first play of the game.

Five plays (3, 4 and 5 players).  I like it (4 and 5 players were better than 3).  It's in a tricky place as it isn't easy for newbies, but some gamers feel like there is too much out of their control.  I just can't seem to get this one to the table because of this fact.

Donated.

Different, and I mean that in a good way. We have played it twice in the family and had a good time. The problem with game is that it has a very narrow target audience. It is too light for my gamer friends, and too rules intensive for my non-gamer friends. That leaves my family, and we have many many games we want to play. So, I like it, butit will only be played in the family once in a while.

The components are not worth mentioning but the warped player boards.

The rules are an absolute mess. Many important things are not mentioned at all in the rules but only in the examples. Come on, that's a joke or what?

The game is quite simple but the way the rules are written it's impossible to play it correctly without heavy guesswork. We were 5 very experienced gamers all reading the rules and we didn't get it! So finally we just aborted the game. What a waste of time.

The game mechanic is purely abstract and the theme doesn't fit at all. No feeling of anything troll. On top the mechanic is boring and uninspired.

Z-Man is disappointing me again. Once a sure bet it's more of publishing everything that shows up now.

Takes a while to understand the rules. (Not that it's overly complicated, just that the rulebook is organized awkwardly.)

Once you get in the swing of things, it's got a quick pace, fun theme and interesting decisions.

We made some small two-sided "bins" for voting. Holding cubes in-hand for bidding made it easy to see if someone was bidding nothing... and also required a bit too much dexterity for kids to get some cubes into one and and the rest into another.

All in all, an enjoyable little game. If it was just a little shorter, I'd always want to play it twice in a row.

Blind bid auction game requiring players to acquire travellers with a balance between 2 characteristics. Characters also have some special actions.
The bridge upgrade is a bit misnamed since it doesn't actually make your bridge any better. It just accumulates a extra point on conversion. This seemed a bit too heavy handed for a such a minor effect.
I found this a bit random and tedious... the length is a bit long for something so light and the rules a bit too fiddly given the limited strategic/tactical scope.

Funky little game with some cute mechanisms and a terribly organized rule book.  It has a tendency to overstay its welcome, and there are some brutally harsh and unnecessarily obtuse tie-break rules (which come up often).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I thought this game was pretty good.  You blind bid for card selection.  Then try to get cards which match high food/money value.  They can be turned in for bridge upgrades.  The economic system is interesting in that when the money pool is gone, you get paid out of other players stash (the richest).  So don't get caught with too much money if the bank is broke!  Would like to play again, but doubt I will.

RATING: 5
Players are trolls, each maintaining and improving their own bridge that leads into a city.  Every turn, depending on the weather, several villagers are crossing these bridges as they go to and fro.  Us trolls bid rocks to claim travelers.   Travelers can either be eaten or ransomed, and you need to both to improve your bridge points.  Cute blind bidding auction game - felt a bit clunky as we were learning it, but it played much cleaner than it sounded.  Certainly willing to try it again - perhaps felt a bit long, but it was our first game.

There are some interesting mechanisms here, but overall the game takes too long for what it is. How's that for a cliche-filled statement?

JUL09 I rarely (OK, never) comment on a game after one play, but this game, although it appears to have some tactical element to the blind bidding and card selection is mostly a "luck fest" and damage limitation exercise.

removed the complicated, un-troll like, golden card rules of ransom. as if a troll would care about that. instead, the royal messenger now gives the ability to pass (one use only) and the princess is the fattest of all cards, so that the knight and dragon prefers to save/eat her rather than, as the original game, rescue an indifferent tavern keeper of surfnturf.

I simply do not understand the appeal of the game. The fantasy theme is never a positive thing for me. But this is supposed to be a light, fast fun game. I found none of those things to be true. It didn't drag out too long, but it could have been much shorter. But the main problem was that there was little fun to be had. Sure, there's a little take that, but for what appears to be a light romp there's an unexpectedly large number of rules. So more rules than expected + the theme + tedium ends up being problematic for me.

I just didn't find the game all that enjoyable.  This is one of those type of games that I feel needs to be played quickly but there are times where this game gets slowed down as people have to think/remember what other people may have available to bid.  Blind bidding doesn't help - it remains one of my least favorite mechanisms although it has its place I suppose.

A bidding filler that outstays its welcome. Bidding is just arbitrary and it really doesn't matter what place you win by the bid. Silly mechanisms to balance score and too random to really be fun. Our newer player was lost, so it's not very new-player friendly and doesn't have enough substance to keep gamers interested. Just an uninteresting game to me. A much better filler, that feels similar in its "choose from a set of cards", is Guillotine.

I was really hoping this would be a good game.  It was designed by a local guy and so I wanted to buy it to support him and his efforts.  When my FLGS wasn't opening a copy for game night I almost bought it, but I held out.  Finally they did open a copy so I got a chance to play it and I wasn't too impressed.

In bridge troll you are a troll that lives underneath a bridge.  The current player rolls a weather die which displays rainy, cloudy, partly cloudy, or sunny (this is a six sided die and I'm not sure what has the extra two sides, probably cloudy and partly cloudy).  This determines, along with the number of players, how many people are passing by.  One of them is placed face down, the rest are placed face up.  At this point each player decides how many boulders (of the same color) to use in order to get these travelers.  A lot of the travelers are helpful, while others you have to fend off, including some billy goats.  If you bid 0, your bridge is closed for that round.  If you have your bridge open, starting with the highest bidder, players choose which traveler they want to take, this goes around until all, yes even the bad, travelers have been taken.  Most travelers have food points and money points, you have to decide whether to use them as food or money at this point.  

After all the travelers are chosen you get some boulders back.  People with closed bridges get a boulder for every open bridge from the general supply.  People with open bridges starting with the lowest bidder get to take the bid of any player, including themselves.  Now everybody has the opportunity to improve their bridge, or get victory points towards winning.  This is done by using cards from the tolls and the food to get points.

I'm not entirely sure what I didn't like about this game.  Maybe I was having bad luck, but there really wasn't too much strategy involved.  We even had people leave in the middle with people to replace them because they weren't enjoying it.

I gave this a 5 because I really do need to try it again.  It wasn't good enough to add to my collection, but I'm guessing if/when I try it again the rating will drop.  There is too much luck involved for my liking.

So many rules in what appears to be a kid's game! Bridge Troll would be a simple bidding game except that players start with their own currency that all has the same value, yet can never be combined. Why? What is the thematic explanation behind that?

On the topic of theme, let's examine Troll society divined from this game's play mechanics:
-Trolls use boulders as currency. These boulders will not mix, but are of equal value.
-Trolls organize a queue of Villagers who become mysteriously compelled to cross troll bridges, the order of the queue decided by bid.
-Rank in troll society is decided by who has the prettiest bridge.
-Troll bridges are apparently constructed of gold coins received as ransom for valuable villagers and a mortar made of valueless villagers reduced to a paste.

I can play and enjoy pure abstract games, but games that try to have a theme where the mechanics don't support said theme really irritate me.

One of my favorite games! I've played a large variety of games out there, from collectible card games to Monopoly to more Euro-style games such as Agricola and Settlers of Catan, and this one is on my top five favorites. I love the artwork, the clever, fun and cute mechanics, and the wonderful lore that Alf Seegert has done well to weave through out it all. I recommend this game to anyone who has a good sense of humor or who wants one, and who enjoys playing something a little off the beaten path. Top notch I say!

Quite disappointing. Looks good and the game should be faster flowing than it was in our first play of it. But there really didn't seem enough to make me want ot play it again in a hurry. Numerous fiddly microphases to the turn and not really enjoyed by anyone in our 6p game because of it.

For a blind bidding over-and-over game, credit must be given for managing to keep my interest for its duration. It gives enough information so you can generally predict what people will bid, but still allow for surprise, so it's less random that its genre generally provides. The charm is provided by providing differently coloured cubes to bid with, in effect different currencies, which move around between the players. You can only bid with one currency, so there are some tactics involved in what you collect. The cards being bid for are revealed each round (and one's face down as a nice twist) range between gold and food (which must be matched off to earn VPs), to special power cards (which provide a nice but non-game-overwhelming choice) and the occasional disaster cards which affect you if you're forced to pick them up (eg lose your gathered gold cards that you haven't netted off with food cards for VPs yet). Keep doing new rounds of putting out cards, bidding, and collecting cards until the deck runs out. Most VPs wins. There's not a lot of tension, but it moves along nicely. Mostly harmless.

Needs to go back in the oven for 30 more minutes.  There's a game worth playing inside the core mechanics, but as implemented it's kind of a strange mix of arbitrary results.  Good play is often punished, bad play leaves you sitting idle.  Threading the needle between the two is a pretty difficult task.

[b]I'm not sure, but I think key to winning this game is to be the most mediocre player, maybe a shade below.  This may be the perfect game for someone with an IQ of 90.[/b]

This is a clever little game. A bit overcomplicated for what it offers but once you've played it a couple of times, it comes clear. To clarify, I mean mechanically overcomplicated for what it is (it's not as complicated a ga,e as, say, Brass). It's cute and fun, though.

Kinda goofy, especially the "drunk portraiture" art. Spending boulders to even out your points doesn't seem terribly worth it. Similarly, in our only play, the knights/bandits/dragons had more or less no effect. We could have been (un)lucky but it seemed like half the game was missing.

I like the theme.  The story of what you are doing as a player works for me.  My big issue was that the blind bidding can be frustrating.  There is a real disincentive to having the most cubes (both between being stolen from and from losing ties). Trying to get into a particular turn order is really important for drafting cards.  It is easy to tie if you make fair bids and if you have the most cubes then you lose ties.   If you intentionally over-bid then you choose cube lots last and other players can control your position to constantly be stuck with the most cubes.  It seems that the best way out of the cycle is to pass and blow your cubes out through the VP compensation to even your food/money, but then you might have just gotten lucky with a card draw and been more efficient by bidding low.  Hrmph.

There are too many special cards that are entirely circumstantial, and then other cards that just give you VPs.  What?  It takes so much effort to get VPs, and then some cards just give you +3.

I want to like it more than I do.

Bought on a feeling that it would make a nice family game.  Art and theme is good.  Colors are excellent.  After 1 play, I'm not exactly thrilled.  Seems much longer than it should be.  Didn't feel like I had much control.  Any interesting interactions were too random to be able to "pull off" when desired in any meaningful way.

Feels like Pick Picknic, but unfortunately not quite as good.  Sometimes simpler is better?

A somewhat chaotic game of blind bidding and set-collection. After becoming familiar with the hazards, the game should move along pretty quickly. I don't generally like blind bidding, but it works reasonably well here. I also like the Money-style redistribution of auction bids each turn. I suspect, though, that it will end up being too chaotic for me (since I can't predict who's going to bid or drop out, so it'll be almost completely random as to who gets the hazard cards!).

--- Summary ---
Players start with 6 cubes (boulders) in their color. Each round, Start Player rolls a weather d6 and flip appropriate number (look on chart for number of players in game) of travelers (one face down, the rest face up). Players then blind bid using boulders of a single color. If bid 0, they're out this round. Others get priority cards in order of their bid. In order, they choose traveler cards until all have been chosen. Travelers are usually good (worth some amount of money and/or food), but there are also hazards as well (e.g., discard your most valuable card, spend a combination of boulders to earn VP, etc.). When taking a card, place them in either your food or money pile (sides of your bridge card).

Then, Klunker or Money style, in reverse priority order, you may take any player's boulders bid. Players who passed this round get 1 cube/boulder from supply per player who did bid.

Finally, players may turn in food/money cards (with matching sums of values) and convert to VP chits (the lower of the sums). They can also convert VP chits into VP cards, which are safe from hazards and worth a bonus VP per card.

The game ends after going through the deck of traveler cards. The player with the most VPs wins.

A nice game with very thematic art. The game is easy enough to understand and to play, not taking long (normally less than 1 hour).

It's more tatical than strategical, probably because Trolls can't think too much ahead. The players must do some seriously thinking before bid and sometimes wich card to choose (but usually is fairly easy to know what to get).

There are a some amount of interaction between players (in the cubes/boulders department) and in the bid (not only in the amount but also in wich cards to take and wich leave to the others), but not much more, tough you feel like there are much more interactions!

Approved!

Biggest drawback of this game, is that it has more (unintuitive) rules than the great artwork and components suggest. In my experience, that makes it easy to get to the table in a family setting, but less likely to be requested after an initial play. It is not that gameplay is bad, but after a longer-than-expected explanation of the rules, the game also runs longer than expected. On top of that, the game does not offer enough strategy for its playing time (it pretty chaotic having blind bidding as its main game mechanic). Bit of a disappointment I'm afraid.

RATING: 5
excellent theme (well integrated and graphically well presented), and the mechanics are all sound separately,  but together they generate a high amount of parity (via the heavy negative feedback loop of resources),  which is broken primarily by the way the cards come out.  the distribution of the boulders means your bid capabilities wax and wane... so you're hoping the right set of cards comes out when your boulders are waxing.  

not a luck "fest",  but certainly not prone to much strategizing.  I would play again, but wouldn't suggest it often.

the rules are a bit "swirly" to explain, so i recommend going over them quickly, and then just handhold people through a turn or so.  people will pick it up after the second turn, in general.

RATING: 7
I like this game.  It's a lightweight blind-bidding game in which you get to grunt like a troll, eat/extort passing travelers, and do battle with the better known Billy Goats Gruff.  Seriously, who doesn't like to grunt like an evil, hungry troll?  On the downside, I think that boulder-diversity is undervalued as it seems to matter only when battling the three billy goats.   Also, I wish the bridge upgrade cards served more than a simple bookkeeping purpose.  Rather than giving you a single bonus point, I'd like to see them give the player who purchases them a more interesting in-game benefit.  Still, a solid effort from both a really nice designer (Alf) and artist (Ryan).

I would say that "slightly boring" is a good way to describe this game. Which is odd because it seems good and really doesn't have that much working against it. I guess it is too simple- there is not much to it. I was very "underwhelmed" as my BF put it. I wouldn't say that it's a bad game, it's not one of my least favorites, but it's certainly not good- it's just meh.

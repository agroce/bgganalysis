Excitant jeux de plateau ou l'objectif est de deployer ses cartes parmis les differentes zones d'un chateau ou chaque carte a son propre role.

Le premier joueur qui a termine de deployer ses cartes, gagne.

La prise de controle des cartes est dotÃ© d'une mecanique interessante ou les joueurs applique un jeton de bois de sa couleur pour indiquer que la carte lui appartient.  L'echange de proprietaire, les relations de forces entre les cartes et leur retour dans les mains des joueurs en font un jeu ou les revirrement est de mise.

La strategie joue un role critique dans les parties a deux ou trois joueurs.   De quatre a cinq, quoi qu'amusant, le hazard des cartes en mains prend le dessus.

Un classique pour ma conjointe et moi-meme!
Le seul defaut c'est le plateau de jeux qui a tendance a se deplacer en jeux.  
Je vais trouver un moyen d'en fabriquer un plus rigide qui incluerait la court interieure du chateau.  Mais comment mettre ca dans la boite??   Mmmm.

Se joue en 60-90 minutes

RATING: 7.5
Interesting little game that plays fairly quickly. The variety of the cards gives you many options in the game but you can break these options down into catagories and this helps you in choosing a strategy. Plenty of options for devious/thoughtful play if you understand what each of the cards can do for you. Probably better as a two player game than with more where it devolves into a Take That type game with little control.

RATING: 6
Somewhat entertaining. I think all the players really need to know all the cards for this to be a really good game, though. May have more promise and I'd like to give it some more plays.

I tried it with 4 players and it was quite chaotic. The rules are simple, quick setup and the artwork is nice but there is a lot of text on some cards, something that naturally increased the playing time and made the game to overstay its welcome. Very tactical game and prone to Analysis Paralysis. There is also a lot of kingmaking. 
I suspect that the game will be better with 2 or 3 players.

RATING: 5
As a quick game, this one can be okay, but it can only aspire to filler status and it tends to take too long for what it is.  Yes you can play it very quickly, but speed of play is less the issue than number of turns.  There are bound to be a few turns which just feel like going through the motions.  Almost as if the game isn't quite tight - but then you realize it really can't be compressed and still work - which is why it lands in the middle of the pack for rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This seems to get better once all players have played a few times and understand the interactions between the cards. A few glitches with some of the mechanics that seem like they could have been smoothed out with more playtesting, but overall quite fun with a crowd that would steer clear of Puerto Rico. So far 3 player seems best, with 4 a close second.

This game takes couple times to sink in, and it's not fair if everyone don't know the cards that well. Neverthless, I like this for the fact that the amount of players change the game so much - with 2 persons this is quite tactical, with 3 or more it gets chaotic and fun.

Castle is an extremely fun card laying screw your opponent sort of game. I think this will end up being best with 2 players. My 1 game was with 2 and I was able to just eke out a win at the very end. Will update this with another play with 3 or 4.

A decent, very light and rather chaotic card game, although the nature changes in two-player mode to something more controlled and tactical.  An interesting game, nice cards, and I even did up cards for the expansion... but all in all, while a good game, not one that's a keeper for me.

This is a card/tile laying game except every card you place has a role/special power.  The goal of the game is to get rid of your deck of cards first, so you'll be jockeying to place your characters while returning opponents back to their hand.  Plays very strategically with 2 and gets more crazy/chaotic when you add more players.  Quick, light and very enjoyable.

A very enjoyable game.  Quick and easy to set up and play Castle is a regular on  my gaming table.  It is lots of fun!

I just don't 'get' trhe criticisms levelled at this game.  I've played it maybe 30-40 times and everyone I've played with has had a laugh and really enjoyed it.  If this had been released by FFG as one of their Silver Line games I am sure it would get more positive comments.

Yes, there is randomness, yes there is take that, yes there is a lot of swapping and changing.  The game is about keeping your head above the water and doing the best with what you have.  It is als a highly thematic little card game, that manages to neatly combine good humour with neat card play.  A wonderful game and one of my all-time favourites.

The best thing about this game is how it plays SO differently with different numbers of players. It's a bit dry with 2, but very strategic, and with 4 or 5 it's seemingly random. A very good game with 3, and the art is great.

I can't describe how much I disliked this game.  My poor wife did the best she could but eventually broke down and muttered something  to the effect of I will never play this game again.  My biggest problem is that EVERY card causes something and most of what is causes is stupid.  You kill off people only to have them go back to your opponent who simply puts them back in play.

A slow starter with a moderately chaotic middle.  The game improves as you learn the cards and thus can somewhat predict responses.  seems like it would be best with 3 or four.  The end game tends to the annoying with a round of stop-the-leader until the "mean cards" have been exhausted and someone sneaks through for the win.

I have only played with two, but found the game to be enjoyable.  Getting to know the cards is very important... and there is certainly some luck here, but it's a fun two player game nonetheless.  I don't think it ranks in my top-tier, though, but future games might change my mind.

Cute design. Nice idea with playing people inside and outside a castle. soldiers on the walls, catapults outside the walls etc. There were too many roles for me to fully grok on my only play, but they seemed mostly interesting or cute. I don't think my rating would go up even with a full grasp of all the cards (of which there are many), because it falls into the category of games where near the end everyone does (or should) play to stop the leader. I.e., you don't do much to ensure the win for yourself, but rather you win by getting attacked the least in the final round, particularly by the player before not happening to have a card that can hurt you. Generally speaking of course.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Por lo que dice el autor, nació casi a la vez que el Ciudadelas (yo hago acto de fe). Es un juego que tira a lo coleccionable cuya versión final del juego tal vez podría haber sido mejor.

A pesar tirar a lo coleccionable, teóricamente se podría hacer un juego para el PC con una inteligencia artificial (IA) que casi fuera imposible ganarla (juego sin suerte) gracias a las casi infinitas combinaciones (debidas a los diferentes personajes) las cuales a un hombre les es muy difícil calcularlas.

Se puede decir que es un juego de cartas cuyo resultado final tal vez podría haber sido mejor (solo tal vez) pero posiblemente sea uno de los mejores juegos de cartas semicoleccionables.

Las cartas tienen mucho texto así que no lo compréis en alemán.[/COLOR]

Loads of unique, seemingly interactive cards combined with the different sections of the castle might lead you to believe that this is a highly interactive game of setting up an executing exciting combos. It's not. Most interactions are rather meaningless for the overall gamestate. Castel fails to deliver meaningful decisions and is consequently neither engaging nor fun.

Bought it for probably about $16.  I love games by both Serge Laget (Shadows Over Camelot) and Bruno Faidutti (Citadels), where there are player-specific powers, and beautiful artwork.  They also designed Mystery of the Abbey together.

Card laying game where players are trying to empty their hands of cards.  Cards have rules as to where they can be placed in castles, and too many of them have &quot;whack me&quot; potential.  What is left is a thump the leader game until someone slips through and wins.   As with a lot of Faidutti&#039;s games, chaos reigns, but it doesn&#039;t work too well here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The mechanic is clever, and reminds me of Magic the Gathering a bit in its concepts (bounce effects, analyzing card advantage, noticing combos).  Also, the card effects are often tied to the theme in a clever or funny way.  But the main problem I noticed was that many times, you could not find a beneficial way to use the card effect, so you spend a lot of time reading different card effects only to play them with no effect.  This leaves the game feeling a bit boring at times.  This is based only on playing with 2 players, it may play a bit better with more players.

Castle seems to be a little chaotic. If you know the cards well, it helps. Rather light. Not a lot of control on what ever happens during the game. Some cards are more powerful than others.

Not a huge card gamer. There are some exceptions. Castle isn't one of them.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

I don't plan to play Castle any time soon.

Good game if you're into CCG's, where every card has its own rule-breaking mechanic. For us, we thought it was too much "look at your cards, try to figure out how they work together." Can't imagine playing this with four or five. Bruno had a variant using two sets on his website that looks interesting, but ultimately not for us.

SOLD IT!

For the price, a nice little game. A bit messy of a play area, and the need to waste actions drawing your deck seems like busy work (there is really no differance if all players had their deck in hand at begining of game. It can get tedious. There are much better mini games out there, still it's worth playing at least once... there are some new concepts here.

Pretty CCG style cards with unique abilities and a medieval theme.  Two-player games are longer and more strategic, whereas multi-player games are quicker and the outcome is less dependent on your choices.  Can be slightly chaotic.  

Play with variants: 
1. Starting player only gets one action in first turn (reason: mitigate advantage of starting first, which enables player to get headstart playing cards or getting power cards from Exchange); 
2. Maximum hand limit of starting hand plus two (reason: otherwise the optimal strategy is to draw all cards to hand.); 
3. Optional: After playing Fool and Village Idiot, the turn order changes (reason: takes away from advantage of starting first, and adds an interesting and surprising twist to the game).

Very language dependent. I enjoyed this game. I tend to dislike these games with rules on every card, but Castle really worked and the card actions are very well balanced. We started off doing obvious things but developed better stratageies as the game went on. I just won, but it got close. We played as a 3 player game and I recommend it for this. *** Played as a 4 player game and I am less enamoured now. Nice but nothing dramatic after all.

RATING: 7.6
I've only played it with two and three.  It's quite tactical and a lot of FUN!  I feel like it combines the best elements of "Kingdoms" and "Guillotine".  It is a tile-laying race with massive screwage.  The great (sometimes sexy!) artwork and thematic tile powers boost it to a 7.6 for me.  The only reason it doesn't break the "8 barrier" is that the two-player game result can sometimes be lopsided and predictable if one of the players gets a large majority of the "send back" cards.

I highly recommend playing with the variant rule that allows you to draw only ONE card per turn.

Played 1 time. Well, I finally got to try this game after having waited 3 years wondering what it was like. I played with 3 players and it kinda fell flat for me. I really like action card games, but I felt like either their isn&#039;t much control over what all happens and that the cards don&#039;t interact with enough other cards, or I don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; the game yet. I think I don&#039;t quite get it yet, but even while I was playing, it just seemed less &quot;actiony&quot; that I was hoping. A lot of the cards have almost no effect on lots of other cards. Won&#039;t go down, but may not go up either.

Az alulpontozása ellenére nem egy rossz játék. Tipikus party jellegű darab, engem leginkább a masquesra emlékeztetett. Kártyákat pakolunk felváltva, különböző helyekre annak a reményében, hogy mi leszünk az elsők, akiknek el fogy a paklija. Erőteljes kitolási faktor, de ez nem bántó, mert gyakorlatilag csak erről szól a játék.
Könnyed buli játéknak szánták, némi agyalással, és erre tökéletes is.

Not a bad little game, really. Play your cards and make sure they stay played, that's the basic idea. Other players will play cards that force you to take yours back into your hand. The first one to play them all wins. The powers of the cards introduce the logical complexities that force you to consider your plays a couple of moves ahead. I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock my socks off.

Certainly light and with a very intensive take-that element, but also many tactical decisions and quite some fun to be had. The battle between soldiers and siege engines doesn't work very well, but the biggest problem is the endgame tendency to target the momentary leader, with potential kingmaking. Otherwise, it is a fine little game for two or three players, but chaotic with more.

Para fans del UNO con algo más de chicha (tiene cierto regusto a JCC por sus efectos rebote, sus combos y el análisis de cartas). Los jugadores tratan de desprenderse de sus cartas jugándolas en el "tablero/castillo" pero no hay sitio para todos. Cada carta es un personaje con sus "poderes especiales". Con 2 jugadores es muy táctico, con 3 es más divertido... pero con 4 o más, prefiero Ciudadelas. Me gusta la dinámica de jugar cartas que pudieran hacerte un destrozo a ti mismo y la mecánica de los soldados vs. catapultas. PROS: rápido y facil de jugar y montar. CONS: kingmaking casi siempre al jugador que va ganando. En muchas ocasiones, no encuentras la forma qen la que un efecto de la carta te resulte beneficioso, así que dedicas mucho tiempo a leer todas sólo para jugarlas y... que no suceda nada.

This is another card game where the goal is to empty your hand.  However, each card may only be played on certain locations and every card has special power text.

Has that "CCG feel" that always makes a game fun for me.  I can't define "CCG feel" very well.  Games that have it use cards with abilities, but not all games that fit that description have the "feel" (San Juan, for example, does not have it).  There has to be synergy between the cards, too.

Very cool card/tile laying strategy game.  After several plays new strategies have come up.  I've only played with 2 people, but I imagine that a 3rd or 4th would add quite a bit to the experience.  Cut throat with the heavy risk of hurting yourself (do I really want to send that card back to their hand for them to play again?).  It isn't too friendly too new players because of the amount of cards, so I'm having trouble finding people interested in playing (and spend a good amount of time helping them through their first game).  I would love to play it more.

In this latest offering from Faidutti, he revisits the medieval setting of Ohne Furcht und Adel with another card game. Players are given a set of square-ish cards which are to be played onto the table, which has a cardboard castle battlement layout. Cards are played into one of three regions: in the courtyard, on the battlements, or outside the castle. And when played, the cards will usually allow you to take some sort of special action, which is unique to the card you played. The first player to rid himself of all his cards will be the winner, which can be a tricky proposition at best.

I like the fact that there are different play areas where cards can influence other cards according to their poisition. But that's it. the fact that you must put a token each time on the card you play is anoying. And the fact the cards always get back to your hand is also pretty anoying.

In a way, Castel is the offspring of a cardgame and a boardgame. Basically, you're trying to get rid of all your character cards by placing them either inside, outside the castle or on the guardwalk. Considering that each character has a special power that affects the placement of other cards - eventually sending them back to your hand - it quickly gets tricky. The more players, the less the game becomes controllable. It has very nice illustrations.

Good game but it has to be played 3-4 times so you know what all the cards does. 

What I don't like : in our 2 players game we found its always better to take all your action to draw cards and after your whole stack is empty, then you start playing them.

Vasel writes; "If I had to pick only one Blue Box game to get, it would be a hard choice. However, I think in the long run my pick would gravitate towards Castle. A good two-player game that couples as a fun 5-player game is a rare find, and coupled with the inexpensive price and mostly good components, makes Castle a game worth getting. Most people I have taught this game to have enjoyed it on the spot, and want to play again. And since getting others to enjoy board gaming is a high priority of mine, Castle will see play, again and again. Bruno and Serge have produced an excellent little game here, and one that should be in your collection."

2-5p, 60m.
Card/tile placement with rules-on-cards.  I had wanted it ever since Bruno recommended it to me on my GeekList at http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist.php3?action=view&listid=7718 but it was hard to find.  Finally, I aquired it in a trade, August, 2005 for Draco & Co--both published in the "Blue Games" line by Descartes.

There is an interesting story on Bruno's web site about how Castle developed in parallel with Citadels.

After all that, I have only played it a few times, and no great sessions [yet].  The first time 2-player in a dim cramped coffee shop that seemed to drag.  And the second was a 3-player session with a couple of experienced Euro-gamers, where everyone missed the winning condition that you have to empty ALL your cards (both in your hand, and in your draw deck.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
2 Plays - 2P.  After a 2nd try, this game plummets from a 7, at least as a 2p game. It takes way too long for what it is with all of the cards returning to your hand.  With the amount of card text, nothing happens that is really all that exciting either.

Play cards in the castle, the courtyard or the battlements. Each card gives you a special action when played. Winner is the person who gets rid of their cards. I heard this was a tactical 2 player game, and bought it to try with 2. The game seemed too fiddly, and some cards (such as the Dragon) were more powerful than others. Sold it after 2 playings. Without having tried it with more players, I'm guessing it would become very random.

As it's often said, familiarity with all the characters makes this game more interesting.   The placing of markers on top of cards and then a knight on top of all that is a little bit messy but overall seems to be a well thought out game.

It didn't stand out enough to make it a regular, and many people pointed out that it was very luck-driven.  It was still pretty fun though.

First impression: Playing is fun but on the chaotic side even with just 3 players. It seems to be about the same experience with 4/5 players. There is just a bit less turns per player and things get even more uncontrollable. There is lots of text in cards so first game will be quite a challenge in trying to see what they can do. Not a good choice of a game if you only play every now and then and/or with players without too much gaming experience because of the cards.

Chaotic and opaque little game with more screwage than even a hardened wargamer should be expected to handle. Essential to learn the cards to get any sort of meaningful experience out of a deceptively simple mechanic. Component quality is seriously disappointing when much more could have been done - see Infinite City for the way to get this sort of thing right. Not to be attempted with more than three players!

RATING: 6
I can't fathom why this game's rated 14+, except perhaps for some illustrations of females on the cards (see below for additional comments on this). As another Geek noted, this game could easily to taught to an 8-year-old, as the basic info about how to play a card is right on the cards themselves. 

Nothing special, but at the same time it is well thought-out and obviously well play-tested, as ending the game victoriously requires some specific cards. The quality of the thick card-stock and the amusing artwork are also pluses--though some might find some of the illustrations of females in the "PG-13" category.

Acquired in trade, Dec. 2008. Traded, March 2010, not because I thought it a poor design, but because it was obvious I wasn't going to get more than one other person at a time to play it.

Since I've been trying to freshen up my collection list, I went through my game closet. Forgot I owned this! Broke it out for some nongamer friends and had a lot of fun with it. Very easy to teach, takes maybe 3 or 4 plays to really master it, and it's pretty replayable. Excellent filler game, experienced players should bang through it in 30ish minutes. 

The endgame can lead to some AP and feels slightly anticlimactic, but the rest of the play is outstanding. Nice, light, fast, smart.

aka "How Many Cards Do You Have Left" because that's all you hear thru the end game. One king maker play after another against whoever is closest to going out and flip a coin otherwise.

Well done game.

Nice blend betwen tile placing and Uno. This also plays in a shorter time than Ruse & Bruise.

RATING: 7.5
There is only one castle that you must protect/attack/find sanctuary! Each player starts with a hand of characters and a draw pile, then you start placing and drawing further cards. The winner is the one who has no more cards, your players/cards have found sanctuary in the castle and live outside like dirty hobbits. The excitement in the game is the characters abilities and interactions between other placed characters. For example the sluty spinster (I think the actual name for the card is mistress)is not allowed in the castle if the queen is in the castle,which makes sense. If you have the spinster card you can swap the card with the characters that are on the table separate to the castle, but this takes one action easily spent else where. A more fun strategy would be to remove the queen from the castle, then place the spinster in the castle. Two problems with the game is the writing on the cards are too small and it just doesn't get too exciting when in play. I like this game but when I get it to the table the other players want to play something more meaningful and not as random. I find this part of the charm.

Didn't make the cut as it is not as exciting as other games in the market. On the other hand I am always happy to play this!

Fine for two, but truly excellent for three or four, this is a game of tactics, rather than strategy, with emphasis on what you combinations you can make with what ends up in your hand in any given round.

Rating for 2, 3 and 4 players (3 appears to be the best balance between luck and 'planning'). Significant luck element in a game where the central purpose is to screw the other player(s).

I've played this game twice now, once with four players and once with three. I like it. A nice mix of luck (the cards you draw) and strategy (using the abilities of the cards you get, the battle between Soldiers and Siege Weapons, etc). The only problem I have with it is that with each card having its own rule-bending ability, the rules don't adequately explain what happens in all circumstances.

Have only played as a 2 player game so far.  Play all your cards before your opponents.  After the first game, I wasn't too sure about it.  It took a while to play but this was due to getting to know what the cards all did.  Couldn't see the point in some of them ... but it turns out that is the clever part of the game.  On subsequent playings you suddenly see opportunities for a cards ability to really shine.

16-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Castel or Castle is one older game of Faidutti that I acquired because Tom Vasel liked it. 

In Castle, you manipulate people in the castle. You try to ASAP empty your hand and deck, in a tug-of-war with your opponent. All cards have special abilities, forcing your opponent to take back cards etc. In the game , you can take 3 actions. You can draw a card from your deck, trade a card from your hand to an supply of open cards OR play a card.

You play cards in the areas that they are allowed to be played in. People can be played in the courtyard, walls or outside. All cards have special abiltiies, many can only be placed on top of other cards, or next to specific cards. Each card is marked by it's 'owner', with a token to track ownership in case another card forces you to return the card to your hand or deck. 

If there are ever 4 siege engines on the outside, all soldiers on the walls are bounced back. If there are ever 4 soldiers on a wall, the siege engine opposite is bounced back.

Castel seems too random and chaotic with more than 2, but has a tactical element when you play with 2. I did like it, may become a 7 in time.

This one averages out to a 6 for me. There are games that work really well and feel like they accomplish that fun card-play and tactical nuance that clearly wants to be there, and there are others that feel like they are just in the process of doing and undoing the same thing over and over. Still, it evens out to a solid game, if a little streaky.

The object of the game is to get rid of your cards playing them in different castle areas, such as courtyard, ramparts, towers and the open field.  Every card has a special location requirement and a special power; the main one is to retrieve cards to opponents' hands, but there are others.  Nevertheless it isn't a brain burner, it can become very strategic, specially with two players.

The game looked promising in the beginning, but it fell flat really quickly. There are simply way too many character abilities to move/remove placed tiles, creating a lot of empty spaces in the courtyard. I feel the game would've been more interesting if there were more strategies in tile placement.

RATING: 4.5
Simple card game with a lot of direct conflict. The first learning 3p game was a bit chaotic, based on that single game I don't know if it's possible to evolve any strategy for the game at all. The game went to almost stalemate situation at the end as almost all cards with other card removing effects were placed except soldiers and siege engines (2 players playing soldiers and the 3rd playing siege engine). Want to try again, but don't have high expectations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played 1 game with 3P and another with 5P. Castle is a board game which masquerades as a card game as there's a strong spatial element involved. It's simple and highly tactical with plenty of opportunities for screwing with your opponent. A chaotic filler which needs a helping of luck to do well in.

The first round of Castel was confusing due to the numerous cards and interlocking combinations of these. But who takes the time to get to now the character's abilities and combinations gets rewarded with a frantic, yet lightly strategic tile-laying game of messing over your opponents. Bruno Faiduttis characteristic design-style permeates this game as well and friends of Faiduttis other games will definitely enjoy Castel, especially as a 2-player game which is less chaotic and a tad more strategic.

RATING: 5
Ok, this was the precursor to Citadels and boy am I glad to say that Citadels is a WAY better game. Players essentially play characters from their deck and hand to  the table. First person to rid their hand of cards wins.

There's alot of different card effects including many 'take that' ones. Be wary of focusing on one person and letting another player quietly sneak in a victory. The 2 player games takes TOO long and the 5 player games are rather chaotic. Good fun but not my cup of tea.

The free expansion on BGG may help. Have yet to play it!

Very nice tactical game where all players are trying to dump their cards.  All the special powers create a nice feel of intrigue and story in the court and its surroundings.  Lovely art, and ease of play makes this something that I might introduce to people that have only played Magic.  In fact, whatever nigling I've had to play Magic has now been quashed by Castle.  YEAH!  Play with only 2 or 3 players.  Any more and it devolves into absolute chaos.

RATING: 7
Maybe I'm a little blinded by all the different role powers but I quite enjoyed this game.  In this game there are 4 walls that represent a castle.  Then players each have a hand and small deck of cards with some reserve cards on the board as well.  Each of these cards can be played in certain areas, either inside or outside the castle, along the walls, or in the towers at the corners.  Some cards have other placement criteria such as adjacent to a specific character as well.  Finally, each card played also has a special ability, most commonly bouncing other characters back to their owner's hand.  This is because the goal is to exhaust all of your cards first.

Sure, this is very luck dependent.  Some cards are much more powerful than others giving you extra plays or bouncing multiple cards back to other player's hands but at the same time enough options are present to each player that this should even it out a bit.  Also, if playing correctly players should be identifying the biggest threat and targeting them first/most.  This could certainly create a kingmaker problem as well but in the end I enjoyed the game.  It has many of the things I typically enjoy in a game and is a great 30-minutes or less filler as well.

This rating is unfair, I think the game deserves more, but the games I've played of it haven't been very fun.  That is evil because I think the game is better than my rating suggests, but sometimes a game just seems cursed.  I've played it with two players, and with more, and it just hasn't worked with the people I play it with.  That said, unlike the "3" rating guideline suggests, I [i]am[/i] open to playing it again, and want to, as I have often taken the game myself and just read the cards and thought that it would be fun to play again.  I want to.  But for now, the "3" remains, with an open mind.

Buy Castle and you will soon feel like you were rooked on your purchase.

Somewhere in the game description - or at the very least an inclusion in the rule book - there should have been the stipulation that a two week correspondence course was necessary for the commencement of this debris.

Learning the attributes of the cards is essential and creates a chasm of imbalance in any contest where one player is more knowledgeable than the other.

Taking the time to accomplish such a task may not be insurmountable, however,  I find myself seriously lacking in the desire to do so.  Personally,  all things being equal, I would much prefer to spend such time studying the every day habits of the dung beetle.

First Impression:
A light take-that filler that advertises chaos as fun.

It's relatively easy to set up, it's well illustrated and it's fun and interesting to check the various character abilities the first time.

As a game however it is completely chaotic. Anyone can hit anyone - and usually benefits from doing so - and that is the game. Winning becomes such a chore when players deny it on each other round after round. The only strategy that appears to exist in this game is to keep a couple of "sudden" cards for the end and pray you won't get the attention of the other players while you play mr innocent.

Overall I don't find mindless chaos entertaining and so this game is a miss for me.

Fun filler that creates a good amount of take that with the people playing the game.  One play, but I think I will enjoy it more and more.  The game is high on fun, and low on control.  Leader bashing is prevalant, also the first several turns are useless.  Once familiar with the card's powers the game plays quickly enough to forgive the flaws.

Castle is a game where you want to shed all your cards. Cards represent people who live/work in and around the castle. Cards have various placement restrictions (inside the castle, outside, on the wall, in a tower, next to other characters, etc.) and various powers that trigger when you play them.

When you play a card you put your disc on it. If that card is ever removed from the play area, it returns to the hand of the player whose disc is on it. That might not be the person who originally played it as you can manipulate discs with various cards.

You start with a hand of cards and a draw deck of cards. On your turn you do two things, which can either be draw a card from your deck, exchange a card from your hand with a public tableau of cards, or play a card. The first person to have no cards left (after resolving all the effects of their played card) wins the game.

This game has a lot of take-that back and forth. There are cards that can be downright dickish. It's a fairly light and quick game.

A board game made entirely out of Cards That Do Stuff? Sign me up! The game seems to start off a little slow, overwhelmed with a lot of choices that probably don't matter yet, but as the areas fill up it gets more competitive and tense. Good with two or three. The cards aren't really balanced, but that's okay, it gives the game some texture and keeps the interest alive. Besides, maybe some day, SOME DAY, the Prince will be useful for something. Maybe.

I play with a variant rule: You cannot use both actions on your turn to draw.

Players are given a set of square-ish cards which are to be played onto the table, which has a cardboard castle battlement layout. Cards are played into one of three regions: in the courtyard, on the battlements, or outside the castle. And when played, the cards will usually allow you to take some sort of special action, which is unique to the card you played. The first player to rid himself of all his cards will be the winner, which can be a tricky proposition at best.

A strange game and not what I had expected when I first played. I don't like the fact that so many characters just send others back to players' hands. It simply doesn't feel particularly fun to do that to others (unless, of course, you're a big UNO fan). Maybe someone who enjoys that UNO mentality would really dig this game. As it stands, I like the game, but it doesn't blow my hair back.

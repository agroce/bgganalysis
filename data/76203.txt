The theme is irrelevant, but this is a fun 2p game that can be finished pretty quickly.  The 16 available neutral characters offer up good variety, so this game should stay fresh.  Would recommend if you like quick 2p back and forth type games.

Surprising tile-placement game for two. Can be played in less than 10 minutes and the good amount of different tiles guarantee lots of variety.

2-Spieler-Spiel. Figuren legen, ihre Funktionen nutzen und wen am Ende nach 3 Runden die meisten Figuren angucken, gewinnt.
Nett für zwischendurch.

Remarkably simple and easy game. Either it's too easy and therefore I'm over-rating it, or my oppo was a push-over and I'll down-rate it in future. Light, easy, inoffensive, not sure it's really fun if not more of a challenge.

A fast game, with quite some thinking on where to place your "people". It plays so fast that two can play 6 rounds without even noticing!

Players take turns placing tiles until the 9 squares are filled up. Tiles have effects like turning or destroying and the objective is to have more tiles facing you than your opponent.

Very simple, quick to play, and replayability is high due to the random tiles that are drawn for each game. It reminds me a lot of Neuroshima hex -- but much simpler. The art though is incredible. I just really like the look of the game.

Found it for 5€ on a local boardgame flea market and picked it up out of curiosity. A very nice little abstract game in a cool package.

I like this game. Playing is pretty much limited to no more than 10 minutes so it can see a best of 5 in less than an hour which makes it pretty dynamic. Add in the random 'neutral' tiles and you've got a massive amount of replayability on a 3x3 gameboard. Very simple ruleset and a nice overall artistic presentation (on the minimal side) makes this a worthy addition to an Abstract Strategy collection.

I also think that the overall BGG score is undeserving.

A brilliant design in all respects; the neutral cards added to the already good "RR" are sheer genius. Get this version rather than the ugly remake "CLASH: Jihad vs. McWorld".

Love the theme and design. Easy to understand and learn. Some of the symbols are a bit confusing and the unexpected surprises aren't as satisfying as they should be. Very creative idea!

Note: I finally got a few serious game of this in and I really like it. It's very quick and slightly random but there's still a lot there...

Seiji Kanai does his usual trick of updating a traditional form with lots of special powers, but this time it's a Shogi-inspired positional abstract rather than a card-game. A bigger box than his other games but just as minimalist a design. I'm not usually that keen on perfect-information games, but I did like that 5 neutral special powers are chosen from a larger pool each game for variability.

This game is for two players and made by Seiji Kanai. You take the role of the royals or the religious and you try to get most allies on the board sized 3x3. Allies are the people on the tiles that you see straight up on the board. If you place a tile then you can then use its effect. Effects may include: turning tiles, flipping tiles or removing tiles.

Each player starts the game with seven own tiles and five neutral tiles also come into play. The neutral tiles can also be used by either player in turn in addition to their own tiles. The game comes with sixteen neutral tiles so variation is guaranteed.

Fun and easy game with depth. Tip!

Cool clever game! Perfect information game, but with fantasy art and various units with special powers, giving a euro or ameritrash vibe. The basic rules are really simple, the game plays in a short time, and the random 5 neutral cards give high replay value through variety.

It's a good 2-player game with fast pace, and well balance. I played several times in one hour and enjoy playing it. Besides, nice art and high quality of tiles and board make me satisfied at buying this game by air mail from Japan. I think this game has a lot of variants in each play and has opportunities to extend by more extensions and tiles.

RATING: 7
It's very simple, it plays very quickly, and the neutral tiles keep it interesting. It does seem likely that it's both simple enough to be solvable and biased towards one player or another with some configurations, but those aren't obstacles to the kind of semi-serious play I subject it to: I'm interested in a two player filler, and at that it excels.

I think in a cheaper package -- say, a deck of regular cards with a cloth board or no board at all -- it could be a hit. As a small-press game with very solid components, it was expensive to import, probably too expensive to really justify.

I want to keep playing this to see how much of it comes down to good play, because at this point, I'm not entirely sure. It is beautifully produced though.

RATING: 7
Rated as a quick filler. Quick tactical abstract with very good components (much better than offered by most other Japon Brand games). For a very reasonable price you get a sturdy box, a mounted board and really thick tiles with interesting artwork as playing pieces. Gameplay boils down to picking a tile (one of your own or one from the general supply) and placing it on the board. Then resolve its effects. The player with the most allies after the 9 positions of the board are filled up wins the game. Easy to bring to the table because of its simple rules and a very short playing time! Also, my girlfriend and my son (9) both like it!

Plays incredibly quick (almost too quickly!) but is still an enriching game experience.

The art is unreal - which is certainly a plus.

This is a great 2 player filler that you can wedge in several games of before the next big one.

Highly recommended.

Open information non-luck 2-player strategy game. Players start with an equal set of tiles that are placed on a 3x3 board. Tiles ar always placed so they face you, but the tile effects can and will cause adjacent (or other) tiles to be turned or killed. The player with the most tiles facing him when all 9 squares are filled wins the game. What makes this interesting is the 5 neutral tiles that are randomly drawn from a stack of 16 at the game start. These neutral tiles can be used by both players but are never replenished; they're just part of the game setup. Thus the game changes for each game, but there is  no luck of the draw during the game.

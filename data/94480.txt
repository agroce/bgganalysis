Yet another very solid design by Bernd Brunnhofer.  There's seems to be commonalities to his games: very polished and well-play tested, easy to jump into and play, some randomness but more strategy than initially meets the eye, plays 2-4 players, and works best as a 2er (IMO), and has a certain "I want to play this game again" intangibles.

The goal of the game is to the score the most points (big surprise), and the game is played over 6 rounds (epochs).  The number of turns in a round is variable as a round ends when either: a) all of the god tiles have been obtained, and/or b) all of the loot/treasure tokens have been obtained.  There are really only three major ways to score points: 1) temples placed/built on the board (the more built, the better, and then some, think orange people in St. Petersburg but to a much lesser extent), and 2) demi-god tokens which are generally obtained as loot, and 3) acquiring god tokens.  You also score a bonus 3 points for ending a round.  You choose from one of the following actions each turn: 1) grab three cards (money, feet, or sacrifice), 2) obtain a god tile (which grant special abilities as well as points), 3) do a movement action, in order to obtain loot and/or build temples (points), 4) do a money action, in order to obtain sacrifice tiles (used as permanent discounts for god tokens), or buy more feet and/or temples, or buy your movement action.

The theme of the game is the rise and fall of nations and their conquering of regions and devotion to the gods of the time (Greek mythology sort of).  The components are very nice, with nice solid tiles, and full-sized(!) quality cards, and feet-meeples!  My wife loves this game, as she does all of Brunnhofer's designs, and I quite enjoy it too despite the occasional randomness of card and tile draws.  This one should've garnered serious consideration for the SdJ this year, but of course wasn't even nominated (what a joke).

Das Spiel kennt sehr viel Zufall; eine vorgefasste Strategie zu Spielen ist nur mit Glück möglich - wichtiger (erfolgreicher) ist das Spielen der Karten, die einem auf die Hand kommen.
Das Spielmaterial ist sehr schön.

[b]Variante aus der Spielbox 2011/3[/b]

1. Vor der Partie zu Dritt sind 3 und vor einer Partie zu Zweit 5 der Plättchen mit kleineren Werten (1 bis 3) blind zu entfernen. Für den seltenen Fall, dass nun doch alle Halbgötterplättchen benötigt werden, sind die anfangs aussortierten wieder hinzuzunehmen, jedoch darf man sich je ausstehender Wertung drei zusätzliche Siegpunkte gutschreiben.

2.Für Bewegungen dürfen auch Opferkarten eingesetzt werden, aber nur drei (beliebige) oder ein Vielfaches davon auf einmal. Jede Karte bringt dann einen Bewegungspunkt. Beispiel: Hat man den großen Fuß, eine Bewegungskarte und drei Opferkarten, so kann man sechs Schritte machen. Zwei Operkarten allein reichen jedoch nicht für eine Bewegung. 

Außerdem kann man mit den Opferkarten Geld generieren. Hier werden fünf Opferkarten in drei Geld umgewandelt. Auch hier müssen es immer fünf Karten oder ein Vielfaches davon sein. Ein Tausch bzw. Umwandlung ist keine besondere Aktion, sondern geht mit der Aktion, mit welcher die Karten verwendet werden, einher.

I love both St.Petersburg and Stone Age. Pantheon is a good design made by the same author. Game time lasts about 1 hour. Rules can be explained easily. It's a very good gateway game for beginners. Experienced boardgame players will enjoy it too if they want to look for something shorter and lighter after a couple of Agricola games in the late evening. Highly recommended!

Pantheon strikes me as quite an original confection.  I struggle to think of other games to liken it to.  There are essentially three ways to score vps; by building columns, by picking up demi-gods and by buying the favours of the gods.  Since the first two involve building routes, it is important not to ignore that element of the game.  Actually, those columns are really important.  That's about all I can offer as strategic advice because Pantheon is a highly tactical game, with the cards you draw determining what you can do from turn to turn.  Timing is also important, with rounds tending to accelerate towards the end as players assemble route building and favour acquiring engines.  It hasn't happened in my three plays but I can see the potential for a round to end before one or more players take a turn. This seems an uncharacteristic sharp edge from Brunnhofer and Hans im Gluck. 

Ultimately, Pantheon is one of those middle weight  games that Hans im Gluck is so adept at producing.  The rules are straightforward, there are plenty of significant decisions and a fair amount of luck in the form of card and tile draws.  It is quite pleasant to play from time to time.

If a credible theme is important to you, then note that Pantheon is at the "this makes no sense" end of the spectrum.  We represent members of various civilizations.  We wander about, collect some bonus tiles and then disappear, to re-emerge, as members of another civilization.

Production quality is up to HiG's usual standards.  The artwork is very kitsch indeed.

Quite a bit of luck in this one - especially the token draw at the start of the game.

The person to the left of the person that ends the round will also have a huge advantage. If different people end the rounds it won't be a problem, but if the same people end them it will be.

Despite the above complaints an ok experience.

RATING: 1
The big problem with the game is the variance in the bonus tiles and the strong first player advantage (made stronger by some really good bonus tiles). Essentially, this is a game where you don't want to be last... thus, players will draw cards over-and-over again in order to avoid ending the round themselves, and thus going last. If you play with competitive people on BSW... it's not uncommon for the draw-deck to be recreated and the whole process to start again.

Essentially, your greatest asset in this game is to be playing with an idiot to your right... someone who will happily take that last tile so that you can go first.

After my first play I wrote: 'A polished production as was expected from Bernd Brunnhofer.  Not exciting, but offering a number of choices.  Some tiles seemed strong in combinations - 2 x 1 extra cards, etc.  But then all players have a chance to buy.  Minor quibble, in that one player suffered late when the only pillar positions close by were ones she already had a pillar, so for no fault of her own her options uniquely were more limited.  Lots of variety in set up.  Happy to play again.'

After speaking with people in the know, they highly recommended playing again as it had become one of their favourites of the year.  I did, then again immediately for third time.  Second play was much better and better than expected.  Hugely rewarding, all decisions are difficult, minor quibbles melted away.  This is an excellent design, but do play it for a second time if you are not convinced by the first.  Rating upped from 7 to 8.5.

Third play of day and fourth to date, I feel the game is playing me, rather than vice versa.  You make plans, don't get the cards, and have to make plan B work, then plan C, etc.  An enjoyable journey, with a luck element that will favour some players.  In none of the four games to date have the scores been close!  Re-rated 8.

Further plays.  I enjoy the journey, but the random factor is quite high.  In seventh game, rounds 3, 4 and 5 ended in consecutive turns, as each player 'walked' and other followed, removing all tokens.  I suspect the game was not designed to be quite that quick!  Certainly put paid to my gods stategy with two unused extra turn gods :-(

8th game.  Think I've burned out on this.  But if I got this much value out of all games I played I'd be more than happy.  Bought all four extra turn tiles - played all in round 5 in one turn - 28 points!

In conclusion, I think there is a lot more luck in this game than there first appears.  This is good for a family market, but the game does not warrant the effort I put in to get this level of undestanding of it.

Excellent! this game along with Stone Age made me a fan of Mr. Brunnhofer. Paul Lister (sorp122) praised this game and he was correct. It is a family game but also a gamers game, a rare quality also found in Stone age. It is civ-themed which I love and it provides developing choices over an hour and a half. Almost perfect. I wished for a more robust design to rate it a perfect 10, but still! You did it again Mr Tummelhofer/Brunnhofer!

Pantheon is a both a heavier family game and a light gamer's game, so it is targeted at the same players as Stone Age (the previous game by the same author). Like Stone Age, Pantheon has gorgeous components, but the similarities end here...
The game is quite abstract, but it is fast and enjoyable: the scoring is divided between Pillars, Gods and Demigods; the pace of the game is chosen by the players and the decisions are light but meaningful. There's of course some luck involved, but nothing that can hurt a game of this weigh...
In the end, there's nothing new here, but everything is blended in a good way to create an enjoyable experience. Eager to play it again!

This game is very fun.  It is easy to learn and has enough decisions to make it entertaining.  After a few plays, I think that game has quite of bit of luck involved, which is not a problem for me.  I pull the game out when I play against individuals who like board games, but who have much less gaming experience than me.  Though there is strategy, it seems like everyone who plays the game has a chance.  For me, the game fills a weird, yet nice nitch.  I won't be playing it all the time, but I am really glad that I have it on the shelf when I want it.

(Impression based on a short sample game.) Pantheon [i]looks[/i] to be a sort-of crayon game in disguise as players seek to walk across a map looking for sites to place sacred and valuable pillars. After a short while most paths orginating from a center position (representing the capital of a civilization worshipping a set of gods) have been taken, and then the center moves to a different spot on the map, erasing the existing paths. The thematic explanation is that the civilization has ended, and a new one has risen to power. This idea of walking from a moving center point  is nice and certainly refreshing. In addition to the above players try to appease gods of every civilization in order to have these gods help the players with bonus actions, points, and other goodies; But in order to make full use of their powers it helps if you recover artefacts too: several are scattered around the central location. If the artifacts are gone then the civilization also crumbles: a new set is put in place around the capital of a new civilization. Simple and effective.

Unfortunately Pantheon uses a bit of an uninspiring draw stack as the engine with which the players can effect their actions. Basically this amounts to figuring out how to play various hands under the right circumstances; it's not really much different from games like Tigris and Euphrates, Hacienda, and many others. But whereas these games allow for slow build-up of complex patterns, Pantheon has various rules in place which limit, block and move around paths very rapidly and then rely on various card tricks and special god powers to circumvent these. The resulting game is far more tactical and ad hoc than I would like to see, and given the artificial nature of what I needed to do coupled with the totally fake god names soured me rather quickly on it as a whole.

A decent game which I have played a lot at Brettspielwelt.com (155 times), but only once at the table with my copy. I would like it considerably better if it weren't for a couple of luck elements which are a little over the top for my taste:
1. There is an extreme luck factor in when Germania and Graecia are drawn. One option to remedy that might be to make their effects less severe.
2. Another way too high luck factor comes with randomly drawing a god with the one gods bonus tile at the beginning of the game. Some of the gods are quite weak to start with, while drawing a Gadicea or Stonkus+2 (let alone even preceded by a Surparit which gives an additional VP) at the very start of the game is extremely strong. This problem could be remedied by just getting rid of this one bonus tile.

Theme-wise, I would prefer it to feature "real" ancient gods instead of the made-up, pseudo-ancient ones. I am baffled that this is not the case because you play real-world historical peoples. Why not also feature their historical gods?

Initial rating after one play. This seems to be a nicely themed euro with some interesting mechanics. Game play was actually about 120 minutes, but I suspect that would drop to 90 minutes with repeated play. There's a lot to explain, but once you get the hang of it things flow fairly quickly. It's a shame the player aid cards weren't more helpful.

On the downside it seems obvious to me that certain gods are much more useful and powerful than others. The god that provides an extra move seems quite overpowered, and will probably decide the game's result since there's no downside to using it for that ability. And, as others have suggested, the net result may be that the luck of the turn order and the god tiles that happen to come into play may have more to do with final victory than any particular strategy. The fact that a fourth player can be locked out completely during a turn is a major strike against the game.

While there aren't a lot of new concepts here, I have a hard time comparing it to anything else.   There's hand management, set collection, and a little bit of engine building and route building.   Cards are played in sets to earn god tiles, and map play is used to build columns, but the god points seem to be more important.   The randomization of map zones bonus chits makes the game a little bit unpredictable, and I'm not sure if that's good or bad yet.   Don't need to own it, but worth a few more plays.  Reasonably priced.

Kipróbáltuk 3 fővel, ami szerintem nem a legideálisabb játékos szám. Kedves feleségem a szabálymagyarázat után kijelentette, hogy neki nem szimpatikus ez a játék, ami rá is nyomta a bélyegét az egész játékra :). Valahogyan nehezen emésztette meg azt, hogy amikor valamelyik játékos a mozgás fázist választja, akkor utána a többiek is mozoghatnak és csak ennek végén, amikor a nagy láb visszakerül a közös készletbe, akkor kezdődik meg a következő játékos köre. Ráadásul, az is zavart okozott, hogy amennyiben nem akarsz mozogni (egy másik játékos mozgás akciójában), helyette húzhatsz egy lapot a húzópakliról. Viszont a 4 választható akció közül az egyik az, hogy felhúzol 3 lapot (ezt nem csak a húzópakliról, hanem a "felcsapott" 4 lap közül is választhatod, akár vegyesen is). Így rendszeresen gond volt, hogy akkor most mennyi lapot is húzhat, vagy pedig más játékos mozgás akciójában próbált más akciót végrehajtani. Jómagam azt a stratégiát választottam, hogy próbáltam minél több oszlopot felpakolni és zsákmánylapkát megszerezni, lemondva az istenlapkák megszerzéséről, amihez jól jött kezdésből egy láb bónusz lapka, ami plusz egy mozgás lehetőséget biztosított, amit a játék során még sikerült további 3 láb lapkával plusz egy olyan istenséggel, ami szintén egy lábat adott, így elég nagy volt a mozgásterem a többiekkel szemben, akik inkább isteneket szerettek volna begyűjteni, ami szerintem sokkal nehezebb, vagyis egy hosszabb folyamat eredménye. Én még megnézném újra, hogy mi lenne akkor, ha több játékos is az oszlopfelhelyezős stratégiát választja és mindezt 4 játékossal. Sajnos erre most nem látok esélyt, miután a többieknél nem aratott olyan osztatlan sikert. Így pedig jó szívvel ajánlani sem tudom. (2017.03.28.)

Aránylag egyszerű szabályok, gyors elemi lépések, pörgős játékmenet. Érdekes mechanizmus, ahogy minden fordulóbán más nép kerül játékba. Az egyetlen ami nem tetszett, hogy sok ponton van aránylag nagy szerencseszerep, néhol szinte már direkt erőltetetten. Elég nagy a különbség az istenek és a félistenek között is. Nomeg a kártyahúzással egész be is lehet szorulni, ha valamiből egyáltalán nem jut neked. A nagy értékű kártyák visszakeverése, majd ezután pusztán mázliból felhúzása meg tényleg teljesen felesleges.
Azért mindenképp szeretnék még esélyt adni neki, mert alapjaiban nagyon tetszik.

My first impression of Pantheon was that there is quite a lot to explain, especially taking into account that it is aspiring to be a family game. Once the game has started you'll get the hang of it quickly because it really isn't all that complicated.

Pantheon is a game of going with the flow, trying to make the best of the cards you are dealt. You can make as many plans as you like but if the Gods don't look down favourably on you those plans will whither away more quickly than the ancient civilisations.

The luck factor is considerable. Some powers are clearly more valuable than others, and it seems that if a player gets lucky early on there is little hope to prevent a run-away leader. Similarly, there is nary a thing you can do but watch from the sidelines if things don't go your way. For a game of this length that is fairly irritating.

From the designer of Stone Age comes a game that has the same playing time but feels faster and more fun, replacing the tedious worker placement with a simple card play that is reminiscent of Ticket to ride. Yes, every element in Pantheon is random, but that makes the game infinitely variable and replayble. An undeservedly neglected gem!

Found this at a con with absolutely no background information and had no idea what to expect, but it's actually really great. It's basically a slightly more advanced Ticket to Ride type game with a much cooler theme, and some interesting mechanics that force you to build on different parts of the board at different points in the game. It may be a bit too fiddly/setup heavy for the truly casual gamer, but it plays surprisingly fast with much less downtime than I expected and I actually like it more than the basic TTR games (though not necessarily better than all the TTR games).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Based on three plays with 4 players I must admit that the game concept is quite interesting and that the game flow itself is ok.  However, the luck factor and the potential for frustration is far too high for a game of +90 minutes.  Furthermore it is *really* annoying that a round can end with some players having no chance of taking their own action.  Therefore my rating for this game is "could be talked into occasionally"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Nice theme and pretty artwork, but the game underneath is a quite abstract system with a mix of common mechanics. I found my only game fairly enjoyable, and there are several strategic paths to explore, but also many random elements, most with potential to be decisive. Luck does play a big role, and in many moments it will greatly favor or severely harm a player, sometimes causing huge swings in victory points.

RATING: 5
An incredibly dry, bland, and derivative game.  Not a single original mechanic.  It does work pretty well, and the designer chose many nice mechanics to steal, but the overall package just didn't do it for me.  The combination of various mechanics didn't seem interconnected enough, reminiscent of a Ystari game where a whole bunch of well thought out mechanics are combined with little rhyme or reason.  The card draw system (blatantly stolen from ticket to ride) worked fine until it bogged down with stuff no one wanted and from that point on we just drew off the top.  Some of the tactical choices are interesting but the overall strategy is not, because of the integration of the phases of the game.  Everyone needs feet, everyone has to do some columns, and everyone has to buy god tiles.  You can choose to concentrate on one thing as a strategy, but you will lose to people who simply play strategically and whose areas of concentration are dictated to the by position in the game.  Another player stated that he thought there was a formula to winning the game- get feet early, build your items so you can always buy a god tile if you need it, and then just grind points.  I'm not 100% sure its that simple, but I know I'm not a big fan of the game.  

Also, this is another game that takes language independence to silly levels, requiring frequent rulebook references to decipher the many icons.  This isn't a problem for a lot of euros because serious players will learn the icons after a game or two.  It IS a problem for a game like Pantheon, which lies somewhere between a gateway game and a medium-weight euro.  For casual gamers, the icons will be frustrating to interpret, and for even hardcore gamers, you aren't going to play this enough to learn them all.  So, keep that rulebook out.

The game is also about half an hour too long for something this lightweight.

The Ticket to Ride style card drawing is a bit tired, but everything else is pretty interesting. I'm a little concerned about luck... Pantheon really straddles the line between luck and skill, and I'm not entirely convinced that skill can overcome luck, but I'm willing to play more to find out. If player control turns out to be just an illusion, well... at least it is a well crafted illusion.

Later on is not much better.  The game is very very mechanical and there is NO connection to logical actions imaginable in fantasy setting like this one (and who the heck are players and what's their goal anyway??!).

Fun'ish medium-weight euro. Quite a bit of luck and correct timing plays a big role (e.g. don't go last in the last turn).

A somewhat plain and flavorless game system is given a boost by having several gods, tiles and bonus counters with special abilities that let you tweak and enhance your regular actions.

Still, the whole thing does come across as a bit bland and abstract. I am not sure I will be playing this a year from now.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2017)

Pantheon was one of my oldest unplayed games. I bought it on July 2013!. My desire to play it was low but its name appeared on my game system so I had to play it. After having played it, I can say it really surprised me. It was much better than expected and I enjoyed it.

My copy of the game was new, but it came with some missing pieces. I was going to see if I could get them from Rio Grande Games, but then I sold the game as it was.

Phanteon´s rules can be taught under 12 minutes. Playtime is around 100 minutes.

The game´s components are ok and they look great on the board. The art of the game is ok.

I love the theme.

The game´s decisions aren’t very complex, however they aren’t obvious either. It has a light-medium weight. There are many ways to earn VPs. On your turn you can draw cards, move (which open the movement option to all players), purchase cards and/or tiles, make an offering to get one time or permanent effects. There are lots of moving parts. Every age you play under the regime of a new civilization which different setup rules and that keeps the game fresh (I love this feature). The rounds can be played very quickly or very slowly, gauging this isn’t obvious and if you miscalculate you can lose a lot of VPs.

Luck plays a part in the game, but I feel you can mitigate it with good play. The order in which the god cards appear cannot be controlled and some of them seem very powerful.

I would have loved it a couple of years ago, as it is, I enjoy it but I had to let it go. If I’m completely honest, I´m a bit sad I had to sell it, but I need to be ruthless if I’m going to get my collection under control.

Bottom line, I was surprised by Pantheon. It is a decent Euro game. I liked it much more that I thought I would. It is an ok game for me but I would gladly play it again. I already sold it, but I sold it to a friend, so hopefully, I can play it whenever I want. The game is not very complex so it can be a good family game.

Good medium weight Euro with some pleasing mechanisms.

The art is pretty terrible and the suits could just as well be colours though.

Being able to control the length of the rounds was enjoyable as well as building the routes on the board with 4 players. I would definately say that the game was better with 4 than with 3. Have yet to see a heavy 'god' strategy win out but i'm sure that it is possible.

Enjoyed it more on my second play when the end result was visibly a function of our decisions. BTW, what was Vohwinkel thinking when he designed this cover?
--------
I give Pantheon the benefit of doubt as a few people whose opinions I usually trust claim that it gets better with more plays when single unlucky experiences even out. On my first play, luck dominated strategy and upgrading the worship tiles was obligatory to remain competitive at all. Hopefully, that's groupthink and mediocre play on our behalf. More experience could reveal diverging strategies. Rarely have I been so unsure about a game after one play.

Non-intuitive game play, crappy summary card and boring looks combine with the feeling of a too quick game flow to bog down this one.

I don't understand why this game doesn't have more positive comments. My friend, her kids, and I have played it a lot and we've always enjoyed it. Kids started at 8 and 10 so wasn't so competitive to start, but now that they are teenagers this is a whole new game of strategy for us. There are some elements of luck and randomness but that keeps the game fresh. Plus, taking advantage of the tiles that come up and the cards you draw is part of the strategy of the game. The movement action is unique because everyone gets to move if one player chooses a movement action. It feels like you're giving others a free turn if you choose a movement action, but you have to balance that with the advantage of moving first. You can also pay coins for movement. The timing for ending an epoch can be important since the location and tiles all reset. There are a lot of different strategies that can successfully lead to victory which in my opinion gives this game great replayability. I think it's a better game than most people give it credit for. My guess is that they just haven't played it enough to appreciate all the nuances. Also worth noting is the beautiful art work on the cards and sacrifice tiles. I think this game deserves more praise and I highly recommend it as a good family play.

Overall the game is alright. Lovely game if this is your first few games. However, having played more and more games (old and new) every year, the pitfalls of this game become very obvious.

RATING: 7
I had high hopes for this initially, given the pedigree and what I'd read about this game, but my feelings are a little bit mixed. My first two games were played as a 2-player game, and my overwhelming feeling was that luck dominated the game. With two players almost any point-scoring move can set your opponent up to end the epoch, and score big points. Thus, the game becomes a bit of a mexican standoff. It's better to stall and make a big move than to make lots of smaller moves.

I then played this game with 3 players, and the game felt considerably better, so much so that I'm eager to try it with four. On the surface, it doesn't seem like player numbers should impact the gameplay, but in reality it seems it does. My score will likely rise if playing with more players improves the game.

As to the components and artwork: this is the standard quality that we've come to expect from games assembled by LudoFact. Thick cardboard, and nice custom-shaped wooden bits. The artwork is nice, if a bit generic, but it conveys the theme without distracting the player, so I commend it.

The first half of the game isn't bad as you build your engine, but there comes a point in the second half where it's hard to find a reason to do anything other than take a god tile every turn: Your engine allows it, and they're worth big points. Everything else in the game loses value.

In spite of its gaudy appearance and the whimsical gods, this seems to be a pretty serious game. Various resources have to be managed wisely, and the different strategies of going for columns or for gods offer the interesting dilemma of determining exactly how much you should diverge from running with the pack - if you choose a route where you’re completely on your own, you’ll be choked, but going for what everybody else wants will not earn you any laurels, either.

There is enough chance and some other stuff thrown into the whole affair to detract from this central choice and make it less of a cerebral and number-crunching game than it might have been, but I feel that this is quite a bit more strategically demanding than Stone Age. And I like it!

Played once with 3 players, so rating can get up or down, the game played fluently, there seem to be different roads to walhalla. But the problem is that the amount of luck needed with the cards is slightly unbalanced with the weight/duration of the game.
Example: You need money to buy pillars/steps/cards there is no other way to grab gold than by choosing to pick cards. throughout the whole game I picked a lot of cards, I got 2 gold coins, my opponent received 20.

I didn't fall in love with this one. While gameplay is relatively simple, the rules are really fiddly. I like the amount of luck and strategy. However, some rounds are so short, there is no time to plan or play anything. It is also just a bit too long for a civ game and begins to drag. To many mechanics just don't mesh as well as they should. Overall, not a terrible game, just not balanced or fun enough to be great.

It's fun stomping around the ancient world collecting sets of stuff so you can appease the gods.  I like the tension between picking up cards or placing on the board.  You can't do both at the same time and you don't want your opponents to block you from your goals.  An interesting connection/control game that rehashes a ton of mechanics to create a relatively original experience.  It can be tough to catch-up if you get behind but no worries, the game finishes pretty quickly.

By the same designer that brought us Saint Petersburg and Stone Age, Parthenon is a different beast...far more classic Euro than the other two and less calculable to be sure. 

The players must try to earn the favour of the Gods, which in turn will gift them powers to further their cause. A ticket to ride card collection system allows players to earn card based resources and these can in turn be converted to acquire more permanent resources. An additional centrepiece is the board itself in which the players must expand from a different part of the Mediterranean each round but how far they can travel and how easily they can build Columns (which do offer a Stone Age like end of game scoring bonus) will depend on their movement allowance and stone resources...which of course tie nicely back into the card based resources.

its all very neat really and well worth more exploration by me in 2012.

Correcto juego que puede  servir muy bien para enfricar a nuevos jugadores pero que no aportará nada nuevo a jugadores experimentados.

A hit in our house.  Forget the nonsense about randomness and instead embrace the fact that a bad card draw merely means that you should seek your VPs elsewhere.  This has similarities to Stone Age, but I think that I enjoy it a little more, as there is more to do with placing the feeples and columns in a tactical way.  In many ways this is a more open version of Stone Age, a next step along the line.  Highly recommended!

After having won the game by 40 points or so, I realized that everything that happened had nothing to do with the players. The cards come up a certain way, you're either in good or bad position, and points get scored. The fact that rounds can end before players even get a turn is ludicrous, making this a game to avoid.

A bit of a set-up on this one, but quite a bit deeper game play than I thought. It has a wide way of scoring points, but the biggest thing about it is that the turns can be very long or very short, which I think deserves some more plays to figure out the flow of the game. I'm glad I have this one and think it might be a solid 2 player game as well.

I'm becoming less of a fan of light to mid-weight, short to mid-length civilization games (Pantheon, Olympos, Olympus).  There is a lot going on here and there are several engine building/discount mechanics.  It doesn't feel as tight and consistent as Brunnhofer's other games (Stone Age, St. Petersburg) which I consider to be classics.  Unlike those games, the decisions in Pantheon seem uneven. I don't know how to describe it, but I didn't feel fulfilled.  I might have a better opinion after another play.

Draw cards and let them tell you how to progress, be it by doing lots of movement actions and placing point-scoring columns on the board (and picking up bonus chips along the way); or lots of gold and acquire sacrifice tiles, and then use these and cards to acquire gods which give all kinds of bonuses on top of the bonuses they also give. The early turns allow you to build your buying power and placement power and the last few rounds speed up dramatically as things disappear boom boom boom. Meaning there's a fair bit of luck in the turn order and in who finishes each round / starts the next round. As well as the luck in the cards. So the game can't be taken too seriously, but the decisions are pleasant and it's tricky knowing which way to go at times. So it hits about the right spot for me for a Euro - pleasant, with options to think about, without being brain burny or hitty.

[b]I love playing this!! This underappreciated gem gets crazy with some wild tactical plays.[/b] Interesting med-light set-collection card-management board game with a mythological theme and some route building. Randomness to the games' 6 epochs and the God tiles, which keeps the game fresh. The sacrifice cards and the sacrifice tiles are like resources to acquire the God tiles. The feet cards are to lay down the temporary routes. The money cards purchase the route-building components and can add to routes. Get through each of the game's nuances of the various mechanisms (none of which are new), play light and fast, and Pantheon becomes [b]much more than the sum of it's parts.[/b]

Components, cards, and tokens are med-good quality. The theme is interesting. Gameplay feels like a euro with palatable randomness. [b]Not a gateway game.[/b] I haven't played more than 2 player games, but it might go a bit too long with more players who play this as a med-heavy game when [b]it should be played as a weight like that of Ticket to Ride or Carcassone.[/b]

Nice with the expansion, but not necessary.

The art and flavor text needs a major redo. I wish the minor god tokens were a bit larger.

A nice and very short feeling game. It feels highly interactive, but ultimately also rather dry. There are a lot of chits and therefore there is alot to prepare. It can get a little bit fiddly. There is a lot going on and the game accelerates with each gaming epoch. The last epoch it may well be possible that the last player won't even be able to do one final turn. A very solid design as to expect by this author. I think I will rise my rating with additional gameplay.

Aptly for a game with feetples, this just feels like a bit of a trudge across Europe. Turn order plays a huge role, especially if there's a weaker player at the table, and although I find games that are so much about calculation fairly boring, I like pseudo-calculation (i.e. randomness masquerading as choice) even less.

Update after lots of plays on BSW: there's a lot of luck in this, and the endgame is particularly unsatisfying, but it plays quickly and there are definitely multiple routes to victory.

Everything in the game has appeared in other games however, the game works seamlessly. It has greater depth than Stone Age (by the same designer) but not as deep as any other civ game. It borders on being abstract. It is challenging and enjoyable but just this side of something that needs to be taken seriously. The random elements were a turn off to some in our group but I believe that is because they were expecting something closer to Rise of Nations, Mare Nostrum, Olympos, etc. It is closer to Stone Age than any of those games.

A very good, medium-heavy Euro. I do like the theme, although it is not implemented to a degree I would have prepared it to be. The idea that the players are not playing one civilization each, but rather control the same civilization together, trying to score VPs is intriguing and reminds me of Britannia. Unfortunately, apart from different starting positions and one unique event, all the cultures are the same and I would have wished for more variety, different gods and more historical tie-ins. 

I found that there are a lot of things you can do wrong in this game. Things that can effectively cripple you. When you build too many columns too soon, run out of cards or end up with a bad god combo, you are out of luck.

The column scoring does not make sense to me either, why give someone who is already reeking in more points due to having the most columns give the multiplier too ? This created a runaway leader in our game and I am not sure why that is necessary

That being said, all those games do not change the fact that the game is good fun.

Pantheon is pretty much a perfect mix of Stone Age and Olympos, but not quite as good as either. It's about on the same level of complexity as Olympos, filling that nice medium weight spot. There's a few different paths to victory here and it seems each one is viable. Building columns seems important, but not necessary for victory if you can grab the Minor God tokens and God tiles that give victory points.
Overall: Pantheon was a little heavier than I expected it to be, but in a good way. It's not going to replace Stone Age or Olympos, but I like it enough to keep in my collection.

Awesome game with many features that I love, including the varying epochs (each located in a different board region and with specific set-up rules), route building, development, and currency management (not just money, but feet and columns). Feels fresh and unlike any game I've played before. Notwithstanding the inexplicable box cover (which frankly prevented me from buying this game sooner), the artwork is awesome. Brunnhofer is 3 for 3 in my book.

I really enjoy the theme, and the game itself is quite nice - however, it does suffer from an apparently 'best' strategy to do with getting Stonkus and making loads of money. 

Once everyone knows, it becomes a good game - but it's not ideal, and I don't think the rest of the game is good enough to make me want to fight for it.

All in all - a good game with one slight problem that could be easily house-ruled, but shouldn't have to be!

Pretty standard euro, which sounds like damning with faint praise but it's better than that.  There are smooth systems, a feeling that you can choose various paths that aren't just the same thing in different clothes, and a quick turn sequence.
The only bit I am unconvinced by is the massive bonus for reaching the 12th column; it seems too much of a game changer.
Played twice with three, and I am pretty sure I wouldn't want to play this with four.  With three, the restriction of two colours per space is interesting, with four it could easily lead to frustration.

There's some things I really like about Pantheon.  You can tell it's the same designer as Stone Age, as you have a progressive build throughout the game and many strategic options to take.  I liked it just fine.  I guess the main trouble I had with it was that the theme seemed very uninspired.  The feet meeples were rather lame, and the art and board didn't really get me excited at all.  The box is HUGE and certainly doesn't have to be.  I wish that the presentation had a bit more and I could see myself purchasing it and enjoying it more.  The game itself though, is good, not great, and that in the long run is what will hold up the purchase.

RATING: 8
Really good game. It's much like Hacienda in trying to establish the columns, while the set collection to get the gods is a nice game balancer. I like how you can invest in your point-scoring ability by getting feet (that you get back each round) or sacrifice tiles (which make it easy to get god tiles). It's just a solid, fun, 90 minute Euro game.

I enjoyed it, but given the games lineage I thought maybe the starts had aligned for my dream game.  However, it's more like when your favorite movie stars all appear in the same movie and it doesn't all come together.  The whole is less than the sum of its parts.  It's not bad but the 90 minute play time is a bit much compared to better games like St. Pete, Finca, and Stone Age.  Would like to try some more and hopefully it will grow on me.

Based on one two player game this is top of the class for 2011 so far (April)

Lots of stuff we have seen before, with scoring divided between map and god tiles (which might have a power) and demi gods who score but have no power

Really delicious timing decisions between immediate scorting and building up. Best with four, then three then two. A little bit of luck that evens out, lots of paths to follow, specialisation a bit more important with more players, however cant ignore the map, or demi gods.

The pacing of each epoch is in control of the players and they don't follow a pattern - you can have one long one followed by two short, or lots of long or lots of short.

I have written a review here

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/645569/pantheon-a-candidate-for-spiel-des-jahres

Now twenty one games in and so far only one was decided by card draws, to any one who says this is a luck fest i'll happily play you on BSW and disprove it

Very nice family game from Brunnhofer, in the same class as Stone Age. It's a bit more fiddly, but has a lot more replayability due to the variability in the peoples and gods that turn up. I always like it when players can impact the tempo and timing in a game, which Pantheon has in spades. There's of course the luck of the draw, but that doesn't detract too much.

Not much new here -- a standard light-medium euro. Bernd Brunnhofer designs are always polished, and though Pantheon suffers from "mishmash syndrome", with many different kinds of god tiles and tokens to explain, it plays well. There's a much larger element of luck than I like, however.

Rating revised down after seeing multiple games in which poor card draws at the wrong time ruined one or more players. The "7-card" civilizations are needed to prevent stockpiling until the final epoch when gods are worth the most points, but they are also crippling to a player hasn't been able to do anything but draw due to a lack of useful cards, usually feet.

RATING: 8
First impressions were positive, but not ecstatic, perhaps due to lacking a feel for the value of investing, and general unfamiliarity. For example: one round started with everyone having to draw or discard to 7 cards. Great news for the player with no cards; less great for the player with 14 cards! Of course - next time it won’t be a surprise, and next time the rules teacher will mention such details.

The end-of-round trigger is reminiscent of Grand Cru (which I’ve never really warmed to).

Most reservations bring to mind the reservations I had with my first few plays of St Petersburg or Stone Age. Both of these games went on to become favourites, so I'm still hoping for Pantheon. 

{update: one reservation (overpowered demigods) was due to a rules error: low-valued demigod tiles should be drawn before high-value ones}

RATING: 7
Set collection game with a Greek god theme. The aim is to place as many monuments onto the board as possible as these provide victory points in the game's two scoring rounds. In order to do this the player has to balance the optimum use of their actions, such as acquiring more monuments and movement pieces, acquiring god tokens that bestow particular benefits to their owner, and compiling sets of cards which make the first two options possible. This is an intriguing game to play and the key to victory is to maximise the use of the god tokens you've obtained throughout the game, especially if you can get hold of duplicate tokens i.e. one god provides extra money for purchases, which is particularly powerful when combined with the same god, whereas another awards victory points aligned to a certain type of tile and this god can also be used in multiples. Designer Bernd Brunnhofer is better known for higher regarded games such as 'Saint Petersburg' and 'Stone Age' but I don't think that 'Pantheon' is too far away in terms of quality from its more famous siblings.

But I actually don't want to play the game because of the careless slapped on theme.

Each game played out completely differently depending on the order of the loot tiles and god tiles coming out. Certainly some god tiles are more valuable than others if they come out early, so I wonder if it would have been better to have separate stages of god tiles that come out in groups like Egizia does with the Nile cards. The games were certainly enjoyable and decisions seem to be very tough at times. The game should have good replayability due to the quantity of extra god and loot tiles and the sequence in which these come out.

The art may prove to be Pantheon's undoing.  The game is fine, although not as breathtakingly groundbreaking as some of the designer's previous titles.  It's just too much to learn for a middleweight Euro, and Pantheon feels flat for having so much board activity.  The bigger problem is the comic book-style box and the deliriously busy board, which conspire to make the game look juvenile.  Brace for low sales volumes.

Seems to be a decent game, but I  am not sure how much it depends on luck. Being able to end a round seems to be a very powerful situation, and it does perhaps not necessarily depend on skill to get there. Need to play more games to be sure. Maybe you can setup for this power in the early rounds and there is less luck involved than I think now.

We enjoyed playing this. The luck factor is significant, but there is plenty of strategy to keep you engaged. Lots of options to look at.

Really love this game so far. The play time is short, which I wasn't expecting for such a full game, and it plays great with two.

Updated 06/26/2012: The game is good out of the box, but there is a recommended variant for 2 and 3 player games that makes it even better. After a few more plays this is still great fun.

Good potential for replays, if slightly unbalanced.  Barb's comment is that you hardly get to do anything before a particular epoch is over.

This is a great game with great components. It is "History of the World" light. The mechanics are simple and very well integrated. It plays fast and provides a lot of excitement. There are two very clever competing mechanisms to close an era (elimination of god cards or elimination of bonus tokens). There is a lot of strategy of what, when, and how to close an era. Also the victory point system provides and provokes radical thinking on what to pursue each turn (victory points increase in each era). People may argue that there is luck in this game and that many things are more powerful than other things. Things are not equal, but too many things and at different times are much better than other. You just need to observe when to execute your killing move. All players in the first game will complaint that another player got huge points at a certain point in the game. But since all players will complaint about this, the next time you play the game, every player will try to outdone their opponents in their shinning moment. There is luck in the game but because of this, the game becomes more attractive in this particular case. A gem!!!

I liked how quickly the turns can end when I ended it, not so much when it happened to me. More tactics and less strategy than I personally like, but I see the appeal.

Better than expected. The luck factor prevents it from becoming a classic in my book, but I enjoyed myself during my first play and think that the game is highly replayable. There seems to be some strategy in deciding which route to take, even though it does not appear to be wise to concentrate on purchasing god tiles and ignore movement completely. You will need to do at least a bit of both.

interesting game.  It seems like everyone needs to pay a lot of attention to columns, or one player will run away with the game because of them.  Need to play again for more analysis, though I'm not sure it excited me enough to want to push for doing so.

Three plays in, it's growing on me. Attractive and fun, certainly has a fair degree of luck, but is not random - I think the player who can plan for and indeed manipulate the end of epochs will tend to win.

Another Med-themed civ expansion game done with Euro flare.  Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either.  In other words, a "solid 7" game.

RATING: 6
I'm not a fan of this one.  There are some interesting mechanics, but at the end of the day, it seems like the luck overwhelms good decision making.  

This is not to say that there aren't strategies that you can pursue, it's just that it is better to be lucky and draw money than be unlucky and not draw money, and it is better to get lucky and draw random valuable gods and not get unlucky and draw useless gods.  

I wanted to like it more than I did, but it's a miss for me.

RATING: 7.3
[EDIT 2]: with the correct rules there are no more doubts about the game flow. But now i think the influence of luck is too much. The game in the end seems always quite balanced (2 plrs game) but when bad luck is against you there's not much to do. I also perceive quite a bit of runaway leader problem (more money, more feet, more money, more everything...). i am lowering the rating to 7.3; anyways, it's fast and i play it again quite gladly.

[EDIT 1]: ok, we missed a basic rule: feet come back to the player, NOT to general reserve! I already raised the rating to 7.5 without even playing again! but i confident it will be a full 8!
*************
7 is a temporary rating, waiting to understand some perplexing points about this promising but somehow "wrong" game.

the rhytm is very good, rules aren't very complicated, setup is quite lenghty, there are some different strategies you can try. Ages seem to go by too quickly sometimes and you don't have time to create anything, losing all the feet you placed. Money is unbearably scarce and imossible to come by but most of all if there is a display full of the same uninteresting card (movmement) it is not possible to change them all like in TtR! it seems sooo wrong!

anyways, if i will understand some aspect of the game better i'll be glad to raise this even to an 8

It's lighter than the stuff I usually like to play but I'm glad to have it. I don't like Carc, Settlers, Ticket to Ride or the other usually suggested gateways.

Pantheon has nice variety in strategies, but it's not overwhelming for new players.
It's hard to know who's going to win as the VP's (Gods and Monuments) ramp as the game progresses, so that keeps everyone on their toes. The whole strucure of the game is very random actually - which gods will be available? Which Booty tiles will show up on the board? Which cards will you draw? 
Usually I might not appreciate this, but in this case it helps maintain an even playing field so that even new players have a chance of winning.

4 players is tighter and more stressful, 2 players is looser and has more control. It's fun either way.

another fine game by Bernd Brunnhofer...special powers, money to buy stuff, moving around on a map to get stuff, variable cards, tiles and tokens...not a civ game, but more of a game about exploiting tactical opportunities...luck doesn't drive the game, but you do have to work with several random factors...I quite enjoy the play of this...

After 1 Play: What a disappointment. I love Stone Age and St. Petersburg, but this fell completely flat. There's no core to bind the gameplay together - feels like a bunch of random stuff thrown together. On top of that the pacing is really wonky, with some rounds ending even before everyone has had a turn.

Nothing particularly new in this one, but deciding on which of the 4 actions to use each turn keeps it interesting, and each epoch seemed very different, on some its over within 2 peoples turns , others are much more drawn out. And it does seem to build rapdily to a quick conclusion, with multiple ways to score points. Not outstanding , but a good solid Euro.

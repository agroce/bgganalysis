Precioso juego de miniaturas, de batallas navales con 2 bandos, inglés y francés, heredero del sistema de Wings of glory, que consiste en elegir una carta entre muchas para planificar el movimiento, y luego ponerla delante de la miniatura, moviendo ésta a la marca correspondiente de la carta. Trae 4 barcos y sobretodo éstos y los componentes son espectaculares, si bien he de decir que las 4 cartas que se insertan en las bases, no entraban! Tuve que reducirlas muy cuidadosamente con cutter y ahora perfecto :)
Manual de 60 páginas, que puede asustar, pero el juego tiene varios modos: básico, normal y avanzado. Y además, muchas reglas opcionales extra que puedes elegir para darle más detalles al juego, y muchas imágenes de ejemplo, además de varios escenarios al final, para diferentes disposiciones de la partida. El juego vale su dinero, y si lo encontráis de oferta no lo dudéis. 2 o 4 jugadores es lo ideal. A la espera de extras de barcos españoles!

Juego que recrea el combate entre navios napoleónicos, donde a través de cartas desarollaremos el movimiento de los mismos; de manera similar a XWing, aunque personalmente me quedo con Sails Of Glory.

Primero porque me da sensación mayor de simulación que le de la franquicia de Lucas; si se juega con las reglas avanzadas son varias cosas a tener en cuenta, como fuerza y velocidad del viento, carga de los cañones, las acciones de la tripulación , que se verán reducidas debido a las andanadas del enemigo, etc..

y lo segundo porque ya solo con la caja básica da para mucho, sin tener que comprar mas naves, cosa que creo que no sucede con xwing.

RATING: 7.5
Visually very appealing thanks to its miniatures, this game takes advantage of it's hex-free movement to offer lots of subtleties in manoeuvre and variations between ships. Scenarios are more free-form (perhaps more in the miniature war-game rather than board war-game tradition) although the ships themselves are firmly historically based. Different from my other Age of Sail games, I'm not totally hooked and won't collect the whole range, but a good game to have in the collection.

After four plays, I'm not sure this quite gels with me, for reasons I can't quite put my finger on. Looks great though, and I'll keep if for no other reason than my son might be interested when he's older.

I have: (Starter Set)
Courageuse 1778 / Unite 1787 (32 frigate)
Genereux 1785 / Aquilon 1789 (74 SOTL)
HMS Terpsichore 1785 / HMS Meleager 1785 (32 frigate)
HMS Defence 1763 / HMS Vanguard 1787 (74 SOTL)
(and extras)

Stumbled across this game and couldn't believe my eyes. It looks beautiful on the table. As a Patrick O'Brien fan I have enjoyed this immensely. Great, customizable rule set and solid rule book. Fun to design your own scenarios. 

I truly love all the components for this game. It's just too bad I couldn't get it to the table very often. In fact, I decided to sell it and quite a few accessories due to lack of opponents. But if you love age of sail, miniatures gaming, and have opponents then I highly recommend this game!

Initial Impression: Ares did an amazing job with this game. The models are wonderfully produced, if a little delicate. The advanced rules add numerous tough decisions and thematic chrome to the game. I highly recommend them and would never play without them. The effects of wind are a stroke of genius, as they add a dash of randomness to course plotting. Controlling multiple ships was a bit overwhelming for me and I think I would prefer multi-ship engagements only with multiple players but the ship log helps with the bookkeeping.This is a game I would like to explore more.

Belles figurines, beaux composants, proposition attrayante... mais les règles sont mal foutues, il y a des mécanismes inutiles, on aurait pu simplifier ou rendre plus agréable à jouer, la manipulation des logs et le fait que chaque navire a son deck de cartes unique rend difficile le contrôle de plus d'un navire par joueur.

Ça aurait dû être du plaisir facile mais c'était comme du travail.

En plus, côté historicité, on repassera.

With such an interesting theme, it is startling how "Sails of Glory" manages to fail through sheer clunkiness.  There are more elegant or realistic board games and miniatures rules that date from the 1970s.  By making every aspect of the game as fiddly as possible, eurogamers, wargamers, and miniatures players will be equally dissatisfied.  This is sad because the ship models are lovely and potentially, the game could have really been something if only some streamlining work were done on it.  As it stands, it is a stark, expensive reminder that beauty is only skin deep.

Sails of glory could be a really good miniatures game. The one big problem of the game is the missing army building. There is no point cost allocation. Apart from this its good. Although I prefer Wings of War/Glory Second World War. This game adds to much mechanisms on a simple miniature combat system.

Great miniatures game for the simulationist. The story is basically what you make it. Just want to blow each other up? Great. Want to research specific ship stats and battles from a certain time and refight it? You can do that too.

This is basically an age of sail miniatures wargame and is fairly well done. You can tone the complexity down for quicker and simple battles between a few ships or you can crank the complexity up by using ALL the mechanics with entire fleet on fleet battles.

The models are also potentially useful as a standalone product. If you have a need for tall ships in any game you're running, these pre-painted ships might fit the bill nicely.

My favorite of the "template movement" style games. Wind adds an extremely enjoyable factor. Broadsides feel deadly and readily available with forgiving arcs, and the token draw for damage is interesting. Gameplay is wonderfully paced and the game looks great all setup.

RATING: 7
For several players each commanding a single ship, this is a great introduction into and pastime with Age of Sail miniatures gaming. It's scalable both in the number of players and with the experience of the group (to play with more advanced rules). However, even an experienced player will have their hands full with managing two ships. I think only the hardest of hard-core will be able to swing a squadron of three or four ships, so it's utility as a fleet-action game is probably limited. But for frigate duels or squadron-vs-squadron, it's grand!

I've been waiting for this game for all my gaming career. From "Broadsides" through "Wooden Ships & Iron Men"; to "Close Action" and "Serpents of the Seas" - they're all great games but this one's the better. Of course we've only played three single ship frigate actions but I'm confident that my rating will hold up over the long run.

After a few plays, my impressions of the game have risen.

Couple things: the "Enemy in Sight" meeting engagement is fine as a learning scenario, but not great and it doesn't scale beyond about 4 ships without some more space - it just gets too crowded and the collision rules aren't great if there is congestion.

We moved on to the Force the Blockade scenario and it seemed fine, although hard on the British.

I think the sweet spot in terms of rules is to do Advanced plus cherry-pick a few high-impact optionals; I think Aiming High and the wind change rules are both easy and make the game more interesting. Double Shot is also easy and fun. The grappling and boarding rules aren't great, and are hard to use in this system anyway, so probably easy to skip.

Sails of Glory has taken some heat in some quarters for being quite unrealistic, and it is on a number of levels. However, the problem from a game design perspective is that most Age of Sail battles were pretty uninteresting - just line up and blast each other indecisively - because command & control presented such serious problems and it was so hard to do real damage at range with the weaponry available. Sails of Glory has taken some significant historical liberties in service of making an interesting game that, while not faithful in a lot of details, is still broadly historically evocative. Works for me.
---
Nice. My sole complaint about the game are the rules for overlap/collisions, which are very confusing and can lead to unintuitive results, especially when there are more than two ships involved. Otherwise, though, there is a lot to like here - all the tropes of the Age of Sail are captured, from chain and grapeshot to boarding actions, grappling, leaks, etc. The miniatures and other components are terrific and the game plays cleanly and quickly.

As usual, I wish Ares provided better scenarios and some point values for ships - it's really hard to know what's going to be a fair matchup other than just matching SoL for SoL and Frigate for Frigate (SoL's will beat the crap out of Frigates 1 on 1). Not terrible, but should be better. Some ships are better than others and it would be nice to know. The scenarios in the book aren't terrible but are pretty generic.

This game suffers from an overabundance of counters, cards and fiddly bits needed to control each ship. This limits the number of ships you can play with at one time, which will hurt sales of additional ships in the future.

If you're going to make lots of ships for people to buy, make a game where you can play with lots of ships!

Good adaptation of the Wings of Glory system to naval combat. In some ways you could argue that this game is more realistic than [i]Close Action[/i] since it uses gradual turns instead of overly-precise and too-coarse sixty degree turns.

The game is simpler than [i]Close Action[/i], but not by much once you add the advanced rules. It's definitely got some chrome, too. The stuff you record with pencil and paper in similar games is recorded with chits and a board instead.

The combat and damage is a bit coarse, and ships are somewhat brittle with critical hits coming up a bit more often than they should. But, it works within the design of the game, and is simple in execution.

Anyway, good design that accomplished what it set out to and looks good to boot. Thumbs up.

Less inviting than Wings of Glory, but may end up being the better system. If I can ever get it to the table...

Edit: Finally got to play! It was really cool. There’s no more luck in it than in Wings, but because it’s longer and more complex the luck seems more out of place for my taste. I look forward to playing it again though.

Loved this game,  it is a great simple-strategy take on the Age of Sail, as close as I have found to Wooden Ships & Iron Men.   Takes a lot to set up and tons of storage space required.  Very expensive to build a respectable fleet.   Caveat: game not designed to accommodate respectable fleets.

Only played using the basic rules and they are just that, very very basic. As an introduction to the core mechanics it was ok but rather long and drawn out.

The damage mechanic is really nice with all damage is  essentially face up until a threshold is reached when it turns face down and the capabilities of the ship are decreased.

Unfortunately the movement mechanic which is a major part of the game is needlessly complex and actually quite fiddly, especially when Star wars X wing has simplified and streamlined this type of hidden movement.

Fun gameplay, but surprisingly fiddly. Large actions playable, but only with multiple players per side. Rules are a little loose and (IMO) would benefit from a well defined sequence of play and ditching the Basic/Standard/Advanced/Optional format. How is Boarding an optional rule?! Minis are superb and the game looks great on the table. Can't wait for other nationalities and ship classes.

This game has many elements that appeal to me.  Collectability, pre-paints for ease of getting into the game, a bit of variety per model as each can represent a choice of two ships, though some are identical and only differ by name.
I like the pre-programmed movement, tracking things by counters and chit-pull damage.  Lots of variety with the advanced rules and optional rules, which I call "the fun rules" and "the cool rules".  I do appreciate the basic and standard rules as something that can be used to introduce novice and younger players.

UPDATE:  I have now tried many different ways to play this (basic, advanced, advanced + optional, house rules...) and there really is just no reason to play this instead of Close Action, or any other of the decent age of sail games out there.  The different rule sets are combinations of fiddly, more fiddly, and extra fiddly, and I think the realism actually degrades with the more rules that are added.

Latest issue #1 - there is no turn-in-place, so if you get too close to another ship, obstacle, or map edge you can't move, possibly for the rest of the game.

Latest issue #2 - the maneuver system, while theoretically an advantage over hexes due to more resolution, simply becomes random because of the inability to accurately judge exactly what your angle to the wind will be two moves out.  it completely falls apart when ships start overlapping each other!

Latest issue #3 - the ease of tacking in SoG, combined with the ability to fire both broadsides at the same time, makes actual tactics like holding the wind gauge and doubling a line pointless.  charge into the middle of the scrum and keep firing!

Latest issue #4 - selecting a mix of chits to order and arrange is a totally anti-climatic battle result.  you can't even look at a set of chits and know whether it is good or bad because of the way they are arranged - high numbers could end up being mostly unused.  compare this to the immediate satisfaction of rolling a "6" in Close Action, or getting all hits (or all evades) in X-Wing.

Finally done playing this game.  Not with the minis for sure, but the ruleset is just not worth the time.

Disputing the ability of a SoL to simultaneously keep loading and firing both broadsides ref: Shipboard Life and Organisation 1731-1815, NRS vol 178 (1998), ed. B. Lavery. pg 274.  The ships were only manned with enough crew to fully man one broadside of guns.  While the crews could be split to man both sides, the effectiveness of each side would drop.  When they were split, they were sequenced so one would be loading while the other was firing.

House rules (possibly rated 4-5):  no planning, use advanced tacking rules, no special damage, no crew actions, only one broadside may fire per turn, use raking, ships may speed up or slow down one step per turn, no collision damage (even with friendly ships), no other advanced or optional rules.
--------------------------------------------------------

Sails of Glory is turning into quite the disappointment.  I don't regret Kickstarting it or purchasing it so much, because I will use the models for Close Action, but as a game my enjoyment of SoG keeps going down each time I play it.

As any kind of simulation of the topic, it is very poor.  Each ship will generally be trashed in 2-3 hits, so this concentrates all of the action into 1 or 2 maneuvers and SoLs simply were not destroyed in such a short period of time.  As a game, I guess this makes it fast, but to have a triple-deck SoL destroyed by two 'normal' shots (not rakes, not initial broadsides) kills any enjoyment I might get from the game.

The crux of it is that I can have my club play a full game of Close Action with good simulation value in 3 hours, with 20 minutes of explanation.  SoG takes maybe an hour less for the same battle for 15 minutes of explanation, but with essentially random outcomes based on the SoG mechanics, rather than any input from the players.

Some specific examples:

-A three-deck SoL strikes from undamaged with 1 6-chit B broadside and 1 6-chit A broadside.  Two rudder hits and two broken masts did the deal.  The 'special hits' completely drive the results, much more than the maneuvering of your ship for better shots.  I would say that every single broadside results in a 'special hit' of some kind - contrast this with Close Action that has a critical hit chance that is less than 1 in 6.  Since normal shooting is so deadly, why would you ever mess around with chain shot, grape shot, or double shot and risk the chance to not being able to fire?

-To resolve damage, you fish chits out of 5 different bags, then flip the chits over, than sort the chits, then place the chits on various boxes on the ship displays while replacing some the chits with other chits.  Close Action = roll 1 die, mark off boxes.  Handling the flooding, fires, and other damage is a complete pain-in-the-ass with the crew action chits since actions take two turns to resolve and this is handled in a completely fiddly way.  And, by the way, since almost every time you get hit you get some fire, flood, broken mast, etc. you will probably die before you get it fixed anyway.

-Maneuvering with the cards seems like it would be easier than the rules you must learn to plot moves in Close Action.  This ease falls apart in practice as it is difficult to handle the decks of more than one ship and the results of collisions and close maneuvering are horrible to deal with.

What does kind of work with SoG is a something like a 2v2 frigate battle, which would not be so great in Close Action.  That is cool and nice-to-have, but it makes 50% of the core game and 90% of the expansions useless, doesn't it?

Another not minor problem - I can easily fit a 6v6 SoL game of Close Action on my 4'x8' gaming table using 1/900 miniatures.  I can't fit a 6v6 SoG battle on the same table because you then also need room to lay out 12 ship cards.  Oh, those dreaded log sheets that just make everything so horrible!

RATING: 9
What a fantastic game!  I have liked this type of system for a while, but each version still had just a bit lacking for me.  Wings of War lead to Xwing for me, which was fun but was superseded by Star Trek Attack Wing, because I preferred the feel of larger ships and having a crew.  Sails of glory takes that whole part and runs with it.  Playing the advanced game, you absolutely get the feel of captaining a huge sailing ship, shouting orders to your men while trying to line up your next shot.  Once you start taking damage, you quickly find that you may not have enough orders to go around.  More than just the movement system, which works great here, the whole resource management part of the game shines.

Different enough from the other titles using the same core mechanics. It's fun and has lots of add this and that rules to suit your needs. Slower than x-wing and less maneuverable than wings of glory. But suits the era perfectly. We had a blast with only half the rules in play. It's the most involved of them all but still very good.
Nice to play my friends copy, as collecting all the different themed versions of the games would be too much! I am happy with my D&D attack wing. One of us collects the WoG and x-wing also, so we have them all covered. But will jump at the chance to play any of these type of games anytime. Well maybe not Star Trek! None of us have any urge to buy or play that one, shit theme and worst models.

Smooth and fast. Lots of action.  You feel nervous and you get a line on the enemy. BUT WAIT! Is the the best time to shoot your load? Maybe wait one more turn and he might show you his ass to your broadside! Hard to hold fire when under fire.

Great game.

I like this much better than the lighter x-wing system. More strategic, lot's of tactical choices, less dependant on dice rolls & perfect eye-measurement skills.

The historic theme i can invest deeper into too..

There is pretty steep learning curve if you play with the advanced rules, i suggest playing with only one ship per player!
Just to get the feel of how ships move with ever changing weather, you might wanna run a simple non-violent race track.

Definitely scratched that Age of Sail itch that I was looking for. The aesthetically-pleasing miniatures are nice but the capture of fighting a ship-to-ship battle, with the varied consequences that can ensue was what really drew me into the world. Too bad I don't want to invest the time, effort and money into it (not to mention other people to join in) otherwise this would definitely be added to my collection.

UPDATE: I literally have forgotten all about this game (until the moment I wrote this), so my rating has dropped as a result.

No idea why really, but I adore this game. This is one of the best large-group games I've found yet (as all turn phases happen simultaneously for both sides, no down time!). I love the theme, the art, component quality. The rulebook seem intimidating, but it's really easy to get the hang of it as they're tiered (honestly we just play with the basic rules, making it a very beer&pretzel experience), meaning you start with the basic rules and each section gives a few more until you're ready for the advanced+optional rules which make it very different.
I'd love to play a really big lots of ships, all-the-rules game with someone.

Picked up the game via Kickstarter, and I have to say We are enjoying it very much. It straddles the line between "beer and chips game" and naval simulation pretty well.  The optional rules give you the ability to add complexity as your game group desires. 

Just sitting down with another player and seeing who can best the other as a captain of a vessel is a lot of fun, but when you play a scenario with a little story the game really shines. 

I'm just waiting for some new ships to expand the possibilities, but I'm already hooked. 

I highly recommend the game to anyone who enjoys the setting.

I was hoping that this game would provide pretty accurate naval fights with easy to digest system. Unfortunately it seems that tactics are not very realistic and simulation is absent. Eg. it is not that much different whether you are sailing directly into wind or you are sailing with best wind. Difference is at best few centimeters on card. So if one player makes mistake to sail into bad position the other one usually cannot punish him, because he is not able to maneuver around him efficiently enough.

Also difference between big and small ships is not so big as it should be.

So I will have to return to Close Actions :-). Which are not easy to play but both narrative and historical accurateness is in completely different league.

Pretty fun game of fighting during the age of sail.  Two versions, basic and advanced.  Basic is certainly faster and cleaner.  Advanced adds some nice chrome, but unsure if the added time is worth it, although without there is very little realism felt.  I can see how people would want more ships and scenarios, but I had no idea such additional items would be so outraeously expensive.  It certainly prevents me in getting into buying the system.  I might have been more interested in acquiring the game if they got rid of the pretty but ultimately useless little plastic ships.  Anyway, had great fun playing and glad my buddies have a copy.

Really impressed, all the right details are here; from my point of view, only the advanced rules are really worth playing, but it's good that there are also intros for the landlubbers.

Problem, problem, big problem (for me): the price. I get that there are minis, nicely (not exceptionally) done and painted, but for a medium-sized engament (nothing big like 1st June, but let's say, Cape Henry, with 8 vs 8) it'll require over (way over) 200 EUR.

Seems to be just the right balance between tactical realism and simplicity with the advanced rules. 

You really do feel like a Captain having to plan two turns in advance with your orders and loading the batteries. You also have a very meaningful sailing duel in order to get in superior position. Fight fires, repair leaks, pump water, prepare boarding parties, load grapeshot, adjust your sails...sometimes your crew doesn't hear an order and it doesn't get carried out. Really great action. The miniatures are awesome.

I don't usually give out a 10 but this game is worthy of that score.

It is simple yet detailed and has deep strategy.  Of course, you have to like this era, but if you do, this is well done.  Flying colors by GMT is similar but much deeper but overall, this game has most of what is in Flying Colors without the detail rule book.  Sails of Glory has a very simple mechanism for movement and firing, yet covers just about everything from boarding to broadsides.  

Plus the ships look way cool.

This game does a lot of things nicely and slightly differently than similar games. At first I didnt know how I would feel about pulling bits from bags for damage but after a few plays I think it fits this game perfectly and I am a convert.

Thankful that a game like this got made since I know its a bit of a niche theme.

Good game. The combat system and the crew actions are well done. With damage to ship and crew gradually limiting your own attack and maneuverability, the system makes a nice narrative. That said, I am not a fan of the movement system; the ships cards can be a little fiddly.

The minis are top notch and can be used with any number of similar games. Some quick inserts, and they're perfect for WSIM or Flying Colors.

Sails of Glory – Miniatures Game Preview
By Rick Martin 

Sails of Glory. Miniatures Game Preview. Publisher: Ares Games Designer: Andrea Angiolino and Andrea Mainini

Sails of Glory is Ares Games’ new line of miniature combat rules that cover the Age of Sail. This first set will feature ships from the Napoleonic wars and includes vessels from the mid- to late-1700s. 
 
Sails of Glory utilizes an adaption of Ares Games’ award-winning card-based movement system that is featured in their Wings of Glory World War I and II aerial combat games. Each ship will feature a control card as well as a fully painted 1:1000 scale miniature. The first four ships in the starter set are the Courageuse (1788), HMS Defence (1763), Genereux (1785) and the HMS Tersichore (1785).

Each vessel is rated for hull points based upon the ship’s size, known as its “Burden”; its maneuverability, known as its “Veer”; its crew size; and its number of cannons and their respective firing arcs. Each ship’s data card also includes indicators for damage accumulated (and how that damage affects both the crew casualties and the number of guns that can fire), cannon loaded/unloaded status, number of sails raised (for speed) and whether the ship is at anchor or not.

There are colored counters (chits) that are drawn randomly to determine damage results from combat, similar to the damage counters used in the Wings of Glory aerial combat games. Damage shown on the counters goes from 0 (a total miss) to hull point damage, sail damage, crew hits and the dreaded fire counter! Counters are also provided to keep track of wind (very important to ships that used sails), types of ammunition loaded in the cannons, and other various and sundry things, for instance, there is an interesting-looking counter featuring “RUM.” 

 The types of ammunition for the cannons include solid shot for damaging a ship’s hull, chain shot for taking out sails, and canister shot for killing crew (think of giant shotgun shells—very nasty indeed).

Each game turn is divided into the following phases: Planning, Movement, Combat and Reloading.

The Planning Phase starts with the players determining what direction the wind is blowing, which affects not only the speed of the ship but the possible maneuvers it can perform. Based upon this information, the players pick the maneuver card that they will use and turn it face down in front of them. In the basic game, one maneuver card is played; in the intermediate game, two are picked.

During the Movement Phase, the previously selected maneuver card is placed in front of the ship; the ship is then moved so that the arrow on the back of its base lines up with an arrow on the movement card. This is very similar to the Wings of Glory movement system, but in Ships of Glory the number of sails a ship has will affect its speed and which movement arrow to use for maneuvers.  

The Combat Phase happens when opposing ships are close enough to fire their cannons. The range is measured using a range ruler much like the type used in Wings of Glory. Proper maneuvering of your ship will bring most or all of your guns to bear on the target while leaving the target unable to respond with its own broadside. A lucky or skilled captain may even be able to “cross the enemy’s T,” i.e., place a ship perpendicular to the enemy’s bow or stern. After guns are fired, the target player randomly draws damage chits and damage is assigned. If the ships are close enough, their crew may be able to fire their muskets at the other ship’s crew; different damage chits are drawn for damage from muskets rather than cannon. Boarding-party actions are also included.

In the Reloading Phase, a ship’s guns that fired on the previous turn may be reloaded for action next turn. Since you are usually working one turn ahead, you have to plan your shots well in this game, both in terms of your planned maneuvers and the type of ammunition that will be most effective if the maneuvers put you into firing position.

The game plays very well and is a blast! We played a four-ship slugfest in about 2 ½ hours and the players rated the game very highly. Sails of Glory is sure to please even the most ardent landlubber.

I find this to be the most interesting adaption of the game system originally used in the Wings of Glory series (later expanded into the X-Wing and Star Trek universe) that has now produced a good thematic experience which is sufficiently deep in strategy and most importantly fun game based on Napoleonic era Ship-to-Ship tactical combat. 

Fantastic components with game play that is fast and elegantly with the right balance between rules and ease of play.

Bad problem of the game developing into bumper boats on e the map gets crowded in a place.

[color=#CC0000]

Rating based on one play only, so take with a grain of salt.  But -- this is coming from a die-hard Wings of Glory fan and avid chit pusher.

Overall I think this is a fine game, but I'll be honest, there's parts that felt very clunky.  

The movement mechanic needs a bit of tuning but is fundamentally sound.  It's descended from the [b]Dawn of World War II[/b] side of Wings of Glory and elicits the same heads-down sort of feel as DoWWII does, as opposed to the WWI version's more chatty, social nature.  I prefer the original, but given this game's prospects for a deeper play the choice makes sense.  

When ships occupy the same space odd things happen that don't make a lot of sense.  I appreciate sometimes you get snookered, but in close quarters the adjusted movement seems to make no sense.  You start considering rules instead of reality, and my concern is that people will start using these exceptional cases as their favored part of the game.  Odd rules.  I think movement is mostly there, but not as good as it could be in this one aspect.  House rules will likely fix this.

The chits are . . . well, clunky.  The way they're placed onto the console for your ship isn't very friendly and is prone to a bump screwing up your status (especially with the way the consoles are designed, more on that in a minute).  Honestly, throw the drawn chits in a discard pile and mark the position on the damage tracks with a single chit each.  Done.  Fix two complete.

Chit pull is OK. (The bags are very pretty; get Dixie Cups.)  But pulling six and seven at a time and only having the damage on one side is a hassle.  Print on both sides so you can throw them down and see what happened in a flash.  More dramatic, more exciting, easier to do, speeds up play.  A minor thing that could be made to work better with a simple change.  (An aside -- the only reason to print information on only one side of a chit is if it's going to be stacked next to the board and requires a blind pull.  The chits in Sails of Glory are too small and too numerous for this to be a consideration let alone a preference, so printing on only one side is just a non-starter.  Mark the different chit categories via colors, or borders, or a small letter in the corner, or size or shape, etc.  Then print damage value on both sides.)

The consoles -- unforced design error.  Stop making consoles with cutouts!  They suck in Wings of Glory too!  They warp faster and warp more, and then they want to spin when you work with them or even bump them (or the table).  In this case it's worse than most because you have other console pieces inserted in a hole in the middle of the main console that have chits piled on them, so the spin can screw up your record keeping.  The base console should have been a solid square piece of cardboard that you lay pieces on top of like the original Wings of War (i.e., if it spins [u]everything[/u] spins and nothing gets bumped).  Instead, it's a gee-whiz ooh-pretty! board with nifty snap in pieces that isn't effective and can bugger your game information.  It makes people buy (pretty!) but it doesn't work as well.  Simple would have been better.  (Simple is virtually always better).  Make a pdf available please so people can print the base console a to a piece of paper instead.  Fix #3 complete.

We were already redesigning the information record-keeping on our first play.  The "spare" crew counters to replace broadside crew damage is contrived and unnecessary -- just move a single counter down the crew line.  Throw used chits in a discard cup instead of piling and stacking them on the console.  A die on the ship's damage track would show position and amount of damage simultaneously.  This game would run twice as fast with a traditional log sheet.  But I know -- it would kill sales because people want pretty-pretty, and slicky-slicky, and no pencils, and super thick cardboard counters in earthy shades of brown and red with stately-but-cartoony art on it with lots of "icons".  But it would be much simpler and more manageable with a log sheet, and you would never have to worry about bumping your chit-laden four-piece ship console with your shirt sleeve as you lean over the table working your maneuver in close quarters with other ships.  

Leave it as is.  Serious players will replace all of the clutter on their own.  We simplified the console on our learning game about four turns in, so this will happen on its own.  (None of my friends use the consoles in Wings of Glory either, so I suppose this is inevitable.  It's a simpler game but I think the premise still holds.)

I think there's a good core game here so I'm interested in playing again to find it.  But my cunning plan is to have a pre-printed console sheet and a pencil handy instead of the cardboard version, and if I'm calling the tune a rules revision as well for how movement handles ships trying to occupy the same space.  I've written a lot and sound like a whiner boy but all of what I wrote above boils down to nickel and dime issues in version 1.0 of the product.  Players can correct most of it on their own as they become comfortable with the game and assuredly will.  What remains is to discover the game play itself over several sessions, and with any luck I'll get the opportunity to do that.


Oh, one last thing.  Would it have killed Ares to use a slot post or two posts under the ships to keep them from spinning on their bases?  I was discussing WofG Peg Glue with the owner of the copy I was playing even before we started.  His ship held itself in place, mine spun whenever I moved it.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  Wings of War comes to the Age of Sail!

RATING: 7.5
Bought the Captain's Set on Kickstarter.  Very happy with models and accessories.  Marvellous game.  I think it gives a great feel for the Age of Fighting Sail in a relatively clean and speedy fashion.  The only drawback is that it is very difficult to control more than two ships when playing at the advanced level.

Certainly, the quality of the miniatures are quite high although expensive to collect them in any quantity.   Regarding the rules system, my only quibble is that the range rules seems too short in all scales by at least 50%.  The range of a 24-pound cannon firing round shot in the late 18-century was 1,000 - 1,200 yards.   In this game, the ships get closer to each other than they did in the real world before they start to take their shots.   Of course, this means a larger gaming surface is required, along with a longer range ruler, both relatively simple fixes.

I have only played solo a few times to get a grasp of the rules.  This is a great looking game and I'm really liking how it captures the age of sail era so well.  The movement mechanics really suit the age of sail far more than fast moving aircraft (WoG), and space ships (xwing).  Ship management is engaging and the battles are tense once the ships get to grips.  Maneuvering ships is not easy but it adds to the thematics of the whole package.  Outstanding components, mechanics that shine, tension and theme.  :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :nostar:

Best light naval combat out there

RATING: 7
Clever naval combat game roughly derived from the Wings of War system, which is to say, miniature ships swan around an open playing field, their movement (speed, turning circles) constrained by a rough model of inertia. 

I have no particular interest in either boats or planes but the system feels a much better fit here as there is no need to model altitude. There are a lot of lovely thematic touches for flavour, with advanced rules including elements like boarding parties and different types of shot to do different types of damage.

Ultimately not the sort of game I'm interested in pursuing but enjoyable, especially as a team exercise.

There are no national characteristics in the rules.  The British and French are just as good as each other, with maybe the French ships being able to take a little more damage.

My initial rating is based on the beginner rules where the game clearly is not at its best. Using at least some of the standard rules seems pretty much essential to deliver a fun experience.

This adds a lot of potential rules overhead (and clearly, tactical depth) to Wings of Glory, but I'm not sure that I need the extra depth since we tend to use WoG as a pick up and play rough and dirty dog fight. The ships are very pretty but there are so many chits of different colours scattered everywhere. Whilst war gamers are probably fine with this, to my Eurogamer eyes it's a fiddly, bloody mess.

To be rated fully once I've used the full rules (wind changes, choice of cannon fire, grappling and possibly orders and sail changes).

Played this as a participation game at Hammerhead 2015 and despite messing up my direction of turn on several occasions I enjoyed this. So many good games, so little time, too many calls upon my pennies. And I took the bait....

Nice game because of the basic, standard & advanced rules. It can be as light, medium or even heavy play weight (advanced + optional rules with large fleet). 
I find it a quite tense games as I try to outfox my opponent.

Fun! And tense. A definite improvement on the Wings of War system. The delayed (programed) action system of the standard rules makes for a harrowing, but exciting experience. It also manages to capture a historical feel without getting bogged down in tedious rules and charts. Looking forward to playing again.

While idea of this game is very good in all it's simplicity, it is fundamentally flawed. Many other games fail differently, usually by adding too much tedious details to what in reality is relatively simple matter. 

Trouble is that ships appear to be armed with weapons of completely different century. Fine if one finds it entertaining, but extremely cheapskate design choice that cannot be simply repaired (among other matters in the sailing model itself). Simplest way, of course is to design a new game in solid basics, or pick one that already is. 

More thought on what needs to be presented, less "let's do it easiest way" could have helped. 

On a plus side, one can easily expand to other eras. Waiting for Dreadnoughts or something similar to pop up.

Bought because I wanted a Napoleonic wars naval game that wasn't a dry as dust GMT hex and counter affair.

Not yet played, currently overshadowed by X-Wing.

Update - I have various complaints about this game, which I will elaborate on later.

(After 1 2p game)  Wings of War on the seas it is.  However, it has some nicely thought out bases, wind direction, different movement vectors based on sails, etc.

I am not a huge miniatures guy, but found this one to be pretty good and would play again if in the mood.

A top notch evolution of the mechanics from Wings of War ported over to the age of sail.  And top notch quality figures with great paint jobs as well.  I can see this one becoming a money pit for me and a cash cow for Ares.

This is wings of glory set in the age of sail - well, more or less. The rules are very flexible, offering different layers of complexity which allows for an easy quick start, the models are beautiful (and prepainted!) and the overall production quality is unbelievable. Yes, it is pricey (but so are X-Wing or Attack Wing), but if you have an even slight interest in the age of sail, definitely try this game.

Maritime Naval Warfare between Sailing ships. It is based on the Wings of War battle system but it plays and feels differently. Simultaneous maneuvering is managed with cards instead of dials. Three modes of difficulty goes as hard as you can go with true wind, tacking angles, changing sails, crew assignments, different ordinance and cannon loading procedure, and specific hit damage system. They do a great job of capturing the essence of sea battles under sail. Be prepared for a lot of special rules. Or, dial down to easy attack-wing mode and move and fire. Don't go into irons.

Definitely the best implementation of the 'Wings of War' card-driven-movement system (which never felt right for aircraft).  It feels a LOT better when used with ships, and the way wind is incorporated into the game is amazing.  While it's generally considered more game than simulation, I think it actually feels a bit closer to expected results than even WS&IM.

Tentative rating based on a small, incomplete game.  The minis look really nice.  Movement seemed unnecessarily fiddly - do I really need all those cards for often slight variations of angle.  Damage also seemed to involve more steps than it probably needed for how it works.

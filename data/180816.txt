I am a sucker for this stop-motion film, it's one of my favorite flicks of all time, a unique fairy tale, and the thought of a Munchkin game was pretty interesting. And, strangely enough, it works...not quite as cool as the Adventure Time version, but the mechanics do work within this theme, and I like how you have the different civilian 'towns' to grant your individual abilities instead of character classes in core Munchkin. Equip, draw, mess with your friends, it's not a whole lot different, so if you already hate this game then Nightmare is unlikely to change that. But it's a good looking, fun 'take that' card game provided your session doesn't run too long. Best with other fans.

nicely designed! makes me wanna play munchkin even though it feels this game is very long with less fun then others who take the same time. would love to try it out sometime with the basic game.

I like Munchkin and Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas so this was a no-brainer. It is a fairly representational version of Munchkin, if a bit more back-bitey than some. The artwork is beautiful too. Strongly recommend it.

-Pumpkin King (promo card)

Any fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas MUST own this game!!! The art on the cards is amazing, the included die is perfect and overall this version of Munchkin is an absolute HIT! 

Fun and easy game to teach, learn and play, this one, while new, is a favorite already.

Favorite Munchkin so far, the additional stuff, like citizenship and vehicles take Munchkin to the next level.

My "Take That"-loving game group demands a variant of Munchkin almost every time we get together; it is one of their favorite humorous, back-stabbing, confrontational family of games.

What a fantastic little custom dice - that alone is almost worth the price of entry. The Munchkin formula is made a little more random (which I like very much) with variable powers determined through rolls, and the theming makes this a hit with my wife. If any game can convince me to try out the series again, this is it!

A pretty decent transfer of Nightmare Before Christmas into the Munchkin style. The die that comes with it looks very cool but is hard to read. The cards can also be a tad bit tough to interpret at times.

It's ok - the theme doesn't do much for me so I would prefer to play other versions.

Just bought this after getting to play it. I like munchkin and I think this is a good expansion on the game. I also like nightmare before Christmas so it was inevitable that I would get this!

RATING: 6
Humours still there, but a significant deal less challenging than munchkin adventure time.

More plays (2 played now) confirm that its just too easy. Getting to ten points & winning is so quick, the games over before people can start catching up to an initial leader. 

Poops.

Not bad version of Munchkin for beginners, and fans of NMBC.  I like the icons that designate hand, foot, head, armor.  Lacking in the typical Munchkinesque sarcasm, and art style is more like the movie than Munchkin.

Charming illustrations by Kovalik and amusing tongue-in-cheek humor, but the game ceased to be enjoyable once I discovered Euro games which made me more critical of how I spent my leisure time.

Adds vehicles and Citizenships. Great for fans of Munchkin and fans on NBC. Good way to introduce Munchkin to those NBC fans.

Not exactly what I was expecting. It's a bit more complicated than the other Munchkin games that I had the pleasure of bringing to the table. Will need some additional plays to figure out my final rating.

Boosted .75 over the original because of the success of the TNBC theme. Actually well thought out, versus just sloppy re-branding.

Components are cool and as far as mucnhkin sets goes, I think this will be my last one unless they make a Star Wars or LoTR themed version.

Juego de cartas para 2 jugadores, versus de una facción contra otra (hay 3 cajas en total, ésta y 2 más, habiendo hasta ahora 6 facciones en total).
Sencillísimo de aprender a jugar y con más miga de lo que parece, es un juego completamente táctico más que estratégico, con un azar también alto teniendo en cuenta las cartas que te van saliendo. 
Me encanta el formato mini reducido, ocupando justo el espacio necesario, junto con un tablero doblado en papel en la caja, que no es imprescindible para jugar (es más, recomiendan jugarlo también sin tablero, puesto se concibió así), pero el apoyarte en los bordes del mismo también tiene su punto táctico. 
Las diferentes unidades crean ciertas posibilidades tácticas, y le dan un buen punto al juego.
El objetivo es ser el primero en destruir 20 unidades contrarias, o 4 de sus unidades más importantes.
Expansión con factores de terreno y clima. 

Estas dos facciones las veo más poderosas que las otras, y además, los templarios, todavía más que los muertos vivientes, con sólo una partida y analizando las puntuaciones de cartas creemos que los templarios están muy descompensados, tienen demasiada vida y también bastante daño de ataque, y alguna cosa especial extra.

This is essentially a trick taking disguised as a war themed card game. Imagine that you play a card saying "4" on it. Your enemy plays a "5" and wins. To beat his five you play two threes, and so the game progresses until one of you has taken enough tricks to win the game.

The meat of the game is in choosing which battles to engage because you do not have to fight for every trick. Instead, cards are played on a battlefield and you only fight the cards next to yours. In addition there are certain cards that allow for ranged combat.

But this does not save the game. Now it is just repetitive and boring. I guess Lords of War could have been better if players had some other goal than just taking tricks, or playing required e.g. more careful use of cards. Now you just play the one that beats the enemy and that is it.

A very different game play as compared to the orcs and dwarfs. 

Clearly the Templars are stronger in defence and the undead depends lots on archery and close line battle. It's interesting twist to the original set. There may be a balance issue if the factions are played against each other. 

The draw of cards for the undead will decide if this faction will be the weakest among the others. 

Let new players or 'weaker' gamers play with the Templars. Their defence is high for nearly half their deck. Making it near impossible to have single action kills. Maintaining a 1-1 exchange will almost always will you the game. 

Good basic confrontational card game.

Good filler game.  Quick, card based combat, very easy to learn but has a reasonable depth of strategy with the different soldier types.

Great two player fantasy battle game. Well written rules, pick it up in minutes, reliably lasts 30-45 minutes. Just the right mix of luck and skill to make a win feel great, but a loss not crushing. Pick it up!

Replace Zombie Halberd with Shink Dartspitter
Replace Zombie Shambler with Goblin Shanker & Goblin Spikeman
Replace one Command unit (most likely Oozol the Putrid) with Huahua S'tonk
Replace 2 Regular with Orc Deathbringer

Lizardmen replace Leatherback with something else or just maintain having two of them.

My first KS backed game! A quick cardgame for 2 players. Each player plays with his own deck (Templars or the Undead). 

Goal of the game is to  be the first player to have taken (killed) at least 20 general cards of your opponent or to have killed 4 of your opponent's commanders (which have the strongest value in the game). The came can be really strategic though the random factor in the game (you have six card on hand, which are picked blind) can be a little bit frustrating. But the random factor doesn't kill the game.


The artwork is absolutely fantastic.

Lords of war got a whole lot better with this expansion. Recommended!

In Lords of War, two (typically; more is possible but doesn't seem desirable to me) armies face off on an unnamed battlefield, trying to bash each other's head in. The different factions have slightly different abilities, and the rules see to it that there is no slow building up or even turtling. You're in medias res almost from turn one.

Unfortunately, the battles themselves are restricted to simply adding up a few numbers on the played cards. The only thing to spice it up a little are some unit special abilities but those are so few and far between that the theme quickly evaporates and leaves one hoping that the necessary 20 kills be racked up quickly.

Nice little combat card game, that may remind one of "Summoner Wars", even though they don't have anything in common except that both are card games.

There's some luck of course, but there are quite some possibilities for smart play, too. Also, as the game goes on, the luck-factor decreases, specially if both players know the game.

This game is a great little bit of fun but it's hard to get on the table because it can feel kind of long. So far Templars have been leading in victories despite someone saying Undead is overpowered.

Not played as yet, looking forward to trying it.
Introduced Nathan to it, and it is a hit!

A beautifully drawn wargame that I can take anywhere in my pocket and have the same enjoyment of playing a fantasy battle? This is unique.

An interesting one-on-one battle game. I like the mechanics that force each play to initiate combat, which keeps the pace brisk. In the end, though, I think this lacks some of the depth that Summoner Wars has and is too similar to that title for me to add to the collection.

Kickstarter frenzy strikes again. I get these games that I think would be great tactical games and the I go and suck at them.

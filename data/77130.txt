Longer than the designers would have you believe (4 hrs and we didn't finish) but for anyone who has played the pc game, this is instantly recognisable. All the elements are done very well apart from the combat which is weak (and something FFG always seem to struggle with) and the game just jumps out at me everytime I open the card (only to have to put it back again because we can't fit it into a normal game night)

Wow! What a great game!. I love games with technology trees (or pyramids in this case), battle, and multiple ways to win. This does it all for me. My kids and I have had some great times since Christmas battling it out, or racing up the tech pyramid or culture track or pursuing the coin strategy. 

Combat is easy yet requires some strategy. It's nice not to have to roll a dice to win a battle.

Twilight Imperium III is my all time favorite because of its space theme but this game is a close second and it will see the game table more often because it is playable in 3 hours instead of the 7 hours that TI III takes.

This game has it all!

Great Civ game. Biggest downside is it takes so long to play. Our first game took 6 hours. Also if anyone goes for military, it may make the game less fun for the person attacked.

Recently purchased this game after much deliberation and absolutely love it - in fact it is probably already one of my top 5 favourite games.  It is a little long and on the heavy side for casual gamers, but if you can get enough committed inviduals with time to spare around a table this is epic!  Can't wait for the addition.

7-29-14: For me, the game is just too darn long (6+ hours both times). I don't mind long games if you are actually doing something, but it takes hours to simply move and explore, the battle mechanic is really wonky, and the downtime in between turns is interminable. The ending also seems to be anticlimactic considering the time investment. Too bad, because the components and game itself are beautiful to behold.

Update 9-25-15: played it again recently with 3 players and it was under four hours. This I can tolerate.

Incredible so far after 2 plays. A very similar feeling to the computer game without the micro management. 2nd game was stopped near the end. Girl had previously told me that she had found some Uranium. Later in the game she proceeded to aggressivley blockade my culture tiles in my capital. I attack to get her off my land. After a very lucky win using some steel I had previously traded from her, I then take her only village token. The Uranium. She refuses to play on as was just about to unveil Atmoic Theory tech. SO MUCH FUN.

Anterior(8) Lleva con mucho éxito la experiencia del juego de pc a la mesa con unos asequibles 45 min por jugador. Un buenisimo juego civilizaciones dinamico, con varias opciones para ganar y muy estratégico. Su gran problema y lo que lo convierte en un 8 es que es NECESARIO contar con las dos expansiones para disfrutarlo por completo.

23/08/2016 Teniendo en cuenta el jugo que le estamos sacando útlimamente al juego, es necesario subirle la nota. Se ha convertido en el equivalente en mesa al RTS de turno de pc, cuando nos juntamos los mismos echamos la partidilla y poco a poco vamos cogiéndole mas soltura cada vez.

As I was playing I thought it would be better if there was an app to keep track of everything.  I think it would work better as a computer game.  Wait a minute...

Also, one of the worst combat systems in any game I've played.

RATING: 7.5
Although this one has the full FFG standard problems - everything is a combination of tiny Euro-sized cards sprawling all over the table which inevitably slows the game to a crawl in the final rounds - and I'm certain the wheels come off with some combination of cards (FFG is famous for this flaw). And yet for all that, it completely captures the feel of a computer Civ game from Sid himself. It needs this type of treatment. And it is aptly named for sure. It is much better than Clash of Cultures by a wide margin and more epic feeling than Nations could ever be. So it's fantastic. I really liked my play of this one. I think the combat system is odd and certainly over done - it would have improved the game to simplify that part. Still, if you want the *full* Sid Civ experience in a board game, this one is the best I've seen so far.

Esta bastante conseguido y con mucha variedad de opciones que hacer y de tipos de victoria con las que ganar. Sólo para jugones auténticos y amantes del juego de PC. Te vas a las 3-4 horas de juego, o más, pero se disfruta si te gusta de verdad. Las 2 expansiónes aportan más líderes, alguna cosilla interesante, nada determinante, pero están a precio de 2 juegos nuevos, cosa que me parece pasarse mucho por parte de Edge. Jugado a 5 con ambas expansiones, equilibran algo más parte cultural y económica y la segunda expansión mejora muy ligeramente el combate pero no hay nada decisivo, son más variedad, alguna incluso un tanto desequilibrante. En el juego de pc vas un poco a todo o puedes especializarte en algo, aquí o te especializas del principio casi en una única victoria o lo tienes complicado, y se convierte el juego en una especie de carrera hacia ese tipo de victoria... por lo que me gustaría un sistema en que una vez que se "cierre la partida por algún tipo de victoria" se hiciera un recuento de puntos de victoria de todas las categorías, que de normal seguiría ganando quien cerró partida... o puede que no... y así fomentar el uso de todo, y no dejarte la cultura casi a 0 si te centras en lo militar, etc.

Peguitas de pequeñas erratas en cartas, y de diseño de traseras de cartas de unidades de combate, que deberían ser simétricas para por si acaso, no dar pistas en combate al contrario...

Lo mejor, en mi opinión, las tecnologías y sus variables.

Lo peor del juego, sin duda es su sistema de combate, es absurdo, lineal, sin ningún tipo de emoción, muy aburrido. 

Por ello he testeado varias opciones, con las propias cartas del juego, variantes mías de reglas de combate, que, con los mismos componentes del juego, sin usar dados, o usando hasta 7D6, mejoran, equilibran y hacen muchísimo más emocionante el combate, sin apenas alargar el juego :)

Comparing the board game with the computer game makes no justice to either of the games.

Civilization the Board Game is a great game offering lot of fun. It really captures the feel of building your own nation. However, it suffers from a few annoying characteristics that I reckon to be intentional for gameplay purposes. 

First of all, technological win is very hard to achieve. Researching is more like a timer forcing the game to end at some point. Basically everyone is researching a new tech each round. This leads to a situation in which the player starting the 15th round will win, provided that he has the trade needed. You can also do very little to rush your technological progress. All this makes the players to pursue victory via warfare, culture or coins (which have nothing to do with economy).

Secondly, the culture scoring and coin mechanisms have a very artificial feel to them. Your great cities do not automatically produce culture despite having all the wonders, universities, cathedrals etc. Instead, you have to skip your whole production to get that culture out of them. Doesn't really make sense to me. The thing with the coins is that I do not really understand what do they represent. You can find them on map or get them from a tech, great person, after winning a battle, etc. or by spending trade (=money). Yes, you spend money to get coins.

Third annoying thing are the wonders. If there are no wonders worth building and no one is building them, the game sees no wonders built at all. The wonders available should be refreshed every now and then.

But if you're ready to accept the shortcomings mentioned above, you'll get a great game.

Played twice. Punched and bagged, complete. When did downtime become a bad thing? The simultaneous actions during a turn are annoying, plus when am I suppose to go get a beer? The game would have been better with each player taking their whole turn in turn and rotating the start player. The components are beautiful but as usual FFG inundates you with bits, sometimes less is more.

Faithful to the PC game.
Interesting choices and multiple paths to victory.

However, the multitudes of option comes at a cost. The game is a prime candidate for AP nightmares.

If someone could fix the military aspect part of the game it would be a pure 10. Reminds me of the computer game.

This is not the computer game. It feels very short, not epic as you would feel with the computer version. I'm willing to play it anytime, but won't ask for it. Military aspect of the game doesn't bother me anymore.

All in all, a solid game, just not the top notch.

I like that many paths lead to victory which ensures variety, however, some paths are more difficult to play, 
especially the coins path is quite easy, but it is fixed in the first expansion. 
It is still a 4x game, the military path is too destructive for my taste. 
Play time is on the long side, there is some downtime but players may sometimes play simultaneous. 
Overall, the rules feel very overwhelming in the first game. There are a lot of cards, components, and game mechanics to keep in mind.
You have to count your generated resources each round which I do not like, it is cumbersome.
After playing the first game, rules are okay, still fiddly - especially the combat rules are just complicated.
You also have to frequently look what other players do, otherwise they might just win in the next minute. This is quite tricky, because you have to look closely from a distance due to the big game board (a lot of table space is required). Thus, the game might feel quite solitaire, if players concentrate too much on their own player boards.
I highly recommend using the condensed rules from Esoteric Order of Gamers.
On the positive side, each game creates a unique and fun story to talk about after the game is over.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I didn't like Civilization so much. For start the board looks really too busy, the components are not so nice and the artwork is nothing special for me. It feels too long, over-complicated and, even if it has technologies, which is a thing I'm a sucker for, I don't like how they work. I don't like also the card combat and it really bothers me how the resources are produced, because it makes no sense to me. Finally the cherry on top is, that the board makes my OCD scream of pain with those non-contiguous land tiles.

Therefore, even if I liked the aspect of the buildings quite a lot, I didn't particularly enjoy this game. It was mediocre and it didn't leave me that desire of playing it again.

Did not play the computer version before. But this game do not give me the feeling of any CIV game. 

In fact it feels like an upgraded RISK like game with fiddly card rules to break or assist the main rules. There was no feel of a civilization growing but a mad rush to get victory points to win a long drawn out game. 

I rather play a 10 hour Civilization game by AH.

Picked up a copy from Game Kastle.  Ran through couple of turns with my son and it is very simple in play but it is all in the strategy.

4P Learning game on 11/27, have to reread the combat which was kind of unclear.  

Finally had a 2P full game, Tech victory.  I won as the Egyptian vs the Rome.  Took about 4 hrs with lots of interruptions.

Finished a 2P full game with Aaron at Kublacon 2011.  Roman (Aaron) vs Russian(me)  Tech Victory by me, 2.5 hr.

RATING: 7
A thoughtfully designed game that plays surprisingly easily given the huge number of components. It does a great job capturing many components of the computer game, especially the fun of exploration and discovery, the feeling of progress, and the manifold paths to victory.

Unfortunately, it does not replicate the computer game's sweeping scale--players are limited to only three cities, which almost always all get founded in the first few turns. The game is paced very fast--it's a rare game that lasts more than thirteen or so turns--so expect something much more frenetic than the slow and steady civilizational progress of the original game.

There are severe balance issues in the original. The economic victory is by far the easiest of the four, and the culture victory significantly more difficult. This can be pretty easily balanced with some houserules. (I recommend removing one or two trade from barracks and capping all techs that grant coins at three. It's also a good idea to increase the number of coins required for economic victory to sixteen and knock a space or two off the culture track.)

My other major complaint with the original is a rather clunky combat system, which I understand is replaced in one of the expansions. At least the bigger, better equipped army usually wins, so that's something.

On the whole, this is an enjoyable experience. The ending is usually quite dramatic as all the civs close in on their different victory conditions at about the same time and employ every trick in the book to inch ahead.

You might want to treat my rating with caution.  Not only is it based on a single play but it was a play that made use of both expansions.

I like this Civilization more than I should.  At heart it's a game of making the optimum use of available resources to build an engine that will deliver the military power, cultural advancement or wealth necessary for the win. In this respect it is as much an efficiency game as any cube pushing euro. 

There also isn't a great deal of interaction until a likely series of endgame battles.  This Civ lacks the trading economy that was such a feature of Francis Tresham's classic design.  Add to this that despite the different victory conditions to aim for, falling behind in military technology will very probably be punished severely.  There is also no tech tree.  Given two first level techs of any kinds, I can buy any second level tech.  Horse riding and animal husbandry really can be the precursors of the printing press.  Both cultural advancement (which grants take that cards) and a combat system more reminiscent of Battleline/Schotten Totten than it ought to be, are weak.     

This game (certainly with both expansions) has a pronounced learning curve.  As with all complex efficiency engines, it will take a while to find the keys and work out what the many levers do. 

Good points there are.  These include surprisingly little downtime; turns are divided into five phases, each with a small number of options.  Despite the incongruities noted above, there is a real sense of building a civilization. I guess the beauty of there being no tech tree is that a wide range of options for advancement is always open. The various cultures also seem to be interestingly differentiated on first acquaintance. For a game of Kevin Wilson/FFG parentage that features the usual piles of cards and chits, SMC:TBG is surprisingly streamlined and lacking in fiddliness.

While this game will disappoint those who crave a box brim full of miniatures, it is up to FFG's usual good standards production-wise.  The artwork is very pleasing too.

One of my favorite city building civilization games.I like it a lot especially with the 2 expansions, that add more interesting things in the game like social policies, investments, city states etc.
What it bothers me a little in this game are these:
1) There aren't some prerequisite on the researchs you make.Especially the researchs where you can unlock the upgraded building without need to unlock the 1st building (example unlock academy without unlocking barracks).
2) It will be more interesting if instead of army flags,there were units and not making battles with random unit cards.

It's a fairly good game, it's quite long and ultimately comes down to fine-tuning the efficiency engine. Somehow haven't been rushing back to it, not really sure why. I suppose I just don't feel like I've built a whole Civilization I'm proud of, which is what I want from a game like this.

Captures the spirit of Civ on PC relatively well. The full board game and components take up a lot of table real estate due to how many mechanics and aspects to each player's single civilization.

Civilization in a box. I really enjoy this game, and would not mind playing it more. I just wish some of the technologies were more globally useful. 

This game was the site of one of my biggest jerk move ever. A four player game, with one new player, where two players decided to (I hate that his is not mechanically established) ally and attack the new player. I was attempting to win by tech, and realized that they would conquer this new player the turn before I would get Space Flight. I flew (I was the only one with flight) all my units over to the new player's capitol to safeguard my victory. He was very grateful. Then, after a very dark "ah ha!" moment, I turned around and turned his capitol to ash myself. It still haunts me.

It si better than the computer game! Need I say more? If there's was an option to win w/o playing techer, the rating would be 10.

Update: after 2 more plays, I am rating this as an 8. The combat is too random, the military victory seems way more difficult to achieve than any other. The Victory through Culture is by far the easiest. I still enjoy this game a lot, but ranking the ways to victory in a quite obvious way.

It does play a bit like the original version of the computer game. A variety of ways to win helps, although some are easier than others (especially technology). 3-player worked nicely, although there was no player combat it worked well and nobody was way ahead or way behind. 4 players took too long, even accounting for the learning. Combat (base game) is the weak part though.

Highly underrated game! This is my favorite map-based civilization building game released to date.  I think it may be rated lower than it should because of two realities - some people will down it because its based on an IP, and other who want it BECAUSE its based on the Civ video games who realize its not quite the same as the computer version.  I don't get either argument.  The game itself stands on its own, and plays amazingly well with any player count.  It has just the right amount of complexity as well.

Very good, solid game. Plays well with any number. Needs a rules cleanup and streamlining and a little rebalancing of coin and culture victories. Expansion expected soon.

This civilization game certainly has a lot of interesting details and paths to pursue towards meeting one of the four ways to win the game: conquer a capital city, max out on the culture track, max out on the money track, or build up your tech tree and reach space flight.  It doesn't particularly flow in a euro game sense, but then again, how could it when it aspires to include essentially everything!?

It is interesting to consider this game alongside the other omnibus civ game: Clash of Cultures.  This game feels perhaps a bit more complete and dare I say educational in a good way, while C of C feels more playable.  C of C perhaps has the advantage of providing many (perhaps too many) benchmark objectives that must be met in order to win the game.  With a very nicely implemented tech tree, for my tastes, C of C is probably the better game overall.  However, this game feels like a fuller more complete exploration of civilization.  It teaches you more!  You get a serious civilization building experience.

RATING: 5
As similar to the computer game as a board game can get, I guess. Unfortunately this means that it has inherited the negative features as well: It is way too long. Almost impossible to play during one evening, especially if you are 4 players.

The culture victory is not realistic when there is only 2 players as many of the culture cards (i.e. the benefit of devoting cities to the art) are beneficial for both players. Exchange of Ideas loses some of it's value for example.

So, 4 players are too long and 2 players are limited.

For the amount of time spent I rather play a couple of other games instead.

Incredible experience - our first game came down to the wire with everyone almost pulling out a victory in the last 2 turns (using all 4 tracks). A surprise airstrike ended the game in favor of the Germans while the Russians were about to win a tech victory and the Chinese were about to win a cultural victory.

Definitely fills the Epic niche for me. The tech tree is amazingly simple however offers lots of room for customization. With different paths to victory it seems to offer balance between different strategies however neglecting any one comes with a cost. More plays will tell if the replayability is there.

Good board game implementation of the computer games. Only real down side is the terrible combat mechanic. Expansion helps flesh out the game and balances out the victory conditions instead of heavily favouring an economic victory. Sold as we just weren't playing it enough.

Like the production, although the box is tight once the bits are punched.  Very impressed with the layout of the rulebook.  Large investment to learn, set up, and play for a long-length middleweight game.  The most exciting part for me was the culture deck, and I didn't find the tech tree that interesting despite enjoying the pyramid layout.  I think I might actually like the combat system too.  Buildings are probably the least interesting bit to me, and I especially don't get anything out of planning their placement.  Only one play with 3P, which demonstrated an epic potential for downtime.  Rules say best with 4P, I think I still want to try 2P first.

At this point, the element I appreciate the most about this game is are the variable player powers and the four victory conditions. It certainly feels lighter than Through the Ages, although comparing the two doesn't seem all that fair.

RATING: 5
8/15/2015: This is a sandbox type game.  I can see why it's not more popular and not discussed more widely.  There are so many dials, that you need to play several times to figure out what's going on. You're going to be frustrated the first several times that you play with more experienced players.  It's a longer game, so you're going to have to invest a fair amount of time understanding the game, and I'm not sure that the payoff is worth it.  Also if you're inexperienced, it seems that luck and randomness play a large factor, which is not necessarily good in a long game like this.

That said, it is a faithful adaptation of the computer game.

The game that I'd rather play is "Through the Ages."

12/28/10: Preliminary rating after 1 play.  

I like civ games, but I think that this is too fiddly for me.  Much worse than Through the Ages, because there are not resource tracks to record your production and you need to count it for every city every turn.  The game really slowed down for me towards the end.  Definitely need to play it again to see if my feelings are on base or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost a direct to board game translation of the computer game, which I consider the top five games of all time. 

This is meaty, but lots of details, and folks who haven't played Civilization might find it overwhelming.

It's got more OOMPH than my other favorite, Clash of Cultures, but can get bogged down in minutae, so isn't for light fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After one play with 4 people playing for the first time, I was left with a rather negative first impression. The game was very long, somewhat boring and dragged a lot at some stages. Granted, the situation was about the worse you could think about for this; and even Through the Ages, one of my favourites, drags too much with 4, so I want to play again with two or three to see how it goes.

Also, I'm not too sure about the balance in some parts, notably victory conditions, civs, wonders and culture cards: some seem much stronger than others. Still, it's unfair to judge from a single play and it could be a question of context and tayloring your strategy to a goal.

In all, I was left with the feeling that if I wanted to play a civ type game for a few hours while ranting about downtime, I already have a better alternative.

A little too early to tell on this one.

It feels a lot like the computer game (which I like) but it also has the ability to really make players feel like they're waaay out of the game with no hope of competing (exactly like the computer game)

Basically, if you don't get 3 cities, you lose, and if the other players manage to get 3 cities before you do, or choke you out of your 3rd city, you lose.

Who knows, maybe the appeal will grow once I have a couple of plays under my belt that aren't games where I got utterly stomped.

Otro juegazo. Se busca la sensación de crear una civilización y hacerla avazar a través del tiempo.... y se encuentra. Todo funciona. 6 culturas compensadas, 4 maneras distintas de ganar... y todo encaja. Las mecánicas son sencillas y las posibilidades infinitas. Los componentes sensacionales y la complejidad de reglas media. Al principio abruma pero en realidad luego da gustito digerirlas, es un placer... pòco a poco...
De momento me falta ver ganar por cultura aunque he estdo cerca de conseguirlo. Nada que no arregle en otra partida, ¿hace una?.

Hopelessly imbalanced in favor of the coin strategy.

Might take a while to get through it.

RATING: 8
A 2010-es esseniek közül ez is benne volt az általam legjobban várt 3 játékban, sajnos csak a 2011-es esseni áradat közepette, 1 éves késéssel sikerült kipróbálni. 1992-94 közt sokat játszottam a PC-s változat legelső részével, és a későbbi részek többségét is próbáltam, ennek megfelelően ez nekem egy kötelező darab volt. Röviden a véleményem: jól megcsinálták, helyenként egész jól visszaadja a számítógépes változat lényegét! Szép, igényes, szinte minden oké vele...
Egyetlen nagy hibája, hogy az egyik nyerési mód teljesen esélytelen a másik hárommal szemben. A gazdasági győzelem talán a legkönnyebb, a katonai és a tudományos sem tűnik nehéznek. Ezzel szemben a kulturális győzelem szinte teljesen esélytelennek tűnik! A mi 2 személyes partinkban az egyik fél a kulturális győzelemre ment rá, ami kb. a 20. körben valósulhatott volna meg. Eközben a másik fél a 12. körben nyert gazdaságilag de úgy, hogy a katonai vagy tudományos győzelmet is választhatta volna 1 vagy 2 körön belül. Egy parti alapján talán korainak tűnik ezt kerek perec kijelenteni, de mások is írták, hogy a kulturális veszett ügy. Azért ez elég nagy tesztelési hiba (vagy mi játszottuk alapvetően rosszul).
De ettől függetlenül kifejezetten jó játék, amelynek elég bonyolult a rendszere, az a minden mindennel összefügg kategória, de a szabály végére már átlátható, és érezhető, hogy jól felépített rendszerrel van dolgunk.
A 3 szerintem ténylegesen nyerési esélyt kínáló győzelmi mód nagyon szellemes, lényegesen eltérő, és elég sok újrajátszhatóságot rejt magában szerintem.
Amit külön kiemelnék, az a csaták megoldása (külön egységkártya paklikkal, Schotten-tottenre vagy az 1960 vitáira emlékeztető módon, csak itt 1-1 kártya lehet max. egy oldalon): ötletes, élvezetes, de kicsit nagyobb erőkülönbségnél már szinte teljesen esélytelennek érzem a gyengébb felet.
Ami még említést érdemel, az a játék hossza: fél óra felpakolás, 1 óra szabálymagyarázat, és szerintem játékosonként 80-90 perces játékidő... Szóval nem rövid! A szabály egyébként elég logikus...
A játék nagyon nyelvfüggő, szóval jó, hogy kiadták magyarul!
Civilizációs játékokat kedvelőknek kötelező, de a TTA azért jobb!
(Még egy dolog: csodákat mi haszontalannak éreztük a játékban, mire építeni tudtunk volna, már majdnem vége volt a játéknak....és sokkal kevesebbet hoznak, mint amibe kerülnek... Vagy rosszul gondolom?)
---
Emlékeztem, hogy tetszett, de mivel nem akartam a 4 és fél éve játszott egyetlen partira alapozni, újra elővettem, hogy eldöntsem, eladom-e. Nos a játék szerintem nagyon jó, és néhány dolog, amit elsőre véltünk a játékról, így a második parti után teljesen más megvilágításba került. Először is a csodák nagyon is jók tudnak lenni, és megérhetik az árukat. Mi most ketten megépítettünk 7 vagy 8 csodát a 12-ből, mindketten le is cseréltünk egyet. Valószínűleg azért érte meg, mert tovább tartott a játék, mint a múltkor, ennek oka pedig az volt, hogy most jól játszottuk az aranyszerzős részt. Mert én nagyon úgy emlékszem, hogy anno úgy játszottuk, hogy a térképen a külvárosban lévő aranyat választhattam körről körre a városirányítási fázisban, ami így utólag teljesen logikátlan. Szóval az csak fix 1 arany, nem pedig jövedelem. Így viszont (jól játszva) egyáltalán nem könnyebb a 15 arany se, mint a többi cél. Ami durva, hogy ma épp az első parti után lesajnált kulturális győzelmet szereztem meg. A vége felé 1 körben 20 feletti kultúra zsetont tudtam szerezni (egyik városból pl a telepes által hazaküldött 2-vel együtt 9-et!, csodákból kör elején 4, stb.), pedig nem is azzal a néppel voltam, ami segíti a kultúrát. Hubi hasonlóan jól állt technikában, pedig nem az erre optimalizált néppel volt. Érdekesség még a mai partiban, hogy a fővárosomhoz a végén már 5 arany tartozott (jól húztam a híres embereket). Szerintem nagyon sok újrajátszhatóság van a játékban, máris elkezdtek érdekelni a kiegek, pedig tudom, hogy a hossza miatt sajnos nehezen kerül elő... A TTA a civilizációs játékok csúcsa, de ez is szuper, bizonyos dolgokban még jobb is, pl. van térkép, kézzel fogható egységek... Szóval tuti megtartom!

Resembles the computer game a lot. WOW factor is max. The battle system is actually one of the strong elements in the game. My expectations for a pure 10 were not met, since I did not enjoy excellence in the pure civ aspect -the game is a bit more ameritrash than I'd like. Military conflict plays an important role and player interaction is more fierce than I would like. Resources are very scarce. I'd like to see a cuba-like mechanism that transforms resources into vps but there isn't any-well, there are some but you have to sacrifice your action to collect a resource. That's my greatest disappointment. Another one is that lots of the technologies -at least half I think- are aimed towards military confict and not civ development. One should try to keep a defense army and attack at the correct moment when he needs the benefits most. Wish it was more of a civ and less of an Ameritrash. Still it is a game I compare to and enjoy more than Twilight Imperium, which means: excellent work Kevin!

This game does a great job in reproducing the spirit of the videogame, and is also a very good game: there's multiple ways to win, tech trees, combat and lots of player interaction.
Every aspect of the game is interwoven with others, and every move has lots of cascading effects.
There are some lacking aspects, however: the production is good but not great, it takes lots of space for playing (and the small components are not easily recognizable from the other side of the table), and the rulebook is typical FFGesque: lots of unanswered question and an entire paragraph missing (the one about wonders display refresh)!

The original Tresham  Civilization is still the best boardgame in the genre. There's a lot of management and things going on, but in my opinion somethings just getting better and some don't. Heavy gamers will say you have to make the right choices and they are right, but if you don't find the right resources you can have a problem. I won't break down the game but at this moment this game is a bit too high rated. Maybe I'm too much a European for this kind of games.
My second play was a lot better : we made a major mistake in the first game, but now because of playing the game right, it's a lot longer.

This reminds me of Twilight Imperium and other FFG games because it has just a little too many random things going on. I would have preferred no cards for combat and instead dice roll modifiers. The culture cards seemed chaotic too. I don't care for plastic pieces and the art has this cartoonish look that I'm not a fan of. It is typical FFG, high quality but not to my tastes. Nonetheless I would like to explore the game further, it does have depth.

First Play: In with a 8.5 rating with a bullet. Whats not to like about this. Production quality and art work is sublime (although I would have prefered wooden scouts and armies). The rules are extremely well written and unambiguous. Examples are clear and the game flows very well. The only thing that takes time to absorb is the function and flow of the tech and buildings. So many ways to grab that victory.

A game that just begs the next session. Cant wait.

Second Play (c 1 year later with 3 new players): Just like starting out again but still a very well received game. Would like tyo play again soon.

Fantastic, epic civ game. I have never played the PC game, so I don't know how they compare. I enjoy just about every aspect of this game. The different Civilizations all feel quite different and really give you a set strategy to go for when you start playing. Multiple winning conditions is also a very cool thing to me in games and this has 3 ways to win! Some comments stated the combat was clunky, but I had no problem with it. This is a keeper for me and probably an "evergreen" in my top 100 games.

this is a hard game.its a gamers game where you need 2-3 plays to completely grasp it.it really gets the theme of the pc game to the table.there is a lot of stuff you get in the box for that price.

negatives:
i dont like how the exploration works in this.the movement of the tiles completely destroys the visual aspect of the game makes it almost abstract.

the fighting is dull.its tided with technologies i get that.but its almost i do this and then i do that feeling.meh."

this is more personal gribe.i am a little bit paranoid about many components.there is a lot in this.you need a bigger table for the game.also setup time is longer.

i will probably not own it since its a complex game and i would get it to the table like once a year probably.

Man, do I love this game!

It offers immense complexity, variety, great stories, plenty of strategy and planning. You'll be evolving your civilization through research, exploration, war, trade, and construction! It's up to you what you will focus on.

I don't know how they manage to do this but I have not played a single game of Civilization that didn't end in a nail-bitingly dramatic finale. Every game feels unique and it's always tough to say who will win the game in the end. 

The four different victory conditions make room for uncertainty, as you never quite know what victory condition the other players are going for. The various civilizations have very distinct strengths, and usually the player who uses their civilization's powers most effectively ends up as the victor.

Every decision I make feels important in this game. When I lose it is mostly because I messed up, not because of some random events that I couldn't have predicted or avoided. 

It's not for everyone though, as it is very complex. For people who primarily enjoy light games there will be too many choices to make. Also you need at least one game to get a hang of all the different strategies that are possible. There are sooo many options and decisions to make every single turn. Many people will dislike it due to analysis paralysis. Also it is very long, especially the first few games. 

That being said, if you're looking for a game that tells a different story each time you play it and that gives you a feeling of impact and control over your empire, then give this game a try!

Very good, a game I would like to play much more. Too bad that it, like most of my favorite games, is a long game. Being "forced" to play games mostly on normal weekday evenings means a game that takes 4 hours is usually out, and while this could play shorter with experience I doubt we will be able to get there. But it's a lot of fun. Civ upgrades, combat, tech trees, it's all there.

RATING: 8
I don’t consider myself a civilization games enthusiast but usually I feel somewhat compelled to play them whenever I’m given the opportunity: so I couldn’t draw back from trying out Sid Meier’s Civilization, which I liked much better than I thought I would.

Sure, there are many things in Sid Meier’s Civilization I still can’t stand, such as the limited culture cards hand, the small number of cities you may build and the dedicated single resource they may collect each turn, yet all in all I enjoy this game a lot, as it really gives you the feeling you’re building your own civilization: there are just so many things you can do and so many ways to win that in the end you can’t be disappointed by your playing it.

Nonetheless, all this complexity comes with a downside: the game is so exacting you don’t usually care for what your opponents are doing in their turns as you have to carefully plan your moves in advance, which makes interaction among the players minimal and the whole playing like a huge brain-burner you simply have to optimize.

But I guess this is why Civilization is regarded as a heavy game.

The short playtime (2-3 hours), excellent strategic options and nice tactical choices make this game my favourite of the moment.

RATING: 8.5
Yet another chapter in the quest for the holy grail of civilization building games unfolds. Every time I see a game like this I wonder, will this be the one? AH's "Civilization" set an early high bar. "Mare Nostrum" was close but needed an expansion to finish the design; "Rise of Empires" was worthy but the rulebook was badly flawed in production; "Tempus," was hyped but quickly  disappointed; the Eagle Game's original go at "Sid Meier's Civilization: the Board Game" tried hard but missed badly. The best board game implementation of Sid's classic PC game, so far, has been "Through the Ages." ("7 Ages"? Don't get me started).

So, when the FFG version appeared I had to pay attention. It looked and sounded good. I couldn't wait to try it.
++++++
After a couple of plays, I have mixed feelings. It's quite good, very good in fact. It has captured the feel of the PC game without being bogged down in too much micro-management ("counting cows"). There are a lot of moving parts, but after a couple of sessions the flow of the game smooths out and things fit together very well. The way the "armies" and "military units" are managed, along with the combat system, is novel and clever. 

There are several niggles however. The tech card system is a bit bloated and space consuming - it might have been better to use a paper record of some type like the original "Civilization" or "Age of Renaissance" (a handy such file is already available). I'm not yet certain that the different paths to victory (tech/gold/culture/conquest) are balanced. And, this game really needs to be played by four - three player games are often likely to be problematic for one of the players.

So, another worthy entry in the Civ family and a game I expect to be playing a fair bit; but, the quest goes on...

Inital rating - need to play it more.

I so want to like this game, but inital feeling is it is just too long and fiddly for the streamlined experience I was hoping for. Why play this when you could play it on the PC and have all the fancy graphics and the computer do the fiddly mechanics?

Not yet convinced it really works multiplayer, if one player decides to go the military route ... But all multiplayer conflict games have this potential problem, and I could see this decend into AP hell with 4 ...

Why didn't they include a nifty dial to track the trade and production and culture values for each of your cities, game seems to end up with players counting these values over and over and over.

Final thought - why play this instead of through the ages? This is a bit easier to teach, a bit more forgiving of early mistakes (but not much) and has a map - but I think I prefer to play TtA.

This game has a lot of potential and does a great job of capturing much of the essence of Civ, but it suffers from what seem to be typical fantasy flight issues.  Too many fiddly bits, 'clunkiness', unbalanced starting civs and the length is too long.  Our 4 player game took 5+ hours and it just felt bogged down all the time.  I don't mind long games if they don't feel slow, but this did.  I'd be willing to play this again, but with my high expectations I was disappointed.

Wasn't blown away by my first play.  There are aspects of it I really like, multiple strategies/paths to victory.  My concerns are with downtime and the military victory being too easy.  The former I think could be mitigated by allowing everyone to take their city management phases simultaneously.  The latter just needs to be checked by other players, which is a bit disappointing.

A shortish (although I'd say this is still pretty long) Civ building game is kind of a holy grail of board game design. And this does capture the feel of the PC game Civ maybe better than any other game.  But maybe going for a copy of the PC game isn't the best idea.  I would rather play the computer game than this as there's just a lot of fiddlyness and seemingly unnecessary complexity here.  Too much stuff to track and too cluttered.  For a civ building board game it would probably be best to start from scratch design-wise.

Juego de desarrollo de civilización, con tablero modular, para 2 a 4 jugadores. Cada jugador empieza con una ciudad y dos fichas. A lo largo de la partida puede llegar a tener hasta tres ciudades.  Hay varios tipos de victoria: Económica (si consigues reunir 15 monedas), cultural (si llevas al final del track de cultura), militar (si conquistas la capital de otro jugador) o tecnológica (si llegas a desarrollar la única tecnología de nivel 5) que hay en el juego.

Cada turno tiene 5 fases: cambio de turno y de gobierno, comercio, gestión de la ciudad (cada ciudad te permite una acción a escoger entre tres: comprar/construir, dedicarte a las artes y otra que no me acuerdo), mover piezas y desarrollar tecnología.

Las reglas no son complicadas en absoluto y las posibilidades del juego son muy grandes. El tema está muy trabajado. Muy recomendable.. es del nivel del civilization original, pero se puede jugar en menos tiempo (a cuatro jugadores, pongamosle 4 horas).

Juego de exploración y desarrollo de civilización. Cada jugador tiene una ciudad (puede llegar a tener tres) y dispone de tantas acciones como ciudades tenga. Admite muchos caminos hacia la victoria. Ésta puede ser militar (conquistando una capital de un adversario), cultural (llegando al final del track de cultura), económica (consiguiendo 15 monedas) o tecnológica (desarrollando la unica tecnología de nivel cinco en el juego). Es un juego intenso, y con la profundidad de los juegos clásicos de civilización, pero en mucho menos tiempo (4 horas, aproximadamente, quizás menos).
Recomendable.

Awesome game! Really captures the epic feel of the Civ franchise! I could not picture a better translation of the PC game to a board game than this! Love the various ways to victory and the combat is unique. Love the various technology cards and how they can be used to assist the different strategical approaches to the game. Great depth of strategy and I think this game will only get better the more it is played! It runs a little on the long side, but anyone who is used to playing Civ on the PC is already used to devoting a whole night to the game.

Again, great game and very high on my faves list! Highly recommend to any fan of the Sid Meier's Civ franchise!

A surprisingly big hit in my gaming group.

This game has a ton of components. Setup is long. You'll spend a lot of time adding up values--expect to spend a minute or two manually counting up trade and production every turn.

But if you can get past the clunkiness, it really does do a remarkable job translating an incredible number of features from the video game. Research, exploration, culture, trade, warfare, resources, great people, wonders, multiple victory conditions... they're all there. It's kind of spectacular. 

The last few turns tend to be really exciting as everyone closes in on a different victory condition. Every single game I've played has had a fun and dramatic finish.

I think the mechanic that limits the number of available resources and buildings is very clever and works really well. You can potentially hoard all the Iron to give yourself a military advantage, or hoard the Incense to stop another player from winning culturally. There's always a race to see who can get the Barracks, because if they split 2-2-0 in a 3-player game, the player with 0 is going to be massively vulnerable. It's good stuff.

The biggest gameplay issue is a rather clumsy combat system. This is greatly improved by the Wisdom and Warfare expansion.

Finally, here are two house rules that I think improve the base game:
--Remove the 2 trade from the Barracks. (This building is already strong enough without also being a terrific economic building.)
--Increase the economic victory requirement from 15 to 16 coins, and have each coin-granting tech max out at 3 (rather than 4) coins. (Economic victory is far too easy in the base game.)

Un juego con muchas opciones de desarrollo, de victoria y de expansión. No tiene unas reglas demasiado complejas, pero es un juego con mucha profundidad. Además es muy vistoso. Las partidas suelen estar limitadas en el tiempo a 3-4 horas, al contrario que en otros juegos de civilizaciones, ya que un tipo de victoria,(tecnológica) se consigue casi siempre tras 15 turnos.
Sin embargo, no me ha generado la sensación de estar "desarrollando" una civilización, colonizando territorios o haciendo descubrimientos o avances culturales, ni de tener ningún control sobre lo que estaba pasando (por la gran cantidad de opciones).

It's a big game, but I'm not convinced.  It reflects the computer game very well, but combat is a little bizarre.  I would need several more plays to understand the game properly, and so decide whether or not I agree with the various abilities and nations, etc...  But, critically, I'm really not sure it's rewarding enough for the time effort necessary to achieve that understanding.  It's a 6+ hour game and would need to be much more immediately effective to me for it to warrant the repeated play required.

I can see what they tried to achieve here with this but I'm not sure the execution was right. The game is way too long with 4 players and has little to no interaction with 2. The combat is absolutely horrible and the science or combat routes to victory always seem way better than the culture path.

It succeeds at being reminiscent of the computer game, and is a great game on its own.

I like the tech pyramid, the exploration on the map, and the combat system. I don't like that the different nations seem a bit unbalanced, at least to me as a newbie. The setup is a bit tedious with so many components.

I realized that I'm actually not a big fan of games of this complexity level. That's not a critique of this game in particular, others probably think that this is the best part about it: This game has so many options to explore, a huge number of technologies, many different nations, buildings, wonders and culture cards and different victory conditions. This means that even after several plays, I'm feeling like I'm still learning the game, and not really playing it. And since the game takes quite long, I just don't find the time needed to fully explore this game. Not knowing your options forces you to play by gut most of the time, instead of actually evaluating different options and developing a strategy.

Far too fiddly for me.
We started the game with only a partial explanation of the rules and I still don't know what some of the pieces do or how you get them... but do I really care?
I enjoyed destroying one of each of my opponents' wonders in the same turn and ending the game (after 4 hours) on a double attack on my neighbor's cities, with one win and one predictable loss. I should have gone for the third city to my reach too, but didn't want to over-extend what was already too long a game.
I'm glad I got to try it, but I doubt there will be another play for me.

Interesting and well balanced civilization building game. Certainly the best with "Sid Meier" in its name. However, in my first game I had the impression that there are a few luck factors with a bit too much impact on the game, notably world wonder building order and uranium findings. On the other hand this impression may have been caused by lack of experience.

This is my first "civilization" style board game, having never played any of the older ones.  I really love it, and wish I had a chance to play more often.  It's an amazingly faithful adaptation of the computer game series, and yet manages to be great fun as a board game.  The civilizations are interesting and varied, the game has just enough randomness in terrain and battles to keep it interesting over multiple plays, and the theme is strong and fun.  The only thing that keeps it from being rated higher is the combat system, which is a little silly.

Short version: there's a lot here to like but it's a little too footery and a lot too long to be a game I can love - I do like it though.  Long version: this has most of the things you expect from a Civ game - cities which gather resources ... which let you research technologies ... which unlock buildings ... which enhance your cities ... and an exploration/combat element as you send your scouts and armies into the unexplored wilderness to discover friendly villages, vanquish hostile tribes, establish new cities and conquer other empires.  There are, of course, Wonders to build too and opportunities to improve your culture and wealth.  While this is similar to the computer game, it's done in a proper board gamey way, which mostly works well and has a 'euro' feel to it, which I like.  What I didn't like was the 'take that' elements, which are mostly crudely done, and some other randomness - the problem isn't that there's a lot of it but rather that what there is can have a big impact, without there being enough opportunities for it to even out.  The presentation is mostly impressive, very plush as you'd expect from FFG, but I found some of the icons a little unclear and some of the components could be better designed to make the game easier to play without reference to the rules - which are on the long side but not too complex - e.g. the technology cards and building counters don't show discounts on Wonders or terrain restrictions on building.  Unfortunately, even with three players, it's a bit too long to finish in an evening and the addition of a fourth (the recommended number) will delay rather than hasten the end, making it an all day affair - which is simply too long for what it is.  Shame, as I do like it.

Interesting game with tons of options.  Love the tech system (second only to Eclipse) and the exploration aspect.  The nations are all richly detailed and interesting in their own right.

I was not too fond of the combat, though.  It reminded me of FFG's Starcraft The Boardgame, although dumbed down and much less interesting.  I also have a huge problem with how important luck is, in regard to your initial soldier draw and your encounters with natives.  I got hosed in the two games I played, being dealt ones and twos only on my soldier cards.  This basically sets you back at least a turn right from the gate.

I really love the first part of the game- building your engine and customizing your civilization. It feels so good to see your little city sprawl out across a corner of the game-world. If it continued like that, it would be higher- maybe even top 10. But once you realize your best chance of winning, you tend to start spamming actions every turn in order to achieve your victory of choice. It's still fun, but the end game is less interesting than the initial half for me.

I LOVE the computer game Civilization; it is by far my most played computer game ever (Civ II and III), so I was very eager to try this game. What I found did have a few similarities to the computer game, but they were mostly shallow (and I actually think that other civilization games like Through the Ages and Clash of Cultures remind me more of PC Civ).
Even if the game shouldn't be judged on how much it reminds me of Civ, but rather be judged on its own, it's impossible to totally ignore this fact. 

Now, the game itself is good, but nothing more. I have played it a couple of times, and the expansion definitely improves the gameplay (especially the horrible combat system!), but it's still lacking that "something" which makes me want to play it several times, which has been the case with games like Nations and Clash of Cultures which I love. 
The best part of the game is probably the scoring system; I love that it is, as in Civ, is possible to win by several means, and I've seen my games end by different victories, which is definitely a plus - although some strategies seem better than others, but of course it's not possible to flawlessly balance many different victory conditions. The worst part of the game, however, is by far the combat system which I don't even want to mention as it makes me mad... It's just plain sad to see what is otherwise a decent game being ruined by a rock-paper-scissors system. Also, while it's a "good enough" game, I will just rather play Clash of Cultures or Nations if I am to play a longish civilization game.

I loved the Civ computer games, and really wanted to try this out. When I got this for Christmas, it got a lot of play over the holidays. I really really love the beginning of the game, but the end game can sometimes be a drag. 

However, I always enjoy (quite a bit actually) playing this game, I just need to remember to book enough time to go through it.

When you play against people that will war with you or others, I think the fun factor jumps a few notches. When people play mostly solitaire in their own little kingdoms, it is still fun, but something feels missing.

RATING: 7
So, as far as a Kevin Wilson game goes, this one definitely feels more streamlined and all the rules seem necessary to every game.  But even still, there is not that much different here that really sets it apart from other epic games of civ building.  The tech tree is probably the best part of the game and how it works as a pyramid, with a level 2 tech only requiring two level 1 techs under it.  The other neat thing is how cities count as actions, so you want to make racing to three cities a priority above all else. This causes a problem in the early game, as how quickly you can get your second/third cities going is completely dependent on how badly the map screws you (luck that can't be mitigated) The other worthwhile mention is the four different ways to win: culture, military, economy, or tech (the level 5 space tech).  Of the four, Military seems like it would be the hardest but is needed as a threat and to add some player interaction to the game.  The Bad for this game starts off with the fighting - its way to fiddly and hard to figure out for what it is and unless you have someone to really explain it well, I can see it suffering a good bit for new players as they scratch their heads.  The game is also very long, 4 to 5 hours with another 30 minutes of rules.  You need some snappy players to keep things moving or you may start to stare around the room when its not your turn.  The game also seems like it starts much too slow and there is 0 interaction for the first 1/2 of the game, at least.  All in all, I highly recommend a game of Epic Rune Wars instead of this one for more fun for your time.  

--update: Played again and feel the same. Another observation: how fighting is implemented definitely suffers from the 'gang up on the leader' problem these games tend to have.  I don't really care for the 'laying low' strategy to win.  If you spend your time acquiring military cards (units), then when your forced to fight you lose your strength, sending you backwards from your goal (unless you can manage only 1 attack against the capital).  If you go for cultural, economic, or tech victory, your progress is never lost.  In our game, one person had to beat up on the perceived leader, forcing them to exhaust their cards - then the third player swooped in for the easy military victory.  Losing progress kinda sucks in games like this.

I wanted to like this game a lot.  I wanted to give it an unbiased independent review and not fall into the trap of "it doesn't live up to the computer game for X,Y,Z reasons..."

After a few plays, it's clear that the game suffers from a few design flaws that make it just not fun.  Let's start with the good. 

Things Civilization does well: 
1) It (at least in theory) allows different paths to victory; from science, to culture, to economic, to military supremacy.  
2) The starting civs feel unique and varied
3) the tech tree is wonderful, and the pyramid deign of discovering techs that build on top of previous knowledge is a nice mechanic
4) building cities and upgrading their outskirt tiles gives you a nice feeling of becoming progressively more powerful in the game
5) wonders add powerful enhancements that are truly game-changing
6) the government system is a great addition to giving extra policy flavor to match your needs at the moment. 

Here's where Civ game design falls short
1) The different paths to victory are a distraction.  If you focus on military, you will win the game.  Even if you don't technically take over other capitals, destroying enemy troops, cities, and blockading other cities will basically ensure you have the edge to win.  This game is just a race to see who can do it first.  
2) Some starting civs have powerful bonuses that aid their military power in ways that feel overpowered.  Since military maneuvers are the easiest ways to win the game, civs that start with this type of bonus start with an advantage
3) The tech tree actually feels like it allows progress too quickly.  Tier 2 techs can come out in as little as 2 turns, and Tier 3 techs can come out after the 5th turn.  The higher tier techs are extremely powerful, especially the ones that again, favor military action. 
4) Combat outcomes are poorly designed and it feels wonky.  Instead of distinct units that roam across the map, you get army figures that represent a generic military force, and you keep a standing pool of all your military units nearby.  When you go to battle, you draw cards from your unit pool to create a hand size, this hand size may increase depending on how many figures are in your army for instance, or if you're defending from a city attack.  2 major problems with combat are that the defender can never choose to retreat or avoid risking units in combat, and that the defender is at a distinct disadvantage because they have to play first.  This has profound consequences.  Civ is an attacker friendly game, where someone with a military advantage can always press that with little risk of losing their units, while obliterating a defending force that cannot choose whether to involve or spare their units from combat.  The outcome is that a player who wins battles will keep winning them, especially as their opponent depletes all their available units from combat.  After a battle, the loser has to spend entire turns making up for lost units and figures (which must be purchased separately) and the winner can spend that turn further building their military advantage or making their cities better, whereas the loser can't keep up.  
5) All of this might have been fine, except Civ has one crucial design flaw: it's not a quick game, and if you're stuck at a disadvantage, there really is very little room to build, research, or fight your way out of it.  This means you can be "losing" for an hour while your opponent mops the floor with you.  2 player games are especially bad at this.

Tl;DR - I play a variant where the attacker has to play the first card in combat, and either side can choose to stop playing their unit cards at any time.  (effectively retreating to save units, but still losing the battle and the winner gets all loot, effects)

This game really IS Civilization, I'm astounded at how well the PC game has been converted into a board game. I know that Civ was originally a board game but the PC version has gone through a lot of changes since and the original board game was only used as a source of inspiration for the PC game, after all. But this really is Sid Meier's Civilization come to life as a board game and I'm loving the way it plays - more so than the older board games. This one's got a lot of depth to it but still manages to keep everything "small" and within reach. There's nothing too confusing and the game is surprisingly easy to get into.

Only one playing to date, but it was fairly disappointing. Played slowly (which could improve with experience), but felt like it was superficial in some ways.

Yes, there were multiple paths to victory, but the pressure is all about getting more cities (for city actions). Combat is very expensive (buying cards/units is prohibitive due to scarcity of city actions). 

But my biggest negative is that I felt the starting faction kind of forces you along one strategy (or else you're using a strategy that is suboptimal for your position). For a game this long with this many paths to victory, I want to be the one that decides how to specialize my strategy. Having it dictated by my (randomly assigned) starting race feels like a constraint I don't want in my game.

Still, I'd like to lay again and see whether these early impressions bear out. But with that playing time, its going to have stiff competition for table time.

Let me start off by saying that I love Civilization the computer game. I can think of no more fun or challenging experience in computer gaming than playing Civilization. The battles are exciting, and developing your grand civilization is a rewarding way to spend an afternoon. 

The board game reminds you of how much book-keeping the computer does for you automatically. 

First is the setup. I bought the earlier incarnation of the Civilization board game from Eagle Games, so I knew that I wasn't in for a simple game. When I saw the dials for each of the Civilization cards, my heart leapt for joy. No more counting coins. Armies weren't represented by individual pieces anymore. The ranking of units looked streamlined. Everything looked much simpler and cleaned up than the Eagle Games version. 

Unfortunately, there's still a LOT of moving pieces and cards to this game. Our initial setup took about an hour to get everything sorted out. Sorting through the tech level cards was a bit of a chore because some of the colors look very similar to each other (blue and green for me). There's one space-age card that is special and needs to be kept out. Each of the improvements is double-sided, so figuring out which went to what piece on the market board was challenging the first time around. Then there's the cultural cards and markers, resource markers, government cards, wound markers... the list goes on and on of markers and such. Granted, everything has a place, and is well defined, but it takes some getting used to in order to set up quickly. 

Once the game is set up, you place your city, scout, and army, and then begin the game. Unfortunately, by the time we got to this point, I was already thinking if we had played the computer game, we would have been playing about two hours through by now. Had their not been the strong correlation between this game and the computer game of the same namesake, we probably would have overlooked this. Alas, for us the temptation to chuck this to the side and play the computer game was too great a temptation. My soldiers found a village, and after leafing through the combat rules, we gave up. 

I'm positive that the rules for this game are vastly better than the Eagle Games version of Civilization. From what I saw, it was streamlined, and potentially a fun game. Be prepared to take over 4 hours to get to the point of having fun with this game. If you have the patience to persevere, you can likely find a great game. Maybe I'm getting older, but I don't have the patience to play a game that takes this long to get to the good stuff, especially when the computer version is a few clicks of the mouse away. And the computer is so much better and faster at set-up, book-keeping, and clean-up.

Rating after 1 play.

The game does a great job recreating the feel of the computer game. It scratches the same itch as say Through the Ages, but a little less fiddly. 

Kevin Wilson has a winner with this one. I think this is my 2nd favorite game of 2010 right after Moongha Invaders.

Most of the components are excellent except the Civilization Sheets with the dials just made of card stock and really ought to have been of the same thick card board as the rest of the pieces. I found the military tech images difficult to differentiate and should have been made a bit clearer. I think a lot of care will need to be taken with the Army Flags. They seem to be made of a fairly brittle plastic and are rather delicate. 


This is a civilization game done right.

Possibly my favorite game. I love the computer game, so I decided to give this one a try. It was a huge hit with my friends as well. Only downside to this game is it is so big that it takes at least 2-3 hours to play, 45 min a player, add on an extra hour for a new player, and probably a 4+ hour game if its your first time. 

The expansions add a great deal to the game. I would highly recommend buying the expansions if this is your type of game.

It's like Alien Ascendancy, but not in space. Players need to look at other empires to make sure they are not too close to winning, and look to determine what type of threat that person would become.

Super fiddly ... and in the base game only, I found the combat system dull, long and uninspired ... for the full civilization, there seems to be no substitute for the computergame. (Even though there are plenty of inspired and genius historic 4x games ...)

Mirrored after the computer game of the same name, Civilization is a pretty solid game as long as you have time to commit 3-4 hours to playing (in my experience). I found the military aspect of the game to be lacking, but perhaps if I focused on it more then I would enjoy it. Both times I've played I focused primarily on technology as it seemed like the easiest way to win.

After about 5-6 plays i must say that this is a real gem. I have mostly played 2 player games and it really ticks alot of boxes for me and my regular gaming buddy. I love the theme, the mechanics, the flow of the play and how you can win with every winning condition. Im looking forward to playing this alot more and preferably with 3 or 4 players. One of the downsides of a two-player game of civilization is that it tends to be quite defensive as one big loss in a battle can determine the outcome of the game (it doesnt need to but its highly likely). Also some civs seem to be a bit OP. Im especially thinking of the chinese with their abillity to resurect one unit after combat wich is a huge advantage in a 2-player game. All in all i love the game. It really feels like civ should and im looking forward to many more plays.

RATING: 10
This is a wonderful game about civilization. The quality of components is beautiful like usual FFG standard, with some of the arts come from Civ V the PC game. It really captures the gameplay of Sid Meier Civilization (in PC), with some of it are streamlined for boardgame. There are:

- City outskirts (and resources around it)
- Buildings
- Modular map
- Tech Pyramid (brilliant idea!!)
- Wonders
- Great People
- Asymmetry player (civ) power
- Multiple winning conditions
- Some luck, but easily mitigated with good play

All of the 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) are presented here. Although it bears the same theme with Through the Ages, surprisingly it's very different. SM Civ focuses on parts where Through the Ages only touch it lightly. It's clearly a great game. 

Also, this is rare for FFG, but the base game is completely balanced! There is really no need for expansions, except for more culture cards and civilization choices (Errata and FAQ's still needed though). But that's minor.

Although they are different games, I feel like I could give the same review to Civ as I do for Dominant Species. The game itself is very well crafted and balanced.  Its great and it feels very much like playing a toned down version of the computer game.  However, because its based on a computer game, a lot of time is spent calculating numbers and, much like a multiplayer computer game, waiting for others players to make their actions. Its a great game, but its not good enough to where I feel like making a 3-4 hour commitment to playing it.

Rated an 8 now after a couple of two player games, but it could easily drop.
Both games were decided by turn order as we both finished our tech trees at the same time. It's a waste to play such a fiddly, long game and have it decided by who went first that round.
I think that's just ridiculous.

Tentative rating based on one three-turn solitaire familiarization play and one three player incomplete play (I think about 60-70% complete).

Ripe for expansions, too!

This game is "janky." In other words, there are a bunch of mechanics that feel awkward when you actually sit down and play with them.

Also, there are huge gaps in the rulebook regarding how things work, and believe me, you'll need to look at the FAQ.  

And this game is also extremely long. But every one of my 4-5 plays has resulted in a tech victory. There is nothing less satisfying after 4 hours than watching someone research "Space Flight" or whatever to bring home the win.

Civilization building for players who love to play loooong games. You can try and win in 4 different ways: cultural, economic, technological or military. It is possible for different players to achieve victory in the same game round. The game does not provide for any tie breaking rule. This can lead to quite some discussions. But it's not bad really that the players themselves can choose how they resolve ties, and whether or not breaking a tie is necessary at all. Why would it not be possible for several civilizations to share victory? After all, countries are better off working together instead of trying to dominate eachother. Of course, it would be nice if the rules were to stipulate the fact that players have to decide before they start how they will resolve ties.
Battles are somewhat strange due to the trump rule. Spearmen trumping tanks? Don't think so. But seeing how your civilization expands is very nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's difficult to teach this to anyone who's never played the videogames, but it does quite accurately create a simplified version of most of the mechanics.  My main complaint is that more playable civilizations should have been included with the base game, or that small box expansions of extra civilizations should have been released.  Including America next to Ancient Egypt and Rome is Bizarre.  America is not a civilization.  Another main complaint is that battles aren't very well executed until you add the Wisdom and Warfare expansion.  

The expansions are really almost mandatory, but integrating them requires that you remove content from the previous games which is tedious and leaves you with a stack of components that barely fit in the original box.  If this was rereleased as a single "big box" or "deluxe" version with both expansions built into a box they fit with a fancy box liner and a few bonus civilizations it'd make the top 10 list for BGG for sure.  So they should do that!  It saddens me that such a good game gets so little attention because of these minor publication oversights.

RATING: 7.5
After buying this, it was months before we actually played it; the sheer number of components, the length of the rulebook, and the scope of the game were very intimidating.

When we finally did sit down and play it though, we ended up loving this game.  Exploring, building, upgrading, amassing troops -- it's all quite fun.

As far as complaints:  Like I said, the rulebook is enormous, and could've been way trimmed down.  Also, the game is a bit on the lengthy side, even with just 2 people (though everyone takes many of the actions simultaneously, so it doesn't feel as long as it is).  Also, it really sucks that the troops you'll be deploying in battle are randomly drawn from your hand of standing forces; I would much rather assign certain troops to a specific front than rely on luck of the draw.

Overall, I really enjoy this game, even though I was sure it was going to be a chore to play. It hardly makes it to the table though, it's just so complex that it's daunting to re-learn all the rules.

RATING: 6.5
I miss the micromanagement I could do in Through the Ages.  Here, you don't manage your resources, happiness, food, etc.  Instead, you just decide which you will spend that turn.  

I enjoyed it, but I felt like there was too much waste.  What I mean is that each city can only do one action per turn.  You can use your Hammers to produce something (building, unit, Wonder, etc.) OR you can harvest (usu. only) one special good OR claim Culture.  Because of this, the game essentially rewards specialization.  I focused on Trade, so I could research technologies (I was the Russians), and never even claimed any Culture the entire game!  This waste seemed unrewarding to me.  I felt like I was on rails with my strategy.  It wouldn't have been viable for me to switch to Culture production or Coin production, for example.

I'm not sure how I feel about the combat system yet either.  I miss the elegance of TTA's.

Some more thoughts: 
I like how in TTA, I USE all the technologies I get.  In Civ, often, I felt like I was just searching for the best tech simply because I had the trade to spend.

Civ has significantly more luck:
--random draw for starting civ (see my "rails" comment above)
--random military unit draws.
--random Culture card draws.
--random Hut and Village spoils.
--random terrain exploring.

That said, I do want try it again at some point and see if my feelings change. But, it would have to be a spectacular game to make me want to play it over Through The Ages: A Story of Civilization.

Update: With Clash of Cultures out now, I have no desire to go back and try this again.

Only played it once, and I know we messed up some of the rules, however, this game is pretty fun. I was about to give it an 8 but I don't feel it got quite there. The only reason I would turn down a game is because of how long it takes to play. I felt the culture track was too over powered and the technology took too long, but everything balanced out for the most part. I had never played the computer game, but everyone else had and said it had very similar mechanics as the computer game. I would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of Age of Empires/Civilization type games.

RATING: 8.5
This game has so much to offer in terms of playability and options, we didn't even manage to see everything on the first playthrough. The gameplay resembles the Civilization computer game a lot, except now you can actively discuss alliances and trades around the table, rather than in front of a screen.

The only 'downside' I've thus far noticed is that once someone is on a road to victory, the only real way to stop them is by going to war. When played with 4 players, the one who is nearing the end before the others may well face 3 armies at once. I put downside in quotation marks, since it can easily be avoided, but it's not necessarily something I'd see civilizations do. In one game I won by cultural victory, but one more turn and I would've been annihilated by the other players. That doesn't give me a fulfilling feeling, as my 'civilization' would be doomed in the end.

However, the game is great and I don't regret having purchased it!

Takes a significant amount of time just to learn how to play. Learning this (along with the Fame and Fortune expansion) from the rulebook is not for the timid.

The game itself absolutely does what it sets out to do... simulate taking a civilization from modest beginnings to world dominance. There are many paths to victory and a pretty wide open world to explore and exploit.

But it's a huge amount of work to play it. There's absolutely fun to be had and strategies to ponder... but if the fun factor could be compressed into a shorter time and some of the fiddliness lessened, I'd be able to bump up my rating a bit.

EDIT: Nope, our group just can't do this one. Even though everyone likes it, the game just takes way too long. We have 5 players, and it's 6-9 hour slog for us... and twice now we've sort of rushed/conceded the ending without playing all of the last round.

Maybe we all just like to think too long about our options... I can't imagine playing this game in 3 hours with 5 players without dramatically rushing every single decision.

I like this game.  It is a vast improvement over the first attempt at doing this.  The board and components are very pretty, and some elements are overproduced (by that I mean they could have gotten away with less, saving the balance for future expansions--i.e. kudos for giving us a little more value).

The problem is that there really is only one way to win, despite the 4 supposed paths to victory.  Coins are just too easy to come by.  That said, the game is still very fun to play, as long as the other players are aware that they're in a coin race.  

I look forward to expansion.

Update: The expansion nips the econ victory in the bud.  Now there are more ways to win, but collecting coins is no longer one of them.

3 player game, played for 3 hours until I literally had a meltdown and freaked out because I couldn't take it anymore.  Probably had another 4 or 5 hours to go so it was a mercy killing.

Sid Civ is clearly a labor of love.  The amount of detail is mind blowing.  Things kinda worked: exploration, tech, I didn't even mind combat, I never really understood combat but whatever.  City upgrades and Wonders were interesting.  Special dudes and culture whammies and tech powers and cards and tokens and tokens, cards, cards, tokens, tokens, tokens, more cards a few more tokens (*INHALE*) and of course, Civ specific powers.    

But here's the thing.  There are at least 4 different currencies to track, convert, spend.  By the time I quit, I had to process on at least 20 different little fucking power cards with sometimes two or three different uses each.  I imagine this number doubles or triples if you play to completion.  Never mind paying attention to the other players, win conditions, or even your own future planning.  This was pure treading water and hoping either for a quick rescue or a quicker death.

The amount of minutae fiddling, visual noise, and mental clutter demanded by this game is absolutely stupefying. 

It is almost like someone said to themselves: "I really like playing Civ on a computer but I hate the way it counts, shuffles, randomizes, moves, jostles, every little goddamn piece for me.  I want to do all that myself, manually, forever." 

Sid Civ is a game I think I would have gone bonkers about in college.  Now, cranky old person that I am, I feel that if I live a good and virtuous life, I will be very lucky and happy to never have to see or play or think about this game ever again.  

The worst gaming experience of my life.

It isn't a bad game, but the expansion and bad rulings have reduced it from what it started out being.

RATING: 7
Replay value for the randomness is high, but there is obvious balance problems that someone with more plays will have a leg up on strategy. There are technically 4 ways to win, but because of the balance issue, I've found rushing the technological track is the fastest way to win.

Other than that caveat, the game is a fun reverence to the PC game.

After playing half a game (we had to quit early), I really feel the need to adjust my rating. At this point in time I really don't care for long and fiddly games that feature a lot of negative player interaction. I should find someone who wants my copy because I don't think I'll ever want to play this one again.

Oh, how  I wanted to like this game. But in the end, this one isn't for me. I guess, there's a good game in here but it is hidden under layers of fiddly rules. I just wish this had been streamlined a little more and the event cards had been dropped altogether. I find it really frustrating to get my carefully laid our plans disrupted by the play of a card I could not prepare for. Also, I don't like the possibility that one player can become a kingmaker.

Another bloated FFG monstrosity.  I'm not all that fond of civ building games.  They're usually just too big, with too many choices/decision trees.  I'm never sure which choice to make, and when I do choose, I'm usually wrong.  Don't get me wrong, there was some fun there, but I am starting to realize that I am something of a minimalist when it comes to games.  Less is better.  Which makes most FFG games the antithesis of what I really like.

I was with quite a bit of anticipation I finally got to play this game. I'm a big fan of the computer version and really wondered how that would translate into a boardgame.

The verdict is so-so. On one hand it manages to give you that Civilization feel in a couple of hours but on the other hand it misses out on some of the vital points of civ. You can't get it all I guess, but still a pleasant experience and  a game I'd gladly play again.

My main gripe with the game is the way combat is conducted. Way too deadly for those involved. As it is now the one that never fights a fight has a huge advantage in the endgame as cards take so long to regain.

With another combat mechanic this game would rate higher.

I liked the game...I think.  Definitely need a few more plays to make up my mind.  Right now, my rating could go up as much as 1 point or down as much as 2.  Is there enough strategy, or is it just a fiddily, chaotic race?  How scripted are the different nations?  How much will play time come down with repeat plays?

I taught the rules and found it to be a challenging explanation.  The rulebook is good, but there are some ambiguities.  That said, this is a complex game.  This is no euro.  In fact, I'd say it is definitely more complicated than Tresham's Avalon Hill Civilization.  And for 4 newbies, the length is very comparable to  AH's Civ.

This game is fiddly, lots of special effects on cards with weird timings.  It has a good chunk of "Surprise...take that" mechanic thrown in which can sometimes laugh in the face of strategy. Hopefully with more plays, the tech and culture cards will become more familiar and mitigate the chaos.

That said, I do like me a good Civ game!  Hope it goes up from here.

Update: Second play completed in 6.5 hours.  It's a fun game, but I'm worried about the cascading effect by a player that has some bad fortune militarily.  If one player loses a battle and a big chunk of their standing army, then the game implodes.  The weakened player's cities can be taken...thus robbing them of their few remaining military cards.  Now they have even more trouble rebuilding (buying cards) due to lack of city actions.  This leaves their capital exposed.  Ultimately it becomes a race to see who can knock out the weak player's capital.

Update #:  Had to downgrade it from 8 to 7.  Just too many moving parts. Economic strategy is too strong.  Plus expansion puts in more moving parts!  Fun game but exhasuted by the end of it due to too many seperate cards/pieces.

Sid Meier’s Civilization: The Board Game (SM’s Civilization: TBG) was bit of a surprise for me. I am a big fan of the computer game series, but am not normally part of Fantasy Flight Game’s target demographic (with the exception of Arkham Horror, Battlestar Galactica, and Chaos in the Old World all of which I own and enjoy), and had largely dismissed the game based on that perspective. At BGG.Con I ended up trying the game mostly at the prompting of a geekbuddy whom had been a good sport about trying the games I was interested in, so I figured the least I could do would be to give this one a go. After the game was over, I became intrigued enough by this one that we ended up playing it again the same day, and again the following day, racking up three plays over the course of the convention.

The game itself adheres to the conventions of the game, with enough streamlining that it works as a board game. Many aspects of the game have been abstracted down to a basic level or removed entirely, leaving a game that catches the essential nature of the game without taking the many, many hours that a more faithful translation would require. Wonders, a tech tree (of sorts), buildings, an initial fog-of-war clouded map, and unique civilization powers are all present, allowing for a real Civ feel.

The game’s structure itself is pretty simple. The game is divided into five straightforward phases, each of which has a small number of available actions you can take. The complexity comes from the depth of decisions that you can make within those phases. For example, during the technology phase, the only decision you make is what technology to research. That decision however is so deep that it can quickly overwhelm players who are new to the game. Early games are likely to run a bit long because of the time it will take for individuals to absorb the vast amount of options that are available, but I suspect that after this happens the game can be finished in a fairly tight 3 hours.

Further plays caused a rapid decline in my opinion of SM's Civilization: TBG. The game is an excellent adaptation of the Civilization-video game but my frustration with the sort of depth and nuance you can get out of these games has declined, resulting in a similar decline in my opinion of this style of board games.

Chalk up another missed opportunity at a playable civilization game. Predictably Fantasy Flight falls victem to more of their baroque-yet-inelegant design choices. Rather than inject any abstractions, FF has us literally turning dials and counting up icons turn after turn, as if players enjoy the tasks computers do in the PC version.

On the plus side, they did neatly handle the battles and also did a bang-up job on the tech tree, the most essential part of the game experience. 

As per FF orthodoxy, there are tons of tiny text on tiny cards. Also the standard few viable paths to victory (that might or might not be balanced) and a too-large-dose of unstructured negotiation. Fanboys with excess free time on their hands might rave, but for the 4+ hour playing time I'm skeptical this one is ever worth the time investment

Ieri sera partita di prova con la morosa a Sid Meier's Civilization  Shocked 
Spulzello, imbusto le carte, mi giro verso la fidanzata e: 
"Lo proviamo??" 
"Certo!" 

Le sceglie gli Egizi e io i Cinesi, il manuale lo avevo letto per due giorni circa e quindi grosso modo il più me lo ricordavo a memoria, ma nello spiegare il gioco a lei, guardare un po' cosa potevo e non potevo fare, entrambi ci siamo dimenticati di usare le caratteristiche delle nostre civiltà per tutta la partita... 

Iniziamo esplorando le varie zone limitrofe, depredando villaggi e barbari. 
Spiegato che vi sono 4 modi per vincere, nessuno dei due si è puntato su uno in particolare ma abbiamo sviluppato tutti le strade, tralasciando all'inizio quella militare. 
Verso metà partita punto forte sulla cultura e arrivo velocemente a metà, mentre lei puntava un pò più sulle tecnologie, forte dell'elevato numero di punti commercio attorno alle sue due città. 
A fine partita, rendendomi conto che non ho mai usato l'abilità dei cinesi, che mi avrebbero dato più punti cultura avrei vinto molto prima della fine della partita ma ormai... 
Quando decido di puntare un pò sul militare lei mi segue a ruota per evitare di scoprirsi, allora educatamente le faccio fuori uno scout, un grande personaggio e le distruggo due edifici con una carta. 
Lei, mascherando non troppo bene uno sguardo omicida, incassa e mi nuclearizza una città, purtroppo per me quella che mi produceva più cultura tra le mie tre a disposizione... questa mossa mi rallenta nel rush finale, facendomi arrivare ad un solo punto cultura dalla vittoria, ma ha permesso a lei di costruire la quinta tecnologia e vincere...

Me and my Wife love to play this game, before this, I have played on some way a Sid Meier`s Civilization video game. But the board game makes it good translation of the video game. The way your civ and win on multiple grounds makes the replay and wanting experience. It may be a very large scale and long game, but every time my wife, friends and I put it on the board, makes time fly bye!.... I recommend it if the idea of a turn base strategy game makes you jiggle inside!.

I'm a big fan of the computer games, so this comes naturally. Although it deviates quite a bit from the "source material" and simplifies many things, it manages to creates the feeling of creating a civilization like no over game does. I miss the variability of buildings, units and resources, that the PC game offers, and I don't like the simple combat system either. Also, if you want to win, you have to pick your strategy early on and then stick to it for the rest for the game, which makes it a little boring and demands for intensive planning. These critics aside, I just need to love this game because of it's theme, rich amount of choices, direct inter-player conflict and the sensation building buildings and amassing stuff.

Not sure where I sit on this one yet.  I've played 3 games and it feels a little dry so far.

A decent implementation with a few niggling problems.  I like the fact that there is very little downtime in the game, other than watching other players resolve a combat.  I also like the tech pyramid concept, instead of a tech tree.   Turns go by quickly and the game keeps you engaged throughout.  I also admired that there are 4 different routes to victory and VPs aren't an element of the design at all.  It's also nice to see FFG using a higher quality plastic instead of the cheap bubblegum plastic they have been using.   My complaints are about the massive amount of book-keeping that the game requires.   You are constantly counting up small icons and adjusting dials.   That's not a good thing when going from software to boardgame.  Culture is represented in the game by increasingly powerful "take that" cards, and the theme kind of falls apart in that area - it doesn't really make sense.  I also found the text on the cards (wonders, especially) very small and impossible to read from a distance.   So, in the end, there are some "user interface" problems with this game, but at a macro level it plays pretty well and I would be willing to play it some more.

Far superior to the older Sid Meier's Civ game from the early 2000's. But still the only civilization game I can put my weight behind is History of the World, inasmuch as that game does not have "take that" abilities that can destroy an entire turn (or more) of production for you. Still I will play this game if entreated to, but I will never suggest it.

It has everything that you want in a civilization game, name it wonders, great person, culture&arts, military, nuclear, trade, production, government&politics, etc. You won't notice the time passed by as you're fully immersed in the theme/gameplay.

The tech tree is an interesting part of the game. There are four ways to win the game, one is to reach the end of the culture track, second is to advanced in the level 5 tech tree, third is by economy, and fourth is by invading another player's capital. It seems hard to advance on the culture track (except for Chinese) but the expansion fix this.

The board game implement the video game version with the same name, brilliantly.

It's a much better version than the original board game version of Sid Meier's Civ, but in gameplay some of the victory conditions seem easier to get than others.  I'm concerned about the balance.  Military - tech seems to be the way to go, where economy is very difficult to achieve.  

EDIT:  From reading the reviews, apparently the economic victory is the one that people are thinking is overpowered.  I don't know about that, but it's not really a game I enjoy anyways.

admittedly i'm a Euro guy and i'm not the target audience for this game..... and with the right crowd i might consider it a 3.

but serious AP issues, coupled with take that card play, and continuous beat on the perceived leader and/or weaker player issues, before you deal with the fiddly minutia of turn management. it leaves little for me to like or recommend.

i'd rather do my taxes.

forgot to add - a combat system that while unique just added amazing amounts of unnecessary play time and left 2 other players doing nothings. Sadly, it likely could have been improved with some creativity...

this strikes me as the type of game that could have used a professional developer to smooth out the issues i highlight above...

A pretty good representation of Civilization. I found I could pretty easily teach this to new players, but everyone found it a little aggravating that certain buildings could only be built on certain terrain types.

That said, I will very fondly remember the two games where I nuked my friend's city into oblivion.

I am a huge fan of most Civilization themed games and the fact that this one is modeled after the computer game we all love, got me itching to play it.

RATING: 4
I've tried this game twice. Once with two players, and once with four.  Both games were pretty misserable.

First of all, the game is very long.  I does keep you pretty engaged, since it is a million little actions.

With two players, my opponent had the chinese and was able to just charge me and crush me with military.  Even though my cards were all better, he would never lose anything, and I would lose one.  It helped that he started with 3 - 3s and I had to upgrade my military through advancements.  I also lost a few cards to barbarians and he was crushing the barbarians.  Perhaps if everyone started with 3- 2's, it would be ok, and fix this, or if Chinese were not allowed in 2-3 players.

The 4 player version, literally turned into a kingmaker game, where the last turn one of the players got to clearly pick who he wanted to win (not himself) by either canceling an event card or not.  After 3 hours of playing, it sucked the game came down to such a small decision.

Rating this game as a 1 based one I would never play it ever again.

Edit: To be fair and honest. The expansions seem to actually address some of the glaring weaknesses of this game, but I still maintain it is just aweful out of the box.

Mostly does what it says on the tin. A few unlucky events at the start of the game (e.g., being bounded in by water on both sides; a bad draw of unit cards vs. a village) can effectively take a player out of the running, however, and late-game city management is perhaps longer than it ought to be.

I've moved on from playing 4X games on table; prefer them as isolated experiences against a computer AI. Why they thought they could capture the magic of Civ in a boardgame is beyond me. While everything may work (I'll keep allegations of brokenness out of this comment), I didn't find it very fun. It's one of those hybrid euro-AT games that doesn't satisfy enough of either. Too long, prone to player elimination, and the combat system may sound good on paper but in practice, it's tedious. For my money, I prefer the way Through the Ages treats the entire subject.  

***

So this play ended up creating a WBC story that I'm sure I'll tell for years. I was two coins away from winning. All I had to do was switch to Feudalism and hopefully pull a Great Person with a coin from the cup and I could win this turn. Woo hoo! Except I then realized I had read "Fundamentalism" as "Feudalism". I didn't have the Feudalism tech! OMG. Well, at least I could pull a GP from the cup of GP for a coin. Where's the cup? Why can't I find it?

Time freeze. Memory flash. A sick feeling in my stomach. What's happening? Why am I remembering how I cleaned the table of debris including some cups... cups... CUPS! Oh crap, I threw out the cup that had the Great Person chits! Oh crap! Run to the bin. It's a new bag; they cleaned it out! Find maintenance; go to the trash bin. I'm outside with Doug (the owner of the game) and we're standing in the rain tearing open trash bags and digging through trash trying to find the cup. It smells. I'm getting wet. Uuuuugh. I finally convinced him that we should finish the game and I would contact FFG for replacement pieces. He agreed. Then he assassinated one of my GP's with a coin and I was out of it at that point... And I did get FFG to send him a complete replacement set of Great People.

RATING: 8
Good-looking FFG Civilization game with modular board. I like the variable tech tree system a lot, and there are different ways to gain victory (economy, science, culture, military). Not everyone likes the somewhat random combat system, but I'm fine with it. Some players find the constant counting of cities' production and trade value frustrating, too. Variable player powers are nice. Wonders seem to be too weak? Anyway despite it flaws, I like the game: it's a solid 8 by me.

Fantastic game. Especially with the expansions. There are so many avenues to victory and so much to explore. My only complaint is that going military in a 2 player game really hems you in on options. Overall, great great game I can't get enough of.

Jeebus there are a lot of chits.

—————————————————


2011-02-26

11:33 AM

I have one complaint about the components. The chits, cards, figures, etc can be divided as follows: player pieces (color-specific - cards, figures), character pieces (leader-specific - civilization card and culture track marker), and community pieces (wound markers, buildings).¹ Most but not all of the pieces fit nicely in the categories of player pieces or community pieces, but there the two leader-specific pieces do not. It would have been nice to been able to divide the pieces more simply when storing the game and I feel it could have been much simpler to learn if this distinction had been made in the rule book.


1. The resource markers *seem* like they are community pieces but a careful look at the rule book reveals that one set is placed out per player, meaning they can be placed with other player pieces.

My main complaint about this game is how much it bogs down towards the end.  In spite of that, I enjoy how many ways there are to trigger the end game.  I also like that the variable race powers don't completely dictate your strategy if you want to win.

RATING: 8.5
Sid Meier's Civilization is an outstanding civilization game.  The four ways to win give multiple paths to victory.  It seems that the victory path taken depends not only on the chosen starting civ, but also on what happens over the first several turns (if you get famous leaders, the wonders you can get on the board, what resources are available for the second city, etc.).  Even so, most of our games have been very close, so the victory paths and different civs seem to be pretty balanced in my opinion.

Can't wait to play more.

Muy entretenido. El juego se basa en el árbol tecnológico, hay que saber más o menos lo que hace cada tecnología porque unas se apoyan a otras y eso es determinante para elegir una estrategia u otra. Así mismo, cada civilización es propensa a un tipo de estrategia u otra, por ejemplo, los rusos funcionan muy bien con la estrategia tecnológica. 

Que los jugadores interactuen más o menos depende de la estrategia que elijan, pero si no hay ninguno que elija militar se puede convertir en una carrera en solitario hacia la victoria. 

Llevar la cuenta del comercio y la producción se atraganta si no tienes algo a mano para anotar. Hay buen material para eso en la página de la BGG del juego, en la sección de archivos: diales, tracks y cosas de esas que hacen que la pega del conteo constante desaparezca. 


La discutida mecánica del combate a mi me parece que para lo que es el juego está bastante bien, no estamos hablando de un wargame. Además, como tienes que robar al azar las unidades que combatirán en las batallas, has de planear bien tu ejército, tanto en lo que respecta a miniaturas como unidades. Esto hace que en lo militar no valga la estrategia "más es mejor", tienes que currártelo más.

I didnt really see the need to upgrade my units at all as you are so far away from the other players there is rarely any combat. Combat mechanics themselves are really disappointing as it is basically rock paper scissors :(

Culture is nice but you end up playing cards because you can rather than because there is a strategic value to it.

Tech victory and coin victory are subtler,  as it is difficult to keep track of how many coins or what tech a player has without asking them every freakin' turn.

Not my sort of game, but I was interested to learn it. We played as 2p and Mike knew it well enough already to give me a pasting, plus we agreed at the start not to attack cities (I'm no wargamer). I was most interested to see how it differed from the PC game, and whilst there are similarities, there is no tech tree; you need only support a higher tech with two lower, in a pyramid stack. I made various mistakes, mainly in the choosing of my techs - I didn't get irrigation until 2 turns after getting my scout to place I wanted to build my 3rd city - I left engineering late in the game so I didn't benefit from splitting to buy 2 military units. But I made a creditable stab at it and got near the end of the culture track. Mike was a few turns of getting the 5th level tech, but morphed into collecting money, so he won earlier than we reckoned.

I did like the game, but I struggle to see how you can win without ramping up your military. Mike's Egyptians got a ton of free buildings and that gave him a constant edge (he could use production on units instead), so I was never going to win. I thought there was some waste; the culture cards seemed feeble and some tech was blank/worthless or hard to gain from. I'd like to see a 2nd edition with gamer tweaks. The military battles seemed dumb, RSP is not a good tool. The board design and resource wheel were well made, and there's a lot for non-gamers to try, but this is really a game for hardened gamers and grognards.

It's not perfect, but this is still the civ-building game I've been waiting for. Knowing which path to victory you're going to take, and committing to it, is essential. I've played with 4 and 5, and I think I prefer 4. The 5-player map is weird, and buildings and army cards run low. I'd like to play with 3, but am not really interested in trying 2.

I've played with almost all of the expansion content now, and I like it a lot, but won't buy either of the expansions until we've played our own copy of the game a couple of times at least. I'm curious to see what I would miss and what I wouldn't. From what I understand, a Culture victory is pretty much impossible without the expansion.

I'm planning a "base game only" introductory game with 2 or 3 friends. Looking forward to that.

RATING: 6
Multiplayer direct conflict in spades with all the accompanying problems.  If you consider yourself well within FFG's target market, I'd recommend it highly.  For myself, I believe I'll strongly favor only 2-player after exploring the multi-player a bit. Too much feels out of control and I feel like the game relies a little too heavily on players to play "right."  Still, it seems like quite a lot of civ in a somewhat reasonable play time.  

The main thing this game lacks in my opinion is interaction on more levels than military and random culture cards.  When I play this game, I feel like I'm simply playing my own efficiency game depending one what famous people, nation, or cards I'm dealt.  At some point you look to defending yourself militarily or putting pressure on other players, but beyond that everything feels pretty much like you're just doing your own thing.  I'd prefer a "civ" game to give me something like Innovation where cards like gunpowder screw over cards with castles, or banking screws over cards with industry.  Each aspect of a civilization has it's own strengths and weaknesses not just military.

Another traded game. And again, not a bad game, but just not what I wanted from a Civ game. Seemed more about managing your money than it did on anything else. Honestly, it felt to tactical. I personally would think a Civ game would be a grandscale, strategic game that would last across the ages, rather than "Oooh! My 1 single city has a Market now, and it's like, the year 500ad!" Again, a very well balanced, thought out game. But the lack of anything BIG was kind of a downer for me.
Another beef is the fact that the world feels so small for what the game tries to do... Seems odd to me that you can end the game with Space Flight and there still feels like you've yet to even begin to explore your own world (what is beyond those boarders of the map? No oceans to cross, no new countries to discover...) Would have been better with a huge poster sized world map, less buildings, more cities that could be upgraded (grown) rather than improved through individual buildings. Missed the Civilzation across the ages and kept it smaller scale. Killed the theme for me.

In the couple of times playing, the game felt quiet balanced, which is a big up side. But I got it for the theme as well as the game and it just didn't work for us.

RATING: 9
 I think this is superb design that captures the feel of the popular computer game very well. The way combat is conducted with the 4 sided army cards and the variable stacking limits is uniquely brilliant, rewarding the person who invests heavily in a military strategy without making each battle a sure win. The way a tech-tree is built strikes the perfect balance between being overly complex and not having enough choice, and the production values in this game are top-notch. The main reason I only rate it a 9 out of 10 instead of the full 10 is because even at 5 hours, the game can feel a little prematurely truncated when you've been working towards one or two victory conditions the whole time and are almost there only to have victory snatched away by someone else fulfilling a different victory condition just ahead of you: this is a race to the finish! I'm also not entirely sure how balanced each of the winning conditions are yet. But I eagerly look forward to playing this a lot more in the future, and with the excitement building from my boys, that shouldn't be hard to do.

My first real civilization game.

It was a good experience, but I was expecting a little more.

Complaints:

1. Setup takes too long.

2. My biggest complaint: It is too hard to keep track of all the powers that buildings, leaders, and wonders give you. I had a lot of moments where I regretted not doing a useful action which I missed because I didn't feel like checking 20 different card for useful effects at every moment.

No complaints:

1. Combat. Many don't like it. I did.

2. Complexity. Honestly, I don't think it is nearly as complex as people make out. I learned the rules very quickly.

3. Length. It's long, but given the type of game it is, what else would you expect?

The first games were great but I consistently encountered things I don't like to have in games:

- The more the game progreses, the more it clogs.
- Take-that style of playing the culture cards
- Combat system looks smart but it's just as random and basic as dice, except it takes 10 times longer to play.

I wish I liked the game, because it has the perfect theme, but I don't. Traded away.

RATING: 5
Another multiplayer conflict game from FFG. The game captures the flair of the computer game quite well, and it's commendable that with resources gathering, natives, tech trees, buildings, wonders, and of course combat the whole package stays fairly clean and housekeeping is kept very low-key.

Then again, you have your typical multiplayer conflict issues. It is once again a game where players need to keep each other in check until there is either kingmaking (whether through deliberate actions or carelessness), or until somebody has to win because everyone's just that one step away. There is also no way to win through generalization.

And even though Civilization integrates many secondary aspects the primary concern is moving your units around on a map. The resource gathering is extremely simplified, the tech trees are kind of disappointing with a lot of redundancy and nothing in the way of preconditions, and cultural advancements seem to be useful as a flanking strategy at most. What it comes down to, therefore, is military strength, either as a direct means for a military victory, or as a requisite defence and determent.

Sid Meier´s Civilization is a typical FFG board game with alot of good and bad things. But at the first place, it´s a mediacore building/strategic game. In the Vanila version of the game (without expasions), it´s pretty hard win a game through the economic strategy. So, if you want to play a balanced good game, you will need a first expasion. If you want to play a good game with deep combat options (mechanic of picture trading from core set isn´t funny at all), you will need a second expansion. Typical FFG selling strategy. And yes cutting content from the game and sell it as an expansion is a way too.

Civilization: The Board Game has a lot of good ideas going for it.  I really like the 4 Victory conditions and that each and every one of them had other reasons to pursue it other than victory alone.  The tech pyramid idea has a nice growth feeling to it (though some of the names of the techs and their effects are so unrelated to each other).  The battle system is a bit wonky but I can't think of anything else like it and so it actually worked for me by and large.  Buildings and Wonder construction and effects were fine too.  But this game is so fiddly, with such a growing amount of text by the end, that it becomes a bit unapproachable.  I was quite enjoying it at the beginning as it is a rather comprehensive game that works very smoothly.  But by the end you have about 12 Techs each doing something else, 3 cities that have grown so much that you're constantly counting tiny little symbols.  A hand of Event cards that could be used at several key times and likewise you have to keep your eye on your opponents who have equally grown in immensity.  As such, there is a huge amount of mental bookkeeping that has to go on in order to make sense of the endgame state.  I think this would work just fine for those who play the game regularly and are blown away from the mechanics.  I myself, like the mechanics and I know that I won't be pulling this one out often due to the headache.  I've only played it 2-player and I can't imagine 4-player, which is certainly best (so there is a negotiation aspect) but I can't imagine the downtime and total game length here.  Just not what I'm in to.  Oh well- again, a fine game all things considered but just not my cup of tea for what I'm looking for in a civ game.  I guess I just like more Euro mechanics to avoid some of the sprawling mess that games like these can find themselves in.

Love all the civ computer games, love this game. Takes a long time [~90 min / person]. Totally worth it with the right people.

I have heard this gets significantly better with expansions (particularly WW). I will have to try that sometime.

The game could definitely use a few tweaks though! Here are the few tweaks I would make next time I play:
(1) All coin techs now read (max 3 coins) instead of (max 4 coins)
(2) 16 coins are required to win rather than 15 (i.e., turn dial back into the coin symbol)
(3) Barracks building provides no trade instead of 2 (final form, +2 combat)
(4) No wonder limit in a city - how un-Civ like is that?

Rationale:
(1) Economic victories are a little too easy. This helps slow it down a turn or two and makes the player actually plan. ;)
(2) See 1
(3) Barracks are the best trade buildings. That's just silly. Barracks are the best building period. Also silly. By the time you have academies, trade doesn't matter as much so they can stay.
(4) Seriously. Civ is all about building 10000 wonders in one megacity and ruling the world from there. Note that this does not elimiate the 1-starred building rule, that one is needed for balance. Lastly, this is also a minor boon to any culture victory pursuers out there, which probably isn't a bad thing. Time will tell.

I've kept this in my collection despite enjoying [thing=40765]Clash of Cultures[/thing] more often for my Civ game fix.  It feels like a Euro-4x hybrid which isn't entirely a bad thing. I think it would get more interesting with 4 players but I mostly play with 2, which makes it somewhat less compelling when compared to a 2-player game of CoC. Nevertheless, I keep returning to this game a few times a year and I'm always learning something new from it. I'm also pleased with the fixes and gameplay additions that the expansions have provided.

I've only played this as a two player game, but would like to try it with more.  Fortunately, it's proving pretty popular amongst the people I usually game with, so I will probably get the chance sooner or later.

A strategy game in its purest sense.  You must carefully craft your civilization "engine" so as to utilize your strengths while protecting your weaknesses.  If you are good at this game I'm sure it's a joy to play.  If not it could be 6+ hours of frustration.  I'd play it again, but not something I'd buy for myself.

This game is an admirable attempt at a boardgame translation of the classic computer game.  However,I am a Civ II diehard, and have never appreciated the additions of the later games (many of which are incorporated in the BG incarnation). Additionally, the boardgame iteration suffers from the typical FFG "and the kitchen sink" hodgepodge of mechanics.  Considering the time investment, I found myself preferring to spend my time with other F2F games.  In the end, my Civ itch is better scratched by the  computer.

RATING: 9
Rating went up from 8 after further outings.

All in all, I'm very impressed by the game. It's a very well done conversion of the computer game - basic structure and goals are the same, yet the design is tight enough to keep the game in reasonable length. All the game mechanics seem to work and some - like the tech pyramid - are actually very clever. Calculating your best build for each city and deciding what tech to buy next can sometimes stall the game for a bit, but otherwise everything flows forwards very nicely.

The game length will certainly be an issue for some, but it's worth noting that gameplay itself feels both constantly engaging and surprisingly fast-paced. In the first game, I was surprised how soon all the players started to look like they were knocking on the door of one of the victory conditions. Shortly put, it does not feel nearly as long as it is. And with experienced players, our three-player games have clocked around 2-2,5 hours.

Actually kind of liked this at first, a Through the Ages with a neat spacial component. Then the randomness of combat and culture cards cropped up. Take-that in a game of this length and heft? Add to that FF's standard bombastic design style, and you've lost me.

RATING: 4
This game is not bad or in any way broken, per se, it just has a lot of elements that I don't like about civ games.  Some offenders that come to mind:

-Overly involved mechanisms that increase play time but add little flavor.  For example, the combat mechanisms are reasonably complex but superfluous.

-Limited strategic options.  You have 4 paths to victory.  There are clear paths (techs, behavior) to get to each.  There aren't any creative or unexpected combos.

-Straightjacketed strategies based on initial choices.  This game initially seems to have a lot of choices in it, with a cool tech tree.  In practice, many of your strategy decisions are made for you the second you pick your civ.  Each civ is associated with a single type of victory.

Most importantly, I rate on the BGG scale---do you want to play it?  Answer is no.  Clash of Cultures completely fired this game.  I would never play this game over it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So far this game has a lot of promise. It's a long game, so be prepared. There are enough opportunities to make bad decisions that new players should play an introductory, abridged game before diving in.

There's a lot to do in this game, lots of different paths to victory, and a ton of replay value. The game manages to offer a lot of meaningful decisions and ways to play, but also has been pared down so that no particular system in the game feels cluttered or bloated. 

Overall the game feels "worth it" despite the long play time, just make sure everyone in your group will be a good sport and see it through to the end.

One the "richest" games I've ever played. It feels so complete, so many things to do and quite tense. I don't give it a ten due to some imbalances in 1 vs 1 depending on which civilazations are in game (Greeks would have a lot of advantage that way) and overall due to how long it takes to play it...it can last a whole night...which doesn't mean I am eager to play it again:P. it is one of these games that is hard to hit the table..but when it does it is just so amazing.

I enjoy Civ-building games pretty much. For me, this is the perfect match for Nations - both games do the same and are totally different at the same time.

I got one of the 240 Essen copies. I had good vibrations, when I read the rules, which are easy to absorb. But still everybody was really surprised how well the theme, mechanics and theme fitted well together. I might had rated it higher if it had been shorter, but the turns were very quick and I never got bored, as there was always something to plan and think about, I was slightly worried that the war element would turn me off, but there were not too much confrontations and they mostly felt quite okey to handle for everybody and nobody felt overrun.

I won a very tight economic win as Bismarck. The Russians and American had max 1 turn left for a tech win and the 4th player could have gotten a culture win in 4-5 turns,

The game wants to do everything at the same time and all the elements you expect to be in a civilization type of game are represented here (although some parts are weaker than others). Most of the game seems to be decided what you do during your city management and research phases. There are four goals in the game and you have to focus on them, but still not be vulnerable to threats from other players.

I like the game more as an experience than the actual game. When playing the game I set up a strategy from the start and then focus on achieving my goals.

Too much of a Euro for me (i.e. you need this to get that, but more of that gives you more of this, especially if you have this special ability). Also found it particularly frustrating in that some civilization didn't seem as capable as compared to others.  Good luck trying to play with that handicapped civilization.

Played twice. Once with 3 and once with 4, an hour per player. It is harsh to rate this low as I think it is an excellent design of the computer game. It captures the experience and is well implemented. However it is just too long for me. I find it tiring to keep up with what everyone is doing. I can't be bothered trying. I am into the hobby for the 90 minute elegant Euros, I enjoy the odd deviation from these and CIV certainly provides that but it has only served to re-confirm my euro credentials. June 11

An intriguing early game leads into a disappointing mid and late game. We spent a lot of time scratching our heads while reading through the (typically FFG) rulebook. Once all the tiles had been explored, things got stale fast, and we were suddenly just buying technologies until we won the game. One of the biggest questions on our mind was why this game was designed with a maximum of 4 players in mind, when the source material is generally played with 7 civilizations. It felt like there would have been more here if we had had more ways to interact directly with eachother.

This is a game definitely guilty of trying to do too much with too much. Multiple paths to victory, dynamic diceless combat mechanics, exploration, technological advances with sweeping effects, military conquests, and expansion are awesome when it is some of these. All of them is just a bloated and tedious mess. I cannot think of a time where I would not rather spend the 3 -4 hours just playing the computer game.

I was eager to try this iteration of a Civ game at BGG.con.  When I finally found an open game starting up, I jumped in.  We all chose our starting civs, and set up for play.  In passing, several people who'd already played chimed in that my Russians and another player's Chinese were unable to win the Russians, and that was only because the Chinese player failed a capital assault by only one strength point earlier in the round.  The races and governments seemed very balaced and well differentiated, actually.  The Russians ability to steal technology, was also great.  It had me only a couple of turns from winning via technology.  

What is nice about the game is the multiple paths to victory.  Two of us pursued military (me tech as a secondary), while another came close via culture, and the fourth struggled the whole game, but only because he was being dogged by the Chinese player.  He was actually the only one to play before and explained the game, so theoretically had a better grasp of strategy.  

This is now on the wish list.  Look very much forward to playing again.

Update: I have changed this from 9.5 to 10 after having played a four-player game last weekend, and this game just keeps on surpassing all expectations. I am simply loving it, and think it is near-perfect both as a two- and as a four-player game.

I want this! Rather, I need this!

Update: I needed it, and therefore I got it!

Update #2: This is Kevin Wilsons best game yet. Yes, I know he made Arkham Horror (brilliant), Warcraft 3 (brilliant with expansion), Android (moodily brilliant) and Descent (simply absolutely brilliant), and Civilization beats these.

This is not Ameritrash Through the Ages, a type of game which I am looking for, but have yet to find. This is its own AmeriEuro, and it works.

Played at TotalCon. I was India, and I played thematically with Gandhi by focusing on culture and ignoring military. We didn't quite finish the game, but I think I was going to be able to pull out the victory. I had some culture cards that were going to help me avoid fights, and I also got lucky and had two generals from random great leaders.

The game is well designed. There are tons of interesting decisions to make, and I like that there are multiple paths to victory. The rules were rarely overwhelming, which is impressive considering the complexity of the game. It helped that we were playing with someone who was very familiar with the rules.

It felt like it took a really long time for our civilizations to start interacting, but that was mostly due to the time to explaining the rules, and slow first rounds as we figured out the mechanics.

All in all, it's one of those great games that I'll probably rarely play due to the length and complexity.

One of the first video games I had was Civilizations2, and since then I had and enjoied every new version of Sid Meier's Civilizations. I was a bit afraid that a tabletop game based on a so loved videogame series could net be as good as spected, but I was completelly wrong: This is one of the best Strategy Tabletop games I ever tried, and it keeps almost all the aspects of the videogame in a perfect way.
The different strategies during the game and the good balance between the different ways of winning the game made it different every time it is played.

Es un "estrategia 4X" puro, aparentemente no muy complicado pero bastante denso y complejo. Requiere cierto aprendizaje por parte del jugador para no cometer errores graves que condicionarian su partida.

RATING: 6
The tech works, and the powers and victory conditions seem relatively balanced. That is no mean feat. That and the reasonable playtime (~3 hours) amounts to a significant accomplishment.
That said, though, the start player advantage on some turns is stupidly advantageous. As in, it is far too likely to determine the game's outcome. It is also the case that the game, for me, suffers from its immediate competitors--namely Antike and Through the Ages. Sure it's got a map (unlike TtA), but q.v. the turn order problems above, and it also introduces all the standard problems of multiplayer conflict games. In addition, the random map setup can hose players in terms of founding their crucial second city. So I'd rather take TtA for engine-building Civ goodness, and Antike for light Civ goodness with map-based conflict.
All in all, a near miss, but largely due to my own personal preferences.

I think that this is an excellent reproduction of the computer game, with some (necessary) simplifications to reduce micromanagement and calculations.  However, it's still pretty long (it could use computerization!).  It would take a lot of practice to get a 4-player game down to 3 hours, I think.  But it might be easier to convince my game group to play this than Through The Ages, which has a lot of micro-management.

I hear that the "get 15 gold coins" strategy always seems to win.  It also seems that the military strategy is basically a distraction -- the attacker will cause the defender to waste time rebuilding defences, thus giving someone else the game.

It's interesting to note that although a winner is easy to determine, the remaining players probably don't have a "ranking", because there are different possible victory conditions.

I'm a fan of Alpha Centauri. I think the scope of the Civ games is too large for their own good and the overall result is a bit too silly (which turns me off). Tried this at a friend's house. What is quick and easy on the PC is annoyingly slow on the board. Not enamoured with the plastic minis. As such, I find this a bit redundant overall. This type of gaming is simply better on the PC, which handles much of the bookkeeping for you.

There is a lot going on here, and a few games are required to grasp, let alone rate this title.

As a 2-player game, there is a runaway leader issue, but it's OK if all you want to do is learn the game.

As a 3-player game, it's OK if all three players have relatively the same experience level (ie. a new player might be an easy target for a Military victory).

As a 4-player game, the players are the balancing factor and can mitigate a runaway leader.  The game is also more forgiving if you are relatively new to the game.

With multiple paths to victory, and a lot of options, this is an excellent game, although some might find it too long.

Expect Analysis Paralysis from new players.

As I understand it, it is to provide a rich, thematic, and mechanically sound civilization game that speaks to hundreds (if not thousands) of years of inter-, trans-, and anti-cultural development (and by anti-cultural, I mean way). This game provides multiple avenues to victory and a great deal of avenues to support them. The goals seem relatively balanced so long as everyone knows what to pay attention to and for (e.g., military build-up, cultural leaps and bounds) and is willing to meta-game (what would a game of civilization be without some table-talk?). For me, this game does take a long time but it doesn't feel long as it moves along at a good clip (so long as no-one at the table suffers from analysis paralysis) and since some of the goals' benchmarks can't be tampered with (to my knowledge, I'm talking about culture), the game clearly mounts towards a climax of some sort. Also, I find that the games aesthetics are clean, simple, functional, while still being nice to look at.

RATING: 5
Not bad, although early mistakes can put you out of the running with another couple hours of play left... not a good thing. I had a somewhat painful learning game. I'd give it another shot though.
----
A second play has not improved my opinion. Combat is the big issue. While it's quite fascinating for the combatants, it slows the game to a crawl for everyone else and adds some serious downtime to an already lengthy game. And while it seems there are a lot of tactical choices to be made, it's possible for luck of the draw to completely overwhelm those choices. I'd give it a third try, but I'm not optimistic about it.

Complex, but rewarding strategy. Plotting with and against friends never gets old. It captures the essence of the video game magnificently.

Take your time to learn, play a few sessions, and if you like conquest games, this is a keeper.

I only wish it came with enough pieces to support a 5 or 6 player game.

RATING: 6
By now i played this quite a lot. It is very complex and it really shines if everyone knows the game in and out.. and played it at least 4 times.. then the real meta-game can develop.
Otherwise you simply romp into the capital of the newbie and that's it..

__________________

Let me start by saying that i admire how they kept all the good stuff of civ the computer game & simpliefied/modified the things you cannot translate into a board game.
This game gives you the same feel by offering you the four different ways of victory, via tech, military, culture & economy.
Even the fighting they implemented beautifully, with some bluffing & a decent portion of strategy.
My only one big drawback is that it's very long. Because although the game starts rather quickish, the turns are getting longer and longer, because you need to think about what to build/do in every of your 3 cities, what you need for that & where to put your pieces accordingly. And this is consecutively.

If you're a real buff & know what all the buildings & wonders & governments & techs do.. turns might be quicker but i doubt a game length under 4-5 hours. Add a person with AP and we're talking 6 hours. And that is a game length, that at least for me no game can make up for.
________________

Dropped from 7 to 6 for the length & the fact that it's hard to find that many dedicated players & the usual leaderbashing is kinda annoying.

Buen juego de civilizaciones pero muy inconsistente en el aspecto temático, especialmente por los edificios. Hay poca variedad y no van acordes a las diferentes épocas. Puedes tener, por poner un ejemplo, armamento nuclear y acueductos en tus ciudades. Al ser de FFG imagino que sacarán miles de ampliaciones y en alguna de ellas rectificarán este tema. Entonces, puede que lo suba de puntuación.

Civilization building as a theme isn't probably my favorite (I've never been much into Sid Meier's Civilization or other games similar to that) but because of Through the Ages and its great reviews I've decided to give it and some other similar games a chance to impress me. I haven't played this yet, but I will, probably soon.

RATING: 8.5
The game is very enjoyable, takes a long time but worth it. There are some balance issues though. Without any expansions culture victory is hard and there is little you can do to prevent coin victory. With both expansions better (just first makes culture too easy), but Great Person deck makes some of them exceptionally good on right occasion. Less abstract than Through the Ages. Also I think the terrain should have a bit more effect on the movement. It feels like after several rounds it ceases to have much effect as you can move over water tiles.

If you like to have map and move things on it and less abstracted then check out before over TtA.

The theme is brilliant, and also the components and art. But my first play was 5 hours and I had only 2 tech II levels. I hour of explaining the game. There are a lot of rules to understand in the first play. So I just played it and just trying something out the the Germans. We didn't finish the game but the game mechanism are good but you have a lot of down time for waiting what other players do during the game. Yes I enjoyed it a lot!

This is a very fun game, but only with the right group.  Players must be serious gamers and willing to devote 4-5 hours to a single play.  Otherwise, the game is enjoyable and strategic to a point.  There are multiple paths to victory; however, this is a bit misleading as each civilization has an optimum path based on its special abilities and starting tech.

Ugh! See, here's where the wheels come off of the BGG rating system bus. Sid Meier's Civ is a very good game; I've played an awful lot of it, and always had a good time. But Clash of Cultures has completely decimated my desire to ever play Civ again. There are some games where you think, "Well, there's room in my collection for two games that are similar, but stake out different specialties." But here, everything that Civ does, CoC does better. Victory paths, tech, exploration, combat, city-building...

I can't bring myself to rate Civ down, 'cos it is a great game. But I really kinda doubt that I'll ever play it again.

I found it a bit too messy & have other games I would rather play when I want to play a long, empire building game (mostly those by Martin Wallace & some of those are short).  

Other thoughts:

Dice would be quicker & cleaner for combat.
The theme doesn't really work although I hear that's what the computer game is like.
Tech pyramid is a good idea although some of the techs are redundant.
Having multiple victory conditions is good, although I'm not sure how balanced they are.
There is a fair amount of bookkeeping & calculating levels of multiple resources which should have been more streamlined.
I didn't feel much turn angst - didn't seem to be a 'tight' game.
Limited player interaction.

... I am glad I played it though just to understand the system.

Played 1 learning game with the wife. Really enjoyed all the different possibilities that the tech pyramid gives each player. With 2 players the map is a little small so Spain power only worked for the first 3 turns (when exploring a new tile, build any building for free).

Played a full 3 player game with the expansion. Game time was over 4 hours! We played pretty slow and rules explanation took a bit. Probably a once or twice a year type of game.

RATING: 4
Although it has a civilization theme, really this is an economic snowball game, where the idea is to gather resources, use them to buy 'buildings' that generate more resources etc. All of that means that a small early lead will turn into a massive lead by the end of the game, with the only levelling factor being the ability of players to attack one another. The knock on effect is that a tech victory is easily the best way to win as this creates a strong military while gunning for a cultural or financial victory will leave you too weak to resist when those enemies come to call. I've been deeply disappointed by this, you can be put out of contention quite early and there's still three hours to go!

RATING: 6
As with most civ games (incl the computer game), I like the idea of it more than I like the implementation. I do like parts of it but on the whole it's pretty slow and what really kills it is that it seems like there would be optimal strategies that don't vary a whole lot from game to game.

This feels a lot like the PC game and I love the PC game. There is a lot of variety to the game and to the way it can be played. It is a long game so doesn't get played often but I enjoy it when I do get to play. The only downside, and it is a major downside, is the amount of space required to play this game. I can barely fit it on my table with 2 players.

This focuses on the parts of civ games that I find less interesting (war, exploration) at the expense of the parts I find more interesting (balancing growth with production, building up something cool and big).  I'm sure it will have its fans, but I'll stick with Through the Ages. (1 play)

RATING: 9
Own all expansions
Definitely loving all the interactions (destroying building, killing wonders, putting people into anarchy, military attack, cultural attack etc etc etc) and the retaliations. Tons of fun!

The game, however, lasted a little bit too long for me. My game group lost focus after 2 hours, then it took really slow since then; maybe it's just our problem.

Nevertheless, it's still one of my all time favourite! Please try it out if strategy planning is your type of game. I will always be down for another game if you ask me.

RATING: 9
Prepare yourself for a long game - first timers should expect a game time of around 6 hours (especially once you include a quick pizza break!).  However, it's worth it - this game is pretty epic.

Far more tactics and depth than I could describe here, the game challenges you to turn your small band of scouts and warriors into a civilization that trumps your opponents in either technology, culture, wealth (sort of) or military clout.

The main things I really want to say about this game, is that I really enjoyed the fact that although the game is very long, you don't notice much downtime.  There's lots to talk about with the other players when someone is taking their turn, and often you can take actions to block another player's movements when it's not your turn also.

A massive game with epic replay potential, grab some beers, pizza and some mates and get stuck into this brilliant game.

(Quick recommendation - get everyone to read the rules the day before you play, it will make the setup and explanation much easier)

This civ game focuses strictly advancing to one of the 4 win conditions: money, science, military, and culture.  This ends up focusing mainly on use of the map, and tech, but leaves out the population management of the computer game.  Interesting game, but combat feels a little off.  It seems like science is the easiest road to victory.  I think through the ages captures the computer game theme better.

second game... still just got in 5 or so turns. got combat this time, which seemed neat and not scary - a minigame with interesting enough choices to be essential but not over or under-whelming to the main course of gameplay. overly complex, perhaps, but i love the open-ended trading (non-binding promises should be worked into all games) and variety of choices. still don't really have a full game experience, so i don't know how the various winning conditions play out / compete so the rating may go up or down based on this.

third play, most complete game yet. got all the way up into the last stages - major war ended in a tie! looking forward to the next game.

---

okay, nope. 3 player game took way too long. decisions become much more taxing in the latter part of the game. we're going to try and speed things up by keeping a cheat sheet for our cities - there was too much counting. but i am lowering my score because it was brutal and took forever - granted, one of the three players was significantly slower.

okay, i played it again with three players. i won by technology victory. had sheets to track tech pyramids and city statuses, but still was overly taxing toward the end. a good game is here, but it is a grueling play.

Rating after only two plays.  First time was not a whole game.  Two of the 4 players were painfully slow which meant we ran out of time after 5 hours and had to shut it down.

Need to try this a few more times with players who aren't so AP inclined.

Tycker om spelet, gillar de olika sätten att vinna. spelsystem är bra.

Time commitment to play is the only issue  for my play freqency... often only have 2 hours for games night and the 60min +30min per player often makes this game ruled out for play. Which is saddening.

4 players. Did not have time to complete a game. Really like that there are multiple paths to victory. Additional flavor with each civ having a different power and various purchased improvements granting others. The simplified combat system is fun. Looking forward to playing a full game.

RATING: 6
1 play.

At first the pace was fast, players' turns were quick and really enjoyable. Very very pleasant feelings.
BUT with every hour of play the game was slower and slower and it started to draaag mercilessly from some point... :-/// Players were bogged down in choices and longish battles were no pleasure at all...
The game became very very tedious towards the end...

Battles are by far the weakest point of the game.  Long, overcomplicated - they make completely no sense in a game with such a strong economic aspect.  They should be SIMPLIFIED.

Decisively - no buy for me.

RATING: 7
A very good game, so close to being a GREAT game. The technologies add a bit too much AP, leading to a lot of downtime, despite every player only having 1-3 actions per turn.

Aside from that, there are a few balance issues with the different win conditions, but not enough to make it unenjoyable to play.

RATING: 8
Well, well, what do you know. Kev & FF get it right afterall, mostly. I think its probably their best game since TI3 AND it might be better AND could even be their best game....I even bought a copy after playing and I barely buy any new games these days. Not too fiddly as I worried it could be, at least for FF and as I mentioned before in my pre-comments a good CIV game can't avoid being at least a little or it wouldn't be a true CIV game, play was mostly intuitative and flowed well too. 

Now note that I have only played once so far and it was the short game with 3 players, which I think hit a sweet spot, at least for me, was about 2.5 hours and I know the next game would be 2 for sure and I had this confirmed by some other players. Also, I am an old fan of the computer game and I can tell you that [i]this game brought back some memories[/i], yes, playing does bring out the feel of the old beloved. (I also have not yet played TTA oddly enough so can't compare)

The short game does concern me though, in particular the Culture track seems way too hard to climb for the win, more experience? or maybe a tweak needed there, not a biggy anyway. I also wonder if the income track is a bit on the easy side but I think the 3 other than culture are close. Wonders seemed hard to get in the short game as well, really the game is just ramping up when the short game ends which really makes it almost a different game and really with the rules as written you will need the full game to bring everything to fruitation (a tweak to the short game might be to start off a little advanced or something to mimic the full game better, more thought on this after more plays...). 

Combat, well this was the weak point of the game for me and maybe the only significant one, other than the length of the full game which I hear is about 4 hours. It started off bad when units were randomly given out (why not give equal to start?) and then the rock, paper, scissors aspect was a bit alarming. At the beginning of the game the first fights were silly really, just tit for tat and whoever got dealt the crappier units lost (usually you against a tribe at beginning) BUT it did seem to improve as the game progressed with upgraded units, more units, other bonuses etc. So right now, this is my big question mark with the game, we did not have a lot of combat since it takes a while to ramp up and this is another concern with the short game as by the time you do ramp it up, someone will be ready to win somewhere. I think the short game could use a few small tweaks (more plays to confirm though), but then, I think most games could... ;) or worded another way, most games [i]improve[/i] with some small tweaks. 

Anyway the rest of the game was really well done I thought and very enjoyable. Wonders are really cool, the tech tree was really cool(might want to take out the NUKE card), buildings give more resources and are upgradable, the income/trade dial was a cool design, the culture track (those cards though?), multiple paths with 4 ways to win, mostly lower luck (combat has it, not sure how much yet though, shouldn't be too bad and it would seem even in the full game combat is a more minor element in the game) so overall I was quite pleased with the game on one playing of the short game given my hesitations with FF at the helm of this, its a very strategic game actually (you can plan your tech tree start to finish for one example) and I look forward to my next game. 

[u]Update:[/u] 8.5 => 8 Played the full game 2 player. It was LONGGGG and goodness two player only. I guess we were slow players, really there is enough look ahead that the game just keeps you thinking, this is great but has the negative effect that goes with it. 

I think I am okay with combat mostly and how it works, once the game gets past the initial stage. Not sure about when someone's city gets snuffed out though in the later stage, boy that sure is hard to recover from and what is with Atomic Energy and just nuking a city because you randomly found the right token under a tribe?  Nahh, we put that silly Tech out, I like the theme behind it but now how it was implemented or the effects!  

I think I am okay with the Culture cards even as they mostly just attack buildings as their one screwage element which isn't too severe. I don't like the tradeoff of one of them, getting a resource and it gives someone else a coin, and I don't like the Tech that when you get 9 trade value someone else gets 6 (should have been 4?) but these are very minor nitpicks. Overall I think the luck level is fine except for the Nuke Tech.  

I can see a Combat issue in the Multiplayer game for sure where attacking someone and depleting your forces leaves you and the person you attacked wide open. So while I think how combat works is okay I just don't know how well the results of Combat sit with me are, whether someone loses a City late in a long game and can't recover and/or whether the first person to have a major fight leaves himself and the defender vunerable, opening the door for the lying cat. This and the game length are really my only issues with the game, but they are kinda big ones. I REALLY like the rest of the game though so I'm torn. I am thinking about a modified version of the short game that somewhat simulates the full game a little more.

This game just took way too much effort to get into. We constantly found ourselves asking, "Why don't we just play Civ V?" It is a beautiful game though and beneath its intimidating demeanour I can tell that there is a lot of fun to be had with it. I may try it again if the world runs out of electricity.

RATING: 7.7
Finally had a chance to play this at Origins and my feelings on it were definitely up and down. To be fair, I paid to play in one the GF7 events and the guy who taught us was either deliriously tired or slightly drunk, I couldn't be sure which. Seriously. As a result many of the rules were introduced during the game AFTER someone tried to do something they shouldn't have.  We didn't even know that we could trade resources with one another until halfway through the game!  I was very frustrated with the rules explanation.

I decided to battle some barbarians right away.  Battle had not yet been explained at all and I just wanted to know how it would go. I got romped and lost all of my units. I then took a beating from one of the other players since I had no cards to defend with and subsequently lost all of my army pieces. I was a tad PO'd at this point and it took quite a few turns to get units and armies back. Just an hour into the game and I had decided that I really didn't like this game and I in fact wished I could quit. 

Luckily I stuck with it, learned the game as we went and figured out how I would play the NEXT time. I even somehow mananged to win despite getting way behind early on. In the end I did like the game, it was just marred by a very bad rules explanation.

**One of those rares things where I've only played once and it wasn't even the greatest experience, yet I can't stop thinking about the game five days later.  Reread the rules and moved my rating up a bit.**

Later got this in a trade and I have to say that the only thing keeping this from being rated higher is the steep learning curve. Not that the game is hard, it just has a lot of little rules that are easy to forget and the combat system is so....wonky.

**UPDATE**After seven plays I have to say that this is a pretty fantastic game.  The combat system is still a little odd but it's the thing holding this game from being a 10 rating.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable Civ game.  Explore the board, build three cities, get tech, build improvements to the cities, fight armies, multiple paths to victory.  Can win by conquering a home city, or by winning the tech race, or by winning the culture race, or by winning the coin race.  Has tech fun and city building fun of civ games.  Exploration but only for the first couple rounds.  Spatial maneuvering actually rather limited since terrain irrelevant once one has navigation.  Combat is a bit clunky.  Sense of strategizing not well defined somehow, compared to Through the Ages.  Afterwards I can think of plays I could have done better but not really creatively thinking of interesting strategies.  More about responding well to what your neighbor is doing and making good tech and city building choices where it's not necessarily clear what the best choices were even afterwards but it's satisfying to have things build up.

Early impressions:

Pros:
* Map Tiles are thick
* Economics are interesting, interaction with warfare is excellent!
* Tech pyramid > Tech tree

Cons:
* Light combat
* Thin Civ Sheets
* Could use an extra reference sheet for combat (victory results and miscellaneous bonuses).

A great game. Very nice mechanics for an American Game. So far it's my favourite one. It has a lot of variety but it must be played with an appropriate group since it's not an easy game and a rookie may unbalance strenght ratios. Masterpiece!

UPDATE
--2012/11/06--
After many plays I've rated it down by 1 because I consider its rating as an average with the expansion's one. The base-game was great (apart from minor issues which could have been fixed in a different way by the expansions). Unfortunately the expansion hadn't changed anything but worsening the game itself. Even if it gives more choices by introducing ancient ruins, great people and new civs, it unbalances the game dangerously. Buildings aren't useful anymore, as it's mostly a waste of time spending an action(unacceptable for a Civ game). It could have been the best civ game so far, but the expansion faded the theme of the evolution (initially not so strong I have to admit) away.

UPDATE
--2013/11/06--
Wisdom and Warfare is the key!!! Finally this game has been fixed and it is now working very well. A lot of balancing issues have been fixed (thanks to the bggcommunity too), tech victory is now viable.
I strongly suggest not to play the game without the second expansion as it's TOTALLY BROKEN ! It's better to play the base game instead than the Base game + F&F.

Rating can finally go back to 10!

UPDATE

This seems like a good game, but it doesn't seem to be a great game as the current BGG rating would imply. However, I've only played one game so I'll definitely need to play at least one more to come to a firm conclusion.

But overall, this game didn't appeal to me as much as Through the Ages did after the first play.

This game juggles two daunting aspects: massive scale and complexity. Every turn of my first game I skimmed through all my technologies, re-counted my production, peeked at my resources, and was re-puzzled every time. However, these aspects are exactly turning this game from simple, short and boring to great fun which demands devotion from the player. You dearly want that thire city, that level 4 tech or just the one more Wheat token. Great stuff, certainly for the more devoted gamer with plenty of time for the hobby.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (April 2012)

Some friends have told me negative things about the game so it took me nearly a year to play it, I was sure it was going to be a very bad game. Boy I was very surprised!! Civilization is a great game, I just upgraded the rating to a 9.0 and I can´t wait to play it again.

As a fan of the computer games, I feel the board game is a very good implementation of the game system, it can take a while to play but the game flows so quickly you don`t feel the time. I enjoy it immensely.  

The game has a lot of replayability because each time you play with different tiles (and different orientation), different civilizations, different technologies etc.  It has a medium luck factor due to the units and cultural cards but it doesn´t bother me, perhaps the combat is the hardest concept to understand but not so hard.

All in all a great game and a must buy for me.

Right now it is my second favorite civilization game after Through the Ages.

I’m downgrading its rating, as Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game  is no longer a game I would like to play every time, also I’m trying “to obey” the BGG recommendation system, so Civilization is a good game that I’m willing to play, just not every time. Still I think this is a very good to great game.

Perhaps it is best enjoyed with 3 players, as with four the down time can be excessive if a player is somewhat slow.

Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game continues to be my second favorite civilization board game, for a moment there many friends told me they preferred Clash of Cultures over this one but after playing both games, I can say Civilization is the better game by a mile, in fact,  I refuse to play Clash of Cultures again, awful game for me.

I owned this and sold it because I needed the cash, but this is a game I would buy (with its expansions) in the future.

Wow.  Kevin Wilson and the FFG team have managed to create a game that recreates faithfully the feel of the PC games, but plays in a very manageable 1 hour per player.  A completely immersive experience and thanks to the innovative technology paths, a game that seems to have a substantial amount of replayability.

I’m very pleased that FFG decided to put Civilization out at the $50 price point instead of making it a big-box game with lots of plastic.  This game is a fantastic value, just like BSG and Arkham Horror before it.

I have minor balance concerns; tech victory seems hard to attain.  I even tried for one in my second game before switching gears to coins midway through.  I am pleased that I’ve seen the other three different victories in my first three plays; that bodes well.

Edit:  I've downrated this game as I'm less than pleased with the "king of the hill" multiplayer conflict aspect it brings out.  I want to rate it higher but I don't have a lot of enthusiasm for it at the moment.

RATING: 2
Rating based on one 4p play only. NB I haven't played the video game, so this is based purely on how I found the board game.

Turn by turn game play is smoother than I had feared after reading the rules, but it's still a very fiddly spreadsheet-like affair that comes down to efficiency and optimisation without a great deal of interaction, at least until someone kicks off a military campaign in the later stages of the game. You need to invest a fair amount of time learning the various buildings, techs and wonders, how they relate to each other, and how to move through them as efficiently as possible to play well.

I'd challenge the 'quick playing' tag, it's still a long game that for me dragged in the second half.

Also not sure about the military strategy, as it seems strong and (even it it doesn't provide a winner) the player the militarist targets is likely to be knocked out of the running. Fine in a game of Risk where it's all about fighting, less so if you've spent 2 hours focussing on (say) culture and have to take 3 turns out of culture vulturing to ready some sort of defence against an aggressor. Those 3 turns not developing culture will likely put you out of the running for no reason other than you're sat next to the German or Russian player.

It is one of the best empire building game available, in my opinion.

Amazing mix of eurogame and ameritrash, no dices. It is quick for a civ game, probably a bit unbalanced: technologic victory is easier and military power is too determinant.

I tend to have a sweet and sour relationship with civilization games and SMC is no exception. 

SMC Sweet: I enjoy building my cities and dedicating them to culture so as to attract important people.

SMC Sour: Not a fan of tech trees and this one takes FOREVER to build as you can only research one tech at a time; I wish there was a fast-forward button. Since it takes forever to do something, it amplifies other things I’m not fond of like wars. The game also forces you down specific victory paths instead of allowing players to combine their points from different areas.

I don't know the computer game well, so can't comment on if its a faithful transfer to boardgameland.  As a civilization board game it ticks many of the right boxes, which makes me curious as to why it did not engage me more.  In the end its just kind of ponderous.  All civ games involve some degree of abstraction, and the key is if you like the extent of the abstraction and how the abstraction is done.  The tech pyramid is a clever abstraction, but without genuine prerequisites it lacks something.  The whole battle mechanism sounds cool but is actually a bit dull.  If you run out of combat cards then you are really fodder - make sure you sit to the left of the new player so you can take their capital when they lose their units.  In the end, the game is just too dull.  Civ needs to move quicker than this.

Over bloated, over hyped, latest destruction by Corey and crew.  It has some interesting ideas, but the small fonts, the colors (losing sight of pieces on the board happened several times), and the absolute terrible combat system makes this game three hours of watching paint dry.

Perhaps this is common for games of this length, but it feels like Civ is terrifically inflexible. Set your strategy, and hope that it carries you through to a win - because changing your mind mid-game isn't a viable option if your opponent is doing well. And spending your game trying to upset the leader isn't all that enjoyable when it takes 3 hours. If, halfway through the game, you see that you're behind, it's excruciating to have to play out the next hour and a half knowing you can't affect the final outcome. 

On another note, I hate the combat system; why they didn't use dice, I have no idea.

Altogether, not a bad game. Just one that I can't see myself playing much.

FFG's release manages to capture the spirit and feel of the fantastic computer game in a boardgame format. The best feature is a feature which is rarely seen in multiplayer conflict games. It is possible to score a non-military win although military can't be neglected totally as otherwise your civilization will be the playground for the nations with strong armies. As usual there will be the customary leaderbashing towards the end but it pays out that there are multiple ways to victory and not everything can be taken away.
It's a bit on the fiddly side but compared to Through the Ages it stays manageable and it's far easier to follow your opponents actions. With the inclusion of a map it takes a more conventional approach to civ-building than TTA and is more Ameritrashy than its competitor.
Statistics indicate that some of the cultures have slightly better chances at winning and military or economic victories are more often. As with all asymmetric multiplayer games the game balance is in the hands of the players and Civilization should be able to show its real potential with experienced players.
After one play, it met my comparably high expectations for a four-hour multiplayer game.

I played this once when it came out, and then the second time a mere seven years later, but that's no fault of the game itself. I love 4xs, especially with a civ theme, so I own and enjoy Clash of Cultures and Through the Ages, among others. Compared to CoC, this one's a little baroque, and the rulebook is prolix in the old Kevin Wilson/FFG way that we'll probably never see again, but the gist is quite easy, leaving the focus primarily on gameplay. Again relative to CoC, SMC is less streamlined, but I have found the granularity of this appealing as an alternative to rather than a replacement for CoC. I even kind of like the combat system, which should be taught and thought of as a minigame, and WaW probably makes it better.

 I really looked forward to this game as I have always loved the computer version.  The game has the feel of the computer game.  
 I would have given it a 10 but I think the limited number of nations is a drawback.  In addition I think you should be able to have more than three cities.

 The combat system is different but works for the game, however if you lose a major battle look out as you become easy pickings for the rest of the world.

The game on paper seems very interesting. Actual playing however reveals much clunkiness and clutter. Despite the simplicity of the actions each turn, there's just too much to keep track off, especially with all the techs piling up. Still maybe with more plays the game might be better. Combat as well seems a bit poor. I particularly dislike the rock-paper-scissors effect to the units.

Pos-things:
Great game, love the theme, everything works out, the changing map and the random civilization brings variability to the game. Not too much text in the game. The artwork is great and detailed. It has a very different and unique combat system. 
 Neg-things:
Sometimes a lot of rules to remind, a very long game, especially if you consider too much possibilities. Is a game that overwhelms new board gamers. I just recommend this game if you know that someone else will want to play with you. It seems to me that not all the wining conditions have the same effort to achieve, economic victory it’s for me the easiest.

Cosas-pos:
Gran juego, me encanta la temática, todo encaja muy bien. El mapa cambiante y la civilización otorgada al azar le da mucha variabilidad al juego. El juego no tiene tantísimo texto. El arte del tablero y las fichas es también muy bonito y detallado. Tiene un modo de combate diferente y único.
Cosas-neg:
En ocasiones son demasiadas reglas para recordar en un determinado momento. El juego es muy largo, sobre todo la primera vez que lo juegas. Es un juego que satura a jugadores de mesa nuevos. Sólo recomiendo este juego si sabes que tendrá alguien con quién jugar. Me parece que no todas las condiciones de victoria son igual de completables, la victoria económica me parece más fácil de lograr.

A game full of everything. A lot of rules, a lot of strategies, a lot of ways to victory, a lot to do, but strangely, it is not hard to remember everything (at least with player aids included in the box). Fascinating game, which makes you forget the time completely. This probably is the biggest drawback I can see - it takes a lot of time.

One of my top 10 games.  Love the civilization genre and this is king of the crop.  So much about this game that I love: modular board, unique civilizations, multiple routes to victory, and a real deep thematic experience.  No other civ game (outside of Through the Ages) gives me the feeling of truly developing a civilization like this game does.  Plus, I feel it is less military heavy then TtA.  Like all civ games however military does remain the single most important aspect of the game but the culture cards often can negate military advances quite effectively and advanced science can also give advantages to smaller armies.  I will play this anytime with anyone.

The first longer game that I've really gotten into. Civ plays remarkably similarly to its namesake's computer game. You're left with most of the same options and many of its strategies. The tech tree is open-ended and maintains a similar feel as well, which is a huge plus.

The game plays long, of course. The combat slows the pacing down a bit, unfortunately. But it's often possible for players to go simultaneously, which helps considerably.

Rating based on solo play to learn mechanics and explore some of the strategies.

I'm a big fan of Civ games, starting with AH's version in the '80s, several editions of the PC game and Advanced Civ.  I've played Through the Ages and the Eagle Game of the same name as this.

This game could be the Civ lite I've been looking for.  You have armies on the map and a tech tree.  There are multiple paths to victory and the limits to armies and cities mean this game isn't going to take forever.

I worry that poor tile draws with poor city sites may constrain some players, but there are always military solutions to that!  It will be interesting to see how this holds up to multiple plays.

Addicting, every turn feels important.  Has that feeling of Sid Meier's Civ 3 or 4, and simplifying a lot of the game that would have otherwise been tough to calculate in board game version.

This plays really smoothly (especially for a Kevin Wilson game, the man usually loves to make things fiddly). I'm not sure how interesting it'll be after a few plays, but it seems like it could hold up. Not a huge fan of how military works; it's unintuitive and if you drop behind, you can't come back from it (Through the Ages tends to be this way too).

Also, I really really wish Fantasy Flight would drop their silly "if you run out of tokens, you can't do that any more" rule which crops up in every game they publish. It's particularly nonsensical with buildings in Civ.

I enjoy civ-building board games but couldn't get into this one. The combat system is flawed, and the tech pyramid too rigid. I enjoyed the fact that there truly were different paths to victory, unlike Through the Ages.

And once you fall behind in that race, any chance you had for victory disappears.

First played at Sean Thunell's house, Jeff owns a copy.
Pleasantly surprised with how concise the rules were, despite how many options are available, very well written and easy to find answers to questions throughout the game! Intrigued by the multiple paths to victory, seems to lack some tension as each person could potentially not interact militarily the entire game and someone could end up winning by coins or techs. But, more experience with this game would make it better and better I think as players would be more aggressive and try bolder strategies.

RATING: 9
Sid Meier's Civilization (2010) is a whole lot of game. It tasks you with building a winning strategy from a large pool of game mechanics, as well as a variety of win conditions. In the game, you build cities and structures (including wonders of the world), explore new territory, fight NPC villagers, deal with inter-player politics, and more. First time players may feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of possible things to do in any given turn, but those looking for strategic depth and a wealth of possibilities from any one session are nearly certain to enjoy this one.

In any game, a winner will be decided via military conquest, or via economic, cultural or technological superiority. The fact that there are multiple separate win conditions that can be pursued is straight from the computer game from which the game takes its inspiration (mainly, for this version, Civilization IV). The road to any victory is a long one, and the game rewards players who dabble in a bit of everything. New technologies give players stronger military units and new ways to grow their economy; a stronger economy reduces the effective cost of gaining new technology; focusing on culture grants players special action cards that can be used to assist every aspect of the game. Naturally, one also needs to have a mind towards military development, if for nothing else but defense.

Each player plays as a specific civilization: the core game includes the Americans, Chinese, Germans, Romans, Russians and Egyptians. Each of these gets powerful special bonuses; Russians can steal technology, Germans get free military units, Americans have boosts to production, Romans get free culture advancement for doing specific things, Egyptians get free buildings, and the Chinese start with higher defense in their capital. Each player also has a specific government that can be unlocked with technologies that add to specific areas of their civ. The combinations of different civs in any one game can shape the power dynamic dramatically.

The board for the game is a randomized modular board built from 4x4 square tiles. The random nature of the board combined with the different civs in play only dramatically multiplies the variety that any one game can contain. Just in the core game, I've found a level of replayability that I don't often find in games of this complexity and time investment. The production value is also fantastic; the multitude of square tokens reminds me of game designer Kevin Wilson's other creation (and personal favorite), Arkham Horror.

It's not for everyone, as the game generally runs long and there are a lot of different things to consider on a turn, which might be overwhelming. With the right group, however, Civilization is hard to beat. The different avenues of play make repeat plays and experimentation very rewarding. My general play experience has been 1v1 with my wife, and while we stand at a 3/1 record, even when I lost I had a great time playing, and my wife is seemingly always willing to play more. When a competitive game is fun and rewarding even when you lose, you know you have something special.

At first view a well done CIV-Game. Far better than the older version from Eagle Games. 

Sadly a bit too abstract in my opinion regarding military confrontations and the small amount of armies and cities. You really don't have the feeling to build an empire and you can't really hinder one's movement because you don't have enough army tokens to block movement.

But here is one REAL bad point: The combat system sucks. It feels like someone simply wanted to avoid the good old dice and make something especially elegant - but in reality the combat system only feels artificial, random and makes no sense when trying to explain the rules with real-life-situations. AND it is a time killer - it takes much too long to fight out a simple little battle.

Without this crap of combat system the game could have made it to an "8", so it`s only a "6". Everyone of our gaming group likes this civ game but hates the combat system, so we often find us playing another game with civ background.

Amazingly "tight" for a civilization game, made so by very carefully omitting certain aspects (such as happiness, and more than three cities) which had been modelled before and highlighting others which had been somewhat skimmed over (tech trees, individual buildings in cities, great leaders, cultural events) in recent offerings.

This is probably the most successful of the spate of Civilization-type games I've played in the last 5-7 years, and although it has its weaker points (combat is still oversimplified, and the world feels more like a fishbowl than an entire planet), it's a really good design that hits all the right aspects of a civilization building game - the classic 4x model "eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate", while allowing for many possible paths to victory.

05-28-2013 - Quickly becoming my favorite game at the moment.  I would give it a 10, but the military aspect is just too random and rock-paper-scissors-like.  Maybe the forth-coming expansion will fix that, maybe not.  Still an amazing piece of work that I ALWAYS want to play though.

09-05-2013 - Played recently with all the expansions, and it was better, though still not a 10.

11-12-2104 - Got my first game in after a year or so. Lots of fun, but it really does just kind if turn into a race. It's fairly random in stupid ways, like drawing random units in battle so you don't even know if you'll get units you've invested in upgrading. The race is just trying to come up with a win before the technology clock runs out - someone WILL get to tech 15 regardless of skill, eventually it'll just happen. If everyone is an expert and keeps cutting each other down, perhaps this takeaway experience can be mitigated, but I'm just not sure this one is worth such a high score anymore. Down to an 8.5. Sorry civ, trying to move on to something better put together.

One complaint about the gameplay: the combat seems tacked-on. Somehow it just doesn't have a good 'SM: Civilization' vibe like the rest of the game does. I have no idea how it could be done better, but it does lower the score for me.

While this may be one of the most complex games I own, it is unique in that its complexity is fed to the players as the game progresses. This makes it relatively easy to teach newcomers.

This game can suffer from too much AP, and its time scales with player number, but otherwise the struggle to optimize your path for advancement makes this game rewarding.

It's not perfect, but currently it's the best civilization/development game I have.

In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!

Civilization game. Gave this a play through and found it to be a pretty thinky game. Lots of things to track, lots a rules. Like how it all comes together, and found it fun. However I found the battles unnecessarily complicated.

This straddles the game between board and war game (which is good).  In the same genre whoever, I'd MUCH rather play Runewars.  

This Civilization is, although much faster than the previous, still waaay too long and slow, with tons of downtime (maybe better with less than 4?).  Rules are ok but need a FAQ and even then some things are still not 100%.  It's a total bash the leader and/or "I can't win, so lets sabotage the game" affair, with hard to control play (city defense is hard, culture event are a huge monkeywrench, etc.)

On the upside, it caries the flavor / theme of the video game inspiration quite well and has good depth.  It's absolutely a gamers game, with low playability, fair complexity and large scope.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
In summary, it is a resource management game. There are a lot of interesting mechanics in there if you intend to design civ like game of your own. There are also interesting similarity with the video game, so similar that they even transferred the bugs.

In addition to that, I got screwed badly in the game I played. So it does not help to make an objective review. In my case, a player blocked me the possibility to create a third city. Since my trade was very low and I was getting 2/3 the resource of the other players, I fell way back behind with no possibility to win. So as a revenge, I played king making on the 3rd player to make him win.

First, the pacing of the game is very slow and the map design is not interesting. So when you want to move to attack your opponent, it is not as easy as I would like. Personally, I would have unconnected the board. Instead of moving units on the board, you simply select your target city and attack.

Second, your production is the only resource that cannot be split on multiple action (1 technology allows you to split in half). I had placed a city with a lot of production (because in civ games, it is normally good) but I realized that it is completely useless. Of course, I could build a wonder, but I can only build 1 wonder per city. Else I have to destroy my own wonder to build a 2nd one (totally stupid)

The problem is that each city has 1 action. So even if your city could have 10000 production, it does not matter because you can only produce 1 thing. (2 with engineering). All other resources like trade and culture are cumulative, so 10000 of these would actually break the games. This means if you are in a bad situation, you cannot shift all your production to troop creation because you can only create 1 unit per turn. Not only you must produce figures but also units. So you need like 2 or 3 actions to place 1 unit capable of fighting into play. You get in a situation where you must never lose your stating units because it is very hard to recover.

There is also some technology which are essential to make the game work. Irrigation allows you to give a 3rd city. Like I said above, it is impossible to win with 2 cities. So you have a light dominant strategy where everybody must get irrigation. It is possible to win without engineering, but 2 action per city per turn somewhat doubles your production capacity. Personally, I would set that as the default rule.

The other thing I did not liked is that you must focus on a single victory condition through all the game. In the civilization video game, you can normally change your focus in the middle of the game, but in this board game, it is impossible. The worst thing, is that the civilization you take will dictate what should be your victory condition. If you do not focus for that victory condition, you are screwed.

Finally, the board game has a bug in particular that I don't like which is present in all video game. I call it the concept of having technology research proportional to empire size. That has the effect of creating some sort of runaway leader syndrome where that player cannot be defeated anymore. This can generally be solved by making technological research not depend on empire size. 

Still, in this board game, players can at most build 3 cities, so everybody has the same empire size, but if a city get's destroyed or not built, you simply place that player out of the game.

So I am really not impressed by the game play. It's a good source of inspiration for my design but that's all. I prefer playing age of mythology instead since the board are not connected and since you always stay competitive even if bad things happen to you.

The Best boardgame experience ever to me!

RATING: 6
LIKES:

* Diverse tech paths that support different victory conditions bring interesting variation into the game.
* Tiles for land is different each game as they can rotate in differently each time.  No land mass will ever be the same.
* Four different win conditions allows for different and interesting paths to victory and guides one's tech pursuit.
* I like the combat system with the paper, rock, scissors concept and slight deck-building aspect.
* I appreciate that as you learn higher techs, your lower level buildings and army units upgrade immediately!
* Game is streamlined fairly well although there is still a fair bit of accounting that occurs.

DISLIKES:

* Games can take a bit longer than I care to play in general.  Outside of conflict, the game is largely solitaire so waiting on someone else can feel frustratingly long at times.  This almost kills the game for me.
* There is a lot of finicky counting up of icons each turn for both production and trade which can get old in a hurry.  
* The culture and gold chits are pretty small and can be hard to handle.  
* I'm not certain if it bothers me or not, but some of the cultural events are rather chaotic and mean in nature.  Kingmaking is something that can and often will easily occur in this game.
* This is a minor annoyance, but for a FFG, I'm disappointed in the lack of plastic miniatures...;-)  And wimpy flags to represent armies?  Really?

RATINGS CHANGES:  7 -> 6

Ultimately, I'd just prefer to play the game on the computer and/or play Through the Ages so I sold the game.

If you look up "fiddly" in a dictionary, there will be a photo of this game. I really -want- to love it, as Civilization is my favorite PC game series, and this game manages to replicate almost all of the gameplay concepts of its progenitors. However, there's so much bookkeeping to manage and systems to not neglect that it sucks all of the fun out of the act of playing.

I like this game a Lot. After four plays it still intrigues me. It has a pretty high learning curve, so you need a game or two to get the hang of it. From that moment it gets only better. You get a good overview of the game and can focus on how you are going to win the game.
Not so good with two players: when one is winning the game the other can't do much about it.

I've always been terrible at the computer game (the first one, at least; I haven't played one since) and not that great at civ games in general. They're usually pretty overwhelming to me. This one, though, I found manageable and pretty fun. It helped that only one person playing had played before, so we were all on roughly equal footing. I was given Germany as my civ, and since it's such a dumb, brute-force-oriented one I was able to win over folks whose countries required a little more finesse.

Exceedingly disappointing. As a joyous fan of the digital series, I found Kevin Wilson's analog conversion lacking. I attribute the most glaring inequities in the game -- the overly dominant Economic (and to a lesser extent Military) Victory, the utterly infeasible Culture (and to a lesser extent Technology) Victory, the overly dominant Egyptian and Russian Civilizations, the utterly helpless and hapless American and Roman Civilizations, the utterly unbalanced Wonders (...Hanging Gardens, anyone?) -- to a complete lack of playtesting.

Let us be discretely honest, now: did anyone at FFG actually play this prior to shipping? I have profound doubts.

That said, the aesthetic design is of FFG's customary brilliance. But colorful frills, meeple bells, and plastic whistles do not a good board game make.

You're zero for two, Kevin. Better luck next time.

Humbly yours,

Comments entered on 17 May 2012:

Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game has been released for about a year and half at this point. This game has the major themes from the computer game but borrows heavily from Sid Meier's Revolution.

I have been a huge fan of the Sid Meier's Civilization computer game series for about 20 years. I have played every incarnation and was very happy to see FFG get a chance to develop a board game from this license. It was a great bonus that Kevin Wilson was the designer for this game, as I have had a chance over the past year to relay my games played to him and get his feedback on the game and how we have been playing.

I wanted to get a chance to see how each Civilization fared against each other Civilization in a head-to-head match. Aaron Lynch has been willing to partake in this grand experiment. As of this entry, Aaron and I have played 29 two-player games.

Best Civ game out there. Better than through the Ages in my mind since it is less fiddly (less moving small beads everywhere).

Pros:
Tech pyramid is awesome
Different Victory conditions that appears to be well balanced
Plays great with 2-4 players
Plays quick for such an epic game
Uggrading of units using cards is clever

Cons:
Need the Greek!
Military presence is disjoint from military force

This is essentially Civ Revolution translated into board game form.

While I've read comments as to "why would you do that?" I would say this: There are a number of major elements that are different enough to say this is a different experience albeit heavily derivative of the source material. Further the human interaction in the game makes any comparison impossible.

There truly is the diversity of choices and strategy with just enough randomness in the system to create a new experience with every play, requiring changes in strategy every time.

Expect initial plays to be in the four hour range though I expect that to drop dramatically with experience, weighing in at 45 minutes a player at the utmost.

Update:

Length and rules overhead and reduced the "return to" rate, and therefore this drops to a 7.

Rating after one play.  Took quite a while (Six hour two-player game including reading rules).  Ended when my gaming partner nuked one of my cities and I threw in the towel - he would have won tech victory in 3 turns anyway.  It was quite a brain-burner.  It was fun throughout, but I made the mistake of getting into some early military engagements with him and barbarians with only 3 military units in-hand, lost several, had to spend time buying new ones, did it again a couple times...basically wasted my economy buying and then losing military units at least twice, set me behind and I could never catch up after that.  Moral - make sure you have a hand full of military (and some bonuses) before you start getting belligerent!  Anyway we'll see how rating holds-up after a couple more plays.

A game that does capture the feel of the Sid Meier Civ V game.  It is 4X game where you explore tiles that scale based on the number of players.  You gather resources, build armies and attack your opponents.  Each civ has a different set of special abilities.  This base game has an issue though that is fixed by the first expansion, it is far too easy to win an economic victory and a cultural victory is almost impossible.  

Regardless, the game is good and I would own without the expansions.  It is very fiddly and complex to teach.  You are looking at 1 hour + to teach.

This is an amazing game that is expertly balanced and really complex. You really do feel like you ARE those civilizations, and everything makes logical and thematic sense and is actually very intuitive. 

Lots of strategy and only a little luck, just enough to help re-playability and give you unique situations to respond to.

I love longish 4x games, and I was really looking forward to this. It failed mainly because the theme is not well integrated to the mechanisms in my opinion.

-What is the reasoning behind a building running out? "There can be no more harbors in the world!"
-You can be the strongest player militarily without any units in your single army! Just have enough barracks and leaders.
-Resource use - you can blow up buildings using silk!
-The technologies are not intuitive and you basically have to memorize them or suffer from severe AP. And you really have to optimize each tech buy or you might fall way behind.

Also, I much prefer hexes over squares.

When we were about three hours into our first game, this looked like a winner and surefire purchase to me: multiple paths to victory, a brilliant technology tree, short and punchy actions, cool combat ... another hit out of the park for FFG.

After another couple of hours, in which I was hit by several droughts in spite of having built the UN, and had lost a couple of my own culture cards and oodles of trade to no less than three Writing action nerfs, I was more willing to punch Kevin Wilson on the nose. Especially since we strongly suspected that something was awry, but neither the rulebook nor the official FAQ that we consulted during the game helped.

Thus, the game gets docked three points from the nine it would have deserved with proper card editing:
- one for the sloppiness itself
- another one because FFG had really shaped up its act with Runewars and Android, games that are playable right out of the box without any similar hassles and rule corrections
- and yet another one because those three Writing nerfs really bloody hurt.

Update
A couple more plays allowed me to overcome my initial misgivings - apart from the sloppiness described above, this is a very tight and good game, whose greatest strength lie in streamlining the parts that could have led less careful designers into a fiddliness nightmare (techs and armies, especially) and in balancing the various victory paths.

I say the latter although we’ve only seen military or monetary victories so far, both due to what I’ve read elsewhere and to how those games went. Both kinds of win require a bit of carelessness from your opponents; they have to leave you alone early in the game for a monetary win, and somebody has to neglect their defensive strengh to lose his capital and grant you a military win. I’m pretty sure that more experienced game groups will see more cultural and tech wins, especially since both these paths feed strongly into everything else you do: winning without some key technologies is impossible no matter what you do, and cultural events are crucial in blocking others from the win and protecting your finishing moves.

All in all, this is probably Kevin Wilson’s most accomplished design to date - not his best or his most original (both slots would be filled by Android, in my opinion), but the one with the best balance and most seamless play (apart from some initial hurdles to overcome ...).

Another in a long line of games that try to reimplement the venerable computer game as a board game.  I have yet to play one that both captures the nuances of the computer game without making me think (often) that it would be great to have a computer keep track of the myriad of bits of information.  

I need to give this another play, as we got several rules wrong for varying parts of the game, and we didn't get to complete it, as it was a learning game.

Having played this with corrected rules, it's not bad, but it does seem to run fairly long.

This game has good ideas all over the place, but a (for me, major) drawback: if you make a mistake at the early game, you will lose for sure, hands down.

As I was a newbie, it was clear since the beginning that the player who conquered my capital would win the game, so everybody went after me. I simply had no way to catch up since I didn't think every opportunity at the early game. It was frustrating.

Captures the feel of the PC game wonderfully while not relying on the source material to make the game work. All the mechanics are fairly sound. I love the fact that you have multiple ways to try and achieve victory, can cause some tense races to the finish...can I complete my economic victory before the other guy over runs a main city for a military victory?

Components are nice and play their parts well. Lots of little wrinkles to the game yet still fairly straightforward.

There are some pretty serious king-maker and runaway leader issues here.  I don't mind some of that in shorter games, but in a 3 hour game, nobody should ever realize that they have no way of winning and still have 2 hours at the table.  That screams design flaws to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impressions are this is an outstanding game.  The rules are excellent, leaving very few questions after the first game played.  Quality of components also good, not as flashy as the FFG big box games (hence, it is the small box format).

Quibbles are exceptionally minor.  The trade/coin dials are inferior to the Runewars setup.  The battle cards have minor design issues - tiny icons, green/blue hard to discern on the tiny icons, asymmetrical backs.

Tech tree implementation is great.  Game provides a tremendous amount of replay just in the tech part alone - more than twice as many techs available as normally used in a single game.

After 7 plays this game is outstanding.  The balance and the replayability are great for a 4P game.  We can now play in 2 hours without a problem.  Civ in 2 hours, tough decisions, replayability, and FFG quality.  This is looking like a new 10 for us.

The game is a 4P game.  3P is okay.  2P is a pass.  Each plays a bit differently.

Latest word - dropped from 10 to 9 due to scaling.  Only the 4P works for me.  And now another drop to an 8 to make room for Clash of Cultures which I prefer to this one.

2015 - after some 3P plays dropped rating to a 7. These really did not impress. Will try again someday with 4, but the game is about played out.

Traded for Nations via BGG 7/15/16.

----

Received in BGG Trade for Champions of Midgard 5/21/16.

I like the "Age of Empires" feel to it, but it feels like the game takes way too long for what it is.  The turns go by relatively quickly, but they also feel clunky.  Mary and I aren't really prone to AP, but this game brings it out.  

The combat sounds like a good idea in theory, but there's something about it I'm not entirely happy with.  I feel like the entire experience could've been streamlined without taking too much from gameplay.

There just isn't as much elegance as some of the heavier games.  At 2p, this is a 90 minute game for us.  In that time, we could've played two games of Terra Mystica, Kanban, or Scythe... much more fulfilling experiences.

In short- Way Too Fiddly.

06/13/15 Played a four player game in 5.2 hours (nine turns). 
The game itself, its good. But the three hour play time stated on BGG is ludicrous. Maybe, maybe, if it was a two player game and both players knew the rules inside out they could finish in that amount of time. Most people said six hours for a first play with a full compliment was more accurate. I (now) agree. That's not necessarily bad, but BGG and the box misleading me that much rankled me. My feeling is the game is overly complex. Sure they streamlined it by leaving out certain aspects of the PC game. But not enough. For it still takes forever! Overall the production values are high. But there are omissions. For example, how/when you spend culture tokens does not appear on the double sided player aid. I'd play it again, sometime (hopefully not for at least a year), but I'd never ask for it.  For there are better/shorter/less complex Civ games. I agree with one comment I saw here on BGG, "I'd rather do my taxes."

The variable player powers are fun. Researching technologies is fun. Gaining rewards through culture is fun. Exploring the map is fun. The basic mechanic of collecting resources from the land around your cities is much like in the PC game, and that aspect of things also works well.

On the downside, the entire army and battle system is a bit boring and takes up too much focus in the game. The cards and upgrade tokens are fiddly and you never feel like you're in solid control over your military. The battles themselves are also a bit boring.

The other downside is that this game is really long and you spend a lot of time waiting around for other people to take their city actions. Our group's first game was called to a halt after 4 hours when it was approaching 1am and there was still no immediate winner in sight. Granted, much of that time was spent looking up rules, because oh man there are a lot of them.

After playing a few more games, we now "get it" and the gameplay moves a little faster, thankfully. But it still has a tendency to outstay its welcome in the last 40 minutes or so.

Really poor 4X with great componenets... Wasted potential of this game.

Explore - After 2-3 turns there is nothing more to explore because entire map has been already discovered. You can play with revealed map tiles as well...
Exterminate - It does not arouse warfare feeling... battles are just kind of solitare.
Expand - Interesting but there is probably standard and predictible way that everybody use. Fast 2nd city close to Your opponent.

A long game were there is allways something to do. 

Each time is different, and each time you can go for a different strategy, try new technologies, build different buildings. There is enought randomness in the game to make it interesting but almost no luck is involved in gameplay.

Has the best of the eurogames with the spice of wargaming.

But not recomended for everybody, since it has a lot of options, different strategies and some confusing rules (like the battle system).

Might Trade.  I love the Civilization video game series.  I was sure this purchase was going to be slam dunk for me.  Now I consider it a complete waste of my money.  I tried once to show this to my sister.  We barely started the game, and both wanted to quit.  She still refers to this as the game with too many pieces and rules.  She thinks that about most of my games, but I know this is the one she means.  And you know what?  For once I agree with her.  Especially since I can turn on the video game and have the computer keep track of all the fiddly bits.  Why anyone would ever want to play this as a board game I will never know.  I feel guilty and disloyal saying anything bad about Civilization even if it is the board game rather than the video game.  So I'll say this: the average rating is pretty high, so someone must like it.

After 1 game even with some clearly too random/broken stuff removed (like nukes) it still seems to be broken.

Combat seems too strong and hard to win other way or defend against.
From what I've seen Russian leader seems too strong (nice production bonus + very nice tech stealing which is very hard to prevent later in the game with units moving 5 on a small map).

Maybe after many plays when playing with all experienced players it's possible to prevent heavy-military player from killing someone and win in a different way in the same time.
From what I've heard from player who played more and from what I've seen it's unlikely it's balanced.

I am not willing to buy it anymore and probably won't play either.
It's a shame since it has lots of Civ-the-computer-game-like mechanics and civ-like feeling and would score much higher if would be a bit more balanced.

everything fits and it works.  compared, somewhat unfairly, to Through the Ages.   TTA is a much better 2p game and potentially 3p as well, but this Civ is a better 4p experience.   I think the game was designed as a 4p as there is a nice natural alliance for opposite players and better trading opportunities that do not really exist otherwise.

3p variant posted here is nice and creates a more balanced board.  trading is not really present and there is heavy bash the leader.

initial play or two takes far far longer than the game will take once those are under the belt which might turn off some groups.  i almost think the playtime of those initial plays will be 1.75x or even 2x.

still interesting.  potential kingmaker issues during the last turn of the game, but the overall experience is enough that it does not bother me.  takes at least 2 or 3 plays to get a feel for the different victory conditions.  odds are that your playgroup will initially sway to one of the four and it will take a period for players to adjust to the other options.

3p works with the map variant (posted in the variants section), but the game really is a 4p game.  if a player ends up dueling with both opponents, they will likely be climbing a steep hill back into the game to compete for a victory.

trying 2p this coming Sunday for an hour just to see if it is remotely interesting, but I expect this will be the only 2p game I play of this.

**************

2p about as expected.  neat way to try out different things.  coins great and certainly an interesting strategy.  hard to get really cranked up, but might be the hardest to deal with in late game (regarding preventing victory).

do not really get comments about tech/military.  tech very much functions as a game clock as essentially eveyone will end up 0-2 turns from a tech "victory" at game end if the game ends in this manner.

**************

given the very abstractedness of military combined with the map - i think the design works just fine.

Decent attempt at getting the look and feel of the Civ 4/5 computer game into a boardgame. Feels a bit restrictive in some aspects e.g. number of towns. No clue what the best strategies would be, but convinced that military plays a strange role (e.g. could be overpowered in two-player).

The thrill is gone with me.  Enjoyed it at first, with a real feel of building a civilization up from nothing. The tech tree bugged me with no prerequisites (except the pyramid style of building it).  A good game ruined by a spectacularly lousy combat system. Random, rock paper scissors style of combat hinders any real planning in combat. Up for trade now.

One of FFG's best. One of the few games where the vast numbers of strategic options is actually a good thing instead of something that hinders you (TI3 I'm looking at you...). I've never understood why some games force you to choose between moving, building, and researching. Civilization lets you do all three every turn and it does two things: Enables you to actually execute whatever strategy you want, and keeps the game moving. There is a reason that TI3 takes many more hours to play (with much less actually going on).

RATING: 8
Good, solid civ game. Far superior to the previous attempt at a board game based on the computer game. The components were overall very good, although the plastic pieces were uninspired (I'd rather have nation-specific counters). The combat system does make for some tedious down-time. The tech-tree/pyramid seems less restrictive or proscriptive than in many other versions of Civilization (computer or boardgame), in that you don't seem to necessarily have to research every technology and there aren't specific prerequisites. That may lead to greater replayability.

Rating after 1 play. Definitively a great game I will want to play more often. I enjoy the multiple paths to victory, and the interaction level with other players. Is a complex game, which I think will take a few plays to enjoy to the full. The combat system is a a bit fiddly, but works well, and is also fun. Long game.

The game design itself is sheer brilliance and reflects the computer game amazingly well. 

On the minus side you have 7-8 tech cards in front of you, culture cards, great person cards and other things each with their own unique effects which you have to remember. Towards the end of the game you eventually have so many cards with unique effects that you're battling the game itself as much as other players. Forget about trying to know what your opponent might have in terms of abilities because he's got just as much junk in front of him as you do.

The result for me is the more I play the game the less I like it.

Rating after first solo play. Incredibly well balanced, which surprised me. Almost TOO many choices to make from turn-to-turn. A far superior Civ experience that TTA for a number of reasons: significantly less fiddly, what FFG Civ lacks in micromanagement, it makes up for in a tactical layer, and for a number of ways to effect one's opponent besides merely military (something I feel is severely lacking in TTA.) Easier to master than TTA (but only barely so), artwork and design better than TTA.

I can see this one really growing with repeated plays.

---------------------------------------

Ratings bump to 9 after a three player game that came down to victory in the final turn. Those that complain there is not enough player interaction are simply not playing it right. TONS of difficult and interesting choices that create a web of strategic effects later in the game, and a tremendous amount of balance between the various victory paths. Can't wait to play it more.

Great game, well designed.
One interesting point of the game, though, is that it differs from other type of elimination game -- where players usually band together to stop the winning player from taking the crown... this game, player band together to try and eliminate the weakest player to win the game. Sadly, it's also a flaw of the game mechanic making the losing player no longer wanting to play the game.

RATING: 7
OK, let me start by saying that this is a good game, with a lot of things going on and a lot to consider on your turn.  I would have rated it an 8, but our 1st play took 6 hours with setup and rules explanation.  It's very difficult for me to rate any game that takes over 4 hours higher than a 7.  I mean a rating of 8 has at the ending of it's description "and will never turn down a game".  I know that with more plays (with the same group of people) the time would probably drop to 4 hours or less, but I just don't see this happening any time soon.

Of course there are exceptions.  I mean Twilight Struggle and Through the Ages can take over 4 hours as well, but I've rated these higher.  Maybe someday I will raise this game's rating as well after more plays.  But is that really going to happen?  I highly doubt it.  Reason being is that it will just not see the table with our group but on a rare occasion (i.e. holiday / weekend gaming... which is once or twice a year at best).  And to be honest with you, even though this game has beautiful components and map compared to TtA's spartan & drab presentation, most of the time I would prefer TtA to this game.  TtA just feels more intuitive and steamlined, even without the map (probably because it doesn't have a map).

So I may change my mind in the future and bump this game up in rating (don't really see it going down), but for now I leave it at a respectable rating of 7.

They tried to cram the PC version of Civilization into this game, and I think that was an impossible feat from the start.

Long game, with many choices to be made. Not much trade or diplomacy involved, really is a development race with little player interaction although military can mess with other players quite a lot (which is good). I'd definitely like to play again to try a real strategy.

Some culture cards, leaders and items you pick up seem rather powerful which can introduce a random element, and may swing the game which isn't good in such a long game.

Miltary for coin victory is strong strategy.

Slow buildup of your civilisation (variable based on start), by exploring, researching technology, dominating in war, commercial or developing a culture. A greatly designed game, but for me this is the max length and effort I can put into playing a board game. Average time seems to be 4 hours. Would much prefer everything to be more automated (i.e. a computer game). Would like it more if tiles were limited by how many a player can build, thus not run out of specific tiles (e.g. all harbour tiles can be gone before I build one).

RATING: 7
Not great 2P with overemphasis on military, but it works well otherwise. I dislike that the tech tree appears to be a necessity for everything else to win, but I appreciate the idea of the many paths to victory. I love the theme, the map, the component quality, the many paths to victory (though they are imbalanced unfortunately), and the general gameplay and variety is enjoyable too. I dislike the long playtime. I also wish we could play simultaneously more, to speed it up.

Replayed and it had lost its initial impact and luster. I found it fiddly and long to setup (on par with Arcadia Quest and other long setup games which irked me) plus a lot of unrefinement and strange combat that I wasn't super fond of. But an enjoyable experience albeit long even at 2p. It is indeed an enjoyable enough game Ill admit though, I just feel like it could be refined more and less fiddliness and more intuitive. Maybe make military less enticing too - it's so much of a snowball effect, robbing resources...maybe if you can only go to war with an AI and don't gain as much? Not sure.

Nach einigen Partien muss ich Civi mittlerweile etwas runterstufen. Es ist zwar immer noch DAS Zivilisationsaufbauspiel meiner Wahl, aber hat nach sechs Jahren für mich doch etwas an Reiz verloren. Trotz zahlreicher Partien bleibt das Kampfsystem immer noch nicht sonderlich intuitiv und ich weiss bis heute nicht, ob wir es richtig handhaben.

Deswegen die Abwertung von der einstigen 10 um einen Punkt.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
3 quick plays so far. Amazingly detailed game, achieves the intentions of Civilization extremely well.

Obviously, it's FFG so parts and looks are amazing.

Each victory system seems viable, only initial concern is that an optimised coin build seems a bit too strong.

This is a game that suffers badly in assymetric information environments - if players know more or less about the core technology decks than the others at the table, they will be at a significant advantage/disadvantage. This is not a game for the uninitiated.

It's also quite hard to teach to a newcomer, but it is very teachable by playing a few rounds (unlike some games which can't avoid lengthy briefings).

I will update based on further plays and a highly competitive 4 player game I'm planning later this week... if it stands up to pro play, I'll probably give it a 9.

Great game.

---------------
Update after 10 plays.

Game is still fantastic - This is a well built game that offers a VERY wide array of strategy and builds.

Only concerns so far:

- Russia is overpowered. They are good at frickin' everything. They shouldn't be given Communism from Turn 1, it's too powerful.

- Culture is weak. Once you get experienced players at the table, military conflict is constant and escalating. Culture can't compete in that space because it has to stop harvesting culture to build units/armies.

- Tech victories are only possible with Russia or with early culture cards to exchange ideas. Tech needs at least 15 turns without acceleration. The game is usually over by turn 11-12.

-------------

Okay, so we've ticked over to 15 plays. This game is amazing. Seriously, this is one of the greatest games ever made, IMHO.

Comments regarding the clunkyness or the spamminess are misplaced. This is a beautiful, rich, deep and rewarding game experience and I have found a use for every single one of its beautiful components.

I'm bumping this to 9.5

-----
Screw it. This is my 10.

It's the only game I'm giving this to, and mainly because the game works just as well with a variant we are really enjoying, where you ignore all racial effects and all players simply select a turn-one first tier technology of their choice.

A 10 can only go to a game that meets the highest standards of theme, component quality, mechanics, design, balance, flow, concept and strategic/tactical legitimacy. As far as I'm concerned, I can think of no game which comes close to this one on virtually every one of those fronts and for the 'empire' or 'civilisation' game category, this is truly the masterpiece.

Never gets old, everyone loves to play it, a beautiful game.

10/10 and well earned.

Better than Through the Ages, and not just because it has a map - this is actually fun. Also I thought the abstract map would detract from the game, but it doesn't. In fact, I really like the way it produces a different set-up each time (8.5)

Update: With each play I enjoy this less. Too much is going on in each players' own area rather than being contested on a map. And although exploring is a lot of fun there are just too many random swings of fate. I also find the combat system a little dull and unnecessary. Ultimately there isn't an exciting story at the end of the game, which is what I'd hope for with a game with this much going on.

Gioco molto bello con possibilità di raggiungere la vittoria finale perseguendo differenti strategie. Scala bene da 2 a 4 e offre la possibilità di scegliere differenti civiltà rendendo il gioco molto longevo. Materiali e disegni di qualità, il gioco però non è immediato e necessita di diverso tempo e spazio.

RATING: 6
Impressive stuff on the surface, with real civ-building prospects, and the race variety is the key to the options and longevity, which is why the expansion is high on my wishlist. But when you dive in, there really aren't that many interesting options, and the best course of action is disappointingly obvious most of the time.

A full, 4P game will prove if it has enough to offer, but that's a big time sacrifice.

Very good game derived from a computer game, rules are not so difficult and calculations are not impossible, graphics is good. 
However, there are a lot of better civilization games around and this game needs a lot of +X tokens to remember all the bonuses. 
Novice players tend to forget easily to pursue victory conditions and lose themselves into building a nice civilization.

Brings back memories and does resemble the computer version of it. While I enjoyed both plays, I don't really get that feeling that yes, buy me, play me. Not sure what, but for some reason not really for me. (Note: Through the Ages still somehow brings the old PC game feel back, while it is much more abstracted and without a map).

Very good implementation of the computer game.  Not too fiddly or too many bits (although there are a bunch). Very good civ/empire building game.

Downside is the play time which seems about the same as the computer game.

2 player game is close to a zero sum game.  Can't play nice with opponents and win.

In a 2p game Egypt and Germany seem over powered.

Base game is an 8.  With expansion this goes to a 9.  I still prefer the old AH version (Adv Civ) but this version goes from very good to great with the expansion.

After about 10-12 sessions, here's my verdict: 

With a regular group of enthusiasts, it could eventually become one of those very few personal all time favourites, but it has issues. It's unbalanced; it's unthematic in some aspects (combat system; no terrain effects on movement or combat, limits for wonders and star buildings...). Also, it doesn't really feel like you're building a civilization. It's a race for your designated victory condition, and it always comes down to military. It's a 4x game with a civilization theme, and by far the best way to play it is with straigh in-your-face aggressiveness. I don't mind that at all, but new players may be disappointed. 

More thoughts: It's prone to AP, but mitigation is possible. For example, allow spending culture at any time in order to draw cards before your city management phase. Prepare help sheets, especially for counting resources like hammers/city. Real playing time: ~1.5 hours/player. Record: 8 hours for a 3p session, pure awesomeness! 

Compared to other contemporary civs, I currently like this one the most. If TtA is a classic symphony, then that game is Motorhead.

Playing this game turned out to be quite an experience!

First, this game is not for everyone, it's truely for board game geeks. However, once you get passed the first one or two hours required to assimilate the endless game rules and get to know the wealth of content, this game turns into a total blast, that will totally make you forget that you've been playing for 5 straight hours.

Players are faced with very interesting and meaningful choices at every turn. The multiple ways of winning provide a chance for every player to get back from behind. This however is less true in 1 vs 1 games, making 3 players and 4 players games much more interesting.

This has turned out to be one of the favorites, but there are some things I'm not that big of a fan of, especially how the technologies have no prerequisite requirements apart from the levels, so it doesn't have the same kind of feel of developing a civilization rather than just develop something for your benefit like the other parts of the game. What I mean is you can get mass media without writing, for example. Then again, if this had some massive tech tree, it might become too difficult to follow with the amount of techs.

Another thing are the battles, that are slightly too abstract for my taste. It does not matter even if your units are on the other side of the planet, you still can defend your cities with your army. Technically I understand the idea of this. In a war, no major city is left undefended. Even if you have armies all over the world, there is some reserve staying in the cities. I like this aspect, but in the game it still is a tad too abstract. Battles itself are boring with the base game unit cards, but the revised cards from Wisdom&Warfare expansion makes them a lot better. 

This is one of the few games I keep thinking after every play how I could've played better.

An epic affair of building up your production engine, carefully buying exactly the right building for each city and putting it in the right place on the map, of carefully researching exactly the right technology ability to give you an edge over the other players ... and then it moves into the mid-game "who's winning, we better beat them up" phase, where armies get sent out to blokade and pummel. Therefore your aim is to first set up militarily strong enough to deter said mid-game beat-ups, and/or have the conviction and willingness to engage militarily to beat up anyone who's invested more in going for a faster win and has let their military lag as a result. The trick is being aware enough to know exactly what's going on in your opponents' worlds so you can act in time. The tech tree and building combinations are rich and need to be studied to enable the kind of insight needed to do well, not only for awareness, but in building smart combinations that will not only provide an edge but also a degree of satisfaction in developing a well-thought out strategy regardless of the inevitable kingmaker beat-ups that will likely happen in the end-game. While it won't come out a lot due to the time investment required, I'm sure I'll enjoy exploring the game further with each playing.

An "explore, develop & growth" game should be concentrating on explore, develop & growth. This is ruined with warring. Warring is best suitable on wargames (which I do like a lot) but usually makes games like this less fun. The fastest way to win this game is by fighting, and if the others don't spend a lot of effort to stop the aggressive player there is NO other way to win the game before him. 

The game is also a bit short, especially if you take to account that it takes four hours to play. With short I mean you have very few turns & actions before the game ends. 

Added after my third try: 
Sadly this game gets worse for each play. Had to turn down my rating a notch. First time the win wasn't by warring, but it was due to warring. Three players killed off each other's military, and let the fourth win by collecting coins.

A very good civ-game. The components are great, the theme is well felt, the mechanics fit together very well.

We got faster as the game progressed and when we had finaly chosen our own path to victory.

the game is rules-heavy with lots of exceptions that must be remembered, and is simply not elegant and very often counter-intuitive.
you have no idea why this tech does this and not something else, the combat mechanic with it's diversion into units and token is very strange, and overall it is difficult to get into the flow of the game, esp. for unexperienced games.

Based on one play: I was expecting more of a army build up and unit based game. This is a Euro style tech tree, economic engine and resource collection game. You need to build techs to increase your options and then collect resources (gold, trade) and build up your cities to continually advance. There are some battles, which are card based, but very few player to player battles (usually). A little long and repetitive, but worth a try if your interested in these game mechanics.

The game did feel very much like the computer game, but I did have some issues with it.  For one, technology development felt way too open to me.  Because there was no tech tree, players could just go in any direction they wanted, and it was difficult to process every technology of a certain level when choosing one.  It felt really weird to get higher-level techs before getting lower-level ones that obviously should be prereqs.  Additionally, for all the city development and whatnot there was, it's still a multiplayer wargame at some level.  Not my favorite genre.

It's a fine game that I've enjoyed for the most part. My problem is that I enjoy other civilization games far more. I'm also not sure how balanced the base game is and the combat is a bit wonky.

Definitely the best medium length civ game out there. I like how well the resource handling is designed. There is no fiddling around with some resource tokens - you just add up the city´s production points and use them right away. The feel of city management and development is well represented. To me this game represents civ the computer game well enough - any more detailed and it becomes frustatingly fiddly (yes Antiquity, I am looking at you), any more abstract and it becomes dry or too light. Maybe the army system should have been different (more detailed and dice based perhaps?) but this would mean other parts of the game must be also designed a bit differently - and in this case maybe it wouldn´t be so great game anymore like it is now.

I really like the Civilisation computer game series. It isn't going to be easy recreating the experience of a solitaire computer game that lasts a month in a multiplayer board game that lasts an evening.
Unlike Through the Ages, Sid Meier's Civilization tries not to compromise the experience: there is a map, a tech tree, city development and some tactics in the military.
The result is a good multiplayer game with a feel for the computer game. I can accept the smaller map and the short tech tree to give a game of acceptable length.
On the downside, the three player map doesn't work well due to an edge of the map problem that limits city placement.
Also the military combat has problems - the game has to avoid a long combat sub game but I would prefer a simpler abstraction and do not like either the rock, scissors, paper approach, nor the fact that on a random card draw I can get a tank unit that can be defeated by a pikeman!
Not perfect but pretty good.
A friend has a copy and whilst I'm tempted to buy my own copy, I don't think that I'm going to.
Update: now that I own Clash of Cultures and Nations, this is completely off my purchase list - SMC:TBG needs the second expansion and probably the first as well and the result is too gimmicky and covered in band aids to compete.

Military feels too strong, since it weakens both players substantially (making them very vulnerable) after a pitched battle-- that's if they don't win outright.

A reasonable amount of depth, and not as hard to teach as you would imagine, but frequently feels like you're implementing an isolationist policy if you aren't pursuing military.

It's alright, for a Civ-building game.

The computer game is better, by far, though, for what it does. So why bother?
If I wanted to play a Civ game, I'd play Through the Ages, or Advanced Civilizayion.

Anyway-- it's not terrible-- and the variable player powers are a nice touch. Culture wins are nigh-impossible, though.

Does a pretty good job of implementing the computer game. And, as such, does a pretty good job of being a civ building game. One down side is that things build as the game goes on (to be expected in such a game, I suppose), but what that means here is that as they game goes on there's more and more for players to keep track of and to remember, so towards the end of the it can be a bit cumbersome. But still, not bad.

Not as good as people's rave reviews seem to indicate. The combat is the weakest part of the game; clunky and too random.

Yuck.  Yuck yuck yuck.  

Tedious bookkeeping with itty-bitty counters and flimsy dials.  Really FFG?  Would some nice wooden cubes have been too much to ask?  I know that's not your style, but geez...

Too much randomness for a game of this length.  Not only are the strength of the units you buy random, but you don't even get to choose the units you take into battle.  You shuffle them up and draw at random, thus missing the opportunity to add a layer of strategy.  On top of that, exploring the map is random, not only in what's on the tile, but the orientation of said tile based on how you enter it.  You might wind up getting a great windfall, or you might get shafted.  Who knows!  Oh, and the culture cards are add yet another layer of randomness.  It may be just what you need, it may be crap.

Deterministic strategies based on which civ you start with.  So, each civ has a different ability.  Okay.  Oh, but if you don't focus on a strategy that plays to your civ's strength, you're going to handicap yourself?  Way to limit a player's choices even more.

Another solid disappointment from Fantasy Flight Games.

This is a very unique in depth strategy board game. The rules can take a while to get to know, but the rule book does a fantastic job at explaining them. Civilization The Board Game supports up to four players, and it the game can take between 2-3 hours with two people and 3-4 hours with four people. This is a game that requires a lot of thought and strategy to play. A person can win in four ways: technology, culture, economy, and military. Depending on which victory a person chooses to pursue it can completely change the person's strategy. Another important quality this game has is that there are no dice, and hardly any luck.

The first time you open the box to this game you will be amazed at the amount of color and artistic images that are included. There are over hundred tokens, and the civilization cards all have a great drawing of a famous leader belonging to each civilization. This game has over 10 map tiles that each have 9 squares of different land types that look very artistic and beautiful. Images are also included on all of the military cards to represent all of the unit types including infantry, artillery, calvary, and aircraft. Each of these things may not make up entirely for the great graphics and animations you will find in the civilization video game, but they do a pretty good at transferring the video game's visuals into a board game.

The only things I would say are bad about this game is how long it takes to set up and play.

Very closely resembles the computer games, with some (wise) concessions & adaptations to better suit a boardgame.

RULES, while perhaps leaving some points unclear, are a vast improvement on previous FFG game rules I've read. They are well writen, fairly complete, mostly presented in turn-sequence order and are easy to reference if needed. During my first reading, most queries that arose were immediately clarified in subsequent paragraphs before I had chance to direct my browser to BGG. Easier to learn for anyone who's played any of the computer versions (although care must be taken not to overlook aspects that intentionally differ).

Honestly, I love most games and give a lot of games a 10 out of 10. This just so happens to be my favorite game. This game just offers so much variety of techniques and various strategy. I typically play two player becasue it is hard to find more then one other to play the game as it is a very complicated game and not for everyone. In the end I could say I would play this every day all day and be happy. I also think the expansion is amazing and necessary.

Cool design that captures the feeling of the computer game series, without trying too hard. What keeps me from rating this higher, is that it's basically a race to get one of the victory conditions fulfilled, and "branching out" isn't very efficient. 4+ hours of gathering culture every turn can be boring, but building wonders and an army and cool techs doesn't help you win if it doesn't give you extra culture. For the other victory conditions the feeling is similar.

I do very much like this game, though I think it inferior to TtA.  One of the few that prefers Civ Revolution over Civ IV (less is more), I am glad they based the board game on the former.  I think the game just needs an expansion to better balance things (now that it's been playtested and commented on by many people), such a cultural victory.  I was suprised that the terrain does not have more of an effect on units.

RATING: 9
Judging after two plays (3 and 4 player): a very good game! I would wish for more variety in the cards a player can develop and more and different wonders. The combat system is also a little clumsy, but works surprisingly well. More cards couldn't hurt because I hate to shuffle them during play. Otherwise nothing to complain. With 4 players 4 hours of sheer fun, competition and entertainment. I hope for an expansion set that adds stuff to the game!
UPDATE: Expansion sets came in, satisfying all my needs! Rating raised from 8 to 9. I love that FFG company!!! :meeple:

A true Civ experience.  The rules are more ambiguous and less elegant than Through the Ages, but a bit more intuitive and easier to teach.  Also, the setup of Civilization is somewhat faster than Through the Ages.  There are significant issues with the balance between the various routes to victory which are apparently addressed by the expansion.  Exploration is a blast.  Combat is a quick minigame which is reminiscent of that in Civilization IV and Civilization V.  The production is mostly top notch.

Although Through the Ages is probably a better game, I think it will be easier to get Civilization on the table, due in part to the brand name and production value.  Nonetheless, I prefer Through the Ages.

RATING: 5
Love the idea of a vast civilization building game.  The actual implementation is a little clunky.  In research, it's a definite race.  If you fall behind at any point -- you take longer than others to establish a second/third city, they use an income booster to put them over the requirement for the next tier a turn earlier than you -- you've lost the race, and no matter how good you do after that, it is very difficult to get back in it.  Sabotage or warfare are your realistic options.
The combat system... I don't like it.  There are four types of units, and the three basic types are essentially rock-paper-sissors setup.  You build a deck of combat cards by purchasing a random card of a certain type (which can be upgraded within its type by technology).  Each card will be one of three rankings; in the beginning this means a good card is three times more powerful than a bad one.  The aforementioned unit upgrades simply add one to the power of a given card, so a good level 1 card is just as numerically powerful as a bad level 3.  Combat is run by shuffling and dealing a number of cards to be your hand, the number based on how many armies you're fielding in the battle.  Most of the time, to me, it feels like just rolling dice would be equally as effective and a lot more fair for managing combat.

All that said, the varied technologies and different approaches to building schemes, not to mention the flavor of the game, attract me to keep giving it just one more try.

RATING: 6
Some great ideas, but poorly put together. Fun when you're winning, but painful otherwise (good games should be fun even when you don't win, e.g., Agricola, Race for the Galaxy). Endgame comes down to a barrage of cancellation abilities ("I cancel your cancellation which is cancelling my attempt to cancel your win condition!").

I enjoyed playing this game both times and I really want to like it.  When I was reading the rules I saw a flaw that came to fruition when we played yesterday.  I was going for an economic victory and everyone left me alone.  One player was going for a military victory and made no bones about the fact that he was going to crush us with his armies.  He chose the player on his left and moved in for the kill.  That player who was going for a culture victory was run over and had to spend all their city actions getting new armies and trying to defend.  They were out of the game early and knew it.  I won by economic a turn before the armies of the military player were going to take the capitol of the other player.  So, the culture player was mad because he got attacked.  Had the Military person attacked me the culture player or possibly the fourth player would have won.  Therefore, if someone goes military either he wins or he chooses who will lose based on who he goes after.

UPDATE: Second game, 4 player game, two days after Christmas. The rules are horribly written; this is a very simple game to learn and teach. Our second game went so much faster. Maybe only 2-2.5 hours?.

[b]This is not a negotiation game.[/b]

Dramatically downgraded from a 7 to a 4. I think I initially rated it high because I was enjoying copious amounts of beer.

Playing it sober make me realize that this game is a typical cube-pushing. economic-engine Euro. I'm actually willing to concede that this could be a well-designed Euro. Of course, it should be considered Ameritrash, which is just like any other pretentious Euro except for the following:

* Garish components -- artwork on individual tiles and cards is usually excellent, but the game as a whole is sight-numbing.

* Tiny die-cut cardboard chits in place of cubes

* Really, really, really fiddly and lots and lots of special power cards, specifically for recovering Magic the Gathering addicts.

* Direct conflict in place of some gimmicky mechanic to add some trace of player interaction. Some explanation here: fights between players occur sparingly but usually swing the balance of the game; losing a battle is disastrous. In addition, it's surprisingly easy to determine who will win the battle, provided that you have a good memory of your opponent's battle cards and have enough battle cards. So what happens is that if there's a warmonger among the players, everyone else has two strategies to balance: building up forces or racing to victory. This is all quite good: the player interaction is all about anticipating what you're opponents plan to do, and react accordingly. However, the focus is on this race to victory -- the race to build the VP engine the fastest -- and the military pressures each player faces simply adds a wrench to the proceedings.

As I mentioned before, I really don't like VP engine games, and the focus on Civ is this race to build the most efficient VP engine. I prefer games in which players have to focus on manipulating their opponents rather than the game's system.

=====================

One play during Christmas 2010, three player game.

I'm not a big fan of "4X" games (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate, according to Wikipedia), but this one seems to be well designed.

What made this game work, for me, is how the tech tree is implemented:

1. All technologies are available to all players
2, It is impossible for a player to build all technologies; this forces specialization and more difficult strategic decisions
3. Building higher tech levels does not require excessive cross-referencing; you don't need a specific technology to build a particular tech.

Still, it's a Fantasy Flight game, and thus a sterling example of Ameritrash, which, depending on your tastes, is either a godsend or a scourge:

1. Awfully gaudy artwork: Individually, each tile is decently illustrated with lots of detail. However, as a whole, it's a eye-straining mess. Couple that with all the tiny icons all over the board, and small text describing a special power, first games will definitely be learning games, or even off-putting for casual gamers. For instance, in our first game, we didn't bother with building wonders (which is a very valid tactic) because they were simply too far away from us; we were too busy going through our technology decks to bother.

2. Multiple paths to victory, but each path is a straight line: This is a common feature I find in many Euro games: there are about four main ways to win: build fifteen technologies, conquer a player's capital city, reach the end of the culture track (which involves spending culture points, one of many commodities in the game), and earning 15 coins. About halfway through the game, players will recognize the most efficient way to achieve each of these goals. I could compare this to Euro economic engine games in which you need one thing to get this, which gets you this, which gets you something else, and eventually a victory point. The trick in this game is to find the balance between achieving your goal and hindering your opponents. This, of course adds a lot of tension -- and clarity since players know exactly how to achieve these goals, and I believe many players to enjoy this. However, I have a preference for games with simple winning conditions, but they way to get there is not at all straightforward or intuitive.

3. Long and fiddly. The varying quality of the components does not help either. The tiles are made of very thick cardboard. However the card stock of the playing cards are cheap; I find it annoying that Fantasy Flight expects its customers to by sleeves -- they even advertise on the box which size of sleeves you should purchase.

4. A lot of special power cards. Lots. Players have 36 technologies to choose from, about eight different forms of government to pick from (which gives a player a special power), about ten different kinds of buildings and 6 "great people" (most of them simply give a player one or more resources), and about twenty different "wonders" to be built. I know many players love this kind of variety. As I mentioned before, I like how all players have access to all technologies, unlike games like Le Havre in which the player interactions is the competition for these special powers. Personally, though, I prefer games with elegant rules and not many of these special powers.

Disclaimer: rated as a 2-player game!

Longish civilization builder without many significant decisions. At first it may feel overwhelming (especially the lenghty rulebook), but when you actually start to understand the various aspects of the game, the paths to victory seem rather obvious. While there are numerous technologies to choose from, you lack almost any flexibility - some are just superior for the choosen path no matter how you look at it.

The military system is rather odd and very random; having some weaker units in your standing forces makes you wish to draw them during the easier fights to deliberately kill them and get rid of them (that's almost like a deckbuidling minigame, only it's not interesting at all).

Moreover, if, during a 2-player game, both players go for a peaceful approach, it's just a stale, boring solitaire. Absolutelly nothing happens, so, if you want at least a bit of tension, you should invest in your army to kick some butt. 

Long story short, I didn't like it that much.

This one's a winner so far. Can be fairly ruthless, but at heart it's not that different to St Petersburg. Choose a VP engine, get it running, and hope you come out on top by the end. It adds interest by having armies and cultural cards suddenly smashing building and destroying cities. Game doesn't wear out its welcome, and each side has enough individual aspects to it to make decisions interesting.

Christmas 2010.  So I just finished playing my first 'game' we agreed it was just a learning game so we'd not be declaring any winners.  It was quite fun.  It took much longer than I had thought it would, but I can see how it will go much faster once a feel for different strategies is learned.

I was stoked when I saw there was a Nuke available, particularly because I had two uranium tokens!  And yes I did get to Nuke two of his cities.  I'd like to play with three other people, but I don't know if I'd want to teach  to anyone that wasn't totally stoked to play a real civilization game.

Asymmetrical powers, with each civilization having different governments and benefits; exploration and movement of scouts and armies; city founding, resource gathering, building construction and production; war and looting; a tech tree; and investment and advancement in military, culture, politics, or economics for 4 different ways to end the game and win. An epic game (albeit one requiring a big time investment), great production, and will seem familiar to anyone who has played the computer game.

SLIGHTLY CLUNKY BUT VERY FUN 4X GAME
Finally got around to playing this twice around TG weekend 2011 (approx. 11 months after acquisition (its like that sometimes)). Two (2P) plays in I understand generally how to play but feel like I have merely nicked the surface of a very deep game.  There is a lot to pay attention to, too much for the first couple of plays.  Definitely an all day game, at least with inexperienced players.  I think you need to commit to your strategy early in this game - switching gears against a competent opponent is a recipe for a loss.  Definitely a GAMER'S GAME - but the casual player should stay away.

Third play - still excellent.  This game REALLY does give the Civilization Building Experience in a manageable package.  I totally feel the theme while playing this game, unlike say Through the Ages which is very clever but feels more like an exercise in moving round disks around.  I love the modular map.

Nice components and map tiles. Rules were pretty concise.

Did not care for the combat system - seems like it can be manipulated.

Did not care for the victory conditions - more of a race to the end with some tracks easier than others.

Not much of a chance to come from behind and not much of a chance to bring the leader down. After a while the game conclusion is pretty obvious.

Did not like the civ. specific advantages, some seem to powerful.

Liked the exploration, building placement, resource management, and tech tree.

Don't think I will play this again, for the time invested it just does not reward.

Quite often one player is effectively out of the game after a few rounds. I also hate the fact that defending your capital against an aggressive player may become a struggle for survival with no chance to win the game in the end. Being as the defending player you are only denying the military victory of the aggressor but you can't win the game anymore. The coin victory is far too easy in the base game.

Playing a 4-hour struggle is sometimes a bit painful, seems to be best with equally skilled players and equally good nations.

 Looks like this will become one of our favorites along the lines of TI3 but shouldn't be as long. Having our first game soon to try out the mechanics.

First was a 3 player game and one went for the cultural victory, another for the Tech and myself as the Germans a Military victory. Great game, we liked all the mechanics even the combat which seemed a little simple at first but has it's strategies.

RATING: 6
This game is such a typical Fantasy Flight product. There are loads of bits, all well produced, and it is based on a classic game (in this case a computer game). The turn is simpler than it initially appears - collect trade/take one action with each city (you have up to three)/move armies and conduct battles/use that trade to buy technologies. 
Everything fits around that basic structure. There are four different ways to win and while you have to work towards one it doesn't feel like you are totally locked into it. The whole thing comes down to a race at the end which can be quite close.
There are some down-sides. There are a lot of pieces, it is clearly quite easy to end up off the pace, and there is a lot of down time if a player is not involved in the game. And it does take a fair bit of time.
The computer game of course borrows a title from a 1980s game which is real classic and this doesn't really live up to the elegance and simplicity of that. Still if you want a slightly meatier game and don't fancy a space setting this is a worth while game.

The art is garish and distracting, the gameplay clunky and long. I'll take any 18xx over this if I have this amount of time to game. AH's Civilization or Through the Ages are so elegant compared to this mess.

(+) *Beautiful* art and material.
(+) Interesting and exciting battle-mechanic: not just rolling dice but deck building and tactical mini-game.
(+) This game feels epic, just like a good civilization-game should
(+) A very true Civilization computer game translation
(+) You feel 'powerful' while playing the game. You are in command of armies, or you have access to important cultural influence, you develop powerful technologies or gather scarce resources. You feel like you are 'in control'.

(-) It takes a long time to explain and play the game: this is a gamers game only
(-) Some bookkeeping
(-) I'm not entirely sure all factions are equally balanced. Still: each time the end-game was really tight.

I cannot for the life of me understand why someone would want to play this. Ever. It's long, bloated, fiddly. Half the game is counting up your resources each turn and the other half is just cranking a straightforward engine with occasional random awful card-based combat that seems designed on a dare because "Hey nobody likes lucky dice combat like Risk, let's do lucky random cards instead."

And at 2-3 hours, nobody is going to play this often enough to even unearth high level play. There's no excuse to be caught playing this.

Only played 2-player, worked very poorly. Not inclined to play with more players or with expansions. Not my type of game, too much moving around and posing/calculating with armies taking the place of more interesting interaction. It is too blunt, just military that needs to be balanced against the other options. "Strategic" choice of what goal to aim for is boring to me, one choice and the rest of the game you have to execute that choice.

I was so excited to get this game played. The game looks so beautiful and the gameplay is so solid. You are a civilization that is trying to expand your cities and armies to be the most advanced , or most wealthy or most culturally rich civilization or destroy another players capital in battle. The Game for the first 2 hours was great  decent 9 then with every hour the game dragged on I had to lower it.

Pros: incredible components. Multiple strategies to win. Very immersive gameplay.unique battle mechanism

Cons: long play time, very cutthroat, NOT TO BE PLAYED WITH INDECISIVE PLYERS!!!, confusing battle mechanism

--Nov2010-- On first play: long; intriguing; fragile; compelling.  We saw Atomic Energy in action as a city was nuked - completely destroying one player's (probably the leader, but...) chance of victory.  It seems that the target one acquires by being a front-runner is entirely undesirable, yet the game will be even longer if everyone tip-toes toward the finish.
The mechanics are quite amusing, and well worth a second play.  At this point, I'd be strongly leaning toward a purchase if I thought my sons would play.  But since I know folk with a copy, I'll hold off for a bit yet.
--Jan2011-- After a second play, I'm less excited.  The game [i]is[/i] fascinating.  But the end game has left something to be desired both times out.  It's vaguely reminiscent in that regard of [color=blue]Serenissima[/color]:  there the game is fascinating, and the endgame entirely unacceptable.

This game is exactly what you would expect: a very good simulation of the computer game it is based on. It takes a very long time to play and has a huge amount of things piling up that you need to reminder.

RATING: 6
My initial high hopes were somewhat disappointed, but with more plays the game revealed itself to be more interesting than at first sight. It certainly seems that economic victories are too easy and culture victories too difficult (a fact clearly acknowledged in the tweaks in the expansion). I can't escape the sneaking suspicion that FFG brought the game out a tick before the design was fully matured; it really needs the expansion to be complete.

The game is all about efficiency, and making an early mistake can cost you victory. You need a good idea from  very early on of which of the paths to victory you will use. It is possible to interfere with the other player's plans by military attacks and using culture cards, and knowing which player should be kept in check is an essential skill for an enjoyable game: the players balance out the game, not the mechanics. 

To sum up, while I'm overcoming my initial scepticism, and will certainly play it if it is suggested, there are still a few things I'm not overly enamoured of: I dislike the combat system as being overly deterministic and taking far too long when one considers that the result is rarely in doubt at the beginning; the game's feel of an efficiency race is not much to my taste; at the end of the game, turn order can be of supreme importance.

I've owned this game since it was released. I'm one of the few who actually like Eagle Games' old translation of the computer game franchise, and was eagerly looking forward to FFG's take on it.

I had the box lying around gathering dust for about a year, while trying to get it played at least three times. For some reason, the rule book killed my enthusiasm every time. I don't abhor rules, generally - I like a meaty, complex game - but something about these 30 pages of not very exceptional instructions just put me off, and convinced me to pick up another title instead.

The fourth time, I almost didn't read it through (again). Setup was slightly confusing, as rules are cross referenced from paragraph to paragraph, and you have to scrutinize the rather small image of how the board is supposed to look like rather closely to get all the pieces in the right places.

Likewise, the first turn or two was chaos. Battle incomprehensible, in its simplicity, and resource management baffling. Then, something clicked and the game took off!

This is exactly the kind of game I like. Multiple victory conditions, lots of important choices both short term and in the long run - you don't have the time to do everything you'd like (a plus, in my book), and even though it seems you have to follow one singular strategy to win you have to keep investing at least a little something in the other victory avenues too - to keep pressure on other players who are pursuing them.

Summa summarum: For some reason, this game has a steeper learning curve than it should, for a relatively simple game. Once you get into it, it's easy to play, with great depth, variety and replay value.

I love this game.  It's FFG produced, so you know all the MANY components in this game are well made and fit their purpose.  There is a ton going on in this game to keep you thinking, and while tense, I always have fun.  Even when I lose horribly, I just enjoy playing this game.  Downtime between turns is cut down by some of the phases being simultaneous, but there is still some downtime when playing with AP prone players.  My biggest qualms are that my game group can't play this in under four hours and I had to remove the beautiful insert to fit all the pieces back in the box.  I guess you can't have it all, but this game comes very close.

A surprise to me - I was interested in it, but I didn't expect this to become one of my best games of all time.

It has a lot of what makes Twilight Imperium great for me, but with a more reasonable play-time and player-count. It's entirely open info, lowish luck, and very faithful to it's chosen theme.

Adding the expansion bumps this up even further, refining the weakest strategy (culture) and causing it to suddenly drop into place mentally for me.

Epitome of bad elements in FFG design style: wanting to fit everything from the computer counterpart resulted in lots of clunky mechanisms which don't fit together that well, many of which seem a bit out-of-place in a civ sim game: rock-paper-scissors battle resolution, take-that element in the form of culture cards, which can do random bad things to opponents by flicking your fingers and more. It's a curious monster, much too complicated for what it is. Not a bad game really, but Clash of Cultures does everything so much better - it's simpler, more realistic and much more elegant.

Could they not have given this a substantially different name than the previous incarnation - "Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame". Would that have been so hard? Perhaps "Sid Meier's Civilization: Revolution", or "Sid Meier's Civilization: déjà vu".

At first, despite the good attempt to simplify the game into a board game ultimately it's still a fiddly beast. But then, after a few plays you realise it's not really - it plays rather smoothly. And what a nice looking and entertaining beast it is. It's seen multiple plays in my house and each time I marvel more and more at how clever the combat system is, how beautifully balanced the whole beast is and how much fun we have with it.

My only concern is that the playing style always favours an aggressive and militaristic strategy - certainly it's a safer path to follow. That kind of reflects the computer version though - gamers tend to like to beat each other up. It's no more militaristic than Civilization: Through the Ages and there's something satisfying about having bits to move around a board.

A good effort that I see has a continued place in my gaming cupboard. With games running in at easily under three hours it's a keeper for me.

Civilization has some cool stuff going on. The different paths to victory all seem legitimate. The tech tree implementation is simple, but still allows for a lot of customization. I like the cultural progression, and the different cards and great people that provide extra abilities.

But I don't really like this game in general. It doesn't move along very quickly since there is obviously a lot to think about. Combat during the game is kind of lame; there aren't a lot of meaningful military decisions. And counting up trade and production gets kind of messy.

I can definitely see why a lot of people would like this game; the progression is noticeable and significant, and the nation growth could be exciting. But I thought it just kind of lumbered along. Maybe 4X games aren't for me? I'm not sure.

I like Civilization in a lot of ways.  I like having a map, exploration, expanding technologies.  Also, a lot of the game is fairly intuitive.  There are some things I am not crazy about.  

It seems to me that the military could be better.  For one thing the military battles seem too punitive and are a bit unbalanced.  The losing player loses (1) a figure, (2) all his cards in play, and (3) a resource or some other spoil.  The losing player would have to spend at least 4 civil actions, maybe more, to even get back to where he started and the other player gets ahead.  Second, I think the mechanics lead to an odd situation that if a player is weak, his military figures become a liability.  I am not sure if the rules permit it, but there are cases when it would be desirable to just disband or destroy ones own military figures.  If not, a stronger player can attack to obtain spoils.  It being a benefit to destroy one’s own army figures seems really odd, but if you are weak, then having no military figures is the best way to protect your resources.  That seems really counterintuitive.  In a related though, it also seems counterintuitive to me that invading armies can only obtain spoils by finding an enemy military figure and defeating it.  It seems like invading armies should benefit more from ravaging unchallenged parts of the enemy’s territory.    Instead of seeking needed resources, a military figure invades looking for other military figures rather than resources or the like and in fact cannot obtain spoils unless that happens.  Just seems odd to me.

The paths to victory seem unbalanced and that is a bit of a disappointment.  The tech tree seems overweighted.  Purchasing techs requires only one currency, trade.  Trade is fairly easy to accumulate, as you aggregate it from all your cities and it takes no action to harvest it.   If you get the right buildings in place it is not too hard to get a high trade value.  And then the purchasing of techs requires no civil action.  So, it is a powerful combination, you can improve your technology (and get closer to victory) for no civil actions.  It is pretty easy to churn out techs, especially considering the presence of events and abilities like Exchange of Ideas.

I think the culture track could be better.  I think it is too long and expensive to make it a comparable victory condition to the tech tree, or possibly even the military victory (I am not as sure about that).  Moving along the culture takes a lot of actions.  Getting culture is pretty hard and usually resource intensive.  You generally need to either harvest culture directly from a city by using a city action or otherwise need to acquire a good to run through some ability that converts it to culture.  Harvesting from a city takes the city’s whole action and the harvest applies only to that single city (unlike harvesting trade, which is aggregated from all cities).  Further, in the second and third ages, moving along the culture track takes more culture and other resources as well, which makes it even more expensive.  Also, a lot of the culture events are not that great.  Some are ok, but many are not that useful and not enough to compensate for the cost.  

Maybe civilization is a little but like Caylus.  In Caylus, one of the favor tracks is significantly stronger than the others.  Perhaps the tech tree is the strongest way to go and a strong military is essential.  But the advertising of the game was that each path was viable.  Perhaps it is in some games.  I can envision games where no players are militarily aggressive and each person just does his own thing.  In those cases I would think the tech tree would still be the easiest path to victory, but culture might have a bit more of a shot, depending on one’s map.

Best play of BGG.COM 2010 Wed night. I probably got more out of the detailed explanation than the Civ-videogame-virgins did as I taught it.  Was so much like the computer game it almost made me cry.  The rules felt intuitive to me, but I think that's only because of the vast vg experience.

A bit confused after my first play. The game has almost everything that I like (area control, resource management, technological advancement, a bit of direct conflict-although I don't like the battle system that much- and  multiple paths to victory) but, in my opinion, the playing time is too much (almost 4.5 hours for a 2 player game with both of us knowing the rules) for what the game has to offer. I will probably re-evaluate if I play again.

Это первая масштабная игра в коллекции, 32-х страничный мануал несколько пугал, как и описываемое всеми время игры, тем не менее по факту оказалась очень логичная и интересная игра. Она крайне удачно копирует компьютерную версию, а все  механики на своих местах. Если бы не получасовое+ объяснение правил была бы вообще прекрасна.

I have owned this game for about two years now and only had one chance to play it.  The first play through took around 6 hours for 3 players.  

The board game feels so much like the computer game.  However, there is a lot of moving pieces and small mechanics, that in the computer game, are automatically simulated.  

I would rather play a LAN session of CIV, then sit down to play the board game.

I love the way the tech tree works in this game.

The combat is okay, but I don't like how random it can be in the early game, and it can be difficult to replace units in your standing forces. If one player has a disadvantage in production, another player can strip them of all their units by causing battles until they run out, then just take out their capital. They won't be able to replenish their units fast enough without 2-3 high production cities and engineering. Overall, I prefer other combat systems.

I have 2 main issues with this game; the balance between the different victory paths is a bit wonky with just the base game. Finance and military appear to be the only viable victory conditions without the expansion. As soon as someone gets a decent military advantage, they can just win. Otherwise, a financial victory seems to be ~3-5 turns faster than a tech victory, and also faster than a cultural victory. The expansion helps with this issue.

The other issue I have with the game is how much it forces you to specialize in order to win. I prefer games where you can take a more dynamic approach to the strategy. This works well with VP systems, but not with a game like Civ, that has 4 different victory conditions. If you try to do everything, and someone else specializes, they will win unless you kill them first.

RATING: 1
Second epic game after Twilling Imperium. The theme is more pleasing (references are more obvious, also the graphic design cuter), the city building is interesting and paths to victory are diverse and worthy of note. However (we played 3 peaceful nations and 4th one was played peacefully as well) - there was even slower build up to interaction than in TI III. If this could be played in more straight froward, aggressive way (which I heard is the way to play) I'd like this one much better. As of now, I prefer shorter games of this ilk.   

Bloated, interaction happens 1-2 hours in the game. Theme works well. Fun doesn't. 

Rating down to 1.0 - why does this exist? Pile of stuff made for people impressed by pile of stuff. Yippee.

As an avid fan of the computer game, the board version did not disappoint. There was plenty to do and just enough to keep track of. Some comments claim that there is too much going on but there really isn't. It's about what you should be keeping track of in the back of your mind while playing the PC game anyway and the pieces are just fine. Setup is ok, nothing worse then any other FFG game. 

Gameplay is pretty simple and the battle system is a great way to represent the computer version with upgraded units, etc...

All in all a very faithful replica of civ, and very enjoyable.

RATING: 6
Gets a small boost from high quality components but the game is predictable.  The civs all have a strong suit to follow, and sure you can play against theme, but why?  Victory is also easy to spot from several turns out, meaning the endgame devolves into who you want to stop from winning most dictates your last actions.

A Civ game with many things going on. The system isn't overly simplified, but it isn't too complex either. Honestly it doesn't feel like a clash of mighty civilizations, but rather a competition btw. smallish city states. I do understand the reasoning behind this. Otherwise the game could have been unnecessary bloated in many ways.

 The visual style of the components looks very much like the computer game. I felt that victory through other means than military is totally possible, but if another player is really agressive this could prove to be quite hard to achieve. Trade amongst players seems not to be really essential as we really didn't engage in it at all.

Very good game. It has all the glamour of a monster game (complex, takes long, highly thematic etc.) but is really playable. Its quite long, but that is unavoidable, given all the options included.

It 'was a pleasant surprise, that meets the needs of the bellicose signed, it is true that the objectives are unbalanced in favor of the war and the economy, but it is justifiable Egyptians and Romans before building coliseums and pyramids first had to build a army to defend and expand.

Obviously some civilizations are unbalanced: so far the Germans have always won, while Americans and Roman civilizations are more vulnerable situation.

Apart from that, the big drawback (which I also pushed to give it away) is the excessive duration: three hours of play for me is a luxury ...

Kíváncsi voltam a Through the Ages után milyen lesz a Civilization. Féltem, hogy sokkal gyengébb, de kellemesen csalódtam. Kellemes játék a Civilization, élvezetes két személyesen is. Kezdjük a negatívumokkal. Hosszú és talán túl sok a lehetőség is. A hosszúság persze relatív és egy ilyen témával foglalkozó játéknál meg is engedhető, de úgy érzem 4 játékosnál nagyon sokáig tarthat egy parti és a királycsinálás lehetősége bőven adott. A túl sok lehetőség pedig talán kicsit csökkenthető lett volna. Pl. az első játék alkalmával mi csodát nem is építettünk. Épület is túl sok van szerintem, de ez mindenképpen növeli a változatosságát a játéknak. És akkor jöjjenek a pozitívumok. 4 fajta nyerési út, amiből talán egy túl nehéz a többihez képest, de sokfajta stratégiai út járható. Minden játék más, jó a változatos térképelemek felfedezése, nagyon jó a harcrendszer, szinte önálló játék a játékban. Érdekesek a fejlesztések, jó a piramisos ötlet és nyerési út. A jó stratégia a dinamikus fejlődés mindenben, lehet egy ilyetén pontozásvariáns még jobbá tehetné a játékot. Jó játék a Civilization, a TTA dinamikus változásait nem éri el, de megállja a helyét, szívesen játszanék még vele.

[2016-06-12]
Közel öt év után volt újra alkalmam játszani, most a két kiegészítőjével együtt. Nos szinte ugyanazt tudom írni, mint korábban. Ha az alapjáték esetén a sok lehetőséget emeletem ki, akkor a két kiegészítő ezt még komolyabban megemeli és még hosszabbá teszi a játékot. Cserében a győzelmi feltételeket abszolút kiegyenlítettnek éreztem. Hárman-négyen egyrészt rendkívül elnyúlhat, másrészt a királycsinálás nagyon erősen jelen lehet. A játéknak a térkép része ad plusszot a többi civilizációs játékhoz képest (TTA, Nations), de úgy érzem nem jobb náluk. Marad a 7 pont.

We attempted to play this once, the video game being perhaps my favourite PC game of all time, but after spending an hour on set up and trying to understand the rules - we gave up. I have lent the game to friends who managed to play successfully, and said they enjoyed it after getting the hang of it - but it is a learning curve I have yet to master! Fully intend to play and come back to it one day, just finding the time, and the urge, to play again given how much we hit our heads against the table trying to understand the rules the first time - I am sure once you play it is easy, and I tend to update this when we have actually played a few rounds!

Never again. No game -- I repeat, NO GAME -- is worth spending 5 hours of my life. That alone is enough for me to never play it again, but I felt like I spent most of my time waiting for someone to make up their mind about whether to get this technology or that technology that they never really used anyway. One of the other folks in our group said we should have played Fluxx on the side while waiting in the downtime. And in the end, once the leader had set up her trade engine we couldn't catch her anyway, so what was the point?

1 play, 4er.

Seems to do a pretty good job of translating the computer game into board game form, in a very different way than Through the Ages. This does have more of a tech tree than TTA, but it's not exactly a tree but more like a pyramid (no specific prerequisites; just need 2 techs of a lower level). Each player also starts with a randomly assigned starting civ, each with its own advantage. The board is also randomly set up and revealed as you explore. Both these things, esp the starting civ, seem to highly dictate your options.

It seems like I ought to like the game more -- and I'll likely play it at least once more -- but I think I'd almost always rather just play Through the Ages!

RATING: 7
This was the first civ builder board game I've played.  It is basically a watered down version of the video game with a lot of the same theme and mechanics.  In fact just reading the rulebook put me in the mood to play Civ V and I've put between 8-10 hours into that game over the past week alone.  Just one more turn!

So my experience was more good than bad.  First the good.  I love the variable factions, technology tree, component variety, modular map setup, and different paths to victory.  All of this makes for a varied, very replayable game with lots of interesting choices and branching decision trees.  The social interaction is a huge boon as well, I love negotiating, scheming, threatening, and pleading with my opponents across the table.  It's also quite thematic as each faction has certain specialties and you really feel yourself improving over time as you build more advanced buildings and gain new technology and abilities.

But there was a bit of bad too.  First of all the game is long and my first play was made even longer (approaching 5 hours!) by players asking too many questions and taking too much time to take a handful of actions (especially one player in particular).  It's funny because I don't balk at spending 5+ hours playing video games and RPGs but I've figured out that's because I'm constantly doing something.  That's 5+ hours of pretty constant activity.  In this game I timed it and there were instances where I alone was waiting 30 minutes just for my next action which took a couple of seconds.  30 minutes of doing nothing is brutal and when it happens every round it wears on you.

A few of my other complaints involve parts of the system that can't really be changed.  For one there appears to be balance issues, not necessarily with the different factions (though there may be, it wasn't apparent in one play) but one of the most interesting parts of the game is the different victory conditions but they do not appear to be created equal.  Culture in particular seems very difficult to achieve and a military victory seems a little bit easier than the others.  Starting with a military focused faction would give you even more of a head-start.  And while other players can garrison to prevent this that also distracts from them achieving their own victory.  Again though, these are observations from a single play.  Also, I wish the map and movement rules were designed so that in a 4 player game all civilizations were equidistant but each player always has one opponent they are further from than the others due to the square setup and orthogonal movement but this is a minor gripe.  My biggest issue with the game is I quite dislike the combat system.  It is uninteresting, overly convoluted, and kind of stupid.  It doesn't really mimic the video game so it's not an issue of a poor attempt to translate that and with so many tried and true war games to borrow the card- or dice-driven combat systems from I think this was just a failed attempt to do something a little original.

If I ever played this game again, it would have to be under 3 conditions:  1.  This game has a ton of little fiddly components, it should be set up on the table before everyone arrives.  It's one thing if you're not sure you're going to play a game or not but this is something you plan an evening around.  That alone can cut 20+ minutes out of total play time.  2.  Everyone needs to read and, this is the important part, UNDERSTAND the rulebook before you play.  Yes, it is a deep system and yes, some stuff you can only really fully grasp after you play and you will inevitably be asking questions and flipping back through the book.  But my first play had some people asking questions (and sometimes the SAME questions over and over) about very simple concepts in the system that proved they either didn't read the rulebook or didn't understand what they were reading before playing.  3.  All players need to make a concerted effort to have their moves planned out before it is their turn.  Yes, there will be occasions where you need to slow down and consider your options, especially toward the end of the game.  But in a four player game you have 3 other player's turns to have at least made an effort to work out your strategy (not to mention I assume you've spent the whole rest of the game at least working on a guideline of what you're attempting to do) and there is no excuse for 30 minutes of downtime for a player for just one phase of one turn.  There also needs to be a player who understands the game well-enough and has a leadership mentality enforcing these guidelines, especially when it comes to telling players to "Go!"

I bought this game in London 2010. A very expensive game that worked out to be my guilty pleasure for that trip.
Only played one game so far and I'm a bit afraid that I can't convince my fellow players of playing it more because it certainly was too long (over 5 hours) and a bit too predictable despite each player playing with a different civilization. Actually this is my main complaint about the game - players do things in a different perspective but in the end it seems that they've been doing the same thing. There are different strategies to win the game and each one of these have related technologies to use but the most efficient way to play the game and win it seems to be (exactly) the technology tree - one because it's easy to perform (you may do one research each turn or 5 researches each 6/7 turns) two each one of these researches will help players to do better. It's kind of a win win situation. On the other hand, military and cultural victories are not that easy to achieve and I think that if not for the kick of it no player will try to achieve any of them. This is my first and not so solid opinion about the game. I've only played it once!

It's designed by Kevin Wilson (Arkham, Android and Descent) - and I'm hoping that he will bring some magic to this.

And he has! Now played and it feels like Civ. Relatively straightforward rules but huge complexity in the paths to victory and strategies. This has the loads of tokens n cards common to many FF Games, and as such there is a bit of a house style feel to the game. When the house style is applied to some Fantasy setting I don't give two hoots about (the Nurgle, the Snurgggle ,the...whatever) it makes the game difficult to follow because the differences between racial powers, techs etc etc are not intuitive. In Civ the house style works because the powers and techs are intuitive and logical - we 'know' the Russians like stealing technology and the Chines are good at building walls - and we know from years of playing on the Pc game that Pottery inlocks Granaries. Explaining the game to Civ fans is relatively easy, much less so to those not familiar with the Pc Game. The only concepts that the Civ player might go 'What' to are the culture track and the notion of standing forces but command and control armies that wander the map.

I think the game needs to be played aggressively, using your armies to either lay in to the opposition or demand tribute in the trade phase.  However, four pacifists could ignore each other and play the optimisation route. There is a bit of beauty in the game that you can play the game in a style that suits you. I think to play optimally though you need to plan your strategy from the beginning around the Civ. you start with and the resources available in your first 2 cities. 

5th game not so great - Germans, won but multiplayer military issues

6th player sans the Hun, Great game first time i have seen a coin victory

7th with expansion - v quick Greek military victory, level 4 techs ultra fast

8th after a long break...Played with both expansions. Enjoyed playing. However, social policies and Investments just gild the lily - they add a layer of specialisation that I don't enjoy - too hard to see what others are doing, and add focuses the player back on their tableau.

I do like the great leader cards, the new combat, city states and new techs.

Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game is, as it's title implies, a board game implementation of the computer game with the same name. When being set up, the board game even looks like the computer game (which sadly isn't a good thing, as it means that the board is a truly ugly one). The mechanisms of the game, however, feels streamlined and it all seems to make sense when put together. 

Still, the game does nothing at all to excite it's players, which is sad, as the computer games are truly awesome. Thus, even though it is supposed to be a board game implementation of "civ", it does not feel like one.

This game probably deserves more than the 6.5 I am giving it.  It follows the success of Civilization Revolution very closely, It has all the elements of the video game and all three paths to victory.  The Tech tree is well done, the tiles work well, the buildings feel right. The combat rewards both numbers and better tech.   So why is it so meh?  I am not sure.  It just feels a little flat.

This is a good game that disappointed me.  Finally, we had a full-scale, map-based civ game that could be played in a few (okay, maybe 4; 5 at the very most) hours.  Players could bring their unique civilization from the dawn of humanity right through to space flight, while developing their economic, cultural, and military might.  Even the artwork is pretty decent (even if the map army tokens are incredibly boring flag tokens).  And I'll also give props for attempting a unique combat system, although it ends up being a needlessly time-consuming, rock-paper-scissors based model.  However, the game also comes chock-full of the typical Fantasy Flight fiddliness: tons of cards and little cardboard tokens, a zillion little rules to remember, and have I mentioned the fiddly combat system?  But most unforgivably of all, and what ultimately ruins the game for me, is that players are forced to channel themselves down a specific victory path rather than winning based upon building a diverse civilization.  So while this game is still a good option for people who are willing to deal with its quirks and complexities and victory conditions, for my tastes, now that I have Clash of Cultures, I do not feel the need to ever play this game again.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

RATING: 9
Wow this is a fun game.  It does an excellent job of simulating the feel of the Civilization computer game without bogging down in complex minutia of city management and having tons of different unit types.  In other words I think the game is very good at abstracting the elements of the computer game that really are not necessary and retaining the elements that make the game fun.  I think it is brilliant how they implemented building up technologies with the tech "pyramid" system.  That obviates the need for any kind of complicated tech "map" like the computer game has.  Game play is simple after a couple rounds and you do get the feel (somewhat) that you are building up a civilization over time.  The only minor gripes I have are: 1) The game is somewhat fiddly with a lot of counters which creates a long set up time 2) Game play can take a long time, particularly with newer players 3) I get the sense you must choose an initial victory condition to pursue and then you cannot deviate from it or you risk spreading yourself too thin and no longer being competitive.  In other words, I don't see this as a game where you can easily make a mid-game course change and still reasonably expect to win.  I suppose real civilizations are like that, however, it doesn't make the game play as enjoyable/strategic as I would like it to be.  This criticism may not be entirely correct, however, because I have only played the game once.  Further plays will help me flesh out this issue more fully.  Still, I really enjoyed playing the game and look forward to future plays.

Combat is a bit clunky.

[FFG 2010 edition] {Civilization; multiple-goals, variable-player-power, tech-tree; optimal 3-4p}  Civilization games are my favorites.  Thus, I don't need to consider too long to buy this game.  It is a good game for me: the mechanics are novel and interesting; the theme is strong; player interaction is good; it is full of strategic options; it is multifaceted.

The production quality is very good.  Sadly, there are some errors in the rulebook and cards.

A complicated game that takes a long time to play and therefore it will not get to the table very often and thus there will not be a lot of opportunity to try out different strategies. The military path seems particularly difficult because by the time you have built your civilisation up enough to attack the others they are very close to winning.

[German] Sid Meier's Civilization: Das Brettspiel ist ein Monsterspiel, und zwar vor allem deswegen, weil man pro Runde nur eine Aktion pro Stadt hat. Das sorgt für eine interessante Spannungskurve (da das Spiel wirklich die vielfältigsten Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten bietet), aber eben auch für eine lange Spieldauer.

Material und Ausstattung sind sehr gut.

Das Kampfsystem ist gewöhnungsbedürftig, bildet aber auf originelle Weise ein Schere-Stein-Papier-Prinzip (was aber wohl keine große Rolle spielen dürfte, da alle das wissen und deswegen wohl auch keine inhomogenen Armeen aufstellen). Es fehlt eine Übersicht zum Kampfsystem und den diversen Boni.

Wie bei all' diesen Spielen müßte man zunächst mal alle Technologien studieren, um dann gezielt zu forschen.

Wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. 

Had some misgivings about the use of land tiles rather than an actual map of the world but the tiles add interest and a sense of discovery.

Also like the use of the technology pyramid though not having the direct link of specific technologies as in a technology tree will be a disappointment for some seasoned Civ enthusiasts.

The battle mechanic is perfect for this game. It's quick and easy based on paper scissors stone but leaves enough scope for tactical and even strategic play.

Will easily play in 3 hoursonce players are familiar with the game.

Overall, this game plays a lot better than I expected.

RATING: 6
So, i really like this but I think they dropped the ball on the combat system which is starting to really annoy me now. sometimes I fell like they might as well have told you to play rock, paper, scissors every time there was a fight. 
 
 But the rest of the games good enough to (at the moment) make up for it.

*edit*

 After a single game of Clash of Cultures I think  might be done with Sid Meier's. bit of a shame as I've had some fun games, but Clash solves the things I don't like about it and looks prettier on the table. 

*edit2*
Yep. Sid Meier's is gone.

Captures the feel of the computer game very accurately. Unfortunately, it kind of feels a little repetitive -- not a ton of really logical decisions to make, but I could get over that.

The thing I CAN'T get over is the HORRIBLE combat system. I guess they wanted to get away from dice and everything, but the combat system is so clunky and convoluted for no reason. I would have much rather had a dice-fest than this atrocity. Maybe after a ton of games I might get used to it and understand its "nuances," but eh... just feels overly complex for what it needed to be.

It would be awesome if an expansion could come out and revamp the combat system since it really feels tacked on.

I bought this game and... sold it even before unpacking. Of course, without playing I have no real opinion about it. But, after reading the rulebook and many web comments, reviews etc., I feel I'm not interested in. Too long play, too many components, too many small rules interacting in a fiddly manner. I'm afraid that my closest friends would be bored listening me presenting the game. The fighting mechanics looks odd and artificial, also too long (as it is 1p vs 1p, other guys are waiting). There are also many significant random factors involved: the fighting units strength, resources (uranium!), culture event cards, a starting wonder for Egyptians and others. The builings and great persons are very similar: they are just boosting a little the culture/trade/production. Generally, I have a feeling that the game offers nothing new, except of some mechanic elements that are rather mediocre.

What a disappointment. I was super hyped for this game, though slightly worried that it displayed the usual hallmarks of Fantasy Flight's cardboard over-indulgence and rules inelegance. 

Admittedly, I have not played it the prescribed "5 times", but the game seems to "small" to not turn into an arms-race, forcing everyone not investing in military tech, units and armies, to either lose or follow suit. In essence, it feels like a turn-based RTS (which the tank-rush-tactics of yore) rather than a mini-version of the PC game.

I would much rather play Through the Ages or Eclipse - both which have design considerably more elegant in my view.

Gah! ... So many moving parts. I knew when I sat down to play this that I couldn't possibly win. That was no problem. But ten minutes into its 3 hours I knew that I wouldn't win my tenth game. Unless you're a super quick study of game mechanics I could see this taking a lot of plays to get up to speed with opponents with experience.

Full disclosure: I've never played any incarnation of civ building video game, let alone the video game that this board game was based on.

RATING: 9
I was a big fan of Through the Ages, but for me, this game improves on that game in many ways. It is more streamlined, easier to teach, has less AP, and you don't have to wait minutes for your turn.

Yes, Through the Ages probably has deeper game play, but this version of Civ has a lot of options in it. With 4 ways to win it gives you a lot of variety.

With the inclusion of a map and culture cards, plus limited buildings, Civ also gives more interaction between the players.

It is abstract in some ways, but not as much as Through the Ages. I also feel that this game is closer to the PC game than Through the Ages also, except that Through the Ages makes you balance your resources more.

Right now, I think this is the best Civ game I've played. This may change if I ever get to play the original game.

I played many different board games in my life, and most of then I played a lot. But I have never played a game as good as Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game. First of all, the box and the components are awesome. The quality of all tokens, map tiles, figures and cards is excelent. Even the manual has a high quality standard. For the game price, it's crazy. Also, the game is gorgeus. It's impossible to stay impassible to the board when the game is set up, even my wife that understand nothing from these games spend some time just looking to the table when the game is there.

But the best part is yet to come. The game is absolutely awesome. I read most of the negative comments here, and clearly most people played the game 1 time (some even less!). 1 user gave a bad rate and said that the combat should be decided in a throw of the dice... crazy.

The rules are detailed, but very intuitive. Of course, you'll need to play the game 3-5 times to play it perfectly without looking the manual once, until you get the hang of it. But which complex game isn't like this? Basically, the turn is divided in 5 steps:

1 - Build new cities and/or change government;
2 - Collect trade;
3 - City Action;
4 - Movement;
5 - Research tech.

The four paths to victory are balanced well enough, but this will be VERY affected by the way your group plays. If your players always go for economic wins, for example, you may think that the economic win is overpowered and unbalanced... but this is not the case. Just check the forum, there are groups complaining that tech, militar, culture and economic victories are overpowered... if all are overpowered, none is.

The combat of the game is simple, but strategic. There is little randomness involved, so you must be prepared to attack and to defend. There is surprise enough with the randomness involved (size and power of your army) and with the culture cards, there is also surprise enough. This, with the tech resource abilities, make the battle very pleasant and thrilling.

The game is played between 150 to 180 minutes. The game is 80% played simultaneously by all players, so it does not get boring and you are always thinking and planning.

In general, there is not much randomness involved in the game, which is great. I don't to play a 3 hour strategic game that in the end was decided by luck.

Just get it and play. I haven't played a better game in my life.

Looking forward to seeing what the new 2013 expansion add to the battle mechanics.  Couldn't be as bad as the original verion, I'm hoping.  Otherwise, the game play, and artwork mimics the computer version pretty well.  Several paths to victory, and a large number of unique races, definitely gives this game replayability... if it wasn't for the battles... :(

RATING: 6
Surprisingly entertaining. I say surprising because heavily thematic Fantasy Flight games are not typically to my liking.

Civilization is probably too long, and the tech trees add complications that are going to take you a while to learn, but the game played smoothly. With multiple paths to victory, you can choose to focus your particular civilization on a handful of areas. For example, in my first game, I one by building up my military faster than the other players. In my second game, I won again (not that I'm showing off!) by building up my tech tree. You'll have to focus on something, so the game encourages you to try different strategies from game to game. I question how flexible you can be if, for example, you see that another player is concentrating on the same area, but at least it's nice to feel that there is real variety.

Overall, I also like the battle system. It gives a huge advantage to the attacker (which is a nice change from most games), but is brisk and tactical without being overly luck based. Each player has a hand of cards, which the play one at a time in a simplified maneuver/matching game. I'm not fully enamored with the card play as it feel like a mini game within a game that can be either distracting or else obvious without adding much strategy. However, it's unique and does not overstay its welcome.

On the other hand, I will say that battles are very decisive -- maybe too much, or at least so much so that military action is a better deterrent than viable strategy unless you are willing to go all in. You simply have to engage in an arms race if for no other reason than to protect what you've built. So while the battle system is overall interesting, the military aspect of the game is a touch too powerful.

Civilization then is a good game, certainly worth a handful of plays. With a game like Scythe available now, I'm not sure Civilization has the luster it once had, but if you're the type of person who wants a bigger tech tree and a larger focus on military battles, then this may be the game for you.

They do a decent job capturing the feel of the computer games.  Some of the mechanics feel a little weird to me, and you can get screwed by the initial army distribution.  It's fun to play, but doesn't compare to a lot of other games that take 3+ hours.

I'm going to start this with a 7 rating, but I expect it will move from there ... whether up or down, I'm not sure. On the plus side, this is a big, sweeping adventure that is pretty true to the feel of the computer game while carving out its own space as a board game. The paths to victory seem pretty abundant and balanced, and there's so much going on that the game should remain interesting and challenging for some time. Some small initial concerns include game length (if a four-player game can actually be completed in three hours as advertised I'll be OK with this) and civilization balance (the folks who taught me the game wouldn't allow anyone to play Russia because it is "too powerful"). Need to play more, but I'm optimistic this game will prove to be a "keeper."

This game "insta-wowed" me. The only concern I might have is that it is long. BUT - it never felt like it was. Not a single second, in which you didn't seem involved or you weren't interested in what was happening over at your opponent's civilization. There's just so much going on all the time. Interactivity is at an all-time high including trade negotiations and tons of "Kettenrasseln", which would be best translated by cold war conduct. But it differs from i.e. TI 3rd edition, in that it does not remain cold through most of the game, but is bound to happen quite often without the big initial bang that everyone is lurking for and then starts, but you have to be agressive and then again mild with your oppenents throughout all the game. 

And then there's the myriad of points, Kevin Wilson perfectly converted from the computer game to the board game:
- The tech trees
- stealing techs (althoughthat's just the Russians)
- the Wonders
- the adjustment of the cities as towards what their production shall be focussed on
- the victory conditions (Technology victory, Trade victory, Culture victory, military victory)
- the personalities
- the resources
.
.
.

Plus a combat system that is both unique and feliticious.
 
I could rave about how great this game is and the fantastic initial impressions it left me with and that I still didn't put to words as I'm still not done recalling them all, when really everything I'd love to do is to play it again. If it is civilization-building you want, this is THE place to go.

Interesting and relatively fast for a civilization game, and multiple paths to victory that don't simply involve different ways to get points. There is so much going on with every card and tile that it's a massive mental undertaking for me just to focus on one of the paths.

This game's rating is slowly sinking for me. It has some fun aspects, but the fiddly parts of the rules, the unintuitive combat mini-game, and the plethora of resources and stats to track wear on my opinion.

One play, four player.  One guy was foolish and stopped playing halfway through.  The rest of us all finished different victory conditions within the scope of a single turn.  Well balanced (despite losing two cities to nukes, I was still in it) and fun.  I want to play again.

Trying to keep all major points of the computer version hurts this game more than it helps. It is not that complex, but large amount of details results in extreme fiddlyness with all that bits, chips, cards and tedious bookkeeping of your towns' production, which all was done automatically in the computer variant.

With four mostly linear paths to victory, choices feel rigid and mechanical, and scope of the game is very limited. It does not feel like your empire sprawls, gets more powerful or evolves over time, which leads to unsatisfying experience.

+ Comes with all the trappings of the video games. Familiar buildings, wonders, great people, etc.

+ The tech pyramid is super cool. The techs get extremely powerful at the top, but you only get to use a couple of them each game, which leaves you wanting to try the others out.

Nice, distinct powers for each of the civilizations give them their own flavor; however, this can lead to feeling a bit rail-roaded towards a particular strategy.

- The battle system is a step above rolling dice but still a mess. Huge, randomly determined power swings between units. Interesting rock/paper/scissors system but not enough cards (randomly drawn each combat) to do anything but add some additional luck.

- Extremely theme first design. The game is a mess of a mechanics with little connection between them. This manifests itself as a lot of little rules to explain delivered via a poor rulebook.

- Squares instead of the standard hexes. Presumably another theme first design choice, given that hexes didn't make it to the video games until the fifth entry.

A pretty poorly designed game hidden behind a great license. After a couple of plays, the novelty of the license wore off and the mechanics don't stand up. Traded away.

I just wish this felt more like a grand Civ building game than a mad dash to the finish line.

Clash of Cultures is a much better Civ building game imo if you want more of a drawn out feel.

This game is just setup a combo and grind it to the victory condition as fast as possible, which just feels...not right and not like building a Civilization.

Although Through the Ages still holds the spot for my favorite Civ game, this game comes close. I really love the fact that there are four different routes to victory and that they all seem pretty close to being achieved by at least one player every game. It seems a little tricky to get your economy going in this game, however once I did I found myself wishing that there was more to it.

Awesome game! I loved it from start to end. It really feels like you're somehow playing the PC version. It's awesome flavour-wise, it's captivating, really makes you wanna play more each time, cause of course the more you know the cards, the more you imagine tactics. It's quite complex, but it's more frightening than problematic. Fact is, it is a slow game, so don't try it the first time if you don't have like 4 hours minimum.

I love nearly every aspect of this game.  Being a long-time fan of the video game series probably doesn't hurt, but this game easily stands on its own merits.  My favourite part is that this is one of the few strategy games with asymmetric factions that REALLY makes each faction feel completely different.  Surely, one of them is overpowered - but WHICH one, they all seem overpowered!!  Sure, the victory conditions are not terribly well-balanced - for example, an economic win is FAR more viable than a Culture win - but to me, the hallmark of a good game is one where I discover MORE options every time I play.  So far, this has invariably been true of Civilization.

Rating Without Wisdom and Warfare expansion: 5

Epic, civbuilding game. The sense of completion/progress you get as you proceed through this game is great, as are most of your ingame decisions. The starting civs do make a difference in your strategies, and the level of choices you have at every level is staggering in a good way. I think that with the expansions, this game is the best civilization game with a map, easily.

I can't see how this can be finished in under 3-4 hours, unless of course you have a highly trained (and not prone to analysis paralysis) group. It's too much for two players, good with 4, even better with 3. Although luck is not an option, the game is somewhat prone to kingmaking, though less so with experienced players. The ways to victory also seem unbalanced, unless someone has both expansions apparently.

Overall this is a great modern game, provided of course that you include at least wisdom and warfare. Without it, the ridiculous randomness of the armies and the unbalance of the victory conditions ruin for me the game almost completely.

RATING: 7.5
One play so far. I played as the Americans and James played as the Germans. He went for the military victory and I ended up winning with the cultural victory. This is a great game that really captures the feeling of the Civ computer games and I really enjoyed it, but the cultural events seem way too powerful. It remains to be seen if this power is negated by 3 or 4 players taking part.

**UPDATE**

This is a great game but in true FFG style there are many rules inconsistencies that tarnish an otherwise excellent game. I've had two games where I've been able to win that turn but because of turn order I've been denied a win. The tie-breaker variant in the first official FAQ solves this somewhat, but there are a load more questions that need to be answered. Hopefully Civ gets an Arkham Horror style rewrite. At this point- it needs it.

Having said that though, I still love the game and am prepared to put up with minor inconsistencies. If the major ones were fixed, that would be great.

[i]Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game[/i] captures the spirit of the Civilization computer games, even if it is a little light in some parts. The game should not be considered competition to deep, in-depth civilization building games, as the game is much shorts and lighter than many of that kind. However, it is a fully-accessible and fun game that can be played in three hours. Deep micromanagers will not have that itch satisfied by this game, but those who like map exploration and city building portions of empire building games will find that this game will charm them with a fun experience.

What I like: 

-This game is so epic. It's so goddamn satisfying advancing your civilization in this - so many upgrades and the way you see your empire expand on the actual board instead of just in an abstract manner - It's so satisfying. 
-4 completely unique paths to victory makes this so interesting. Also like that each civilization has their own unique features. 

What I dislike:
-The plaaaaaaaaaying time! Oh my, this game just takes forever. I do NOT recommend playing this without someone at the table knowing the rules perfectly - if you have to look up stuff during your plays this might take you all day
-The AP is so ridiculously strong in this one - The thing is, since you know everything that is and will be available to you, you can literally plan out your entire game! And you kinda have to! And don't you dare stray from your original strategy - if you planned to go for culture or gold or science you better darn well stay on that path, cause otherwise you've just declared yourself completely lost. The progress you made in one field does not translate to others (which makes sense), so you can't really switch strategy mid-game. This is the kind of game where you could easily plan the entire game out before you even started playing. 
-Since expanding with more cities is so important, you can get screwed abit if you draw poor tiles early game to get your extra cities in.

There's a bit going on in Civiliation: The Board Game, and on my initial play, I felt a little bit lost.  I think I did reasonably well, but I know that I'd have a better idea what to do the second time around.  

Overall I thought the game was very good.  I'm not sure I love the combat system though.  That was the one part of the game that really felt strained to me.

RATING: 6.5
It has many neat things: how the combat cards works, the tech tree is great, the pieces are good (but the map is weird). The game allows for several ways to win: military (conquering the capital of other player), economic (reaching 15 coins), cultural (reaching the end of the track) and technologic(developing the level 5 tech) - all doable, though, with the base game only, the cultural one is pretty hard to achieve.

It has problems (I would like the trade aspect to be bigger, more in line with the old Civilization), but, nonetheless, for me it is the best modern civilization game. And in all of my games, in the last turn, at least two players have a chance of winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
This was brutal to learn and try to play without forgetting stuff. And I don't see anything of interest to the game.

What drew me to the game (aside from liking the earlier Civ computer games) was the modular board. The size scales by number of players, but in a 4p, there are 16 boards in play, four of which start revealed, and up to eight more of which might be revealed halfway through the first turn. Such a fast rate of exploration of the world feels quite unlike Civ on a computer.

Aside from the modular board, you have a standardish multiplayer conquest game and some standardish not overly complicated economy building. Player interaction is mostly in the former component and there isn't much subtlety to it. There are four ways to win: One is by conquering another player's capital, and the other three all involve using your economy to work your way up what are essentially just tracks (culture, economic, or technology). Nothing promising about any of this, just lots of tedious economic bonuses to remember and an asinine combat system (a card system that probably could've just been a dice system, except that the tech tree demands some unit differentiation).

Almost every tech card (you just get a deck of tech cards per player) offers a special power, and acquiring "culture" cards usually gives you some (unthematic) take-that ability. Upon these realizations and also having finished discovering the board, my patience with the game was exhausted.

I don't think 4X is a promising genre for boardgames. Exploration is inherently too unpredictable, and it seems like much of the expanding and exploiting is meant to be played as MPS.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.99
Good adaptation of the computer game.  I recommend playing with player aids showing the buildings, wonders and tech abilities, especially for those players not near the buildings and wonders.
I have not played a full game with 3 or 4 players yet, although I have played 1/3 or 1/2 with 3 players twice.  Most of my plays are 2-player.  As a 2-player game, this is a 10.  As a 3 or 4-player game, probably a 7 or 8 due to the added length.

One incomplete 2 player demo game and already I think it will become one of my favorite games.   I love Through the Ages and this reminds me of that without being so abstract.  I like the modular board layout and having actual army units moving around the board.

Played a 2nd game and am concerned about being in last place and having no way of catching up.  Not sure if it's a design/game flaw or the way I played.  Willing to give it more tries.

Can't wait to get more plays of this.  Playing time is the only issue I see as it might be too long to play more than a couple times a year.

Really loving this game.  My 10 year old son also took a fancy to it and we are playing it together.  We tied our 1st game with each getting the tech tree done on the same turn, but the 2nd game I surprised him with a military victory while he was going for an economic victory (he thought I was going tech again).

Suffers the same problem as TTA: Too much is going on and to few of those things interest me. There should be no problems if all players are doing their turns simultaniously.
Very much multiplayer solitaire although this term is somewhat overused.
Neverthless this game is very good designed, has good mechanics and there is some interaction by military. Unfortunatley i think there would be no problem if every player has his own gameboard and plays for himself and after 150 minutes one declares himself as winner.

Rating after two plays with two and four players. The game probably really is an "unplugged" version of the Civilization Revolution boardgame. On one hand, there are a lot of ways to get a Euro-style victory engine going, on the other there seem to plenty of ways (mainly through cardplay) to annoy your fellow players. Otherwise, player interaction is taking a backseat in this game. There is plenty to keep track of, but since the game itself is pretty straightforward, I found the rules easy to remember. All in all, it is one of the best first time experiences I had with an FFG game - about the same as I had with Arkham Horror and Chaos In The Old World. On my first play, I already liked it better than the well-received Runewars. For me, the only real drawback of this game is its long(!) playing time.

A loooong game. Even when we totally understood the game, the pace was slow. We were 4 hours into the game and still midway through. The game is Fantasy Flight fiddly but captures the overall CIV theme quite well. I enjoyed the exploration and city building part but am lukewarm about the battle mechanics. We had one souped up pikemen beat tanks with the use of a tech special event. Something which does not quite make sense. The culture track was a good addition to the game. 

Overall, the game is fun and engaging but the length of the game is prohibitive. Therefore, the ranking won't be going up the roof.

RATING: 5
I was quite dissapointed with the game. It had surprisingly many superficial similiraties to the computer game (which I like a lot) but I don't thimk these choices work optimally in a board game... 

The main problems I had with the game:
- the production/trade/culture collection mechanism (around your cities) was very boring. Calculating each time the same stuff felt just very unelegant and teadious.
- The combat was very abstract and not at all satisfying. 
- If you don't get to build your second city very early, you are basically out from the game.
- I believe that the higher level techs, units etc, don't have too much effect in the game. If one of the players is able to develop those techs, the game is so close to the end that players cannot really use these too much. The game doesn't really therefore span the whole history of the world.
- The wonders were very uninteresting and weak. As the early ones were too expensive to build, the more powerful ones didn't even come to play in our game.

My main problem for me in the game was however that the game didn't feel like proper epic civilization building game. It just didn't feel that I was building huge civilization, nor that each turn would take hundreds of years. Maybe it was because the high level of abstraction? The tech pyramid had some nice new idea (although many techs just felt superior) and was maybe the best part in the game IMHO.

I loved Civ IV. I love Civ V. I TOTALLY love this board game. Bit harsh to understand rules, but 1 or 2 games are you are in business. TO BUY !!

There is many ways you can win. War, culture, technology, economy. Depends on your own preferences and on your civilization bonuses.

Loved the old Avalon hill Civilization.  I hope this is like a streamlined version of that that plays well with two.  I read the game takes 3 hours even with two.  While this is streamlined from the original version's 8 hour play time it still would be too long for casual play.  Meaning we might only get it to the table once or twice a year.  There are probably other games that would be a better fit for us.

Got it: Kathy's copy. I'm certain we'll enjoy it ([-]especially with the expansions[/-]). Not sure where those will go. Perhaps.

What a difference a game room makes. :/ You really have to keep the winning conditions in mind too. [i]We keep the rules handy, 'cuz we are constantly forgetting how to play.. even after days of playing.[/i] BGG Player Aids to the rescue, again! Need more plays, but I think I'll be enjoying it mostly for the experience, rather than any ultimate win. It's fun trying. Tends to drag on, near the end... especially, if you know the outcome.

This game is a huge bargain.  You really get a lot for the money.

It is probably the best designed FFG game I have played, simply because randomness has a minimized role.  In my opinion, long games should never be decided by chance.

The instructions are actually a bit lacking.   There is an unofficial faq in the forums, but a number of common questions are still unanswered.  This isn't really a surprise, because there are so many different techs that there are bound to be some complex interactions between them.

My biggest complaint so far is that military seems to be unstoppable.  One player is bound to try for a different type of victory, and their capital will be smashed by someone that researches military.

I wasn't this excited to play a game since the release of [gameid=20551], or maybe even ever.  Intially, the game met and even exceed my expectations.  Fantasy Flight managed to turn the Civilization franchise into something that suits its strengths perfectly.  Components are great, decisions are juicy, and the computer game is mimicked very well, both in terms of mechanics and in terms of feel.  The exploration is there, followed by the midgame conflict, and finally the endgame maximization for victory conditions.  

As we've gotten better, further plays have revealed a ruthless and irreversible snowball effect.  Good luck with the tiles, army draw, or barbarians will set up a runaway leader, and bad luck or a mistake is impossible to recover from.  All of our recent games have seen half of the players effectively eliminated within the first four turns.  The expansions don't offer any help here.  Both of them rebalance the victory conditions, but they make an early lead even more powerful, and the midgame devolves into a quick coronation of the early leader via a military steamroller, economic, or culture victory.

Alas, Civ, for what might have been.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I knew ahead of time that this wasn't really my type of game, but I'm glad I got to play it once. Player elimination is certainly an issue, as I was so irrelevant by the one third mark, the other three players were forgetting to let me take my turn, and would skip right on by me. The map exploration is over way too quickly, I'd like that part of the game to last way longer. The tech tree system is very well done, simple but easy to do, and can be quite varied from game to game.

I knew what I was getting in to with this game, but I'm not sure how I feel about it at this point.  It's not the length (though that certainly doesn't hurt), but there's an awful lot that players need to know about the game when playing it to do well at it.  I like the way that the technologies affect what you can build, but to get your engine running efficiently, you have to know what all of the technologies do at the start of the game.  That's not a criticism, necessarily, but it does slow down the progress of the game with new players, and means that it takes a few games to really get how it all works.  This was the case with Through the Ages, but when I finished playing that game for the first time, I came away thinking that I had just played an extraordinary game.  After playing Civilization, I feel like this is just an OK game.  Maybe future playings will make the difference, though.

First impressions are very good! This rating might go up after more plays. (Though I suspect some civs are better than others, and some wonders seem to suck - stonehenge -while others, like hanging gardens, rock.)

Update: Rating down 1 point. The victory conditions don't seem balanced. Culture is very hard and prone to being shut down by opponents, economic victory is safe and very, very fast. In fact, economic victory strikes me as being the go-to victory condition. Which is unfortunate, because it's a very boring way to win. This game needs to be "fixed" by an expansion.

Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people’s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.
\13\\13\
In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!
\13\\13\
Fans of Sid Meier’s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play, Civilization: The Board Game captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.
\13\\13\
Players start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.

I wanted to buy a boardgame version of the Videogame and i got exactly that. 
It delivers what its meant to do.

Pro: 
-It does what civ (expecially civ revolution) does. Its the videogame condensed in a boardgame

-huge variety and real 4x (can win with lot of different tactics)

-No dominant strategy and a strategic complexity far superior to most eurogames

-visually appealing

-lot of different civs with different tactics

Con:

-Long setup (not extremely long but still long)

-Duration (realistically 3 hours or little more)

-LOT of rules

-combat system is bad (thanks god its a 4x and its not mandatory).



If you are looking for a table version of the game, this is still the way to go.
If you are into old style eurogames, this might not being a good choice (too complex and even small interaction requires constant adaptation like the VG). 

expansions are highly recommended.

I know [b][i]Civilization: The Board Game [/i][/b]will be a dream design for some people, but I'm not one of them. I've never played [i]Civ[/i] (or almost any other PC game) on the computer, so I came at this game cold and it felt like I had to slaughter a cow myself just to get the burger I wanted. So many details, so many bits, so much to remember – yet so little of interest given the weight of what's involved when playing.

In other fora I've expressed unbridled excitement over Carl Chudyk's [i]Innovation[/i], a card game with a civilization gloss on its wildly interactive and fun design. While lacking in thematic realism, [i]Innovation[/i] provides me with far more game play for far less work than this game.

This game is really fun. I love the variability in the civiizations, but the real key thing about this game is the multiple paths to victory. It also manages to have relatively little downtime for a game that is so long and heavy, and it IS quite heavy: so many rules and systems to keep track of. It loses some points for combat, which sort of throws off the pace of the game.

This is a game that my group really enjoys.  We love the replay value and just have a good old fashioned fun time when we play.  Love it.  Word of advice:  If you are just thinking of starting with this game, feel free to get the expansions at the same time if you want, but they are not necessary at all.  And if you do decide to get expansion(s) at the start of your Civ career, at least play a few games without them first.  The game is rather rules heavy… so start slowly and add them in.

As a very old player of Civilization on PC, it's nice to have such kind of game. But it feels too much artificial and not boardgame-ish. Through The Ages is so much better as civilization game - because it takes away unneeded stuff and focuses on what really matters. And if I'm looking for big good game with big map, then there's no match for Twilight Imperium in every aspect. And there's more games executing it better what Civilization tries to do. So while it is not bad, it is not good enough to stand out from other games around.

RATING: 8
it is too long and complicated to be a game I like very much. That said, my first game was an epic experience. 2 hours of explanation, 5,5 hours of game, with a final turn with all of us would have won and the culture victory won over two tech ones.
The game is very rich and complex but it flows quite well with limited down time (for what it is). Unfortunately, it requires too much time and I doubt I will play it soon again.
We followed 3 completely different path to victory and the final result is sooo amazing and this to me is very important.

It is very difficult to rate this game because I think it is a very good game in its genre, but also, I don't like it because it is so difficult to put it on the table, due to lenghty rules and playing time. So, is a good game that I will play once in a life actually a good game? I don't know. For now, I am giving it an 8.

Very tentative rating after one 3-player session. Interesting mix of heavy Euro elements - multiple resource tracking and purchase of tech upgrades. The latter in particular (and its interaction with the resource pools) felt a lot like Wallace's "Rise of Empires". Wargame elements such as there are (build up of units, and combat mini game) feel tacked on. Lots of little surprises in the game - build a steam boat, and you can land a capitol invasion to win a quick war victory - that reward rules mastery.

Good game, but if pressed for a deep 3-4 hour multiplayer session I'd rather play either a full on wargame or the aforementioned Rise of Empires.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game is pretty darn fun. But, it's pretty easy to get completely wiped out, either by an early barbarian or by a hostile neighbor. If you lose a bunch of your army, and then lose a city, it's pretty much GG.


-------------------------
Rating based on first 2 player game. Russia vs. Germany. Germany rolled over my awesome Russian 2nd city, and it was pretty much game over at that point. But, does feel like the PC game, the techs are interesting, and there are a ton of choices for what to do each turn. One city action per turn feels a bit limiting. Expect rating will increase.

Comment after initial play - Any incredibly elegant game - but just not a very "fun" one.  In our game, one of the players happened along two great person cards which allowed him to take off.  Each turn he grew exponentially stronger and the rest of us played really solid turns but could do nothing.  Unfortunately, this game is simply too prone to leaving many of its players feeling like they are going to be playing for 2-3 hrs knowing they are going to lose.

Great components, highly intelligent gameplay, great variability - but not entirely engaging or fun.  C+

Well, where to start? I love playing civilization on the computer and I am totally excited for CIV6. 
So, of course I had to buy and play the boardame as well. It is a very nice conversion of the PC-Version but there are many cons to get this on the table again after two times of playing. 
If I want to play CIV I'd rather play it on the computer with some friends via Steam and Teamspeak. There are too many fantastic boardgames out there that should be played instead of this one.

RATING: 3
I really thought I might like this one... but my first experience was *really* bad.  (not really the games fault... I had trying to learn a game from someone reading the rules out loud for the very first time).

If you like Sid Meier's computer game this will certainly feel familiar... but I certainly spent our whole session wondering why I wasn't just playing on the computer.  That being said the special resource aquisition is neat, the combat seems potentially more strategic than it first appears from the "rock paper scissors" mechanic, and the tech tree is just great.  However, I will never be a fan of long games with high potential for player elimination... so I'm not sure how keen I will be to give this one another shot.

A fun game, hampered by generally knowing if you're going to lose about half way through, and still needing to finish it. Play with people who have the time and will to win, and not prone to king make.

Excellent game. Keeps a lot of flavor from the video games.

Está bien, y en cierta medida se mantiene parte del espíritu, pero se queda a medias de ser un gran juego. Duración excesiva para lo que ofrece. Aún así, está bien. No me gustan los multijugadores... :(

Traded Chateau Roquefort, FITS, Sid Meier's Civ, and Quarriors for Crokinole.

Sometimes mechanics borrowed from VG don't work well with board games. I prefer TTA much, much more.

Overall a good game, but I still prefer the PC version. And sometimes the downtime is killing.

A super-meaty civ-building game with four distinct independent win conditions and variable player powers. Win by conquering the other players (of COURSE this had to be one), cultural development, economic power, or technological advancement.

Combat is based on a simple diceless(yay!) card system which allows for simple but strong power upgrades.

My favorite 3-hourish game so far.

The boardgame repeats many features and nuances from the computer game series admirably. Yet there is very little bookkeeping or tedious calculation, which is even more admirable, considering the mechanics of the computer game. Simple rules but many strategies, thanks to all the special abilities of the different civilizations, technologies and such. Just like the computer game, Sid Meier's Civilization The Boardgame always makes you want to play just one more game.

RATING: 8
When I win I want the other players to appreciate my genius (!), but with this game you've got your head down looking at your own tech cards and civ sheet most of the time. As a side note, the same criticism can be levelled at RftG, but at least it is a quicker paced game and richer in gameplay for me. Otherwise a nice game.

Edit 26-11-11: Familiarity with the game makes you feel more on top of all the different paths to victory. Liking it better after 5-6 plays.

Zagrożeniem dla Cywilizacja: poprzez wieki nie jest. Natomiast poza tym jest to całkiem sympatyczna gra, ładnie wydana i z (jak na tak dużą grę) całkiem zgrabnymi regułami i krótkim czasem rozgrywki (3-4h wydają się być spokojnie wystarczające nawet na czteroosobową rozgrywkę).
Nie działa na 2 osoby (tzn. działa, ale jest mało atrakcyjna).

After 2 plays I like it. I like that it resembles the CIV franchise a lot and actually provides what is expected from a Civilizations game.

Fair warning: This is a long game. With many components. And a long set up time. Even with our first game (2 players) taking almost 4 hours, my wife enjoyed it and we played a second time. It nails some of the aspects of the computer game very well and could merit an evening of playing.

After 2+ Plays: I'm not in love with it, but I definitely liked it. I think I'll try to stick to 3 players in the future. The fourth person seems to add time but no more fun.

This game would get a higher rating if it would have a better combat system.

To complex for what it is.
To much micromanagement. Its a big Puzzle.
Plays not as a game. Its more working because all administration. Better play the computer game.

Clash of Cultures bumped this out. Too cumbersome and combat feels like a tack-on

Весьма рядовая игра с кучей несвязанных друг с другом, но сбалансированных рабочих механик. Самой цивилизации я тут не вижу. Всего понемножку - немного исследования поля, чуть-чуть городов, слегка войны, в норме науки, ну и сови механики для культуры, товаров и прочего барахла. Это работает, но Сид Мейер тут не ночевал.

Could have been a lot worse, but some wonky design choices and serious slog bar it from being worth the time. Totally obsoleted by Through the Ages (who cares about the map?).

I'm very pleased with this game.  The PC game was notorious for the "just one more turn" addiction, and this game gives me the same urge -- "just one more game"!  As soon as I'm done, I want to play it again.

Excellent game.  Several plays and each one has seen most, if not all players, within reach of the win - all through different routes.
Plenty of choices to make throughout, just a top game.

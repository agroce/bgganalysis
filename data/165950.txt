GAME: Beasty Bar
RANK: 1061
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Beautiful big cards with great artwork; a fun theme; clever gameplay with memorable actions (the kangaroo jumps over other animals; the crocodile eats them etc...) and a short duration all combines to make a brilliant confrontational filler game.

RATING: 6.5
If guillotine and parade had a love child than beasty bar would be it. This is a light card game where you are trying to get as many of your deck of 12 different animals into the "heavens gate" night club as possible. The rules are easy, the iconography even easier, definitely worth having in my collection.

Love this game. Almost replaces Guillotine for me, but G has a higher player count, so they both stay. But picking between the two I'll go with Beasty Bar.

RATING: 6.5
I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

As I was asked to play Beasty Bar, I was not so enthusiastic. The artwork looked really weird! I didn't like the style of the drawings and even more the subjects of them... these humanized animals just didn't work for me. As I sat down and played the game, I quickly had to change my mind, because Beasty Bar is actually a fun game and even the theme is kinda neat. The gameplay is simple, but it has a good depth actually. I like a lot the fact that with such a small amount of cards you can create some very cool combos... as a matter of fact I find this absolutely brilliant!

The interaction between the players is high, there's a lot of tactics available and the game is portable enough. I still would like it better with a different style of art, but overall a very solid card game.

I LOVE the thick, hefty cards (that are even larger than tarot sized), as well as the art (which does include a skunks puckered asshole). The base game is swingy fun and the advanced version adds a little bit of metagaming to the mix and is fantastic. LOVE this as a bar game.

Guillotine for gamers.  Tighter design with more interesting decisions, but ultimately a lot of luck. Has a memory component in that it helps to remember which of their limited set of cards each person has already played, although this could be alleviated by spreading the discard piles out on the table. A nice, fairly short filler.

The production values are good, and the cards are chunky and colourful. However, I found the card art showing sleazy renditions of animals off-putting.

Adorable card game, you're lining up a number of different animals to get into the 'Heaven's Gate' bar, but they each have abilities that can change the order of the line or boot other animals (or themselves) so they get kicked out completely. Players score for how many animals were able to get into the bar by the time their decks run out. A clever idea, fun filler and the art and theme are good to make folks laugh.

This game is so silly that I am finding myself continually reaching for it. It's nice for a Take That game to feel so well crafted, and while I don't know that many people will rush over for a chance to play this one, there's just enough strategy in the screwage that it offers to somewhat satisfy a Gamer with what is otherwise just a mean, ridiculous, and swingy fifteen minutes.

Beasty Bar is a very good card game - if you like "in your face" kind of games...! I happen to do, at least when it's such a short game (i.e. that is why I haven't played Diplomacy or Lifeboats), but as all of the cards basically can screw your opponent over, it's easier to forgive your fellow players when they thwart your masterplan!

The game is packed with delightful decisions, and the overall gameplay and goal is very simple; it's the choice and interaction between the various animals on the cards that make the game very interesting! Basically the gameplay is "play a card, do what it says", and when 5 cards are on the table, the two furthest along get into the bar (= score points), while the last one is out of the game. Rinse and repeat until everybody has played 12 cards. Very simple! But, as said, what makes this game good are the many different abilities of the animals; and the abilities are actually even somewhat thematic, such as obviously the chameleon copying another creature, the lion being the strongest animal, the monkey getting a bonus when in large numbers, the kangaroo jumping in front of other players and the seal swapping the ends of the line... well, the last not is definitely not thematic, but it's a crucial card as it can really mess with the players! I love it, but also hate it sometimes as it can have a big impact on the scoring (as careless play can often lead to the player playing the seal getting two cards into the bar). Oh, and I also really like the recurring ability mechanics of some of the animals!

There is some seat order-binding, i.e. if there are 3 animals on the table and I play one which doesn't kill any of them, the next player has a very good opportunity to play the last animal which will probably head directly into the bar as that player can manipulate things. Therefore, I will often choose not to play the 4th animal, or if I do, I make sure it kills some of the others, so I myself end up placing the last animal. However, it's not absolutely necessary, but you do need to avoid always playing the second-to-last animal... There is a bit semi-cooperation and alliance making when playing the cards, and this is an interesting aspect of the game.

The game rarely takes more than 20 minutes, and it's great with both 3 and 4 (2 feels a little different and not as good, as the more the merrier due to the more chaos). All in all I very much recommend this game.

The first game I've played with an image of a skunk's butt in all its glory.  Thanks!

Solid filler, but it's let down by the ugly artwork, the size of the cards, and the unclear iconography.  You'll be referring to the cheat sheet constantly until you memorise the powers.  None of these are deal-breakers, but they do take the game down a notch.

 When Spielbox, the respected long-running German Board games magazine, asked its writers to list their Top 10 games from Essen 2014, of the 5 writers, 4 of them had this in their Top Three.   What was it about this apparently simple 15 minute card game that these gaming experts were getting excited about?  Having played it I can see exactly what makes it so compelling, though putting that into words is more of a challenge.  It is a bit like trying to explain why Love Letter is such a great game as the explanation makes it sound pedestrian.  

Briefly: identical card hands consisting of beautifully illustrated animals on large format cards are used to place on the table one by one in turn.  The animals form a line, you place your animal at the back of the line and you want your animals to be at the front of the line.  Each one has an ability:  the crocodile eats most animals in front of it, the hippo barges forward to the front, the kangaroo jumps over two animals, and so on.    

Beasty Bar is hugely entertaining to play and does so in 20 minutes.  Highly recommended.

I have not played it yet as a 3 player game, and I suspect that is the very best constellation for this game

The game plays a lot like Guillotine. You add animals to a line and trigger some special powers of different animals. The art is very nice and the game is pretty colorful.

I just wish that they would have used text instead of icons on the cards as they can be confusing. I'm constantly having to look up the card abilities in the rulebook. So since the games are so similar I'd always rather play Guillotine.

Very funny pictures on the cards.
From reading the rules it seemed that this could involve quite a bit of thinking with regard to which  card to play. However, at least with 4 players this is rather unpredictable. Of course you could try to remember which cards your oppponents have already played, however, then it'S not a "fun" game anymore

Ahhhh. okay.  It is exactly what it purports to be: a card playing game with card effects that can cause I wild amount of hilarity between players (see: chaos and unpredictable effects). I know there are players who like games where you can't predict what wild swings of fortune are going to happen, so you can laugh it up with your friends as this animal eats that animal, this one buds in line, this one who was in front now is in the back, etc., etc.  Beasty Bar works just fine as a game of this type, but that type of game is so not what I enjoy.  You have NO idea what cards are in your opponents' hands (unless you really want to card count for such a light game).  So you may get through to the front of the line or you may get totally fucked, based all on what your opponent's play, which is extremely opaque.  I guess you can try to recall if all your opponent's have played their lions, or monkeys, or whatever.  No point on really going on about this one... Plus, why the cards sooo huge? This could have been a standard card game you could pick up for $10.  Instead, it's twice the price because they had to print almost clown-sized cards for the game. Geez!

Opinion: funny filler game, with the size of the box you can carry it almost everywhere, and not many space needed to play. During the game you will have some fun, always depending on your group...should I play this animal and send those to the street or better this one and my options are greater.
In my opinion, do not play the game seriously, who wins is not the goal of the game

Not much game here...but then if we played it correctly, we might like it better.  Will have to give it another try.  We made the mistake of just pulling 1 card at a time from our draw pile, instead of a hand to choose from.  Still, this is too light for us to consider buying.

RATING: 7.5
A nice little chaotic filler, something like Guillotine turned inside out.

You play animal cards into a line outside a nightclub. Each animal has its own effect, which can rearrange the line or discard the opponent's (or your) animals. Any time you reach five animals in line, the bouncer lets in the front two and boots out the last. When all cards have been played, whoever got the most animals into the club wins.

Beasty Bar is hilarious with 3-4 players, but with two players there just isn't enough chaos to make it fun.

Similar game to the early Guillotine game. Here, animals are queuing to get into a bar, using their abilities to jostle to the front of the queue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
.A játék kezdetén mindenki megkapja a 12 lapból álló kártyacsomagját. A kártyáinkon az állatok különböző képességekkel rendelkeznek cél az, hogy minél több állatunkat bejutassuk a bárba. A sikátor és a bár kártyák között 5 kártya hely van. Mindig a soron lévő játékos a kezében tartott 4 lapkája közül letesz egyet az utolsó helyre és az állat képességeit megnézve megállapítjuk, hogy tud-e előremozogni vagy más cselekedetet hajt végre. Ha mind az 5 hely telítve van, akkor a sor elején álló két szerencsés állat bejut a bárba, az utolsónak csak a sikátor jut és kiesik. A győztes az akinek a legtöbb állata bejut a bárba, egyenlőség esetén az a játékos győz akinek az állatkártyáin lévő számok összege kevesebb. 
Az állatok képességei:
1.	Bűzös borz: Az asztalon lévő két legmagasabb értékű állatfajtát kidobja a sikátorba. 
2.	Papagáj: Kidob egy általa választott állatot.
3.	Kenguru: Átugorhat egy vagy két állatot. 
4.	Majom: Önmagában nincs hatása, ha viszont megérkezik egy másik majom, akkor a második majom a sor elejére ugrik az első majom pedig mögé érkezik.
5.	Kaméleon: Leutánozza egy sorban lévő állat képességét.
6.	Fóka: Megfordítja a lent lévő állatok sorrendjét.
7.	Zebra: Védve van a krokodiltól. Vízilovak és krokodilok nem tudnak keresztüljutni rajta (kivéve a kígyó képességének segítségével).
8.	Zsiráf: Átugorja a sorban előtte álló állatot, ha annak értéke kisebb, mint a zsiráfé. Ez ismétlődő képesség, azaz minden körben meg kell nézni, hogy az előtte álló állat értéke kisebb, mint a zsiráfé, ha igen, akkor átugorja. 
9.	Kígyó: Sorba rendezi az állatokat az értékük alapján: A legnagyobb értékű állat kerül a sor elejére, a legkisebb értékű a sor végére. 
10.	Krokodil: Megeszi az előtte álló, alacsonyabb értékű állatokat (kivéve, ha zebra védi őket). Ez minden körben érvényes, vagyis amíg az asztalon van megeszi az előtte lévő kisebb értékű állatokat. 
11.	Víziló: Megelőzi az előtte álló, alacsonyabb értékű állatokat (kivéve, ha zebra védi őket). Ez is ismétlődő hatás.
12.	Oroszlán: Az oroszlán minden állatot megelőz, és a sor elejére kerül, és minden majmot elkerget, azaz elküldi őket a sikátorba. Ha jönne még egy oroszlán, úgy az azonnal a sikátorba kerül. 
A játékot ezeknek a tulajdonságoknak minél jobb kihasználásával kell megnyerni. Mindig három állat közül választhatunk, de persze van, hogy nincs az adott helyzetnek megfelelő állat a kezünkben, akkor is le kell tennünk valamelyiket. Emiatt persze szerencse bőven van a játékban, de ez egy könnyed, hangulatos, családi játékba belefér. Két játékossal nem működik a játék. Túlságosan könnyű kiszámolni ki mit rakott le, túlságosan egyértelmű, hogy mi fog történni. 3 vagy 4 játékossal viszont szórakoztató, könnyed játék.

Initial rating: 5.0 (October 2016)

I haven’t had heard about Beasty Bar before playing it, but I enjoyed it although it’s not my cup of tea.

The rules of the game are easy to explain, however, as each card plays differently you can explain the game under 6 minutes. Playtime is less than 10 minutes.

The art of the game is very good as is the idea behind it. Cool theme but pasted on.

I generally dislike queue games like Guillotine, but this one is much better (because it plays very fast).

The decisions are easy but you have to think and anticipate your opponents, still, if you make a mistake it isn’t a big deal because the game plays so fast. For the same reason I don’t mind the chaos and randomness.

Bottom line, Beasty Bar is a silly and fun game, perfect for non-gamer’s or the family. It isn’t for me because it is way too light for my current tastes. I won’t buy it, but I will play again if requested.

Beasty Bar reminds me of Guillotine although I feel Beasty Bar has quite a bit more strategy.  I really like how each of the twelve animals has its own special power and how each one feels very different.  I also like that it's all in this nice little package of game that takes no longer than 20 minutes.  It's fun and strategic from start to end.

RATING: 5
Ended up in the Fairplay Top 10 for Spiel 2014 which only can be explained by the spatial arrangement with less than 20 metres between the two booths. The game itself is perfectly average. I didn’t enjoy the mix of a bad rules overhead/playing time ratio caused by 12 non-self explanatory action cards, player targeting, mostly random gameplay and a bit of card counting. Others had fun with it.

RATING: 6
Occupies a sort of awkward space where the game is a little too complex (and mean) for kids, but too random for adults. As long as kids are okay with seeing the majority of their animals kicked out of line, I think they would like it - the illustrations are not my favorite, but the kids got a laugh out of them. But I don't think I would play this with adults because the randomness factor can be a little frustrating. At least it's quick!

The animals are dressed up and ready to enter the "Beasty Bar" nightclub. Who will actually make it through the door?

Beasty Bar is a fun "take that" card game about party animals. The players play animal cards into a line, and each animal has a special power that can manipulate the order of the cards. Whenever five animals are present at the end of a turn, the two animals up front get to party while the one at the rear has to go home. Whoever manages to send more of her animals to the party than anyone else wins.

It reminds me of Guillotine with an extra layer and everyone have equivalent decks.  I wish the endgame with finish one round earlier b/c you really don't have a choice of what card to play (or you're making a double choice in the penultimate round).  Shortening it one round, I think, would improve this light game overall and not outlast it's welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
FIRST IMPRESSION:

This reminds me a bit of Guillotine in that you are placing cards in a line but instead of trying to cut off the heads of nobles, you are trying to get your animals into the party. In my first play, over 50 animals got shown the door and only 6 made it into the club/party. Each player has the same deck but only has three cards at a time in hand to play and each animal has a different instant or permanent ability. Art is fun and the cards are pleasantly large sized! I'd play again.

Sort of a cross between Guillotine and Savannah Cafe, this is a cute game with disturbing artwork about animals trying to get into a bar. As animals do. Despite the Euroglyphics it's not hard to remember each animal's special power, and it allows for some clever card play.

Nice that it's not a run of the mill theme. Unique and quirky but accessible to kids.

It had some surprising depth when playing with my usual group, but was able to scale to a different tone when the kids played. Yes, it can feel chaotic and random, but if it lacks in strategy, it tries to make up for it with tactics. It's a matter of waiting for opportunities. Everyone has the same twelve cards, so during the game, if you pay attention you can narrow down the possibilities and make plays that have better potential for your chances.

The oversize cards are great.

Found out about this game after watching Zee Garcia's review on the Dice Tower. 

On nights we want to play a bunch of games that don't last too long, this will be one that hits the table for sure. It will likely also be a filler I go to on regular game nights, and when playing games with the kids.

RATING: 7
I've played this a few times now with 2, 3 and 4. 3 players can get the players caught in a pattern because 3 cards will be played every turn once the game gets going and being the final player to play a card is a big advantage. 

Play is quite chaotic but wouldn't say it's random. I don't win often but better players seem to be able to win consistently. Great game - I recommend it!

A fun filler to close an evening. In your turn you play one of your animal cards and place them in line for a place in the bar. Then the special effects of the card will be executed: jumping the line, eating your way forward if you are a crocodile, chasing one type of animals out if it's a skunk etc. So nice chaos. When you place the fifth inline, the first two will enter the bar. Fun game and smart play is definitely possible.

"Beasty Bar" ist der angesagteste Club der Stadt und alle hippen Tiere wollen dort natürlich rein. Dumm nur, dass es einen grummeligen Gorilla-Türsteher und eine sehr lange Warteschlange gibt. Doch vielleichtkommt man mit einem Trick doch noch in den Club?! Die Spieler legen abwechselnd Tierkarten in eine Reihe und simulieren so die Warteschlange. Sind 5 Tiere in der Schlange, dürfen die vordersten zwei Tiere in den Club - das bringt Siegpunkte. Doch jedes gespielte Tier hat noch einen Einzigartigen effekt. Das Krokodil frisst kleinere Tiere (mit kleinerem Zahlenwert), vor ihm in der Schlange auf. Das Känguru überspringt einfach mal zwei Positionen. Das Stinktier ekelt andere Tiere aus der Schlange und die Robbe verdreht direkt die ganze Warteschlange. Als Spieler muss man immer genau überlegen, wann man welches Tier spielt und welchen Effekt dies auf die Warteschlange hat. Ein Spiel mit verrückten Regeln und witzigem Artwork, für Zwischendurch!

A card line manipulation game, similar to (but better than) Guillotine. Players play cards to a row that, once filled up, scores the first two cards in the row. Each card has a special power, and watching these interact forms the meat of the game. 10 minutes of explanation seems a bit much for 20 minutes of fun, but it seems like a game that will grow with repeated plays. Furthermore, there's an expansion (Beasty Bar: New Beasts in Town) that promises to extend things further.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]At some point I'll stop buying micro games since they have such a short shelf life in our house. The decisions made in this game were fun at first but there isn't really much too so the game so it got stale quickly. I prefer quick, simple games that develop a meta game like Cockroach Poker, Beasty Bar didn't offer that at all so it ended up leaving our collection.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Top notch production, the card quality is outstanding and the cards are tarot sized [i](like Lost Cities)[/i].
- Excellent family/gateway filler game. It is easy to teach/learn and plays well at all player counts.
- Awesome artwork and theme for this style of game, my kids love it.
- There is a lot of depth to be found in the game; the way each animal reacts towards each different animal makes each game a unique experience. 
- Beasty Bar does a great job presenting a take that style game in a family friendly package, it is a must have filler game![/i]

If you're the one to place the last card in the row, you have a lot more influence than the player to place the first card. With 4 players, it often happens that it's always the same player to place the last card, which is unbalancing.

This is great little game, where you are manipulating a line of cards - representing animals - to have your own at the top at the right time. Reminds me of Guillotine, but more tight and (slightly) less silly.  A huge hit with the kids at home.

A cute variation on the ‘queue game’ (think Guillotine or Family Business), themed around animals trying to get into a nightclub. Each of the 12 animals has a special effect, which you use to jostle ahead in the line and evict your rivals. It’s almost entirely tactical but a lot of fun, aided by the luridly amusing artwork.

A nice puzzle-like filler with a little memory thrown into a mild "take that" filler game.  The game plsy is simple and streamlined but each turn is almost a little puzzle as you try to figure out how in the world you are going to get your beast in the bar and also not set up your opponents to do the same.  Just a  clever filler with great art to boot.

RATING: 6.9
Neat filler or starter game in which a bunch of animals use their special abilities to get into a popular club. I like the variant where players are building their own "decks" by choosing some of the animals. Mostly everyone is selecting different cards than the others. Playing is fun and quick. But I doubt if you want to play more than three times in a row. Maybe together with the expansion.

If you've played Guillotine, Beasty Bar is a dramatically improved version that's a lot more fun.  Yes, it's silly and very random, but you're not really playing this so much to win as to see the chaos unfold.  This has been a hit with everyone I've introduced it to and a great way to end a game night.

Played once with 4P. A filler card game with a dubiously amusing theme of animals jostling their way to get into a bar – why some animals are wearing clothes and others aren't, I'll never know. 

Anyway, each animal has a unique power which helps it sneak its way to the front of the line. These powers are mostly thematic; monkeys gang up to move to the front, the skunk repels other animals, and so on. The gameplay is confrontational, yet players often have to begrudgingly assist opponents in getting animals into the bar.

The special powers make clever tactical moves possible, although serious gamers could turn this into a card-counting nightmare. Playing this with the advanced scoring rules makes more sense, as animals are scored depending on the relative strength of their powers. It's a decent card filler, although its rather lengthy rules – given its short playing time – is a bit of a downer.

YAY!  i love this cute little game.  

you must line up your animal cards so that they can get into the hot new nightclub.

i think the iconography could be improved.... a few of the animal affects aren't clear and clarifying movement slows this game down.

RATING: 6
This is a cute little filler along the lines of [thing=116]Guillotine[/thing]: there's a line of cards where periodically the ones up front score, and the cards do various manipulations. The twist here is that each player has an identical deck of cards (with nice illustrations and great, clear, icons) which they shuffle and draw over the course of the game. There is a little control, but it's mostly a light, random, chaotic little card game. Or at least it felt that way, since I did so poorly!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player shuffles their deck of cards and draws a hand of 4 (or 5?) cards. On your turn, play a card to the back of the line and apply its effect. Then, any cards already in line activate their ongoing effects (if any). Cards have a variety of effects like rearranging the line, flipping front/back, discarding other cards, etc. If the line has 5 cards, the first 2 get into Beasty Bar and the last one is removed from the game. The game then continues, until it is no longer possible to have a full line.

At the end, score the cards that made it into the Bar. Basic scoring is just to count the number of cards of each player, but other variants score different points depending on the card scored. Most animals/points wins!

There are also other variants where you start with random cards removed, or with a customized deck.

RATING: 4
Each player has a set of identical animal cards which they play into a queue. Everyone is desperate to get into the nightclub; when the queue reaches five, two get in and one is booted from the back of the queue into the alley. Different cards have different numbers and different effects: the crocodile eats all animals in front of it values < 10; the kangaroo jumps 1-2 spaces in front; the snake rearranges the queue into numeric order.

It works OK as a highly tactical take that filler, but the language-neutral components are inscrutable until explained, so it's tough to pick up and play (versus something like Guillotine); that matters in a casual game like this. I don't think it works for experienced players because the luck of the draw dominates. Worst of all are the vulgar and unattractive illustrations.

Jópofa, vicces, gyors. Másikkal kiszúrós, de olyan gyorsan pörög a játék, hogy, mire megharagudnál, már két körrel és további 2-3 kiszúrással odább vagyunk:)
Azonos kártyakészlettel indulunk, amiből mindig húzunk a kezünkbe újabb lapokat. Ezeket játsszuk ki. Ha betelt az asztalon az 5 férőhely, a két elől lévő lapot bejuttatjuk a győzelmi pontot hozó bárba, az utolsót pedig kidobjuk.
Kicsit a Guillotine-re hasonlít, csak van egy értelmes mechanika is a külcsín mögött. Ajánlott filler.

Like chaotic but fun card games like [thing=153]Take 5[/thing]? Then check out Beasty Bar. It's similar but with cuter animal artwork. Each animal has a certain special ability that screws up the order of the cards and hopefully leads to you scoring cards. But that's hard as the situation changes quite dramatically with each card played.
It is very chaotic, but also quite enjoyable. Only: Take 5 is a better game.

Is this entirely chaotic, or can you actually start to plan if you card count (even if you only count your own)? Either way, it was an enjoyable 20 minutes and is another really well made Zoch game, even if it is prone to some horrific king-making opportunities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is ok, good art, clever mechanics, but it doesn't work so well and it less entertaining than I thought it would be. Having only 4 cards in your hard makes it quite random and often you will waste a good animal, hoping the others will be more useful in the future.  Besides, even if it's a card games, new players will have some problems remembering all the powers, despite in my opinion the card iconography is quite good, so in that cases it will play mush slower of what if should be.

A very simple pick-a-card, play-a-card game where players have identical numbered decks and card powers rather than the numbers are the main attraction.

I really like this game. It has a very clever mechanism. On your turn you play an animal which has a certain effect to the "animal queue" in front of the club. As soon as 5 animals are in the row, some may enter and the furthest behind gets kicked out. I like how you can never be completely secure that you bring your "points" in the club.
Clear recommendation for a filler and if you are not too obsessed with winning a game because you can never have a clear strategy here :)

Beasty Bar came recommended from the folks over at Fortress Ameritrash as a nice little filler with some take-that action in it and I can say it delivers.

The basic premise if you have animals and you want to get them into a nightclub. Each animal will manipulate the line in their own way. Once there are five animals, the two in front get in and the one all the way at the end gets kicked out. You’ll end up playing all twelve of your cards, though the last few cards may not matter.

This game reminds me quite a bit of Guillotine in that it’s about manipulating a line of cards. However, you’re creating the line, and the cards used to create the line also manipulate it (instead of cards that only manipulate the line). I think it’s a bit better than Guillotine and would probably bring this out more often.

If I have any cons is that you probably shouldn’t play this game with people who are easily offended by someone taking an action that hurts your position. I also feel like there’s a good bit of luck here depending on the cards that you draw and your position, but you should be able to mitigate this luck.

Something about the theme really appealed so I really wanted to try this but when it comes down to it I felt the gameplay to be rather boring and in the end when there were fewer options of cards it just felt rather random I don't mind random but there has to be more depth for me. Not terrible but there are many other filler card games out there that I would choose over this. The artwork is lovely though but just not enough.

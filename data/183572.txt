Containing the one card that still haunts the meta today: Half-Elf Bard. A great starter with fantastic BAC's. An excellent addition to my DM repertoire.

More good stuff, and one can definitely argue that the D&D Dice Masters are the best of the bunch, but I do wish they were diversify the graphics a little more, also the titles. 'Battle for Faerun', 'Faerun Under Siege', and the artwork on both sets so far looks too samey. There's a lot more to D&D than just this, and I hope they get a chance to integrate other moods into the game.

   Faerun Under Seige takes Dice Masters one step closer to that role-playing experience with the addition of new races, classes, and equipment.

Note to self:

Please, no more of this crap. Talk about being tired of Egyptian themes, or   mediterranean trading games that you hear some people ranting about, some reviewers, they never get enough of the same old crap like this I guess and ignore the money pit of this franchise. 

Guess if you are a reviewer, you get free demos, money for what it is is no object?

Oh, the repetitive dice rolling, the poorly, small in print, cobbled together rule books, the not updated cheesy play mat when they changed game play, the next to useless dice bags. 

I rather play Yahtzee in its many versions.

Dicenstein looks like a better dice collection set game with a fixed MSRP for the whole game in a box. At least with it it will have some resell value, I have found Dice Master has none once the masses have spent $200 to get a full set of cards and dice.

I like this better than Quarriors, more complex choices available during your turn due to the global abilities and option to hold back characters for defense.  Dice in a bag are easier for my youngest daughter to randomize compared to shuffling Magic The Gathering cards.

The dice quality is much improved from the first DM set I bought (Avengers) and the dice bags provided now have artwork, but they are still naff bags - get your own from Artscow.

There are some nice cards and the gameplay is still very good - and the rule book has been improved a bit..yay!

However, Wizkidz has further gone down in my estimation by extending the number of Super-Rares in the set. The collectable model already sucked big-time but this is naked profiteering. I never felt the need to complete a set anyway and always ignored or sold the super-rares, but this kind of contempt for their customers is crass, gross consumerist leeching at it's worst - whichever accountant nonce came up with the idea deserves to die alone.

As a game it's worth an 8 but add in the collectible aspect and it goes down to a 4 - it would be lower but as long as you only want to play casually you can ignore the collectable aspect, but it still sticks in my throat and suggests a p!$$-poor company.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

I'd rather play [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123607/puzzle-strike-third-edition]Puzzle Strike[/url]

I like this version of Dice Masters. Of course, the stupid price of singles makes it annoying to get a full set (59,99 for a single card?? count me out). But aside from the money grab and collectible BS, this game is great. The starter is enough to have great fun, and the few boosters I got gave me some nice combos. If you liked Quarriors, and skipped Battle for Faerun and any other Dice Masters, get this one. I really wish the dice colors wouldn't be so ugly though (pepto bismol pink plus used gum green is not interesting).

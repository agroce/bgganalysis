Another great tabletop-miniature-game.
Unique mechanics(though turnbased, you can react to your opponents actions with limited actions yourself, for example), one of the best balanced games I've encountered but steep learning curve and, when playing with experienced people, unfogiving to tactical errors.
Great models, too.

Best heroic scale miniatures and the best sci-fi shooter themed tabletop wargame out there.  Skirmish scale is easy to get in to.  Horrible rulebook, look for fan-made ones online.  Would play it more but had to purge it along with other minis games due to time/money.

Este juego tiene unas miniaturas espectaculares. El sistema de juego es rápido y bastante letal lo que hace que las partidas sean siempre intensas y emocionantes. Inicialmente no necesitas invertir mucho dinero para hacerte con un pequeño grupo de combate y empezar a jugar. Peeeero... eso no quita que, para tener un ejercito competitivo, debas acabar invirtiendo una fortuna en miniaturas.

Además de las miniaturas este juego requiere de mucha escenografía (edificios, barricadas, obstáculos...) y se juega en una mesa de 1,20m x 1,20m que hay que rellenar. Si no quieres utilizar cajas de zapatos y botellas de cocacola necesitaras invertir también en escenografía (lo que no es nada barato). Afortunadamente siempre es posible reutilizar las mesas de otros juegos de estrategia, unirte a clubs que ya tengan escenografía o acudir a tiendas con mesas ya preparadas.

Pros: El juego es intenso y las partidas son muy divertidas. Las miniaturas son impresionantes y hay muchísimas para elegir. Los modos de juego son variados ya que existen infinidad de escenarios para jugar (incluso existe una campaña completa). Las reglas las puedes descargar gratis desde la propia página del juego.

Contras: Las reglas son complejas ya que existen muchas  habilidades especiales, armamento y equipamiento que debes conocer para aprovechar al máximo tus tropas o evitar ser sorprendido por los enemigos. Resulta un juego caro si quieres aprovecharlo al máximo.

NOTAS 3º EDICION: Versión muy mejorada. Todas las reglas han sido escritas con gran atención al detalle para que sean fáciles de comprender. Los cambios introducidos por la nueva edición convierten un, ya de por sí, gran juego en un juegazo increible!.

Miniature game where miniatures are abstracted by silhouette templates :( 

Poor handling of LoS & Cover. The rules are badly written, often overly complex and handle d20 poorly.
Really fiddly with 10-20 minis. Spam lists break the alternate turn mechanic. Many units are included only to give action points and end-up never being used.

Fun when playing with low miniature count, the miniatures look fantastic; unfortunately this overshadows some serious issues with the rules and gameplay.

I love how cinematic this game is...  It definitely has a little bit of an RPG feel to it...  Takes a bit of time to get the rules down--but very fun to come up with your own missions and scenarios.

Addendum...  I think the ruleset is getting a bit bloated.  Still enjoying this with a casual set of opponents, but avoiding rule lawyers...

Addendum #2...  Anxiously awaiting 3rd ed.

Addendum #3...  May be getting too rule heavy.  I don't enjoy playing against spam lists...

Very good nearly flawless rules, nearly perfectly balanced, very good miniature design(IMHO, although you should like MasamuneShirow aka Appleseed/GhostIntheShell style minis).

Amazing skirmish game! And an amazing miniatures game in general. I always have loads of fun playing this game. The rules are detailed yet fast, the decisions are many and varied and the miniatures are just stunning! Really can't recommend this enough.

Some people mention the somewhat high price of the minis, but remember tha tyou don't need all that many to begin with. So the overall price of playing Infinity versus a lot of other miniature games is actually lower.

A fast-playing flavor-heavy sci-fi skirmish game with incredible miniatures quality.  The third edition of the game has brought much needed tweaks and clarifications that propel Infinity past any other miniatures game, or any wargame, that I've ever played.  Infinity has made me rethink the way that I view space and time, which is nothing short of amazing.  The models are also a particular joy to paint thanks to their unmatched detail, especially the new models designed with digital sculpting.

Free minimalist [u]table-top[/u] skirmish SF miniature wargame. Very elegant system allowing positional and tactical playing. It has a very nice reaction system that keeps both players active every turn.
I use miniatures (and rulers) from Warhammer 40k (some Space Marines and Orks) which are cheaper, some paper boxes as terrain and some d20 dice.
The manual is free but nice games can be played using 4 miniatures by each side and the Quick Start Rules. I use the 2nd edition rules.

A miniatures game largely defined by HOW you play, not so much your force selection. Composition is important, but not nearly so inherently devastating and facing your guys the wrong way. Everything is deadly. 

I don't agree with some of the changes in N3. +6 to shotguns at close range, with an 8-16 band of +0 and a -3 out to 24? Boarding shotguns are a point cheaper than combi rifles, cover whole areas in death, are no longer "stopped" by the target winning a FtF roll, and worst of all, ignore cover bonuses if they hit. The lower burst doesn't even matter. These weapons are stupid, stupid, stupid. Impact templates as a whole aren't bad, but shotguns specifically are ridiculous.

The minis really attracted me to this one. Anime themed futuristic robots? Yes, please. The rules look unique, and some-what innovative for a minis game, and the sculpts are just plain dyno-mite! Caveat: The minis are not for beginners...at all. I've assembled and painted minis for 30 years, and the only line that is worse for assembly than Infinity is Relic Knights metals. be warned. 

The mechanics in this game are innovative and very unique. The fact that it uses d20's instead of d6's in an interesting change. The number of special rules, and sheer number of actions possible in a turn keeps you referring back to the rulebook every turn. It could be my inexperience with the game, but I still would enjoy this more if the rules were a bit more streamlined, or the designers had included some sort of reference sheet for the rules, and special abilities, and weapons.

That said, it's a really interesting game with fantastic minis, it just needs some reference sheets to speed gameplay for those new to the thing.

A Problem is all those special rules, but you can get over this.

With more play it ocures to me that the Dice Mechanic is not really good. Because of D20 and the F2F Rolls you can´t really guess or calculate the odds of success. 
Will try out to play it with 3D6 insted of D20 to make it less random and cut off extrem rolls

Very solid sci-fi miniatures rules.  I like the ARO system that lets models react when they spot something happening.  The hacking and drone rules are also pretty cool.  Infinity loses a point for rules bloat, as there are too many similar skills, and skills that include other skills nested inside them.  A solid clean-up of the rules would be great, but since 3rd edition just dropped, unlikely.  Still, it's a great game overall.

Infinity is a 28mm scale skirmish Miniatures Game. 

The game has become one of the major forces on the market, not as strong as Warmachine/Hordes, but a recognizable force alright, with a rapidly growing fanbase. 

Infinity's scenario is placed into a post-cyberpnk future where Humanity has managed to make its first foray into the stars and created new colonies and cultures in the progress, even coming into contact with two alien races. 

The game is centered around platoons from around (10-20 minatures each side) of the respective human or alien factions who are sent out to perform black op missions against each other. 

The game system is based on D20 rolls, resource-management (in the form of order generation and order distribution) and the very innovative ARO-procedure. 

Every model generates one order being placed into a pool the whole platoon can take orders from to activate one model at a time on the active players turn. 
With this activation the order can be used for any one or two actions physically possible. It is even possible to activate a model consecutively up until all orders from the pool are spend. 
If any model comes in line of sight of an opposing model, the opposing model can react immediately against the former it.  

This mechanism helps to keep both players engaged and directs the focus of the battle. Thus it creates very cinematic scenes with lots of heroism, action and drama. 

The miniatures themselves are made from white metal, true scale, and are detailwise one of the best ranges on the market for default miniatures games. They always come unpainted and have to  be assembled.

While the general rules are relatively easy to understand the main difficulty comes with the huge catalogue of special rules for both the miniatures skills, states and equipment, which often sound similar but are in fact different. 

Also, while getting into the game has become amazingly cheap (compared to the time before 2014) due the releases of Corvus Bellis Carboard terrain packs (4x of these for 10 € each, are enough for a full table), the dependancy on lots of terrain for a good gaming experience raises the costs to the general level one is used to for a miniatures game.  

Infinity is an intriguing, well balanced, visually stunning game which provides the players with lots of immersion, action, drama and mayhem. 
It relives its inspirations like Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed, Alien, the Matrix (and many more) superbly once the players jump full throttle into its ruels system and get creative with both painting the miniatures and collecting thematically fitting terrain. 

Yet a casual game it is not. But then again this shouldn't come as a surprise. ;)

Played it quite a bit, don't like it very much.  It gets credit for having unique mechanics, but that's about as far as my enjoyment goes.  The game play is mostly about creating favorable match ups, hoping you aren't screwed by the dice delivering an inopportune crit from the defender, rinsing and repeating.

Played it twice with the N2 rules, got the N3 book but I still gotta play those. Anyhoo, it's superb. I painted quite some miniatures already, got a heap of haqqislam to finish. I haven't played wargames that much, but this played much more intuitively than lotr sbg and also the customization of your army is a lot clearer at first sight, than WH40K (didn't play it yet) where the meta obviously matters on what you want to take. Infinity promised and delivered a ruleset and model stats that make every model matter. Great game, great company.

Excellent skirmish/squad level game. There aren't too many really good squad level skirmish games available. Most of them "bloat" into a company/battalion level game (i.e. Warhammer 40K, Warmachine/Hordes, Bolt Action, etc). Hopefully, if that does happen to this game, the company will still print skirmish/squad level rules for this game system.

The X-Com of miniature games.

I love the game but it has some drawbacks to new players, especially terrain requirements including the experience necessary for good placement. Inexperienced players can also be turned off by the dirty tricks of the game until they figure out how to deal with them and begin using some of their own. After learning the game and its tactics, you are completely rewarded with a fun, fast and balanced game. This miniature game really rewards in-game skill more than list composition or faction selection.

The cost of entry is low, but cost per model is more than other non-GW games. The miniatures however are across the board stunning and all-metal. Collecting a faction's full range is comparable to a GW army in price and can be used to create several different lists and variations.

Incredible game for painters, scenery builders and those who want a great sci-fi skirmish game.

I cannot count the number of miniature games I've played since I first tried Warhammer Fantasy over 20 years ago. This one trumps them all if you are looking for a tactical experience. The game's steep learning curve rewards anyone that pushes through with an amazing competition of tough decisions and a battle of wits. 

The sheer number of different troops types here is stunning, but unlike other mini games with a large variety of troops options the variety here is in combinations of abilities and weapons, not unique ways to break the rules. For me this is huge, as the alternative results in frustration if you are not intimately familiar with everything your opponent brings to the table. Those types of games are majorly based on creating a better list before the game starts. 

Infinity has a relatively small number of abilities and weapon options, but the combinations that these are available in as well as synergies with other models in your force is where this strength is found. Additionally it is the way you perform on the game table that determines the winner, and even the cheapest unit can be deadly if played well. A big reason for this is the d20 system, which some people will call out as a fault in the game. No matter how powerful your selected unit may be, if you play carelessly or recklessly you may get punished, HARD. 

Utilizing your troops in coordination and taking advantage of the terrain is where most games will be won or lost, and it's a very satisfying experience either way.

I needed a few more plays to finally get this game. The reaction mechanics really make this game worth playing in the abundant fields of skirmish miniature games. Definitely worth a check!

Probably the best SF tactical skirmish game on the market, with the most magnificent miniatures range of any game, anywhere.

One of the best rulesets to represent modern firefights in tabletop games that I have come across. Bit too anime/hi tech for my tastes, but reaction based system sure makes walking around without cover is going to get you killed. Needs lots of terrain though, so quite a lot work to setup a game, although you don't need that many miniatures.

One of the best wargames I've ever played. It's a bit hard to get into, so I'd advice people to go to the forums and contact the community when they start out. Not a low entry for a wargame, unfortunately. But worth the effort! ;) 

Plays like a FPS and feels very, very cinematic.

The most fiddly game I ever was forced to dabble into. Very unpleasant experience. Some people seem to mistake fiddlyness for complexity or depth. Not me.
Very unpleasant game.

RATING: 5
Almost as good as Rezolution, but for some kind of reason (possible they wanted to stay apart from most of the other miniature wargames)  the designers chose to use a d20 and a strange system for citical hits, you allways calculate to track down the critical number allthough it couls have been 20 or 1.

RATING: 6
Coolest new sci fi fluff around I'd say. Humanity on the brink of a new state of being (AI's, emergent global consciousness, 24/7 personal connection to the web etc.).

Miniatures are some of the best on the market too, except for a few sculptural mishaps. Corvus Belli should focus on making vehicles and getting the existing ranges of soldiers done, instead of constantly expanding with new types of infantry.

The game has some nice concepts, but is really not as good as the hype make it out to be. Maybe it's because of the translation to english, but a lot of concepts and definitions are counter intuitive and gamey.

The designers promote the system's 'reaction orders' as a break from classic IGO-UGO mechanics, but re-actions are not a new concept - not in miniatures gaming either. The rules still heavily favors the attacker, which makes it too easy to jump around a corner and take out two-three defenders. 

The order system is in no way related to command skills but is merely based on how many miniatures you have in your force (more men = more orders). Ths is again counter intuitive as a smaller force should be easier to command.

Just got a Nomads army including Zond Remotes, The Szalamandra and the book. I'm looking forward to trying this out. Definately looks cool :O) My initial impression is that this is a very cool and tactical sci-fi tabletop game!

A great tabletop miniatures game. Only recommended if you're into this sort of thing and enjoy the hobby aspect. But if you do, there's some pretty darn good gaming here.

Apparently the designers were heavily inspired by Warzone, both rules and background are very similar. Compared to Warzone it has its advantages and disadvantages. The "wait/reaction"-mechanic is better here, but the d20-system doesnt work well with so few miniatures.

Minis are nice, rules are subpar.

Downloaded full and quick start rules (and later bought 1st and 2nd edition rulebooks). I like the reaction system and will soon probably give them a try. The miniatures are great!

Update after first test: the rules worked well and the ARO system kept the game lively even playing solo. Game approved!

Well, I said I wouldn't get into any more miniature wargames, but this one looks pretty awesome; like Earth Reborn and Warhammer on steroids.

I actually bought the rulebook but that's because I love collecting rulebooks. I don't think I'll buy any models in the future but you never know, might need the practice.

Sci-fi manga inspired miniatures combat system.  Great mini sculpts of cool factions with interesting attacks and weakness.  Game system has a dynamic aspect that speeds play and overall brings engaging tactics and combat.  In my unqualified opinion this is the sci-fi miniature ground combat game of choice if you dig miniature painting, moving dudes with rulers, and memorizing engagement rules and head-to-head unit advantages and weaknesses.  Unfortunately, I have no talent For gluing and painting, no patience for moving units with rulers, and rule details challenged. :)

This game is the stuff.  Along with Warhammer 40k these have been my gateway into the miniatures hobby.

Pain in the neck to put together w/panoceania antennae.

Really hard to find matches.  Am still on N2 rules, way behind w/N3 released months ago

Cool fluff and nice minis.
Be warned though that to get the fluff you'll have to pay for the physical rulebook which is one of the most expensive skirmish game rulebook on the market (along with Anima Tactics).
Minis are nice but are a true pain to assemble due to a strange conception. It's the first time I see less than 2mm long forearms as separate pieces...
They are also among the most expensive miniatures in the skirmish game category.
The ruleset seems easy to learn at first... At least the basic mechanics. But favors the experienced player. There are a lot of special rules, gadgets, weapons, abilities (and sometimes several level of the same ability). This triggers some exceptionnal situations that are not always intuitive to solve.
This and the lethality of combats will give a hard time to newbies, till they master this mass of information. Progressive introduction by playing smaller than standard games and as few gadgets as possible is mandatory.
The "Always your turn" ARO, system is original BUT, contrary to Corvus Belli's and fanboys' claims, not so innovative : action/reaction systems do exist in the miniature gaming sphere and alternate miniature activation too.
I might be interested again in this game in the future if they seriously trim down and clarify their rules. A better conception of the models to facilitate assembly would be a real incentive too...

My copy finally arrived. The rulebook is gorgeous and the sample miniatures I got were well detailed with minimal mold lines.

This one looks like a winner. Finding players might be problematic though.


Just have the rulebook, so not filing under 'owned' yet.

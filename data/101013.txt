RATING: 9
Pretty great game. I've found it works really well two player and also 4 player team is really fun. Turned into a vicious competitive match with a team playing both guards and strategizing on traps etc. and the other team being both Ninja and Traitor. We did perhaps sort of cheat in that Ninja and Traitor knew where each other were...

Its a TEN being the ninja. About a 5 not being the ninja. Easily solved by playing two games. 

I admit I haven't not been the ninja very often. Perhaps more plays will convince me otherwise. 

Needless to say being the ninja is some of the best boardgaming you will ever do. Its just damn cool sneaking around and killing stuff. Love this game. Highly recommend it.

Played a demo at the AEG booth at GenCon.  We managed to finish a full game and promptly bought a copy for our game group. This game captures the Ninja flavor incredibly well.  And I'm only NOT giving it a 10 yet because I've only played it once.  Honestly I don't see my rating going down; only up.  Fantastic game.

I like it!  It's a pretty well put together hidden movement game.  Both sides play very different, and it's a totally new game from either perspective.

Playing the intruders is a lot of reponsibility because you have to track your cards, positions and tell guards when they hear something.  It's like being a DM, sort of.

Playing the guards is mostly resource management and tactical thinking.  They have limited cards, so they have to manage their hands and draw deck.

Based on one play as the guards.

I really wanted to like this game. But it was flat. Such a pity because the theme is so awesome and fitting for the game mechanics.

For a cat-and-mouse game, Whitechapel is unsurpassed. Then I would reach for Garibaldi or Scotland Yard.

But Ninja just lacked tension. And the map seems so limiting. 

Luck seems to play a significant part for both sides. It's just random luck to find your letter in one of 2 buildings.

I will give this a second chance playing the ninja/traitor.

But realistically, I don't see myself reaching for this, when Whitechapel is so much more compelling.

2 Things that Bug: the rule book is very poorly written. I had to read it 5 times and still had to post questions to clarify some aspects. Secondly, the ninja + traitor figures' colours are reversed compared to player screen + card deck colours. That is a serious production error.

Excellent hidden movement game whose pay-off is the collective cleverness of the group that is interacting with the mechanics.  You have two intruders sneaking into a walled cluster of two castles while one player controls the guards that move according to pre-programmed patrol routes and/or cards played from the Guard player's hand.  Meanwhile, the Ninja and Traitor move freely across the map using a sheet of paper, only revealing their location when crossing a Guard's path.

The cat and mouse game of detection followed by the chase and swarming of guards is fantastic.  The inclusion of cards playable by both sides to modify events and manipulate the situation really adds a great deal of depth.  I especially enjoy the choice of your available cards from a pool, as opposed to it being built randomly.  If you want to be a bit reckless and rely on slaughtering any guard that gets in your way you can do that by taking all of the Kenjutsu and Shuriken cards.  Or you can take multiple Rope and Shadow Walk cards to deftly maneuver around your opponent.

The asymmetrical nature of the two sides is interesting as well and should keep replayability high.  Seems to play very well 2 or 3 players and I greatly enjoyed this.

Played this in Essen 2011, but it didn't work out for me. Hidden Movement/Detection did not seem balanced - more like a broken down version of Scotland Yard.

Disappointed.

Very good deduction game; theme is well intertwined: you really feel yourself intruder or guard; hidden movement and necessity to be alert during the whole game offers a pleasant tension for both sides; setup time and playing time are o.k. to me; this is the kind of game I like to play again immediately after finishing; I do not understand the large dose of criticism regarding this game.

RATING: 5.75
Ninja had some fun moments, but it was a lot of waiting for something interesting to happen.  Then, towards the end, the shortage of cards on each side made things even more stagnant.  The lack of action means lack of strategy to some extent, which really limited the fun.
Maybe it would improve with more plays, but I don't think I have it in me to try.

Should be more fun than it is.  Restrictive movement, very few offensive cards and low hit points means there are a lot of do nothing turns and impossible situations.  The goals are very swingy too.  Lots of flailing around in the dark.  It's pretty cool to sneak around and throw shuriken at guards though.  Maybe I'm missing the point and a very cautious strategy is best.   I never did well at stealth video games either because I always just wanted to fight the guards.  I think I need one more play to decide fully on this one.

Great thematic game, but I falls with Wonky game mechanics that make a draw game more frequent and every game through. That is a very bad thing, and makes the game lose replay-ability in the future, and that is why I feel it accumulating dust in my shelf since I purchase it.
Try it... but if you like it.

Read the rules, and they scared me off.  I like that the game seems to be optimized for two players, but wish the mechanisms were more streamlined.  Hide-and-seek games need to be streamlined, so that the players can focus on the fun of hidden movement!  I am looking for something that runs smoother than Nuns on the Run (which I think might be my favorite contender for best midweight hide-and-seek game at the moment)!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A pseudo-sequel to Nuns On The Run.  Ninja shares the same idea that you are trying to sneak in to the castle(s), find the proper hidden location, and then get away.   There are a lot of guards, and there is little that can be done quickly by the ninjas without giving yourself away, or practically away.   The board is big, and so are the screens and pads, which unfortunately makes it pretty easy to see where people are looking and/or writing.   The spaces, walls, and paths could have been more clearly represented as well.   I guess I prefer the pureness of Scotland Yard, but really for a game in this vein, I'd just rather play Mr. Jack.

The rules are very obtuse. I think that hidden information/deduction games need to be much more streamlined than this is. A player's options can be very limited by card draw, which adds too much frustration on your turn. Once you get beyond that, the gameplay is just very flat.

RATING: 6
This is a bit of an upgrade fro mthe old Scotland Yard game. The theme and art are both great and the rules are simple enough to play quickly. The game is a hidden movement game, and it does not track as easy as Scotland Yard (but more balanced), since revieling the path is not an option because of ropes and there are just to many guards to verify each of their movements. So, as long as you can trust your opponents, it is just fine. On that point, there are two people working together on both sides, so game theory would suggest they won't both lie to you. 

The game has deep levels of misdirection, an a lot of ways to use and abuse information gathering. There are plenty of ways to use information and provide misinformation. The guards alert level is a cool idea, that helps level out the playfield. 

I would suggest as the intruders, you need to allow the guards to expend their resources as much as you can before you try to make a serious push on the inner castles.

I have played a friend copy of this and overall I think its a little on the expensive side for what is essentially a mediocre 2-3 player game.

A lot of the minis (although beautifully moulded) are superfluous.
The cards for the traitor especially are a bit of a disappointment as they tend to pinpoint your location.

Gameplay is not overly complicated but is quite luck based i.e. how quickly you find you objective, (one game lasted 6 turns as the ninja ran in, discovered his objective on his first search, and then ran like hell). 

I do however really like the map sheets as they are very clear on which bits are walls/moats/spaces. The board itself tend to be a little busy (with artwork) and so the maps help make it clear.

I enjoyed the plotted/hidden movement.  I played the traitor and my friend was the ninja.  I haven't had a chance to play the guards yet.  

As the ninja/traitor, you're trying to find objectives within the castles while avoiding detection.  The guard gets clues about your location when you search, and through various card plays.  

If you like games like Scotland Yard, or maybe even Fury of Dracula you might like this one.  

The board art is great, and the minis are nice and thematic.  I especially liked that my traitor samurai had a cat on his sculpt.  This reflects one of his powers of "It was only a Cat" that he can play to avoid detection.  The drunken guards minis were a nice touch.  It would have been simple to only lay the guard figure down.  Nice touch AEG.  

I assume expansions could be simple to release either with new characters + their decks, and new boards.  Overall, I think new boards will do much to extend replay.

Not a bad game, quite thematic, but it's too easy to make mistakes and mess things up, with no way for the other players to find out. The somewhat confusing map doesn't help. Excellent production, with beautiful art and miniatures, but the gameplay would fit better on a computer, so that the rules were automatically enforced. Also, although I have played it just once, I suspect the victory conditions may cause the game to end too often in a draw - which did happen to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty good hidden movement game.  For the guards (lion clan) it is a deduction game with some strategic elements.  For the ninja/traitor side, its a combination of bluffing and resources management as you try to puzzle your way to the goals.  The balance between the two sides is good, and both players have a lot to do. 

As the intruders, you are working to conserve your resources carefully until you get inside the castles then hopefully you have enough cards to avoid the onslaught of guards which will come your way.  

As the guards, you are hoping to be lucky and catch the intruders early, but also positioning your forces to make it difficult on the intruder and prepare so that if the intruder is located you can pounce.  

The tension when the stuff hits the fan is really excellent.  Nothing like playing a listen card and the other player says "yes" you heard something, then moving through some nearby areas hoping to hit the other player.  

The game isn't perfect though, far from it.  The rulebook is very poorly laid out, instead of explaining things in order, it has different sections for everything, so instead of reading about combat in the phase where it might occur, there is a reference to "see page 12" and you read about it later.  
The rulebook issues make it tough to learn and teach the game, which are very important things in hidden movement games.  Unlike a game where movement is public knowledge, in a hidden movement game, asking a rules question can reveal your plans.  Also, the players can't police each other for rules violations since you don't know what the scorpion player is doing. 

I also think the game missed the L5R flavor.  This could be a generic ninja game and you would never be able to tell.  

Despite these niggling criticisms, I thought the game was very fun and original.  Its a lot quicker than others in the genre, and produces some interesting tension when the guards are chasing the ninja/traitor around.

Nice components, interesting game play

Played twice.
Too long for what it is.
Next to impossible to win as the guards, as even if you kill both opponents, if it's before turn #9, they come back...What's the point?
To help the guards, if you did not draw an attack card, you can't do anything even if you find the opponents.  Really?
Don't intend to play this again.

One play, and it was loathed by everyone except me. Hmm. I thought it was intense and nicely thematic. As the ninja I felt like I was always in trouble until we made our escape. The guard players, on the other hand, claimed to be hamstrung by the lack of information and limited cards available. From their perspective the game was an exercise in futility. Given the reaction, I'll probably never get to find out if that's the case. Too bad.

Very nice game. Rules are written well and flows very well with 2 or 3 players. 1 as guards 2 as ninja and traitor. I do not like it as 4 a player and the only reason why I didn't rate it a little higher was because the guards aren't as fun to play as the ninja/traitors.

RATING: 6.5
Hmm...  Interesting title.  I really like the theme: ninja intruders penetrating some property and accomplishing missions.
You can play it 1 vs 1 (i.e. ninjas vs guards) or 2 (each player controlling 1 ninja) vs 1.  Both modes are good.  2 vs 2 - don't bother.

Neat and working ideas here, but the game NEEDS to be played dynamically and fast to be fun.  Too much of analysis kills the fun, destroys the pace, tension and excitement. There's not enough in the game to keep it interesting for 2,5-3h.  2h is tops, 1-1,5h being preferable time marks.
  DON'T play it with down-timers and slow thinkers.

The game seems to be visibly harder for intruders.  
But the bigger problem is that playing ninjas is much more exciting and fulfilling than playing guards (too much of blind guessing)...

All in all, good game, but I don't feel compelled to own it.  I'm content knowing that my buddies have it.

Sold.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2012)

Perhaps the best Moyersoen game I have played. That is NOT high praise as I have disliked most of his games. Ninja: Legend of the Scorpion Clan is very reminiscent of Nuns on the Run, a game on my black list (I refuse to play it). For me, It is more fun to play as the Ninjas.

The good. The game art and components are very well done. I like the hidden movement mechanic. Great theme.
The Bad. Very low tension. I got bored very quickly. Lots of uncontrollable luck (it is mostly luck if you find the location quickly or not). I think it is very hard for the Ninjas to win as you will give away your position sooner rather than later, so I think the game has balance issues. Too long for what it offers.

It was a good idea, but I don’t like the game. I don’t have any desire to play this, but if I do, most likely I will downgrade its rating.

Current Rating: 4.0

I enjoyed my first play.  This game is yet another confirmation that I really enjoy hidden movement/deduction style games.  This game, surprisingly, had plenty to make it different from Letters from Whitechappel, Shadows Over Camelot, and Scotland yard.  My one complaint is that it had some coop issues where one player can easily take over a team's decisions.

I could see this moving up in the future.

This is a fun take on hidden movement, with a little hand management thrown in. Unlike the staples of the genre (Scotland Yard, Letters from Whitechapel), this game uses card play to provide the players' actions. It works really well and provides a faster, but still tense, game. Looking forward to more plays.

The rule of this game cause alot of frustration. 
You can make a mistake and cheat without knowing.

The game can be unbalanced if the ninja is unlucky and look all over the place for the mission, or the guard have very little indication where the ninja is.

However we did like this game. You do feel like you are a ninja and guard while playing this game and gets really exciting because you are constantly hiding and trying to catch each other.

Hidden movement game themed on Ninjas infiltrating a small "palace". Play 2-4 players, with 2 sides: intruders vs guards.

I'd really recommend this game. It's very interesting playing both sides as the samurai player always has to be attentive trying to find out the traitor's and the ninja's position. Playing the traitor and the ninja is also very fascinating as you are always trying to be as stealthy as possible while aiming to search as many areas in the castle and trying to always have at least one escape route at all times. A very intriguing game which would spark the interest of anyone!

RATING: 6.5
The luck factor is just so strong and therefore, could make for swings in results and frustration. Playing the game, the mechanics and the theme is fun. I liked the tension, the theme, the level of frustration as I tried to hunt the Intruders down and exasperation as my Guards got zapped. Eventually, it became obvious where he had to go which made it a bit of an anti-climax. Trouble is, its just not as satisfying as I had hoped because of the luck factor and therefore, disappointing. Having said that, I do expect that with numerous plays, the luck will even out somewhat and the extreme search results will not be the norm.

Sounds like a great deductive game.

Two sides each can have multiple players. The 'bad guys' try to achieve objectives and the guards try to stop them. This all happens with hidden movement. Does require honesty.

It could be argued that Ninja is not really a board game.

Sure it uses a game board, but the gameplay itself is like a glorified toy in which two players- a ninja and a traitor- try to sneak into a fortification and complete their sinister missions whilst up to 2 other players control the keep's guards and try to find and kill the intruders.

It has a great novelty value and after 10 plays the fun has yet to wear off. Obviously the most entertainment is to be had being the intruders, but there's still plenty of strategy involved in the careful manoeuvring of the patrols and sentries by the Guard player which can make the game tense and exciting.

I've noticed that the time it takes intruders to be killed is getting quicker and quicker as we play more games. The game's balance lies with the actions of the Guard player and as we all become more skilled at managing the Patrols and Sentries the intruders are struggling even more to make it to the end of the game!

We try to avoid player elimination by restarting if one of the intruders gets taken out by a lucky move early on.

If it has one fatal flaw its that the Guard player can too easily camp Sentries on top of all the objective spaces (he knows where they are after all), resulting in a game braking situation in which the Ninja and Traitor are left totally unable to search the spaces they need without getting themselves killed in the process. Perhaps some kind of house rule that forces Guards to automatically move out of unexplored spaces after a full turn or something similar would fix this.. 

Ninja is still THE 3 player game of choice- its perfect with 3 players, and that is a player quantity with few other options!

Will the fun wear off? Maybe, but for now its pretty sweet. Rating holding on 7 as its passed the test of time and is still as fun as it was to start with, as well as having that 3 player sweet spot.

Progressive Rating: 7-8-7.

A really interesting and thematic version of Scotland Yard with a few more bells and whistles. 

Here the players take on the roles of an Assassin and Sabotuer or the Samuarai Guards charged with the task of protecting the Castle Fortress. 

The infiltrators are trying to complete 2 secret missions, with their objectives always being found in the 2 central Castles within the complex. They of course move using a hidden movement mechanism but the Guard player can use a variety of techniques such as listening and actively searching to try and gain information as to the enemy's whereabouts. 

The game is driven using a deck for each side and the whole experience works well and can be thrilling at times. 

I really enjoyed this and the theme only added to the game.

Incredibly solid stealth/deduction entry. As a hidden movement game it serves as a solid  mid-point between a purely deduction game like Letters from Whitechapel and the more "gamey" character/power-driven experience of the later Specter Ops. In fact I would go as far as saying that the only thing this game is missing is the variable player characters, options and scenarios that Specter Ops brought to the concept.

Otherwise this did the same thing years before and just as effectively. Probably not that good of an investment now that Specter Ops is around, but still... the L5R counts for a lot.

It also has to be said that playing the Ninjas is waaay more fun than playing the guards.

RATING: 8.1
Just looks incredible that you have ninjas but instead of an abstract way they are represented through hidden movement and the guard has hidden movement too through traps and so forth. I love the idea of a dual sided scotland yard which I love plus I love ninjas. Reviews for it arn't amazing but looks well worth it and fun enough for replayability.
----------------------------------------------
Update: purchased the game and find it to be amazingly fun, balanced, thematic, slick, satisfying with high replayability and polished rules. Only downsides are:

It would be nice if there were some player reference cards or the player screens had references on them for rules that are good to always know and turn orders

In how they were described the rules were a little wonky to understand, could have been explained better.

That being said the game is amazing and fun and full of satisfying skill-based fun. I recommend it and find it to be incredibly UNDERRATED!
-------------------------------
New favorite Hidden movement game. I love how both sides have something hidden to keep secret in different ways. I love how there's a little combat without having too much. I love how it's not too complex but there are varied elements to make the theme come to life like different alert levels for the guards, patrols vs. sentries, hidden guards and traps, special moves by ninja and traitor, using rope to climb walls, secret passages. Ah, everything about this game represents the theme so well without being bogged down by too much complexity or fiddlyness. I'm using the BGG rating system here: This is a game I will ALWAYS want to play. And once everyone knows the rules, provided you're not playing with fat, slow, unfun, people who take a million years per turn (I don't invite them anyway) the game plays extremely quickly with a fast and exciting pace! LOVE IT!

My favorite deduction game to date.  Thematic! Actually Fun! I normally hate area/who-done-it deduction games; I love this !! Not a light game at all. Plays over 60 minutes.

Great with 2 players. Plays great with 3, where the intruders play co-op. Plays great with 4, where 2 sides play co-op. I have yet to play the lone wolf variant.

A little difficult to learn/teach because of many intricate rules and situations, but after the first game many things click.  

I personally have yet to see competent guards win against competent intruders.

This hidden-movement-based team game took the basic concepts of Scotland Yard and placed them in the context of feudal Japan.  This is a good system for that theme, but the game itself seemed to move very slowly at times--often multiple turns would go by with nothing of note happening.  I'm not really a fan of this type of game anyway, and here I found the pacing to be far too slow for me.

This game probably shines with 2 players. And it has similarities with other hidden movement games, like 'Scotland Yard'. The theme is pretty well represented in the game play mechanics.

It's definitely a great looking game with a fairly interesting take on the hidden movement mechanics, but I felt very out of control for the majority of the time. It seems like the guards can't do much of anything until the intruders are already inside the castle and it's easy to lose track of them after an attack, which leads to some odd ups and downs in the action of the game.

It seems the one thing that makes the game work is the limit of cards both sides have. It's the only thing keeping players from running around killing each other without worry, and at the same time, it can feel a bit too restricting. For example- I could find the ninja with my Sentry using a search card, then attack him with a kenjutsu card, but if I'm now out of search cards that Sentry pretty much has to forget he just saw an intruder. Overall, there's fun to be had here, but I worry about how much control players really have.

This one fell flat for me and our play group and is my least favorite hidden movement game that I have played. For a pretty simple game, there are lots of little rules to remember and it makes people not want to return to the game.

I also don't like the game doesn't reward the guards (or punish the intruder) for bad intruder play. What I mean by this is that the intuder can use sloppy play and/or go crazy searching areas in the early game because if they are killed before turn ten, you pretend that it was just a decoy and the intruder gets a redo to start again on the board. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I can imagine this game being greatly enjoyed by some players (especially those who like the L5R world), but this just isn't for me.  It's pretty novel and neat in its mechanics, but the fact that the ninjas respawn if killed and that the secret passage can, if put in a very lucky spot, can entirely thwart the guards makes this a bit unsatisfying.  

I think I'd just as soon play Mr. X, because at least if I catch him he can't just send a new Mr. X on the run, nor can he pop a lucky Subway right (secret passage) right out beside his objective and win.

moderately accessible Thematic Game

How in the hell is this game not more popular? I just don't understand it. How can Spectre Ops, a fine but vastly inferior game, get so much more press? This one meshes with theme perfectly, the sneaking around by one player feels exciting for the guards, the map feels like a real Japanese castle, the deduction is delicious...

I prefer to play the guards, which is great for everyone I've ever played with.

Had a great trio of games with a Warhammer 40K friend of mine--the first game he snuck around in a perfectly predictable manner, I nailed him easily. The second game he ran straight int he front gates with his sword drawn, pretty much just screaming for blood. Again, cut him down easily. He declared the game 'the anti-Warhammer 40k', which he considered an insult but I considered a compliment. But he got back on the horse, tried again, this time by performing the craziest sequence of moves I've ever seen done in the game--he spent almost half of the game hiding in the inner moat, just circling around, before walking directly toward my men recklessly, needlessly--and completely unpredictably, it turned out, as I decided he would never do that and went the opposite way. As a result, he won handily. A thrilling match! He finally got the game, to our mutual delight.

RATING: 7
A very fun and extremely thematic two-three player hidden movement game (don't play it with four). Not as deep and analytical as Letters from Whitechapel, but somewhat more accessible. Tested on non-gamers with success, some requested it explicitly later. Quite a lot of randomness  - you can find your objective as an intruder almost immediately or as the last searched area, as guards you always have to guess between several possible locations of the intruders - but surprisingly I don't mind it. It's pretty intense, with intruders sweating and hoping not to be discovered by using all tricks they can think of.

Hidden Movement, Assymetric. One player/team is the Scorpion clan trying to infiltrate a castle to find hidden objectives, while the other is the Lion clan trying to stop them. We played 2v2 guards vs. ninja/accomplice and had a good time. Clever listen and search mechanism make the hidden movement really shine. The ninja side *might* have the advantage, but can't really say after just one play.

We all liked it, but not sure how often we'd be able to get it to the table.

I am biased. Let me start out by saying that. 
Since I love the world of L5R, I had so much fun trying it as a boardgame and not only a CCG (haven't tried the RPG).

This is a wonderful stealth game for 2-4 players where almost all movement and action is marked on a sheet of paper. Ninja vs Guard, where the guards are supposed to catch and prevent the Ninja from completing it's mission, and the Ninja in turn have to, of course, carry it's mission out and escape, and have to take time into consideration, and the faster the ninja moves, the easier it is for the guards to locate him by the sound he makes. 

Try this one :)

Sort of like an attempt at Tenchu: The Boardgame -- ninjas sneaking past guards to assassinate the daimyo in his castle. One player controls the infiltrators, the other player the guards. (Variants are included for 3-4 players.) The guards move around the board, but ninja movement is hidden; the ninja player has to reveal used cards (ropes, killing guards etc.) but otherwise only appears if a guard wanders past. Production is great and there are a number of delightful thematic touches, like playing alcohol cards to turn alert guards into useless drunken ones.

Unfortunately it just doesn't quite work. Structurally, the problem is that the ninja objective is hidden in one of 19 spaces. Searching a space reveals their presence to the guards, so a game in which the objective is found quickly will be [i]much[/i] easier than one without.

For the guard player, the key problem is the unsatisfying deductive experience. There is no arc of discovery as in Letters from Whitechapel (where the location of Jack's hideout is gradually narrowed down), just a clumsy game of Marco Polo. The key there is that the police can pick up Jack's [i]trail[/i]; here, the only surefire way of locating an assassin is blundering into one. There are a lot of educated guesses made with unthematic infrequency.

Nor is this particularly enjoyable for the ninja player, who may well become frustrated by their inability to find the objective or by dying at the hands of bumbling guards.

Great theme and great components, with solid execution compared to older games like Clue: The Great Museum Caper. It just suffers greatly by comparison to Letters from Whitechapel, or even the similarly-themed King & Assassins.

It seems that these hidden identity/hidden movement games are a little like Marmite in that you love them or you hate them. I really enjoy them, and this one does well at creating a good story in the playing. Yes, there is probably an optimal strategy for both sides, but the game is easily scalable, and above all is fun. Not to be taken too seriously, so more fun with new gamers.

I love this game. An awesome deductive game with lots of different elements for both sides to use. As the infiltrators especially you have so many little tricks and tools you can use to mislead the guards, it almost becomes a big bluffing game as the guards try and figure out whether you really did climb that rope or whether that cat was covering up anything or just wandering around for the fun of it. I've played this game many times and have found it to be well balanced. The option of a tie is nice too, giving each side something to fight for right to the end.

RATING: 8
Really fun game but it is different from other hidden movement games. You would expect, as the guards, to chase the ninja for the whole game, while the nija tries to escape, but it doesn't work that way.

As the ninja or traitor, you'll attempt to sneak in, accomplish your mission, and sneak out before sunrise without being killed. As the guards, you'll have to set up multiple traps, and wait patiently for the intruders to trigger an alarm. You then have to act quickly and kill them before they disappear again into the night. 

It is a game of waiting, moving carefully, and then springing into action for a short time, then going back to the waiting game. Some might be put off by this.

As the ninja, your cards will be limited so you have to manage them carefully. As the guards, you try to push the intruders to show themselves, which will raise the alarm which in turn will allow you to have more actions at your disposal.

It is a game of waiting, of risk taking, of deduction, and a bit of luck.

The listening cards is a clever mechanic that you need to take advantage of if you want to be successful as the guards.

I could see the game falling apart if the intruders get lucky and discover their objectives quickly, but it has never happened to me yet.

The rules could have been a bit more streamlined. They are mostly easy, but something in there makes them not as easy to remember as they should.

Ninja:LotSC turns the secret movement genre on its head by having one visible player try to find all of the other hidden players.  That sounds impossible, but the visible player has up to 20 pawns to work with.  The rulebook should be thrown out by the publisher and rewritten; this could be taught in 5 minutes in plain-English.  No other secret movement game offers such a lush theme and the production values are fantastic.  If you like the genre, this may be the best option to own.

The night is quiet, but somewhere in the darkness shadows are moving. A ninja and a double-crossing samurai sneak into the Lion Clan castle, intent on completing their dastardly tasks. Though alert, the Lion guards are as yet unaware that anything is amiss...

This tense standalone game pits Lion Clan samurai guards against a Scorpion Clan ninja and his traitor ally. As the ninja or the traitor, you will use hidden movement to sneak into the castle, eliminate guards, find your mission objective, and escape. As the guards, you will use your wits and superior numbers to thwart the sinister Scorpion.

In this exciting new game set in the world of Legend of the Five Rings, you must use your limited resources, powers of deduction, and a touch of guile to outthink and outmanoeuvre your opponent. Daring, planning, and a little luck will determine whether you triumph or meet your end on 3 feet of steel.

4 players, a draw after Ninja escape on turn 16 or so. Took many hours, mainly due to the need for each team to plan their next action (with the other team being sent away from the board), though also maybe because we gave the Samurai 3hp and the Ninja 2 which prolonged the former's life.  I liked playing the game but regretted spending so much time on it, and won't play it again with 4.

This game does a decent job of capturing the concept of infiltration with hidden movement, but it does have its flaws. After you get accustomed to the rules and play through a few times, you start to see exploits that warp the theme of sneaking vs. guarding significantly.

Placing guards in all the objective locations makes a silent infiltration impossible and pretty much requires the Ninja player to carry a handful of death-dealing cards.

As the Ninja player, if you are spotted, it is often easier to simply charge around hunting out objectives at 3 moves/turn, then sprint out of the complex rather than to slip into a hiding spot and wait for the alarm to subside before continuing to be a ninja.

I find that both these situations tend to break the immersion of the game and tend to lead to games falling into a fight of exploits rather than a true hide-and-seek type game.

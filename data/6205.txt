From the Reviews: This looks like a really good game, and with a gaming friend who would spend all day Saturday playing this game then I think I would pick it up. The 6 rating stems from the fact that playing time is enormous so I would only play it sporadically.

I'm a huge fan of [thing=20609][/thing], which led me to this.  I figured it would be Asia Engulfed for Europe, but it didn't work nearly as well.  With so few areas in the Soviet Union, why are there blocks?  Fog of War kind of loses meaning.
    The naval system wasn't nearly as good, but that's no fault of the game as much as the theater.
    Lots and lots of chrome with this one, such as the number of minor allies.
    I think the perfect, or for that near matter, near perfect WWII European theater doesn't exist.  This is as close as I have seen, but not good enough for me to want to keep.

This game takes the complex problem of military, economic and political issues associated with the European theater of WWII and molds it into a very exciting, very enjoyable and very playable game. There are many rules to remember but it is relatively easy to do so because they are typically very intuitive. They just make sense given the spatial and temporal scales of the game and the political and economic challenges of that era. The basic simplicity of the mechanics enables the game to proceed surprisingly quickly (given its magnitude).

Turns out I really like block games - or other games with hidden units/fog of war. This and Asia Engulfed would be a great way to play through WWII. Would really like this game.

While the description below is fairly accurate (my original rating was an eight), The truth of the matter is that [i]Triumph and Tragedy[/i] has taken its spot on the table. I will probably never play this one again. This is not a game you can simply set up and play -- you [b]need[/b] to plan to play it, and I just don't have the time. Plus, if I did have the time, why wouldn't I play a lot more [i]Triumph and Tragedy[/i] instead?

[i]"Probably one of the most playable monsters out there. The Strategic Warfare part of the game felt heavy and unnecessary, but the game on the board was a thing of beauty."[/i]

Manageable WWII strategic games. Block concept is always good to simulate fog of war. A good 10  hour investment (but playing through wargameroom software saves a lot of playing time) but needs also a lot of space.
Maybe unbalanced in favour of allies, but bidding for sides fix everything (and is included in the rules).

Axis and Allies for grownups.

Actually that's unfair; while the rules complexity isn't a lot higher, the tactics and strategy are much deeper. It's also surprisingly good as a simulation for such a simple game (the sea supply rules come to mind).

I have only one small quibble, the importance of the relatively few die rolls made to represent the U-boat war.

I don't consider myself a wargamer but this game could seriously sway me. It is quite simply stunning. 

Games played show the date that the game was started (gets left set up on a pool table)

After 3 full campaigns and one Scenario I am starting to get a true feel for the game. 
But I have to be "in the mood" to play it. Not to be taken lightly.

All plays in 2012/2013 are of one full campaign. The board is left setup in my loft and we are completing a few turns at a time when we can make time at the weekend.

So far I've played the One Map scenario once and currently I'm playing the 1939 Campaign using Cyberboard.  I love watching the war unfold, it's a great history lesson.

Update: Played a few more games.  The 1941 Campaign as Germany - lost, the Tournament scenario as Russia - lost. Barbarossa One-Mapper - A win and a loss.  I'm used to tactical games like ASL so this requires a whole new way of thinking; It's going to take time to wrap my head around it all!  Upgraded my rating from 8 to 9.

Great game. Best gameplay and well thought rules. Playing Germany you have to hit fast and hard. Waiting too long to conquer France gives the French player to much time so he can muster to many troops. He can sit thight then till there are no frogs in France anymore. In the meantime the Russian player builds more tanks than you can handle. Playing the 43-Scenario was the best thing. Pure Action. Beware of the many German action-markers.

If I could give guys like Rick Young a rating, it would be higher than a ten.  I am willing to support his designs because he is such a stand-up guy.  This is one reason why I am on the P-500 list for his "Fast Action Bulge."

As far the EE goes, well, I am not so sure.  Lawrence Hung, with whom I sometimes disagree, has expressed many of my "concerns" in his comments.  Europe Engulfed just strikes me as new version of Avalon Hill's Third Reich, with blocks instead of counters, WRP's instead of BRP's (why re-invent the wheel?  Why not just give credit where credit is due?).  The comments for AH's 3R show many Geeks holding their noses while they trash the game.  Yet, EE is embraced by all.  Hmmmmmm . . . .

And with combat decided by buckets and buckets of dice, why, it's just RISK with blocks instead of wooden cubes.  Blah!

Allow me to quote Mr. Hung:

"Production is handled by WERP ("War Effort Resources Points"), something similar to Third Reich's BRP ("Building Resources Points") whereby players spend them to build up new units and purchase replacements. Naval action is completely left out in Blockskerig version but I doubt the full version can handle it completely afresh. Victory in a campaign game can only be determined by the end of 1945 to see how long the Reich could survive. At a strategic level game like this, it could have been much more tense if a year by year victory conditions could be phased in (like something in the Russian Campaign). Overall, a game which lacks colours and flavours. It does not add motives for players to do things aggressively, other than repeating what we had known about the history. The political considerations also scripted the game to a historical line where a nation cannot declare a war before a certain date. The designer seems to throw in a mix of herbs from the games like Third Reich's ambition, Columbia's blocks, Axis and Allies' dice-rolling and area movement, TSR's Europe Aflame's scale flavour, and boiling them all over in one pot again. The final taste is a rather disappointment from GMT recently, considered the rather well-received card driven series games."

Rated after one play. I was very intimidated by the complexity of the game. I have been reading the rules for a long time, and still I felt that the heavy rules make this game almost not worth the effort.

I have clearly moved on from my days of loving Grand Strategic WW2 - it's too hard to break out from history with these monsters. You always get restricted to one or two strategic directions, and woe betide you if you stray from them. As usual, as Germany you get destroyed if you let the game go on long enough; I got destroyed two years ahead of schedule because we were all learning the game and I clearly sucked at it!

Would play again, given available time - it solves many of the problems of the old Eurofront games, and plays quite fast once you're into it. I doubt my opponents would be champing at the bit to let me back in! Despite the fact that it's the abstraction that makes the game such a good one, I definitely DON'T like all the exceptions to the rules that give the powers their distinctiveness - You shouldn't butt up against a rule system, it should allow you to do what you want, and in this game it's far more often the former - the designer just says "NO!" and there's no recourse.

Have played in two games. One ending in Jan/Feb 1941 and another in in July/August 1942. Both games I would class as learning scenarios, even though they were attempts at tackling the full Campaign Game without optional rules. I have just one chief doubt about the game:  the progressions and returns for the U-Boat/ASW campaign charts seemed to be skewed significantly in favor of the Axis. Otherwise, pretty fun. It often felt like I was playing a charts-and-special-cases version of A&A Europe.

This game is just too long for my current tastes, and I'm not sure the block/fog of war really works at this level, you have a good idea what your opponent is doing in each theatre even if the actual detail is fogged, just seems to add to the play length rather than shorten it. Also feels quite scripted (but I suppose any historical simulation of this scale will) haven't played it enough (and doubt I will) to explore everything but it seems that it comes down to the Russian front in the end, everything else is dancing around trying to distract or pull resources away from that theatre.Overall I'd much rather play other block games, and I can't see me ever owning a copy.

A game of depth and breadth, yet easy to learn.  The rules are well written and comprehensive.  Rule and gameplay questions are readily answered by the game's designer(s) right here on BGG, as well as ConSimWorld forums, usually within hours of posting them.  The historical feel is great, the gameplay is quick and involves each player most of the time, so downtime is not an issue.  The addition of a streamlined set of rules for introducing the game (called Blockskrieg!) is a definite plus.  Add the fact that there are several scenarios depicted, not just 1939-1945 WW-II typical of other grand strategy titles, and you have a great game with plenty of replay value!

What a beauty!  Long, and weighty, but rewarding.  iEE, the interactive online version, means that I can play this game much more frequently than others of its length.  (See www.wargameroom.com).

If I have one complaint, it's that repeated games can seem a bit same-y, and it feels like there are only a few decisions to make.  However, mitigating this is the fact that once a decision is made there is usually a lot of careful planning and execution that needs to be done properly in order to achieve the chosen goal.

I traded for this in the hope that it would move my kids up from their Axis and Allies/TripleA stage and it did.  It has enough chrome that I can play along and enough simplicity that my kids can grasp even the most challenging of rules and strategies.  Played once and it will be back on the gaming table.

A comment on the Victory Conditions: It has been suggested that there should be year-on-year sudden-death victory conditions, but this sort of thing is hugely problematic in WWII ETO games. The playing experience is based heavily on the fact that the Germans get to hammer people early but get their comeuppance later when the Soviet and US steamrollers get going. To end a '41 - '45 game early because the Soviets hung on a little better on defense would be somewhat unsatisfying, and it would encourage "victory or bust" hyper-offensive German play more than is reasonable. The Germans can already cause problems by pushing the offensive in Russia so hard in quest for the automatic victory that they simply implode in '42, which is fine for them but unsatisfying for the Allies, as they don't get to play an interesting phase of the game.
---
A routine comment UPDATE:
While I don't play EE as much as I used to, I got a lot of fun hours out of this game, and I remain a big fan ... it's just time-consuming to play. I always prefer to play Summer '41 to the end ('39-'41 is more a matter of technique than skill, and just not all that interesting), but even that's a full day's gaming. Good fun, but a full day.

The game does not cover political events or alternate possible strategy paths, and that's arguably a legitimate weakness. On the other hand, very few games that allow that sort of thing do it very well (EuroFront is the only one I've played). EE is a bit of a railroad job - you're going to go through the historical motions for the most part - but on an operational level there is significant flexibility: you can pick your objectives in Russia, and the Allies have lots of invasion options. The real tough choices though come in how to spend your WERPS - Special Actions, elite units, tanks, infantry, strategic warfare, and fleets all compete for your attention and even at the height of the US's power, there is far more to buy than you can afford. So choices here make a big difference, and are what makes the game compelling I think. Too many of these games have you just buying out what your force pool allows you, with not enough tension in this regard.

There has been some criticism leveled at the game for unrealistically hammering Britain in '40-'42, and I think that's fair ... the U-Boat campaign is brutal, and while the U-Boats did come close to strangling the UK economy for a time (apparently the U-Boats were the only thing that seriously worried Churchill), it was for a very short time, not the extended crippling the subs inflict here. Also, the reversal of the U-Boat threat happened fairly rapidly once long-range aircraft and other better ASW techniques and tactics came on line; in EE it's going to be a protracted struggle. It's OK, I think it falls into the category of nit-pick rather than serious complaint, and the plus side is that it gives the Germans some legitimate options, but I think the subs probably are a bit too hard on the UK in the '40-'41 timeframe. This is somewhat counterbalanced by the fact that the US can bring many more ground forces to the fray in 1942 and 1943 than is at all plausible from a historical perspective, but this is somewhat unsatisfying balance for the Anglophiles amongst us.

Speaking of which, I highly recommend the increasing US production schedule rather than the flat rate. The flat rate production allows the US to field far too many troops too early.

Also, #1 tip for new Axis players: You *must* max out your U-Boats if humanly possible. They are potent weapons against the Western Allies, and without them the British and Americans can bring crushing force to bear against you far too quickly. Trust me, the 8 WERPS/turn through '43 will be money well spent. Neglect the U-Boats at your peril.

Who wants to fiddle with unruly piles of cardboard, when you can drive solid, 3D blocks across Europe?  

This is sweep of history, and just right for those of us with little time for tiny tactical detail or extensive bookkeeping. The map is superbly well-designed, perhaps the best I've seen for ease of use and scale. The sister game, Asia Engulfed, is arguably even better. 

E&E has been replaced in my collection by Triumph & Tragedy. T&T has a similar feel to Europe Engulfed. although it is less detailed. Unconditional Surender is less streamlined, plays slower but has the edge over all of these grand strategic WW2 games in terms of design.

RATING: 5
The amount of historical chrome in the rules kept me from seeing, for awhile, that this is indeed Axis & Allies with blocks.  Like Axis & Allies, it is vastly popular among people who value gameplay over historical narrative, and who think strictly in terms of losses/money and not board position.

The heart of the game is economics, by which I mean, the WERP system ensures that everything can be considered in terms of everything else. What matters is the size of your army, nothing else. Any expenses you can avoid as the Germans results in you having a larger army for Barbarossa. While there is a build limit on the number of, say, U-boats or bombers you can build per turn, there is no limit on the number of infantry or tanks you can build per turn.  As a result, savings anywhere can be translated immediately into more and more ground units.  This is huge for the Axis because, unlike the Soviets, their maximum budget is fixed but their expenses are not.  By a certain play style they can minimize expenses and translate that directly into a much larger German army in 1941.

If the Axis does not invade Norway, for example, the losses they don't take, the Special Actions they don't spend, the pricey paratroops they don't buy, the northern garrisons they don't need, the ships they don't build, are directly translatable into WERPs which can be spent on making the German forces as large as possible for Barbarossa.  If the Germans can (and they can) take the northern swamps in Russia, the lend-lease route is cut anyway, and Norway becomes rather irrelevant - plus the Germans are a significant step closer to conquering the USSR by cutting off Leningrad.

Good German play is very streamlined, totally directed at achieving a sufficient mass of force that the USSR can be conquered every game.  No WERPs are wasted on Africa, Norway, grants to Italy, buying GSUs, buying FLAK, buying fighters, buying field forts, or anywhere else that does not result in a very short term return to profitability and a maximum ground force for the invasion of Russia.  This large disincentive for Germany's historical "expenditures" is a major turn-off for me.

In the USSR, the Russians, when confronted with a gigantic bowling ball of a German stack that can be used to move and attack six or seven times a turn using SAs, have as their best option curling up in the southeast, in a Heavy Fort in Stalingrad along with forces in the adjacent hills where tanks don't get their bonus.  If you examine photos of EE games from tournaments etc you will see this position again and again - the Soviet superstack in Stalingrad, the Germans owning virtually the rest of the board except for Grozny and Baku.  (If they get those spaces they will win in short order.)   I played against a number of opponents and saw this every game, instead of a historical give and take on the steppes.  The Soviets might not win by doing this, due to running out of time, but at least they can often avoid outright conquest.

Similarly the Allies, facing ridiculous supply bottlenecks in the Med, as well as the difficulty of invading Sicily, and the strong need to rescue the Soviets, have large incentives to invade France in 1943 and skip Italy altogether.  Experienced Allied players rarely bother with Italy, especially if the Soviets are getting creamed by the German super-army strategy.

So it doesn't play anything like history.  That is not to say it is a bad game, but though you might think it is a historical simulation based on reading the rules, it doesn't play like one.  It plays like a game with tons of dice, a few large areas with no real maneuver, and gigantic stacks of pieces fighting each other.  It plays like Axis & Allies.  For better or worse.

Nice, manageable step up from Axis & Allies.  Start with Blockskrieg rules subset, and work your way up.  Game is not as free-form as A&A--the section of the rules on political considerations is significant, and moves the game forward along historical lines.

Have played 3 test games by now, and all have been very enjoyable. The rules are fairly easy to learn and they come across as very intuitive. I appreciate particularly (of course) the Special Action system, and also the rules for naval operations are nicely thought out. Down sides? First all of all, I'd say the time it takes to play - 8-9 hours play time have only taken us into 1942, and although experience will cut a few hours off, I imagine future games will start with the 1941-scenario, which obviously "scripts" the game along actual historical lines - a classic WWII gaming issue.
And last... I've seen close to 30 die without a single hit (6'er) - I know that's likely to even out over an entire game, but when it happens it just really makes me wish the designers had adopted some sort of fire tabel. 
Rating may go up to 8 or down to 7, pending.

Please take this rating with salt.  In many ways this is not a fair rating of the game in that I'm not a fan of wargames, and in particular am not a fan of games with as many large random elements as EE has.  I am not a member of any sort of target audience for this game.

That all said and admitted, there is obvious depth, delicacy and subtlety to this game with a wide range of possible valid approaches.  It does appear to be well balanced given the caveat that the Allies are more difficult to play well (but if played well, are well balanced).

One of my favorite games.  This game hits the sweet spot in terms of detail and breadth of choices with playable and time commitment.  I love the tactile feel of the blocks, and the grand scope of the map and gameplay.  The blocks introduction of  fog of war adds another dimension not usually found in strategic level games.

The fluidity of movement and opportunities introduced by the special actions mechanic is awesome, and causes intense swings on emotion as you go from convinced you'll lose to confident in victory, several times in the course of the game.  

I look forward to playing more, and to more games (FAB Bulge and Asia Engulfed) from the same designers.

Prepare for some lengthy time getting to understand the details of sticker application!  Looks like a great game, very interested to play!  Well, I finally played this monster, and it was indeed enjoyable.  Starting at the 1939 campaign for your first game, though, is probably not a good idea.  Much seems to be programmed around certain events occurring, most notably the fall of Paris.  It took myself and my friend some time to wrap our heads around the political details of each nation, but they're not completely overwhelming.  I'm looking forward to playing this again, but it's a tough one to get out.

Excellent WWII Wargame played with wooden blocks for Fog of War aspect. Reflects history very well and has lots of support from the designer. Time to play varies but generally takes 15 hours for average players. Once the game is learned, time can be brought down to 10 hours, meaning it could be playerd in one very long day.

Great wargame with "Fog of War" (using blocks). In my eyes the best WW II European Front Strategic Wargame (at least until Storm Europa from Academy Games is published).
The BIG disadvantage is the time (2 days) you need for the full campaign (1939-45).

Addictive game of WWII in Europe.  Tremendous support from the Designers (Rick Young and Jesse Evans).  Some complain that the rules (especially the nation specific rules) put players into a historical "straight-jacket".  I totally disagree.  Some may like a WWII "simulation" where the US can join the Axis or Italy joins the Allies in 1940.  But for my tastes, games that permit such things are more fantasy than "simulation".   The rules need some digesting, but the basic procedure for play is extremely simple.   This is a very enjoyable game.  It takes a long time, but the time really flies when you are playing.   Looking forward to the arrival of its sister game, Asia Engulfed.

Okay, after playing this three times using iEE I must say the game frustrated me to no end.  Sometimes in a good way like when I had to make some tough decisions but mostly in a irritating way due to a lot of exceptions, a lot of can't do's --thank goodness for rules enforcement of iEE.  But, there was a glimmer of greatness - - there's a feeling having a strategic simulation and a game with plausible historical diversions.  I can see this being a 9 or 10 between two or three knowledgable players.  Hopefully I'll attain that ability and perhaps rate the game accordingly.  This could be a classic with me (and hopefully my son) for many years.

Watch out--while the high ratings for this game are likely justified, they probably only apply to people who would already be inclined to like a complex and very long (10-14 hours for experienced players) WWII game.  If that sounds like your cup of tea, I say go for it, but otherwise tread with caution.  I suspect that the high rating stems in part from the fact that people who don't like very long games no better than to try this one--of course it also comes from the fact that the people who DO try it tend to like it a lot.

GMT Games.  Simply an amazing block, double blind, large area movement war game.  This game combines Avalon Hill's Third Reich and Axis & Allies for the grand European Theater.  You control the build up of your forces.  Strategic warfare is present.  Elite military units can be built.  The flow of the war as it developed from 1939 to the wars end can follow a similar trajectory. This war game is an amazing polished game design and lets players play the whole war in 15 - 30 hours of play.  Either side can win.  And like most well designed war games, the best expert player of Europe Engulfed generally wins due to his strategy and tactics - regardless of all the tons of dice rolls made through out game play.  Europe Engulfed is one of my favorite war games of all time.

A well-designed ETO block game.  While some of the rules are are little complicated to understand at first (e.g. fleets and sea transport), there are numerous exceptions to consider (e.g. Axis minor-powers, Vichy France rules, US invasion rules, etc), and the game requires an enormous amount of space to play, it does an excellent job of emphasizing the land conflict at a scale and level of abstraction that truly works and is quite a rewarding experience.  The special actions are an excellent game mechanic that makes this game shine.  And throwing hundreds of dice is fun.  It's not one I can get on the table too often due to its size and length, but it's one that I certainly enjoy playing.

I would like this game a lot better, if the rules could be edited to swing towards a lower percentage of "special cases" and exceptions.

Fantastic fantastic.  I love this game.  So many possible decisions.  A great basic system - especially the specail actions - with just enough chrome to give flavour.  One of those games where you actually feel like you are understanding history better because you're playing it.  Quite long though.
Rating based on three plays.  (Edit a few years later)  After getting a slightly bigger collection under my belt, I now realize that this game is a big commitment for quite a scripted experience.  It's a great game but your decisions are quite limited overall.  Down from 9 to 7.

RATING: 4
Europe Engulfed is about as well-detailed game covering the second world war as it is possible to make, its  accurate coverage of historical events make it feel like a history lesson.  Here-in lies the problem.

While playing the game I felt that I was totally constricted by history as to what decisions I could make.  There seemed to be a right and wrong decision in each and every situation, there is no room for one's own creative play to come through; you either make the right decision and win (you can always see the right decision if you are prepared to think about it for long enough) or make an irrecoverable bad choice.

The fact that the game takes so long is a problem too, it is almost impossible to learn from one's mistakes as one has to invest another 12 hours to play again.  This game needs to be shorter, and have more accessable rules which one doesn't require a doctarate in advanced 'geekdom' to formulate a strategy around.

I can't comment on whether this is a 'great' wargame.  I can comment on how amazingly awesome this game is as a simulation of 1939 to 1946...  I've had this on my stack of games to be played for years.  Finally played about 24 hours of it over a bleary-eyed weekend.  Each turn has historical events which force game play certain ways, which is interesting (ohmigoodness the Allies get their butt stomped in '39).  And the different ways of abstracting submarine warfare and bombing is quite slick.  It's really too bad that the game takes FORever, 'cuz it's just so evocative of the period of history...  I could hear the trumpets from the Patton movie whenever I looked down at North Africa...

For a strategic wargame on the WWII in Europe this one goes far. Also the tidy the design and the fact that the errata on this game are very limited is a good sign. For a wargame this one is well within the top 10 of good well balanced and enjoyable wargames. As to general boardgames I suppose that for many players the game duration (app. 13h) is a problem, the level of complexity in the game is limited though and I know quite a few well rated boardgames that are lacking in their rulesbooklet when compared to EE.

RATING: 6
Decent block based WWII game. More depth than Axis & Allies, but not as complex as, say, World In Flames.

However, it's still long, and the way some of the strategies work out in practice is goofy. For example, England is usually badly choked by U-Boats for most of the early part of the game, and there's little they can do about it. The large areas on the map lead to units running all over the place, resulting in some gamey maneuvering.

RATING: 8
Impressive to see how many grand-sweeping events can be portrayed in a few hours of smooth play. The Special Actions are a very clever way to implement the manuever of WW2. When they're combined with the fog of war of blocks its a tense & fun game.

A different WWII game than those I usually play, like A&A, 3R and A3R, etc. I have played the Campaign game twice and found it's an interesting system to play with. 
My comments on this game:

Good:
1. Rules are not too complicated, therefore easier to play with compare to the same kind of overall WWII strategy game.
2. Wooden block standup units make hidden movements possible, thus making players to consider more situations and the game more realistic and interesting to play with.

Need to reconsider/improve:
1. Setting up the game is a bit painful at the first time. Also, if you can't finish it on the first day and need to record and set it up the next time to continue, it's more painful.
2. The rules seems to favor Russia too much. E.g. With the weather system in this game, Germans has only two "Clear" turns to attack without suffering any penalties every year.
Also, with the 34WERP and no first point double production rules, Russian can build up her units anywhere and cut Germans supply line easily especially if she wait until the mud turn which all German Armour units are useless.

Personally, if some sort of modifications can be made to balance the Russia vs German effect, it will be more fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This strategic level game offers something of what I expected from The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, a fluid, fascinating Chess match that forces one to consider economic implications and important choke points before rolling immense amounts of dice. As someone who always seemed to get exactly the wrong roll on the CRT in Third Reich, I like a little bit of distribution. I also enjoyed beating a better player who would have trounced me with just "average" die rolls, but hey, I'll take 'em as I can get 'em.

This one manages to do everything right. Stellar art and production, sleek and fast gameplay, full of tough historical decisions. I cannot recommend this one highly enough. 

Some of the smaller rules and exceptions seemed fiddly and hard to remember at first, but after a couple games it all comes together and the small rules add just the right amount of chrome and historical feel. You'll spend a lot of time referencing the rules at first, but stick with it and you'll find one of the most rewarding wargames in years.

One of the best ETO WWII wargames in recent years, large in scope but still potentially accessible to the light fare A&A crowd (as some rule mechanics actually have some similarities). The Special Action system works especially well, and gives the game an interesting unpredictability without cumbersome rules. All in all the game is much more complicated than many think, and some special rules exceptions are well hidden in the rules (which are otherwise well edited) and the end game may drag into an endless dicefest if the axis player simply hoards all his units in a few well defended spaces. But still this is an excellent game that will satisfy many a gamer for years to come.

Very nice game. Awesome underlying core system -- simple to grasp yet deep. 

Only thing preventing a 9+ is the fact that the chrome (political considerations and territory linked specials) for new players or players who don't know takes time, some of which could been alleviated by better map design (the map is beautiful, but big enough that certain areas such as Gibraltar, Silicy, Malta, Ploesti, Oslo, Leningrad, Onega Swamps) could be highlighted as to show beginning players where not so obvious strategic interests lie (especially concerning med theater.)

It's really hard to rate a game that takes 14 hours to play, at least on the BGG scale.

After one play of the full game, I can honestly say that I think this is a great game. The base mechanics are VERY smooth and easy to grasp, and I say this as someone for whom this was the first foray into real wargames.

The exceptions, the political rules, and the other fiddly bits drag it down a little, and I'd love to see what it's like to play just as a straight wargame, politics be damned, but again - one play. I'm sure familiarity with the rules makes it all go a lot smoother.

In the end, it wasn't what I feared it would be, ie a complete walkthrough of the war - our game was almost entirely ahistorical, and I couldn't be happier. It was what I hoped it would be - dramatic, dynamic, and compelling. I can't wait to play again.

A block game covering the entire European theater?! Of course I love it! This game, after one play, seems to me to be a real winner. I like the way the game plays out in a generally historical manner, with Germany having tons of options early on, but never really being able to dominate. Britain and France have to struggle to hang on, balancing the needs of a strong fleet, ASW assets, air power, and flak. Russia is doing very little for quite a while, but when they come in boy do they come in with the manpower. The game uses "special actions," which each nation buys with resources, to recreate some aspects of WWII combat, i.e. blitzkriegs. I like that mechanic quite a bit. As the war progresses, the Germans go from a large special action advantage to a small one, to a point where the allies have a big advantage. This is a nice representation of the impact of allied industrial and technological might starting out at a low level but eventually reeling the Germans in, much like the peleton chases down break away riders.

The game also rewards historical accuracy. Sure, Germany could invade Spain if it wants, but that's a sure fire way to lose the war. In our one game, the German player waited until 1942 to invade Russia. Sure enough, it wasn't worth the extra build up time, as Russia had that many more expendable infantry units. As in the real things, the German offensive ground to a halt in the Russian winter, and Germany's proudest army was annihilated by a massive Russian assault. I can imagine wanting a game that gives players a little more flexibility, rather than, basically, having to pursue the same objective the Germans actually pursued. But this is supposed to be a simulation, and like the way it keeps players "in the box" of history, more or less.

Another element of the game I really like was how it reflects the different scales of combat on the Eastern and Western fronts. Combat against the Western democracies tended to involve maybe ten units each, maybe as many as 25 dice to be rolled per combat round, per side. Not on the Eastern Front! The final battle we fought before Germany conceded included something like 30 Russian units rolling (really) 158 dice! Epic!

One small gripe I have about the game is the way the ASW / Flak / Sub warfare plays out. I found it was easy for both sides to ignore flak development, for instance. And even maxing out the ASW assets never really took out the German u-boat threat. With more experience and better play, I may find those mechanics more effective and realistic, but in our game only the sub warfare mattered. Even with that gripe, I like the way the game represents those parts of combat. I just didn't get the feel they were as well integrated to the whole as I'd have liked.

All in all, this game deserves more play, for sure.

Update: I've played this game now 4 times, twice by email, three times as axis. I got pounded badly in the two PBEM games, but it was still fun. I wish it wasn't such a massive time investment, I'd love to play more and try to actually play well as axis. With Sturm Europa on the horizon, I'm not sure that will happen.

EastFront is the definite WWII game for me, but Europe Engulfed comes pretty close. Special Actions control the flow of the game without too much rules. Unfortunately, the political rules are quite complicated and takes some time to get them right. Worth the effort however.

[Wargame, Block game, WWII] Played a bit, but I'm nowhere near formulating a rating for EE. Seems to be simpler than a straight-through reading of the rulebook would indicate. Special actions are scarce, expensive and pivotal all at the same time. Expect a rating in, I dunno, 2006? After a few more goes at it, will try to give an impression from a German gamer's perspective. EE is intimidating, and like most "true wargames" is prone to exceptionitis, but I don't currently feel that it's completely inaccessible to a person that can process a game like Puerto Rico or Java.

Simply gorgeous production and epic game play.  An Axis and Allies for a serious wargamer.  The game really hts the spot for me.  It abstracts everything that I would abstract about WWII and doesn't sacrifice any of the big picture view of how the war in Europe was waged.  I wish I had more time to pull this out to explore all of the nuance.

Looks beautiful set up- but never actually played yet. Overwhelming - probably too much for me these days, since it's very difficult to find friends willing to invest the time (most would rather play A&A)

Update: Sold. Just don't have time for these long games anymore,  particularly since it's essentially a simulation.  Triumph & Tragedy will easily take EE's place. Far more reasonable and quicker to access. If I'm looking for something like this, it's easy to fall back onto A&A 1940- pretty much the same thing, really.

For those of us who grew up on Axis & Allies for war games, this game is a great improvement.  Lots of good detail without getting into minute nuiasences.  A great wargame with lots of options but still holds onto historical possiblities.

Dear boardgamers-
This game is outstanding. If you like wargames, with lots of strategies, yet not too complex, then this is the right game for you. It has a great mixture of features, all merged in a cool concept.

It makes really fun! I played it with 3 friends and though the game obviously wasn't designed for 4 players it was well playable.
Very good appearence, you feel the hearts the designers put into it.

My reference!

Just too much accounting and not enough decision making.  I'm more of a tactical-thinking person so I enjoy Barbarossa to Berlin much more.  (Tactical as opposed to strategical, but I'm not talking about the scale of the game, I'm talking about the decision-making needed.)

RATING: 5
Engulfed in dice rolling! Clearly the use of blocks doesn't fit this design, here's IMO why:

-  when many units are involved in battle, resolution requires rolling a ton of dice and takes way too much time! A CRT would grant the same outcome without wearing everybody out!

- fog of war is almost negligible.

Over all an irrational and almost unplayable package, which will require the same amount of time as World in Flames while functioning at a much higher level of abstraction! I love block wargames but I learned that the max number of units on the board at any time should rarely exceed 100.

At first this seemed very scripted but there is still tons of meaningful decisions to make so perhaps it is an illusion (or the other way around). I think it's very good, but have to play more to be sure (will be a problem because of the length)

RATING: 7.5
I like the mechanism, but the game length is long for a "light" game (still that is to be expected with the european theatre).  Scripted rules to lock step the game into historical play make this is a bit dry (ie. 1939-1941 game is predictable and little variation of tactics is possible).  That portion gives it a A&A feel.  Take Poland, build lots of units and then smash Belgium and the Maginot...Blocks are small and topple over easily.  UGHHHH
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Experienced wargamers will find this a snap, and Axis & Allies players should be able to make the leap with just a little bit of effort. The mechanics are familiar and transparent enough that you'll be fighting the war (rather than fighting the rules) after just a couple learning turns -- a real winner. Expect a long game, though ... short of a 1941 game that ends in 1944, I can't imagine completing this game in less than a weekend.

And not to forget - a beautiful gameboard/map. Just looks great. Just makes me want to play it. Now!

RATING: 8
A very nice system indeed, with lots of beautifully integrating and well designed subsystems like Strategic Warfare and Collapse of Italian morale. I especially enjoy the fact that the latter forces the Axis to hang onto North Africa, something which I haven´t seen done right in any other Grand Strategic WW2 game.

Simply a brilliant game, resembles a much smoothened out Third Reich.

Extremely hard to get on the table, however: takes up a huge space and goes on for a respectable amount of hours. My friend owns the game but out of sheer spatio-temporal difficulties we don´t play it nearly as often as we´d like.

Update 2010: Recent games have unfortunately shown a tendency of the Russian Front to stagnate to a staring match between two huge block stacks instead of a fluid "front in motion". Need to play more to see if we discover a counter to this tendency. Still a good game, though, I would probably never turn down a chance to play.

Played about half a game solo of the 41 scenario to get a feel for it.  Played a few turns of the 39 scenario too.  The special actions let you do some interesting stuff but they aren't getting me as excited as I thought they would.  Still, this is probably the best of the Axis and Allies family of grand multi-front WWII games.  A very good wargame with simple systems and realistic political chrome, but overall leaves me wanting something a little more meaty.  Score might improve once I play FtF.

Good: Grand Strategic - WWII ETO - Medium

This game makes Axis & Allies obsolete thanks to the special actions.

Plus:
-Compact ETO game that covers the whole ETO
-Special Actions are a brilliant innovation
-Clear rules
-Great online support
-Eventhough it is quite a long game, it plays quick.

Down:
-Components are so so
-Tends to be too scripted, which is good from historical perspective but at the same time very limited 'what if' scenario's. Seeloewe is not an option and a German victory in the dessert is hollow as it only reduces your strength on the Eastern Front.   
However, there are many exciting moments but make it through to 1946 is the name of the game.
-Why do not all individual areas not have economical value? This encourages to attack certain arreas.
-Display of the General track record is blend and a chit for bombers / submarines warfare does not represent the impact of it on the game imo

Some really briljant concepts but I prefer EuroFrontII over this as the latter the ultimate 'what if' scenario's .
   
Special Actions are brilliant system. So simpel yet so many options. These Special Actions killed Axis & Allies for me and this feature makes me never to play Axis & Allies again (with all respect for A&A though).
On the down, there are less strategic / political options as I hoped for: example that Turkey joins Axis if ME is conquerred or that Spain gets involved too when Axis dominate the Meditterean.
All comes down to a battle in Russia, as in history. Anyhow, would have loved a third way to victory Germany other than Seeloewe and Barbarossa.
Attack the USSR early and game over for the Allies.

This title is the World War 2 battle for Europe in a large scale block game. I really like this system and although the rule set can be intimidating it is really good.

RATING: 4
A 4 means "could be talked into it on occasion". I've played this once (3-player) and am willing to give it another go before solidifying my opinion.

Everyone says the Special Actions are a brilliant idea and that is true.

For the most part we all liked the level of abstraction this provided.

Here's my list of complaints while they are fresh in my head:

- No way to keep track of WERPs. This makes Production tedious and error prone. (All the units in Western Europe meant we often overlooked the WERPs for the Netherlands and Belgium.) Simply ridiculous that there is no solution for this in the game but they included a sixth German Special Action chit, just in case you are playing with the optional rule that lets the German have a 6th Special Action once per game.

- Many areas on the board were too small for the stacks that were fighting there.

- Rolling 50+ dice got tedious. Next time we vowed to use the CRT (or at least some kind of iPhone/Android dice roller). Production + all this dice rolling account for the largest chunk of the game time and both feel like something that could be streamlined.

- Not having a weather/terrain effects chart on the board resulted in constant "what does mud do again? And light mud?" every turn as everyone tries to decide what to plan.

- Lots of special cases that railroad the game into historical determinism. In our game Germany was collapsing but Italy was still virtually unscathed. The German player wanted to move an Italian unit up north one province to help stop the Western Allies. "Nope, not allowed in the rules. Just because." "Can't declare war on Vichy until some Magic Date. Just because." "British bombers suddenly become better (even though the player never spent any points on them in the actual game). Just because." Of course the problem is how do to solve those problems (given the current Europe Engulfed framework) without adding rules complexity and play length?

Overall, I'm not sold on the length of the game warranting what I get out of it. (I'm not certain that the extra depth over Axis & Allies is warranted by the longer playing time.) That's a bit of a snap judgment (since it is based on a single play) and probably aficionados will tell me how wrong I am. The problem is, with a game that takes 12+ hours how many plays do I need before that depth becomes apparent? How often can I arrange an entire game for ETO gaming?

(It probably doesn't help that I'm increasingly convinced that WW2 ETO is a terrible choice for a gaming subject, no matter how brilliant the designer. Maybe Bowen Simmon's Stavka will change my mind?)

I enjoyed the game although we were playing a few of the rules wrong. 

But it came off badly compared to the card driven games. 

Lots of chrome rules which while not bad made it a rather slow first game. 

While I enjoyed it and would play again I doubt it will be played ahead of Barbarossa to Berlin or Paths of Glory when we want a heavyish two player war game. It's three player possibilities will probably give it another chance though.

I've got three games in, and so far this has become my new #1 game.  I'll refrain from rating a 10 before getting a few more games under my belt, but so far this game is beautiful.  Nice mechanics, rules are a good complexity, time frame is long, but managable, components are nice.  The parts of the war seem almost like chapters in a book.  As they play out and new conflicts begin, you just want to keep going and find out what happens next.  I can't wait to see more about Asia Engulfed, and the new FAB series.

Only played a couple of imcompleted games (a few turns each time) plus a full Blockskrieg game. Europe Engulfed seems to be an excellent strategic-level game.

The simplified Blockskrieg version is actually well worth playing - the full war can be completed in the same time as a short scenario with the full set of rules.

Wowsa.  This game is a monster... huge map, a zillion pieces, TONS going on.  It took us quite a while to get setup and rolling the first time, but once we did things became much clearer.  I'm sure we missed some political rules in there, but the overall gameplay mechanics simply work very well.  This game is no light undertaking... even the tournament scenario will require at least 5 hours imo (including setup/breakdown)... Regardless, GMT has crafted a really nice 'huge' wargame.  

After a couple more plays this is one of my 10's.  I just LOVE it.  As an old Axis n Allies player, this is AnA on steroids.  I'm waiting anxiously for the Pacific version...

Overall an excellent light strategic-level ETO game. My only gripes are that the strategic air-war with fighters and bombers is too abstract and it does not seem worth it to build them, and that u-boat strategy is a non-decision; Germany builds as many u-boats as possible per turn until they start losing the sub war, and then they build none.

This game is exactly what it looks like: an unmerciful, brutal, ponderous simulation of the European theater in World War II. It relies heavily on dice, every rule seems to have an exception, and it railroads you at nearly every step.

But it's a LOT of fun. There are a few things that make this game miles ahead of a game like Axis & Allies. One is the victory condition. Since Germany is virtually guaranteed to fail to take Moscow and London, it only has to survive to 1945 to win. The game is one of slow attrition, of money and soldiers both. The Soviets stand off to one side while France gets obliterated, accumulating infantry and a little armor. (After it actually enters the war, it becomes MUCH more powerful.) France provides a perhaps unrealistically stout defense to the German invasion. Britain has a powerful fleet; unfortunately, its economy is open to being destroyed by German subs. (I still await a a WWII sim with viable naval AND ground-based rules - those here are a bit abstract, and don't reflect the dangers that U-boats posed to soldiers and not just, say, grain shipments from America.)

Once America enters the war, which only happens rather late, it becomes incumbent upon the Germans to stage a careful retreat. It only has to own a couple territories past the end of the actual war to win. I suspect that the Allies win the game most of the time, but since you don't have to actually hang onto the Axis's opponents' capitals, it's not impossible.

Altogether, a great game. It does take an unbelievably long time, but personally, I think it's worth it to have the more granular system than A&A provides.

This was a disappointment. The game's core mechanisms are quite elegant and simple, but there are just too many exceptions and restrictions, especially in the first few years. Operationally there is not much going on: large amounts of blocks are fighting eachother over relatively few areas. And then there is the playing time which is seriously out of control.
On a positive note, special actions are a stroke of genius.

There are some good ideas in this game, especially the use of the special actions for breakthroughs, retreat before combat, reinforcing combat and the other actions they allow.  However, this game takes too long to play.  With the basic rules, you're looking at two whole days of gaming.

The rules for handling the constraints on each power and the limitations on when you can attack or purchase certain units are very difficult to remember.  Given that in EE the players are essentially making the same decisions as you would in Axis & Allies (what units to buy, where to deploy them and what attacks to make), a game that can be played in half the time and includes the Pacific Theater, I prefer the game that can be finished in one sitting, Axis and Allies.  The "6 to hit" system, while okay in a smaller game with simple rules, doesn't fit with the more complex rules in this game.  

It's very frustrating to see a well planned strategy go off the rails with some of the extreme results that can occur with this combat system.

The excellent iEE program handles rule enforcement (there are so many exceptions and specific rules that I have to wonder how many people can play through it correctly the first few times) and it also takes care of the buckets of dice and all of the chores.    Exceptional designer support.  I'm not much into strategic or (apparently) block games, but this one is fun and the best block game I've played.  Scripted yet retaining lots of options,  I'm looking forward to more.

Deserves to be one of the more popular wargames.

EE is a beast to learn.  There are exceptions abound, which you must know to use to your advantage.  Often playing this game felt like attempting to steer the Titantic away from the ice berg, just slow and cumbersome.  There's a lot of down time in this game, and I would often get up and take a break while my opponent made considerations.

I appreciate how this game has so much depth, but is handled at a high level (uboats,bombers).You can attack your opponent directly by moving into a controlled area and indirectly by cutting off their supply (if you don't pay attention to your supply line, getting back in supply can be tough) or bombing/uboating to damage production.  Then there's weather, which totally changes your strategy upon changing of seasons.

What keeps this from being perfect for me is length as the game has to stay out for several sessions and requires a HUGE table.  You also have to constantly refer to the Rule Book and Play Book and I gurantee you'll miss an exception which makes me feel like I cheated.

Another aspect that really annoyed me was the bigger your army, the more dice you had to roll, I often rolled 50+ dice!  It's not the luck aspect (since it balances out over the 12 hours of play) but the time spent rolling that annoys.  But I found out there was a solution that you can consult a chart and roll just a handful to represent the larger number.  My remedy was creating a random number generator on my TI Graphing Calculator (just scroll down the EE page and you'll see it in the user posting part).  It streamlines the game tremendously and I highly recommend it.  I still roll dice by hand for the smaller rolls.

I sold my copy to one of the co-players because I know I will never have the space or time to play with anyone else.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a mediocre game, it's just not my cup of tea.

Got this for myself for christmas '05. Turned out to live up to all the hype (including the amount of exceptions/special cases. Nothing you won't weather if you have played A3R and/or WIF in the past; having the rule book at hand for the first few games is necessary).

It also looks likely to work well with three players, in which it joins Breakout: Normandy and a select few other wargames. UPDATE: It does. Great w/three!

I see this being played a lot in the future!

Seems to be a good game that I would be willing to play with a knowledgeable player who knows the rules.

I like the basic mechanics of this game quite a bit.  The length is going to prevent it from hitting the table as often as it should.  Also the rules are exception-ridden and probably a bit too complicated for my taste.

RATING: 4
Good gaming topic and concept.  But the wooden pieces deter me from approaching it.  The final map just throws me back to those S&T years back then under 3W...I am worried about the hype around all this game.  Even the streamlined version "Blockskerig" rules as it stands now is fairly complex and cannot be taught to kids under 2 hours.  The game system covers operational and strategic movement, initial combat and special types of combats (e.g. amphibious landing assault or airbone attack) carried out by the use of special action points in a standard I-go-u-go fashion.  This makes the game long and dull as little and no interaction between Allied and Axis during other sides' phases. Production is handled by WERP ("War Effort Resources Points"), something similar to Third Reich's BRP ("Building Resources Points") whereby players spend them to build up new units and purchase replacements.  Naval action is completely left out in Blockskerig version but I doubt the full version can handle it completely afresh.  Victory in a campaign game can only be determined by the end of 1945 to see how long the Reich could survive. At a strategic level game like this, it could have been much more tense if a year by year victory conditions could be phased in (like something in the Russian Campaign).  Overall, a game which lacks colours and flavours.  It does not add motives for players to do things aggressively, other than repeating what we had known about the history. The political considerations also scripted the game to a historical line where a nation cannot declare a war before a certain date.  The designer seems to throw in a mix of herbs from the games like Third Reich's ambition, Columbia's blocks, Axis and Allies' dice-rolling and area movement, TSR's Europe Aflame's scale flavour, and boiling them all over in one pot again.  The final taste is a rather disappointment from GMT recently, considered the rather well-received card driven series games.  Check out similar game from Neppa: European Theatre of Operations (no, it ain't from TSR or Decision Games) or the PC game "Hearts of Iron" for game on the similar scale and play.

The game is pretty complicated but is a lot of fun and huge in scale.  The special actions are a great feature, and create a lot of flexibility while also imposing limits.

Ok, I would like to like that one, I like the blocks and the map.

But once you come to the Russian campaign and you see that best tactics are to keep a single unit to defend most of the areas, it becomes rather unrealistic !

So I wait that my son has the age to be bored from Risk (he doesn't play Risk yet) to get a chance to play again.

RATING: N/A
[Never completed a play - one aborted attempt]

An example of why I usually dislike wargames: a lot of complexity due to rules you are going to use once per game and exceptions to those rules and an overall lenght that I could spend playing a dozen of games I like instead of a single play of this one. The "payoff" of this complexity is nor even close to "acceptable".
Besides, gameplay is resolved rolling an avalanche of dice.

While I don't like wargames, you could convince me to play "Hannibal" or "Hammer of the Scots", but I won't try this monstrosity again.


Note: my rating would be a "2" (based of my desire to try EE again), but I've removed it as I'm uncomfortable with the idea of rating the game without completing a play (even if I know that I'll probably  never try again).

RATING: 5
I don't really know what it is. But I do not seem to be able to like this game. The concept is great, the components are great, but... I can not seem to grasp the 'fun factor' in this game. Maybe it's the blocks that disturb me, or maybe I am remembering that time when I lost Malta to a sick sick sick streak of unlucky dice rolls, I do not know. I probably should say that I enjoy games like WiF and the 'Struggle for Europe' series from Coat of Arms, so I might not be the person with the right inclination to like this game. I want slightly more advanced games when playing on this strategic level. I am currently considering to sell my copy.

For me, this really hits the sweet spot for strategic-level wargaming.  Yes, the game is going to take more than one sitting to complete; and, yes, there are a lot of rules and exceptions to those rules.  If those are concerns for you then gaming WWII from '39 to '45 is just not something you should be doing.

If gaming the entire WWII European theatre IS something you should be doing, I highly recommend this game.

Most strategic WW2 games I've tried have been disappointing - over-long and over-complex and liable to reward strategies which would have been historically impossible.  Europe Engulfed, however, abstracts in all the right places (air, naval, strategic warfare) has very clever rules to make the Mediterranean campaign work and generally unfolds as a plausible narrative.  Very well supported by the designers.

Exciting and a long wargame. Rules dictate too much what you will do in this game. So Germany always takes Poland, Benelux-countries, France, Jugoslavia and Greece in this order. That means there isn't too much strategic variability before -41. That's when you finally have to make some strategic decisions in Eastfront (go after Moscow or Baku etc.). I recommend new players don't start this game from scenario -39 (as we did) as the game is at its best after the Eastern Front campaign starts.

I love this game. It was my first block game (I have since bought a couple from Columbia) and it is in my view "just right" in terms of complexity - not challenging for an experienced gamer, but with enough chrome and optional rules to keep it interesting for many replayings. It is a historically realistic game of WWII but allows a wide range of options. The mapboard and other components are top-notch. Block density has not been a problem for me due to the thoughtfully-provided army markers and with my force pool stored in a plano container. In short, this is one of the best new games I've played in years, and one I'm sure I'll still be playing many years from now.

The gameplay is pretty straight forward. Lots of chrome. Lots of yummy yummy history.

Playing my first game, and while it is surely a "design for effect" style, it seems to get the big picture right. Concerned however about some of the "steamroller" tactics with unlimited stacking.

EE is maybe a bit too much like A&A on steroids.

Caveat: My rating is based on only one play.  It is a cool game, but not nearly deep enough.  It is a _long_ game, so you better have dedicated players.

Ok, now after a few more times, I have to say that it is really impressive and I was wrong to say it's not deep.  There are many options available and what I was doing incorrectly was rushing (as the Allies), which is a big mistake.  Playing Germany is fun, btw.

From it's smoothness and relative quickness of play, constant weight of decision, wide variety of strategical considerations, to the fog of war aspect and large gameboard, this game has it all.  This game is many steps up from 'Axis and Allies' in complexity (much closer to AH's 'Rise and Decline of the Third Reich'), and much more challenging and fun.  I think it plays best as a two-player game, but will certainly work as a 3 player. I look forward to seeing how well it works with Asia Engulfed.
The only weakness the game has - and I really am being picky here - is it's naval battle rules (fleet points are very expensive, and the method of resolving fleet battles can easily result in very lop-sided outcomes), and the large quantity of dice rolled to resolve attacks (...other than naval attacks).  I really like the combat system, but rolling that many dice takes some time, and more importantly allows for a wide distribution of hits.  The 3-dice combat chart included in the game is very nice and does fix the dice quantity problem, but I created my own 3-dice combat chart to eliminate the wide hit distribution problem.  It is the same chart really, I simply pulled in the ends of the bell curve. The naval battle rules are addressed even more easily.

Although it does some things reasonably well, I remain very unconvinced by EE. My main quibbles at this stage, having played it twice, are:

* I am not sure that the blocks bring a great deal to the party.

* There is an awful lot of dice rolling, which similarly seems to add little.

* The strategic warfare feels all wrong. The Germans build masses of subs, which are low cost/high effect, and there is no political or other downside to their doing so. The subs more or less destroy British production in 1940-41 and, I would guess, in 1942 also, since the British can at best advance one ASW step per year whereas sub building is effectively unlimited. And there is a good chance that poor luck will cause the British to miss a step advancement in one or more years. The effect of the subs is that in mid-1941 the Axis are churning out 50+ build points, whereas the British are typically on about 10 points. As a result, the British are hard-pressed to do anything at all, and cannot even afford naval engagements, for the Axis can easily outpace them in naval builds; and building fighters and bombers is an impossible dream. It seems ludicrous that the British should be on 20% of Axis production capability - in reality the subs were a menace but did not have anything like this level of impact, certainly not on military production.

* The desert campaign is very dull, and feels more like the Western Front of WW1 than the actual campaign, as both sides immediately develop trench lines and sit facing each other. 

* The rules are headache-inducing and abysmally organised. This is made worse by the index which is over-concise and incomplete. Trying to find where Bulgarian units may go by looking up Axis minors, say, in the index gives you the choice (from memory) of 3.11, 5.72, 9.11, 9.23, 11.5 and 23.42, with no indication of which rule might be relevant to the point. After a while this becomes maddening.

* It is absolutely pathetic that GMT 1) did not any include any markers for national production; and 2) that the table only runs up to 30, when production levels and strategic warfare markers frequently exceed this number.

I received my copy yesterday (17/12): I can tell you, I am really impressed.  The big box is packed with quality components. The map itself is huge and has a nice & clear layout.  The thick, colourfull (round!) cardboard counters and the wooden blocks really look great.  GMT has done a great job here.  Let's hope gameplay is as good as its looks.  First problem for me will be to find a big enough table to play this game on.

I love this game.  I had grown up with Axis & Allies before moving in euro games.  However I never found another wargame to replace A&A until Europe Engulfed.  The scale, the wooden pieces, the comprehensive rules and excellent game play, its all amazing.

As a longtime World in Flames veteran the relative simplicity of this game was quite welcome.  I really like this game, there are plenty of decisions but the game moves at a good brisk pace.  Plays excellently solo as well as multiplayer. The fog of war created by the blocks really helps playing solitaire IMHO.  It's a pleasure to see wargaming getting away from that 'setting up that perfect 4:1 combat factor attack' mentality.

I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. But it all works fine in this game hence the rating.

Fun, tense, but a bit too scripted (don't deviate from historical plans). Limited intelligence at this level is not realistic and overly favours the defender. To balance this, it seems to me that Axis strength has been exagerated.

Much easier to get on the table than Columbia's "Front" series (anyone ever tried the entire Front Series Campaign game? Yikes!).
  Overall, its better than Axis and Allies ever was, and easier to play than most wargames (About the same difficulty as PoG or BtB).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Truly a great game. The political rules are not difficult, but there is a lot of special conditions and exceptions to remember. If played regularly it is no problem, but it does make it difficult to pick up the game after a long pause.

I love the special action mechanic. It is a great way to simulate the German initiative without inflating the number of German forces. It also makes perfect sense as a limitation on exotic amphibious assaults, which are being conducted all over the place in some other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating is tentative.  A game of this scope takes a lot of time to assess.  That said, I have really enjoyed the game.  Feels like a desparate challenge for both sides - resources are tight.  The game might a little too scripted but I haven't played enough to really say one way or the other - the rules preclude wildly unrealistic possibilities (such as the Axis invading North America) and force a set game plan for the Germans: eliminate Poland, then France, then move on to Russia, or possibly an invasion of Britain.  Some will appreciate the adherence to history, others wont.   There are several conditional rules, also a turn off for those who don't like complexity.

My only concern is the replayability: will this essentially be the same game every time?

I like this best of all the strategic WWII games I've played (3R, BtB, EA, TK, EF).  Lot's of compromises to keep it fast(er), and while other may object to buckets of dice I rather enjoy it.  The really needs a political/diplomatic element - unrestricted by political meddling the Germans are really nasty and I can see why they win a lot of automantic victories.  The allies have to be patient and Russians stoic in the face of disaster after disaster.  Yes, it;'s big and long but it doesn't pretent it's not, either.

Beautiful, deep, tricky, and real.  The first couple turns are tricky, trying to place all of the rules in there proper slot in your head, but after that, the game takes on a very simple, elegant playability, and so accurately models history it is somewhat frightening.  Nice game, but a bit slow.

This game looks beautiful. Very high quality components. The Playbook is a real treasure trove, with optional rules, example game, strategy notes, suggested deployments, etc. I have played the 1942 tournament scenario a few times and the 1941 campaign game twice. This game is great fun, intense, absorbing, and historically convincing. A bargain considering the amount of fun this has given me. Only reason it's not a 10 for me is the time and table space required to play.

Could be great if I had the time to play it.  The rules were supposed to be simple, and they are, but then every rule seems to have at least twelve exceptions - which then makes it a complex game and "way too complex".  If it was my only game - great.  I could learn it all and play quickly - but it ain't!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game has nice components, good rules (although a bit massive), good ideas. Problem for me was that this is a LONG game that is influenced a lot by tiny chancy things like the submarine warfare (here a few dice have heavy impact), and that in some instances there are HUGE battles that require a bucketful of dice to be rolled, and when that bucket turns sour the first time it is rolled the outcome can quickly tilt from "I will most certainly win" to "almost no chance". This is a problem inherent with block games, but when playing Julius Caesar or Hammer of the Scots or a similar game the damage is limited as you have not invested hour after hour and just start a new one. 

But I think if one has the chance to play it one shouldn't let slip it, because the game has its merits!

Jesse and I designed the game we most wanted to play. Even after more than 300 games played, I'm always happy to play this game. Most of my plays these days are done using the www.wargameroom.com interface, which I highly recommend! 

I am very happy with GMT's obvious desire for quality. The 4-panel 24 pt. Cardstock maps alone (thicker coardboard mounting than Columbia, and Columbia uses 8-panel folding for their 34" x 22" maps) speak volumes about the quality GMT has infused into this game. The counters are beautiful.  I am one VERY happy designer with my publisher's care and effort.

EE plays fast, with its focus on playability and making the players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under.

Solange die Regeln von "Victory in Europe" nicht grundlegend überarbeitet werden, ist dies für mich DAS Block-Game zum ETO (wenngleich mit eingeschränktem Simulationswert). Seine Regeln sind zwar nicht unmittelbar eingängig, aber konsistent und nach zwei- bis dreimaliger Lektüre nachvollziehbar. Die abstrakte Einbeziehung des in Europa prinzipiell nachrangigen Seekrieges erlaubt die Konzentration auf das Wesentliche. Die "Special Actions" sind ein Geniestreich.
Und: Im Gegensatz zu "Victory in Europe" ist die Karte und sind die einzelnen "Areas" groß genug für viele Blöcke.

really great world war two strategic level game. I have played WiF a lot as well as a few other strategic level WWII games. This game is very very fast compared to the other games. The rules are straightformward, clean and elegant. There are barely any special rules compared to other games dealing with strategic level WWII. I have played several times and each time WWII has come out about right with events happenning when they should ! This is amazing with such a simple and fun game. I am impressed. This is a land game so air and naval rules are simplified. The naval rules are what I would call absurdly simple yet they work. My only complaint is that places that you can do amphibious invasions are not that numerous and the political restrictions are a little too reswtrictive. This limits a little what can be done. But still there are many options and the game plays pretty darn fast. The special actions work pretty well and Germany getting a lot of them early in the war is the main thing that makes Germany strong offensively. Other countries getting few of them early in the war keeps the game moving fast. In 1941 Germany can get to its historical limit in Russia but not much further (the game is well balanced for Barbarossa). But the Germans can concentrate on and capture Moscow, Leningrad or the south but must settle for less than historical in other areas of Russia/north africa. In 1943 and early 1944 a stalemate always seems to devellop which makes the allies feel that they can never reconquer Europe. Then magically the allies (russia in particular) start advancing and in 1945 become unstoppable. Like I said above, the events of the war come out about right. There is room for trying alternate history(the game is not as scripted as some card driven games). Great game ! a 10!

Europe Engulfed is not a bad game by itself, however it has flaws in the endgame (high stacking of blocks) and a high focus on minor very specific rules (e.g. in the Mediterranean area). The design is good but the functionality does not match with the rules.
Also after playing more then 5 games, the allied/soviet power is too strong in comperison to the axis. A defence position for the soviets until the British/Americans land in France always stopped the Germans in a few turns.

This is a decent strategic game, it's only downside it being a little too scripted in the beginning of the war. The game play overall is pretty simple (for a consim), but the political rules are really a little too much. They are generally a bunch of exceptions to rules or restrictions for the players and can easily be overseen in play, because they are so many and it's hard to remember all in play. This pretty much shadows the enjoyment you can get from the game. For beginners I recommend to start the campaign in 1941.

Strips out all the irrelevant details and still conveys all the nitty gritty of ww2, with heaps of flavour. Not grand enough to me with respect to some other ww2 strategic big wigs. Playing Asia Engulfed alongside might make me change my mind about this though.

RATING: 7
A placid casual block game.  Light enough to chat up each other while playing it.  There is quite a bit to do each turn, but once you get the game going, you can take a relaxed look at whatever you need to do and see what can get done. 

If you want tense WWII block action you want Eastfront, if want to leisurely observe a sweeping overview of the war, then this is a lovely experience.

This is just a fantastic WWII game! Feels very historical without being too forced and the special actions gives lots of very cool strategic/tactical possibilities. The blocks and the board are beautiful and functional. And for my part it is great that its not too rules heavy :O)

This is a game that will suit certain players and not others.  It is very scripted, and follows (I believe) a very historical time-line.  Some players will love this and be comfortable with it, and others will struggle with this aspect.  This is one game I recommend playing first with someone who knows it well, before buying.

It feels a little like Axis and Allies reimagined with Hammer of the Scots mechanisms. The core of the game is simple, but all the effects, modifiers and the turn-based historical restraints add a lot to remember and track. The commitment to major historical points can feel confining and the rules exceptions are numerous, but the game is manageable. You throw several cubic tons of dice, but that doesn't negate the strategy. Components are decent; map and labels are clean, neat and legible.

Terrific game.  I've only played the eastern front tourney scenario (many times now) and recommend the game solely on that basis!  I'd love to get in a campaign but haven't been able line up the time/opponent.

RATING: 9
Having now played Eastfront, which I understand was the inspiration for Europe Engulfed, I find that I enjoy Eastfront more.  Don't get me wrong; I still love Europe Engulfed and will gladly play it.  But Eastfront is one degree more detailed, and I think that's what I usually want.  Of course, if I want the whole European Theater experience, I'll probably still pick EE (Eurofront is a long endeavor).

Simply the best strategic level WWII game for the European Theater currently out there.  Not too difficult to get into, yet has enough details to keep you interested and coming back, with the emphasis on strategy and game play instead of fussing over too many rules.

Well it was interesting,  but it's a touch too complex to bring to the table without a careful review of the rules by both players.  Which means this game simply can't find any table time AROUND HERE.  Despite that, I respect the design and the work it took to make this masterpiece of a game.

I've gotten about... 70-75 hours of play out of this so far. Granted, that's only six or so full games, but that's okay. I can't think of many games that I have or would WANT to play for so many hours. 

Although I suspect this game can only be played so many times before losing its novelty, I have yet to reach that point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I haven't played this more than a half dozen or so times, but that equates to about 100-120 hours. The game is a bit railroad-y insofar as you're going to follow historical options fairly closely. 

That being said, while your freedom is limited in the larger scheme of things, and you can't devote resources to political goals like getting the USA into the war sooner or having the USSR attack Germany, you have a fairly large amount of leeway on a smaller scale. You get a lot of freedom to invade Russia how you like, and you can launch D-Day anywhere there's a beach for you. 

In addition, both players will get a fair amount of time to be on the offensive, with Germany getting their doomed invasion of Russia for 2-3 years before Russia turns the tide. 

I have only 2 quibbles. First, fairly important events can hinge on single die rolls--weather and U-Boat attack damage, for example. Second, I've never really seen the aerial Battle of Britain pay off for Germany. If Germany invests heavily into U-Boats, Britain is going to be starved enough economically that the lack of aerial bombing will be a drop in the bucket. I've played this game as Britain/US, Germany and Russia now, and I have yet to see Germany invest in bombing unless they literally have no other spending options left.

I highly recommend starting with the 1941 invasion of the USSR. The 1939 scenario is basically Germany kicking ass on their own for 4+ hours. The Allies could probably start and finish their own separate game night before needing to make any decisions.

Wow!  If you like Columbia Block Games, if you like Avalon Hill's Third Reich, you will love this one.  It takes the basic ideas behind Columbia's games, adds in the grand strategic drama of TR (and a bunch of the little fiddly rules that make the various countries act historically), and gives it all to you in a package with a huge map and several fistfuls of brightly colored blocks and cardboard chits.  Don't plan on casually playing this in a short evening.  Plan for at least one meal break in the middle of the war, and at least one sleeping session as well, if you play the whole war.  Is it worth it?  Oh, yeah.  And now I'm looking forward to it sister, Asia Engulfed.

If you play it in public, expect lots of people to rubberneck, and expect comments like, "Is that like Super Risk?" and, "Is that like Axis and Allies but bigger?"

RATING: 4
Good but not great game.  The block concept never quite delivers on the steppes of Russia.  Though deception and strategic reserves SHOULD be important, they really aren't as the concentration of forces in way too few areas takes any fog of war right out of the game.  East Front does a far better job. Does a good job of modeling the attritional apsects of the war though.  In some ways its accuracy is so good at showing the futility of the Axis position that it saps some of the fun out of the game (as I am sure 1944 sapped the "fun" out of the war for the real Axis).

Jeu agréable avec beaucoup de possibilités et un vrai traitement stratégique (y compris un système économique simplifié et une prise en compte des éléments aériens et navals). Les actions spéciales sont une très bonne idée.

Le jeu est cependant trop long (plus de 30 heures pour ma première partie) et devoir lancer plus de 50 dés devient lassant à force (je compte d'ailleurs utiliser la table 3D6 pour les parties suivantes).

RATING: 10
This is the very best Strategic European WWII game - Totaler Krieg is very good but it takes so long to play and is complex.  This is very easy to play in comparison, captures all the elements you would want in a strategic game and is the business.

I lot is said of the fog of war - don't let this put you off if you want to play solitaire. I've played both FtF and solitaire and the Fog of War can be ignored with very little reduction in play value. Its the strategic decisions which are important not 'is that a pile of full strength armour or not'.

Buy this game whilst you can - once it's out of stock people will kick themselves and complain about the price it commands on ebay.

UPDATE : I will probably continue playing this game (by e-mail only) but after playing FtF I must confess I was rather disappointed. EE doesn't reach the standards I expected at first sight.
The problems I encountered are numerous but the main one is the length of the game compared to what it achieves. All games look quite similar & options are very restricted. The Igo-Ugo sequence makes things very long for the inactive player especially for the Allies during 1939-1941/2. You throw LOTS of dice even when using the CRTs.
It was love at first sight with this game but in retrospect it was more a passionate affair than a long-term one.


This game is one of the best I tried recently. Combination of blocks + production management + special actions + elegant system = a real winner !
At first I'm was not really interested in the game (another WW2 strategy game ? ) but I've completely changed my mind. This one will stay for long on my PBEM list & is a future classic for sure.

This game is a terrific blend of many game concepts I like.  Blocks for fog of war.  Area movement so it FEELS like a strategy game.  Enough meat to keep players of more complex games like Advanced Third Reich happy, but not too much to drive Axis & Allies players away.  I've only played with one guy that didn't care for it, but a dozen others love it!  The play time is probably about 12-14 hours once you know the game, so it can be finished in a day.  Try this game out if you haven't.  I got it at Boulder for $63, which is an outstanding value for all the beautiful components.  Since it came out about three months ago, I have not played another game besides this one...it is that captivating!  Easily one of the best wargames I've played.

Whilst this is an excellent WW2 ETO game, I find it railroads you into a historical path a little too much. Sealion is at best a huge gamble, at worst suicide, and there's no flexibility for the allies. Finland, Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria all automatically join the Axis for no apparent reason. The gameplay is great though, and it's much quicker than my favourite WW2 ETO game (TK!).

I fell in love with the pictures of all those blocks on that pretty map. It took over a year to get it to the table.
First a 'short' session was played, which made me really excited about the epic scale of this game. Now I'm in the middle of the 1941 campaign (Axis, hopefully heading for a minor victory). Ten hours so far, about eight to go...

I gave this one a try when I wanted to try some heavier wargames.  At this point, I can say that it was a significant step in my transformation into a wargamer. I am very, very pleased that I made the jump.  The flow of the game is superb.  Really neat as a study of European history, politics and warfare, and how they evolved during WWII.  The mechanics are intuitive, phenomenally so, but I've still found that it takes a very long time to play, especially for gamers who haven't quite had the varied experience with terrain, weather, supply, and other rules that many grizzled wargamers have.  The political rules make the game a little trickier, but not unapproachable, and almost all of them are worth the added complexity, in my mind.  Not something to tackle lightly, but if you have the time and motivation for something like this, it's definitely worth it.

I'm probably crazy, but I don't get what people see in this; my two initial forays were underwhelming, and at this length and ramp-up it won't see another. It feels entirely a game of logistics, with no sense of maneuver or tactics (I'd much prefer if there were twice as many areas, or more).  The political rules are messy (of course), and the rules overall seem disjointed and unfriendly (and I'm comfortable with complex games). The decisions feel very incremental and lack tension...I'm sure I'm missing something, but it just failed for me.

The preceding is especially true in comparison with EastFront, which packs much more punch in terms of operational choices, tactics, bluff, logistics, forward planning, feel for the campaign, turn angst, and inventive mechanisms. Of course they're not directly comparable, and I haven't played WestFront/EuroFront, but I feel like EE is torn between wanting to be a playable A&A sort of thing, or a "real" wargame like EF, and ends up muddled.

I love Axis and Allies, but was looking for something with a little more depth.  Many say that EE is a step up from Axis and Allies and I have to agree. The rules aren't complicated overall, the only thing that gets in the way is the exceptions to the rules.  They take a little while to get down, but once you do, man is this game a blast.  Overall the layers added to this game make it a nice step up from Axis and Allies.

I love this game! I think I've given it a very conservative rating after 2 plays (both games being the '42 scenario). but I can see that many plays are required to become fluent with the rules and to speed up game play...now if this isn't a problem to you, and you know similar like minded players, then strap yourself in for a great game which certainly will be a classic in the near future.

An interesting take on the WWII European strategy game.  I like it pretty well, but it's longer than I prefer.

Best game on the ETO, without allowing for any political flexibility, in my opinion. It combines both history and playability. I like the way the rules are layered on so that the players can decide how much 'chrome' they want.

On the plus side, the game really represents the subject matter well. Play time was MUCH too long for me (somewhere between 12 and 15 hours spread over a few days for the SHORT version). It became Tedium Incarnate. Part of that was a too-deliberate opponent, but still...The real killer for me came in our final session when all those hours of play culminated in nothing more than a Huge Dicefest. Not much of a payoff for the time invested. If you can handle LONG games, give it a go. Just not for me. Sold it on eBay.

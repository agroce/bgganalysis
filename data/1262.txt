I like the smaller more focused theme as compared to the grand original game (A&A). Play balance is iffy and the rules (victory conditions especially) were rough in the beginning (still waiting on version 2.0 rules). No denying that it's truly beautiful after setup.

The best of the A@A spinoffs, I like the way this one plays.  Has an historical sense of inevitability unless the Japanese player is very skilled and creative.

RATING: 6
Best A&A game I have come across because it creates very realistic goals.  Adding the Japanese VP meter makes for a realistic strategy and tense game play.  The convoys are a nice touch.  And the plastic looks great!

I thought this would be the game that might get me into A&A, but at the end, I just don't like that system.

I suppose some people like the challange of facing a 75 dollar per turn US player, but I do not feel that it accuratly shows the attention the US played to the european theatre, and the drain of resources that attention caused. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Giving the Japanese a victory point track makes this a game that can go either way. Obviously the economic power of the Allies will wear the Japanese down so the battle to win and maintain their territories for victory points evens this one out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Capturing India is the easiest route to victory, and makes most of the map unimportant. To fix this, play that Japan can only win by an economic victory, or by taking Australia. I'd rate this a 5+ without that house rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the better A&A games. The map is beautiful (especially compared to the original edition). Additional rules like kamikazes, air bases, and defenders rolling at 1 on Japan's first turn add a lot of flavor and strategic complexity to the game. 

I love having such a detailed map of the Pacific theater, too--it makes the simulation feel much more realistic.

The game balance is not perfect and it has the flaws common to all A&A games (long setup, somewhat repetitive strategies), but it's a great experience overall.

Not sure where to begin commenting on this game. Bought not too long after it came out. Played it a few times but went over like a brick. Even though we play the other variants fairly often.

Something just seemed busted with this one. Never really took the time to figure out what or how to fix it though.

Really need to go back to it and play a few more stock games then look at the variants. Until then it gets a low rating.

Arguably the most tedius part of A&A is the pacific. Its a sinkhole for your money. Again, not bad for a game that makes you think you're employing strategy only to thwart you with bad die rolls. Once again, Yatzee offers the same combat system with much easier setup.

(played a couple of turns as a learning game; since it took 90 minutes, I'm logging it as a game played) I can see how this will be a shorter game (thank goodness) than the regular Axis & Allies; once Japan commits to a course of action, the Allies can decide how to respond. It also looks like every player will have something to do on their turn, harrying outlying Japanese holdings, ferrying people around, sneaking submarines up on each other, and that sort of thing. It's just not the sort of thing I often feel like doing...

Only got to play this once about six years ago, but still have fond memories of the adventure.  Played as Japan, so I decided to strike fast and strike hard.  Thought I had the U.S. on their knees, but the industrial strength of the U.S. eventually overwhelmed me.  Enjoyed all the sea and air battles.  Would like to find a copy available cheap sometime, but am in no rush.

Axis & Allies is a great game, but it just takes waaaayyy too long. Counting income and buying armies is very fiddly. Plane and ship movement will always remain confusing - why can't anyone come up with a more elegant way to move troops around a map? The combat system itself is still one of the best compared to other wargames though!

RATING: 7.9
I love this version of A&A. The largest benefit of it is the victory point system which allows japan to win the war without taking over any capitals. Much more historically accurate, Japan was attempting to win by attrition, not capital control. I love this version of the game! (7 plays)

It's a surprise attack in Pearl Harbour in the beginning of the game. Attack as fast as you can and only centralize your strength to one of pacific fronts, this what Japanese forces player has to do.

Much better than the original game or its Europe-only counterpart.

Allied units rolling a 1 to hit on the first turn is an interesting and highly thematic twist. Japan has a ton of Turn 1 options and can take some pretty dramatic risks. The degree of asymmetry between the two sides is very high (Japan has a vastly better starting position, while the Allies have vastly better long-term economic potential). Japan has a pretty sizable advantage overall, and some IPC or VP bidding is necessary to correct this.

Unlike in most A&A games, the Axis have multiple paths to victory. Japan can either win by taking an Allied capital (usually India, though Australia is vaguely possible) or accumulating VPs (Japan gets 1 VP for every 10 IPCs it collects, and needs 22 to win). So Japan can potentially win by grabbing a lot of rich territory early and then digging in. Even if it's clear that the Allies will conquer Japan eventually, Japan might clear the VP threshhold before that happens. This is a more interesting dynamic, in my opinion, than the typical conquer-everything A&A victory condition.

I think the great emphasis on naval combat (especially battleships!) in this game is a big plus, too. Ships are fun. The air and naval base mechanics do a nice job of making tiny Pacific islands strategically important (as they were in real life).

One irritating tactic in this game is "sub-stalling"--that is, a player clogs up several sea zones with a single sub each. Japan can greatly delay an American invasion with this method, though at the cost of totally ruining the gameplay. Another gameplay issue is that Japan does *not* want to capture either Hawaii or the Chinese IC, both of which can be endlessly and profitably strategic bombed by the Allies. This is very silly. I recommend fixing both of these issues with house rules.

Since this game still suffers from many of the flaws inherent in all Axis and Allies games (see my reviews above), I cannot give it an elite score. It's one of the better games in the series, though.

GOOD:
I love axis & allies, that is why I give this game a 7 when I probably should give it a 6.I still have played the game 15 times though and have had a lot of fun with it. Buy this game if you like Axis & Allies, and/or like miniatures. Game is more historically accurate than most other A & A variants. The first turn with Japans "sneak attack" is great (unless you are the Allies).
BAD:
I like total annihilation games, and this game is just using points to win. Pieces are also too big in my opinion, the board gets cluttered pretty easy. Seems like Japan wins too often and it should be the other way around.

RATING: 5
First few games were a lot of fun, but is was very disappointing to find that just like A&AE, the victory conditions for this game are broken. Probably best to play that VPs are the only way for the Japanese to win.

A&A:P is a tough game to reate because despite the broken VCs I had a lot of fun with the initial exploration of the game. As long as the players constrain themselves by persuing reasonably plausible historical strategies, I think the game is fun. As soon as people start playing to win the game, it crashes and burns. For me, that took about 4 games, but those 4 games were honestly quite fun. But in fairness I still can't give it a good rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
To me, the best Axis and Allies variant.  We use a slightly different setup to achieve balance, without extending the length of the game.  Not too much of a simulation, but a good game.  I like it better than Empire of the Sun.

Given to me by a friend, Pacifica plays very similar to the namesake - Axis and Allies.  The addition of different ships and airplanes adds to the games complexity, but the scale is smaller than the original game which seems to balance out.  Less flaws and more available strategies make this version of the game better than its parent.

The original Axis and Allies was my first "real" game, and it thus retains sentimental value--but "Pacific" is more challenging and satisfying.  Still true enough to the old classic, and easy enough to pick up, but enough changes to keep me interested.

This is a fun game for two or three players.  I usually like games that involve more players.  The fun thing about this game is that you have soooo many units as Japanese, but you have to use them just right!  If you are the Brits, you gotta hold on for dear life.  If you are the US, you need to build a huge invasion fleet and get your marines into Japan as fast as you can!

An interesting adaption of Axis & Allies. One of the few games I've ever won by a single die roll, shooting down an American bomber that had it rolled at all would have denied me (as Japan) my final victory point.  By that point in the game, all the momentum was on America's side.  Whew.  Out of all the Axis & Allies games I've played, it seems the most balanced -- either side can win when players are of equal ability.

Axis and Allies was one of my first wargames (if one can consider A&A a wargame).  Thus, the A&A system has a special place in my heart.  Not terribly realistic, but fun to play, Axis and Allies Pacific is well balanced, comes with really nice pieces and a beautiful mapboard (lots of eye candy here).  One bonus: A&A Pacific can't go on forever because of the Victory Point system.  Sooner or later Japan will either win or lose.  This means that one can play A&A Pacific in a reasonable period of time.

This game is pretty much dominated by naval action: the different naval units, supporting fighters and bombers and "convoy route" rules allow for a wide variety of strategies. The land combat however is pretty bland - fortunately there's plenty of challenge in getting your troops to the right place at the right time. The combat resolution system is simple but cool, making this a pretty abstract and "lightweight" but still quite charming and accessible game.

I'm not a big fan of the original A & A game (I guess it's because I played AH's hex & counter global WWII games--MANY of them!), but this one is, by far, the best!

My favourite at the moment due to least play time with this one and also because of the vast oceans and fleets involved in this game which appeals to me.

More unique strategies, which improve on the other versions. Too bad its for 3 people, and its really hard for Japan really, while Britain doesn't usually do as much as the US. Another dice fest that can kill the game for you, Japan's worst enemy.

RATING: 5
Didn't like the new victory conditions for Japan. I could never make the Allies win since it took so long for the American fleet to build up and get into the fray! Japan would never really "win" either. The game would just "time out" with Japan "winning" without conquering anyone.
Japan's first turn takes way too long...all the allies defend at one on the first turn, and it is ridiculous. My least favorite in the Axis & Allies line.

Can't really play this with more or less than three players, which can be a problem. The outcome is more or less predetermined - but it's all in how long Japan can hold out. The convoy and special marine rules are interesting, but the China/Burma Road meatgrinder gets a bit tiresome for the British player. I like the country specific pieces. Additional plays will help figure out the replayability of this one.

I played it with a variant from Avalon Hill's page to make Japan a little less powerful, and it was ok. Still the quality and amount of components are great...

This game treads down a vastly different strategic path than the original does, while using pretty much the same combat and movement system.  The action is really driven primarily by the Axis player (Japan), while the 2 Allied players (US, Britain) work to catch up to whatever situation the Axis player creates.

This creates the situation of Japan having a lot of stuff to do (and think about) on its turn, and the other countries not so much.  All other things being equal, the Japan player's turn takes a lot longer.  Setting turn time limits can then be used if other things are not equal, like skill or experience, to help level the playing field.  Let the experienced player be Japan, and be pressed for time, while the less experienced players can be the Allies, who won't be as pressed for time since they don't have as much to get done on their turns.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This standalone spin-off from the original Axis & Allies game (released prior to the major revamped and enhanced versions of A&A that have since come out) is in my mind superior to the original A&A.

For starters (and this is a major sell point for me due to the extreme length of other A&A games) the victory conditions introduce an inherent time limit in to the game.  Japan can win by either a) taking and holding an Allied Capitol or b) accumulating 20 Victory Points - which are awarded each turn for every 10 IPCs the Japanese Player earns.  Essentially for the latter victory condition, the Allied Players are on the clock to move quickly against Japan because at minimum the game will last for 20 turns and that's assuming Japan doesn't reach 20 IPCs on a couple of turns..

Also, this game emphasizes Naval units far more than the original A&A - which adds a whole new fun dimension.  Plus, there's also some unique concepts added to the base gameplay system, such Combat Air Patrols, China as semi-separate but US controlled player, and convoys.

Overall, Axis & Allies Pacific improves on the original A&A game while also providing an excellent simulation of the Pacific half of WWII.

My favorite of the Axis and Allies games.  It seems to be the one that provides the most options for all sides, particularly the Axis.  While the first Japanese move can be overwhelming in terms of choices of moves, the wide open spaces and special rules (CAP, convoy zones, etc.) really give it the flavor of the Pacific war.  You can even play it 4-player if you divide up India and Australia!  :)

The best of the A&A games, in part because it was my favourite theatre of the war to read about, in part due to the game play. Only flaw in my mind: the Japanese VP rules. I've been tinkering trying to find a good balance since I started playing.

Is the "India first" strategy dominant?  Seems that way in the two games I've played so far.  

Anyway, a well produced "average game", but way too fiddly.  Also, first Japanese turn can be way too long.  Probably easily fixable regarding VP conditions, but lost interest in the game after second play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My only issues here are with the marines and the CAP rules.  Because of shore bombardment, amphibious assaults in A&A have often been easier than land attacks, and are often used as sleaze tactics, especially in A&AR where the units hit by bombardment can't even fire back (what were they thinking?). In A&AP you have marines, that make amphibious assaults even easier, Argh!  As for CAP, I simply feel that if a fighter is going to forfeit its entire turn to do this, it should be able to guard both the water space and the land zone it came from.  Are you telling me it was in the air over the ocean for several months and missed the whole attack on its land territory?  I think not.  

   The rules for China and the Commonwealth in this game are creative and well done.  Forcing each Commonwealth factory to produce separately is something that should have been done in the rest of the series for all the powers.

Surprised at relatively low rating - it has "innovative" concepts in it for A&A (naval bases and air fields) and offers a lot of "variety" of strategies for both players.  Also "scales" the victory for the Japanese in a way that is compelling. . .

RATING: 8
One of my two favorite editions of A&A, thanks to Japan accumulating Victory Points and forcing the Allies to race against time to defeat them. In terms of strategic depth and game length, this may be the best value in the entire A&A lineup.

RATING: 7
As with all the A&A games, this takes a while to set up and a reasonably long time to play, but has nice simple mechanics so it's easy to explain.  Unique elements to Pacific include convoy routes that generate income for one player only, but can be disrupted by an enemy; combat air patrols which allow you to guard sea zones with nearby fighters; and naval and air bases that provide movement bonuses to friendly troops.  I always enjoy A&A when the group is right and there is enough time to play.

My prefered version of Axis and Allies. It is simple enough without being simplistic.   Fun to play, with a duration that is not too excessive for its subject. My only concern is that there is already a lot of "theory" concerning the opening moves and winning strategies. For some, this indicates the depth of the game and is a good thing. For me who is now too lazy to study for my games this can be a problem when playing with much more experienced opponenents. But it will provide a satisfactory experience for gamers of similar level of experience who would like to visit the Pacific Theater of Operations during WWII but don't wish for the complexity of a "true" wargame. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
So far I really like this version of A&A, but I've only played a few times. Maybe in the future I'll end up lowering my rating. I like the emphasis on naval combat and Island hopping. I think the more experienced players should probably play the Japanese. They have much to do, and a huge 1st turn.

It lacks a variety of diverse strategies to win, and it's essentially a game of numerical superiority vs. the ticking clock. Reminds me of Avalon Hill's old Victory in the Pacific game in that respect. Nicer pieces than the original Axis & Allies, decent game board, yet it really doesn't exactly capture the feeling of the war in the Pacific quite right. It really actually captures the feeling of the original Axis & Allies but in a strictly Pacific setting.

Though enjoyable, Grant pretty much toasted this game by demonstrating that there is a nearly unstoppable Japanese strategy.

Fun, focused A&A game that's very tough for the Japanese player. Seizing India, Sydney, or the Western USA are challenging victory conditions, but seem more plausible than getting 22 VPs with minimal input. The board could be bigger too.

That said, this is a nice spin on A&A, particularly for three players. The sea routes add strategy, and CAP rules make you think hard about how to use your fighters.

RATING: 4
Great concept but horribly out of balance.  The 2nd edition is much better for Japan being the solo Axis player.  If played optimally, Japan should win most often.  When they lose, they will be so far out of place that the Allies steamroll.

If you can avoid the balance issues, this one requires Japan to work quickly or the Allies will storm back.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's essentially a dice fest but captures the feel of the Pacific war in a fast paced system. The game is also surprisingly historically accurate compared to the lightness of the game, even though the game is far from a wargame. Well balanced with FAQ rule changes.

RATING: 6
Takes the best part of Axis & Allies (island-hopping) and adds a few modern ideas to keep it fresh. With 3 theaters of war to worry about, decisions are now more complex than dividing your IPCs by 3 and figuring out how to allocate the remainder. Strangely, a more complex game is now divided between 3 players only, with 2 who really control two sides, but that's definitely OK, vanilla A&A has too little strategic value and downtime per side.

VP track gives a nice hold-on-for-dear-life feel to Japan, Britain takes a beating early and holds the line while dividing between two theaters of war, while USA figures out how to spend its IPCs.

Twilight Imperium fills my island-hopping needs now, but if in need of something lighter, I could give this a whirl.

3+3
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Much more historically acurate than the original, in terms of relative numbers of units, and starting locations.  The different victory conditions keep play balanced too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The only addition I think is truely worth mentioning. Europe doesn't cut it, let alone D-day or (unfortunately) Battle of the Bulge. All are flawed, since some of the imporant features (like deciding what units you're going to buy) is not featured. This game to some is broken, but the gambit that apparently causes it - the India gambit - never pulled trough more then once. So the game is as solid as ever!

Edit 23/02/08: after our eight game we are coming to grips with the fact that it is too hard for the Allies to win with the original setup. We will play one more time with the original setup. This time Mac can bite the bullet ;-) If he wins as the Allies; we keep the original rules and I have to cope with the fact that Alcohol is finally ruining my brain cells. If not... well then we will convert to the new setup provided by Avalon Hill... Not good, so I reduced the rating to 8.

Allas, we tried it this weekend, but it didn't work out. The Allies lost again... Now we need to accept the altered set up and see if it will stand on its own. If not... Well, we'll have to cross that bridge when we get there.

Played a turn at some convention or other, at the WotC booth. Had a lot of fun - cool bits, relatively simple rules. So I got a copy (for free :) ). But then I tried playing with some friends: way too slow, and too many plastic chits on the board! Reminded me of my middle-school days playing Squad Leader and stuff ... yuch! Also, I didn't like all that dice rolling for combat. If you have to roll, rolling high should be GOOD! But way too much die-rolling here.

There actually is a real game here.  The game is almost perfectly balanced and quite interesting.  It captures the feel and tactics of the pacific war tolerably well.  This is kind of a first in an Axis and Allies game.  It suffers from the fixed set up problem that the rest of the games have.  Eventually as optimized strategies are figured out, the game will become more and more scripted.  But, amongst the best of the Axis and Allies games.

If the allies hold their attention after Japans MASSIVELY long first turn its a fun game if playing casually and the naval centered campaign is very satisfying.  Competitive rules-lawyering play, like any game, can seriously dampen the experience though.

RATING: 8
I think this is another great game.  I see people saying it is tilted to the Japanese and others saying its tilted to the Allies.  That tells me its pretty even.  I think the pieces and the game as a whole look really cool (like AAE).  I think the game is better balanced than AAE also.  My one big gripe and the reason that I am giving it the same rating as AAE is that by the time the game is about half over, sometimes it seems that you can see who is going to win. I guess I'll have to keep playing to find out if this problem continues to hold true.  Both sides have won at different playing sessions and is not heavily tilted to one side or the other. I think its a fun game to both look at and play!

After reading over all the A&A games, I decided this one looked best.  However, after setting up my first game, I only got about 10 minutes into it before I realized I didn't know wtf I was doing.  There could be a great game in here, but this may be a case of expectations (and not equating to what I was looking for).

Beautiful pieces and the whole of the Pacific campaign with a light ruleset; suffers from the long playtime of A&A and has more downtime than 'basic' A&A.

Lots of setup time for the value of the game.  It is also a bit tough in that it is only a good game for 3 players.  Not bad, but not great.

This version of the game took a step in the right direction by introducing some new concepts which eventually made it into the core games. Excellent take on the traditional game, but the odds of Japan actually winning are low.

The Japaneese first turn is a real BEEYOTCH, you have to reach far, but not to far. You also have to really do some damage to the US, to keep them out of the war as long as possible.

One of the weaker war games that I have played up to this point.  The game is too dependent on luck and resource points.  In some ways, the game is well-designed and the open-endedness of the play options enable it to be fun depending on who you find to play it with.  While I am glad that the game operates on accumulating victory points and that it will end within a reasonable amount of time, the way that this game runs gives the Japanese a very high chance of victory.

Yesterday's excitement. I had A&A:Europe myself, which I liked until I got to know more mature wargames. My main criticism is that A&A takes way too long and many decisions is just micro management. Needs elegance. But for a boy aged 13 it's wonderful.

A better game than the original.  Newer pieces and rules make the game more interesting, while the focused map intensifies the experience and gives secondary objectives.  After a number of replays, the game basically breaks down the same as the original did, but it's simply more fun.  The naval aspect of the war is much more prominent, so if you enjoy this part of the franchise, then you will definitely enjoy this game.

My son was given this game when he was about 8 years old. He was so excited and we played several times while I was usually Japan. It was interesting trying to hold out against the British and Americans who become stronger and better organized [hopefully], when as Japan it usually becomes harder to replace your losses as the game progresses, especially capital ships and aircraft.

By far the best of the early Axis and Allies spin-offs. The best parts of this game were actually absorbed back into the rule sets of later Axis and Allies reprints, so while this is indeed an excellent game, it has become somewhat of an irrelevant one.

RATING: 7.5
I like the concept of using minis in a game.  Helps bring in non-cardboard-players to the game.  BUT, the map is too small to play this game.  If the map was as bid as WAR! Age of Imperialism, then it could work I guess.  Otherwise, counters counters counters...

RATING: 7
The game is a bit shorter than other A&A games, with the, exception of the first turn (which is a marathon one for the Japanese player). The game is in fact designed to be limited in time, which can be nice. Seems like a well balanced game and I enjoyed it more than A&A Europe. Would love to play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A sequel that exceeds the original.  The game is a bit imbalanced in favor of Japan (after applying setup errata; before, the effect is pronounced), but it's manageable.  The China front makes for a nice tar-baby, and the extra chrome all makes sense and fits the theater.  All varieties of A&A can produce lucky swings, and this is no exception.  Manageable time, too, as the victory conditions prevent the interminable sessions of its ancestor.

After all the reprints and new versions that have come out since, I'm amazed that none use the VP clock.  It works perfectly, and now, in contrast, all the other games in the series pale considerably because of their nonsensical victory conditions.

axis and allies game primarily for 3 one beinf japan anoterh aemica and  the 3rd briatin australi and india, additional rules form teh standard game introduce air and naval bases and kamikaze attacks, plays well with (obviously) much more importance for naval power, the japanese must grab as much teritory as they can and hold it long enough to make an ecomnomic victory possible before the economic superpower that is america swamps them. japan must also contend with a prolonged slogging match in china and commenwealth attacks, all in all fun but can take awhile to play

In this game, three main powers (Britain, Japan, and the US) square off against each other against the backdrop of the Pacific ocean. Japan is trying to grow her empire, either through military might or by holding off the Allies long enough to consolidate her gains.

The game adds a few new rules and a few new twists to the established A&A game system. Naval bases and air bases turn small, meaningless islands into vital strategic holdings. Convoy zones allow a single submarine pack to cripple an economy. The Chinese forces, while limited, are hard to crush. Japan gets her kamikazes, but will it be enough to hold off the vast economic power of the USA?

Fun.  Seems a little more open to varying options than the original A&A.  

What I like about this more than most A&A games is that there is a reason to keep playing after the tide has turned.  That is, the Japanese can still win even after they're being pushed back to their island if they can keep their production high enough for long enough.  That aspect is missing in both of the newer 1940 games (Europe and Pacific) which seems like an odd choice to make.

I'm glad I played, but I don't think I need to play again. While repeated playings could help speed up the game considerably, the set up, rules explanation and sheer physical manipulation of bits (when purchasing units, placing/moving units or dicing in battles) simply takes far more time than I'm generally willing to commit -- especially compared to what I felt was a fairly limited pool of decisions to make. Our 3 player game took 3.5 hours, and we only completed 2-1/3 turns (Japan capitulated after his 3rd player turn). Perhaps more nuance would reward a player investing additional time into the game, but I think there are games that offer a comparable wargame experience in far less time, with less fiddly component manipulation.

This game disappointed me. I was hoping that the new map and factions would reinvigorate me into playing some more A & A, but this version felt off. The sides were obviously unbalanced by design, but the VCs were constructed in a way that just lets Japan bulrush India with everything before the Allies can get in the way. Naval combat has always seemed kind of stack-warish as well, but bad rolls have a bigger impact in this than in the original because the naval units are so expensive and Japan is so poor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quite interesting, since it modifies the feeling of play due to alternative goals to the mother game and the focus on naval warfare. perhaps the best choice of the series if you are exactly 3 players. any other number should prefer the second edition.

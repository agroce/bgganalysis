Quick reaction game. Not my genre. Rating is not about the game but about the genre. Every player still gets some card, even when being last all the time. That is a postive aspect.

Elke ronde draait iedere speler 2 monsterkaarten om.
Je moet snel ageren om te kijken of jouw helden deze monsters kunnen verslaan; zo ja, dan klets je er je hand op.  (Links of rechts)
Deze monsters kan je dan gebruiken om je helden te versterken.

Beetje aggressief, maar leuke filler.

vous avez deux mains ? Ça tombe bien dans dungeon rush vous avez deux personnages. Vous devriez combattre le bon monstre avec la bonne main avant les autres. Un petit jeu de vitesse, d'observation et de dextérité.

RATING: 8
It's a quick, fun filler. If you treat it as such, you're in for a treat. It's definitely one of the best in the reflex category, much better than games such as Dobble because you have some decision-making: how to build your 2 characters, go for points or upgrades, how to defeat a boss.

Less about how fast you can slap cards, and more about how fast you can read cards that are pointed every which way. And remember which of your hands corresponds to which boring set of statistics.

When I played, people just left their hands on the cards after slapping, rather than picking them up or anything like that. So there was also an element of craning your neck to see what was unclaimed. Was this fun? Yeah, kind of. The whole thing is only fun because it's awkward in the first place.

Not for me, but if you like it fast & funny, this is a very solid offer I guess.

The more the merrier game, for sure. With right people and at the right moment, surely can be a great fun. It has a great and funny mechanic, in which players are basically slapping their hands on cards and sometimes (more often than not) end up smacking their fellow dungeon raiders. This is clearly a mechanic that becomes more fun the more there is players involved. So the premise is quite simple D&D stuff: players represent all sorts of dungeon raiders from all your typical fantasy classes, like wizards, paladins etc. Your job is to explore three ever more difficult levels of the dungeon, fighting monsters and collecting loot. At the same time you are equipping your hero with better armor and weapons etc. At the end of the third level, there's going to be a huge boss battle, and who ever prepared the best is capable of killing it and basically winning the game. This kind of game could be a co-op, but I guess that in that case it wouldn't be using this particular card picking mechanic. It wouldn't make sense. The game just lacks in longevity, you don't always find time for it. It's soon to be seen what it has to offer. It's filler size game, perhaps if you're having a boardgame night with your friends themed around fantasy, perhaps playing games like Descent, Talisman, Runebound, Dungeon Quest etc. this could work as one of the fillers, because it's in the right theme. But it's not for main event and it's not even that much fun if played with anything under 4 players.

両手でやるカルタ。手ごとに能力を身につけ拡大再生産していき、その結果取れる札も変わってくるのが新しいし、楽しい。最後のボスを倒すのは困難だがやりがいがある。

Quick speed slapping which innovatively makes players to use both hands. Plays quickly and is a lot of fun. Graphic design is very clear and there are lots of neat references to other games and fantasy pop culture.

A fun little speed game. Not actually my cup of tea, but it won't take that long so I'm ready to play it if someone wants. Unfortunately there are some usability issues when you need to stack weapon cards under your hero card - it's easily a mess...

RATING: 5
Beating monsters to strenghen the capacities of your two heroes. Simple but effective mechanism. It's just that the cards tend to move when you already have a whole bunch and need to add another and shove it underneath. Tablecloth doesn't help that proces either.

A clever and fun simple realtime dungeon crawl.
Not much skill involved, but a quick and fun experience that you'll want to play a couple of times in a row.

RATING: 5
Pretty much exactly what one expects. This is a speed game where the primary challenge comes from remembering what your capabilities are for each hand. It feels more like calculation than memory. It's a fun, breezy thing, but not something I would actively seek out.

RATING: 6
Reaction test pattern recognition games will always have limited appeal. However, this is a fine example in the genre. I'm not usually in the mood for this, but this is a fine example of the genre.

Indifferent.

The best speed slapping game there is, hands down. Accept no substitutes.

Amazing job by both the developer and the illustrator: the cards are full of easter eggs and brilliant thematic ideas. Card artwork fits the game perfectly, and the skill icons are easy to recognize even at full speed.

It's a bit different, and a bit of fun, slapping your hands on cards to claim them if you think you can defeat them - and it's not that obvious whether you can.

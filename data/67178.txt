Good abstract with attractive components and a nice scoring mechanic. The rules are simple -- just a few sentences long --, but once you start playing your realize just how devious Water Lily strategy can be.
Abstract buffs should not dismiss this for the low recommended age and the kiddie looking theme: When played competitively, this is definitely NOT a kid's game.
Sort of like Hey! That's My Fish!

My kids loved it but even I suffered a lot to figure out any strategy here... I think they loved the hidden points and the slope gimmick but the gameplay is a classic dry abstract.

I'm hesitant on this one.

RATING: 7
Initial review:  This game plays quickly, and certainly has some interesting decisions in it.   Do you move your pieces out first?  Do you wait?   

The idea of hiding who you are doesn't seem to really matter much, nor is it particularly easy to do if you are trying to rush your pieces to victory.   So that's a little flawed.

Overall though, it's a good challenge trying to maximize your score.   Starting out rating 7.

RATING: 7
This is a quick-playing children's game, or its a cagey secret-roles game of clever tactics, misdirection and deduction (played with adults).  I think it works fantastically on either level.  

There may be a turn order advantage for the first player, but I suspect with more play that will prove to not be an issue.  The fact that you can slowly figure out what color frogs the other players are interested in (if you are playing close attention) but you never know for SURE is what makes this game work at a serious-play level.  

An overproduced (that's a GOOD thing!) clever filler that won't get the attention its deserving of by adult gamers.

Juego abstracto que usa la propia caja como parte del tablero. Es un juego de roles ocultos (solo tú conoces tu color) en el que se van moviendo unas ranitas que se tirarán por una rampa que está oculta, de modo que tienes tirar de memoria para saber si ya había alguna rana dentro, porque las primeras en llegar puntúan menos y las últimas también.

This is a pretty fun game!  Played with my 6 y.o. and 9 y.o. who tied (exactly) for the win because their memories are much better than mine.  Looking forward to more plays.  My son made up a "flicking frogs" game afterward by sliding the frog discs across the board into the slots for points.  That was pretty fun too.

Recuerda al 'Carrera de tortugas' pero el diseñador pensaría que había que complicarlo para así parecer mejor juego, aunque me temo que le ha salido rana (como el tema del juego). El Rafa, como fijo que nadie quería el juego ni regalao, lo donó a la asociación y así hacer sitio a su estantería. La próxima vez que traiga un mojón así, lo apedreamos! ;-)

Water Lily looks easy and for really small kids, but I don't think so. The mechanic is simple but winning is not so.

It's a very interesting game to help kids developping memories and thinking I think. Give it a try !

Brought by Santa Claus.  1st play 12/25/10.  My daughter had no clue how to play this well.  I killed her and ended the game as well.  Played 3-player game.  I won again even though Mystery Bob played all his frogs and I only got 3 of mine in the pond.  Mystery Daughter still doesn't "get" the game.


Update 7/17/11:  This game just keeps getting better and showing different ways to approach and play it.  It can be an attacking game, a strategy/tactical game, or a race.  Any way you play it, it is fun and interesting.  Raised to a 9 rating.

Players: 2-4
Duration: 20 mins
Type: children's racing

I rate children's games according to how excited I am to play with the appropriately aged child.  And although fun for adults too and a good family game, this leans towards more of a child's game.

Simple, well explained rules.  Easy to set up.  Short duration.  Good quality, nice components.  Box used as gameboard with a built-in slide.

Fun strategy with the covered slide. Can't reach the hidden slide too early or too late.  Most points wins. First in the slot scores 1, on up to four.  Those after position 4, score nothing, so remembering how many have entered the covered slide helps win.

Players can move any frog, not just their own, to position their frog for the highest points.   This encourages good planning.

This is a fun game to play with children, one I hope they request more often than others.

RATING: 6.5
Water Lily is a highly enjoyable family game that keeps children engrossed and adults engaged.  It is easy to learn and plays exceedingly quickly -- ten minutes or so.  When playing with adults, the game takes on a more tactical nature, as players cagily maneuver frogs so as to delay the movement of their own.  With children, the game is far more random, but still fun.  It is ideally suited as a family game, but works well as a light filler with adults.  The components are top notch, and the chute mechanism is clever and enjoyable.  It is exactly the type of game that should be in the game closet of anyone with young children -- and it won't send adults screaming into the streets at the mere thought of playing it.

RATING: 9.5
Great family game! Great usage of components and theme- the artwork is top notch! My kids love this game, and i as well. The gameplay is catered towards good memory and sneakiness- things the kids are very keen at ;-) - which adds to the excitement and attractiveness of the game. The usage of the game box and the slide mechanism to portray a "jump into the pond" theme is very clever! We love it!

There's probably a few too many hidden identity games, but this one is quick enough and overproduced enough to make it stand out. It does seem that when playing with kids it will be pretty obvious who is who, and the movement constraints mean that at some point you have to tip your hand. But there are some interesting decisions to make and the theme is kind of fun.

One of the best filler games I've played. It distills the hidden identity of games like Clans or Quicksand, and simplifies it so that kids can play.

It's got two things I dislike in kid's games - secret identity (so there's no cheering through the game) and hidden trackable information (which means you have to work rather than just concentrating on the fun). On the plus side, the components are nice and the movement mechanism is a nice one for kids to learn. There are 4 frogs in each colour. You move any frog forward in a straight line a number of spaces equal to or less than the number of frogs on your start space. You want other people to get to the finish lines (there are 5 of them) first or second (for 1 or 2 points) and your frogs get there 3rd or 4th (for 3 or 4 points), but not later (0 points). So if adults are playing it's a cagey affair of moving slowly but getting on top of stacks by mid-game but forcing other colours to move long distances early in the game. It all seems pretty obvious so it's hard not to give away your colour unless you're playing pretty randomly. With kids it ends up being, well, fairly random who gets moved when it's not your turn and your play is generally just to make the best of whatever the situation is when it gets back to you. All up it's decent and works ok, but it just wasn't satisfying and enjoyable enough for me.

A good little game that won't find an audience due to a theme and artwork that makes it look like a kids game. While kids can play it, there's more than enough here to keep adults on their toes. You've got hidden player identities, memory, and bluffing. All this and it comes in under 30 minutes. 

I won't say everyone should own it, but it's worth a play.

RATING: 6
Kids are enjoying it - the hidden mystery colours (like in Schildkrötenrennen) are always a blast for the kids to keep a secret and try and hide as long as they can. Players can move any colour and there's a certain angst built up as other players pop you down the pond too early or cover your piece up you were looking to move. So far this has been a winner with the kids and gets requested often. Probably the best kids game to come out of 2010 for my family.

RATING: 6.5
Cute, if overproduced, children's game. You're dealt a secret colour. Your goal is to try to move your colour into one of several 'slots' in the board. This will slide it down a chute into a hidden scoring position (1 to 4 points). Movement is determined by the number of frog tokens the top frog is one: if there are three in the stack, it moves 3 spots.

Game ends when the last frog of any colour is moved into a slot. Take lid off hidden slots and count up VPs.

Game tends to end in 5 mins or so. Not much strategy, just a little bluff, memory and delaying your pieces as much as possible.

Found for $14.99 at toysforthought.com.  This may seem a bit exaggerated at a rating of 9.  Yes, it's a children's game.  But really, it's one of those Hey, That's My Fish kind of games with a wonderful depth to it.  The graphics are wonderful!  The design with the little slide for the frogs going "under water" is genius and so very thematic.  My wife and a sat here laughing as we played.  There's this SCREWAGE??? factor to it.  But it's a wonderful type of screwage because you're not really sure if you're actually doing it.  The other person sits there and pretends like they don't care as their frogs die in the low depths.

Water Lily is either a charming kid's game, or light filler, or both.  But the gadget is the fun part, and that's the hidden tray with satisfying sounds of tokens sliding and landing with a clunk.  The length of that slide corresponds with points, so serious players listen carefully to confirm their strategy.

I think there's no need to hide the scoring part of the box. For deeper games eliminate the memory element of the gameplay and concentrate on pure thinking and bluffing.

Thus if not for children the game is easily made and compactly carried.

This may be advertised as a kids' game, but it has enough going on that it works pretty well for grown-ups, too.  We played a learning game with 5, which worked well enough, since there were 5 colors, but I can see this working even better with the one neutral color that belongs to no one.  It's a simple enough game with the positioning of the pieces lending enough choices and challenge to make the game work for players of all ages.  It's just charming, fun, and just challenging enough for its timeframe.

It's got the blended movement mechanics of [i]Leaping Lemmings[/i] (topmost disks are moved) and [i]Emerald[/i] (spaces moved = group size), as well as the hidden color mechanic of a half-dozen games ([i]Heimlich & Co[/i], [i]Quicksand[/i], etc.).  But the package is a family-friendly ride, and a minor memory aspect is something that I'll always appreciate.

Bonus variant: Have the other players put the frog disks directly into your mouth and pretend that you're in a French café.  Good eats.

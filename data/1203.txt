I want to try a variant where you can sell witnesses and evidence.  I think it would be thematically appropriate and also make for more involving play (since everyone can be in on a trial, not just the parties directly involved.)  Haven't tried it yet.

We discovered the game was most fun with lots of lawyerly role-playing around the trials. The group want to play this again sometime, so the current rating (6) is likely to change.

Gameplay feels "off" like slightly spoiled milk. For ex: there's a useless card in the deck that no one wants. Still good fun.

High amounts of luck & chaos, and the game lasts too long.  The game is amusing for 1 or 2 plays.  IIRC, there are quite a few cards with special powers that slow down the game for newbies.

RATING: 7
A fun card game with more ways to use the cards than we ever remember. Love the theme. The Cheapass sense of humour is evident here. The artwork seems to be from the wrong period, but for some reason that just makes the whole thing even sillier. Those willing to roleplay may get even more out of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another great little Cheap Ass Game, but you have to be in the mood. And you need to take advantage of the plea bargain a lot, before your opponent knows you're out of cards to play. You can win that way.

RATING: 5.5
Geeklist buy 2010.  Reminds me a lot of Guillotine.  One unbalancing aspect is that it's hard to win as the defense.  The game is skewed toward conviction which fits the theme, but there's not much of a strategy as the defense.

Talk about a game where you learn to make plea bargans.  Maybe it was driven by the number of people we had playing (and it being the first time for all of us), but we had far more plea bargins than cases that went to a die role.

The basic mechanism of a base assertion as modified by competing player's cards to set a die roll is not one that I'm particularly fond of, but this works well and moves quickly for all that, and there is fun to be had.  Sometimes.  Well, in extreme circumstances like after rigor mortis has already set in and you need to keep the worms entertained.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players are dealt a hand of cards that can be suspects, charges, motions, evidence or objections. Suspects and charges are paired off to be sent to court. The player who builds the case is the prosecution, while one other player can volunteer (or be appointed) the defender. A mini-round of card play takes place where each player is trying to influence the outcome in their favour. A simple modified die roll determines the guilt or innocence of the defendant, with the winning player taking a cash prize. Once through the deck, most money wins. This one is a goodie. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You really have to act this game more than play it, totally throwing yourself into the role of a overly-dramatic trial lawyer and presenting your card plays with an improvised story. If you don't you're going to get nothing out of this game whatsoever.

If this were redone with nice think oversized cards this would jump to a 9.

One play with five. It's pretty creaky as a game — some of the players didn't even bother to count their scores at the end — but we all had an extremely good time laughing at the cards. It's the sort of thing that's fun to play once or twice, and then you're done.

Played twice.  This Cheapass game is a bit different from the normal experiences I've had with them - a bit more fiddly, and feels a bit longer than it should play.  

The learning curve for our first game was rough - for some reason it was difficult to wrap our minds around.  And like many Cheapass efforts, it's a dry, mathy experience.

This is my favorite game in the Cheapass line.  There's some luck in what cards you get, but in essence it's a negotiating game --- where you seek to make the best "plea deals" while usong as fee cards as possible.  The game also oozes with theme, with the various and charges -- although it does lack a bit in replayability, hence it only comes out once every four months or so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Revised rating back up to 6 - this is actually quite a good game, and the most 'euro' of the CheapAss series.  The mechanics all hold well together and there is genuine strategy, particularly in when to defend a case, and especially in negotiating a deal - that's the crucial bit in the game.

This game is a blast. I played with 6 people total, and the game didn't seem to stall with that many players because people were too busy laughing at the current trial.

A surprisingly engaging game with decent enough production values for the less that $5 I paid for it.  I played it with my family tonight and everyone had a good time.  As a criminal defense lawyer by profession I particularly enjoyed the simulation of the defense goal of injecting uncertainty into the prosecution's case to encourage a negotiated disposition.  There was more than one point that I found myself laughing at the lighthearted but accurate reflection of an aspect of the criminal justice system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We have great fun with this game. The players are a cabal of corrupt lawyers, suing mostly innocent people for things that are considered crimes in only the most victorian of worlds imaginable. The guiltiness of the accused is of secondary (or tertiary) importance, only who gets which cut of their money and the court fees is of impact. Giving a good plea is the most important part, although we always imagine that all our clients get hanged after the trial either way.

A very good game if you enjoy courtroom roleplaying.  It’s fun to play up the silly dramatics of surprise witnesses, objections, and the odd crimes and evidence.  The game itself is really nothing special — There’s an interesting dutch auctionish mechanism for taking cards, but it isn’t nearly as important as the trials themselves.

Another great one from cheapass - VERY social, my friends love to play this one - they roleplay TOO much! :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game makes a clever and thematically apt use of the  card-buying mechanic familiar from some Euro games to provide unusually deep tactical gameplay for a Cheapass title. The trials are well-designed and suspenseful. My only serious quibble is that it seems to me when experienced games play this, almost all trials are likely to bargain out up until the endgame, which would be a little deflating. Having only played it solo, I can't vouch for what  roleplaying would add to the experience; it's a bit like GLOOM, though, I think, insofar as while there are plenty of good jokes on the cards, there's really not enough motivation to flesh out any genuine storytelling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Some Cheapass games are a lot of fun if you just read the description; some if you play them just once.  This is one of the few whose mechanics maintain your interest through multiple game sessions.

Takes the Cheapass strengths (amusing concept, price point) and attaches somewhat solid game mechanics for once. There's not much overall strategizing, mostly just a series of "what now" decisions. Also, can get periods of down-time during other players' trial periods. Most of the amusement wears after one or two plays (classic Cheapass).

RATING: 6
OK for a cheap and silly negotiation/storytelling game. Changing charges is a bit strange: "This woman is accused of suicide. As you can all see, she's dead. I rest my case." followed by "That is a common misconception, but the real issue here isn't that she committed suicide, but that she wore a hat in the theater! Not only that, but she turned Lester into a newt, so she's clearly innocent."

RATING: 5.5
An interesting game from Cheapass Games, players take on the roles of lawyers during colonial times charging or defending various suspects from various charges all to make money. The lawyer with the most money (or prestige) at the end of the game wins! Since this game is from Cheapass, you will have to provide some sort of currency (paper or other type of money from another game) and a penny or some other marker to track the jury. Players either take or buy cards, present a pending case by charging a suspect, defend a pending case or bring one of your own pending cases into trial. When there is a trial, the defending lawyer and the prosecutor go into court. The prosecutor plays as many cards he/shi wishes to bring up the jury number (1 being least likely to find the defendant guilty and 12 being most likely). Then the defense can present his/her case. After the defense rests, the prosecutor may play one last card. If the case hasn’t been settled by a plea bargain at this point (the lawyers may agree to divide the amount in the pot) a dice is rolled to determine if the jury finds the suspect guilty or not. The winner gets the pot. 

The game is fairly simple and fun. Players are encouraged to be colorful in how they present their cases, which is half the fun. The game mechanic itself is fairly straight forward. It is surprisingly enjoyable but I can see how it might be slightly group dependent. If you enjoy court room drama, you might want to give Witch Trial a look.

Negotiation game - very simple - there is a pot of money that you and your opponent can agree on how to split, or you let the dice decide if you can't agree.  The odds of winning via the dice depend on a number of factors, but you can play cards to increase your odds of winning and put leverage on your opponent to agree to a better deal.

I would not play with more than 5 due to down time.  The "humour" factor wears thin once you've seen all the charges.  I don't see this is a great candidate for a larger group or a "party" atmosphere unless everyone is kind of a gamer already.

Witch trial! Mostly a card game.

RATING: 7
This game took my group a long time to figure out, but once we began playing, it didn't seem so complicated.  It's a Cheapass game, with the usual spartan components, but the artwork of Charles Dana Gibson (of "Gibson Girl" fame) on the cards is a nice touch.  As others have commented, it's the role playing aspect that makes the game fun, and the silly "crimes," suspects, and evidence provide lots of amusing material to work with. (4+3)

Not a fan of dice games.  But I should mention that you probably are best off negotiating instead of going to trial.  An okay game (with a decent theme), but even without the trial verdict being a dice roll, the luck of the cards play a large portion in the game.

RATING: 5
Like most Cheapass' games there's a healthy amount of humour here and the game works. It's a little a slow and not much choices to make, you play your cards and hope the opponent's cards aren't as powerful.

Seems to play long. Definitely more fun if players act out the roles of lawyers and judges. Without a good group of players, this is more like a 5.

If I had to pick one Cheapass game as my favorite, this would be it.  It's gotten a lot of play over the years.  The fun is in the suspense over the outcome of each trial, and the haggling for plea bargains.  Also, it makes for a good 3-player.  (Not reccommended for more than 4.)  This game is a diamond in the rough; sure I'd get a more dynamic gaming experience from the prettier euros, but in the right group, Witch Trial is good, silly fun.

Ooh, I *can* do decimal ratings!  Keen, a 7.5 it is.  Once again, the actual mechanics of this Cheapass game doesn't really interest me too much.  My enjoyment derives almost completely from getting into the character of the game, as prosecution or defense, and thinking of ludicrous reasons why the various bits of evidence and whatnot can be used to further my "case."  This is one of my favorite Cheapass games actually, and I'm constantly bringing it up whenever anyone says they want to play a game.  It loses points bigtime when you play against people who aren't as willing to get into the spirit of the game, though - if you're more concerned with mechanics then this definitely isn't the game for you.

It has a neat playing process, and it's fun matching crime to suspect and role-playing during the trial segment. However, it has limited replayability because it's almost totally random.

It reminds me of Atlantic Storm in that two sides plop down cards to affect an eventual dice roll to see who wins or loses. The nice thing is you have an out -- you can negotiate a pre-dice roll settlement, which is what I do even when I have virtually no chance of losing the roll. This has the added benefit of encouraging my opponents to defend my cases.

I'd argue that this is the best Cheapass game EVER made.  It's necessary to do a bit of role playing as the lawyers, though...that adds a lot to the experience. =)

I'll also say that...while some might complain about the die rolls, the trick to winning consistently is to NOT put the trial to jury. You want to settle as many cases as you can, in general.  In doing so, you reduce the chance that luck comes back to bite you.

I must admit it really wasn't given a chance and a few more plays may have proved more enjoyable, however, I could not convince my gaming group to play this a second time. It is really very luck driven. 6/17/05 - GAME TRADED

Quite fun.  More laughs than your average Cheapass game.  More game than your average Cheapass game, too.  I'm the Boss!-style negotiations, that is, can you agree on how to split the pot or would you rather empty your hands fighting over it?  The only game I know of with duelling lawyers.  Recommended.

Players represent lawyers in this humorous, pseudo-Colonial courtroom trial card game.

Each player attempts to prosecute victims and make money by winning the case. All lawyers pair a Suspect with a Charge card to represent the case they are prosecuting. However, money can also be made by defending the cases that other lawyers are working on. When a case comes to court, players add their Evidence cards, and make Motions and Objections, in order to sway the jury to their side. Then the case is either settled by plea bargain (an agreement by lawers to divide the case money) or by the jury (a 2D6 dice roll of 13 or more which includes all card modifiers played on this case). A fun game in which the lawyer with the most money wins.

We played the heck out of this one back in 2004. What a silly, fun game to play with your friends. The fun in this game comes from the ludicrous accusations you make -- and the insane excuses you have for trying a witch. I'm not sure how I'd feel if I played this one again today after having been exposed to more and varied types of games, but I have some very fond memories of this one.

Played this a few times (hence, I reckon I got my money's worth) and had fun.  Atmosphere is good, especially if you have a cynical/sarcastic bunch of players.  Might be a better game if it was easier for the defense to win cases? (he says, trying to remember the course of play...)

Update: This has become one of my favorite "Cheapass" games. Underrated and hilarious -- reading the card text the first few plays is simply a must! I don't necessarily think you have to Roleplay, to enjoy the game, just appreciate the setting. *Better than "Deadwood", and don't even bother with "Get Lucky".

45 min?! More like over an hour! The duration of the game wore down the fun for me. I liked the art design and the humor of it. You really must play up the text of the cards and get into acting like a really sleazy lawyer. It's just not enough to justify the interminably long mid-game.

One of those games that require roleplaying in order to be fun. Cards are played and collected and sometimes trials occur, where you play accusing cards and defending cards. The ad-hoc motivations for these card can be hilarious.

A very funny game, if you like this kind of games (a bit like Chez Geek etc). If your group is able to roleplay out their cards this will be a riot!

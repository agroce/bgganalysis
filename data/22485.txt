It came with too many yellow tiles and not enough red.   There is enough to play the game with regular setup but the 3rd ring will be half yellow and half red instead of entirely red like the instructions say.

I don't know if it is the components (my box was wet and the cardboard soft upon opening), whether it was the cartoony artwork, or whether it's because I'm sick of space themes after my work on getting Right Ascension signed with a publisher (and still revising it)... I just can't get excited about this, in spite of several attempts.

I really enjoy how space exploration comes across in this game. If anything, I'd love to take what this game offers and add more interesting elements out there in space. However, the beginning is a little same-y slow and the ending is sort of a few turns too long in 3+ games (2 players is just right, oddly enough).

This is a little nice game about space exploration. It's a bit weird because it's an hybrid between an Euro and an AT (pick up and delivery, space fighting with dice). The production is quite good for some aspects (nice artwork, sturdy big space tiles) but awful for others (why the spaceship boards are so thin? And the punch out was a mess...). The setup is quite fiddly. Anyway, it's an ok game at least, and a good first game from Tasty Minstrel Games.

Really fun game to play and fast game rounds (even with five people).Easy to understand but the rules are a bit holey but then again that is to be understood with the problems that went with the making of this game (I'm so sorry for him).We did have a few house rules though as well like:making the to-hit number when attacking aliens one higher than the guns you have (other wise you won't win against those guys). and: also having two more "pathways" from Tera Prime to make it just a bit easier through out the game.Like I said easy and fast gameplay. GLYAASDI! --Nate--

Based off prototype (have played more times than the count here shows, some were recorded as Unpublished Prototype), which will not change much if at all in the next few months before production.

The game features some decent mechanics; weapons, shields, and colonization have all gotten stronger with time.

My main grief is still, and forever will be, with the tile-flipping.  Going into a tile fairly geared-up but not knowing what awaits you almost never hurts you badly enough to reward looking at a tile before leaping in.  Looking at the tiles is tantamount to wasting an action.  The tiles vary wildly, and the same tile could be extraordinarily non-threatening to extraordinarily threatening.  

I think there are some more balance issues to work out.  There is not enough reward for shooting aliens at present (there used to be too much, it possibly got nerfed a bit too far), it is by far much better to follow someone and colonize after they take care of the threat at their entire risk for double the points.

The game, ultimately for me, is a "serious game with too many random elements to be a serious game."

Fun space exploration game.  The rule book could be organized in a clearer fashion, and the components could have been produced to a higher quality.

However, once you get the rules down the game plays without issue, and is a lot of fun.

For a light exploration space game, with multiple strategies you could do worse.  

I like Tasty Minstrel and bought the game as it was OOP,  I hope they reprint with upgraded quality as it is a game the deserves to be played.

I love this game. It is great to play as 2 player, but best at 4.  It can be "boring", but I find that is more of someones style of play verses the game itself.

Space exploration and development. Cube delivery in space. The bits are poorly produced by modern standards - I found myself harking back to the '70s with the fiddly counter removal process needed to avoid spoiling the counters. Makes me appreciate how far game production values have come. Not a good start.

The layout, exploration, action regulation and objectives seem well thought out - although it looks like it could be long and brutal experience to get going effectively.

Rules regarding movement are rather thin on the surface - I'll be looking for a FAQ for some aspects of this one. I'm a fan of the space exploration genre so I'm hoping play will improve my first impressions. Rating is very preliminary.

Definitely takes a game to understand some of the nuances.  One problem our group sees is the random distribution of the reward tiles.  You can be greatly helped by these or they could be completely worthless to you.  Next play, I will recommend having some reward tiles face up to pick from so people have more strategic choices.

In our second game, we fixed two rule errors.  One concerning the placement of tiles, and more importantly, the delivery of cubes to the demand tiles.  This greatly improved everyone's opinion of the game and the random reward tiles were pretty much forgotten about.

Much more fun than Ad Astra.

I got this mainly because I liked Homesteaders and felt like giving another shot to a new company that turned out a good game. I wanted to like Terra Prime, and the rating might go up with another play, or it might just not come off the shelf again - hard to tell. It's very much a recycled game, with stuff borrowed from Starfarers of Catan, Starship Catan, and Merchant of Venus, but Terra Prime suffers from being both a bit too long and having pacing problems. It simply takes too long for plans to develop and for the game to unfold, with too many turns spent doing not much and too much opportunity for analysis paralysis for those who are so inclined. I think it's close - the concept is good - but it's just not quite tight enough, not clean enough, and not thematic enough to cover for those failings. I'd like to play again, but I'm not optimistic that the game has much of a future for me.

First of all, the designer rates his own game a 10? That's pretty lame. That being said, it's a decent enough game. Take a space ship, go out in space looking to colonize new planets. Get smashed up by asteroids, and get shot at (and maybe shoot back at) aliens. Go around and pick up resources produced at colonies and buy various ship upgrades there. Get vp for others using your colonies. Collect resources and take them back home to either sell or trade in for enhanced technologies. It could be my relative lack of interest in sci-fi, but while it seemed to flow ok, I didn't find myself eager to play again.

A light 4x game I suppose. The mechanics are generally fine, but the board is fiddly because the ships are too big for the sectors.

It seems that getting shields on turn 1 is a must, otherwise you're going to get hosed. The combat system is a little goofy, and putting more guns on your ship has an exponential effect.

On the whole, it's ok but nothing special. There can be too much down time between players. I wouldn't recommend with more than 3.

The first time we played with a rule wrong that caused the game to run really long.  We played again and fixed the rule, and the game improved drastically.  However, the shorter game had problems where it was very same-y.  The second game had of a lack of brownium early, which meant few tech advances were made until the end of the game.  That I'm keen to play a third time is either obstinance or an indication of something to the game.  Downgrading my rating because as it stands I think the start players have a huge advantage.

Got this one for free at BGG.CON 2010 and didn't really have any expectations one way or the other. Now that I've a chance to play it twice I have to say it is better then I gave it credit.

Very flexible in what you can do and how you can win. Fun build your ship and explore aspect (think Settlers of Catan in space with mystery tiles).

Two main gripes is the fussyness of all the bits on the board and the quickness of your turn (you don't get to do very much on a given turn... so it can be dull to take several turns to only move on a map).

Still... for $0 it was a steal!

Homesteaders was one of my favorite games this year. So, I was interested in trying Terra Prime (published by the same company.) But I must admit, I did not have high hopes because I haven't really heard any positive buzz around BGG.

Anyway, I played a two-player game with my woman and I had a great time! The exploration of space with the asteroids and the space battles is fun. The economic building with the colonies and such is strategic and involved. I can't wait to try this with 3, 4, or 5 players.

I had a great time. I can't understand why this game isn't getting the same buzz as Homesteaders.

This game is Agricola in space, but with more strategic options and the theme is much more fun. Instead of a farm, you're upgrading a spaceship. Very nice economic-type game with some light fighting involved (between you and alien ships - not between players). This is one of those rare games that can be played very well with just two players.

The game is a bit damp.  Literally.   Regardless, this is a fairly typical space exploration game with an economic engine tacked on.  Very very fiddly --with lots of bits and a board that easily falls apart.

Add a "frame" around the board to keep the pieces from sliding around, and get rid of the LPs (leadership points) by using a scoring track or something -- would help with the many many bits for the rest of the game.  

All that aside, the game is quite fun and it is easy to underestimate the amount of strategy involved.   It would be nice if players could send the aliens against other players --something to help catch a leader.

A good exploration game, which is fairly simple, but still very interesting to play.

This is probably the worst game I've ever punched. It was a pain to cut it out without destroying the counters and I often had to use a sharp knife. Also gave all the cardboard pieces a feeling of humidity. Also the printing are not synchronized on both sides, As it cost as much as any other game, I had expected better component quality. But I'm looking forward to play it now when the 4-hour job is done..

RATING: 6
I liked the theme, and space exploration games are pretty rare these days.  It handles it in relatively simple way, but still interesting enough strategy.  You have choices on how to upgrade your ship, where to explore, and settle.  Also you will inevitably need others' colonies to get needed upgrades and cargo.  There seem to be plenty of streams for VP's, such as cargo delivery (money is worth 10 to 1 VP + Demand contracts), exploration in the outer rim, developing technology, placing colonies others want to use, etc.  Lots of ways to get points is a good thing.  In my only game, however, the end game seemed to drag out, as we started running out of choices. 

We might have been doing something wrong, however.  We didn't have an asteroid colony until we were into the red ring of space, thus much technology which is needed for red exploration was unavailable previously.  We thought an asteroid mine could only be placed if it was next to planet.  It's possible we did this wrong, and a mine can be placed without a planet.  Also we were not rolling for asteroids unless someone STOPPED on the junction.  I'm sure that was incorrect.  I'm still looking forward to playing.  

I think with further and smoother plays, my rating can only increase.  

THANK YOU SO MUCH TASTY MINSTREL FOR THE FREE GAMES AT BGG.CON.

I enjoyed my first game of this but it was quite fiddly to play since there is a lot of flipping of tiles, balancing bits of cardboard and pieces on top of other pieces, etc. The gameplay itself was fun though and I see a few different strategies that I'd like to explore in more detail.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly good. The amount of theme is just right: not so much to interfere with playability and make the game too long, nor so little to make it too abstract. There is some luck in the exploration and dice rolls, but since the player may spend an action to peek at face-down tiles, it's up to him to decide what risks to take.

A good but not great pick up and deliver / space colonization game. Multiple paths to victory and a lot of cool moving parts. The ship upgrades and modules give it a variable player power feel which is very cool. The scoring is pretty balanced. My only gripe is that is feels like it should be a low luck game- turn optimization and vp engine games typically are- but it is not. There is a ton of luck, from die rolls to discovering new tiles. The game offers a lot of ways to mitigate that and avoid it if it isn't your cup of tea. In a lot of ways, this game can't decide if it wants to be a euro-ized merchant of Venus ripoff or a tightly designed economic euro. It doesn't really suceed at either, but the result is still a good game.

Update:  I've played it a second time and I'm a little turned off by the turn order issues in a five player game. It plays better with 4.  Whoever goes last is at a significant vp disadvantage because they won't get a colony on the way to prime,and to make up for this likely 5-10 vp swing you get the equivalent of one vp.  The luck issues also still bother me- not because I dislike luck, but because it is frustrating to have so much luck in a game that is at it's core a pick up and deliver efficiency engine game where you carefully plan each turn for maximum efficiency.  Luck doesn't belong there.

Dec09: (Published Version)

Got in a second game of Terra Prime with the wife tonight.  How'd it go?  Let's break it down.

Pro#1 - Box open to box close was 60 minutes.  That included setup and tear down.  Very good news compared to our 120 minute first excursion.

Pro#2 - Scores were close.  Nobody got totally blown away by the Aliens.  We equally explored and delivered.  I won by about 10 points.

Pro#3 - The game did feel different this time.  For one, we never had a green colony.  There was only 1 green planet in the hexes chosen, and it was on the red edge of a yellow tile.  Means fulfilling demand tiles was a bitch and had to use rewards to pay for things.

Pro#4 - Made better use of the bribe method of getting rid of aliens.  Less VP (By a lot.  Since you don't get a reward and have to lose resources to do it.), but also a lot less actions.


And then the cons:

Con#1 - We both ended up doing more or less samey things.  Explore some, deliver some.  It didn't feel as diverse as the first time.

Con#2 - The turns were so staccato.  I really don't like having some turns where it's just "move, pickup, move".  Sitting at Terra Prime in the middle of your turn and trying to figure out how many actions you've taken is annoying as shit.  This is code for the turns were not smooth.

Con#3 - My wife in particular got annoyed at being able to plan 3 turns in advance and then taking 5 minutes to play those out due to play time.  She knew she wanted to drop off cubes on the way to TP and go colonize the one dang Green world.  I was going a little slow on my turns and it was basically boring the crap out of her.  I can only imagine that feeling would get worse with more players.  There just wasn't a large number of important decisions per minute of playtime.  The important decisions were at the macro level "grab a cloaking device with some cube space to bribe some aliens and settle distant colonies".  But the decisions that dominated the playtime were the micro ones: "should I give up my last action so I can pick up this cube that will respawn or just go ahead and pick it up on my way back through".


Actual Rating: 5.5ish  Just not my cup of tea.

Had no expectations coming in to it - fell a bit flat in playing it.

I didn't find the decisions that interesting.  Colonized when it was convenient, killed aliens when it was convenient, explored when it was convenient, and delivered when it was convenient as opposed to trying to follow a specific path.  About the only thing I didn't do is get any of the advanced modules - just thrusters, shields, and lasers.  They seemed potentially worth playing with, but getting money and VPs seemed like the better thing to do every single time I had the option, particularly in the late game.

There are two highly optimal spots for colonization that players 1 and 2 must take advantage of in the early game.  get a planet there, and the VP will roll in if people (rightfully) make good use of said close colonies.

None of these decisions was difficult or painful to make.  Most of the time the choice was obvious.  Sometimes a quick check of what other people could do regarding resource delivery helped out.

In the end, I wouldn't mind playing the game a few more times to see if I missed anything, but I get the feeling that that would be enough to get my share of enjoyment from the game.

There is a lot of interaction - you can't but help trip over each other and compete for orders. Apart from direct combat I am not sure it could be more interactive !

I played several iterations of the game while it was in its playtesting phase. It's a delight to see the game progress from its humble beginnings to a full-fledged production.

As a pick-up-and-deliver game, Terra Prime performs quite well. Printing issues affect the physical board game to one degree on another and games tend to run a fair bit longer than I'd prefer, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.

Played first game (2-player) in two sessions. We had been frustrated in our first encounters because the aliens destroyed our modules/weapons and we then could not attack.  During the break we read the author's blog and gained some insights re. the best way to deal with the aliens.  Karen got the cloaking device and enough goods to pay them off and she was able to cope with the aliens then.

I think with 3 or 4 players we'll have fun trying different paths to victory.  Colonizing, goods delivery and combating aliens are all viable.

Played with 3. The game was better but the bits are small and hard to keep in place.  The different pursuits for getting points proved interesting.  Once Marcus had the lead there was not much we could do to slow or reverse it.

Played a prototype a BGGCon07.

As space explorers on the outskirts of known space from the Terra Prime spacestation, one attempts to win by attaining the most victory points.  The closer hexes are green, then yellow, then red.  Green is mostly safe, with less hostile aliens and asteroids.

Your ship card has upgradable modules and starts with only a cargo hold/no weapons/no shields, so you'll have to earn some money to make your ship deep space worthy. 

First, create some colonies by taking cryogenically frozen people to a planet (or asteroids which produce a unique good for the tech chart).  These start producing goods.  Pick up and deliver these goods back to Terra Prime to make money (or to go up on the tech chart for some special abilities like cloaking or increased revenue on deliveries).  You'll have to weigh the options based on your strategy.

Combat is fairly forgiving as you roll again if your first roll is a failure, stripping of a ship component.  There's even a political option to eject goods as an offering if your ship isn't combat worthy.

There are many ways to generate VPs. Money translates into VPs.  The further out the created colony is, the more VPs generated.  People picking up goods from your colony nets a VP.  Being the first to defeat each Red tile nets 2 VPs.
I played the merchant strategy, and VPs were similar to someone on combat/colonize strategy.

Some tweaking is still needed as Seth noted to us in that by the time we got to the furthest Red hexes, the game basically ended.

Player interaction is distilled to being a race since all are on the same side (humanity), but the turns move very fast so there is little downtime.

As I typed this, I realized how multi-leveled this game is and kept bumping up my rating.
It feels like a Runebound in space, except better and more streamlined.

I would like to see this published, curious on how the final artwork would be...quirky/cartoony or serious.

This game has been growing on my mind lately and I'd like to get it to the table. I think it plays better with fewer players but the one thing keeping it from coming out as often is that it can be unforgiving if you make mistakes. There isn't much you can do to rebuild your tempo once you lose it.

Despite my dislike of the Chinese production which saw the chits come out very poorly out of their cardboard sprues and tear a bit, the game itself I found enjoyable and entertaining with some solid game play.  In my first game, both the military and the merchant strategies seemed to be successful as there was only 4 points separating everyone.  The exploration concept is enjoyable, conflict is entertaining and one needs to be prepared for conflict or take extensive damage.  

Second play was disappointing - didn't care for how the random board setup arranged the universe.

Didn't like this game for a couple of reasons:

5) You lose your vp and modules far too easily
6) Bad production value: too flimsy cardboard for the price you pay

RATING: 4
Difficult game to rate. The game is good, and fun, but the color choices of the components are godawful. Blue colors on blue backgrounds, Green on green background? Wow! Awful. Across the table no one could tell which was which.

The inconsistent icons used on the otherwise useful printed player aids on the board made hay of the payout schemes. For example, in most cases triple payout is x3, but in some cases it is 1 + 1 + 1. Due to this difference, we kept taking x1 when we should have taken x3.

These issues seriously detracted and distracted from play. It's a shame that I can't just break this out and play it even now without serious reservations. That I had to paste up the chits with Bs and Gs to be able to tell Blue from Green is unforgivable. I hope these first time game designers and graphic artists learn from this poorly managed experience and wish them the best next time!

Some random elements yet with avenues to victory that rely on planning more than luck.

It's fast even with 5, and has some really adrenaline fueled moments.

It remains to be seen if it will hold up under continued plays.

Update: Repeated plays have shown that this game just starts getting good when it comes to an end. Certain avenues of victory seem only favorable to those who can start them first.

I'm really disappointed and of to the trade pile it goes.

This was not a bad little game. It offers multiple strategies, building up abilities to suit your strategy. Actually quite a good effort especially for a first offering from a publisher.

Well, it has some interesting elements- building up ship capabilities, deciding what to load, where to go, what to fight, etc.  Just seems too fiddly and there's a lot of back and forth running about doing almost the same thing over and over.

A good combination of pick-up-and-deliver, space exploration, power-ups (ship customization) and fighting.  The variable hidden tile board setup is good for replayability and influencing different strategies.  It can also bring some frustration as it stinks to pull up a tile that's not helpful or just hoses your ship to where you need to go back and rebuild.  About a 90 minute game so probably not a huge issue.

RATING: 6
Fiddly (certainly on the first play).

Mixed quality of components, some bits are really good, others are a bit naff (I'm looking at you player boards and you pink plastic cubes).

However I think that there is potential there with multiple ways to build up you points generating engine. I think that a second game would be smoother and I'd have a better idea what I was aiming for. I just don't know that anything here is new or any more well implemented than a number of other games.

I do want to give it another go before I dismiss it.

It was great fun, very quirky and original... enough strategy to keep me thinking, enough chance to keep me guessing (and praying.)

Quite cute. This is "just" bits and pieces of dozens of other games [Lost Valley, Roads & Boats, any "contract delivery" game, Settlers, Race For The Galaxy, whatever] but it comes together in a pretty decent little package.

These Tasty Minstrel guys have some pretty good design chops, it seems. I think it would be nice to see them really reach instead of just pulling their favorite parts of their favorite games and tossing them in a blender together.

The difference between something like this and something like a Splotter game is that Splotter steals shamelessly and then turns the mechanic on its head, whereas this just steals shamelessly and makes neat little mechanical pairings.

This was an ok game where you build up your ship so that it can survive the harsh elements of the great space, than you go out and try to score points.  There are many ways to score points in this game such as exploring, picking up goods, combat, and colonizing planets.  

In our game the owner of the game miffed up the tile stack so that the game ended abruptly and prematurely, but barring that, the production values were poor and the game itself was lackluster to me.  If I was looking for a space adventure themed game to add to my collection, I would have to look somewhere else.

I Love This Game!!! Resource delivery and management combined with space exploration!  Establishing colonies! Fighting hostile aliens! Navigating asteroids! Cool Josh Cappel artwork! Awesome design by Seth Jaffee! Can't wait for a reprint with expansion.
Warning: This is NOT a gateway game; the rules are too easy to mess up the first (couple) time(s) around.  Heck, besides the confrontations with hostile aliens in the game, you can easily have fist fights with your opponents while squabbling over the rules until sorted through.  Get through the the first (few) game(s) and It'll Be Worth It.  Many strategies.

RATING: 7
What I like:
- Space theme, well-executed
- No direct player vs. player conflict
- Multiple paths to victory
- Modular hex board

What I don't like:
- It's a bit longer and heavier than my ideal
- First few turns start very slow
- Easy to forget how many actions have been taken so far during a turn
- Expect 30 minutes of rules/setup when playing with new folks, unless they're willing to dive right in

First-time 4p games may take 2-3 hours, but 60-90 minutes is very achievable. The end of the game can come VERY suddenly, so try to warn newbies when it is approaching.

The 2p game really forces one player to go for aliens and the other to go for deliveries. Next time, I think I'll try with 2 of each tech, to give more flexibility. I'm ok if it has less tension without the cutthroat competition for hyperdrives and other goodies.

Overall, I would put the weight at 3.0.

This is an interesting space exploration and trading game.  Basically, you move your ship around flip over tiles to explore the galaxy, establish colonies, collect goods, and use those goods to improve your ship or get new colonies to build.  In the meanwhile, most things you do gets you some amount of victory points.  You also encounter hostile aliens, which you can make go away by paying them off, or shooting them down.  It seemed to me that the military strategy was underpowered, as by the time you were strong enough to shoot down aliens, the game was practically over anyway.

Original TMG game and I was curious to try it. Bright bold colors had me curious. I found it for a good price so I ended up buying it. Had I known it was Pick up and Deliver I might not have picked it up but I still gave it a shot anyway. It is a solid game. Pick up and deliver mechanic is just not for me. I find it repetitive and lose interest fast. That goes for about all games that have this mechanic that I have played. I think if you enjoy that then you would enjoy this one. You are building up your ship as you move and explore space. There are some aliens to fight off and some contracts to fulfill for points. Pretty simple game once you get going and I think would appeal to many folks. It is a game I will keep, but not play a whole lot.

Published game (say that as so many comments relate to the pre-pub versions).  

Nice mix of some path analysis and future planning.  Sure there is a random chance with the tile flippings, but having a key good where people can get it easily also pays of in VPs.  Primary attraction for me is the quicker playing time.  A first 4P playing lasted just under 2 hours with modest rules explanation.  Start with multiple paths towards VPs, but game settles down to milking key routes which come into being just as the game ends.  The end game timer might come too suddenly which some may dislike as another random element, but in the context of the whole game didn't bother me at all.

Extremely clever ideas, but the game lacks focus.  The many good parts are overshadowed by the flaws, and the entire game just doesn't come together.  The designer is clearly very clever, but needs a developer or co-designer to work with to iron out the kinks.

I really wanted to love this game but after 2 plays it just didn't click with my group.  It's a bit fiddly and the beginning game seems to screw the first player some.  There's a lot going on but frequently there's not a lot you can do on your turn.  Fortunately the turns go fast but I sometimes find myself spending several turns just getting somewhere.  Has some great design elements and lovely art but the parts don't seem to come together for a satisfying game.  I prefer Merchant of Venus or Perry Rhodan.

For some reason this game brings Settlers to mind -- there is no actual correspondence, except perhaps that it is an attractive theme, the components are thoughtfully designed, and the mechanics are intuitive and thematic.  A good gateway or post-gateway game.

My enthusiasm has cooled; economic strategies seem too weak, rewards are not well balanced, and one slow player more or less murders the fun.

2/2010 edit: The game is out! I rate it a 10, obviously. Some say it's uncouth to rate your own game because you're biased. Well guess what? I'm biased about EVERY game I rate!

People seem to like Terra Prime alright, which is awesome! I am currently working on an expansion for it which I think is really neat and fun.

The rating comments below are a little old, but I'll leave them for posterity. The game is coming out "any minute now" - in fact we're getting the pre-production proofs in about 2 days! I was very happy with the last minute development that happened to get the game ready to go to print, and Josh Cappel did a wonderful job with the graphics and rules editing. I can't wait to see this game on the shelves!

Edit: circa 4/09: With recent changes I've bumped my rating to an 8. I played the game 11 times in a week and didn't get sick of it! I'm hopeful that a publishing opportunity will be panning out for this game :)

Edit 4/09/09: This game is indeed getting published!

See blog posts at http://sedjtroll.blogspot.com for development. Tag = TP

4/9/09: There have been a lot of minor changes recently, and a major one. Look for more info soon about the "final" version (which should be in stores before too long!)

1/9/08: Played a couple games on a smaller board - it was pretty good! I've been tuning the rules this week so I can send to a potential publisher next week!

10/27/07: Upping my rating to 7.5. 8 is ambitious because it's still not "done," but I think the things that were bugging me are fixed :)

11/3/06: Tried new economics tonight - Demand tiles instead of Supply/Demand tracks. Worked well, but needs tuning of course. I think I need to institute an Income action - spend an action to get $1 (at Terra Prime). Also considering action: $2 at a mine (owner gets VP of course), and limiting the availability of resources (maybe 3 per colony, or X per colony, where X = Number of Players) to encourage exploration more and force the game toward an end.

EDIT 10/24/06: I haven't played TP in a while, something bugs me about the shipping points/money. Maybe someone can help me figure it out at BGG.con... Until then I've downgraded my rating.

Some say it's uncouth to rate one's own game, but I'm trying to give a reasonable, objective comparison to games on the market here. My rating may be a touch inflated because of personal bias toward liking a game, but then all ratings are biased by people liking the game they're rating...

I'm classifying Terra Prime as "Medium weight" because it's heavier than some lighter games, such as my previous BGG entry: All For One, but it's not a heavy strategy game like Puerto Rico or Caylus by any means. There is some chance involved in flipping tiles and rolling dice for combat, but these are small parts of the game. It is certainly more involved than Carcassonne for example, which has a similar tile-laying aspect.

RATING: 7
This was a game that I came to without any foreknowledge.  However, it looked quite interesting -- a space exploration development with some tech development and economics thrown in.  A very interesting combination that was a lot of fun to play.  One downside is that the pace of the game seemed a little bit off.  It seemed to take a while for much to happen then the game seemed to zoom to a finish.  Perhaps it was our inexperience showing.  The other downside was the atrocious cardboard compenents in the game which were not well stamped out of the sheets resulting in multiple counters with torn paper.  Overall, though, this is a winner for me. [12/29/2009]

An interesting resource-management & exploration game. Ran a bit long for me, but that may well be a first-time problem.

Preordered. 

Component quality is actually ok. It's just the printer's production values that let it down. What do I mean? The die cutting on the tiles were terrible. Their machines were misaligned and mispunched many flats. This means that many of the tokens and auction tiles are cut waaayyy off center. Some of the die cutting didn't punch through to the back side of the cardboard: this resulted in some LP chits ripping and one of the technology tiles actually split into two!

Seems like the printer also rushed the job and didn't allow time for the inks to dry. Lots of smudging as the sheets rubbed against each other. 

The rulebook was also crinkled from the damp. The staples on the Terra Prime rulebook were rusty on mine! WOW!

Anyway, looking forward to playing the game. Seems like it could work really well!

I really like this one as a light space trading game.  I think the 3-player game should probably be played on the same "map" as a 2-player game, to force increased interaction; without the interaction, it becomes more of a race, and there is little incentive to use each other's planets.  I think this game would play best with 5 experienced players, as there wouldn't be a lot of downtime, and trying to manipulate the system in your favor can be very tense.

I want to like the game more, but I just had an abysmal time playing it.  This is a logistical puzzle that seems like it should encourage great planning, but like many exploration games getting the right tile in the right place is more beneficial than most anything that you can do.  Who doesn't want to colonize a sweet planet right at the gates of Terra Prime.  You rake in VPs throughout the game for being first or second player. Flipping over a tile that wipes you out forces you to limp back to the main base losing everything that you had worked to build. 

In the mid 90s we learned how frustrating Eurogames were that had people do all the work for fulfilling some abstract set collection only to have some other player walk in and gain VPs by achieving some random goal by finishing it (leaving the players that worked for it with nothing).  It is a mechanic that I've thankfully seen less and less of, but here it rears its ugly head again.  

I think under the right circumstances a there may actually be a realistic multiple path to victory option, but I can't help but feel that the economic pick up and delivery game just doesn't work as well as the guns and colonies game.  The game just isn't long enough for the merchant strategy to take off.  And if they suffer a set back then they really can't crest the growth curve.  

In addition, when you compare the merchant strategy to the guns/colony strategy, when you blow something up you get vps and a bonus module or cube, when you colonize you get vps and a bonus module or cube, now compare this to the merchant strategy where you get some vps (though sometimes not as much).  You can upgrade for a bonus that helps you, but that can cost you from fulfilling, in addition it only gives you a couple more vps.  How can this compare to the bonus module/cube?

The other thing that I found obnoxious is that in order to get super powers you need to collect a set of specific cubes.  Sadly, you can only get specific cubes at specific sites.  Once those cubes are scalped, you have no opportunity to get them until they are passed over and left for you.  So, if only one player builds a brown you can't upgrade unless the cube is left available for you.  There were times where I was fully loaded and needed one cube, but couldn't get it, so I just passed my turns waiting for the no one to take the cube first.  That's so much fun.  There needed to have been a way to trade or buy cubes.

I can't help but liken this to Merchant of Venus.  Sadly for me, this is a dry empty version of it; without the cool usable economy, without the color, and without the variable route planning. All the chrome is great, but it is just too hard to see it used.

Also, there is a serious Blue/Green problem on the fulfillment cards.  In low light it is really tough.

Overall, not a bad space exploration game.  There are some interesting decisions and like the buildup of your ship and empire, but I think that the game's primary problem is that it ends up dragging on toward the end.  I'm also not so sure that there is anything fantastically new or interesting here.

I thought I'd like this more, 'cause it has a lot going for it:
- space-themed
- pick-up-and-deliver
- pretty straightforward rules
... seems like it should be a streamlined, simpler, faster Merchant of Venus (almost).

But after 2 plays, I don't expect to play this much more:
- the games just really dragged on too long. At about 2 hours, they weren't nearly as long as Merchant of Venus. Sadly, these games [i]felt[/i] longer!
- ships seem just too small/limited; I don't like having so few bays where you can put the various modules ... the ship-customization is too tight
- fighting aliens seems to not be worth the effort (of course, I don't bother with the aliens in MoV either)
- the luck of the tile distribution, and a totally random decision about which direction to head out in at the start, is a bit annoying; would be nice if you could move further, or the board wrapped around ... something to improve mobility and make more of the board accessible

I like, nothing very original but a good euro /space theme mix. With 3 players appears to need specalisation.
Nice components, damp damage over stated me thinks

Great theme play.  Easy to learn and play.  A light 3X game with limited tech tree, but no PvP.  Mechanics nothing special.  good filler game.  Components are good - thick modular cardboard map tiles, wood playing pieces, thin cardboard chits, and flimsy player mats.  Artwork is cartoonish, fair at best.  The rulebook is very good, well written and organized with examples.  Game length is just over any hour, which feels right.

Involved but fast moving. Techs, colonies, battling aliens - nice! Lots of paths to take with your starship.
Downsides: mold (blech!) and pieces that are really hard to punch off the sprues without tearing. Bad luck in a fight can really mess you up.

Even though it's plagued by some production quality issues it's still a pretty neat game.  Almost feels like a computer game of exploration and item delivery.  My girlfriend absolutely loves it.  

After playing some four player games I firmly believe that this game is best as a two player game.

I like games with a simple pick up and deliver mechanism, and this contains that.  The 2p game is kind of terrible since one player will go for the delivery route while the other will go for the alien-blasting and colonization route based on the upgrades you get for your early colonies.  I find the colors a bit difficult to distinguish when you have your ship at an opponent's colony picking up a colored resource.

I like the art style.  I prefer the cartoony look to a more realistic one.

Just couldn't get down with this one. Felt 4x-Lite, but it played in a way that seemed slow, even though a 2-player game only took my wife and I about an hour. Much prefer something along the lines of Empires of the Void for this type of game.

A solid game with several viable paths to victory.  I enjoy it a little more every time I play it.  But it's definitely unforgiving, and the graphic design turns me off something fierce.  I just feel weird flying around the galaxy in a ship that looks suspiciously like a pastel dildo, especially when it's powered by cubes of Spam.

Fun but slightly clunky game.  It is pretty unique though as a trimmed down euro pick up and delivery logistics game with some dice combat.  Plenty of different strategic paths to it too.  

TMG's components are shockingly bad though, maybe they only distributed this but didn't produce it?  They usually have solid productions but this one missed the mark a bit.

A fun little exploration/economy game based on competing space-races.

Has some neat elements, and it seems like there are multiple paths to victory.  The random board setup should keep it fresh.

A fun space exploration game.  This game requires a ton of risk management.  If you don't think through what you are doing, and just assume that you'll get lucky, you will lose.  Plan ahead!

Played again after a long time on the shelf.  Feels relatively mechanical.  Actions and strategies don't seem balanced.   You seem to get heavily rewarded for easy things and less rewarded for harder things.

A scaled down Merchant of Venus. You explore and try to find the raw materials needed to bring back to the start and trade in for better equipment. Not as good as Merchants but it works very well.

First play was uninspiring. Maybe this will get another play. Very little exploration or build up of capabilites occured just a boring grab of resources on the Terran side of the board. Were we playing wrong? Reviewed rules and did not see any errors.

This is Starfarers of Catan with a wee bit o' Caylus (you can use other players colonies, they get points) and a wee bit o' Cuba/Puerto Rico (ship off resources for points/money)...the big, fat wooden spaceships are cool but kind of get in the way on the board, fiddly but fun...do not forget that the Terra Prime base sells Shields and recharges them!!!

[b]Won in the Tasty Minstrel Giveaway Contest.  Thanks Tasty Minstrel!  ... but it just wasn't my cup of tea.[/b]

Space Exploration, space ship improvements, pick up and deliver and combat against non-player aliens.  Not a lot of interaction here (you can't shoot each other or gang up on the aliens) but when it happens it usually involves racing for the same goal (the first to buy a tech or colonize a sweet spot).  A bit long and samey for my tastes... but could be a solid game for the right group.

Possibly underated. It certainly is fun and scratches that 4X itch in a light(er) game way.

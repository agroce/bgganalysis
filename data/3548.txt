A great game, especially considering it's a Star Wars game from the eighties. Simple hex-map wargame, activation order is randomised by the action deck, and the Empire is in a race against time to get its walkers near enough to  destroy the shield generator. Lots of dice to roll, but there's strategy to think about too, and it's fun, thematic, and seems tight and well-balanced.

The best game in the W.E.G.'s Star Wars series. Balanced (although the ATATs are very strong as in the movei, after all), funny, easy to learn, high replayability.

Before the SW miniatures arriving this game was one of the best SW board game simulation. Many interesting elements: speeders with harpoons, unstoppable ATATs, Luke's Force powers and unpredictable events. Wonderful 6-sided dice with Darth Vader face and Lightsaber. Today should have be edited with plastic miniatures and it should become a bestseller. Funny!

Got this when I was much, much younger. I thought I had lost it, but I found it this past weekend! I had many plays when I had it, but I'll start fresh here.

However, I'm sure I'm missing a few of the action cards. I'll have to figure out what I'm missing.

Can't wait to play again - I remember it being a huge blast!

EDIT: Looks like I have all the action cards!
EDIT 2: Yup, just as much fun as I remembered!

Assault on Host is a good light strategy game.  There are a lot of moving parts in the beginning until units start falling.  It a fun play if you get into the theme and have fun with the dice rolls.  Just don't expect them to be kind.  Worth a play.

Major "Star Wars" battle interpreted through 80's light wargame rules results in a very satisfying combo.  Pioneered some cool card-based turn order mechanics.  Like many other games of the day, the counters look cool but the components aren't built to last.  A fun diversion.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In my opinion, the best of the West End Star Wars boardgames.  The clever card activation for the various unit types during the course of a turn works very well and keeps the suspense up--you know that the faster units will activate more often, but not exactly when.  The stand-up pieces give the game a bit of a miniatures feel. Games are almost always tense and down to the wire.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is what I expect from a war game.   Heavy on the theme, light on rules, and ultimately fun.   You can't beat an evening of Imperial walkers crushing rebel soldiers, Luke using the force, and rebel transports flying away as the power generator shield barely holds up against blast after blast.   Sometimes you just want to blow stuff up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So I may be crazy here, but I found this to be an incredibly fun game for the level of simplicity. Certainly an overlooked gem.
 
When I say easy, I mean easy. Much simpler than M'44 for sure. You don't actually manage a hand, you just draw off a common deck for activation. There is no need for LOS rules on the snowy plains of Hoth. 
 
The two sides are unique: hulking AT-AT's, zippy speeders, rebel troops that pop in and out of underground tunnels, laser towers, the whole bit. The game also has a built-in clock, where you draw twice from the event deck until the fifth transport ecapes the Rebel base. Brilliant design choices all around.  

Despite its simplicity, you do make some decisions, though not as many as I'd like. There's the hitch I guess: if you can handle the fact that it uses "chit-pull" activation then this game will be great. If not then you will find it a random waste of time. 
 
Overall I'm in the camp that finds this a superb mini-game in a big box, and recommend it to everyone who can be talked into piloting a snow speeder.

Quite a decent simple wargame, but not that much replayability I suspect. Having said that it has been a real hit with my two sons (aged 12 and 10) who often request it and really enjoy it. Each side, and the individual units, play differently and it feels quite cinematic.

The Force is strong with this one! If there ever was a Star Wars game which captured the feel of the movies pretty well, it's Assault on Hoth! Relentlessly advancing Imperial troops rushing against badly armed Rebels... who will win? The Rebels, escaping narrowly with the 5th transport from icy Hoth, or the Empire, destroying the Shield Generator before enough can escape? Can Luke's Snowspeeder and the Force turn the tide? Find that out you will. 

Sidenote: upgraded with Lego minifigs and SW PocketModels instead of the rather bland cardboard tokens in the game really makes it even more awesome! That's why I gave it a 10 instead of a 9.

This game doesn't just have "Star Wars" written on it - it certainly IS a Star Wars experience.

Love this game, pretty simple and love Star Wars. We also play with miniatures which mini's always add to the game. There is nothing like the big walkers moving down the board. It kind of brings me back. It is really a dice fest, if you can get by that it is a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It's a nice simulation of the famous battle, but it's a poor game due to the victory conditions. The (random) location of the final transport card all but determines the winner -- if it's early, the Rebellion wins easily; if it's late, the Empire does. If you're lucky, it will be placed "just right" and you'll have a tense game that's won by the better player.

This is a good game.  One that probably deserves to be resurrected. The components are cardboard on stands and a very cheap deck of perforated card stock that looks like they came from a specially marked cereal box.  The board, by contrast, is well laid out and thought out.  Its perimeter contains areas to place all your off-game units.  All units move 5 spaces when it's their turn.  But, the fast stuff gets more move turns than the big slow things.  Same idea with weapon firing.  there is a deck of cards that is populated with the movement cards and firing cards for all units in the game and you draw from this deck on card at a time.  When depleted, you shuffle and start all over.  Primarily, one of the players select 1 card from this deck at a time.  Thus, a unit moves or fires when the appropriate card is pulled.  This deck also contains 1 card which directs you to draw from the 'Event deck'.  The event deck is where something 'eventful' happens. This event deck contains 5 cards that indicate an escape shuttle is launched.  The Imperial player must destroy the shield generator before the 5 shuttle is launched, otherwise the rebels win.  One last thought as I played, I noticed how terribly ineffective laser fire is in this game unless used at very short ranges which appears to be right in line with the movies, considering how much random laser fire seems to be flying around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
this is nice and relatively light. if you know someone who likes star wars and you want to wargame with him/her, this is the way to go.

the rules are simple and straight forwar and quite logical. everybody who has seen the movie will probably quickly understand what his units can do and what good tactics are about in this game.

also very suitable for play with kids 9 upwards. the theme is quite cartooney in fact, so moralic objections also are low.

RATING: 8
The best of West End’s Star Wars games from the ‘80s and one of the better games from that decade.  The game’s most interesting feature is a randomized sequence of play accomplished through a card deck.  I’ve never really settled on the balance question; my current feeling is that the game is balanced with an experienced Imperial player.  It’s a fun game that plays quickly and brings out a decent Star Wars feel.  The narrative quality of the game is merely okay, however.  The Rebels outnumber the Imperials, which seems odd.  And the great moment in the movie where Luke destroys the walker single-handedly cannot occur in the game.  Also, the snowspeeders are strangely tough to kill and can hover behind the walkers like helicopters.  Followed by the solitaire sequel Battle for Endor.

Played this game once in 1995 and I've wanted to play it again ever since. I finally got a copy after years of wanting to play again and loved it just as much!  Although, I did play a guy who lost badly as the empire. The goal is to destroy the Rebels or get out the "6th transport away!" before the Imperials can destroy the shield generators. This game really requires luck and strategy to win with either side. The game was also one of the first war games to include "Events" way before it was trendy.

I love this game.  The game allows you to recreate 9 minutes of cinematic Star Wars battle on Hoth's ice terrain.  I have pimped my version of the game out with in scale miniatures of everything from the shield generator to the AT-AT and AT-ST's...to the speeders and the Golam laser cannons.  We have played this 10 times and the Rebels have won 5 times and the Imperial Forces have won 5 times so it is very evenly balanced and not all that complex.  The pieces that come with the game are good....but cardboard that does not last all that well.

A little tough on the Imperials but a very easy game to pick up and start playing. (the randomization of the turn sequence makes it particularly easy for a new player since he won't have to concentrate on all his units at once). The graphics are attractive, the situation familiar.  A winner in my opinion.

Based on the opening battle in Empire Strikes Back. The game is pretty easy-to-learn but manages to capture the feel of the battle well enough. One player plays as Rebels and tries to stop the inexorable push of the Empire forces. The other player is the Imperial player trying to destroy the Rebel's shield generator.

Its a good game, albeit a bit simple, and the mechanics are quite innovative for its time. Randomness does play a big part of the game though, so players have to be prepared for huge swings in the game.

Way ahead-of-its-time wargame using an intuitive, self-explaining card-driven system that doesn't detract from the strategic possibilities. A gem.    Update: Played it again, and though I still think it was ahead of its time, I now see a mix of mostly great mechanics (the action & event decks, iconic dice) with some disappointments (die roll modifiers). I traded mine away, despite my high rating, because I wasn't sure if I'd continue to play it with my son. Queen's Gambit is the Star Wars boardgame for his generation.

Fun game that succeeds because it tells a good story.  It's a light tactical assymetrical war game.  Imperials versus the Rebels (as I'm sure you've already guessed).  It's basically a race... the Imperials are trying to slog through Hoth with their AT-AT's to destroy the Shield Generator before the Rebels get 6 transport ships away (which are event cards).  It's one of those games that could probably take 45 - 180 mins depending on swings of fate, tactical manuevers and use of the force (especially with the dice).

Of the 4 West End Star Wars Box games, this is my favorite.  Definitely a light war-game, as your actions are determined initially by the draw of a card.  Still, it's the best board game recreation of the movies out there, and there is some strategy needed.  The combat system is simple, and can be a little frustrating at times (as it seems the odds for hitting are rather low against certain units...AT-ATs), but it works.  And you can definitely get "into" this game, it's a great recreation of the battle, and lends itself to some role playing (you can't help but chuckle when an AT-AT walks over a trooper).  Buy it on Ebay, you'll like it.

Light wargame with a great theme. Actions are dictated by card draw--All Rebel Troops Move or All Imperial Walkers Fire--works like a chit draw.

Overall, this game feels like the Battle of Hoth and is a keeper.

big disappointment.  I thought this was supposed to be an upgrade from Battle of Endor.This is a digression. Very luck driven with dice and cards but also drags with both player just wishing for it to end. Seems really unbalance toward the rebel player and way way too long.

Very fun game, appealing to Star Wars fans like myself.  No replay value, as it's the same game every time.

Card driven Empire Strikes Back. The range system with area-hexes is very good.
The art on counters is great. Simple and enjoyable, recreates perfectly the feel of the movie.
I have to get this one from ebay.
Update june 2004: just got it :-) Cool!

Very good wargame simulating the Battle of Hoth from The Empire Strikes Back.  Relatively simple rules and well balanced situation.

Nearly a story telling game because of the repeating action cards and the determined theme about this important battle. An old game but a good one. Maybe slightly too long but very thematic.

Not bad for a movie themed game. I bought it to play with my sons since they wouldn't play historical games.

Not a lot of room for strategy, although there are some tactics to think about.  I like the ticking clock of the "transports away" cards - that was a stroke of minor genius.

Jolly good fun if you can find someone willing to dig in and learn it with you. Reminds me of some of the retro-AH wargames without the utterly onerous realism. Reccommend. Update 10/19/13: Traded! It has found a good home.

RATING: 5
Captures most of the feel of that cinematic battle. Reasonable compromise between flavour (rules heavy) and playable (not rules heavy.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Light treatment of an interesting battle. Some doubts about balance (skewed towards the rebels?). 

Regardless of balance, fails to convey the spirit of the battle, as rebel forces (mainly snowspeeders and their harpoons), besides being numerically dominant, are also insanely more effective than the slow walkers. Unless I'm not getting the game.

Is this anything new or innovative?  Not at all.  But it does an incredible job of recreating the battle for Hoth.  I had so much fun playing this game and would gladly play it any time.  

It would be spectacular to be able to replace some of the tokens with minis although it would cost a fortune.

Willing to trade well for this game.

Fun little game. A little luck dependent, but moves fast. It's a "solid" game - I'm not sure I'd want to play it all the time, but pulling it out now and again is really fun. Plus you get to make blaster noises when you fire.  Pschew pschew!

This went up after my children came of age and liked Star Wars.

I played this a lot with my brother, way back in the late 1980s. Later I got married, and the game stayed with my him. Now I have two kids who are great Star War fans, so I found a decent copy through e-bay and the assault is ready to be fought again on my table...

RATING: 7
Pretty fun game.  I mean, how can you not like a game with stand-up counters of Snowspeeders, AT-ATs, Snowtroopers and Rebel Troopers?  Not to mention dice with drawings of Darth Vader and light-sabers on the sides.

A bit luck-driven in the draw of action and event cards, but quite fun nonetheless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Surprisingly fun and, what seemed to be, pretty balanced.

Odd that the Rebels should be able to win by killing everything in a scenario that's about them hanging on long enough to escape, but perhaps that was a consequence of sub-par playing on the Empire's part.

As much as I've grown to hate Star Wars, and all things SW related, this game does a decent job of capturing the feel of the movie scene(s) and was good to play. I can see this being reprinted as it has aged really well.

Disclaimer: You absolutely have to be okay with throwing tons of dice.

Just played my first game of Assault on Hoth. What a lot of cheesy, fast fun! 

My speeders just couldn't keep up with(!) my wife's Imperial walkers - they kept escaping the harpoons just in the nick of time!

Now I am going to have to (attempt to) play my Japanese Tsukuda Hobbies Assault on Hoth game!  (aka "Panzerblitz on Hoth").

I played this and probably won't do it again. I never thought, I'd say this, but this is just like Risk, but longer and even more tedious. Only you have some special cards to make the game more "exciting". What the game is really good at though is capturing the authentic "targeting-disease" occuring in the movie, which resulted in the infinite number of laser beams shooting through the air not hitting anything. In this game, it's even worse. In the beginning I was thrilled and hoped for that lucky shot, but it u-turned very soon and I only felt bored that I had to throw the dice again. Not only is the luck all decisive in battles, but also in drawing the cards. Often you get cards in exactly the opposite order several turns in a row, which is quite frustrating when your opponent on the other hand draws exactly what he needs when he needs it. So this game isn't pure luck, it's pure luck square merging the two biggest luck factors (or should I say luke-factors? MUAHAHA) in just one game. Some might say you get a lot of luck out of this game. I'd rather stay with an also luck-driven Star Wars-game, which takes about 1/10 of the time and I personally enjoy by far more. Disturbing also the cheapass "cards" included (german WDS edition)

Easy rules, which allow fast gameplay and still leave enough possiblilities to make it fun. A bit too much in favor for the rebel player. But simply moving the pieces and watching the battle unfold is fun!

Pretty fun - not as good, considering that Queen's Gambit is out, but still a good game.  My only quibble is that the Rebel's seem to have a bit of an advantage - which shouldn't really be the case, considering the massive odds against them.

This sounds like the game mechanics are very similar to Battle for Endor, but without Ewoks and with cool at-ats. I bought a copy from England for ~$35 US. Not sure if it's complete. Similarly, ugh, I bought another copy on eBay in the US. Same story. I need an accurate contents list so I can figure out what's what and see what I have.

Cluster your towers for the defense at your base.  The Empire just needs to funnel all its ATATs to your base for a quick victory.  I found this out the hard way one day, and only got ~2 transports away before the final slaughter.

The Star Wars theme is great and the game plays fairly well. It just takes a bit too long with too little action going on. Especially the beginning is sluggish. Also, the board is just a thin paper, so it doesn&#039;t behave nicely. Well, it is an old game and it is still Star Wars!

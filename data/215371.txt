What a fun game!  We know one of the developers, so we purchased the game, partly as support, but we are a gaming family too, so we're always looking for a good game. We have a variety of ages, from 8-17 and everyone enjoyed it!  We did have to make clues a little more obvious for the younger ages, but I look forward to playing with other adults to try being a little more strategic.  

We own codenames as well, so we thought it would be just like that, but there are definitely twists to the game, especially since you're working towards the same goal. Lots of fun!!

For me, this game had the extreme misfortune of coming out just after Word Slam, which I think takes a similar idea (getting clues from the other team) and doing it in a preferable way.

In a small way, I think CrossTalk requires slight more carefulness and cleverness by the clue givers, but at the expense of players sitting around doing nothing for most of the game while the clue givers think of clues. This, vs. Word Slam where teams have to be a bit careful to not give the other team too much information, but plays in real time where there's always things ideas being generated, guesses being shouted, and is just overall a more fun and exciting atmosphere.

So, at the end of the day CrossTalk is a neat game, but just got trumped for me by another game, to the point where I doubt I'd play CrossTalk again due to the preferable alternative.

CrossTalk is the party game of subtle conversation in which two teams race to guess secret keywords. Each round, teams select a clue-giver, and those clue-givers are given knowledge of the same secret keyword. The goal of the clue-givers is to help their teammates guess this keyword before the other team.

The round begins with both clue-givers writing a one-word clue to give their team in private. Then, clue-givers will alternate providing one-word public clues to everyone — but there is a catch! After your team gives a public clue, the other team — and only the other team — may attempt to guess the keyword. Clue-givers will need to use their private clue to provide context for the future. This will allow them to slip public clues by the other team.

Such a neat twist on a guess the word type game. The balance between giving your team enough information to guess without giving it away to the other team (who guesses first) is such a cool element.

Fun interesting party game with more strategy than other party games.

RATING: 8
 - This is a cool team party game.
 - A great next step after Codenames.
 - Most of my friends prefer this to Codenames, for mostly the same reasons why I like it more.
 - It's easy to tailor the difficulty of a round, and hence usually the time a round takes. This is pretty handy depending on who's playing and how late it is.
 - It often results in tense and exciting moments. Sometimes you're sure the other team knows, when they don't. Or maybe they do, and you're gutted they got there just before you. Sometimes someone expertly deduces something from very little clues, which is awesome. Lots of great moments.
 - Some players like that this is less in your face than Codenames, with players mostly communicating in whispers or on their boards.
 - Trying to guess what clues the other clue-master might have given, in order to outplay them is fun and interesting.
 - Teaching is easy, but the game is a little more complicated than Codenames. Leave the bonus clue board (with the symbols) out for the first one/two games, then add it in. It's a cool tool for clue-masters to use to help steer their team closer or the opposing team away. 
 - I don't know why this game is so low rated. If you like Codenames, get this, and unless you're playing with your Grandparents, or with only 4 players, play this instead!

RATING: 7
This is a great party game, works very well at higher counts (6 or 8 players have both gone well for me). Unique system where each team has a clue giver that gives hints about the word that you have to guess, you start by giving your team a private clue to help them. But the catch is that the other team gets to guess first whenever someone gives a clue. Makes you want to be as vague as possible and give clues only your team would understand. Definitely use the sand timer though, because otherwise teams can take way too long to make a guess.

Somebody has managed to find a way to integrate elements of the short-lived game show "Stumpers!" into a party game.  Will take a couple of plays, but there's some fiendish strategy and thinking required with this one.  What's the private clue that's going to hone it in for my teammates and allow me to give vague clues that are useless for the opposing team but really helpful for mine.   Highly recommended if you like word communication games like Password or Codenames.

Only got to play a couple of rounds so far, but this is right up my alley. The subtlety of the strategy in word choice is more interesting than I expected (which may sometimes make for a slow game, like Codenames). I love how - unlike Codenames - teams can be thinking/discussing when it is the other team's turn, as the other team's clue is also a clue for your own team.

I like word connection games (like Codenames) but I find games like Word Slam frustrating because I feel you need to know what words are available in the card stacks. This game has a lot of similarities with Word Slam but it is less frenetic and it is freeform in the clue words that can be used. The clue card makes the game something of a cross between Word Slam and Concept.

Similar to Codenames but I enjoy the extra level of difficulty added by trying not to give the opposing team too much info without knowing what their secret clue might have been.

It's just a "guess the word" game with a small twist of using the other team's clues to guess the word.  The game is very simple.  Not usually a party game fan but this one for whatever reason turned out to be a lot of fun.

Comparable to Codenames. Personally, I like Codenames slightly better because it's easier to guess words you can see and it can be faster-paced than CrossTalk, but I like how CrossTalk adds more depth to the genre with complicated keywords and the Hint Board. It's also a bit easier for first time clue-givers to get into the game.

I expected more boisterous yelling in a game with Crosstalk as the title, but it is actually a fairly quiet, thoughtful, and mild-mannered party game.  Trying to give clues that don't give it away to the opposing team is fun and interesting.

Initial impressions are very good.

The rules are simple, but when it comes to giving good clues there is a steeper learning curve than Codenames. For example, our secret clue was "wars" and the opposing team's first public clue was "religious" so that round immediately ended when we correctly guessed The Crusades. In Crosstalk you don't always want to give the best clue, since it will help both teams, and you want to try to think ahead for how to best use your private clue board.

We're still figuring out how to best approach the game, and while it's not as good as Codenames, I can see this getting plenty of plays.

We have played over 100 games since we have received the game.  It has replaced Codenames for my group.  It takes a lot more thinking and there is far more group interaction than with Codenames.  You have to think ahead because you may give a clue that someone else can use to win.  this is an excellent game and will have a lot of plays.  If we run out of words to guess, I am going to steal them from Codenames

This was a game that I picked up at Gen Con in 2017. Within minutes of playing the demo I knew how enjoyable this game would be. I could instantly picture playing it at our game nights. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a slightly more sophisticated party game. It's like if Outburst was invented today by a company that's in touch with the dynamics that players demand, such as infinite replayability and bluffing or deceit.

(Revised comments; now a 10) Have played several sessions of this game now.

Some games have gone down to the last round (winning 5-4; losing 5-4). Everyone seems to love this one. People slowly get into the indirect clue-giving, hastily scribbling answers on the chat boards and laughing a lot. Even people who think they are "bad" clue-givers do great. Advanced boards have been used a bit, but I don't think they're mandatory; more of a variant.

There have been some rounds that were figured out very quickly, and some went down to the final clues. Great stuff. Nice deluxe boards, too.

About the only downside is that there can be some AP, so we did institute the timer a bit, which helped. Also, people who don't like clue-giving may still shy away from this one.

Again with crazy prices for a simple word game.  I really wanted this one, but I'm guessing I'll never see a copy.  And I bet you in 2 years people will still be playing Codenames (and buying it's expansions/variants) while people won't even remember this one..  All because of the ridiculous price point.  Heck, you can buy Codenames AND Say Anything (for the whiteboards) together for cheaper than this, and you can play all 3 games.  I'll wait for the bargain bin on this one... probably won't take long.

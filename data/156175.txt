I owned Speed Circuit for a while about thirty years ago, but didn't enjoy it very much.  So I wasn't very excited when invited to play this updating of it. Speed Circuit felt too deterministic and the bookkeeping was a bit tiresome.  CFR replaces the bookkeeping with cards and chits that make set-up and play a tad quicker.  It also introduces an element of luck for those prepared to push it.  Managing wear and skill points, appreciating where and when to spend them to best effect are the heart of the game.  CFR plays quickly and smoothly and offers plenty of decisions, particularly when there are cars in close proximity ahead and behind yours.  I was happily surprised.

Production quality is good and the artwork is decent.  The one gripe is with track spaces a little too small for the cars.

I played Speed Circuit to death in both its 3M and AH versions. This is a good successor with nice updated flavor. The pit stops and tire choices reflect Formula 1 decisions very well.

A tremendous progression on the rules from Speed Circuit - a definite must have if you were a fan of the original, or like auto racing games in general.  Withheld the perfect 10 because of the inconsistent size on the track movement spaces issue.

Except for the problem with the cars not fitting on the boards, this is a very good racing game with very little randomness (only tests where you try to exceed your limits).  Recommended.

I got the retail version with the 12 cars and four tracks.  The cars are a little too big for the tracks but on the plus side, you don't need a 4'X8' space to play like you do with formula D.  Game play is hard and the strategy level is good.  A little easier to understand the Formula race 90.

I have been playing this evolution of Speed Circuit for years - it's the rule set that is used at the World Boardgaming Championships.  Highlight of that convention for me.

Speed Circuit was my favorite racing game of all time, but finding enough to play it was impossible.  This lets me play with many fewer people.  Doug's changes are great.

Great Great game!! Just wish that the Publisher was taking it more seriously! The retail edition is lacking a lot of stuff that you could get on the KS and this is if you are lucky to find a Retail copy :/

Please Ultra PRO give this game the respect it deserves!!!

Still a solid racing game, but other than updated components, this is largely the same game as Speed Circuit. Because of this, I'm left a little disappointed. I'm glad that more people will get to experience this game, as it's still my favorite car racing system I've come across, but I was hoping the rules would be streamlined a bit. If the idea of a racing game with minimal luck sounds good to you, this is the one to check out.

A refresh of a 1971 design where the USP is that you 'build' your own car for each race. This is a good and a bad thing: the former so that you can tailor your car to the circuit; the latter because inexperienced players can take themselves out of the game before the first turn (which is what happened to a couple of our eight players, who gave themselves minimal acceleration). Otherwise, it's a simple racing game (racing line blobs excepted) similar to Formula D, but with a more control over your movement. Champion!

I love this game (and its predecessor Speed Circuit) so much.  It is one of the very few games that I consider to be perfect.  My only problem with this printing is the size of the tracks compared to the cars.  Whoever was responsible for that was taking stupid pills that day.

Also own Speed Circuit Avalon Hill and 3M versions. This is a much more refined implementation.

Nice update to classic Speed Circuit. This is my "go to" for racing games, and the new rules are essentially the ones used at WBC for SC. Driver ratings, the 2d6 charts, and force passing encourage more risk taking that basic SC, and I'm looking forward to trying pit stops and historical drivers.

The components are light years ahead of the original but could have been better. The new tracks are clean and function, though a little small. I'm disappointed in the mismatch of car sizes to the boards, but it's not really a deal-breaker.

KS edition. 

This game is an improved remake of Speed Circuit. Each player has a deck of cards to build his car along six dimensions (start speed, acceleration, deceleration, top speed, wear and skill) with trade-offs involved. Wear and skill tokens can be bid for pole position and then spent during the race on various risk-taking decisions. Unlike in Formula DÃ©, there is no randomness involved in how far you can go. You choose a speed and you move that much. Of course if you push your car beyond normal specs, move too fast in corners or attempt to pass en force (and especially if the other tries to block you) your car accumulates wear and or you may end up spinning or even crashing. I crashed after completing the first turn, having built a car with a great starting speed that I didn't get to use as I got blocked at the start and little deceleration capability. Bad car design. Good game design.

We had a group in the Detroit, MI area in the 1980s/90s that used to play "Advanced" Speed Circuit. We are now starting a new group in the Detroit area (mid-2017), but will use the CFR rules (which are just about the same as our old ASC rules). We are looking for folks in the metro Detroit area to join us. We will play at various local game stores.

I love racing games. I owned Speed Circuit years ago, got Formula De when it came out and had about a dozen tracks for it. Sold that years ago. This looks a bit better. More like Speed Circuit. The game has very nice components and the rules look clean and simple. Looking forward to getting a racing league put together. Rating may go to 9 after a few more plays. First game was great.

RATING: 9.5
Absolute best with larger fields (~10) which can be found in local leagues, cons, & PBEM. The Speed Circuit core is still there but with Doug's rules enhancements, new tracks (available at his website), and historic drivers, this game excels.

It would be rated a ten but for the much-maligned car sizing issue. Although that's a non-issue for the leagues & cons which generally use blown up tracks and matchbox size cars.

Pity for the not-so clear rulebook and slightly oversized cars, otherwise it would defenetly be a 9 (And with more Historical Drivers and tracks, it would hit a 10)

RATING: 7.5
I enjoy this, and the racing is close and tense, and plays out like an F1 simulation more than any other racing game I've played. So why only 7.5? Well, the rules are really badly written, and it took me a long time reading through, checking forums, and watching videos to actually get to grips with how the game works. This isn't always an issue, but actually here the rules are really really simple, it is just that the rulebook makes them look really complicated.

Loved and play lots of the 3M version Speed Circuit.  Championship Formula Racing adds additional car setup options.  The Historical Drivers offer options for solo play which I really can use.  Here's hoping that additional tracks and Historical Drivers can be made available for this.

9 for solo play with the historical racer bots.  Guessing at 7 to 8 for multiplayer play.

I *really* like the strategy/tactics of the bots (called "historical racers") in this game. Each has a preferred strategy depending on the difficulty of the track. Each strategy has 5 phases (early race, late race, after 1st/2nd corner, whether they have excess or little/no wear left). 

Each phase has different tactics depending on die roll. The tactics/phase is reevaluated after each corner. You compare the tactic rule symbols against ones on the track section for the car, to find a matching set and use that. That determines the speed and how much wear the driver will use in the upcoming corner this turn. 

It really gives the historical racers characters, at least until they run out of wear. I like it better than Race Formula 90 in that way, because it is much quicker to determine the bot's speed. So it allows for more bots to be on the track, which is good. Still, I need to play both again to compare, since I just played RF90 once without any of the advanced options except pitting. (I didn't bother with pitting in CFR.)

I have minor complaints about the production - poor color choices for track dividers and the rest related to how I wish the board were larger:
1) Cars don't fit Monza well, but do fit Monte Carlo. Monza board was added later in the KS and likely the board size was already set by that point so track spaces ended up more shrunken than originally planned. (The CFR board is about 3/4 the size or the original Speed Circuit 4-section board. The CFR board's Monza track spaces does fit the Speed Circuit cars very well.)
2) For the bot tactic control sections printed alongside the track: 
(A) The font is readable, but I wish it were slightly larger font. (I think it is size 10.)
(B) The dividing lines delineating the bot tactic control sections is so faint I didn't notice it until into the 2nd corner.

Overall I am very happy so far with this for solo play. TBD regarding multiplayer play, since I need to play it multiplayer which might be a couple months until that happens.

This is is a fun game especially if you add some of the variant rules. The figures are not quality pieces but you get a ton of them.

The templates that you place on the bases is a novel addition and gives the game a freash feeling.

The number one thing going for this game is that you can pick up the figures CHEAP! My sone and I have purchased hundreds of figures just for that reason.

If you don't play with the templates you can uses the figures and bases for many other wargame rules.

On a side not, I've discovered something very cool. If you take a flat piece of Lego 8x2 or8x whatever the 8 pips equial a DBA stand almost exactly. Ifyou turn the Lego piece over the figures little sockets fit perfectly in the holes on the bottom of the Lego piece! So you can use 8xwhatever flat lego pieces to mount the figures and play DBA! Or mount them in any number of configurations for whatever rules you happen to be playing!

It looks like a good miniature game. The story, although nothing really new, is quite good in my opinion. The miniatures are nice, above average, although a bit too small for the 25mm scale. The rules are nice, maneuvering is very important, ranged attacks are devastating (as it always happened to be) and the idea of regroup is excellent. Full of good promises, I hope it will keep up the good work.

Very innovative, but it's not holding my attention.

The base scenarios need to be tweaked in order to avoid problems with cavalry and archery dominating the battlefield.  I currently play with the restriction that archers are not allowed to push to shoot.

Once you purchase the additional booster packs and army packs, this game really becomes an enjoyable miniature army game.  Granted, it's the only one I have ever played, but I love the mechanics.  Yes, archers are very powerful (I read this as one of the major complaints).  But everybody can have them, so nobody is at a disadvantage as far as options go.

2 player starter set.  Box has some small dents and shows shelf wear.  All pieces are present and accounted for.  Three leaders and shields are already painted by the manufacturer, but there are 120 more figures to paint if that's what you're into.  Good shape.

Only played the demo sets, but it seems too light weight for me.  Everything thing is tied to the bases so movement and strategy is limited.  Re-arrange the figures on the bases is mostly an obvious in battle decision (more attack dice when attacking, more defense when defending).

Mediocre. Almost every other instance of game in the 'ancient battle genre' is better than this. 

The peg and base system means you will spend alot of time watching figures fall out of their holes and then you will argue with your opponent as to where the figure was. The plastic is very bendy and as the figures are to scale they are very thin and will bend and warp. The scale is overly large with the size of table being 4' x 6' and the fact that you start on the narrow side means that games are longer than they need be as you try to get into position.

The action system means your huge army will have to be grouped together or you will get absolutely nothing done...imagine 15 bases of troops in a game where you can only issue 3 orders...bleh. Especially considering that a melee unit will move for one order...and then use another order to fight in melee...

I have played this around 10 times now, and I have got to say that I won't ever be playing this again. If you want a better game search 'De Bellis Antiquitatis' 'Command and Colors Ancients' 'Warmaster' or even 'Field of Glory' cuz this game stinks on ice.

Played several rounds with the demo units. Too early to say more than the system has a lot of promise and the regroup rules are solid.

One note that had me bothered since I saw the videos and played it myself...Ranged Attacks are DEVASTATING. Terrain will tone it down, but at the expense of Maneuverability.

I am interested to see how this develops.

Even knowing how nasty the Han Dynasty "bow hunting skills" are I bought Romans...we'll see how this goes...

The verdict is in! after less than one year this game is on life support waiting for someone to pull the plug...I went one step further and tossed mine in the garbage, very cathartic and satisfying.

The guy who rated this game a "1" saying: "Scotty we have a party of 4 ready to beam up. No intelligent life in this design." is dead wrong. Perhaps He actually does live on a different world.

This game has alot of Intelligent game design. I especially like how flexible your units are, able to change their attributes by taking on a new formation. 

Fun game that I played at PAX. Cant wait to see more from this game, and im hoping that they eventually offer pre-painted infantry/starter packs!

Fun little miniatures game. The system is great but the Game feels a little soulless and looks like crap. It is superbly designed but one of the draws of a minis game is the flavor, the story, and the bits.  This game is lacking in those areas.

Some interesting concepts added to a somewhat "traditional" miniature setup.  Me thinks they tried to hard . . . or not hard enough.  Pre-painted or not?  Make a decision.  The special abilities on the base is nice nuance.  Do not be fooled--this is not a "gateway" to miniature play, it IS miniature play IMHO.  Albeit not as extreme as other offering in the genre, there are all the trappings--sprues, assembly, painting, special rules, etc.  If you want a "gateway" mini game, get Heroscape.

Excellent little minis mass combat system, the rules as they stand require a bit of tweaking, mainly to correct the author's rather wierd view of archery.

There's a descent, fun game hiding in here, but it will take some coaxing to come out.  The rules and scenario design out-of-the-box are fairly broken, resulting in battles where infantry has little relevance to the outcome.  House rules will abound for awhile to fix this.  

After this settles out, should be a good game.  The innovations are fun and the total package quite reasonable for a minitures game.  It just needs some rules tuning and revamped scenarios.

I was given a free starter set of this game. I opened it up and found a bunch of 'ok' minis inside. The commanders came with average prepainted jobs. It had some bizzare type of peg boards and cardboard overlays for specific unit types inside. The peg boards kinda bugged me but I decided to read the rules and seek out others who may be interested in engaging in battle. 

Try as I might I could not find anyone who had an army and those very few who did usually coughed up some lame excuse not to play or attempted to postpone to somedate far off in the future hoping that I would forget....

Never did end up playing which is prolly for the best.

I think the company that manufactures this game has gone belly up so if you do play and want to increase the size of your forces I suggest you look on ebay as it will probably be available by the pallet load or metric ton.

In the year 42BCE, a mysterious magical force was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. The miasmic shockwave of pure otherworldly magic spread outward from a point somewhere in the middle east, and in a few short hours plunged the entire globe into chaos. In those terrible moments, human civilization changed forever.
\13\\13\
Magic infused their very bones, manifested in their children, came unbidden to the fingertips of their women, and plagued their countryside in uncontrolled bursts of power. Ordinary beasts of the wilderness were turned by these bursts into fanciful creatures of legend. Entire tribes of humans from all corners of the world were altered by the flood of uncontrolled magic, changing before the very eyes of their friends and neighbors into elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, centaurs, and even minotaurs. Creatures that normally existed between our reality and others were shunted into this one, leaving ghosts, faeries, and other magical creatures stranded in our world in ways they were never intended to be. Even remnants of the Old World, gods of the ancients and their ken, were awakened from their immortal slumber through this great cataclysm to trouble mankind once more.
\13\\13\
The year is now 37BCE and the middle-east sits at the center of a vast struggle to control humanity’s fate. Three powerful nations have harnessed the power unleashed by the day of chaos, and they struggle to claim dominance over the known world. Their arcane legions are now yours to control.

Interesting take on miniature fighting. It is a miniature wargame. The base has more positions than figures so you move the figures around and it changes the movement, offense and defense.

RATING: 6
As a non-miniature gamer, there was a lot I liked about this. A clever movement mechanic, strategy in moving troops to different available base positions to activate abilities, and a dead simple way to record troop losses.
Like most miniature games though, there were fistfuls of dice (tiny dice!) and so luck played a large part. There were also a few balance issues, especially if you used the unit creator on the official website.....

There are a few wargames that I like to play, this one is definitely not one of them. To much lucky factors that I simply didn't feel like playing a game, just a game playing me.

The details and some story on the session report could be fun, but not more than that. At least this game is faster than the majority of games in this category.

I'm not much of a naval gamer, but this game allows one to get directly to te "fun" stuff -- hammering away at the other guy!  The system is easy to use and becomes quite intuitive after playing for a while.

This game was a nice addition.  Not your typical naval hex warfare game.  If you hate rolling dice then look elsewhere.  That being said, it models Civil War naval combat surprisingly well. If your an old Ironclads player then you are in for a bit of a shock but its certainly worth picking up a copy.  There have been some snob type reviews out there, that are really not warranted for this game. Its just a different more modern mechanism.  I did feel more invested in the ships in Iron and Oak than I did in Ironclads, and I like the ship cards vs. pencil and log. Both are good games for different reasons.

2015-01-06: Played a solitaire game of Scenario 1.  The game's rules seem really thematic.  I am going to try a few more solitaire games to allow my opinions to firm up, but initial impressions are favorable.  The Challenge/Response concept is novel, but I almost wish they had called it something else.  It seems weird that my opponent can "respond" to my attempt to maneuver from across the map . . . In the initial outing, one Union ship didn't maneuver at all, failing maneuver attempts 6 times in 6 turns.  But so far, I am intrigued.  The rules are complicated to digest, but in execution, it's not too bad.  I wish the player aid had included more of the exceptions on it and/or a fuller explanation of certain phases.  I reviewed the rules after play and I did play a few things incorrectly.  Will attempt to correct for that in the next game.

Relatively light and fun civil war ironclads game. The abstract movement, combined with the action cards, helps create unique combat situations each game.

However, the wristage is quite heavy. Often you're just waiting for the high-low combo that finally damages an ironclad, and then things typically start to go downhill for the ship from there. The maneuvering options are rather limited, too, given the way movement is abstracted.

It's not bad, but it's a little too light and abstract for my tastes. I'd play again from time to time, as the playing time is short at least.

A pretty neat game.  It took a long time to play the intro scenario, but we were both learning the game.  I think it will go faster, and be more fun, next time we play.  Overall, this is a keeper.

RATING: 4
Think this could well be a pretty accurate simulation, but as a game, it seems there's not a great deal you can do except hope that either the enemy breaks down or you get a lucky hit. Once that lucky hit is scored it's pretty much only a matter of time until the ship goes down.

ACW naval ships are intriguing and varied, but it does make me question just how valid they were as weapons.

RATING: 4.5
A total dice fest. Still enjoyable but not really many decisions to be made. They did a good job with the ship cards and the way the dice match up with the different parts of the ship, but in the end you are rolling dice for really everything you could possibly want to do.

after 10 plays, this game is really just a narrative generator, and a not very effective one at that.

I knew going in it was abstract with a just a general grid instead of a hex-based movement, but most of the time, esp. after a bit of damage, you can't move it all.  Once this happens, the only decisions you are making is what to shoot at, and hope you get the high-low dice splits on the same location, with a nice critical roll.  While there are some die roll modifiers that may influence things, it comes down to luck more than anything.

Nice production, clear rules, and I like the theme.  However, there just isn't enough decision making to keep me coming back.

This game is weird. Especially this maneuvering mechanic. Also game is real dice fest. 

I generally like Kaisers Pirates and from rules it seemed to be similar in some respects and main change being change of scale and period. So far it seemed great. But after playing it left me hugely disappointed.

I spent a lot of time trying to salvage the game, and my variant rules improve it quite a bit.  With my variant, I'd give it a higher rating, but ultimately I decided the game wasn't good enough to warrant saving. 

Clue to the designer: no one wants to have a competitive dice rolling contest to see if one even is allowed to move.  It simulates nothing, and is tremendously un-fun.

At last I played this game (2014/Aug). I bought it one year ago but the rulebook scared me. So I saw I had wasted my time until now. It is a great game, with a lot of randomness and thematically dice rolls, but it's funny and strategic until the rolls ruin your dreams!

It has a Campaign / Battle Card Driven mechanic similar to Combat Commander Series but you can freely choose the orders

RATING: 6
It takes too long for the relatively modest number of decisions and amount of fun. 

It captures the feel of fighting ironclads but ends up consuming a lot of time without being all that fun. I like the feel of the combat system of hammering away at armor before being able to do any real damage and the emphasis on critical blows. Then I reach a point and say, "I get it, ironclads. Lets just keep rolling these dice until one of us sinks." 

Kindof a shame because there's a lot there. A lot of battles, a whole campaign system, a scenario generator...

... then again, considering the relatively meager number of naval war games and what they accomplish, maybe I should give it more credit.

Kudos to the designer for tackling a "rivet counter" type subject and making into a playable game.  The system is definitely unique and makes for an interesting game, but like GMT's Nightfighter after a game or two you've pretty much seen everything there is to see.  Very nice components and an interesting topic, but I'm not sure how many times it will hit the table.

RATING: 7.5
A really interesting mix of detail and abstraction.  But most of all the game is FUN to play.  Lots of action, dice rolling, critical hits, dying captains, and enough details to keep it from getting too easy (like a ship taking on water and running deeper, risking grounding).  the movement takes some getting used to, but nice mechanisms to generate 'difficulty' levels for actions, and in this way can really make the ships quite different to each other.  Once things start going bad for your ship, rapid demolition often follows.  Would be interested linking it to Rebel Raiders.  I really like the extremely limited hands of cards: this makes you really sweat the decisions!

A nice light wargame that can easily be played with miniatures on a tabletop. The abstracted mechanics avoid a lot of complexity that's otherwise inevitable in a game that tries to replicate the problems of riverine warfare between (often experimental/unreliable) vessels. Unlike 'Smoke on the Water' (an old miniatures game) you don't actually have to learn how to be a coxswain in order to play this game. There IS a lot of dice rolling which means that you need to know how to manage your risks and when to play the percentages.

The action cards add an extra level of decision making to the game and a lot of period flavour but can seem unbalanced. I'd suggest that when playing with new players you either cull the deck of all the more powerful cards or take the time to explain them to everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game is generally fun and fast moving.  I like that all of the record keeping is done with counters, so no writing.  Roll-counter-roll and cards keep both players involved.  But all the dice rolling and cards can at times seem a little gamey, and the game loses some authenticity IMHO in the process.  The most irritating rule in the game has to do with moving.  Each ship has to roll dice to move.  Failing the die roll, means you don't move.  I have seen games where undamaged ships just can't move for turn after turn.

Played one scenario. You could define this game: dice driven.
You have very few decision to take and a lot of dice to roll; tactics is inexistent and luck is everything you need.
Why a vote of 6.5 and no less? Because I had fun while playing; it could be a good game if you want something light and not mind burning for couple of hours with a good friend and some bottle of beer to drink.

I have played about 10 scenarios all solo so far. It is a fun game with some interesting mechanics. Lots of die rolling as almost everything uses the challenge response mechanism. Some of the scenarios seem impossible to achieve the historical result. 

All in all a fun light ship to ship combat game.

I really do want to love this game. The components are excellent, particularly the ship counters and cards. The opposing die rolls for attack and defense work well, and there was more detail in the damage system than I expected. That said, I'm not fully sold on the abstract/opposed movement just yet. I wanted a less granular version of Ironclads, but this one may be a little too abstracted.

While I believe that this game could rival Panzer as a must play game for me, I must admit that the rule book has issues. They aren't crippling issues, but the central mechanic of rolling various dice for challenges is obscured within its organization by sequence of play. I feel like I have half to three quarters of a book. Still...I am more than willing to give this game a chance. As much as I love Panzer, I think that this game might be even better. We'll see if the rating rises in the weeks and months to come.

At first I was a bit frustrated with all the die rolling but... As I play this game it turns out it is super fun. And very thematic. 
Not for "rivet counters" yet the results seem to to nicely line up with reality. I'm giving it a 9 because there s so much variety to game play and there is a huge amount of scenarios between the hstorical ones and the campaign ones.

I would not classify Iron and Oak a detailed game on American Civil War naval combat but more as an abstraction. If one is looking for that type of game I would not recommend Iron and Oak. If you are looking for a casual, introductory, and not so complex game on the subject then Iron and Oak would be the type of game you are looking for. One has to realize movement the ships is being abstracted and also the combat. Both movement and combat is very luck dependent. If you don't like a lot of dice rolling in your game you probably will not like Iron and Oak.
This aside, I did like the game I thought it was fun to play and seemed to capture the theme of American Civil War combat. Iron and Oak could might be introductory type of game for a veteran gamer teaching a newbie how to play.
I was a bit disappointed with the player aid cards not all the information of modifiers were listed in some parts of the cards so it was incomplete and the CRT section could have been better. It would have been nice to have a bigger ship counters (like the old Avalon Hill ones)but I guess they thought the GB would have been too crowded.

Games that use scenarios are harder to judge when you only know a few of them. I will say what I think about the game, but take the informations for what they are worth.

[thing=62226][/thing] is differentiated because it is focused in ship battles, mostly in rivers, as its theme. Quickly one finds that the ships, during the US Civil War, aren't to be trusted: sailing was hard, the engines were unreliable, mostly of the shots were bad, missing or causing little to no damage, and could even do more harm to the firing vessel than the one they were aiming at - yet, one proper and lucky hit could sink or destroy a whole ship. Most of them were floating boxes of wood and iron filled with gun powder and crew. Yes, some vessels were better, more resistent, manoeuvrable and fit for combat - though even these fearsome ship fortresses could be defeated, be by mistakes, temerity or simply bad luck: for instance, the Atlanta was a confederated ship, very strong - almost all metal -, fast and potent, and it was captured when it was stuck in a shallow bank in the river, unable to escape, attack or defend properly.

The mechanisms of [thing=62226][/thing] try to simulate the conditions above and other situations, such as smoke from firing (or by wood burning), making harder for attacks to hit; passing by the unreliable movement of the ships; and going to single shots that, by skill or luck, could destroy or cause major havoc. This is pretty good, thematically. But isn't ideal as a game.

First because a good chunk of the rules and charts go without use for most - or all, in some scenarios - of the time; yet they are there and take a good amount of the rules, which can push away people interested in the game. The other side of this is that, when explaining the rules, much can be left aside, without loss.

Second because a huge part of the game leaves the strategy and tatics and falls in to pure luck: move depends of a challenged dice roll, the same for firing. Where to hit is decided by a die; the same for what a critical damage will do. While these make thematic sense, this lack of control - knowing what you want to do, but being unable, as the commander's tools were limited and imprecise; the result, in play, is frustration, with the constant failure due to bad rolls, not seeing your plans going forward, or simply taking a critical hit and effectivelly losing.

Third because, naturally, after a while, the play leads itself to repetitiveness. The actions became more and more obvious as time goes by, as some of them basically leave the building, and repetition installs: the ships, as the damage gets bigger and crew is lost, will have a hard time moving or firing. Again, it makes sense with the theme, still the result, in play, is that scenarios with fewer ships became even more a luck fest, with shots with low chances of hitting going around, and ships trying to simply leave the place they are in and not being able. This gets worst when the opposition can't finish things off, as damage is often given in some parts of the ship, while others remain unscathed and with strong defences - and since the place to hit is decided by a die, it is possible to keep hitting a place and doing nothing, specially when the ships are made of metal.

In any case, [thing=62226][/thing] plays, normally, rather quickly, with fast resolution for actions and turns: most scenarios end in around 1 to 2 hours, which is good, specially considering the amount of luck present.

In the end, [thing=62226][/thing] can be fun, with its swings of destiny, which generate cheers, laughter and curses - as when the shot hits the exact place, or when an adversary ships is broken by a perfect ram attack. It isn't a game to be taken all that seriously, in spite of its wargame status, and amount of rules. Yet, when considering all the negatives above, it is complicated to recommend it; and, after adding up positives and negatives, [thing=62226][/thing] ends up failing in being a good game, albeit a very thematic failure.

I found this an extremely frustrating game to play and ultimately not very satisfying. I disliked intensley the large rectangles for movement which didn't model the tactical maneuvers of the period vessels. What really drove me crazy was the dice rolls used for movement. I fully understand that the vessels of the period were extremely tempermental but when you get a 48% failure rate in ship movement the whole system leaves me cold. 

There is definitely potentially a good game in there but I suspect the designer didn't listen to his development team. Ships that just sit there turn after turn is completely boring. The 'ship firing mechanism' that the designer ported over from "Kaiser's Pirates" is half decent, but is burdened by more frustrating sets of die roll modifiers and minutae that ultimately doesn't count for much.

For all that, the maps don't do a thing for this game, it could have been designed as a card game without a board. I'm still waiting for the tactical naval game from the period of the American Civil War. Terrific looking cards and components but the board is extremely dissapointing. This should have been designed with hexes or a smaller grid. Facing doesn't seem to matter much unless at point blank range.

I'm keeping the copy that I have because I think the cards and counters can be salvage to create a different game with hexes. A tragedy in my opinion.

RATING: 6
So so game.  The movement is too abstract and as a result, maneuvering has a much smaller role than you would expect (ends up mostly being range).  Combat is reminiscent of Battletech type games.  I don't mind rolling a lot of dice, but in this game there were not enough other decisions to outweigh the large luck factor.  Many of the cards only apply to specific situations so your hand fills up with useless cards over time.

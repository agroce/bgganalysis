Fiddly, but can be cool with the right crowd. Me, I like my space battle fast and furious. Used (once) for a Star Wars: The Role-Playing Game campaign. I ended up just using the counters on the table to give a general idea of the battle.

The game is very detailed and has the SW feel. Handling of more than 3 craft gets bogged down. The action system makes it more for use on character scale than tactical. It would take years and many players to play the battle on the 1st or second death star. Capital ship rules are fudged in, including only the regular stardestroyer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice starfighter combat game. It has on its side the fact that comes from Star Wars, good game mechanics and the possibility of converting SW RPG ships into boardgame stats. A bit too book-keeping is its downside, however. Overall a 7.

Space combat is a little slow, not for the game itself but for Star Wars tone and style (compared to WEG's RPG which IMO captured this perfectly), but a fun game with a lot of room for expansion (new ships, scenarios, etc.), too. Cap ships could have been done a bit better, though. Nonetheless, a cool game; classic Star Wars by WEG, from the "good old days" of Star Wars (i.e. before Special Editions and Episodes 1-3).

Had a lot of fun with this one during my Star Wars obsessive fan days.  Simple enough system, thematic, good components, though the  stardestroyer "chits" had much to be desired.  Was lots of fun using the West End RPG system for ship to ship combat.  LOVED using the R2 units!  Fun, accessible, lite lite wargame of sorts.

This is a game from my teenage years.  I remember playing once or twice with my brother.  The way you plan your ship's moves and then execute them is a very well done mechanic, and creates the feel of a space dogfight effectively.  Plus, of course, it's Star Wars.

UPDATE 2013: With all the X-wing Miniatures hoopla, and my own recent insertion of that needle into my veins, I found myself looking over Star Warriors.

I was amazed - AMAZED - at how well-written and easy-to-understand those rules are.  I haven't opened the box in 15+ years, but I instantly knew how to play again.  These rules should be a model for wargame instructions.

Also, this was a cool game.  Flat out cool.  I have raised my rating because I can promise you, if it wasn't for the quicker-playing X-wing that I own $300 worth of ships for, I would be playing Star Warriors RIGHT NOW!


This was a great game when it came out for the simple reason that we could finally fly X-Wings and TIEs in combat.

Picked up a copy in my FLGS's used section for $5.00.  I have only played against myself, but the game looks quite promising even though it suffers slightly from over-chart-itis.  I plan to rework the rules and components into something that won't make my gaming group run screaming in terror.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty fast combat game, which well represents the furious pace of the movies.  Asteroid rules are cool, too.  But the dice resolution system is based off the (old) RPG from WEG, so it uses way too many dice for each roll -- at least 2d6 in most cases, and not unusual for 4d6 or even more!  For a streamlined game, just trying to track down where the dice scattered and adding them up bogs it down.

A must for old WEG Star Wars RPGers. I was DM for long and used Star Warriors in my sessions only once, the game itself is so much thrilling we used to play it a lot in its own. Feels like Wings of War with hexes and dice, using Star Wars miniatures is a must as the old counters are sub-par (even for its age).

This is an awesome game in just about every way (a little more fun if you play with the WOTC Starship Battles minis).  It reminds me of Star Fleet Battles, but is much simpler to play. You can play a few ships at once without too much difficulty.  

Extra copy for trade.

RATING: 3
Really Really boring. Overly compexed rules without logic (if a ship won in the film it has to be better). You can rebuild your ship(as Han Solos Milenium falcon that is a medium cargo frighter in original), well it says som but they diden´t bother to put in the rules (when you want to improve a ship you agree about it with your oponent).
The bigger the ship the faster turns (the ship with the fastest turns are the star destroyer, You just turn the front marker and realign the rest).
Has sold it. Hopefully the new owner will have some fun with it.

Too much work to play, particularly when compared with competition like Silent Death.  An additional problem is that it doesn't scale well to the sort of big furballs seen in the movies.  Now that X-Wing is out from FFG, it's hard to imagine ever wanting to revisit this one.

This game really hit the spot - not overly complex rules to play, beautiful counters and hexmap too.

Beautifully produced game with a great theme. Extremely flexible with a good deal of replay value. Only loses marks for a relatively dense rules system which make it difficult for non-wargamers to penetrate initially. Captures the theme, action and style of Star Wars fighter combat very well. I mourn the loss of West End every time I look at the quality of this game, from layout to game play.

Great dogfighting rules for the Star Wars galaxy.  Players determine what manuvers they would like to attempt and then roll the dice to determine success.  The more manuvers you try, the harder it becomes.  Played a great 3D custom version complete with an asteroid field.  Ships used were from the Star Wars miniatures game.  An extremely underrated game.

RATING: 5
Somewhat disappointed upon first blush due to some incongruities that destroy the "fighters in space" feeling, at least in the Basic Game. A half-turn is about ten times more efficient than actually turning, and the initiative rule allows the better pilots to rubberband the worse ones - move close to fire, then the other guy has to move away, rinse and repeat.  

Need to try again with the advanced rules, but the half turns and initiative have to be dealt with.  Also perhaps allow snap fire in the other player's turn.

A pretty good simulation of starship combat in the Star Wars universe.  Designed to be used with the roleplaying game, it can still be played as a stand-alone game.  I really like how the pilot's skill influences the battles.  Good luck finding Star Wars fans who are also gamers to play with...  Works best for small (3-on-3 or so) combats: breaks down for large battles with too much record-keeping.  Star Destroyers only superflously handled, and large-ship combat not included.

When initially released in Australia, it was much cheaper than the other board games.  This game had a wonderful diversity of scenarios, spaceships and firepower.

Movement mechanism was neat and simple, yet surprisingly realistic - amazing since it was in 2D.  I liked the dice nomenclature that provided an enormous wealth of configurations for the spaceships.

A great game.

I've own this game since it first came out and have played many times. Though, I haven't played it in nearly 10 years. Great dogfighting game. The game isn't really suited for large scale dogfights and the game itself says that. But, if you're using up to 3 ships aside its fast and fun. Anything more usually slows the game down a little too much.

It's too bad they didn't have the star wars minis play when I was playing this.

This was a fun game back in the early 90's.  I haven't played it in years.  It does not really simulate fighter combat as portrayed in the Star Wars movies as the Tie fighters can take multiple hits without being destroyed.

Very good game if not a bit long-winded and over-complex in the maneuvers. If the players can keep it simple it's a great game.

Love this game! A bit too complex for a quick game, you really want to devote the time to set it up right - TONS of fun when played as a campaign over a series of sessions.

Tactical location damage tracked combat. Retro X-wing fighting without the minis.

The rules seem very clear and well laid out, and the concepts are interesting. Rather than moves being purely determined by the capability of the spaceship, it's the skill of the pilot that's the main decider. An incompetent pilot can try and do a heap of things but has a good chance of it all going horribly wrong. The hot shot pilot can try the same tasks and is far more likely to succeed. The hardware being used just acts as a limiter, e.g. maximum top speed or damage capability.

Update - got a couple of games in and enjoyed it thoroughly, so now rated.

Excellent Star Wars fighters board game using hexes (though it can be adapted quite easily for minis).

RATING: 7
A lot of nostalgia here, but it does a fine job of simulating the feel of Original Trilogy dogfights, and plugs seemlessly into the West End Games Star Wars RPG (something trivial to me now, but vitally important to me twenty years ago).

This is the only fighter flight sim I've played and enjoyed.  Granted, the others were realistic fighter games.  

I like the sheet of actions adding to the difficulty each round always tempting you to do too much.

RATING: 6.5
Works equally well with 2-4 players.
It can take quite a while to take down a fighter that is playing defensively (rolling and jinking all the time), but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I just got this game not long ago and enjoyed it alot so I am rating it high. I may change my rating later on after I have played alot of games. So far its been a very solid game. I have not played with multiple ships yet so I could raise or lower my rating depending on that.

Played with multiple ships and lower the rank. Its better with only 1 or 2 ships.

Too much book keeping and modifiers and not enough action.  A game like this should play fast.  Traded.

Liked this game a lot.  It went well with the role playing game and as a stand alone.

Two hours to perform maybe 5 rounds. This was for a 2 player game, and only for first blood.

Torturous, tedious, and insipid beyond belief. Nothing but constant referral to the rulebook.

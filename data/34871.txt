Regarding components, this is probably the worst game by FFG that I have gotten my hands on, yet. Very bland looking tiles and very hard to discern plastic components. The cards are nice, however.

The game has some interesting ideas, especially for the placement of the troops and the deterministic combat system but suffers from quite a bit of fiddliness.

Gameplay is quick and fun but money can literally buy you the victory. Having much money unfortunately seems to depend on a lot of luck with the territory tile draw which ultimately feels unsatisfying.

The nature of the open information about the army's composition might lead to a lot of player downtime when playing against people who want to take that info seriously into consideration and not just play fast and loose.

Would probably play again if someone wishes for but will be culled from my collection (box is too big).

Must attempt to play the variant by having the players gaining victory if they achieve 50 points.

I somehow like this comment given by a reviewer which said, "Ventura is about the mercenary and middle nobility wars over territory, control and papal influence in Middle Italy. It covers a similar ground as Condottiere. The only people I know that are fascinated by such a topic besides myself are historians and...well....that about covers it. Most people would rather read about the conflicts between England and France, or Germany and other portions of Europe than anything dealing with the political and military intrigue of the mid second millenia A.D in Italy."  This may be a reason for the lack of popularity of Ventura.  I wonder whether this game can have better reception if it were to be re-themed in a different historical setting or put the gameplay in a hi-fantasy or sci-fi setting.  Perhaps, I can game hack on this and borrow some of mechanics and tweak the tile characteristics.  The problem is that there is no hype about the game as stated by the commentator.

Note to self: It will be interesting also to mesh ideas from Eclipse.

A materially beautiful game, but there is some opacity to the rules, and the victory condition (in a two-player game) can be attained with virtually no conflict, which seems counter to the premise of play.

Wow. Much that is good in this game is ruined by so much more that is really, really bad. The art is good, pieces look great, the tiles are nice, the box is HUGE: it seems like a quality FF package. 

Unfortunately most of the effort you spend building armies--getting your recruiters in various terrains to hire certain units, hiring commanders, mobilizing forces--is wasted because someone can win without having initiated even a single battle. It can be far more lucrative to sit around buying victory points, from money made by drawing tiles for free every turn. 

In fact, it's possible to win this game by literally doing nothing, and it's not unlikely that players will score no more than a handful of points from combat because none had the movement required to recruit more units.

Bad, bad game. Fortunately, I got this for $15 and was able to cannibalize the parts for another game.

I really want to like Ventura.  The setting is well-conceived, the game board and playing pieces are nice, and the rules are not terribly complicated.  But every game I've played of it leaves me feeling unsatisfied.

The game's biggest problem is the fact that money is trivially converted into points -- at a typical rate of 5-7 per turn.  Given that the game is a race to 30 points this makes the game VERY short, and means combat is an almost useless distraction.

With a few house rules Ventura could be a stellar game.  Bordering on Eclipse, but set in Renaissance Italy.  But when played with the official rules the game feels like it falls flat.

So far I've spent about as much time coloring the numbers on the troop markers so the numbers are visible as I have actually playing the game. But that was absolutely necessary. The game is unplayable without that, unless you are Steve Austin and have bionic eyes. 

This feels a lot like stripped-down Eclipse to me. I like this much more. I like how hexes provide not only income (of a simple single type), but also have different costs to move to (a la Mage Knight et al), and also combat bonuses for the defender.  But even with those bonuses, the motivation to attack is huge, and thus people start doing it on the first turn, not the last turn. It is not really possible to turtle, since new hexes get added, it's easy to connect, and it's difficult to afford many armies, as troops have upkeep costs. Troops need to be used or their not worth having. Which to me is what a conflict game should be about.

The only nit is that while it's cool to be able to compose unique armies (via multiple company cards), it becomes difficult to see all the companies in other players armies at a glance, especially with the unfortunate choice to put the icons/numbers in the middle of the cards rather than at the bottom, so you can't easily overlap the cards to see all the stats, and the result is that players have to ask each other to pass their armies over for inspection. Maybe the armies [i]shouldn't[/i] be public, which would obviate the need for that. In a similar vein, combat system is fairly elegant, but completely deterministic (other than whether to retreat mid-combat) based on the two armies once the start positions have been chosen, which is [i]mostly[/i] obvious, especially when you know the opposing force's composition. So before anyone proceeds to battle, there is a lot of checking the opposing force to make sure they can win. This can be a bit tedious, and anti-thematic. So hidden armies would help that too.

Looking forward to exploring this more.

The rule book and player aids are a bit of a mess. I made my own abbreviated SoP. I also painted numbers on the pieces. A rule needs to be added to limit the number of ducats that may be spent on VPs to 2-per-turn. The game is underrated here on BGG.

I really like this game, despite some features that make the difference between a good game and a so-and-so game like this.
What I dislike: Buying victory points weighs too much. The battle resolution is nice, but units with ranged attack are disposable. 
What I like: The player's board is well designed. Thanks to this, this game isn't hard to understand, even if the game turn has a lot of phases.
In the end... the game needs some home-rules to be playable (one at least: VPs for money. More VPs needed to win, or more money to buy them). This is not good. But it's easy to fix.
Bought for 20 euros... it worth.

RATING: 6.5
Hmm...  Great potential on paper, but the game somehow does not live up to the expectations.

The characteristics is positive (considering it's multi-sided pure conflict game):
- reasonably quick (up to 2-2.5h with max. no. of players)
- NOT tedious
- dynamic 
- simple (but NOT simplistic!) rules - in reality
- little downtime once you know the rules well / quick players' turns
- nice feeling of figuring out how to assemble your armies/companies from 2 decks of cards very rich in types of troops

But, somehow, the game is not quite fulfilling.  I don't know - maybe the battles with zero luck element are not so exciting as you would expect them to be; maybe they are too short or it's too easy to calculate their outcome; maybe the game itself is too short (my 4 plays so far all ended in auto-win on top of that), but then the complaints would show up that the game is too long for what it offers :> ...

Another problem - you need a group of players familiar with the game to get a full satisfaction.  New players need some time to absorb all the rules and they are prone to making mistakes impacting the final outcome.  Basically you need to sacrifice 1 game to get a good grip on the title.  And I'm not sure I have a potential group of players ready to play 'Ventura' on a regular basis...

EDIT: After much consideration I've decided to sell the game.  I just won't have regular partners for playing it.  And the game is not that brilliant to just keep it on the shelf.

Sold.

Surprisingly good game. To be honest I don’t remember much about my game. I do remember that I had fun; the game had lots of conflict and it has very good bits.

The play time is somewhat long and (sadly) the board has a resource mistake printed on it. 

If I play again I will come back and re comment.

I finally played Ventura again. I have changed a lot between plays, I no longer enjoy direct conflict games so my appreciation for Ventura has taken a plunge. Still, the game has some very nice ideas.

The rules are easy to grasp and the game has great player aids. The bits are gorgeous BUT they made a mistake with the armies´ and companies ‘numbers. You cannot tell them apart quickly and this can lead to mistakes. Fortunately this is very easy to correct.
 
It has lots of luck with the cards, you can control it a bit with money, but sometimes the luck is way too much. I enjoy that you can do a lot (even win the game) without doing battle. The winner is the first player who achieves 30 Vps. 

I’m bothered by how the cards work. In my last game I couldn’t find a leader so I couldn’t build armies. I bought a lot of cards and I always got companies (bad luck). An army can easily defeat a company so it was a huge disadvantage.

The theme is boring for me.

The game plays rather quickly for a game in its category.

Bottom line, the old me should have liked the game. Nowadays I no longer enjoy direct conflict games so I no longer have a high desire to play Ventura again. The game has some nice ideas, but I think I will sell it. It has lots of luck with the cards and events.

Have played three times now and have developed a sense of the strategy behind this game.  In each game we have found that being aggressive out of the shoot leads to retreat and rebuilding.  A beautifully crafted game, with a few improvements requested (for starters, highlight the numbers on the figures).  Again, the strategy and decision making are wonderfully complex.  We added an element where we keep our units hidden until combat.  We use the "Spies" card to expose any one army or comapny and all liked this twist very much.

2012 Fantasy Flight November sale had this for $20. The price is a steal, but given the fact that this is a war game (with chess-like thinking needed), it doesn't seem like it'll make it to the table with a frequency over Small World or Memoir 44. 

PRO:
Beautiful looking game. 
A 60 minute playing time is nice.

CON: 
BGG ranking of about 2500 (therefore, it's not really on a hot list)

I still need to play this one more before I can give it a more solid rating, but I do like it. It's complex, and a lot of people dislike the buying of VP, but it seems balanced to me (if you don't invest in your army, your source of income will soon be gone). And for a heavy-ish war game it sure plays nice and fast.

Not bad.  Despite having the appearance of a Euro-style/wargame hybrid, the game itself is hugely luck dependent.  Most of the tactical decisions relate to taking a risk to be the first player or not, mostly because there is an significant disadvantage to being first.  
That said, the components are excellent, the cards are beautifully illustrated, and it is very, very quick playing.  Fairly easy to learn and the tableau is excellent.  I guess I just wish there was more game in the box.  
Tentative recommendation if you're looking for a quick war game and you can get it cheap.

There are many cool ideas in this and it felt like it should be a great game, but somehow every play left me dissatisfied. I just couldn't believe that it didn't click. The game just turns into a race of whoever draws the captain card from a facedown deck first. With the rules as specified, it is nigh broken, and from what I read on the forums, not only I tried to fix it with homerules to eventually give up. I regret it, but I refuse to spend more of my time on this game. Shame.

Per tutto il ‘300 e il ‘400 l’Italia fu dilaniata da continue guerre: gli eserciti che si fronteggiavano nei campi di battaglia erano costituiti perlopiù da compagnie mercenarie, guidate da intrepidi e ambiziosi capitani di ventura al soldo di stati e signorie in perenne conflitto.

Sei a capo di una potente famiglia in guerra: recluta le migliori compagnie e ingaggia i capitani più esperti, organizza l’esercito per condurlo in battaglia, mantieni le milizie e amministra con saggezza le ricchezze del tuo dominio. Solo chi padroneggia l’arte della guerra in tutti i suoi aspetti guadagna la supremazia assoluta.

Ventura è un raffinato gioco di strategia militare ed economica nell'Italia rinascimentale.

There's a lot of promise here and it's also possible there's a good game here, but it's pretty deeply buried in amongst some awful game design and choices.

For example, why is the artwork on the tiles so cartoony (which is fine) when the art on the cards is so serious? It's like they were each designed by different people who'd never met. Why, when you need to be able to add together all of the cards in your army do they not stack easily?! Why is it that money seems to be the overwhelmingly powerful strategy when the game is geared towards combat? Why is it so hard to find a Captain of Fortune when you need one?!

In summary: Why did this game not get more playtesting, balancing, design before being released? I've given this a 5 at the moment and it feels like a very provisional rating. This could easily be a 1 or a 7, I'm really not sure. Oddly, I'm quite (surprisingly) keen to try it again to find out...

We played this at the Gaming Hoopla. We played it twice & had a couple of rules questions. Will play it again at some point. I've played it again & downgraded it from a 7 to a 6. I think I could upgrade it again with a few house rules. I played one game where I drew almost nothing but captain's of fortune & couldn't field a decent army & another game where early on I pulled two horse carts & no captain's of fortune & was at a distinct disadvantage again. I like luck & chance in a game, but when your whole game can get thrown in the crapper like that, it needs house rules!

While the game idea is sound, the implementation is rather poor. The English rulebook is especially confusing (lacking adequate descriptions for tiles and being utterly confusing about how you add companies to the game) and the house keeping is bad and at some times unnecessary. For a 60 Euro game one has much higher expectations, hence the poor grade.

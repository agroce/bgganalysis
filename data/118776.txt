A light, quick, friendly little gateways game of pick-up and deliver.  Players are natives using their outrigger canoes to collect commodities from various neighbouring islands on a modular map and returning them to their home island for sale.  The components are delightful and artwork very well produced with many thick cardboard pieces.  

Tahiti is a very simple game of pick-up and deliver, combined with set collecting and risk management.  

The theme fits game incredibly well and nothing feels out of place.  Each turn involves up to 4 actions and with few options each turn is very quick, so it is easy to get a 4-player game done inside 60 mins.  

Overall, an enjoyable little game I would happily play again with non-gamers and a fun way to fill an hour.

Great little pickup/deliver game.  The 4 action points that decreases as the ship fills up is a clever mechanism and makes for hard choices on whether to do fewer trips or take a few short trips to nearby islands.  

Also the "only one type" vs "variety of types" provides a choice for players to pick based on the map layout.

I fell in love with Tahiti on my very first play.  Simple rules, quality production and most of all, fun.  This is my second foray into pickup-and-deliver games (behind Return of the Heroes) and based on this game, not my last.  The artwork is very nice with bright, Polynesian colors which helps support the theme.  Scales very well from 2-4 players.

RATING: 5
Super-light game of moving your canoe around from island to island and picking up different colored cubes to deliver back to home base.   Supposed to be a 30-45 minute filler, but our play with 3 players went 75 minutes since nobody wanted to collect the brown cubes.   This put the game into stall mode since islands couldn't close out and they need to do that to finish the game.   The game may be somewhat broken.   Fishing cubes from the bag is a neat idea, but you are also drawing cubes for reefs and for seeding, so it gets repetitive quickly.  In any case, the options are rather limited anyway, since variety always scores higher than large sets.   I liked the production and feel of the game, but I don't think I'd look to play it again.

A pretty good little pick-up-and-deliver set collection game about exploring islands of Tahiti picking up or fishing for goods and sailing home with them. There's not a lot of player interaction, but it's engaging enough as the board develops and players try to solve their own individual puzzles of how to beat everyone else for the stuff they want.

RATING: 6.9
Könnyed, hajókázós, gyümölcs-gyüjtögetős játék, egy kis lapkalerakással fűszerezve. 

A körében mindenki húz egy új sziget lapot, amit lehelyez tetszése szerint (némi megkötéssel) a táblára. Ezután véletlenszerűen gyümölcsökkel tölti fel a szigeteket. Ezekután jön az akciófázis, amiben hajókázhatunk kedvünkre, gyümölcsöt szüretelhetünk, illetve ha hazaértünk kipakolhatjuk a gyümölcsöket. Ezen felül lehet még halászni is. Érdekes mechanizmus, hogy minél jobban meg van pakulva gyümölccsel a kenunk, annál kevesebb akcióból gazdálkodhatunk. Jól meg kell gondolni, hogy avsok kis gyors kör, vagy a kevesebb lassú, nagy kör a kifizetődőbb-e.

A játék végén a gyümölcsök alapján kapjuk a pontokat. Számit az is, hogy egyféléből mennyi van, meg persze az is, hogy teljes szettünk van az összesféléből. 

Könnyen, gyorsan tanítható játék, kb egy óra le is zavarható. Nem kell túl sokat agyalni rajta, de azért van min gondolkodni. Nem elhanyagolható mértékű szerencse is kell a győzelemhez.
---------------
Kiegészítés a második játék után: az "ahány evezős, annyi akció" szabály kicsit nehezen átadható, főleg, hogy kör közben is folyamatosan figyelmbe kell venni.
A játéknak nagyon nehezen lesz vége, mert az utolsó szigetről összeszedni a cuccokat, általában egy kör elvesztését jelenti, mivel beérni már úgyse lehet vele. Szerintem nem kéne a kört befejezni, azonnal vége kéne, hogy legyen a játéknak. Ez se oldaná meg teljesen a problémát, de sokat javítana a helyzeten.

RATING: 4
In Tahiti, players pick up goods from various islands in the archipelago and ferry them back to their home to score points. New islands and goods come out in a semi-random fashion that severely impacts truly strategic play. The game can drag somewhat towards the end because the trips to pick up the goods and carry them back become longer and longer.

In addition to that, Tahiti suffers from the "point salad" desease. Pretty much anything you do scores a point. If you're lucky and things run your way you might score two instead, making you win. It's kind of ironic that the game feels rather pointless despite this, but even its fairly short playtime can't save the design.

And speaking of design: Did Minion Games run out of money when they commissioned the game? Why else did the artist simply drop his pen when he got to the canoe...

Average pick-up-and-deliver game with no highlights. It works but is very light and straightforward, without room for interesting strategies. Each trip, you basically decide whether you want to carry cubes of one color or one of each color, and how much you want to risk losing them. There is a little luck all around, with the constant drawing of cubes from the bag. The mechanic of the cargo limiting your actions is nice but a little clunky, as you may gain or lose actions during the turn. The functional but uninspired artwork and the dull wooden components seem to emphasize the blandness of the gameplay.

Tahiti is a pointless pickup-and-deliver game. Almost any action translates to a similar amount of points. Unless players avoid obviously nonsensical moves, it comes down to luck of the draw in replenishing resources, fishing or loosing goods on reefs on the one hand, and being lucky that the players who share one of your two secret goals don't fight hard for it on the other hand.
Another small publisher Kickstarter effort that cries out for competent development. I've now played three Minion games and I still haven't found one that convinced me.

Pick up and deliver, nice and quick, we are at the stage where we now draw tiles (including the start ones apart from the home island) and place them 'blind', so we don't control where the reefs are. Makes for a much more interesting game. And quick too once you are familiar with the rules. A keeper for us as a light game.

Action points, action points, action points. You use 'em to travel out, collect stuff, come back, store 'em. It works pleasantly enough, but there's nothing too clever to do apart from determining what others are going to do and then going off and doing something different or beating them to something. Games seem to be determined by who gets advantaged the most by the re-fills, whether the colours you want appear close by or not. I like how the map builds and then closes down, but there's otherwise not enough here to draw me back.

Based on one game:

What I like:
- Portable, attractive, small box
- Few rules; interaction is indirect/subtle
- Canoe loading and rowers are quite clever
- The game has a quiet, zen-like quality

What I don't like:
- Ended up being too simple; lacking tough decisions
- The game can drag, where players will have to consciously choose to end it
- Plays more like an abstract than I expected

I agree with the BGG-voted 1.9 weight.

A fun pick up and deliver game.  I love placing the tiles and I love the tropical islands theme.

The mechanics of this game are actually pretty brilliant, with resources being depleted, and then fishing becoming a more reliable action as crops deplete. Great use of basic 'draw from a bag'statistics as a core mechanic. Pick up and deliver them coconuts!

However, the game seems to want to use the theme of the depletion of natural resources on Rapa Nui by the natives, but also wants to use the islands of Tahiti; For some reason this game's islands feature Moai. Confusing. Would be more acceptable if this game was named after fictional set of tropical islands, rather than actual Tahiti. Confusing.

This is an excellent lightweight pick up and deliver game. It has some nice original mechanisms with the reefs and the paddle/actions. I felt a lot of tension pulling out of the bag everytime that I crossed a reef and put my cargo in danger. I also enjoy how the amount of cargo that you're holding dictates the amount of actions you'd like to take and how they change as soon as you add more of it to your canoe. The artwork is tropical, the pieces are excellent and the bag included in the game is lovely stuff. We both enjoyed it a lot and want to play it again. This is an excellent family game imo.

RATING: 6
Game has nice theme, and artwork helps brings you into the theme.  Fun to play, but IMO does not have long-term replay value due to lack of strategy.  May be a good "gateway game", although I suspect there are better ones.  Enjoyable, and will see a few more plays from me, but then will see much shelf time.

Notes:  IMO the starting tiles that do not surround the island should not be used for the game.  Further, in a two-player game, the rule allowing the person obtaining 3 points for 2nd place in collecting his family's favorite goods should not be applied.

This is a neat little tile-laying, set-collection, pick-up-and-deliver game! It would be a great introduction to the mechanic, sort of like Cinque Terre. I'm not sure you'd need to own both, but this is definitely a solid game!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Starting setup varies by player count: lay out 7 hex tiles, each of which show islands with different resource types, or water. Place the god pawn. Player boats go in the center hex. Each player gets a token indicating 2 types of goods.

Each turn, first move the god pawn towards the edge of the board. Then place a random tile (must touch 2 others and be adjacent to the god pawn). After all tiles have been played, place a desolation token instead (on empty island; makes it unavailable). If it's an island, draw 2 cubes (3 if any desolation tokens are out) from the bag; white cubes (fish) are returned to the bag; place cubes on island. Then, move your boat. Boats have 1 rower, 2 goods spaces, and 3 spaces counted as rowers unless they're storing goods. Boats may move 1 space/rower. If cross reefs during movement, draw cubes (1/reef) from bag: if any match those in your hold, discard them. May pick up cubes at islands, or fish in water: draw 2 cubes; if at least one is a fish, keep it (return rest to bag). The hold may contain one of each type of good, or all of one type. May deliver cubes to central island; place delivered cubes on your player mat.

At end of game (bag empty), score points based on the number and types of cubes you've delivered. Also score points for having delivered the most or second-most for each of the types of goods on their secret token. The player with the most points wins!

Tile-laying and pick-up and deliver. May not be ground-breaking, but accessible to casual gamers and families, good intro to pick-up and deliver genre. If you only have one title to represent the mechanic, this would be a fine choice.

Simple pick-up-and-deliver game about collecting fruit from outlying islands in a canoe. Perhaps the most interesting part is that collecting a lot of fruit displaces rowers on the boat, signifying action points; collect a lot of fruit and heading home will be slow going.

There is some luck in availability of goods, fishing, and potentially losing goods when crossing coral reefs.

All of this adds up to a tedious little "family game" with limited strategic space that potentially bogs down late in the game due to the difficulty in ferrying goods back from outer islands.

There's nothing really wrong with it.

I appreciate the trade-off how filling a canoe with more goods reduces speed of travel

I appreciate how Fish is included for scoring alongside the harvested goods yet has a distinct variation as to harvest method.

I appreciate how the element of luck is handled:

-- the act of fishing

-- the draw to determine if crossing dangerous reefs causes the loss of goods onboard

-- in spreading out how/which of the islands are replenished with goods available


Still, I feel a touch awkward each turn trying to follow through the required housekeeping before making what amounts to a very small move.

Light-medium weight.
Light player interaction.
Medium theme application.

This charming little pickup and deliver game has a lot to teach with goods quantity, type & transport risks changing up how the action points function. I do wish the format could be worked into a 5 or 6p configuration so I had more opportunities to use it as a teaching game, but as is, it'll do well with 4,& I'll be able to run it for young ones & older gamers for a cool little session.

Girlfriend and I just love this game!  IT is simple and light hearted with lots of nifty piece moving. We've taken out the goddess mechanic - I get why its there, but seemed to work fine without it.

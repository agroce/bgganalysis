I haven't played this game nearly enough.  I have started playing it online and am still trying to understand the strategy of raising dungeon petz.  This game is a challenge and is very thematic. Once you understand the rules it is simple and makes complete sense.  Great worker placement.

Heavy yet cutely themed game, everything ties in together nicely. Seems to work decently at all player counts, the moving blockers in the 2p game aren't too much hassle. Initially feels rather random with the needs cards but much of this can be mitigated with good play. Feels fairly straightforward after half a dozen plays; you know what you need to do and you have to play the players to figure out how best to do it. So the worker placement system retains some freshness. I think Lords retains its 'meatiness' better though.

Both of Vlaada's Dungeon X games bring ways for players to think/act simultaneously in a worker placement game, which I think is wonderful.

RATING: 8
A worker placement game (yes, again), where you use your imps (workers) to procure baby monsters and other materials in order to raise and "show off" and sell the monsters, both of which score you the points in the game.

This game has several good things going for it, despite the fact that it enters an extremely crowded genre: great artwork and components, scales well from 2-4 players, funny theme which works well and leads to intuitive gameplay (well mostly), and a somewhat unique selection mechanic (grouping of imps).  It's odd in that it's a reasonably complex stragey game, but also it has fairly significant random elements (card draws, customers), but these elements are very manageable and the theme is "fun" enough that it's not a big issue when things don't fall your way.  I mean I spent one game frantically shovelling poo out of my cages, and had times when I was picking up meat only to have it rot before I could use it, but that was more funny than frustrating.  It was also enjoyable to just edge out my competition (multiple times) by whipping my monster into "best in show".  

Gameplay is quite accessible, and overall this is a much better, and different, game than it's predecessor, Dungeon Lords.

RATING: 8
Thematic, entertaining, and a very serious strategy game despite the playful theme. It can be very challenging to teach this game, due to the simultaneous action selection, worker placement, and most importantly the meetings needs mechanic. I love the theme, but I do wish the game had a less playful title as it ends up dissuading more serious players, even though this game is a solid medium-heavy worker placement game with rather unique mechanics. What I love about this game: it compels you to tell stories of your pets, you remember your experience playing it, there is always a feeling of scarcity, and the game is beautifully produced with amazing details where they're meaningful (for example, each minion sticker is unique, each player board is unique, adorable pet art, the imps are perfect).

A brain burner for me and quite heavy in conception. I like the complexity and interest generated from the 'need' cards, but it strains me to figure out how to support everything and also keep in mind the ratio of cards which seems critical to good play. So it tips a bit too heavy perhaps. Still, I want to play it more. The theme is exceedingly imaginative and well done. Production is high.

Vlaada strikes again. In the almost-sequel to Dungeon Lords (only the theme has some resemblance to DL, the gameplay and some mechanics are mostly different) we get to grow and then sell pets. It's a worker-placement with some twists, with the same subperb components, gorgeous and funny manual and a game that will offer a lot of fun (and some heavy thinking sometimes) to all eurogamers.

After several games, I can say that this is a fun game and that I enjoy.  I'm not very good at it, I believe due to my risk adversity.  Vlaada games are usually punishingly difficult, which I'm okay with, but this one trips me up by requiring you to choose to take risks in order to score well.  I usually loose due to only taking on pets that I'm sure I can raise and sell, while my opponents are off potentially scoring much higher by almost failing hilariously every moment.

This one can join RftG as objectively good games that I suck at!

This is a great game! It's very fun to play and has a lot to do. Most of the things that happen feel logical and you're given a lot of opportunities to change your luck. Probably my only qualm with this game is that there isn't enough pieces. Sure, there are enough to play the game. But there isn't a whole heck of a lot of variety, especially with the cages and patrons. Still a fantastic game.

I like Dungeon Petz, mostly. It's a bit too long, a bit too random, a bit too overcomplicated -- all the "too"s we expect from Vlaada sometimes. But it's also rather fun, and while I don't see it being that much "lighter" than the awful Dungeon Lords, it spends the time and depth on your actions, not on game-driven upkeep and automatic happenings. The psuedo-auction can be annoying, but it's more interesting than the constraints of Dungeon Lords. I'll probably play this occasionally, and rather like it. The manual's a blast.

Grandioso juego de Vlaada, pero difícil como él sólo. Las reglas de los juegos de Vlaada se me resisten. A pesar de ser juegos temáticos y supuestamente intuitivos a la hora de aprenderlos, no hay manera. Eso si, una vez aprendes cómo jugar, lo único que puedes hacer es rendirte ante tan magnífico diseño. A pesar de ser un juego de apariencia "familiar" y "entrañable" es todo lo contrario: duro y para jugones de culo duro.

While I knew it was a good game after watching reviews and a let's play, it manages to exceed my expectations and reward post-game analysis.

It's fine enough, really cute theme and some interesting mechanisms. The blind bidding has some interesting decision-making and press-your-luck (in both deciding how big to make your groups and how many to commit and how many to keep for tending your animals).

It's pretty fun but I'm not sure how much here is new. It's a touch tense, like Agricola but, and I'm not sure if we maybe played wrong, it was pretty easy to avoid suffering markers. Maybe we just focused too much on tending animals (as opposed to means of scoring). The dummy player was pretty simple and it all felt like it worked with two.

I've been a detractor of Vlaada's rules before, but I thought these rules were actually pretty effective and funny (not necessary but certain nice).

Good worker placement euro-game. The game is highly thematic and the artwork is very cute. Simple mechanics but there are quite a lot of minor rules (typical in Vlaada's games). The pets have a personality of their own and their behaviour can be unpredictable sometimes.  The game is a bit fiddly as you have to deal cards and refill the board spaces every round. Still casual gamers love it.

I had heard that Dungeon Petz incorporated some fun and novel worker placement mechanics and was thematically VERY strong...and found this to be quite true.

Interesting game, not exactly an accessible game to the general public, or easily taught even to gamers, since the rules set is practically advanced war game length.

The emphasis in Dungeon Petz is so clearly on more and more details, and NOT on making the game elegant in its simplicity or ease to play, it is laughable. This game wants to include everything possibly pertinent to the theme.

The theme is...dare I say it...cute...and ironically, considering the fact that pet ownership in western culture is a huge part of millions of people's lives...should be VERY resonant with millions of "potential gamers." In other words, pet "ownership and upkeep" games in theory could have a potentially HUGE audience.

Dungeon Petz, however, is not the game that is going to reach that potentially huge audience, at least not until they enter into "pet ownership and upkeep gaming" through a different gateway game...yet to be designed, then want something much more "advanced" and reach for Dungeon Petz.

Dungeon Petz definitely meets the definition of a board game as being "art" and "a distinctive world that you enter." Well done.

Fantastic artwork and theme. All of the actions fit together very nicely and help sell the entire theme of the game. Well written rules are very entertaining but can be difficult to remember. Setup time at the start of the game and between turns is very time consuming and becomes tiring as it drags down the already slow pace of the game. There are a number of obscure things in this game that can be difficult to remember that really irritate my wife that keeps her from really enjoying this one. Between the hard to remember rules, fiddly setup, and the length vs. enjoyment factor of this game, we can't really see ourselves playing this again; there are too many other better games that fit into this time frame that are less annoying. Sold to make room in the collection.

El juego es divertido y te obliga a pensarte bastante las jugadas. Durante cada turno hay muchas cosas por hacer y los bloqueos entre jugadores son una constante siempre presente. El hecho de que los turnos tengan un comprador y una competición determinados al azar hace que cada partida se juegue diferente y eso le da bastante rejugabilidad. Pueden darse momentos de AP, sobre todo cuando debes administrar varias criaturas en un mismo turno. También hay que tener en cuenta que hay un cierto factor de azar ya que las cartas de necesidades no siempre muestran los resultados esperados y eso puede frustrar tus planes en más de una ocasión.

RATING: 9
Update:  Upon further review, this is actually not lighter than Dungeon Lords.  The auction mechanism can make it go/no go on spots for single spots, whereas with Dungeon Lords, at least there are 3 spots for each action.  It also requires a bit more strategy than Dungeon Lords because of planning for multiple exhibitions and selling to buyers. 

Lighter and slightly more random than it's older brother Dungeon Lords, but still has the same tough worker placement choices.  Have only played it twice, but it seems like a keeper to me.

The 'sequel' to Dungeon Lords is just as vivid and animated, with distinct artwork and an even more unique theme. Raise, exhibit and sell a variety of zany monster pets, but you'll need to meet their needs. Smooth worker placement mechanics, colorful components, all part of a surprisingly deep game with a lot of decisions to be made. A bit more involved than your typical Medium Euro, but well worth learning, and the rulebook is so hilarious that I must have caught myself laughing out loud a half dozen times, and it just makes the learning all the more engaging.

I love how the game's mechanics make the pets both assets and liabilities (just like a baby pet Cthulu should be!)  You want your pet to be angry enough to impress a customer, but not so angry that it breaks its cage.  Hungry enough to win the eating contest, but only when you have enough food to feed it.  Having the pets' needs be somewhat probabilistic (though not completely) via the need cards was a great design choice, and it really brings the pets to life.  This system also adds a push-your-luck component to the game: should I splurge on the marketplace this round, or should I keep my imp at home, just in case Snakitty is feeling extra playful today?

Also, this game has lots of poop, and poop is funny!

Cons for this game include the complexity of its rules.  It might be the hardest game to learn in my collection... although the rules are easy to remember due to their thematic consistency. It's also fairly fiddly.  At the beginning of every round, restocking the marketplace (cages, addons, food, artifacts, pets) is a bit annoying, especially if you're also taking the dummy imps into account when playing with less than 4 players.

A great theme, and very nice artwork, but the game itself is a bit confusing. It's not that it's too hard, or even too deep... it's that I frankly don't know what to go for. It's a bit too chaotic for me.

Still, a game I enjoy, and one I'd probably want to play most of the time.

Despite of the theme, this game is not so easy to play. It requires a lot of thinking to solve the puzzle in satysfying pets. 
Edit: After some plays, my rating falls. It's not easy to indroduce new players to DP. Moreover there's not so much interaction between players.

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed my first play of this.  While complicated, it was still much easier to grasp and develop a strategy than it's big brother (Dungeon Lords).  

I also really enjoy the tamagochi-like theme of raising monsters to sell and show.

Dungeon Petz is a worker placement game that really rewards careful planning over the opportunistic tactical stuff.  The game creates some really challenging situations in trying to juggle limited actions against the varied and multiple needs of your creatures.

RATING: 9
Clearly a game where the theme came before the mechanics. The good aspect of it is that the theme is strong, the bad aspect is the game is full of tiny rules and small exceptions that make it harder for new players to get into the game.
The somewhat unpredictable behaviour of the pets is quite funny to watch (and difficult to master), and the whole aspect of buying cages and then assigning the best way possible the pets to each cage, and being able to feed your pets, and saving the more adequate cards to use when you have to do an exibition or you have to sell your pets.
Overall a very well thoughtout game, unfortunately only works with 2, 3 or 4 players.

Azonos pontot adok rá, mint a Lordsra, nehezen tudnám őket rangsorolni. Van amiben egyik jobb, van amiben a másik. Sok a megegyező elem, hasonló a téma, hasonló a stílus. De a Petz vidámabb, barátságosabb hangulatú. A Lordsnál bonyolultabb egy kör menete, a Petznél ez kicsit egysíkúbb: állatokat veszünk, nevelünk, majd eladunk... 

A legnagyobb különbség az akcióválasztásban van: a Lords mechanizmusa is nagyon érdekes, a Petznek is ez az erőssége szerintem: amiben eltér a hagyományos worker placementtől, hogy itt több munkás is mehet egy helyre, titkosan állítjuk be, hogy hány munkásból álló csapatokat küldenénk ki, és ezek létszáma határozza meg a sorrendet. Utána a szokásos akcióválasztás történik.

Ezen kívül is további nagyon sok érdekes ötlet van: az állatok fejlődése profin van megoldva a korongokon, jók a távoli rokonok, a szar a ketrecben, a gombolyag, amivel játszanak az állatok:)... láthatóan a szerző bármilyen témából képes összegyúrni egy jól működő soktényezős minden-mindennel összefügg játékot.
És szokás szerint vicces is a játék (soha egy játék alatt sem hangzott el ennyiszer a "szar" szó.:))

Ami nem annyira tetszett, az a kártyák miatti szerencsefaktor. A végső eladásoknál brutális különbségek adódhattak ebből. Ehhez képest nekem túl hosszú a játék (1 óra szabály, 3 óra játék). Órákig szerezgetjük a pontokat a körvégi versenyekből, eladásokból, és a végén pár jó kártyával akár megduplázhatjuk addigi pontjainkat.

Szerintem nem könnyű játék, de jó szórakozás.

Szép, vicces, összességében örülök, hogy kipróbáltam, de nagy kedvenc nem lesz azért, bár szerethetőbb, mint a Lords...

Ok. This is a good game. It reminds me of Drum roll, another economic game in which the financial aspect is hidden behind the richness of the theme. Actually these 2 games have more in common than meets the eye. The different abstract-coloured cubes/needs of the performers/animals is another similarity.

The best part in Petz is explaining the rules! after that, the first play is a bit introductory. On your second play you begin to realize the economic engine a bit better. It is a good game but not one that will have you jumping up and down from excitement. The choices are balanced and the theme is very rich. It is a perfectly fine semi-economic euro with many small innovations. The rules actually sound a lot harder than the gameplay really is. Its complexity is the same as Dungeon Lords, and its difficulty is lighter.

Vlaada strikes again: 2011 is a great vintage for the czech designer if this is his second most important game of that year (number one is of course Mage Knight)!
Dungeon Petz is a worker placement game merged with some blind bidding: every player secretly groups his imps, and lager groups will be placed earlier. This leads to a fierce competition for most useful placements, and to very tense games.
The game is thematically great, with a fantastic rulebook, awesome artwork and a great graphic design (I love the functional petz, with their "egg" backside), and its probably better that its predecessor Dungeon Lords (they share some fiddlyness, but Dungeon Petz is probably less fiddly).
Last but not least: it's a great 2-player game (the dummy player is fast to implement and the movement of its imps can be taken into account when planning)!
Can't wait to try it again, even with the advanced variant...

Initial Impression: Here's a game with great components and mechanisms that are strongly tied to the wonderful theme. The game has a bidding mechanism, followed by a worker placement phases. Overall though, the game hinges on chaos management as you have to see to the needs of your creatures. One of my favorite aspects of the game is that this is not a VP salad in the end. Reading the rulebook, it seems that the game is also very 2player friendly.

As an unorganized person, this game was just not for me.  Far too many little bits to manage and too many unintuitive exceptions to rules.  On a positive side the themme is original and cool, and is supported by the mechanics.  It's too bad the mechanics are so clunky.

RATING: 8.5
Base game only for now and I've only played this one at 2 players. It's a game that requires serious planning while still being charming (due to its theme). It does play heavier than I expected. I often feel like there must be some streamlining that could improve the game, but when I think about every rule, there's nothing I would change. When I finish, I want to play again immediately. It's really good. 

There's a good amount of nuance in the card play and the depth of that aspect was very surprising There are ways to mitigate the luck of the draw a bit by good hand management.

The rating gets a bump, since my wife has requested to play this one.

FAVORITE HEAVY WEIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT GAME

2-4 Players (Best: 4) / 90 Min / Weight: 3.53
Type: Strategy

Expansions Owned:

Dungeon Petz: Dark Alleys

This game is one of the most complex games I have, but still can be played by my 8-year-old daughter. (Actually she kept asking me to buy this after watching it from Youtube.) It is possible because this game is really well designed, rules are written very clearly, and everything is well fit to the theme. It is not surprising that Rahdo chose this game as the best thematic euro game.

I've only played this two times so far, but I was already able to know how good this game is (actually I was able to know that even before playing it by reading the rules.) The reason I gave 9 is because I haven't played with more people yet. The rate might be changed later once I play it more.

I'm usually not a fan of blind bidding games.  However, if you bid poorly in DP, you are allowed to take back your imps.  Having them shovel poop or collect gold makes blind bidding more tolerable.

Our first Vlaada Chvatil game.

I was very excited when I finally received my ordered package. But my excitement faded away with more and more plays.

The game has (typically Vlaada) lots of different game mechanisms mashed together. It works quite well but is not very intuitive at times (the "creature needs"-cards with their colour-coding caused confusion for 2 other players) and at other times I had to ask myself "Why? Is this mechanism really needed?".

In the end, Dungeon Petz has just a bit too much stuff to remember and think about during each round (beware of AP-prone players).
A little streamlining would have been a very good thing.

Takes a while to teach and takes a bit to absorb what is going on in the game but once that initial slog is out the way this is a fun, thematic, heavyish game with interesting mechanisms.  Could probably do with both a bit of streamlining and an intro version.  Working out how to manage your need cards and start using strategy to make the most of the scoring options takes one or two plays but is really where this game sings mechanically speaking.  As yet only played 1 4 player game and one two player game.  Lots to love although it does run quite long.  In addition to running long its easy to be shut out either from a one off mistake, unexpected groupings of imps by opponents or bad luck and it can be impossible to recover.

Hmmm...this is a tough one. I enjoyed this game. But I probably wouldn't pull it out again unless it was specifically requested. I will say that it is a well designed game, dripping with theme. And nobody seems to tie theme to gameplay like Vlaada. I recommend giving it a try, but only if you like euros and very little direct player interaction. The only thing you can do to a runaway leader is block the spot he wants in the worker placement phase. I like it enough that it will stay in my collection, but not enough to buy any expansions.

It's Vlaada Chvatil!  Seriously though, an extremely elegant worker placement game with an awesome theme and some additional auction/selling mechanics that combine to make one heck of a good time.  

Probably 2-3 games to completely get your head around, but once you do, it all makes sense.. extremely cohesive, always tight scoring, and a beautiful theme.

Also, the mechanic used for 2 & 3 players is perfect, and the artwork is some of the best in any game, ever.

I have to give this game props for being an original theme. The components are nice as well. It is a pretty well regarded worker placement game. However, the theme just didn't work for me. Also, I struggled with grasping the strategies as it just wasn't that intuitive in my opinion. The graphic design and symbols just didn't click with me as I often struggled to see what spots were left for my workers (imps). I constantly had to keep checking the rules, etc. I think it would take several plays before I'd feel comfortable with the rules and strategies, but I real don't feel like even trying it again.

One of the most thematic games I have ever played. It rubs that Tamagochi vibe from my childhood. Great theme and mechanic with wonderful artwork. It is however a quite heavy game, don't get fooled by it's appearance. Beause of that it does not hit the table as much as I would like it to. But if you are looking for a REALLY GOOD worker placement with an actual theme that is not forcefully pasted on? That's your game.

RATING: 5.5
First Play: The rules take a while to absorb and a while to explain but the rule book is logical and if you have played Dungeon Lords, it has a similar flow.

After one play the jury is out. Yes the build quality is excellent and there is so much to think about. Mistakes are dealt with brutally and when your petz start to suffer they are almost impossible to sell. The incident pit deepens and you know early on that you wont win. I don't think that is a bad thing, quite the opposite, however my reservations centre on the 'Need' Cards. 

Under tha basic rules the cards have one value and although there is a frequency based upon colour the deal is utterly random. A bad deal can cut you off at the ankles or set you up with a sale worth over 20 points. This disparity is eased slightly by the advanced variant that offers a second choice to some cards, but the random nature of the draw still remains.

Some players may like this randomness, I need a second play but I fear that this issue may result in me selling the game on swiftly if there isn't a course of action to mitigate this chaos.

Second Play: Yes I managed to build a suitable foundation to support varying needs but I could do nothing to influence the cards for exhibitions and sales. This is what I now believe to tip the game towards being more heavily influenced by luck than applied strategy. A fun game, but not one I wish to keep in my collection as I would rather play Dungeon Lords any time over this.

Sold 14th Nov 2011

Persuaded to play to demo for a friend. By now this is quite a joyless experience. The fun of jostling for positions on the board is so fatally spoiled by the anticipation of what need cards will be drawn. Good and bad draws are treated with a fatalistic shrug, success and failure are mainly results out of your control.

Initial impressions:

Absolutely terrible, waste-of-time game.  Well, the base game is.

The game is almost reasonable enough, with the massive exception of receiving all  your card "income" at the end of the turn when you can change nothing with the random cards you receive.  Oh look, all my reds are play cards instead of at least one happy card...guess I lose.  Complete waste of time, why not play two-card Candyland (you receive two cards and "choose" between them - hey look, meaningful "decisions!").

So...the idea is to modify it, to change the timing of your income to the beginning of the turns, or when you grab a new income source.  Also, using the "advanced/better" rules of having all the buyers/competitions face-up at the beginning, as well as using the advanced cards.

With those improvements, this is probably a 4 or a 5 - a reasonably light game still overburdened with too much superficial complexity for what the game is worth.  The only real interesting decisions here are what your imp groups will look like, and when to sell your animals over the course of the game.  The rest is just optimization.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Although I give it kudos for the innovative design and theme, the randomness of the cards drawn and taking actions based on blind bidding didn't sit well with me. The game feels puzzly, fiddly, tactical and slightly overwrought for what it is. 

It didn't help that I was loosely taught the rules verbally and have not read them myself. Perhaps, that is an influencing factor in my opinion or maybe it's just one of those games that needs to be road tested a few times before you get accustomed with the ride.

Still, it held my attention for it's uniqueness and tense decisions. I need to play more to solidify my assessment.

RATING: 9
This game absolutely oozes theme and personality while maintaining a highly competitive game space with deeply rich decisions. Player interaction comes through during blind bidding of shopping groups for worker placement, where you have to weigh out essentially having more actions vs having earlier actions and taking things before your opponents. It's tight and tense and wonderful! There are a lot of things to do, but a very limited number of spaces. And then we have the actual caring for the petz themselves, which allows a high level of strategy while necessitating tactical flexibility because it really does feel like you are trying to meet the needs of a living thing with somewhat unpredictable wants. So you have to decide how much you want to press your luck at every turn, both through blind bidding for actions and preparing for the unexpected with pet care. It's incredibly competitive and complex without ever being dense due to the amazingly intuitive nature of the rules. Everything just makes sense. And it's hilarious! The rules made me laugh out loud. I cannot stress enough how much personality is packed into this one, enhanced by the gorgeous artwork. If I were to say one minor drawback, it's that luck can occasionally be too great a factor. This is generally rare, however, and the more skilled play wins out more often than not. I do think it plays best with the full player count and loses a tiny bit of it's greatness when scaled down to lower player counts.

The thematic integration is excellent for a worker placement Euro.  The well-integrated theme also makes understanding the game much easier than other Euros of a similar weight (IMHO).  The rule book is entertaining, the gameplay tight and smooth, and the length just about right (once learned).  

And, most importantly, my wife loves it so regardless of game group availability, it actually gets to the table.

HOWEVER, it is also fiddly and has a lot of randomness (primarily the card draw) that is difficult to mitigate and surprising in what is primarily a strategic game.

Very thematic throughout: from the rulebook to the game play.  The only rulebook that was actually fun to read through.  The theme is very fun and added to our enjoyment.

Graphic design and art was exemplary throughout as well.

We found it to be very heavy, with all of the exhibits and buyers to plan for, both in the current round and the next (two)!  That's not a negative though, just have to be ready for the heaviness.  (Most of the time we like heavy.)

The unique feature of this game for us was thematically-linked -- the managing and playing of cards based on the needs of your pets and the requirements of buyers and judges.

It's a fun and challenging game with lots of theme. I really enjoy the puzzle of assigning needs cards to your pets and having to work to meet those needs or deal with the consequences. I don't love the blind bidding element that requires you to place workers and gold into groups.

Great, dark humor just like Dungeon Lords.  It definitely felt less strategic to me than D.L.  It was a fun experience but I guess I enjoy games more that give me a sense of opportunity, rather than D.L. and this one which just overwhelm me with a sense of impending doom.

Cute worker placement with an excelent and hilarious theme!

Acquire a pet, raise it the best you can, by accomodating him with the best cages available and feeding it. Not a easy job as they grow up.

Then... sell it! Get points for matching the buyers desires.

It's tense, the way the worker placement works. The auction is very interesting and the artwork is gorgeous!!!

And what about the rulebook? It's written in a way it seems a fairy tale book, with a comical environment.

Reaaly enjoyed this one!

This game is hillarious! It is pretty, it has great theme (funny imps). It is not easy, actually it is difficult. There are many rules You have to remember and use them without any hesitation. Overall this game is worth every penny. And it is created by Vlaada ;) for players without paralysis of decision-making!

Worker (imp) placement + hand management game with unrepeatable theme! :)

Set up before the game and during the game after each round can be annoying for some players.

Super fun, great puzzly mechanics, and one of the only bidding (sort of ) games that I enjoy. I instantly wanted the expansion. My only real complaint is that it feels like sometimes you can get really lucky with certain customers, particularly the ones that score high with rare cards (poop cards). 

Update: I now enjoy more bidding games

This game is simply brilliant. It is essentially worker placement, but it does not feel like worker placement. The designer has done such a good job with theme and mechanics ( all so integrated) There is depth here as well and I think I will be playing this one enough to not have to worry about keeping it dusted.

Bought used off Craigslist. Excellent condition.
There is a lot to like here.  Baby monsters.  Dungeons.  Imps.  Gameplay is tight, players are forever scrambling to make decisions based on dwindling options. Needs cards introduce a bit of luck into the mix which can put off more strategic players.  Plays great at all player counts.

Interesting take on worker placement, where you can use a combination of your workers and money as a bid mechanic to place before others.  I handily beat my opponents, but I'm not sure if that was due to good play or because the cards i got fit nicely.  I'm mostly wondering how much of an issue randomness will be with this.  Want to play again.

Said during our first game: [i]"Sorry guys, I can't participate in Children's Day.  I'm up to my neck in poop!"[/i]

Some familiar worker placement mechanics mixed with some new ideas.  Lots of fun to choose your pet's individual needs that both hurt you and are the source of all of your points. 

Like a lot of Vlaada's games, you'll spend lots of time learning/teaching, but only an hour or two playing. And also like a lot of Vlaada's games, it's an amazing mix of Euro mechanics tightly tied to the theme.

Speaking of the theme, it's really delightful.  I hope in teaching I got across how [i]funny[/i] the entire concept is.  Unfortunately, the most funny bits are in the rulebook, so it's really on the instructor to get that across (IE, the difference between how the instructions describe it, and just saying "then we move off one pet, and add a meat token to the pool...")

After the Troope around the Paladin has successful raided the Lord´s Dungeon and killed all the evil monsters, the Lord of the Dungeon has fleed in the mountains to build up a new residence. We now have to rear the monsters, that they can work in this new dungeon. DunPetz plays in 5 rounds a bit faster and different than its big brother DL. And the game fits the theme very good and cute. The box is brought by Santa Clause within two Gamebox-Petz!

A worker placement "put on a show" game. After one play, I'd say it's lighter than Pret-a-Porter but with a much cooler theme.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's too hard to be a gateway game.  I'll play it a few more times, but I don't think it's different enough to stay in my collection.

8-June update: I don't like anymore than I did before.  However, it seems like a fairly easily approachable worker placement game that I think people like.  I will probably keep this in my collection as a gateway+ WP game.  Plus it's one my gf likes

Another solid Vlaada offering. Much better than Dungeon Lords- I really liked how the theme tied nicely together with the many disparate parts. Getting the unique pets and then having to find cages for them and manage their needs, while building them up to sell them- all just clicked nicely together for me (although I came last in my first 4-player game). Looking forward to the next 2 plays of this as it is the game of focus at EBGL- can definitely see this going to an 8.

Played 2 player.  Can't imagine playing with more.

This is a game where the mechanics and book keeping get in the way of game flow.  It's just all so tedious and fiddly, with poo cubes, and damage cubes, and flipping over a zillion cards to meet needs.  

Some games like le havre or puerto rico just feel well paced... this is the opposite.  It just bogs down and starts to feel like a boring day job rather than an entertaining exercise.

Initial rating a 4.  No desire to play this again.

RATING: 6
Right now, this one is a little underwhelming.  I like the theme and the art, but in all honesty, I find it a little limp.  I'm not sure why.  The lack of tension comes from how subtle the game actually is.  Are you going to frequently be unable to meet your animals' needs?  Likely not.  When you do have to let one of your pets down, it will likely involve a small, incremental amount of badness.  Likely the animals will suffer a little by the end of the game, but you'd have to mess up pretty bad to have them really hurting.  Thus, the monthly competitions feel a little underwhelming: "My critter has one less poop than yours, so I score 4 and you score 3.  Ha!"  The game just doesn't feel as hectic and crazy as you expect it to.  Is there a good Euro in here, though?  Well, it doesn't help that the first 3 times we played, we got something wrong (a "worst-ever" for us in this regard).  So - I am unsure.  But my got-it-right 3 player game was not significantly more exciting.  So, right now I'd say it's decent - maybe I'll like it more with more plays, or maybe it will hit the trade pile.  We'll see.

Cute, thematic, and fun game with awesome art and bits. I love the hand management mechanics: lots of interesting decisions to make from turn to turn. Very reminiscent of Mage Knight in some ways. The dummy player for the two-player version works well, and the game is just long enough to feel "meaty" but not so long as to grow tiresome.

Dungeon Lords was interesting but more than a bit on the long and footery side and I was looking forward to this as the early feedback seemed to suggest it had improved on those things.  First, there are similarities and similar-ish theming but this is a different game from 'Lords', rather than just an adaptation.  One of the similarities is that there are a lot of interconnecting mechanisms, tiles and cards to keep track of, which makes it slightly intimidating to pick up and play at a convention as we did - but easier than 'Lords' at least.  The good news is that all those interconnecting mechanisms give you a fair amount to think about and plenty of decisions to make.  The bad is that it still feels a bit on the long and footery side, though not to the same extent as 'Lords' and probably speeds up on repeat play - which I suspect would improve my rating too.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ A very thematic strategy eurogame, half  simultaneous action selection (at least, a kind of basic worker placement plan for the round), half worker placement, where mechanisms and theme integrate really well.
++ The theme is really appealing and original and the art is cute and funny.
++ I really like the partly predictable pets needs, because you'll have to be creative to workaround this randomness to then pursue your strategy.
++ I like that it's a game with no direct confrontation that play well at 2-players (I don't mind the dummy imps).
++ There is an expansion available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it). 


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- There are many rules that, even though not complicated, must be assimilated correctly.
-- There is a lot of steps in each phase of each round and a lot of upkeep (this is not a streamlined elegant Euro like the one I love), so the game flow is always halted.
-- This game is way longer than I like (although to be fair, time pass fairly quickly while playing, as there is not a lot of downtime because some parts of the game can be played simultaneously) but I will probably never play this games with more than 2 players.
-- There doesn't seem to have anything new or innovative in this game.
-- The game has so many components and boards that it take a lot of table space.
-- The rule book, although funny to read, is not really practical and is hard to find the needed information.
-- This is a heavy game (despite the fun/cute theme) and it's at the limit of being too heavy / brainburner for my wife.
-- Harder and longer to teach to new people, because of all the rules, and also because you have to closely monitor new players to be sure they do everything correctly during the parts that are played simultaneously.

Worker Placement im Dungeon Lords Universum. Tolle Ideen mit  viel Humor umgesetzt.

Signiert vom Meister! ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another cool twist on the worker placement genre, where players are tending to the needs of wacky pets, attempting to raise them for profit.  You'll find yourself tending to your pets' needs, while trying to cater to the fairly specific whims of buyers that come along to purchase your pets.  Each turn a buyer comes along that wants certain pet features; some buyers want a playful pet, some want an aggressive pet, and some even don't mind a pet that has been mistreated and is sitting around in its own feces.  Yeah, buyers are weird like that.

One interesting mechanism is the way worker placement is handled.  Players secretly create groups of imps (workers) behind their screens each turn.  When the groups are revealed, whoever placed the biggest group goes first, and play continues according to who currently has the largest group remaining until all groups are placed.  So, playing a couple large groups means you'll go first, but not get many actions, while playing several smaller groups means you'll get a lot of actions, but the choice actions might be taken by the time you get to place anything.  A pretty neat system.

Overall, this is a pretty cool little worker placement/resource management game where the theme really helps out the fun factor!

Terrific art and sense of humor. Thematically solid. I love the way blind bidding is incorporated into the worker placement. Lovely components. It can take a while to explain everything but the rules are intuitive and the mechanics make perfect thematic sense (sending your imps out to bribe judges, bring home cages, buy pets, recover workers from the hospital or immigration office, etc.), so after a round or two everyone will know what they are doing and the game moves very quickly. Meeting the random needs of your pets while still having all the specific things to score in exhibitions and sell pets makes for a challenging yet fun puzzle element.

Very good Euro game with one of the best themes around. Players must buy all sorts of monstrous pets, place them in cages and meet all of their wild needs.

I love the variability of the game with the different pets, buyers, and exhibition tiles to keep things interesting from game to game. My first Vlaada game and still my favorite of his to this day.

I was a bit underwhelmed by this game, but that’s only because I had really high expectations.

Nevertheless, I still liked the game quite a lot. How to get new pets and food and cages for them, the aging mechanic which make them harder to control - and especially how to take care of your pets by playing cards and keeping them satisfied. The platform seems to be quite important for extra points.

One thing I have noticed after a handful of plays is that there is a tendency towards a somewhat repetitive gameplay; even though new customers and pets pop up in each game, the overall gameplay feels a little "same-y".

RATING: 5.5
Based on one play.  Lots of interesting things but felt quite samey after a while compared to other workers placement.

There are optimal spots but it seems there are too many good spots so people generally won't be punished too much for picking a different spot.  I feel like this reduces player interaction to an almost non-existent level.

Puts me in mind of a Tamagotchi-simulator (part of its initial appeal), but is so much more than that. Rather a lot of components - which can be tricky to initially get to grips with - but there is a fantastic game at its core. The dummy player mechanics are far superior to those of its predecessor (Dungeon Lords).

Also purchased: the Meeple Resource stylised token set - which really makes the game!

Vlaada Chvatil once again nails a great mixture of theme with mechanics to create a game where you feel like your raising animals, showing, and selling them effectively.  The game can be very tricky, but loads of fun.  I may enjoy it more then DL.

RATING: 8
Great game with sky high production values and an awesome theme. I really enjoy the blind bidding order for taking actions. If you really need a spot you better be willing to pay up because you can be sure someone else wants it too. Managing your pets with the need cards is an interesting puzzle, especially when you are trying to save the right cards for potential buyers.

This is another Vlaada game that is pretty tough to teach, but it is so worth it once you get the rules down.

Certainly a step up in complexity from the games we have previously owned. Out first play took 5 hours as we spent a lot of time checking the rules. In our first two plays we made mistakes with the rules, but are feeling more on top of it now. I think it will take about four plays before we are moving smoothly. L is 9 (nearly 10) and it says 10 plus on the box. L is as on top of the rules as us, but I think it will take her a while before she wins.

Likes: It's a pretty cool spin on the worker placement/bidding genre. You place workers based on a blind bid. Sure analysis paralysis may kick in, but it becomes reverse psychology type than the agonizing type. Plus, the theme and artwork is just awesome.

Dislikes: A player can get pretty behind if they play their first turn wrong.

Currently this is my favorite worker placement game, but I still feel it has some minor problems but I cannot really say what are those. Until I try out more games of this genre I leave this 9 out here.

RATING: 7
2 plays in:
The "full rules" are unsurprisingly much better. To Vlaada's credit, and also unsurprisingly, this feels like no other game. Well, the worker placement part does, but there's this thing where you get a bunch of cards representing "needs" of your pets (eating, poopoing, magic, anger, play) and you have to satisfy them through various means. Thematically your pets are autonomous, and you have to just deal with what they do. But gameplay-wise you get a big pool of needs and you assign them to different pets, which makes no sense. But makes for an interesting puzzle. And puzzle it is. Ultimately, I'm finding that these "puzzle" games (see Mage Knight) are fun, but not exactly my thing so much. Every turn feels like a puzzle to solve. But the good news is that everyone is solving it at the same time! That makes the game pretty accessible. But the puzzles tend to get more complicated as you get more pets, and not everyone has the same number of pets, so it can happen that some players' puzzles are significantly more complicated than others, which means some players can be waiting. Not a huge deal though. It has an element of blind bidding, which will not be everyone's cup of tea. I find that part to be a bit nerve-wracking, as I can never figure out what the right amount is. Rather than bid for one thing at a time, you're bidding for turn order of multiple actions at once.

Aún no he podido terminar una partida completa, pero me aventuraré a ponerle una nota.
Euro de colocación de trabajadores (diablillos) donde cada jugador tiene su propia tienda de mascotas (monstruitos). La gestión de las necesidades de cada mascota con las cartas es la clave del juego... y no es nada fácil; se trata de minimizar daños más que otra cosa. Conseguirás puntos en las exhibiciones y por la venta de tus mascotas.
Muy divertido y entretenido! Me ha gustado mucho! De momento, se lleva un notable alto a la espera de jugar más.

Very fun/whimsical game.  It is drenched in theme that appeases me.  I love the notion of raising monster petz and making sure they are happy...And they poo!  [microbadge=22882]  The way the imps are utilized as a auctioning turn order and worker placement works great.  Really makes you plan your turns in advance.  

There is a lot of planning that needs to be done in this game.  We have the goals of the customers shopping for petz, the display requirements, and the cards gathered/distributed during the rounds going towards the petz that need to be considered.  It [i]could[/i] lead to AP, but it's still a very fun game. 

I'd like to see this game come to the table more often, but recently I've been playing solitary two-player games.  This game feels rather long when I do it this way.

I like the auction-y twist on worker placement, and like the logistical puzzle of trying to meet a bunch of semi-predictable needs under various constraints. I'm less certain what I think of the game-as-a-whole-thing.

We played the last two rounds under a hard deadline (30 minutes before we had to be done); I liked the game more at that pace than the pace of the first 3 rounds, despite having less time for thought.

RATING: 8.5
A charming and thematically rich game of risk management and board reading, with a few interesting tweaks to classic worker placement design. Given the theme and artwork, new players are often unprepared for how complex it can be and the game can be pretty punishing for the first few plays; its saving grace is that it (mostly) manages to be fun even if you're losing quite badly. It's best to make new players' expectations clear ahead of time. I can't help but feel like certain elements could have been streamlined (the exhibition and sale phases always seem a little sluggish and overwrought) but the overall experience is still incredibly satisfying, frequently hilarious, and challenging in consistently interesting ways.

Argh I am tempted by half scores with this game. 6... 7... 6.5?

The game is fun. It just has longer setup/teardown times, and is one of those games that requires me to review a lot of rules before playing it again as they just aren't natural, even though they are all very thematic and purposeful and reasonable.

Outside of that, of course, it's fun to raise little critters and let them loose on the world!

At it's core, it's a really good game...

Turn over,
- remove minions
- age the petz
- add new petz
- add cage
- add improvement
- move neutral minions
- turn customer
- turn contest
- ...

too many steps in the refresh phase.

We also took out the expansion. We kept having to refer to the rulebook all the time with it. Simply because every single individual addition has a special rule to it. Every new artifact, new petz, new tiles. Not everyone of those come every game...

Not nearly as complex or "indirect" as Dungeon Lords.  Your goals are clear and concise.  You raise monsters to show in exhibitions and to sell. 

This game is also much more "reactionary" as in you move into each round with a goal in mind and then you need to adjust to the randomness of the round.  But you have quite a lot of flexibility in what you can do to adjust to the randomness, so the player has quite alot of control of the events.  IMO, this makes the game much more "euro game like" than Dungeon Lords.

Great game.  Lots of fun.

A neat action and resource management game wrapped in a theme of caring for monster pets in an effort to sell them most effectively for money/points. The random reveal in the game and card counting of the different colors of the types of need cards isn't that interesting to me for some reason, but the main part of the game is in the simultaneous hidden bidding for actions by gold/goblins which is the best part of the game. Turn order tie breaker seems to be too important in this game at times though. Required dummy player with fewer than four makes this game really a 4 player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Such an amazing worker placement game! Just beware, that this game is super long, and really requires the right group to play with.

The theme really shines through and it's definitely cute and unique. I like the worker placement aspect and the secret bidding.

When taking care of your pets needs you draw a bunch of cards and then try to put them in piles for each pet and it really slows the game down and just feels awkward and fiddly. Also the way the buyers change each round is kind of strange as well. I wish the game was more focused on a long term goal with your pets and not so short term. 

I feel like a variant would make me like this game more.

Picked this up in summer of 2012.  This is one of our more complex games, but it doesn't feel like it because the rules and gameplay make so much sense within the theme of the game.  We made quite a few mistakes on our first couple of plays, but each time it was still a lot of fun.  I prefer to play this with the full 4 players so we don't have to keep track of the 'dummy imps'.

This is a very funny game. 
From the art to the game instructions.
Don't let the cute little artwork fool you into thinking this is a kid's game, because it's not.
This was my 2nd worker placement game and it was a huge leap into the mechanic.
It's dificult to grasp the whole game at first but the symbology on the player aids helps for future plays.
It's a bit prone to analysis paralysis due to figuring out what is the best combination to score on the Exhibitions, sell pets to the customers and satisfy the needs of your pet.
While I did enjoy the game quite a bit, I doubt it will hit the table frequently with my group as it's a bit too complex.
If you like the theme and like a bit more puzzling worker placement give this game a try.

A lot is going on in this game, but the gist of it is that you plan your strategy and then hope to draw the cards that permit you to implement it --- the reverse of the more customary mechanism. All players have a chart that shows the card distributions, so you have an idea which cards are likely to appear. This mechanism probably would inject just the right amount of uncertainty into a simple and short game but does not work so well in this complex and fiddly game.

absolute reccomendation with the caveat that this game is by no means light and forgiving like the theme may suggest. The action spaces are tight and making the little groups of imps is tricky and managing one round alone with 3 monsters with what seems like a whole deck of card in your hand and still score points is not easy at all. But with repeated plays the game becomes easier to figure out and the charm really comes through.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Somewhat fiddly worker-placement/action-selection game with a daft, non-engaging theme. All you're doing is pushing cubes from one box to another for differing returns, there's no narrative. The main board is just holding boxes, although your own 'tableau' does have some positional aspects to it. The worker/selection mechanic is very 'tight' and unforgiving, but then any good precise play is turned into a bit of a lottery by which cards you draw.

Well produced with good artwork (the petz are cute), but didn't like it and will endeavour not to play again.

Rating based on a first play with three players.

Will take a few games to wrap my head around this (like Dungeon Lords) but initial impression is favourable. 

I like the card options A LOT - quite a bit of depth there.

I'm almost about to say sorry for the low score but this game simply didn't grab me at all. Cute idea but the game rules are really non-intuitive and hard to explain. Once you actually play it fits together better but it's still fiddly like all Vlaada's designs seems to be.

The amount of planning done really doesn't match up to what you get from it considering the multiple random factors in the game.

I'll gladly play once more just to see if it makes more sense the second time around.

Finally got a chance to play this game.  It was worth the wait.  I didn't do terribly well at it but still enjoyed it quite a bit.  I think I like it better than Dungeon Lords.  It has a better flow to it and is equally thematic.  Like Dungeon Lords, it takes a game under your belt to understand what the heck you should be doing.  But I can see how explaining this game will be a lot easier than Dungeon Lords.  There isn't a complex order of combat operations and repercussions when all of a sudden you realize that everything has fallen apart.  Granted, this can still occur in DP if you press your luck with lots of older pets and resulting card draw...but luck can usually be mitigated.  I like the bidding for actions in DP more than the blind selection in DL.  Seems like a solid 8.

RATING: 7
I am fairly hesitant to rate Dungeon Petz because I am uncertain as to what my final opinion of it will be. I played it once at BGG.Con and quite enjoyed it, but it failed to really excite me like some of the other designs at the show did. Functionally it is another in the “Lets Put On A Show!” genre, where players prepare a presentation just in time for the big show to score victory points (other noteworthy games in the genre include Drum Roll, Pret-a-Porter, and Vinhos). As far the genre goes it is pretty good, on the same general level as Vinhos and a bit better than either Drum Roll or Pret-a-Porter. The theme is cute and the mechanics are pretty interesting. The worker placement/blind bidding hybrid is rather unique and appeals to me despite my normal aversion for blind bidding and the hand management/set collection involved in the generation and meeting of needs also results in plenty of tensely interesting decisions. I don’t see any flaws per se in the design and I expect that even though it lacks the ability to hold my attention like Agricola, Caylus, or Ora et Labora it will still sit as a solid second-tier worker placement game that warrants occasional play if not obsessive attention.

a table favorite. heavy theme that works well with mechanics. Beautiful artwork and lots of fun components. This is an absolute hit. mechanics work beautifully but are a little unwieldy to teach at first but everybody understands the rules as they are logical. One thing I would say about it is it would be nice if it was five players as the four player is onstricted.

RATING: 6
Only played once, but it seemed like a decent game. I'm not too familiar with the Dungeon Lords/Dungeon Petz theme, so I coudn't really get into it that way, but it seems like a playful, wacky, fantasy universe I could get into if I found the right game. Though I'm not sure this is that game. Not that I didn't have fun; the bidding-turn order mechanic is intrieguing, and trying to groom your pets for the various contests and shoppers was an interesting puzzle. I'm just not sure if this game has legs for me.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Está claro que Dungeon Petz no es para nada un mal juego (de hecho diría que está bastante bien), pero tiene dos inconvenientes que lo hacen totalmente incompatible con mi grupo de juego:

 -> Es complejo. Puede que cada elemento por separado sea más o menos fácil/intuitivo, pero Dungeon Petz tiene muchas fases y subfases, y tienes que recordar cómo se llevan a cabo cada una de ellas, las opciones que tienes disponibles y para qué sirve cada elemento y zona de los múltiples tableros: en conjunto, es uno de esos juegos en los que te pasas las primeras dos o tres partidas jugando "a trompicones" (con continuas paradas para preguntar/consultar el manual para ver cómo se hacía determinada cosa) y en los que resulta bastante difícil ver la situación actual de la partida (por lo que resulta más complicado elaborar estrategias).

 -> El tema. Está claro que lo más importante es la jugabilidad, pero no se puede (o al menos yo no puedo) separar por completo un juego de su temática... y en este caso, esta lo lastra enormemente. Ya las ilustraciones son tirando a infantiles (hay quien las llamaría simplemente "monas"), pero es que el tema se lleva la palma: cuando les empecé a explicar a los de mi grupo de juego que no solo había que alimentar a las mascotas, sino también jugar con ellas y limpiar sus caquitas... en fin, digamos que estamos acostumbrados a jugar a cosas más "serias" (supongo que para un eurogame esperamos más las típicas temáticas de comercio y/o agricultura).

Tengo claro que el fracaso de este juego es (en gran parte) culpa de mi grupo de juego, y por eso no le pongo demasiada mala nota. Desde luego se lo recomiendo a todos aquellos que estén acostumbrados a juegos complejos y que no les importe lo más mínimo la temática.

The evil dungeon lords in the area need monsters for their lairs, and you are just the pet shop owner to deliver them.  Raise fearsome, dangerous (not to mention cute) creatures from hatchlings until they are so powerful that you can barely contain them in their cages, and then sell them to dungeon lords for a tidy profit.

Provisional 7.5 for this one and I could see it going up to an 8 or more with additional plays.  There's a lot going on here with plenty to think about each turn.  How much do you want to commit to winning that important action?  How many groups do you think you'll need?  How will you care for that pet?  What is the show this turn?  How about the buyer?  It all seems to work together nicely though and it makes for a very interesting game.  The artwork is also fantastic, which gets it the extra 0.5.  Good game.

Long and procedural, but completely engaging the entire time.  The grouping of workers is a good concept, and so is the way cards are used to attempt to meet the needs of pets (and net you big points).   I also liked how you need to consider holding back some imps to play with the pets, restrain them, or clean cages.  There isn't a ton of long-range planning or large development arcs (as in Agricola).  Here you are mostly going for what will currently score well with a little foresight to the future.   The lack of downtime is a huge plus, given the relative length of the game (2-2.5 hrs).  The production is a bit cheap - the bits are small, the boards and pets are quite thin and flimsy.  I expect better for $65 retail.  Overall, a very enjoyable and unique middle-weight worker placement game.  Good stuff.

Tamagochi the boardgame; that’s really how it felt.  While the artwork and theme is very kiddie/silly, it is actually quite a heavy game.  I honestly, am not sure who the game is aimed at.  The art/theme aims itself it at little kids, but the mechanics are more at the level of (the original) Agricola.  My friends who like “Jamaica” could not get into the complexity of this game, and my friends who like Terra Mystica or Tzolk’in could never get into the theme (I couldn’t relate to it) and kiddie artwork.  As such, this game is a very strange beast with a very niche audience.   
There is a relatively high learning-curve as the game is not streamlined a quite a bit ‘fiddly.’    Generally the game just felt very convoluted for what it is.

Vlaada again! Another example of his genius and of his very personal approach to gaming. The theme is so sweet, the game is so beautiful and colorful.
You are a family of imps with a shop which is selling monsters pets. You'll have to be a great manager and beat the other players by having the most well-finished shop, the happiest pets, and be smart so that you can show your value to the recurring fairs, and sell to the incoming merchants the right pet for them. Hard to give the idea here, look it up, it's cute and fun.

Vlaada Chvátil is among my favorite designers because he is always trying something new.  To say that Chvátil is a quirky designer understates some of his more genius strokes, and while he doesn't always hit the mark, Dungeon Petz is one of those strokes.

At its heart, Petz is an economic game driven by bidding and worker placement coupled with a great sense of humor that requires players to say "poop" hundreds of times in a single session.  The mechanics integrate well with the theme, but the pure joy of the game comes from the inevitable discussions that occur at the table.  This is not a game where there is heavy player interaction outside of the bidding mechanism, but ultimately, you will get more out of it if you chat at the table.

Such as it is, the game itself is almost perfectly limited in every aspect.  That is to say, at no time could you possibly do everything you want to do; not only are you competing for spaces on the board to buy cages, pets, and extremely valuable food for your creatures, but you'll also be looking at the upcoming customers, the exhibition requirements, and those magical boosts that people often ignore.  While new players often want to get as many pets as possible, like any economic game, the best strategy is to specialize with a pet or two and work towards the upcoming exhibitions and customers while everyone else is distracted by the funny looking polka-dotted rhino thing.  For example, why bother getting the really angry critter with red cards when the buyer wants a really hungry one that poops a lot?  With so much on-board competition going and very limited resources available, there's a lot of great choices to make with every turn and the down-time is minimal.

This is absolutely a game everyone needs to play, and I will always be up for a session.

Excellent. The needs cards are a really interesting mechanic. I prefer this to Dungeon Lords.

For those who are curious about the differences, Dungeon Petz is worker placement + putting on a show. It's all about maximizing how best to prepare your pets for selling.

Dungeon Lords is action selection/programming + puzzle with a sprinkling of spatial building. It's all about preparing your dungeon to not be trampled by the incoming party.

Bidding for turn order in this game is delightful. Actions are incredibly scarce, especially the good ones, but so are your workers and cash, so making proper assignments is key. As a whole, the game has a little too much going on for my taste, and I often find myself gasping for air in the sea of bookkeeping, and less time racking my brain for optimal choices. This might become easier with experience, but despite its strong design, and potential for competitive play, its weight scares me away (especially if played with a crowd).

In so many ways, Dungeon Petz is a signature Vlaada Chvatil design. It features a thoroughly original and funny theme, which is closely melded together with sound albeit somewhat heavy mechanics, and thus creates a very satisfying experience both on the level of game-play and from the perspective of a fun atmosphere. Some may find that the game is too heavy and ponderous for the whimsical theme, but most gamers who enjoy the challenges of deeper gameplay will find that the light-hearted elements of the game are just the redemptive qualities that they need in order to draw them into the mechanics and ensure that this clever and amusing game for gamers doesn’t overstay its welcome.

Dungeon Petz didn't ultimately work for me and my group as we found the amount of planning was undone by who got the right cards when the right exhibitions and buyers came out (even with the advanced rules). On one hand, managing the pets' needs was fun and thematic, on the other, the rest of the game bogged down in calculations and forward planning. I'm not sure what type of game this wants to be, and the blind worker placement "bidding" just seems gimmicky. What does that even represent anyway? 

In the end, there seems to be an incongruence in what the game wants itself to be. Too fiddly for something lighter and too luck-based to be strategic.

Type: worker placement

I love the graphics and colors, and again the components are terrific, especially the pets. The mechanic for collecting cards is very unique, and I think the pet entertainment aspect is clever, as is an escaping pet, and the need to keep the cage clean. Very thematic. Planning ahead is vitally important. Rules are entertaining and well written.

My main complaint is that it is rule heavy, and therefore a hard game to pull out once in awhile.

We could not figure out what the arrows on the board mean which looks like an intended flow pattern--expansion? However, these "flow" arrows do not appear on the board pictured either on the bottom of the box or on the two page lay out in the rule book. I don't see a question about it in the forum either. (???)  EDIT: Note from Progmode to see sidebar on pg. 4--used when playing with less than 4 players. 

As in Dungeon Lords, the only player interaction is when you beat someone out of a placement. No fighting in this one. They are very different games, and I do prefer this one over Dungeon Lords.

A very involved and weighty euro game. The theme does an excellent job of tying the game together and as every action makes sense thematically it plays easier than it should.

The puzzle in taking care of your pets and matching the desires of the buyers is very nice. But the worker placement part is pretty standard and takes away from the rest of the experience. Beside that there is a lot of luck in the drawing of the cards. These things hamper an otherwise great game.

We've only managed two plays but I'm absolutely hooked.  Love the theme, the artwork, and most of all the gameplay.  Great ensemble!

EDIT: in fact we like it so much I've grabbed a "Dark Alleys" expansion already.

If there's a downside, it's the game length meaning it does not get to the table often enough.

This game is so much fun to play! What other game is about growing cute little extravagant pets (or,  in this case, petz),  taking care of their needs and cleaning their poop :-) 
Shure there are pure euro style mechanics that support the overall functionality of the game system, so, many players could think this is another soulless euro plenty of dry mechanisms, but, let me tell you this from my humble opinion: those opinions are wrong.
Dungeon Petz is one masterpiece of modern boardgame design, because it achieves what, apparently, is a very difficult task: it integrates perfectly theme with mechanisms! 
Your lovely monstrously petz will suffer if you forget to care for their necessities, otherwise, they will be happy and will make you feel proud when gaining exhibitions... And yes, you even could feel sad when a costumer choose one of your little magical babies to share the rest of his/her life in a new home, far from your petz store. 
Yeah, those cuties are far from being dry soulless victory point generators. THEY'RE ALIVE!

A lot of interesting mechanics, but ultimately this game is way too chaotic for my tastes. There is just too much going on and there is too much randomness for me to wrap my head around. Setting up and putting the game away is also a nightmare.

That's not to say it isn't fun, because it is. It just doesn't feel as rewarding to me as other similarly intricate games. I'll still play the heck out of it, but I won't suggest it myself.

I wish I could play this more often but the rules are so obtuse that it is difficult to play without having to reread the rule book.

Rating would go up if I could play it more often.

Urocze grafiki + sporo zasad, ale wszystko logicznie składa się w całość. Kolejny ulubieniec, przy którym można nawet popłynąć fabularnie i przywiązać się do swojego potwornego zwierzaczka - bo przecież tak trudno jest się z nim rozstać... Wcale nie tak łatwo zaspokoić wszystkie potrzeby zwierzaka, trzeba się sporo nagłowić, co zrobić. Czas rozgrywki jest proporcjonalny do tego, co można zrobić. Wymaga planowania wprzód. Na 2 osoby nawet z graczami widmo chodzi dobrze, choć można się trochę zirytować, że dobre pola są blokowane. Przyjemna, relaksująca, ale i doprowadzająca do parowania mózgu.

A heavier game but oozes so much theme non-gamers are more likely to try to get into it. As fun as worker-placement games can get, I think. Top-notch components for the imps and minions, but the boards tend to warp a bit. I've replaced the veggie and meat cubes with corn cobs and steaks from Meeplesource and the money discs with real coins, which makes it that much more fun.

This is the only serious strategy game my wife would clamor to play, if only for the theme.

RATING: 8
It's a very unique worker placement game, as one would come to expect from Vlaada. I really like the need cards, it gives tension and some neat risk management. The bidding is interesting, but I always suck at blind bidding so it's not my favourite mechanic. I like that all of the actions are good and the restrictions guides the blind bidding nicely. It feels like you always want more petz than you have, which is a bit frustrating, but I guess you wouldn't be able to handle many more anyway. It's an extremely interactive but still rather heavy euro, which is always a tough balance, but I think this game does it very well.

We've played this a few times.  We enjoy the theme.  My wife likes that she doesn't feel like her family is going to starve if she doesn't make the right moves (Agricola), but her pets tend to suffer a lot :P  Even though she has yet to win a single game, (scratch that, she won once), she always wants to play this one.  Part of me feels like it's 2 player solitaire.  Not sure how I feel about it, but it's a solid game in any case.

UPDATE:
The more you look into the future, the more planning and strategy you can think about.  We played our first 4p game and OMG crowded!  I couldn't feed the house plant!  WTH.  Makes me want the expansion for 4P games so there are more places to grab.

RATING: 9
Dungeon Petz is the second of designer Vlaada Chvátil's two subversive takes on the worker placement genre. Like its predecessor Dungeon Lords, workers are committed in secret, without knowledge of what opponents' workers are doing. And in both games, the worker placement and resource collection is only a prelude to the brain-twisting "puzzle phase" where you must figure out how to effectively use those resources.

I like Dungeon Petz significantly more than its predecessor Dungeon Lords for several reasons. (1) The worker placement method of Dungeon Petz produces fiercer competition and a greater feeling of tension. (2) Dungeon Petz allows for more planning ahead, and that planning is more demanding and more interesting. (3) Dungeon Petz is an easier game to teach because the "puzzle phase" has less rules overhead. (4) For me at least, the theme of Dungeon Petz is more fun and more colorful. One of your clients, for example, hopes to see as many colors of poop as possible when he visits your store.

Overall, I submit that Dungeon Petz is more of a gamer's game than Dungeon Lords, requiring a greater degree of finesse and more intense competition. At the same time it has a cleaner design, with fewer and more sensible rules.

Lovely artwork. There is one game mechanism that makes it work or break for you: The blind bidding that makes the outcome arbitrary. Either you don't get what you bidded for or you overpay it. Both results are very bad as there are only 5 rounds to play and any mistake will let you fall behind in a manner you won't catch up anymore. In Dungeon Lords you have a lot of options to choose but you can't take them all. In Dungeon Petz it is vice versa (you won't get them all). Some spots on the board are only available to one player each round. I am sorry to say but if the author believes making resources so scarce that this game should be still fun, he's wrong.
Furthermore this was the first game I had to deal with shit and cleaning it up. Once again: not as funny as the author believes...

The more I play other worker placement games, the more I appreciate how fresh and weird this one is. It also has a few more awkward rules than some others, not all of which are made easier to remember by the (genuinely funny and helpful) rulebook. Still, well worth the trouble and the time.

Vlaada seems to be trying hard to make a thematic Euro game, first with Dungeon Lords and now with this. I like both but Dungeon Lords is very fiddly, hard to teach, and long for a game with a fair element of randomness and very tight resources.

Dungeon Petz has some similar elements but the randomness seems less harsh and not having the relevant resources isn't quite as devastating. It is still somewhat fiddly and long to teach, but if you're sick of dry, themeless euros then this may be one for you.

Impression after 1 play:

I think I enjoyed this one a little more than Dungeon Lords.  The action selection phase was more streamlined and you didn't have to worry about picking the action at the optimal moment (i.e.  Being the 2nd player to choose in action).  In Dungeon Petz, there are several locations where only 1 player can reap the benefits.  

While I enjoyed my experience, I wasn't really sure I understood how all the levers worked to influence the game.  Albeit interesting, this game is not my cup of tea and I could never see myself owning it.

This is a harder game than what I normally go for. The rules to this game are beautifully thematic, but have many intricacies. It takes quite a few play and read throughs to get the hang of them.

I wasn't thinking I was going to like this game. I wasn't a huge fan of Dungeon Lords and there 'seemed' to be a lot a similarities to this one. But, other the the art work style and some shared pieces, it really doesn't have much in common. I was taught this game and within a few days had ordered my own copy. I really like the way the worker placement in managed in this game. Where you are effectively 'bidding' for placement order or trading it off for more actions.

Dungeon pets is amazing. Another great Vladaa design. What I love about Vladaa is how he select a theme first and design the mechanics around it. You never feel like themes are pasted on his games.

D.A. Regalo de Yera 2014. 

Es un euro, de pensar mucho, y elegir correctamente las acciones y los recursos... cuidando de unos animalitos que parecen salidos de un cruce de pokemon con dungeons & dragons. 

si, original es un rato. y ademas de eso es un euro de esos de darle al coco a hervir y muy cuidado en las mecanicas. 

la tematica es chocante, y algunos elementos de la mecanica, tambien (hay que comprarles jaulas a los bichos cumpliendo caracteristicas tales como tenerlos entretenidos o retener su rabia, limpiar las caquitas - literalmente - y cosas similares). los bichos son muy monos (la debilidad de los niños... bueno, de aquellos a los que les gusten las cosas con cuernos, tentaculos y dientes puntiagudos). el juego en si, al principio no te terminas de creer que es un euro de esos duros al nivel de agricola o tzolkin... pero lo es, y hay que calcular y pensar muy bien las acciones para lograr la victoria final (basicamente, tener los bichos lo mejor cuidados posible, que no enfermen ni sufran, y que ganen exposiciones y los compren a buen precio). 

es un excelente euro, quiza no sea el mejor, pero si uno muy bueno, y muy original.

Many of Vlaada's games are just on the cusp of being too long (Mage Knight, Dungeon Lords), whereas some games are clever but clearly too long (Graenaland, Prophecy). This, sadly, is firmly in the latter camp.
Perhaps there is just too much puzzle for me. It's fun, and I like the action selection (blind auction meets worker-placement), but the card play is rather swingy and occasionally tedious.
But man, are the pets cute.

First of all, the graphic desing is the best I have ever seen and extremely detailed. All the pieces are absolutely beautiful starting from the box art. The rule book is colourful and immerses into the theme of the game explaining the rules in a humorous fashion that will surely put a smile on your face. This game is clearly a labour of love.

The gameplay might not be for casual gamers since there are tons of little rules that seem random at first but in reality everything makes perfect sense. For example, minions can be sent off to market place with money but money can not be sent alone since it doesn't have legs. Cages need at least 2 minions to carry them since they are heavy. When monsters at market aren't sold, they are discarded and mysteriously the amount of meat at sale is increased. Little details like this may not be everyone's cup of tea but I love them since they make the world of the game so rich and enhance the experience of dealing with monsters.

Also, on top of being detailed, the game can be brutally competitive when everyone is fighting for the same scarce resources. Another thing I love since most of my games are nice eurogames. If only you have a group of friends willing to take the time to memorise all the little rules then I can not recommend this enough. A masterpiece of a game!

The only cons I can think of is that the final scoring requires quite a lot of calculations which can be a bore. Also in between rounds there is a lot to do when you have to clean the market place to put new stuff in and make sure to bring your minions back from different tasks.

What a fantastic game. Brilliantly conceived mechanics that compliment a wonderful, unique theme. It’s a little tricky to explain / teach, but it’s by no means a “complex” game. Everything flows logically and thematically.

It’s filled with strategy and brain-burning moments. Sure, there’s a little bit of “luck” thrown in there, but after all, you’re trying to raise unpredictable monsters! In a nutshell, I love it – one of the most original games in my collection.

There seems to be a trend in worker placement games lately towards giving each worker a different value, and allowing each worker to be further improved in value. Lancaster and Strasbourg are two that work in a similar fashion. Of those three, this seems to be the weakest game. However, the worker placement element is the strongest part of this game. It creates interesting decisions and even requires a bit of psychology in predicting both the value of your opponents' workers, as well as what resources they will want to take first. 

Unfortunately, once the workers are placed and resources are taken, players will spend a fair amount of time staring at their hands of cards and puzzling out the optimal way to proceed. There is randomness, but it shows up BEFORE you have to make any decisions. This may be good news to some people because then your decisions are about how to adapt to this randomness. However, I'd prefer the other way, where you make your best guess or take a risk, and then see how the randomness affects you. I don't say that as a general statement about all games, just this one in particular because of the downtime and silent puzzling it creates. There are actually two places in the rules where it essentially asks you very nicely to please take your turn quickly and to be patient with those who don't. Good advice in any game, but it's an indicator of a rampant problem here that I think could have been fixed with a different design choice.

Ultimately, if you like that puzzling aspect (which was also seen in Dungeon Lords), this may work for you. The randomness is a bit more controlled and the worker placement creates more decisions. It seems to play a bit faster too. I would just prefer to play something where the decisions are more intuitive rather than calculable.

Dungeon Petz probably has one of my favorite themes that I've come across so far! What savage can't get into the idea of raising (super adorable) baby monsters for potential loving dungeon masters! But don't be fooled by the theme, the game is super heavy for the idea it is trying to get across! Which is of course not a bad thing, but be warned. I think the game is the best at 4, but the dummy player helps makes the lower player count games play well, also.

I had fun playing, but there are a ton of rough edges in the design.  Unique WP game, for what that's worth.  The simultaneous bidding and the fact that you dont draw need cards until after the WP phase each round means that there isn't really any long term strategizing possible, but people still get AP trying to maximize, which might turn me off in the long run.  Want to play at least once more to see how bad that really is.

What a great premise! You are an Imp family building a pet shop. You take care of pets that you will eventually sell while collecting money that your family sends you that they were able to collect from their Masters in the Dungeon Lord game. I love the connection with Dungeon Lord while still being it's own game. 

It is very reminiscent of Agricola for me because you are trying to bid and compete for your actions.

RATING: 5
This is quite a clever worker placement game, unfortunately it's wrapped up and delivered in a way which makes it utterly awful. Complicated enough that mums asking the same question 4 times over after only one drink, the graphics and theme are far too out of touch with the people who would like these mechanics and the mechanics are way out of touch with the people who would like the theme.

I felt sorry for Chris explaining it - with a cobbled together edition of the English rules (given that his game was German). Especially as he was never really allowed to explain it properly. I hate trying to give an explanation and constantly being interrupted with questions which tends to result in you getting knocked out of the stride of your explanation and results in you either missing bits out, getting flustered or just going round in circles - which results in your fellow players saying "well this is waaaaaaay too complicated".

It's a shame that's what happened here as I can see this is mechanically a good game. I'm just not sure I can stomache the theme or the need to develop a story on each turn.

For anyone who says an Euro doesn't need theme then they must experience Dungeon Petz. The mechanics and flavor are so perfectly amalgamated that they just build upon each other.

The theme impeccably supports the rules and brilliantly explains the mechanics (e.g. losing no points when you're unknown, bigger pets need more tending, etc). There isn't anything glaringly pure mechanics such as roundels, movement resource, color charts, etc. 

Likewise the well-throught gameplay rules build upon the theme (e.g. cannot remove suffering from pets, takes 2 imps to carry a cage, etc.) and all done without relying on chunks of flavor text or detailed miniatures. 

A benchmark example of masterful concoction of theme with mechanics that results in a cocktail that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Strongly reminiscent of At the Gates of Loyang, though I haven't seen too many people making this comparison. It's about satisfying a contract attached to a notional entity; of course, Dungeon Petz, as a Chvatil game, is much more chaotic and has a very different theme.  (1 play)

I really like the theme and the artwork for this one. The mechanics are great and fit well (even though I'm not the greatest worker placement fan, taking care of the petz is so neat!). But beware, the game is much more complex than it seems to be! I prefered the game two-player than 4-player for now (because of the downtime and game-length) and have yet to play a 3-player game.
About the expansion, I like everything about it, except the Facilities which kind of really add unecessary complexity to the game IMO.

Don't let the lighthearted theme fool you.  Dungeon Petz is a complicated game that requires lot of planning ahead.  The theme is great and definitely comes across when you play, although the board art is far too cluttered and in my opinion actually impedes the game. Overall, I want to like this game more than I do, but it's quite fiddly, has a lot of rules, and it's very difficult to teach.

Such a fun game! 
Having your own pet store, I can't think of a theme that is more up my alley.
For such a light hearted theme, it really is a heavy game.
My first play I had a hard time keeping my pets in their cages and giving them the right need cards.
The night even ended with a major headache.
Now it is easier to grasp and the game flows more fluently.

Artwork is still pretty cool and there are alot of little details on the main board alone. Like the imps playing a copy of Dungeon Lords.

Only downside is that after the Imp placement it is just a puzzle game for everyone dealing out your needs.

Solid worker placement with a silly but well integrated theme.  Very much enjoyed it.  Only major flaw with this and dungeon lords seems to be the fact that it's really designed for 4 players exactly.  I've only played these once each, but I think I enjoyed this one more.  Rating could creep up with more plays

Very fun and kind of unique worker placement from Vlaada Chvatil. The theme is amazing (buying and caring for crazy monsters in hopes to sell them for the highest price to an owner of a dungeon). The art is amazing. The components are amazing - especially the little goblin figures and the monster tiles with rotating needs.

I held out for this rather than getting Dungeon Lords (having enjoyed that following the original Dungeon Keeper computer game) and wasn't disappointed. I love the theme, the art and the core mechanism of cards for needs, which seems so often to throw up agonising decisions that make any successful sales sweet. Having explained the rules quite a few times, they are fiddly, but enough people don't seem to mind that.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (June 2012)

As usual, I was the rules reader of my game group, however I made a BIG mistake teaching and playing the game so my first game was awful. I need to play this again soon to reevaluate my rating. I had very high hopes for this one because it’s a Vlaada design but maybe this will be his first game I don´t like. 

The theme is too cute for me, in Dungeon Lords the theme was funny but darker, here, it continues to be funny but it is too sweet for my taste and for what I was expecting. The rules, as always, were hilarious. It seems to be a lighter game than Dungeon Lords.

For now I prefer to play Pret a Porter or Vinhos over this one.

After more plays, I have come to appreciate this game a lot! Vlaada strikes again :D. The theme has won me over and now I enjoy it completely, from the art, to the rulebook, to your lair. Everything is great. This is a worker placement game with a fresh take, I LOVE that you need to bid with minions and gold for the order of each action in the game. I also really like how the players get involved in the game, if a pet suffers, the owner of that pet also suffers. This makes for a fun game as you need to be observing your enemies and, thus, I don’t feel any downtime. With the random disposition of pets and dungeon lords (thus how much meat and vegetables appear each round), the game has a lot of replay value. For now, each game has felt different. 

Dungeon Petz has a lot of tension and interesting decisions with any number of players (although I prefer to play it with 4).

Still I prefer Dungeons Lord over this one but it`s been awhile since I played DL so my opinion can change.

Bottom line, a very good worker placement and a game I want to buy in the future. I won’t say no to a game of Dungeon Petz. A true gamer´s game.

I continue to like Dungeon Petz, but the luck factor is higher than I initially thought. I have seen now in a couple of games, that a player prepared himself for the need of his pets and the cards he drew weren’t the most likely ones. When this happens a lot, you will lose no matter what you do and that’s not a good experience for me.

Still I like the game a lot.

One of 2011`s favorites.

RATING: 7
Dungeon Petz is in many ways a typical Vlaada Chvatil game.  There is a basic problem to be solved - to keep pets happy, healthy and valuable - and a worker placement phase not to mention many detailed rules to determine exactly how players go about solving it.

This game's greatest innovation is the bidding system for worker placement.  I am not a fan of blind bidding as a general rule, and neither are most of the gamers I play with.  However, the ability to group one's workers to maximize either quality or quantity of actions is a brilliant twist on the standard worker placement action draft.

Truthfully I didn't find myself inspired by much of the rest of the game.  The shows for buyers and dungeon lords might be interesting but instead I found myself with a pet mismatched to their interests, through what I perceived as no fault of my own since I couldn't see their interests yet.

I suspect that, like Dungeon Lords, this game won't really shine on a first play since the rules weight is so heavy.  Many Vlaada games are worth playing repeatedly because there is a great experience inside.  I don't intend to seek out that experience with Dungeon Petz since even though it may be better than Dungeon Lords I've more plays invested in the earlier title.

A good fun idea of raising pets entering competitions and selling them on to potential owners that is done in a very euroy way.  There are far to many things to look at if you are going to try and maximize your score which will lead to AP, so I find it better to play as a light game.  Unfortunately because there are so many things to track it can get bogged down with flipping tiles, placing tiles, drawing cards etc etc

The blind bidding portion of separating your imps and gold is simply ok.  As expected, there can be a steep risk/reward aspect to making too small or large of a group.  Overall, it works fine, but that's not the selling piece of the game.

What is?  The pet's 'needs' mechanic!  Very, very elegantly put together.  There are 4 decks of cards - each dedicated to one of four primary needs a pet may have.  Green (food/poop), Red (anger), Yellow (play), and Purple (Magic).  You will ultimately decide what your pet's needs are, but as it's card-driven, you may not always draw what you'd expect.  Very thematic!  Each pet has tendencies, but as card decks tend to do, they illustrate how your pet can have a mind of its own by not behaving as advertised.  This really is a great thematic component to the game.

Points, or Reputation, is primarily scored via exhibitions and selling your pets.  Both, exhibitions and customers, offer reputation based on your pets' needs on a specific turn.  So there is a balancing act between getting points via exhibitions, getting points via selling pets to customers, and finally maintaining a healthy pet and clean cage.

It adds up to a relatively light, but very thematic and fun 'take care of your pet' game.  The only downside is the amount of time required to teach a newbie.  While it is quite intuitive once you 'get it', you have no choice but to explain it all in order to 'get there'. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great game where the theme fits the gameplay extremely well. Worker-placement with the added complexity of having to manage the needs of your pets as well as prepare them for the numerous competitions. Not as complex as Dungeon Lords, more random (although I see that as a part of its charm) and very good fun.

I stuggled to learn this game with my brother and his wife. It took a while to grasp some of the mechanics. By the end of the game I have a good understanding of the game but for my brother this was not his game. A game can only shine with the right group and I think this game will shine in the future. I can see so much potential but the main drawback it learning this game or teaching it to a new player. I will try teaching this to my wife and see if teaching this game can get easier.

This is an initial reaction after one play. This is a good worker placement game, but the genius of the game is in the need cards and contests/buyers. It's a tight game and pretty unforgiving, but it's a lot of fun. 

Edit: I dropped my rating, not really through any fault of the game, but after subsequent plays, I really feel like the game is just okay. It's cute, and I love the aesthetic and idea of it, but it feels a little too much like a to-do list to me. I guess I just like my Euros a little more puzzle-y.

played once.  Once was enough.

By no means is this a bad game, however, it is not the type of game that my group and I tend to enjoy.  So many moving parts (which is okay usually), but with not enough time to address the inherent randomness within the needs for the animals.  We felt that we were unable to mitigate that luck factor enough, which made the game less enjoyable for us, even though the comedy in the game-- as well as the theme-- is great in such a complex Euro.  

All in all, there are many others who will enjoy this effort more than my family, my group, and, myself.  For that reason, it goes.

Was really hoping to like this more than I did.  Great production.

Not enjoyable, you have to spend too much time during bidding phase worrying about later phases because you need to know how many imps you need to fulfill the pets needs, how much food you have, etc... all the information is spread everywhere so its really tedious to look it all up. Also the z at the end of the name is stupid.

RATING: 8
Very good game! It really presents you with lots of choices that are quite agonizing but also a lot of fun. The theme is adorable, although not all the game mechanics really feel thematic, the overall cuteness of tending to monstrous pets is really appealing to me.

There is a lot of worker placement and this is where one of the clever game mechanics comes in. Players have imp workers and everyone secretly sorts their imps into groups behind their player screens. For example I might arrange mine into a group of 3, two groups of 2 and one group of 1. Players can also use gold to add an imp of strength to the group. This is almost the only use of gold. Once everyone has their groups they are revealed simultaneously and whoever has the largest group places first, ties going to the start player and left-wise thereof. So it's a kind of hybrid bidding worker placement thing. Kind of like a lot of different games but unique in it's own way.

The other really nice mechanic is the tending of pets. Each pet must be assigned a certain number of cards that are of specific colours. This happens each round and players draw all of these cards just before assigning them. They will also have one of each colour in hand from the previous round. Then assignments must be made. Depending on what cage your pet is in and how much food and what customers might be coming you try to optimize the allocation of the cards. This is usually very painful, in a good way.

I really enjoy the game a lot. It is hard like Vlaada's other big games but it doesn't feel as heavy or intricate. I like Dungeon Lords but I never fell in love with it because of how complicated the combat was. It often felt like a puzzle (much like Mage Knight does) however Dungeon Petz feels nothing like this. You have hard decisions but they don't weigh you down too much.

The rule book is a bit long but the game doesn't play like it, so if that's scaring you away or the fact that you didn't enjoy Vlaada's other big games I would give this one a try.

I need to play this again but...

I left feeling slightly frustrated with the game. It appears to offer a lot of choices but i'm not entirely sure that those choices had a great deal of impact on the scoring. While the action selection mechanism is ok I think that too much importance is placed on procuring the 'right' pet to be able to sell to the Dungeon Lords - if you miss out then you will struggle to make up points elsewhere. Added to this is that you will often have to take a pet 'blind' and grow it for 2 seasons before selling, but at the point of sale you have no idea if it will be worth anything.

So all in all, i'm not rushing back to this one.

This is a fantastic game, but it is HEAVY. Deceptively so. Taking care of your monsters and cages, etc is a lot of fun. But there is SO MUCH game around that that it can be a lot to keep track of. It's not so bad for me but...Erin has never won this game and I have a hard time imaging her ever doing so. It simply requires a level of attention that She doesn't often give to our games. But that theme is SO GOOD...

2011 was the year of exhibition-themed games (Vinhos, Drum Roll, Pret-a-Porter, Air Show, Pergamon) and Dungeon Petz is the highest-ranked of them. Chvatil again managed the trick to create a Eurogame that ranks high amongst thematic gamers and as of writing this comment is #20 in thematic games on BGG.
On the mechanical (Euro) side, it's a worker placement game with one central simultaneous decision in how many groups players want to divide up their workers. For example, six workers can be split up in six singles for the maximum amount of actions, two groups of three workers each or any other combination. The larger the group, the earlier it acts. This mechanism coupled with very limited action spots works perfectly.
On the thematic side, players have to fulfil the needs of monsters they nurture. Each turn, players caringly reveal the cards they have associated with each monster and tell small stories. The successful thematic integration helps to get beyond the processional and sometimes drawn out flow of the game.
Victory is decided in best fulfilling the demands of exhibitions and buyers. There's some luck in getting the right cards at the right time but enough possibilities to mitigate or at least reduce adverse effects.
Nice enough game although I'm not sure if it really is a 7 for me or if I'm a bit generous due to winning the game.

I like the idea of a simpler Dungeon Lords, a game I wanted to like, but didn't devote enough time to get it down or teach it right.

However, I've come to realize that I am probably just not the target audience for games like this. I like the idea of having pets that get increasingly difficult to control. But why can't they be regular pets? The fantasy theme makes it harder for me to like the game.

But the main problem is the large amount of rules. Once you get going, the game is not overly complicated, but it simply isn't worth spending so much time learning rules without a commitment to give the game a few tries, which is probably what you need to fairly evaluate it.

A cute taking-care-of-pets game from one of my favorite designers. There really is a lot going on in this game. And too many fiddly rules. Its a good game, not too complicated, but massive amount of upkeeping.

Ultimately what I think fails here is the imp grouping process. It just doesn't seem to fit very well with the flow of the game. The game becomes more about blind bidding than it does about worker placement. A very weak, tacked-on mechanic.

This is a theme comes first game, but at the same time also mechanically not bad at all. It looks good and the actual game is well integrated on the board. However there are two things that are bogging the overall experience down a bit. Firstly especially on the later rounds the game is superbly prone to AP when assigning a huge fan of cards to a bunch of monters. Secondly even with that huge fan of cards you might be out proper options not just for limiting damages but also for scoring. Notable cons are also the lousy and uneven turn order handicap and the fact that two players are for sure getting minus points for imps not at home in the end.

First off, hilarious theme draws me in. But the twists on auctions and WP are also nice, and the whole cage/animal/food system is somewhat new. However, the best part of the game is distributing your creatures' needs, trying to optimize for the contests and clients, keeping rarer cards for future turns, this makes for a much nicer game than a stale, overused "feed your stuff". Decisions to be made, optimization to be implemented, fun to be had!

Played last night. Glad I did. But doubt I'd request it again. Thematic, very coherent (I'd never read the rules/watched a play through and the rules were mostly intuitive). However, if a game is going to be this long I think it needs something more. This is the same thing over and over for 6 rounds!

Caveat: Not sure it's fair to rank with just one play and that too not even a full one.

The pets are soo cute. The game itself is pretty fun too with lots of stuff to do and not enough time to do it. Might suffer from too long syndrome (like Dungeon Lords) but further plays might speed up.

The core of the game is matching up needs (behaviour) with requirements on one hand and demand on the other. Requirements are collected through a semi-blind action drafting procedure. Demands come in two different types of set which may or may not match each other in any particular round. The catch is that you can only profit to the extent that your cards allow you to bridge the gap between capacity and demand. There are ways to reduce the luck of the draw, but not everyone will have access to these (or everyone will have just a little). So it's possible to set up a potentially huge payoff only to miss out because instead of drawing manageable, profitable cards you draw non-manageable, non-profitable ones and have to bend over double just to avoid penalties that would reduce your role in the game to occasional hate drafter. Three players worked fine, but for each player below four, the drafting procedure takes a hit from the scripted action blocking. Playing time is OK. Ambience is endearing but I can see how it might give some people an allergic reaction.

I'm not much of a fan of most of Chvatil's work - I often find his games unforgiving without being fun, procedural without being exciting, and/or pressurized without any sense of real accomplishment. Well, score one for Vlaada - Dungeon Petz is by far my favorite of his games I've played. It's rewarding, it's reasonably easy to pick up, it plays in a bit less time than Dudgeon Lords or Through the Ages. 

But I think what I like most, what makes this game so much better - and this is faintly ridiculous - is the ultrafun theme. Who doesn't want to be a monster salesman? It's really entertaining that there's an ogre that wants some of your animals for manure, and a lich who thinks animals that eat are gross. For some reason it feels less like a cascading series of disasters than its similarly themed predecessor, even though it actually is just as tough and finicky. For some reason, you can just take it less seriously when you're raising a gigantic magical monster than when you're protecting your shit from being stole by armored ruffians.

Probably the most thematic Euro/auction game ever. It is a step up from Dungeon Lord without the combat system that many Euro people hate. It is family friendly as petz do not die -- they only go to the farm and live happily after while a piece of meat mysteriously appears in the meat booth.

RATING: 8.5
Cool and funny worker placement game. It is fun to feed and grow those little monsters until they leave the home to work for their dungeon lord. The game makes sense and rulebook explains things in an intuitive way so people understand the game quite easily. Enjoyed playing this one quite well but felt it was a bit long with 4 players.

2017-07-20 - 6 - It's an OK eurogame, but not too special. You basically do the same round by round as opposed to Dungeon Lords, where you really feel your development and I like it much more. Dungeon Petz is a nice game with great and relevant theme, but I will rather lean to something else on most occasions.

Quite involved in so much as there are plenty of rules, but the game flows well enough and doesn't seem rules bound when you play it. Enjoyed my first play a great deal and am looking forwards to playing again.

I don think its as much fun as Lords, and maybe thats due partly to my familiarity with Lords. There just seems less to do in this one.

With more rules for a worker placement game than I've seen elsewhere, DP takes a while to explain to new players. The theme is fantastic and the variety of pets available seems to allow different strategies to take each game. I think I enjoyed playing this more than Dungeon Lords, but they have many similarities.

Rating after one play.  Great game and great fun, but much heavier than the cute art would indicate.  Loved the secret and simultaneous grouping of imps to bid for turn order. Very clever.  Also clever use of the dummy imp.  An overall stellar design, but just too long for my tastes.  If we could play to the 90 minutes it says on the box, including setup and breakdown, my rating would probably jump to a 9.  

Needs more plays.

The spiritual successor to Dungeon Lords, this is a much friendlier and IMO, better game.

Pretty eyecandy artwork and a very fun,enjoyable theme, which is all icing on the cake on its own. But fortunately it has stellar and a innovative bidding twist incorporated into its worker placement gameplay to back it up.

Plays well with all player counts, 2, 3, and 4. This is a must own I think for anyone who is a fan of Vlaada Chvatil and/or eurostyle gameplay.

Fun on its own, even better with the Dark Alley expansion, do yourself a favor and give it a try.

I admit it, this game pushes the boundaries of heavyness for me. It's not that I don't get it, I just don't enjoy playing a game from the rule book. Certainly a well crafted game, it is, however, just not for me. Traded away for Rum and Bones.

RATING: 8
Only one play so far, so this might change. But...it's a Vlaada game; lots to do, not enough time to do it in, punishing consequences if you don't plan properly, often a few turns ahead. The cute theme is great, but I'm not sure if it's great enough that this will see a lot of play.

Update: Having played a few more times, I'm definitely warming to it. It's actually a bit less punishing than some other Vlaada games as getting too much suffering or even losing a pet can be overcome (sometimes). Every time I introduce it to someone new they have an awful time in their first game though, which I imagine puts some people off.

As with any Vlaada game, it can get fiddly at times, but my family and I love this game. The cuteness of the board, pieces and cards easily overcomes the steep learning curve for my wife and daughter. I enjoy the myriad choices I have to make, and the fact that there is not one clear path to victory.

For instance, in a three player game in which the other players were fighting it out for the platform, I spent my imps and gold maximizing my performance on the last two auctions and won. Great game!

now THAT is a well done theme. It's unique, fun, and well thought out.  Better than dungeon lords, I do believe so.  It touches all the emotions, and you really do feel sad when a pet dies.  and you can feel angry when it puts your cute little minions in the hospital.

the only way this game could be better is if the pieces ran around and did things by you yelling at them.  

A masterpiece and a half.  But don't be fooled by the design, this game is no cakewalk. It's DEEEEEEEP.

Under the cutesy art is a fairly arid, heavy and traditional euro.  The whole idea isn't that complex, but there are *a lot* of rules and a lot of time is spent 'running' the game.  Looking at the player aid (at the top of the player boards) is enough to discourage even reasonably courageous gamers.  The novel thing is variable worker placement where you have to balance priority with number of placements.  Relatively few of the available spots are really valuable at any given point and competition is very (almost too) stiff (with 4 players at least).

Our 1st game took 3 hours, and I would say the weight is higher than Dungeon Lords (same designer).  Additionally, it's a completely different game so don't make too many assumption about ties between the two.  I rarely say this, but this felt a bit too heavy for it's own good.  The stakes and overall concept/workings would probably be better supported by more streamlined proceedings.

Still a good, if heavy, euro that's worth looking into if that's your kind of things.  But do not be fooled by the cute cuddly child-friendly pets, this isn't a kids game, it ain't light, and it flows like slime.

RATING: 7
This is a worker placement, card management game with some angst in the decision making.  You certainly want to avoid competing in the type of food other players need if possible as that is one way players can really be nasty.  One has to manage poop, feed their pets, play with them, maintain their magical abilities without going too far and allowing them to mutate, and keep the angry pets in their cages.  The key aspect to the game is managing your pets needs which is managed through the five types of card where there is a certain type of distribution of the different needs.  This game is certainly much more accessible than the predecessor Dungeon Lords which can be extremely painful to teach.

Yesssss!  Another Vlaada Chvatil title. 'Nuff said.

Well, I can say more. This is a cute game, light, and unpredictable in a fun way. You do your best, but sometimes you just can't get your pet to behave for that sale! (you might just draw the wrong needs cards, even with a statistical advantage)

The game flows very well, except for one thing. The immigration line. That's where you get your new workers. You have a silent bid for first move each turn, effectively. If a player gets outbid just a little bit by different people each turn, she can get shut out of workers the whole game and that can be harsh.

A funny, but medium to heavy worker placement game where you are raising baby monsters to sell them.  They each have needs that you are trying to satisfy, you must feed and clean up poop in cages.  Yes, there is poop in this game.  

There are regular shows where you show off your pets and score points.  

This ought to be a great family game especially with poop in it, but it is too heavy for little kids who would find this funny.  

The game reminds me a bit of Pret-a-Porter but I like Pret-a-Porter better.

Oh, it's sooo cute!  That being said, it feels like a chore.  I'm not raising monsters, I'm working the mechanics.  This game is relatively simple, but feels needlessly complex.

More interaction and options in the marketplace portion of the game, as would be found with more than 2 players, might benefit the game.  It would also significantly lengthen it, though.

There are more complex engine-building Euro's that I find more fun than this, like, say, Keyflower, City of Iron, or Agricola.  This title just lacks payoff for the time investment, at least with 2 players, in my opinion.

My wife appears to enjoy the puzzle aspect of the Need cards and fulfilling those needs.  In that respect, it seems to fill a similar niche as [b][thing=65781][/thing][/b].  Yes, really.  But as much as I enjoy that aspect of the game, it fails for me in a couple other areas.  One, I dislike the randomness of it.  While there are short term strategies to be found - selecting petz that suit your pens or pens to suit the future growth of a pet, selecting petz that meet future buyers or shows, these strategies only carry forward two or three turns.  So, on the whole, the game feels much more tactical than strategic and there's no epic feel to it.  When I'm done, I can't even tell you which petz I raised.  How'd the story of my pet shop go?  Sorry, but I've already forgotten.

90 minutes?!? No way. It takes 3 hours.
Fortunately the game is deep enough to justify the long playing time. There are downtime, but you need that time to think your strategy through - it's a very complex game!

The little monsters, the magic items and especially the buyer personalities, makes me dream (yet again) of a Dungeon Lords expansion. 
There would be something cool in assuming one of the DP personalities in a DL game, and gaining points for how well you manage to outfit your dungeon according to that personalitys preferences.
New monsters, adventureres, traps, rooms and magic items goes without saying, but they should of course all be designed with the personalities in mind.
(Of course it needs more, but this would be a start)

Suprisinginly good game with a lot of theme in a Eurogame, at least one step up from Dungeon Lords. Good worker placement mechanism and lots of player interactions due to limitied spots for each action and competion over resources (i.e. pets and cages and special cards). Also a cool feature with exibitions each round, and I always like games with negative feedback if you dont fulfill the requirements of the game. The mechanism with grouping imps for turn order is really clever that brings a further dimension to the game. In my oppinion it is also a alot of fun playing Dungeon Pets. My only concern is that the cards adds pretty much randomness, that pretty muck decides the outcome, to the game. The game seem to have very high replayabilliy potential. 

Rating set after one game, might change in either direction.

"Que bonito es ese mapache papa, quiero uno". esta frase se repite todos los dias (bueno, 1 vez al mes o al año) delante de alguna tienda de mascotas en el mundo.

Que ocurriría si en vez de humanos, ¿fueramos demonios y señores del mal? tenemos acaso la exclusiva? la respuesta es NO. Ellos tambien necesitan de pequeños seres de los que preocuparse, entrenar a su imagen y semejanza e incluso presumir de ellos delante de los demas. Pero, como ocurre tal proceso? ¿quien se encarga de que esto pueda ser posible?

este hecho es el que resuelve Dungeon Petz. 

Tomamos el rol de un grupo de goblins, conocedores de las exigencias de los señores infernales. Deben conseguir, criar y cuidar todo tipo de criaturas que enamoren a los mas insignificantes y petreos corazones y conseguir asi un negocio altamente lucrativo.

Compite ante un jurado (o sobornalos), construye jaulas para criar a tan bellas criaturitas demoniacas.

Very tight design, that's what I love about this game. All aspects of the game connect and interact with each other well. The theme is nice and there are different pathways for success. It's really easy to interfere with other players on the main board and it's often difficult to get what you want at the time you want it. It requires careful planning and being aware of what you need. 

I also really like the card aspect of this game. The way you fill your pets needs is important because you have to time it right to please certain customers so you have to plan their use.

Fun game, both the theme and the artwork have a great tongue-in-cheek feeling about them.
It's long however, while everything is nice there is just too much. I feel that a few too many nice things have been crammed into one box, that stops it from being really great.

Although it has some unique mechanics, this game still kind of blends into the whole worker placement genre for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great theme, excellent mechanics. Eurogame, so very little interaction.

The rules are deceptively easy to learn. The rulebook is well written and fun to read. The seeming complexity of the game is greatly alleviated by very good theme integration - the rules thus feel very intuitive. This game is excellent even for some non-gamers.

I am not very good at worker placement games. Thus, theme becomes crucial to me. I play to win, but even losing badly can be fun with Dungeon Petz.

I bought this game in the hopes that my kids would join me in some monster raising fun, alas it was too difficult for my teenage boys and they were quickly...bored...as it is difficult to compete with video games. However my game friends did find this more fun than first thought. My only complaint is the soup of icons. It took a few plays to get used to them but with the help of the rule book, we have prevailed. Overall it was a good addition to my collection.

RATING: 8
Having the manic little imps from Dungeon Keeper compete in the raising and selling of variously cute pets is so great an idea that it could have survived on somewhat derivative mechanics. That’s not how Chaatvil designs his games, apparently, and so the great idea and the accompanying great artwork come with a new twist on worker placement, where you essentially perform a blind bit for placement priority, and a system of determining the needs of your beasties that is very thematic and feels quite fresh, too.

Judging from our first run, it all works together very well, underpinning the enthusiastic sales pitches, the pet show jury-rigging and the (uniformly bad) poo jokes that were flying around our table with a satisfying range of strategic options and round-to-round finagling of plans. Especially recommended if you liked Dungeon Lords, since the games play very differently whilst being of similar weight and luck/strategy balance, I’d say.

Traded for Russian Railroads, 12/2016. It looks fun and inviting, and has some neat aspects, but is fiddly and feels a little long too. Still good though.

Quite innovative worker placement game, especially the aspect of selecting groups. Not sure if it adds much in strategic depth though, may be needlessly funky. Also the graphics and messiness here are definately holding this one back, it's clunky and you overlook stuff because it's so messy.

Initial rating is 8 after 3 plays (2 4p, 1 3p). Intuitive, quick, great rules and bits.  Lighter than Dungeon Lords in some ways but less so in others.  Less luck than in Dungeon Lords.  I like them both!

Latest game demonstrated that one player can get partially "shut out" on pets and have no chance.  Happened twice in a three game set.  Rating drops a point.

Easily my favorite worker placement game. Every aspect of this game is executed so perfectly. Reading through the manual is fun, and exciting, AND teaches you the game. The rules themselves make sense, so if you can't remember the rule, trying to think about what the rule would logically be is usually the right answer. The main board and player boards are beautiful to look at, and informative to the game. Every game piece fits perfect. And lastly, the pets! The cute little monster pets you take care of are amazing! This game gets you so invested in taking care of your pets, and giving them the best owners. It also works perfectly as a 2-player game, which makes it a great couples game. My wife and I will definitely be playing this one for years to come.

Huge disappointment! This game seemed to have so much promise. Unfortunately, it fell flat and ultimately became frustrating for 3 reasons.

1. It's fiddly--there is a setup/replenishment phase in every round (5 times including original setup). Having to check off each area to see if it's setup right gets easier as you go, but is somewhat of a pain.
2. Too many rules--There are just too many seemingly unnecessary rules, which add unnecessary complexity. The fact that there are SEVERAL "special" rules to scale for 2 and 3 players exacerbates this problem. The theme is light and playful, but the ruleset is dense and overbearing. Not only is this not a gateway, I wouldn't play this with anyone other than a committed gamer. That alone is unfortunate and limiting. 
3. It's frustrating--In a game of this weight, players should never have to grapple with so much randomness. The pet draws are random, the artifact draws are random, the add-on and cage draws are random, the card draws are VERY random and can be damaging. Also, the customer tile and exhibit tiles are, at least later in the game, unknown and random. This randomness combined with the tightness of the game, create a frustrating experience. On a side note, I believe that the artifact spot is overpowered. 

The game was a huge bust. I didn't even find the bidding part, the part I though I would enjoy most, very interesting at all. The components are okay. I like the minions and some of the tokens, but I wish the cardboard was thicker. The iconography is okay, but takes some time to get used to. The one silver lining in this game is the theme. It integrates well into the mechanics, for sure. Unfortunately, I just didn't find the compelling enough to outweigh the negatives.

I won't refuse this game its charm. The theme and fun is great. I had pretty lot of fun, but ....

This is the kind of game which deepens my impression that modern eurogames are simply the rivalry of designers: who will put more elements, more sophisticated mechanisms, more variables to process. 

The more variables the more difficult is to estimate whether the victory is the effect of brain skills or just lucky conicidence. Especially that random factor of card draw is signifficant here.

The complexity of the game doesn't harmonize with its climate, but ... I like it ;-) Rate could be even higher if the game provided more sophisticated interaction than just blocking resources.

A game full of chaotic fun, imp placement and monster wrangling.  A decent amount of rules overhead means it would be better with repeated play.  Love the theme.

Very charming game.  Played once, and very much enjoyed.  The only concern I have is that in a four player game, one person will go last in the turn order twice where other players only do this once.  

I felt that disadvantaged the one player, but time will tell if that is a valid concern or not.

A really elegant worker placement with... what could this be... Yes, Virginia, there really is a theme. The game play is so elegantly intertwined with the goals of keeping pets happy, alive, winning shows, and finding owners (dificult to do it all with such a small imp family)- LOVE IT. It's also a pretty difficult, brain-burny game but still plays faster than most brain-burny placement games. Very nicely done!

Giving this a 7 rating after two plays, which is kinda disappointing. Might go up or down by 0.5 but probably not more. In the latter case, I will probably trade it away eventually. It just goes to show that we're true Eurogamers, who don't care much for theme. It all sounded blissfully funny and thematic when reading the rules, but once on the table, we just saw a lot of fiddyness and upkeep and meeting the pets' needs with the cards felt more tricky to us than, let's say, the mancala mechanism in Trajan. So ultimately, all the theme just faded away and we felt stressed out. It's clever and beautiful, but the fun was not really there for us. Maybe it'll still grow on us. We'll see.

Sold May'16. Too hard to get to the table.

As with most games from Vlaada, there are many interlocking modules with a ton of rules for each, yet  everything is so logical, that the whole thing clicks during the first play almost effortlessly. I don't say a it's not a damn heavy game; it's complex, but not complicated. Worker placement, figuring out the right configurations for the creatures, while planning forward to maximize the income from exhibitions and buyers - and still, it remains manageable all the time. Top of all this, there's the artwork, to keep faster players happy, while waiting for the others, and the theme actually helps to remember and adapt various rules.

Only played a couple of times, but thus far, I'm really liking this game. I was initially worried that it would feel like Dungeon Lords (which I absolutely love, but I didn't want to pay for another game that scratched the same itch), but it feels completely fresh and just as enjoyable. There's definitely aspects to it that I enjoy even more than Dungeon Lords, in particular the worker-placement bidding, which gives you much more freedom and strategic options than in Dungeon Lords. The puzzle aspect of figuring out how to satisfy the needs of your pets is great and frustrating all at the same time (which makes it even more great). If you can't tell, I like this one a lot, and with more plays, it may surpass Dungeon Lords in greatness.

RATING: 5
The theme and theme-integration were the selling points of this game for me, and it works very well in that regard. However, I care very little for theme, only that it's there (I get bored with games that are completely abstract in terms of components, as far as gameplay I couldn't care at all). My plan for this game was to try out a more complex euro with my wife who's very theme-sensitive and needs it to be able to connect with and bother to play a game at all. It worked as I said, she really bought into the whole pet shop aspect and enjoyed it immensely. As for me, I enjoy it, it's a neat puzzle, the blind-bidding phase where you bid for priority in the action selection phase (worker placement phase) is neat because it's not really "solveable". It's risk vs reward all the way  and it brings with it a lot of chaos when there's more than two players. Then after that it's sort of well... It's a very good and tricky puzzle. All sorts of probability calculation for the cards you are going to draw, and you need to draw up contingency plans and to consider consequences for at least the two following turns. Which competitions will you win, how to maximize your sales, will you have to bother with food or can you take a misery token to grab that artifact instead? Very puzzly, and then you get the cards - or "needs". You see, every animal you have needs something, the older (and more valuable) it is, the more it needs. These are represented by several decks of cards with a known distribution.

So there you sit. Three older animals in your pen, perhaps two workers who stayed home to help mitigate "unfortunate" circumstances, a bit of food - not enough if they all decide to be hungry, an artifact that will maybe help you if they decide try to mutate into gooey blobs. Then you get a fistful of cards and the game says, solve this! So you sit, and all the other players, sit and shuffle their cards, some crying out in frustration as they see it just won't work - something has to give. Others gleefully complete in a second, their pets so well behaved there was no challenge at all. Then when everyone has done their best, you resolve the need piles. This is where you realize that you miscounted, and what you thought would turn out just fine turns into mayhem with Animals fleeing, mutating into goo, dying of misery and disease. No money for you haha!

Ultimately, it's a portion of the game something like Galaxy Truckers resolution phase, it's simply a lot more fun when it goes really really awry. Unfortunately, it's a bit too controllable for it to happen all that often.

So where does this leave the game? Well, it's just kind of solitaire? You all do your things, then you hopefully get to laugh at the others mistakes - but it doesn't happen often enough for me. It's fun to do, but I'd rather have it even more silly (ala Galaxy Trucker), or I'd have a different much more interactive less puzzle-ish instead. So it leaves it a bit in the middle.

A good game, but I find myself reaching for either something more interactive, or something more silly, and for two players - where I bought it to shine, it's just a bit too long playtime compared to Patchwork / Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, and a bit to long to set up. If me and my wife played these slightly longer two player games, this would shine much more.

I was presently surprised, the first time I played, how much I enjoyed this charming game. I was bamboozled at the beginning but after a couple of turns I found the flow of the game reasonably straightforward even if the puzzle aspect of choosing which needs to play was anything but. 

After a few more plays I still remain charmed. It's not as refined and polished as a typical 'eurogame', but that is part of its charm (along with the atypical theme and artwork).

I really enjoy this game. I like the worker placement aspect of it, and how you can mostly determine player order and the items you get to pick if you want them bad enough. The pet raising portion is likewise very entertaining. The monsters you raise behave mostly as you'd expect, but sometimes slightly different. All of this is wrapped in an entertaining theme, solid mechanics, and interesting gameplay.

A good game. A great game. But hard for me to wrap my head around. A lot going on and I suck at bidding games, so I kept getting sniped in the worker placement part, which led to my inevitably awful finish. 

I don't see it as a resource management game all that different from some of the greats I already own and, due to the complexity, I don't see it getting played a lot. For this reason, it gets sold. But still, a solid, solid game.

There is also poop in this game, which is inherently funny.

Can seem daunting at first but after a round or two the theme really carries this one.  I'm a bit worried it will feel the same after extended plays and I haven't felt there are lots of different ways to play the game.  The format is fun but somewhat linear in my opinion.

RATING: 8.9
As usual with [b][person=789][/person][/b] games and specially this being on the [b][thing=45315][/thing][/b] universe, this is simply fantastic.

Every mechanic makes perfect thematic sense, everything is understood when someone is explaining what the actions are, what a player can and can't do, it all makes perfect thematic sense and that helps hugely to the understanding of a complex game.

This is not as complex as Dungeon Lords but it's as hard as it is when it comes to make choices and decisions on what to do and what to do first... it's just amazing... I always feel that agonizing pain of needing to do this, that and that other things and trying to deduce what others will be going for, how much should I "bid" trying to get to the first action first, ect, etc, etc...

When I'm playing I have the feeling that a Spiritual Vlaada is hanging over the game and Evil Laughing at the agony that all players are suffering at the table! Vlaada is a Genius... an Evil one for sure!

In terms of components the game is just top notch, everything is super high quality.

The art is just adorable, the pets are so cute, the board is amazing with so many wonderful little details like the some Imps playing Dungeon Lords in one corner...

A nice departure from the common "goods production" type Euro (not that those are bad, there's just a lot of them). The theme, as many have said, is fantastic and the art is vibrant and nice to look at throughout. Paired with that is interesting and dynamic gameplay. Some might see the theme as childish (the z in dungeon petz probably isn't doing it any favors), but it holds the game together very well.

Many have spoke of it being hard to learn/understand, but I think that only applies if you are making the jump from carcassonne/7 wonders type games. If you're used to games like agricola, puerto rico, etc., then this won't be hard at all. There's a lot going on but players can do fairly well without considering every little detail (e.g. future competitions/sellers or the distribution of cards of each type). While this isn't the perfect gateway game, it could work as one if the "newbie" is prepared for it. Some of the things in the game are a bit hard to explain, but once you're doing the actions everything is pretty easy to understand. That said, there is a lot of depth and room for interesting strategy, if that's your thing.

There is decent player interaction (through bidding for action priority and "contests"), though it's not very adversarial (rahdo likes DP, so that must be true). 

The mechanics in this game feel almost as unique as the theme. Assigning need cards to pets provides a satisfying "puzzle" every round which sometimes feels like juggling chainsaws (in a good way). As your pets grow older they acquire more and more needs, which ramps up the game in a fun way. The bidding for turn order sometimes feels formulaic (as in, everyone bids the same) but as the game goes on this seems to diverge (especially as players gain coins to bid with).  

There is luck, and it can screw you, but for me it does its job as being "deal with the hand you're dealt" luck. Serious gamers who want to plan obsessively and refuse to "roll with the punches" might get frustrated, but I think most will enjoy the variety and tension it adds to the game.

I've only played with 2 players so I can't speak for 3 or 4, but the length seems perfect (full, but not achingly long; around 2 hours) and the dummy system with rotating imps who block action spaces works well. That said, I think I'd like 3 or 4 players where more spots are open.

Dungeon Petz is a fresh mid-weight euro with an out-of-left-field theme and clever, well-designed mechanics.

RATING: 8.5
A fun, crazy simulation of raising pets.  The game is very representational: much of the charm comes from the game's ability to make you feel like you're raising these pets.  You want them to flourish!  For this game to work, you need to connect with these thematic elements.  

Mechanically, the worker placement mechanisms are a bit wonky.  But some tension is supposed to come from a push-your-luck decision of whether to use workers now of save them for animal needs in the following round.  

Dealing with animal needs is the real charming heart of the game.  It just works - even though it plays out as a completely solitaire card placement activity.   

I think the art style is too busy and saturated.  It is beautiful, but hard on the eyes.

An excellently-designed game.  Overall I find it very fun, and the most enjoyable part is the challenge of puzzling out which need cards to play with which pet in each round.

While I was a little too familiar with the inspiration for Dungeon Lords (PC game, Dungeon Keeper) to ever be that attracted to that game, Dungeon Petz is enough of its own creature -- while still maintaining the spirit of the original idea -- to be something really special.

If a game is fun and interesting then I can excuse a rule book that is on par with MJ's Baseball career. Alas, Dungeon Petz seems to be some kind of huge practical joke to mock gamers. Thematically it's cringe worthy, and mechanically it's just tiresome. I will never play this again.

RATING: 8
A gorgeous looking game thanks to David Cochard illustrations. The game rules are long and dense, so do not plan a game without reading them before and play solo a few turns. Otherwise you will spend more than 1 hour reading the rules and loosing the interest of other players (I did that mistake...).
Once playing the rules are much more clearer and logical so the apparent complexity does not translate in complicated game turns, even if there is still a lot to do and to remember.
It's quite typical of Vlaada Chvátil gamedesign, you would have the same feeling with Dungeon Lords.
So if you already know Dungeon Lords and don't like it, you probably won't like Dungeon Petz either. If you enjoy Dungeon Lords you will probably enjoy Dungeon Petz :)

I really like Dungeon Petz, but there are a ton of components and the game can feel very fiddly at times.

After learning the distinction between euros, thematic (ameritrash), and euro-thematic board games I realize that I love games with good theme-mechanic integration (euro-thematic). On the top of the list of these games is Dungeon Petz and since it is also langauage independent I could easily get one in Germany at a reasonable price. 

Haven't played it yet but really looking forward to...

From the same designer of Dungeon Lords, this new game is themed on you running a pet store. You send imps to go shopping, to buy cages, pets and other items for your store. In certain rounds, you have to exhibit your pets and sell your pets. VPs are earned from the exhibitions and selling. 

Every round, you have to manage the needs of your pets, based on card draws. They may have play, poop, magic, disease needs and you have to try to manage all of them. 

It's a fun game, and similar feel to Dungeon Lords in that you are trying to minimize the pain you inflict on your pets. It's a bit more forgiving than Dungeon Lords, where in that game you could lose a bunch of tiles when monsters attack you. Here you would lose a pet, worst case scenario. Dungeon Lords is more fun for me, but this game is good too.

The artwork is excellent. I was so busy enjoying the game that I didn't get to appreciate it all, but it's a bit like a Richard Scarry book - there's so much going on all over the board.
I didn't read the rules myself, but as explained to me, they made so much sense, actually more than I expected from a glance at the rules.
The mechanics were familiar enough to make gameplay (very) smooth, and I especially liked the order of 'shopping' based on the bidding - it allows for a variety of tactics.
It wasn't too heavy, and it didn't induce too much brain hurt or AP - it seemed relatively straightforward to prioritise characteristics based on what was coming up on exhibition or customer tiles.
All in all, I loved it! A 9 for now, but will probably go higher (3-p game).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Interesting worker-placement game. Dungeon Lords is in the same genre, but Dungeon Petz is a totally different take on that genre. Players bid on what order to place their workers by assembling "shopping teams" out of their imps and gold in secret, and then revealing them. The largest teams go first, and then the next largest, and so on, but the size doesn't matter for the action itself.

This, combined with highly limited placement options, makes for interesting strategy. Not only do you have to decide how much you value placing early, you have to figure out how much others value it and try to make your biggest team bigger than theirs, but only by a very small amount.

Contains great humor in the rulebook, but also in the mechanics. Also has fun moral decisions! Do you take great care of the horribly adorable baby monsters you're raising, or do you run a puppy mill and ride their suffering all the way to victory? How much poop do you allow to pile up in your monsters' pens before spending the time and resources to clean it up?

Definitely a fun game.

Original and fun game (especially the rules are really a pleasure to read). Also difficult to play well.

Theme is nice and well implemented.

The reason that it doesn't score higher for me is that there is more tactic than strategy: I prefer games that offer more "freedom" and "creativity" in the strategy realm. In Dungeon Petz there are interesting choices, but more of the calculable sort and more "scripted". The customers card for example determine the way you play in great  amount, there is still some "freedom", but not enough for my taste.

Fun, strategic, cute and humorous.

The detailed artwork on everything is amazing and attractive.  Just by looking at the box and the components, both my girlfriend and my nephew wanted to play it.

It is a Vlaada Chvatil game, so it is a bit complex, but far friendlier than Mage Knight.  Actually, you can just follow the rulebook's description phase after phase and do relatively well.  A couple of turns in and every player has a good idea of how to take care of the pets and how to use their imps.  That's because every action is pretty thematic and makes sense in the imp world.

I was disinterested in this game because I thought it was an expansion to Dungeon Lords, which felt too puzzly for me, but after watching Rahdo's runthrough, I knew I was going to like it a lot.

Try it!

RATING: 8
A worker placement and card game where you are trying to raise cute little deadly pets to sell or to compete in beauty competitions.  The interesting mechanism in this game is if your pet has 3 anger cards, in that pull of anger cards, some of the cards allow you to assign something else to the pet.  For instance, you have a pet that has 3 anger in a cage that can withstand 1 anger, 1 poop, and 1 magic.  You will be hoping that the three anger cards you draw are NOT all anger or else your pet will escape the pen and run away.

During the game there are places to go that will buy new cages, power-ups, first player, beauty contest, selling, and a few other spots I think.

The game is reminiscent of Dungeon lords, but there is PLENTY to distinguish this from the first.  Good game, a tad complicated, but definitely worthy of a spot in my collection.

Hard to get into on a first play as the ruleskeeper -- I wasn't settling into the game as much as referring and re-referring to the rulebook. Probably as a consequence, I wasn't as taken with it as I thought I'd be. There is a ton of AP in optimizing the petz' needs, especially the more petz you have. Curiously, the experience reminded me of Alchemists, although Dungeon Petz felt less bloated.

A rewarding puzzle whose interactive elements ensure that it remains beyond deterministic solution. The adorable artwork and attention to thematic detail are further selling points. Yet the game doles out resources with a begrudging hand, and it bears Vlaada's signature of having just one complication - okay, maybe half a dozen - too many. And so, like a 3-hour Sudoku, the game ends up being too heavy for what it is.

It plays quite different to Dungeon Lords but the pros and cons are nearly the same. Many specific rules, difficult to teach, the game takes longer than advertised, some randomness (more than Dungeon Lords), but it's actually quite fun, offers many decisions and many possible strategies.

After a dozen games, I enjoy it more than Dungeon Lords. The influence of the luck factor is less than it seems, it's quite deep and the replayability is almost infinite because the the monsters/expos/buyers combinations will vary a lot.

I appreciate the usability engineering effort put into this but despise the bloatware manual writing style, and the unsleevable and weird card size. The thin cardboard used for the petz is a bit suspicious as well.

Not many games are about breeding, showing off and selling pets, the less about dwarves doing it. Even more improbable is that these pets are living and rather mercurial creatures that want food and games, get angry, can even mutate and obviously have their own biological needs. Well, here all of the above apply: players are in charge of a growing ensemble of dwarves that must be grouped in several units in each turn so they take care of buying cages and pets and then cater for all of the creatures' needs (represented by different groups of cards). Each pet has got needs of their own, and they can change from one game to another.

As the unlikely hodgepodge of different game mechanics that it is (blind auctions for grouping the dwarves, worker placement for fulfilling all the tasks, hand management for the pets' whims, penalties, a not really trivial scoring system for exhibitions and sales), Dungeon Petz takes several tries to sink in. Once it does, it never fails. The nicely interwoven random elements in the game result in considerable replayability, especially taking into account the amount of material that is used. Actually, the sturdiness of the design is a given for Chvátil, and so is the quirky humour.

I finally got a chance to play this. Not sure what my response to it is. My initial reaction to hearing about it was "must buy", as I love Vlaada and we really enjoy Dungeon Lords. But when I had a chance to buy it, I passed. That's not much of an indication, as I also passed on [thing=70149][/thing] - not because I don't want it, but because I have a lot of unplayed games piling up, and I'd like to play more of those.

Anyway, the blind bidding aspect was a slight turn off. Vlaada's games always turn out a bit fiddly, and this one was no exception, but i think [thing=34887][/thing] does the blind bidding a little better and a little more fun. There is an obvious mechanical difference being that you are choosing turn order rather than actions. But since the value of actions is largely fixed, and everyone needs stuff, you're also bidding on those actions. I think if the actions were more equal, then you'd have some variation, but I didn't really see it. Of course, I only had one go at it. This is an example of making a game out of an slightly different action selection mechanism - worker placement with bidding for turns. The rest of the game could be anything. This just happens to be one mechanic I don't care for as much.

[i]Wow this game is heavier than I expected. (As a point of reference I think Agricola is easier to teach/learn/play.)

- Love the artwork and theme... brilliant.
- The bidding mechanic that determines which workers get placed first.
- Puzzling out how to manage all of your monsters needs.
- A really weighty worker placement game with a great theme (although I still prefer Agricola).

I really enjoyed my play of this and I would gladly play again. However; this is not a game I would ever own because my wife and older daughter would not like how much micro management there is in this game.

BTW: I have seen this game recommended as a family game and I strongly disagree. This game is heavy and unforgiving, do not let the theme fool you.[/i]

Dungeon Petz works mostly because of its theme, which is very well executed. Mechanically it's a bit odd - the concept of assigning a 'sickness' need takes some mind bending at first - but it makes more sense after a few rounds.

Interactive worker placement with a pre-planned / simultaneous / secret splitting of your force into groups of different sizes. Bigger groups get to go earlier but leave you with fewer groups overall. Send your imps forth to do all kinds of things: Buy food, get artifacts, impress the judges, buy new petz, buy new gear for your shop, etc. Grow your petz and show them off, hopefully sell them for points and profit too. Card / hand management is key to keeping your petz happy, since you have only a rough idea of what their needs/issues will be each round - the cards can and will surprise you.

Overall a winner for me. Just so much FUN to play, it makes up for a lot of fiddliness / gameyness in the design.

RATING: 8
Super theme, a mass of components, fun rule book, interesting twists on old mechanics ... there's a lot to like. It's worker placement, but novelly done, in that rather than send one out each time your turn comes around to grab the things you need, you decide ahead of time how you choose to band your imps together in groups. The biggest groups still only get one placement but go first in order. So do you want two things desparately (create 2 big groups) or you're ok with latter picks but you want more things (smaller groups). Good decisions to make, and the normal tension of worker placement is ramped up a little. You're competing for pets and then all the things you need to keep your individual pet alive - food, cages, left over imps to play with it, etc. If you fail, it gets suffering points and then doesn't compete well in the Best Of Show each round, nor might it do well when you're selling it off. So balancing all these things provides an entertaining experience with a nice blend of inter-player competition plus the "sort out your pet by yourself" bit which is reminiscent of its brother game Dungeon Lords.

What I liked:
- The theme carries through pretty well (but see below)
- Nice components

What I didn't like:
- The theme is depressing, as it is basically a cruel puppy mill (or prison)
- The core mechanism (imp placement) requires you to commit resources without enough information to do so
- It feels pointlessly complex to me (which is typical of Vlaada games)
- It is long (3p learning game aborted 2/3 complete after 3.5 hours including an hour of rules/setup)
- The card draws seem to add a *lot* of randomness for a game that feels so deep and thinky

The theme worked better than I had expected. I liked various things about the game, but the blind imp bidding was just really annoying. And it reminded me that I really prefer games of below 3 weight rather than above 3. I would give this about a 3.3.

After reading more, it sounds like the game is intended to be played more as a light chaotic romp, rather than as a deep thinker. The only way I can think of to do that would be to enforce a time limit for grouping your imps--maybe 30 seconds. And then perhaps another 30 seconds for choosing your cards. But I would absolutely hate it that way.

It's so much deeper and heavier than a first glance may indicate while still dripping with that trademark Vlaada zaniness and dark humour. Has a few of the other trappings of a Vlaada design which many don't like (lots of weird corner case rules, a non-standard rulebook) but I love how thematic it feels while you're playing it. And if you ever have a pet die from sorrow... oh man your heart breaks for the poor thing, and it's only cardboard! That's an indication of a great design in my book.

I can tell this is a good game and I enjoy the tough decisions and planning in it, but it doesn't stand out from the crowd. Plus, it is just a tad too difficult and fiddly, making it difficult to bring back out on a whim. A somewhat thorough rules refresh is almost always needed.

So much love, in one small box!!!

I must admit I didn't think much of the artwork when I first saw it, but when I learned what the game was about, I understood that I was clearly wrong!

Vlaada and the rest of his team managed to give life to cardboards. Those petz are alive!

Also the game is so thematic that a pretty complex set of rules, feels straight forward and easy even for non gamers to follow. 

The Vlaada-CGE rulebooks are always trying hard to be funny, but they succed only at beeing pleasant (and that is very good). This one though, made me laugh for the first time. The rule with the happy farm and the meat is hillarious!

Love it!!!!

Thanks again Vlaada.-

(Wife's Point of View: She promised that one day she will let me teach it to her, only because of the theme. If it wasn't for it I wouldn't stand a chance)

Update(07/2013): My rating still stays the same after these years. But the feeling of newness has gone and it the game begins to feel a little bit samey. If this trend continues, I have to lower my rating. Still great great theme and graphic and a joy to see it on my gaming table.

Similar in look and feel to Dungeon Lords, this game is based on buying, raising and then selling off your Petz. They have different needs and you need to ensure they do not go hungry, mutate, have someone to play with and many other things. At its base, it is a worker placement game, but with a great theme and some interaction between players, since places are limited. If you like Dungeon Lords, you will likely like this one and in my opinion, it is the better of the two.

I love the theme. The way the worker placement mechanism is implemented is brilliantly done. The mechanism of drawing cards to assign needs to a creature is really really interesting and gives each creature its own "personality," as you might really need your creature to be extra fierce to show off, but instead the creature just poops in its cage. This game is really looooong, though. Setting up the board in-between rounds is very fiddly, especially if there is a dummy player.

I liked this better than Dungeon Lords, but I'm not a Dungeon Lords fan.  This one felt much better connected: it was easy to understand how what I was doing affected how I would score.  The worker placement aspect felt like Agricola, but it was missing a lot of the tension: it seemed trivially easy to avoid suffering tokens, mutation tokens, and other penalties.  The card assignment bit was clever, but again, lacked tension: never did I leave this phase wishing I had made different choices in placement; there was always a perfect solution in my hands.  I liked the end-turn shows and buyers, but buyers took away my monsters, giving me one fewer thing to manage.  It's a decent game, but it just seems too easy to do whatever I wanted.

Similar to Dungeon Lords, however cuter but still having many decisions.  It's heavier than it appears.  It has an excellent integrated theme.  I like how the turns are limited and seeing the many different pets.  I like the card effects not being set.

My main complaint is how one would acquire extra imps.  Once one got that over others, they'll have a bidding advantage which is hard to overcome.

I've really enjoyed all of Vlaada's games. Mage Knight and Galaxy Trucker are both in my top 10. So I was confident enough in this that I actually bought it without having played it. It a very good game, though not as great as the others I mention. Thematically, each player is controlling a group of imps that have started a pet shop to raise monsters, show them at exhibitions, and sell them to finicky dungeon lords. The action selection mechanism is interesting. Players secretly make 1-6 lots using imps and gold. Then all lots are revealed and players choose actions with each lot from largest to smallest. Action spaces allow players to purchase pets petz, cages, food, upgrades, etc., as well as doing various other things. After the actions are resolved, each player draws needs cards based on the petz he controls. Then the player must assign needs to his petz and meet those needs to avoid bad things happening. Because of the vagaries of the draw when receiving needs cards, it is sometimes impossible to meet all the needs of one's petz. At this point, it becomes a game of puzzle-solving in order to do the least harm. The needs cards also affect the phases in which petz are shown and sold, as the judges of the exhibition and the buyers of the petz have particular likes and dislikes. The needs cards played on a given pet affect how it is rated and how much a buyer will want it.

Like many of Vlaada's games, there is a bit of a steep barrier to entry as there are intricate rules for each phase of the game. However, I found that once we were up and running, the game play was very smooth - even more so than Dungeon Lords. The theme and art of Dungeon Petz go a long way to making this an enjoyable ride. If you enjoy Vlaada's games, I think you'll like this. If you find them to be tedious optimization puzzles, I don't think Dungeon Petz will change your mind.

The mechanics match the theme perfectly, you've got a ferocious pet so you put him in a strong cage. He loses the eating contest, but does well in the arena.

This game is drowning in cardboard. I love games that are deep and strategic but simple and intuitive. This game is cute, thematic and beautiful, and I have no idea whether it is deep and strategic because I couldn't get past the logistical overhead of shuffling handfuls of tiny little pieces from place to place. 

This is the type of game that begs for a radically streamlined 2nd edition - or possibly a card game that retains the theme and concept while eschewing unnecessary mechanical complexity.

Whimsical theme disguises a heavy worker placement Euro: buying, raising and selling monsters. Humorous art and theme. Challenging to teach and learn; tactically demanding (brain burner, AP prone). Lots of fiddly rules and open play.

It's an interesting mismatch between heavy mechanics and light fun atmosphere; it makes it a bit tricky for us since the theme will be alluring to many we play with but the mechanics may deter them.

A convoluted rule set hides a fairly simple worker placement game, with a blind auction placement mechanism.  The theme is interesting and well-executed, the art is a little busy, but fits perfectly.  Like most Vlaada games, it is loaded with iconography, but after the first play, it plays like second nature.  
I'd complain that the set up is a little long, but for such an elaborate game, it isn't terribly off-putting.  
Overall, I like this game.  I think it is starting to show its age a bit...the worker placement genre is absolutely loaded these days...but for what it is, it is a very good example.

We love Dungeon Petz! It's got this adorable theme and a lot going on. I love that the humorous element provides a respite from the typical serious tone that similar games often have. The pet needs and contests can make for some brain burning when you have three or more pets. It's great fun though. Call me juvenile but poop cubes in a game just tickles me.

One of those (rare?) games where just about everything makes sense thematically. The art work is phenomenal, lots of humour. And the game play is actually pretty solid. 
Have not played this one solo (also does not come with solo rules) - have been playing two player games with my partner.

Used the rulebook to teach new players which is very helpful. Excellent game of planning for taking care of, exhibiting and selling petz to dungeon lords. Love the rule where petz that were too old to be sold in the market were sent to a faraway land where they live happily ever after, but somehow extra meat is added to the meat stand when that happens.

Was told that the end game scoring are two separate exhibitions and not what I did by adding all the 2 end game exhibition points directly to Reputation points. Corrected by a kind friend, Imtiaz.

I Expected: A light hearted Euro. Whip style pet training. Deceptive underhanded cheat mechanics to gain undue victory points.

In Reality: A medium heavy fun'o'rama complete with injuries! Not deceptive whatsoever. Strait forward impchanics with plenty of options for scoring and, to my surprise, avoiding negative endgame VP loss. 

COMPONENT QUALITY: HIGH, with some minor annoying sticker application.

RATING: 2
Zooloretto with difficult to manage pets and hard to please customers. So perhaps it is closer to A Little Shop of Horrors. It becomes a difficult exercise of resource management, being blocked by your competitors and avoiding disasters.

Each turn is a puzzle to be solved. From the blind bidding for the turn order to the limited number of actions and resources, to matching your pets needs to the resources you have. This puzzle becomes more difficult as you acquire more pets. Not to mention the longer range problem of having the right kind of pet for the shows and customers. 

It is a gamer's game. Very challenging with a lot of moving parts and considerations. A little too chaotic for its forward planning aspects. Could see a huge issue with AP.

Had to downrate since it single handily almost turned my wife into a non-gamer.

So far, the best worker placement game for me. You'll either love the theme and artwork or hate it, making it a poor game for you. If you like it, though, it's just supercool. German worker placement games are usually insanely dull, with all these buildings/roads built and generic resource gathered (money/stone/whatnot). Here, you have a chaotic and funny environment, meat and vegetables, adorable monsters, hidden betting with actual figurines, and a few minigames hidden inside the game, with the card "needs assignment" being the most cool one. It's one of those rare games where the theme is everything. It makes the game, it makes the gameplay. You will not "play the game", you will send goblins, build cages, care about animals and make a show off during a fair. The immersion is amazing.

Rulebook is quite funny, but written in such a way, that it's hard to follow it and first time, you'll get some troubles understanding at the rules. After that, the game does not drag anymore and it's just a lot of laugh. 

Yes, your petz will poop a lot. Yes, it's a great topic for making silly jokes in-game.

Aug 2015: I visited the CGE table at GENCON. I was asking when they would decide to dump it - it was Sunday. Paul cut me a good deal... I texted Althea "Oops, I went to the vendor area and accidentally bought a game" ;)

Sept 2015: Played with Jason and his family at HTG - loved it. Simple theme complex execution.

This game is charming (which is not something you expect for a game with cubes that represent "poo" and "suffering").  I love the unique feel it has for what could otherwise have been "just another worker placement with a different theme".  I like the variability from game to game, and I enjoy the puzzle of allocating the cards to your various pets in the way that's going to be best for you.  Getting the right cards at the right time can really save or ruin you in this game, but that hasn't bothered me in a negative way yet.  I don't think the fiddliness is a huge problem, but I would LOVE an iPad version of this game.

My biggest mistake was expecting this to be a lot like Dungeon Lords. Petz is a much simpler affair, with much more forgiving challenges. I must say, I love the idea of breeding monsters and showing them off. It reminds me of one of my favorite video games as a child- Legend of Mana.

I made a lot of mistakes on my first play of Dungeon Petz, and found the pet aging mechanic a bit at odds with how few rounds the game lasts, but I could see this becoming a favorite over time.

There are a lot of things happening in this game and it felt just a bit too limiting for me to rate it higher.  What I mean is that while the game does take a bit of time to go through, you don't really have access to much while you are playing.  i.e. Only one player getting access to collect more workers per round.

The art is pleasant and the pets are fun.  There is a great deal of resource management happening here and the worker placement is definitely the driving mechanism, but also seems to fall to the background since that phase of the game goes so quickly and the majority of your time is spent in other phases.

While I would happily play this game again, it's not one that I'm going to be asking to bring to the table.  A bit too much time to setup and play for the fun I get out of it.

Dungeon Petz only shares theme and a little bit the worker placement mechanic with Dungeon lords. But instead of turn-programming, you have rather have a "blind turn order auction" with the number of your actions determined at the same time; really innovative in my view. For a rather heavy game, there is quite some luck in which costumers turn up and what needs of your pets you have to fulfill (the last one can be mitigated to some degree). 

Art work and components are again very good (:thumbsup:  CGE), which makes you really care about your pets. As usual, a very good combination of theme and mechanisms and just a very good game by Vlaada Chvatil.

Have played 1/2 of the base game with my wife & 7-year-old son.  Enjoyed it very much.  Both picked up on the game right away, though we did help our son organize & plan for meeting his pets' needs.  But with the colors & symbols, it's pretty easy to at least provide for your pets.

Optimizing for points was the tough part for my son, but the part my wife relished.

Art & theme go very well together, rules are laid out very well.  Actually the [B]bold rules[/B] are a huge help for refreshing what's important.  I love that idea.

Wife loves planning out needs, showing pets, & selling them.  Son loves getting new pets.  I just love spending time together with this &/or Dungeon Lords.

Downtime wasn't a problem since a lot of the game is simultaneous or what's happening will directly affect your score.

Great game, always willing to play this.

This game has a nice mix of worker allocation, pet store building puzzles, and resource management. There is also a good mix of tactical decisions when placing works while balancing long term pet exhibits and customers.  Surprisingly, these come together really well and make sense with the theme.  The game is pretty tight with only 6 rounds and I wish I was able to develop my pet shop more but that might just be because I'm not very good at the game.  The theme and artwork is wacky but awesome.  A superior game in my opinion to its predecessor Dungeon Lords.

This is the first Eurogame that I decided I really wanted, in about March 2012 - and also the first game by Vlaada Chvatil that I bought (he is one of my absolute favourite designers, along with Stefan Feld). It has everything that one would come to expect from Vlaada - mechanics which provide innovative twists on classic Eurogame mechanics, a brilliant theme which really shines through, a rulebook which is hilarious while remaining a joy to read and explaining the game very well, and gameplay which requires difficult decisions and can even be quite punishing if you are not careful.

This is also one of the few Vlaada games which I can get my game group to play, if not that often. But we haven't played this since at least 2013, and mainly due to my own preferences. This is now easily my least favourite Vlaada game that I own - I think it is much more luck-dependent that say Dungeon Lords, and the blind-bidding mechanic, while both original and fun, doesn't provide hair-raising decisions in the way DL's action-selection mechanic does. I still think this is a good game, but I now never find myself actively wanting to play it.

RATING: 8.2
(+) The theme is wonderful and fits the game experience perfectly!
(+) Unlike many heavily themed games, this is a clever and elegant euro-style game which offers many difficult and interesting choices
(+) There is a luck-element involved with drawing the need cards for your pets. I usually dislike luck-driven elements in a game, but here this really adds to the feel you are taking care of cute and unpredictable baby pets. Moreover, you can influence your chances and have different ways to cope with a bad card draw.
(+) A lot of game for a relatively simple set of rules. The rules are pretty intuitive, which makes it easy to teach the game.
(+) The game relies heavily on making efficient decisions and good planning.
(+) The worker placement part in which you have to assign groups is challenging and very tense, but forgiving. There is always something useful to do and you can assign the workers differently should other players surprise you with the groups they assign to actions on the game board

(-) I like the mechanism by which you draw the need cards for your pets and the fact that you have a limited amount of influence and insight as to what to expect, but still a bad card draw can be quite problematic in your overall strategy. I generally dislike luck-driven elements in games. Luckily I think the system with the need cards is really cute, so I'm a bit more forgiving for this mechanism in this game... There are also multiple ways to cope with a bad card draw.

This is a hardcore worker placement and as such not for everyone. There is also a fair amount of randomness induced by the players as well as card draw, so again, not a game for everyone.

So, while I wouldn't shy away from joining a game, I'm not sure I'd ever want to suggest it. It has 'crush the newbie' written all over it, which is not my idea of fun (unless all players are veterans and are in that type of mood).

It's not a bad game by any means however.

 I am not particularly keen on worker placement games, but this one struck a chord. It possesses fairly whimsical yet poignant theme of raising monster pets, which I am keen on. But more importantly, I enjoy the hidden bid for turn order which prefaces every turn you play. This is what separates it from your everyday worker-placement game. It asks interesting questions with regard to value, and adds some tension to what would be a normally lackluster mechanism. No longer are you consistently relegated to turn order to select your place of action, you have some means to subvert others and advance on their turn. Interestingly enough, each time I play this game, it hums along almost seamlessly (after the initial rules hump), as many of the interlocking rules and exceptions are thematically connected.  

(+) Hidden bid for turn order adds tension. 
(+) Strong thematic connection of rules and exceptions make gameplay intuitive. 
(+) Rewards strategic planning and mitigation. 
 
(-) Element of randomness can give some real sour 'needs' draws.
(-) At high player counts, you may be at a loss of useful placements if you cannot/do not bid competitively. 
(-) May lack longevity, as the re-playability seems to lie in variability rather than underlying depth. The length hurts it from being something that regularly hits the table, so this may not be a big factor.

You wouldn't think that a game this complex and clunky-looking would evoke strong imaginations of the theme, but the masterful Vlaada offers another amazing game experience here.  It may be silly and lighthearted in presentation, but this is a very tense game that can make you feel on the brink of a downward spiral each round, as you struggle to maintain your creatures while also doing enough to impress judges and customers enough to win the game.  Many times each game, you'll breathe a sigh of relief as you get to take the action you *needed* in order to avoid disaster, or panic as you look desperately for an alternative to the action you *thought* you needed that was just taken.  I was careful in specifying that the game merely looks clunky at a glance; this is more than sound mechanically, and presents its theme extremely well.

Solid, middle-to-heavy euro, with a very interesting use of randomness to simulate randomness...

Boils down to a worker-placement/risk-management game with a quirky theme, and an interesting series of decisions. Picks up major points on the theme and artwork.

Two and three player games are a little strained, but they do work - ideal with four, I think.

I found it a lighter dungeon lords in someways, the bidding is trickier I think that the placement of dungeon lords but the pets are simpler than the adventures.  Maybe it really has nothing in common as Greg said, it has been to long since I played dungeon lords.  

I really love the theme and the game seems to have good choices.  I worry the bidding is to unforgiving.  We had 2 people who wanted the get imp action on the last round and the bid went to turn order and the loser didn't have a second action that was nearly as good.  Maybe a few more plays will make it clearer.

Somewhat more accessible then Dungeon Lords and definitely not as punishing. There are still places where something can go horribly wrong, but it's easier to avoid them. However, if you play well and don't take too much risk, you are unlikely to lose the effects of your work or have them destroyed as in Dungeon Lords. I think it gives you more control, with fewer things going wrong by chance, while still giving a feeling of manoeuvring on the verge of a catastrophe. Tight resources, emotions from not knowing if you'll be able to take the action you need, deep and fun theme. I wish there where more games like it.

Can't quite put my finger on it, but I just didn't like it. No that the theme is bad, but it didn't grab me. The mechanics seemed convoluted. Lots of planning required and yet every turn seems to be a disappointment. Played a few times and just didn't find it any fun. I can see that other people would rather enjoy it though. Not a bad game, but just not for me.

You might think this is a light kids game upon first glance, but don't let the name fool you!  This is a worker placement game with some really brain burning elements!

RATING: 8
We first played Dungeon Lords this year, which I ended up liking quite a bit. Then someone was selling a pre-owned copy of Dungeon Petz, so I added it to my shelves. It's another good game.

The designer definitely built this around the main concept of the story it is trying to tell without first focusing on specific game elements. The concept of starting a pet shop and managing live animals for a while and showing them off before selling them. You have to have cages for your animals, and the pets have different needs, such as hunger and playfulness and pooping. Can your cage contain any tantrums they might have? Or will magical outbursts from the pets be too much for the cage to contain?

But some interesting game play elements are strong enough to make this a good game, too. You put your workers in groups, and the largest groups get first choice of the action spots. Also, you have a bit of control over the needs that you assign to the pets which, combined with knowledge about future scoring rounds, allows you to plan ahead about how best to play.

It's a unique game. And the experience is somewhat whimsical. I don't really like some of the upkeep that the game requires. (Did I put out the new cages? Oh, I forgot to refill the food stands.) But it is fun to try to puzzle out which pets should have certain needs and how to manage your worker imps on what to do. And all the poop talk makes us laugh.

This is an interesting take on worker placement. I like the worker groups. It allows you to prioritize between taking many actions that people pass over and taking whichever actions you want at a higher price. It's a good idea, and it's well implemented. The needs cards work well. The main issue with the game is that it's a little complicated to teach people and I wish the buyers were all revealed from the beginning of the game so that I could plan better.

Wow, this game is awesome! But it's definitely a brain burner - Mel said she felt stressed and exhausted after we played it (she had 3 older pets for pretty much the whole game, it was much more relaxing with me and my 2 pets). I'd love to try this again and with a bigger group before giving it a rating, but as of now I'm thinking it deserves 8.5.

Update: got some card holders and Mel likes it a lot better now. I've also tried it with 4 players twice and it's been a hit. Second time with 4 only took 2 hrs, so it doesn't need to take a super long time. Awesome game!

Provisional rating: only played once all the way through (2 player) and solo-ed a few times.

I appreciate how the distinct parts of the game- shopping, pet care, and selling/showing pets- are carefully united through the inter-functioning of the game mechanisms (worker placement gets you better stuff for matching the needs symbols; effectively matched needs yield better scoring, etc) and through the theme of running a pet shop.

Beautiful to look at with wonderful little plastic goblins pieces. Seriously funny rulebook. Cute Petz.

I just wish the rules weren't so involved, so that the barrier for entry would be lower.

Dungeon Petz maybe has a slightly quirky theme, but it is definitely an awesome game.  We have a blast caring for and eventually selling these goofy little pets, but make no mistake - this is still a very challenging game.  We like the secret placement of the workers in the beginning of the game;  It adds an extra element of tension to the game.  Highly recommend this one for anyone with a quirky and good sense of humor.  It is very thematic and makes a lot of sense.  Enjoy!

Loads of rules, but I don't mind because 1) they aren't ambiguous (looking at you M&M), and 2) they are all thematically motivated within the manual itself. Speaking of theme, this is the most thematic game I own; it's really amazing. 

The game is kind of fiddly, but it doesn't bother me. For some reason, my wife's AP doesn't manifest as strongly in this game as it does in others. Component quality is subpar (imo). 

Update: Starting to feel a bit samey with two, since the dummy imps follow a fixed pattern. This isn't a problem on the pet/cage/addon track, since all of these come out randomly. However, availability of the other action spaces follows a very specific pattern every game. This is most noticeable for food, relatives, and the auction space. My play has fallen into a particular rhythm, driven by the availability of these spots. As a result, I can't really recommend this for two anymore.

I guess another thing I don't care for is that it feels more like competitive puzzle solving than playing a game against each other.

I've never before seen certain people from my gaming group suffer like during that one game of Dungeon Petz we played. It's fiddly, the hidden group setup phase makes it really hard to guess how much effort you need to spend on your biggest group to get the action you want, the assigning of needs to pets cries for micro-optimization, it's really hard to predict what you will draw and what you need to prepare for -- do you need to get food because you will draw lots of "hunger" cards, or should you get a cage upgrade to deal with all those "rage" cards? -- and I guess I could go on. It's cute, I grant it that much.

Surprisingly thinky given the theme. This one has everything you come to expect from a Vlaada game. Not as complex as some of his other creations (Through the ages; Mage Knight), but an excellent game nonetheless.

What's particularly enjoyable (and sometimes frustrating!) is the unpredictable nature of the creatures themselves - we've had games where someone's stareplant went beserck and went rampaging across the countryside, or some cute little monster mutated and ultimately blinked out of existence.

You can make contingency plans in Dungeon Petz, but you will never have perfect control of your 'pets' so if that kind of randomness irritates you, it may not be the right game for you.

Finally got around to playing this one some more.  2 2 player games back to back giving a better feel for it. Has me very interested to continue on.  Feels like a very unique WP game.  The bidding aspect to send workers gives that part a nice twise, followed by the puzzle aspect of assigning pet needs to match up how you want taking the Exhibitions/Sales into account which I like.  

Don't mind the way the dummy imps take action spots to balance for 2 player.  Makes it so you have to plan a bit so you don't mess up your next turn.  

Theme/components are great for this brain burning Euro, which is huge plus.

Wife likes it too.

A Dungeon Lords történetét továbbszőtte a szerző és egy új játékot alkotott, amiben impjeink vezető nélkül maradnak és vállalkozásba kezdenek. Szörnytenyésztő szerepébe bújnak. Szörnyeket szerzünk koboldjainkkal a négy lehetséges ketrecünkbe, versenyeztetjük őket, felneveljük, majd minél jobb áron el próbáljuk adni. Gyönyörű kivitel, vicces megoldások. A játék sima munkáslerakós. Nekem az akciósorrend végrehajtása volt új. Attól függően, hogy mennyi emberünket szánjuk sorban az egyes akcióinkra annál korábban jöhetünk. Érdekesek az állatok mindig változó kártyás megoldással megvalósított igényei. Ami nem tetszett, hogy az állatokat megvevő kereskedők csak egy kőrrel korábban derülnek ki az alapjátékban így nagy a szerencsefaktor az egyes állatok eladási árait tekintve. Egy szerencsésen beszerezett állat az egész partit eldöntheti. A fix 5 kör teljesen rendben van. A játékidő elsőre 3 óra volt, de szerintem olyan 2 körülire 4 fővel is lenyomható másodikra. Sajnos a szabálymagyarázat kb. 1 órás volt. Nehéz játék a Dungeon Petz, talán még az elődjénél is nehezebb, nagyon sok kis szabály van. Igazi gémer játék. Nekem a Lords az egyedisége miatt jobban tetszik, de teljesen rendben levő játék. Még nőhet a pontszáma.

My impression is very favourable so far.  Too early to say that it will surpass Dungeon Lords, but it has potential.  It does have a slightly similar feel to DL, so plays for one will probably mean less plays for the other.

Update: After a couple of plays, I'm pretty certain that this will not overtake Dungeon Lords in my ratings.  There's just a bit too much randomness and chaos for my liking.  That said, it is probably more accessible than DL, and is even a bit more thematic.

Overall, i like this game less than Dungeon Lords, which I wasn't expecting.  I find it more fiddly than DL, primarily bec the DL rules seem so tied to theme that they are easy to remember.  This game feels like a bulging mass of things to try to unravel, and there are a bunch of little things that I constantly forget.

I might like it slightly more than DL when limited to 2 player, as we often are.  

It is a very good game, and I really need to try it with 3 or 4 players to give it a fair rating.  DL in 2 player mode wouldn't rank nearly as high, and i've been fortunate to be able to get my co-workers into it.  With all the rules, and no easy tutorial like with DL, it seems like this is a trickier game to teach.

Finally a worker placement engine building game that doesn't feel identical to all of the previous worker placement engine building games.  The theme is a lot of fun, it feels like you are really managing stuff to take care of specific needs, and the variety in the cards really pushes it away from being predictable. I like the way you are bidding for turn order, and the mix and match of the way you can use resources makes for hard decisions.

1 play, 4er

I love the art, but unfortunately not the game. It's a good game that requires a lot of planning, has its share of tension from the simultaneous semi-blind (but in a good way) bidding followed by worker allocation for limited locations/actions. Actually, the game works really well! And the monster tokens (dials which show a lot of information) are very nicely done! I just didn't quite as much fun with it as I'd hoped ... will have to try it again.

--- Summary ---
Players each have:
- a board with space for 4 cages (1 preprinted), each of which may have 1 improvement. Cages, used to hold animals, have traits (strength, magic, play, poo-absorption) with values summing to 3.
- a play mat, with spaces to store:
... food (meat or veggies; tracks show how they spoil in 2/3 turns)
... imps (start with 6)
... artifacts (collected during game; each give different power)
... gold
- 4 cards, 1/color; these show one of several types of icons (food, magic, strength, play, poo, disease) with each color deck having a different distribution of these icons.

The board has several areas, each with one or more worker-spots to place imps (total 14 spots available, some with specific minimum requirements eg 2+ imps or imps AND 1+ coin). These are:
- Buy cage (max 4/player)
- Buy cage improvement (max 1/cage)
- Buy baby monster (each round, seed with 3)
- Buy older monster (start game with 1; at end of each round, any here die and you move any remaining babies up to this area)
- Market platform (when you sell, get 3x price instead of usual 2x)
- Get more imps (start game with 4 imps on the board; each turn, one more becomes available for recruitment)
- Judge exhibit (get +2 modifier when showing animal)
Also, the board shows the requirements for upcoming competitions and customers (specific qualities are in demand each turn, determined by random tiles and revealed 2 turns in advance).

Each turn, collect income (1 or 2, based on turn order). Then simultaneously allocate imps/coins into groups; then reveal. Players allocate groups in descending order of size, ties broken by turn order. Take action immediately when placing imps. Then, draw additional cards based on animal attributes; assign these to each monster, then resolve: need to satisfy all card demands (based on cages, stored food, etc.) or suffer penalties (get tokens modifying monster value; possibly kill monster, etc.). Next, players may exhibit 1+ animals (as determined by exhibit tile; early turns skip this), earning exhibit points; earn VP based on _rank_ of exhibit points. Then, players may sell animals, max 1/player/customer -- earn VP based on demands shown on customer tile, and price based on monster (+ price modifiers on customer tile).

At the end of your turn, any unused imps can be used to earn gold or clean poo out of empty cages.

The game ends after 5 rounds, and then you do a final scoring. Most points wins!

There's a lot to juggle in this game and that makes it not at all for everybody.  It is incredibly deep and complicated for a game with such a cutesy theme, but depth and complication seem to come hand-in-hand with Mr. Chvatil.

First off, the theme is very cute and fun and the artwork on all the boards and cards is gorgeous (although a bit too busy for my tastes).  The quality of the components is passable but the boards could use to be a little thicker, they will wear out after a number of games from constant folding.  And the imp figures are dangerously sharp!

The actual gameplay is original and elegant, something I've also come to expect from Chvatil.  The play order mechanic of divvying up your imps and gold is great and offers a mini-game all its own where you have to weigh the importance of first pick over more picks over leaving imps behind for other actions, etc.  The spaces offer a variety of actions that each are valuable although I miss the variety and variability of other games, there are never new spaces added to the game.

This one is a brain-burner despite the fact that the small number of action spaces doesn't change and neither do your pets needs and all of this information is available well in advance (you always know a turn ahead what you need for an exhibition, 2 turns ahead what you need to sell to customers, and for your entire pet's life what needs you will need to satisfy as it grows).  However, even though all this information is open there is certainly a lot of it and balancing how to satisfy all your pets needs, win exhibitions, and make your customers happy can be quite the mental workout.

I definitely need to play this game with the full four, I wasn't fond of the arbitrary cut off from certain spaces in the 2- and 3-player game.  I got rid of my copy though as it was just collecting dust in the shadow of so many better worker placement games on my shelf.

RATING: N/A
Not as refreshing as Dungeon Lords but much more fun mainly because of the poop! Don't appreciate the theme as I don't like any fantastic theme whatsoever but the game has its moments. 
I don't think it rewards long term strategies as the core business are the petz and the way players can feed their needs and it feels like players play with what they draw mainly and not following a strategy. It occured to me that I may have won the game I played (easily) because I draw 5 poop cards in a turn in which the poop would get me 3 points in the sale! Scored 30 points and left my opponents far behind only because I draw the right cards at the perfect time.
I also had some problems in learning all of the small things that the game has. Too many rulling details and fiddly upkeep that I would pass.

Worker placement games have slowly made it to the top of my favorite mechanics list. If you now pair that with the best theme ever (which I definitely granted bonus points for): running a monster pet store for Dungeonlords; and an adorably cute art style you made a winner. At least for me, right up my street. I really love how it is thematically thought through (eg. your food goes bad if you store it too long, the pets poop into their cages. It is a game with poop cubes!!!).
Yes, the scoring seemed a bit fiddly to me (maybe that was because it was my first time playing) and the downtime when everyone is picking their cards to attend to the petz's needs has a chance to be annoying, but I really enjoyed my time with Dungeon Petz and happily play more of it.

RATING: 10
Super cute and adorable game. The idea of raising pets, selling pets and letting them to go to competition makes everything so interesting. The scoring system increase gradually, unlike some other games increase score like rocket. There are a lot of options in the game, some luck involved at the beginning of the turn when determine who goes first, otherwise depends on type of contest and buyer. 

The design of monsters are super cute, just that I don't understand why a pony eats meat as well as cute bunny. Everything is straightforward, only the first time things can be completed and confusing, because TOO MANY THINGS GOING ON AT ONCE, but eventually will get use to it. 

To those who like pets, you will love this game!

Kind of like a better Vinhos-you buy pets, store them in cages and they become more valuable (or cause more trouble) as they get older and you can exhibit them or sell them.

The game is fantastic to look at, and the humour lightens the Euro levity. 

Much less fiddly than Dungeon Lords, I suspect this will see more plsy

A worker placement game wherein you aren't just putting workers on empty spaces, but rather bidding in secret how many workers to send out on errands with the bigger groups getting first dibs.  I really like this mechanic as it downplays the importance of first player in a worker placement game.

This game is such a brain burner and so deeply rich with theme and humour that I look forward to getting it to the table as often as possible.  The only thing against it is the name, which to me, gives a very juvenile sense to the game that is simply not there, but can serve to turn many people off.

RATING: 7
Lovely and humorous theme. This game really sets the golden standard for how thematic a euro can be. And by "thematic" I don't just mean that it has a theme, I mean that the rules and mechanisms tie into that theme.

It's a complicated game, but the rules are surprisingly easy to learn (relative to how heavy it is), because it really helps that every single rule has a very good thematic explanation.

While there is only indirect player interaction, like in most worker placement games, the level of conflict is actually really quite high, and the game makes it easy to royally screw you opponent over, if you like. In fact, you tend to royally screw your opponent over even if you actively try not to. Most worker placements give you several alternatives. If the good resource spot is taken, use the one that's not as good. Or get more of another resource and trade for the one you need. That kind of thing. In Dungeon Petz, you will very often find yourself in the situation that there is one slot, and one slot only, that will get you what you need, and if you don't get it, bad things will happen. So planning ahead becomes extremely important, even for a worker placement game.

The Dark Alleys expansion does alleviate this a bit though.

5/31/12:  I'm usually not a fan of bidding mechanics, but I liked it in Dungeon Petz.  Maybe because it used worker mechanics as well?  The bidding mechanics were particularly interesting to me (for my first game) as the locations to put the workers were not at all balanced against each other.  And I don't mean that they weren't balanced for the appropriate occasion, but not balanced at all, with the auction block/black market being far and away the most powerful location.  It's a very interesting interaction.

Difficult to rate initially, because the game is quite thematic yet overall rather dry...at least at first blush.  It has a long rulebook to go through at the table, but the actual gameplay is neither intricate nor difficult.  The mechanisms all function smoothly, but oddly seemingly lack heart...which doesnt make sense.  We'll need to play a couple more times to make sure this is a problem with the game itself, or just a symptom of the evening.  In all respects we should really like this game, but so far, it just seems okay.

This game shows that it's hard to balance being thematic and being streamlined. I love how thematic this game is with nice little creatures, funny jokes on the board, but this makes this game really hard to explain. I think they could have taken some actions out, without "damaging" the game. I am also not sure that there are different paths to victory, I think you need to go big on selling creatures every time. But it's so much fun to take care of your pets.

Love the theme and idea behind the game... but it is so poorly executed. The game is the quintessential example of a clunky, wonky, and fiddly game. The rules are all over the place and it is like you're trying to manage 20 systems at once with weird exceptions and so on. Plus, the VP you get from selling pets is so insanely huge compared to everything else (because of the multiplier) that it boils down to only a few key decisions on who gets the best pet fit. Ugh... wanted to like this game too since I usually love Vlaada's designs. Like, I understand the humor in that "you add one meat to the meat supply if a pet is removed from the board," but that is just a needless rule for a joke instead of actual game balance.

Felt a bit short, but at the same time good length, since anything more would just be straight repetition.  Tons of symbology which makes the teach a bit of a struggle.  But the bidding of workers was a really cool mechanism, and there were a lot of really good things in the game.  Aging of Petz was cool, the playing of the cards to fulfill needs was cool.  However, the cards you do pick kind of limit your capabilities, since it does have some significant element of luck.  Being only able to carry over 1 card of each color specifically limits options for planning.  And lastly, the scoring mechanism I feel makes the game artificially close, since you don't get points for having attributes, but rather points that turn into other points,  Overall solid medium weight game that I would play if someone wanted to.

Perhaps slightly too complicated and seemingly a lot more chaotic than Dungeon Lords (which it will always be compared with). I prefer Dungeon Lords and find both the game and the theme more appealing, but this is a good game.

Just not a great one.

Update: This is definitely too chaotic for me to love it. It's essentially blind bidding (which I love) but with you having to make 1-6 bids beforehand whilst not really being able to calculate the value of anything to everyone else. That, combined with the unpredictibility of the buyers and shows annoys me a little, but not enough to really affect my rating, just to prevent me buying it.

Even when you're winning, Dungeon Petz isn't fun.

The game itself is a bigger opponent than any of the actual players at the table, which I usually find frustrating. It's particularly acute here, where the game is designed to beat the tar out of you, and you're expected to laugh about those silly monsters in cages.

Pret-A-Porter is similar, but way more engaging, and it's more about running your business more intelligently, and your products don't attack you.

Under the cute surface lies a surprisingly challenging game. Assigning the different needs to each pet is always a puzzle, the bidding with workers mechanism to race for the best spots is tense and exciting. This is a really good game, but unfortunately it's not for us. We found that this is too complicated to teach and it takes a very-very long time to assign the needs when you have to juggle several pets at the same time.  With two players the inclusion of dummy figures is annoying, with more this games just takes an exceedingly long time. With experienced players you might be able to get it down to 2.5 hours, which makes this game long overstay its welcome.

I want to play it, but my impression is that Dungeon Petz is too fiddly and inelegant to own. The concept is simple, but the rules are ornate and every little trinket demands explanation before you can fairly start to play. Rules beget theme beget rules beget more rules; the primary mechanic seems to be upkeep.

Funnily enough one of the things I'm not all that keen on about this game is the theme, or perhaps the artwork. It's not really my style. I honestly really like standard euro themes such as 'trading in the Mediterranean' and farming, and while I appreciate delineations from that, this just feels a bit tacky. Also, while I quite like the hidden worker placement, I much prefer it in Fresco, where rather than bidding you actually have to choose where you are going.

But apart from that, I quite like Dungeon Petz. Deceivingly complex, and quite unique. I like the worker placement spots, I particularly love assigning the cards to your monsters, and working out how you will try and score them. If you like euros and you want to try something different, I recommend Dungeon Petz.

Though i'm not an absolute huge fan of randomness, I like the idea that there are things that you simply can't plan for. This game takes Worker Placement and turns it into something like raising children (well, you kind of are, in a sense, I suppose..) Somehow, this makes me enjoy the game more, as it's always fun (or frustrating) to watch your pet do exactly what you didn't want (or expect) it to do when it's time to show it off. 

Very Solid, gets much playtime.

Also, C'thulie is just so damn cute..

After one 2-playergame I really liked it, but we got along without a single Illnes cube. I don't think we played wrong, just careful and with 2 players there seem to be enough actions (even with 6 actions blocked by neutral imps).
4 Playergame proved to be much more competetive. We had A LOT of disease Tokens and A LOT of poo.
The only thing we had more was fun.

All in all I like Dungeon Lords a tad better at the moment, but I think Dungeon Petz is much more accessible.

:thumbsup: Flawless theme-mechanisms integration. The game was build around the theme, with painstaking attention to detail, and not a single thing is out of place here.
:thumbsup: How adorable is it to raise baby dungeon pets?!
:thumbsup: Underneath is a solid worker placement euro game with an interesting blind bidding twist, seamlessly integrated with a unique pet store management card game.
:thumbsup: The game offers a moral dilemma: do you focus all your attention on raising 1 or 2 pets and making sure they get the best care possible, or do you go for 3-4 pets and risk overlooking something and neglecting them? The game punishes you for neglecting your pets (you won't get a good review from selling sad pets), but both approaches done skillfully can lead to victory.
:thumbsup: Every game there will be a different combination of customers, competitions, pets, and artifacts, which will encourage you to think on the spot and tailor your strategy accordingly.
:thumbsup: Raising the right pet for the right customer and making sure it looks its best on the day is intellectually engaging and full of tough choices.
:thumbsup: In the tradition of Vlaada's other thematic masterpieces, the rulebook really helps in immersing you into the theme and thematically justifying the game mechanisms.
:thumbsup: All art in the game, including the board and player screens, is phenomenal. It lets the theme shine and enhances the gameplay a lot.
[b][color=green]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:!block: The game is heavy and difficult for its lighthearted appearance. But you could tone it down by only focusing on 1 pet at a time as your strategy, which makes it significantly easier to manage.
[b][color=red]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:thumbsdown: The worker placement phase may create a lot of analysis paralysis. You are required to plan your entire turn ahead, arrange your workers in groups of bet sizes, figure out what spots you need, predict how your opponent is going to arrange their workers, and what spots your opponent needs. All that needs to be done in your head before actually placing any workers. And coupled with the fact that managing the needs of multiple pets can get quite complex on its own, the planning phase can get very difficult.
:thumbsdown: With 2 players the dummy workers do their job in tightening up the board, do not require you to manage them so you can focus on your own game, but we still don't like them. They put the game on rails, to an extent. In every game dummy workers will block the exact same spots at any given round, and this skews the gameplay towards certain powerful actions at certain times, which are the same every game. There's still variability based on the order of the pets, clients, and competitions, but we can't help but think how much more freedom the game will have with 4 players, where every action space is available every round—if you can get there first that is.

RATING: 8
This game really is a hardcore micromanagement game.Well, actually I have to disagree with me here a bit.As with all worker placement games it's very much on the tactical scale as you always have to adapt to the choices left to you and you can never predict as you can't predict your coplayers' actions (at least not for sure unless you're telepathic) Nevertheless this a resource management game, and a very tight one at that. Usually I wouldn't be much into it, but here I just have to! How couldn't I with this kind of phenomenal presentation? Speaking of the rule book here, speaking of the neat worker placement mechanism, speaking (specifically) of the really really incredible A+-artwork  and speaking of course of the theme. Which, despite being a German or Eurostyle game, is given in abundance. This game is a thematical sequel to his very own Dungeon Lords. So when you make a game thematically based on the universe of another game you already invented,what else can it be but dripping with theme? So far this is my favourite 2011 release

RATING: 4
An interesting take on worker placement. A nice mechanic where you have to secretly divide up your resources (imps and coins) and then you get to take actions based on who has the largest groups. A classic "go all in to be guaranteed to get the thing I need, or spread out to get more, possibly inferior, actions" scenario.

That all seems fine. The problem is with the amount of fiddly rules. Oh boy do I hate fiddly, edge-case rules, and this game is full of them. There are also multiple upkeep phases where you refill all of the areas of the board, yet again each one has its own fiddly rules.

Also the game doesn't work well with two players. It institutes multiple dummy workers on the board that add even more fiddliness (the workers move around and block, or even just partially block, different spaces).

I'm still giving this a 4 (as opposed to a lower rating) because the core game seems like it could be really good. It's just that all of the extra complexity and special rules bring it down. I wanted to like it, but it's just way more work than fun.

Sold.

RATING: 8
Dungeon Pets (I refuse to spell it incorrectly, and I'm utterly disappointed that the designers/publishers decided to use the "z") is an interesting affair. On one hand, you have a very cute, cuddly, nice looking game. Children and adults alike fall in love with it and the idea of its theme almost instantly. But...many are deceived. Once opened and discovered, the mechanics combine to be a grueling exercise in disaster management and crowded board space with you opponents. The pets are hard to manage, the customers are tough to please, and the opposing players inevitably get in the way. Children will struggle. It is a challenging game, with plenty of rules to learn. It's a gamer's game entirely. But I feel that the theme is so richly integrated into the mechanics, that it's very manageable to teach and learn. Vlaada Chvatil is one of my most admired designers. This game keeps him admirable.

RATING: 4
Huge disappointment for me. :( I had heard so many good things, and I was really hoping this was the one Vlaada game I'd actually enjoy.

The theme is great - if you ignore the fact that you're essentially abusing animals for profit...wait, don't ignore that, that's terrible!

What I meant to say, is that the theme goes well with the mechanics. And the artwork is AWESOME. But the game is just a big fiddly mess. Too many finicky rules to keep track of. The "needs" phase where everyone is locking in cards is just annoying and painfully slow. And the game is swingy as hell. Also, there are so few action spaces that you can get completely screwed out of doing what you need to do, especially if someone else is flush with gold.

I have come to the conclusion that I just don't like Vlaada's games, and I can't fathom why other people do.

RATING: 2
Way too many mechanics working at once. The rule book is clunky, cluttered and hard to use. It is especially hard to reference in game. The player reference on the screens is effectively unusable because of how cluttered it is. The contents of the box are cheap. There’s no box insert for organization. The tokens are the cheapest on the market. The price point is way too high for the quality of the game. Okay, and that’s all before we get to the content. We bought this adorable pet care game and were completely blind sided by it being all about barely keeping you pets alive until you can offload them at auction. It’s the board game equivalent of running your own puppy mill. Never playing this one again.

Vlaada is second to none at putting a thematic touch into every game he produces and sprinkling in some fresh mechanics to keep the game unique.  At it's core the WP element is very vanilla, but the hand management is interesting stuff and the game play is tight as always.  

Dungeon Lords is a better game but I wouldn't play it unless I had 4 people.  Dungeon Petz is a solid game that can be played with less than 4 and the Petz make it more inviting for people who don't like the fighting.

RATING: 5.5
First Impression:

A highly thematic euro plentiful in humor and great art. Definately a "one of a kind" game. (or in this even more special case "two of a kind").

I don't like fantasy themes but I love theme integration and this game is an example to the whole market in this regard. You even manage poo in this game in a fun way! In addition there are several interesting mechanics, and little manageble luck which overall make for an interesting game beneath the layers of theme.

However, the game is too fiddly for me, and the amount of time wasted in flipping, drawing, replenishing and all the little things combined easily make a 90mins experience drag for 3 hours. That makes the game outstay its welcome. In addition there are tons of minor rules (typical Vlaada I guess) that are occassionally frustrating, although I'm ok with those that add to the theme.

All in all, I have strong feelings about this game, as I both loved it and hated it for different reasons. I'd like to play more, to see which feeling persists, and which fades away.

There are those who think that Vlaada Chvatil is a genius. For the most part, I'm not one of them. I find Mage Knight tedious. I think Galaxy Trucker works more as a puzzle than a game. Space Alert is hilarious, but again I'm not convinced it's a good game. I do enjoy Through the Ages, despite the fact that it's the type of game I usually don't, but that's mostly because I play it online... where the time investment is broken up into asynchronous moves over a week or so. And I didn't really care for Dungeon Lords, the game Dungeon Petz is nominally descended from. 

But I really love Dungeon Petz. I love the theme of raising a monster pet. And everything in the game makes thematic sense. The turn order mechanism is brilliant, you allocate your workers into groups and bigger groups go first, but a group can only do one action. And the way you fill the needs of your pets is pretty sharp too. Each pet has a series of colored needs which will increase as they age. You draw a card of the corresponding color for each color on your pets and allocate them to each of your pets. While cards usually mean you need one type of thing, they occasionally mean something else. So while green needs are usually food, occasionally it might be that your pet needs to play. Then you scramble to figure out how best to allocate your cards to your pets so that you can actually satisfy their needs adequately. Additionally, every turn there will be a competition judging your pets on some random metric and a customer will appear wanting a pet with specific needs. But you'll only know a turn or so beforehand what the competition and customer will be. So not only are you trying to meet all your pets needs, you're trying to assign needs in a way that will win competitions and please customers.

Edit: Downgraded rating slightly because the game is a little bit too dependent on luck.

Lots of cool sub-systems in this Vlaada title. Balancing pets' needs with the exhibitions and customers takes some finesse. Buying the baby pets with needs that match your cages (and getting cages/addons that will fit your current menagerie) is tricky to get down. The specifics of imp grouping and placement are a nice interactive element, in classic Vlaada "guess your opponents' intentions" fashion. There are a lot of little thematic rules everywhere, but to me at least, the player aid does a great job at pinning those down.

This will probably see about as much play as Dungeon Lords. Maybe a little more, since I may be more willing to teach this to new players.

Love the theme and how it intergrates so well into the rules. It's like the ameritrash designs of old, where you imagine a fantasy world and creates rules to describe it, only this one turns out to be an excellent euro. So it's a rare combination. I don't think I've played a euro in which I've lost myself so much into the theme before. And that's a very good thing.

Juego en el que debemos llevar una tienda de mascotas de mazmorra. Me gusta la tensión a la hora de hacer los grupos para realizar las acciones ya que si no haces grupos grandes puedes quedarte sin hacer las mejores acciones pero si haces grupos muy grandes luego sólo podrás hacer unas pocas acciones. La temática es divertida (exhibir y vender las mascotas cuidadas en tu tienda). La única pega que le veo es que jugar jugar tampoco juegas. A la hora de asignar las necesidades a cada una de las mascotas dependes bastante de lo que te salga en las cartas y a veces a pesar de asignarlo todo de la forma más optima, tus mascotas acaban sufriendo. Aún así el juego es bonito y divertido.

I really liked Dungeon Lords, but there are just a bit too much rule details for my taste in that game. Dungeon Lords is a difficult game to get to the table because of this. Dungeon Petz is more straightforward game (you don't have anything like the combat phase in DL), but still filled with plenty of thematic details.

I thought the gameplay was good, but not as good as in the Dungeon Lords. But the streamlined rules are a definitive bonus. I really really like the Art and the athmosphere!

Woah! This game is everything I hoped for and more! First off, it is full of great decisions. Theses decisions may include blocking an opponent, setting yourself up for future rounds, and debating on whether or not to press your luck for big reward - risking the life of your adorable pet for the sake of your stores reputation. Furthermore, the theme is so strong that it's become both me and my 8 year old sisters favorite game! It's strategic enough for gamers and the theme allows for non-gamers to simply have fun as they try to run their own store. My only complaint thus far has been the amount of time it takes to teach the rules. The theme and both humorous and well-written rule book  makes teaching the game easier, however expect to spend 15-30 minutes both setting up and teaching the game before starting. And that shouldn't be until after you've studied the rules and solo-tested the game yourself!

Still a pretty early impression.  I adore the theme and artwork for this game, it's a delight to look at.  It creates stories, which I love.  It's Worker Placement but with a lot of fresh twists through a sort of blind bid for placement and luck mitigation throughout, another thing I love.

The downside though is that it's pretty non-interactive aside from a bit of competition for spots.  It's pretty clear who is going to win most events, though maybe that's a negative towards the 2-player game.

I like it quite a bit, but it hasn't grabbed me as much as I was expecting.  I worry that there's not enough variability or paths to victory to really keep my interest long term.

Very cute/clever monster components.

The worker placement mechanic has lots of degrees of freedom built in. It's initially very difficult to decide how best to group the imps/money. I found the worker placement part of the game to be much less fun than the "meet the needs of your animal part".

I think there's a really cool game buried somewhere in there, but there's just so much going on.

It's also very hard to plan ahead when you can't see what the buyers/shows want more than a turn ahead of time (of course, you could simply show everything at once, but this might be information overload for new players).

Good mechanics and strongly thematic game that would maybe deserve a higher rating than 7,5, if nothing else then for its action selection mechanism alone which is one of the best I've seen. But then again its problems are being unclear in an almost Martin Wallace kind of way but with a busier board and lasting about twice as long as the content lasts. This puts it in the category of games that I like but hardly ever see myself wanting to play.

A sequel to Dungeon Lords, I liked this quite a bit more. I found the action mechanism of grouping imps much easier to handle than the "prediction" skills needed for actions in DL. After the grouping is done, you could look around the table and see what groups were around, making it much easier to decide what you could and could not earn this turn on the board.

The artwork is great as usual. The card play phase was pretty random, the advanced version of the game allows you to play with less randomness, which seems like a good idea.

Budget a ridiculous amount of time to learn the game first time around. Somebody _really_ needs to have read the rules several times before you start if you want your first play to be streamlined. There are a LOT of rules.

Because you're only ever looking 2 turns ahead and your choices are constrained by others' actions, the decision space isn't too brain burny once you're in to it. A nice balance between tactical and short-term strategic- more tactical than Terra Firma, for example.

I enjoyed the manic sense of barely contained chaos, and being forced to make painful and hilarious trade offs. There's luck, but enough information on the table that you can understand and optimise the risks you take.

Sacrifices elegance for theme, which I don't mind because all the rules _do_ make sense, thematically. 

I'd give it a higher rating if I had people to play it with regularly. You need a couple of plays to be comfortable enough to properly enjoy it. As it is, you need 3-4 hours for the first play with new people which makes it hard to get out. 

BBG's rating system needs some way to rate games based on context- if you've got a bunch of experienced gamers who want a bit of a thematic muck about then this is perfect.

The imps from Dungeon Lords are getting their very own show! As it turns out, there are more imps than dungeon tunneling jobs. Rather than live off the system, those unemployed imps have moved to the surface and started their very own pet store. Dungeon Lords have to get those critters that haunt their dungeon somewhere, right?

Dungeon Petz is a vast improvement over its parent game. I love Dungeon Lords and I still think it is a very good game, but it is a very challenging to teach. Having to provide a thirty minute tutorial every time we had a new player absolutely killed everyone's enthusiasm to play it. While there is still quite a bit to learn in Dungeon Petz, it is much easier to just dive into it and cover the rules as they come up.

One of the family's favorite game. The little monsters are "cute" enough to bring both of my little girls fully into the game (10 & 7). We can play this one multiple times in a row without anybody complaining that it gets boring.

[i]Rating after one 4p game:[/i]

Although there are worker placement games out there I enjoy  much more (because at it's core, Dungeon Petz is just a worker placement/hand management game), I gotta say that this is a neat, clever design - the theme and artwork are just lovely and perfectly tied to the mechanics. Theme-wise it's a breath of fresh air among all the "typical" euro games. The major drawback is that drawing the need cards can be too random at times. You can plan your round perfectly only to get all the cards you don't want. 

All in all - it's a pretty enjoyable experience, but nothing more. There's just something about this game that prevents me from liking it more, but I can't put my finger on it.

Pretty good worker placement game. The theme misleads you quite a bit, this game actually wants to watch you suffer horribly because unless you play extremely well, you'll probably end up missing quite a few things you wanted to do. I like both the theme and the difficulty though, so it's perfect for me.

DP is a very well crafted game but unfortunately i didn't like it: probably it doesn't belong to my favourite flavour of games.
It has wonderful components (the eggs are genial), one of the best rendition of a theme, very well crafted and quite original mechanics.

But there is really too much, too many things to take into account, too many bits floating around, too many intricacies and levels of indirection.
DP lacks in elegance and conciseness, it is too baroque.

I am sure there is a large amount of people that can appreciate this game, i am just sorry i am not one of them.

Imp placement managing the maturity of our baby monsters to outperform in contests and fetch the highest price with the dungeon lord buyers.  The charming artwork belies its depth.

UPDATE:  You know a game is a keeper when your teenage daughter is helping you look up the rules and is having fun drawing new monster eggs and reading their descriptions to the group. Side note, both she and my wife get upset if old pets don't get claimed and are sent to the food market. So they are on a rescue mission. :)

A game set in the Dungeon Lord universe from the same designer. In other words, another hit for me. It's different enough from Dungeon Lords that I can own both and not feel like they overlap too much. Plus who doesn't like a board game version of tamagotchi, but then getting to sell the tamagtochi's at the end after cleaning up all their poop.

Een nieuw spel in het Dungeon Lords universum.

De spelers zijn monsterfokkers die allemaal jonge monsters laat opgroeien om mee te laten doen aan tentoonstellingen en uiteindelijk te verkopen aan de dungeon lords als huismonsters.

This and Dungeon Lords. Applies to both. They're both beautifully produced games. They play well, but...
They're not immediately simple or elegant to play. The game also gives me an angst that I used to get with Age of Steam. It's hard to explain except that often I'm not sure I really want to put the amount of energy required to a. reread the rules again to teach the game and b. to play the game well. I love vlaada chvatil games, but I think this is why makes many of his games don't make it to the table often.

Like: Theme and artwork! Worker placement mechanism with the group sizes adds more than it seems. Assigning needs cards to pets and applying them, very fun and stressful process.

Dislike: Many little rules to remember, needs a good reference sheet. Something seems off with the point system at endgame, we have yet to have anyone that wasn't in 1st before the endgame scoring to lose. Can be brain burning to some.

The game is mechanically different from Dungeon Lords, but has the same thematic and artistic feel.  It's perhaps even more strategic than Dungeon Lords, but also somehow more accessible both thematically and mechanically.  Plus it has a greater sense of whimsy.

Decent game, but there's something I can't quite pinpoint that keeps it from being great. I know the player screens have icons to indicate what happens in each phase, but a proper quick reference on the last page of the rule book with actual words would have been much appreciated. Slows down a bit in the end as players try to maximize the last pet sale or two. Better than some worker placement games I've played, but there are at least 3-4 others I'd prefer to play.

Player interaction is derived from the bidding system, which is perhaps a tad complicated and not very clean. Too many variables to optimise. A very involved game. Also a pity that it does not play very well with 2 or 3 players.

Initially complex rules and a bevy of iconography prevented us from learning this properly at a board game cafe. From the impression our dry run gave me this would be an interesting game to play once or twice but I wouldn't want to own it since it'd rarely hit the table due to the steep learning curve for new players.

(Yay for games with a heart of the front cover!)

All the worker placementy angst of Agricola without the comforting engine building to make you feel like you have something under control.  The blind bidding for turn order of worker placing is a fun mechanic and while the need cards are fiddly they aren't as rough to explain as the other puzzle solving bits in Chatvil's other games.  You must play with the card option variant for maximum puzzle solving, planning and fun.

We’ve played Dungeon Lords about 1½ year ago. I really liked the mechanisms the game uses, but the theme…. I was way too dark for me and M. When I heard that in 2011 Dungeon Petz was coming on the market, I wasn’t very interested in it. Just because of the theme of DL. When I saw the first artwork of DP, suddenly I became very interested. It was much ‘lighter’ then DL is, and somehow, it seemed more funny to me. Next thing I noticed about this game, was the pricing. Ouch…

It really has to be a very good game, and there has to be a fantastic quality of game pieces inside the box, to justify the price of €55/$75. Luckily for us, we got the opportunity to rent it at the GGC, so we would be able to try this game before we decide whether or not to buy this one.

Easy said, easy done. Picked the game up last month, and first thing I did, was set up a 2-player game, to get an idea of the game. It was a lot of work to set it up, because the amount of components inside the game box is huge. The, very nice made, imps, known from the game of DL, are also in the box. I read the rules, and believed it wasn’t a very hard game to play. But anyhow, I decided, that I would be handy to have a reference card which shows the turn order in each phase of a round. There was no Dutch one, so I had to produce on for myself. I used the artwork of the rules book to make a nice, at least I think it’s nice, reference card (click on it, to see a bigger version of it).

Finally, today was the day DP was set up again. It took about 25 minutes to set up a 2-player game, then it was time to explain the game to M. As I didn’t re-read the rules, and the first time I’ve read them, I just did it briefly, it took aboy 2 hours, before I explained the game and all of its options to M. It isn’t that hard to do, but there are a lot of possibilities, and little, pretty unique, mechanics in the game. Once explained, we started to play, and the reference card I made, turned out to be really handy. We played it instantly, and it was very clear what we had to do. We only had to grab the rule book once or twice to look up for the meaning of a special token, that showed up during the game. Basically, there are only three area’s on the main board, where you can set your imps to work. That is the market, where you can buy food or special tokens. The, what I call, the Zoo, where you can buy your pets and/or cages and the (also my own name), administration area, where you can send your imps to the hospital, or sell your pets for a higher value, or can give yourself some bonus points at the exhibition. Really, in basic that’s all there is. 3 main area’ and in each area, you can choose about 3 different kind of actions. So that’s makes a total of 9 possible actions. That shouldn’t be difficult to understand.

But, choosing actions is only step 2b in your phase of 6. Each step is divided in smaller steps, so really, there is a lot of possibilities. Most of the steps are really small to do. For example step 5 in a phase is divided in 3 smaller steps. Step a is to sell 1 pet. Step b, is to discard your cards and step c is earn money and/or clean your cages. Step a, might take some time, because you have to look and calculate what is the best pet to sell this round, while step b is taking you about 10 seconds, and step c could be resolved in less then a minute. First time we played this game, it took us about 90 minutes. And I think, when you play this with 2, it could be done is something more than 1 hour.

After playing it’s time for a verdict. Do I like this game? Yes, I do. I like it more then I liked DL. Mainly because of the difference in the theme. Gameplay is very nice. All there is left, is the pretty huge price of the game. Is it justified? When I use the next formula I could easily reach a conclusion: (Components + Gameplay (mechanics) + Fun) x 2 = Price.

Components : 7½
Gameplay: 8
Fun : 7¾
(7½+8+7¾) = 23¼ x 2 = 46½
I’ll be short 8½ on this one, so is the price justified? When using this formula, no it is not. But you can always add a component to the formula. A component called something like ‘need’ or ‘want’. There is always a way to make the price justified. For us? I wait until the price will drop something.

Chvatil never disappoints. This game is very well designed. I've never seen a mechanic like this one before (not to say its not out there). While Dungeon Petz is not as brutal as its cousin Dungeon Lords it still brings a satisfyingly tough puzzle-strategy game to the table. The large majority of my experience with this game is in the two player setting. My wife and I love this game and it really plays well with two players. If you are looking for a game similar to Dungeon Lords that isn't as difficult this is it.

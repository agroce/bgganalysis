One play after having deciphered the rules: Seems like a solid game, with mechanics that fit well together. Our game was a bit long with the winner being obvious for the last couple of rounds, but with equally experienced players, this will probably be a very good game.

It is a pure bidding game, where every player bids to win a the help of a pair of characters, whose help is needed to make offerings to gods. The auctions seem quite interesting, while a little convoluted. The production value is average: artwork and animeeples are great, but the tokens and the small advancement tracks make the game quite fiddly.
Like every auction game, needs more plays to be evaluated thoroughly, because the balance comes with the players knowing the value of the lots they're bidding on in different positions...

This game takes the auction mechanism to the extreme, so there is much interaction and  no randomness, but you will need equally experienced players to really have fun. Great ani-meeples, nice artwork. Gets repetitive towards the end.

It's an OK game, but 90% of the time you are auctioning. After one hour it starts to get boring but the game is good but not great.

On Bruno Faidutti's Best Games List.  Ken got it at Essen 2010 for me.

Wooden animals that really look like the animals they represent!  Beautiful, quality game.

Bidding is different.  Rules are few.  More strategy than expected, and the game took longer than expected.  Almost every one brain burned a little when trying to decide what to auction.  That is understandable since that without the auction there isn't any game left.  You have the auction then you score then the next round begins.

The strategy I want to try next is to go for the Priestess, corrupter, and the Guard--esp 1st placement.  Can obtain other levels by corrupting.

Deep, fun and fast, I can't tell if Offrandes is derivative or original; but I don't really care. It's got cutthroat auctions and very smooth gameplay. The first new auction game in a long time that is really, really good.

Agressive bidding game, but well designed. Corruption and eliminating opponents sacrifices seems to be the only things I do not really like, because it's a direct attack. A game that every fan of biddings systems should try at least once.

When I first listened to the rules I wanted to scream and run away...  BUT during my only play I formed following opinion:

Very very intriguing...
Bidding is very common mechanic, but here the management and timing of auctions is what is really interesting.  Bidding is omnipotent here so if you don't like it, don't you even try the game.  Fair amount of agressivnes is present too.

So why not the higher note?  Mainly because the game is too long (up to 2h) for what it offers.  And possibly it might feel repetitive (constant auctions).

I won't object strongly to playing it again as I feel there is an experience left for me to go through (i.e. competitive play when everybody knows the game already; I've won the first game with gigantic advantage).

It's kind of interesting.  Until researching this game, I wasn't fully aware that there was a backlash against auction games, one of my favorite types of games.  I can see how it is a very commonly used mechanic, but that's because it is so useful (and fun).

I guess I can understand some of the problems - the auctions here are quite repetitive, as each round plays out pretty much the same, and it does drag on for a while.  The game feels like it should probably play in about 1/2 the time - it would definitely be much better slimmed down.

I also really like games with "nastiness", though here the aggression is all very "take that"-y, something that I just don't care for.  In our first game, I pegged myself on the corruption track and all I did was hinder the other players for the rest of the game.  This is frustrating for them, and not particularly enjoyable for me either.  

In fairness, I think it would probably play out differently next time, since we all sort of lost track of what was needed to win.  But the game length and repetitiveness of the actions you take make me think that we may not be able to explore this one too much further.

RATING: 5
Great production, but unfortunately the game seems to be really repetitive and might even last quite long. It's just those auctions over and over again and thanks to that corruptor guy you may get to even stand those auctions for a couple of extra rounds.

It's an auction game. Some say that it's the best Knizia auction game, even if it has been designed by someone else!
Can't confirm this last statement because I only know Modern Art,but I had a great time playing this game: Lots of tension! High interactivity (after all it's an auction game)! Clever mechanics! Feels like the game has high depth also

Fairly standard auction game that feels more like a mix of old elements than a real new game. Not unique or interesting enough to compete against classics like Medici.

Not nearly as confrontational as the comments would lead you to believe.

RATING: 7
Auction game.  Only played it once and it is a little hard t determine which components are worth investing in, but that made it exciting.  I like the fact that the players get to determine which components are up for auction.  This makes you really wonder why are they picking those??  Then you want to bid on things you had no intention of bidding on just because you dont' want them to have it.  Clever idea.  I like it a lot.

04/19/11 Played a three-player game. I found the artwork rather dismal and quite amateurish, with a preponderance of the color bronze that was off-putting. The wooden animals were nice. The auction mechanism was convoluted and repetitive. The game wore out its welcome after 30 minutes, making the last half really drag. You move your markers up, and your opponents move them back down. Now repeat that for over an hour. Blech! I *might* play it once more with five to see if its any better. But right now I don't see how. I think more people would just make the boredom last longer.

I suspect many of the comments concerning the alleged high "take that" element are the result of a misunderstood phase sequence and/or a misreading of the corruption phase. 

Corruption only happens after [i]all[/i] players have had a chance at being auctioneer [so after somewhere around a dozen or more auctions in all have been held for the character tiles].

Additionally, in the corruption phase each player may only be targeted [i]once[/i]; this means, essentially, that only the first player to bribe someone has any real choice who to target.

Corruption is an important part of the game, to be sure, but it's relatively predictable who will be targeted by whom, and it is only a minor part of the things to be considered.

A perfectly good Knizia-esque auction game that I recall very little about since my one play was years ago. But I recall that it was clear, fast-playing (as in, under an hour), and deliciously interactive. The in-game currency is offerings to the Gods, and so the offerings are basically piles upon piles of dead animals, creating an absolute visual slaughter. It's a very enjoyable game, one I'd gladly play again.

A highly mechanical auction game that uses really neat artwork and components to inject some much needed flavor into the game.
I really enjoyed the way points were scored and the end game VP bonuses. There was a nice balance between early planning and turn-to-turn tactics. 
Overall: I'm already a fan of auction games, so perhaps I'm a little biased. I thought it was a very fun game, but if I'm being totally fair I'd say the game could seem a bit too cut-and-dry at times.

這遊戲非常罕見，美工相當不錯，有種華麗的歷史感。
在玩之前，僅僅從美工上，我也不能準確判斷出這遊戲究竟是否好玩。
玩過之後，我覺得這遊戲相當不錯，用菜品來形容的話，算是一碗滋味鮮美的味噌湯, 有味道卻不張揚。
這遊戲有好幾種資源，每種之間有千絲萬縷的牽扯關係，剪不斷，理還亂。。。
看清楚對你最有利的放手去拿吧，只有這樣勝利才會向你招手。

An auction only game that seems to have some flaws or at least some rules that I'm not very fond of, to say the least.
It's boring as players are doing the same over and over. The auction mechanism, which is not original, it's kind of odd and it gave me a strange chaotic feeling. I wouldn't recommend this game to non-gamers and also don't recommend it to players that don't like auction games, of course.
On the bright side, components and art work are absolutely gorgeous.

This game is about one thing and it's auction, but it does it rather well.
You've got some nice options when it's your turn to offer characters for bidding.  The corruption and sacrifice phase round up the game nicely.

Played once.  There's some game space that needs exploring.  There is no luck.  Each betting round the auctioneer gets to choose 2 of 7 roles to auction together. If he fails to win the auction, he may select 2 of the remaining 5 to auction.  If he fails to be the highest bidder again, he can select 2 of the remaining 3. If he fails to win again he passes his turn as auctioneer.  If he wins any of the auctions the 7 role cards are passed to the next player who becomes the auctioneer.  Play continues until all have had a chance to be the auctioneer.

When you win an auction you advance your marker on one of the 7 tracks.  One offers bonus points.  One is the corrupter and one is the corrupter defense.  The other four are all required to make an offering.

Next the people on the corrupter track can steal from the people that have a lower defense than their corrupter level (This can mean that A can steal from B and then B can steal from A depending on A's and B's respective offense and defensive levels). Stealing means reducing someone's level and increasing your level on the same track.

Next in turn order you may make an offering to one of the gods (and score points)...

It is 430 B.C, the era of the Peloponnes war. Hit by famine and plague, the different cities of Greece tries to gain the favor of the Gods and Goddesses of Olympus by offering them the most attractive sumptuous ritual sacrifice.

The game consists of three phases.
Firstly : the bidding phase. Players would have to recruit different offerings/materials necessary for the ritual of sacrifice through bidding. Players will need to out-bid each other to obtain the materials/offerings.

Secondly : the corruption phase. The corruption phase is another way of obtaining the most important offerings/materials needed for your ritual by stealing them from your opponents.

Last but not least : the ritual sacrifice. This is your time to gain the favor of the Gods and Goddesses of Olympus. During the ritual sacrifice, you honor the Olympus Gods by offering them the most sumptuous sacrifice and gain devotion points from them. But beware, towards the end of the game, as the number of altars available in the temple becomes less… players will need to out-wit their opponents to gain the favors of the Gods by offering the most sumptuous ritual sacrifice they can possibly offer before all of the altar runs out. And only one will gain the favor of the Gods.

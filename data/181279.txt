A real co-op style deduction battle. Fun cards that can turn everything upside-down in a minute. Player downtime feels minimal due to the collaborative nature. Always a good time.

Good game and good theme, but in my opinion Dracula's on disadvantage. It's easy to find him, and that's not bad, but also it's easy to kill him in one or two combats.

1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Cat & mouse with a little meat on it. Great theme and presentation. Beautiful map. I like the card and encounter trail, it beats hidden pencil and paper games due to its elegance.
DISLIKE: Long play time. Lots of rules to remember (The rule books are ok). The game can be swingy: early Dracula detection is harder for Dracula, late Dracula detection is better for Dracula. Downtime for Dracula is a problem, especially in longer games.

OVERALL: Our first game, they found Dracula on the 2nd turn. Too easy.

It's a highly thematic experience, but because it is long and rules heavy, it won't make it to the table that often. Still, a good game and has a place in my collection.

I was really excited to get to play Fury of Dracula after my last hide and seek boardgame experience with the excellent Letters from Whitechapel. Sadly I was totally disappointed and so was everyone else in the group.

The steps you take on the board are very small compared to the real life effort you put in them. This makes the gameplay feel extremely slow. The downtime is not that bad but when you see your character barely crawl halfway across the map during a game you just do not get to feel the heat of the chase. Yeah, there are trains to speed up the movement, but you have to spend an action to get a ticket and still the ticket might not take you anywhere but the next city where you could have walked as well. There is a great risk that you do not get to contribute to the outcome in any way except that serving as a potential road block on Dracula's way. So, you can guess I was one of the hunters.

It might well be the FFG syndrome that the Fury of Dracule suffers from. At Fantasy Flight Games they tend to add so much fluff and all kinds of extra little mechanics into to every game. This may make the theme more present but at the same time they break down the action into so many little fragments that in a fast paced action filled horror game you can spend 60 minutes just to move your character from the one room to another and find a chest, the opening of which takes yet another 60 minutes.

I reckon the game is more fun for the Dracula player but I do not see any point playing a game just to entertain a single person at the table while the rest are yawning with boredom. The game is not broken AFAIK but I'd keep away from it. Letters from Whitechapel or even the legendary Scotland Yard gives you the same experience at a faster pace in a reasonable time frame.

Fun, lengthy game of Eldritch Horror meets Specter Ops. Awesome action, intense moments, and nice build ups. Dracula is quite hard to play, especially for those new to the game, but it's better than controlling a lot of characters as a newbie.

An excellent update to the 2cd edition.  The 2cd edition was more about running Dracula down but finishing him was relatively easy.   In this version Dracula and the other vampires can be very dangerous and the balance has shifted to be more of a group hunt.   You don't want to face vampires alone at night.  

Cons:   Game can run long.   It's a game where you want to avoid analysis paralysis and keep the turns snappy.  That goes a long way to enhancing everyone's fun.

Esta edición introduce algunos cambios en el juego, pero creo que no aporta nada nuevo al título, ni para bien ni para mal.
Mantiene la tensión de la edición anterior, sobre todo para el jugador que controla a Drácula.
Es un juego en el que pueden ocurrir turnos muy interesantes, y otros tantos en los que no ocurre nada, en el que los cazadores se mueven y equipan turno tras turno...
Es un juego que fue mi favorito en su día pero que el tiempo puso en su sitio. 
Sin embargo con el grupo adecuado y en el momento adecuado es una pasada, original y muy inmersivo.

I'm giving it a 2 only because Talisman exists.  It's like hidden movement with no strategy.  Did Dracula play well?  Random cards will tell you where he is.  Did the hunters corner Dracula?  No matter, random cards will make him escape.  Eventually someone will get lucky.  Theres no tension.  The third or fourth time the hunters find Dracula (the climax of most hidden movement games) you'll just roll your eyes, knowing that some cards will get played and some meaningless damage handed out.  

This game is meant to give the illusion of strategic play, but there's so many comeback mechanisms on both sides that nothing at all matters.

  A very pleasing game of cat and mouse where the cats are never sure where the mouse is... And the mouse is a super powerful vampire. Mechanics as the hunters work very much like that of Eldritch Horror, you have two actions and can move, rest, supply for weapons or search to uncover any available encounters, all the while trying to cover ground to uncover the trail of Dracula, when you find his trail, the hunters converge to try and defeat him in battle.

  Dracula has excellent moving mechanics that create a hidden trail for the hunters to try and find, leaving traps and hinderances along the way, his purpose being to remain hidden from his foes so that he can raise young vampires to maturity and spread his dark influence over Europe. This is done by picking an adjacent location each turn and laying the location card face down next to his previous locations, this creates a trail up to 6 cities long that the hunters must find to get onto the scent.

  The use of day and night are employed well, limiting the hunters actions in the night and making supply actions risky, while leaving the days free of worry or hinderance.

  My only reservation is the lack of depth of the combat mechanics, combat works in a way that the enfeebled Mina Harker is every bit as capable in a fight as the mighty hunter Van Helsing, which seems a bit weird to me.
  Overall a very involving game that tells a great story of a hunt for a very nefarious foe! I heartily recommend.

Combat is fun, the mystery of finding dracula's trail and dealing with his traps is interesting. The play time is way too long. The amount of individual decision making done by each character/dracula is minimal. I wouldn't want to play with more than 3 players - letters from Whitehall would suit this better (it feels far more streamlined).
The game''s rule books are terrible, there are too many fiddly rules for an otherwise streamlined game.

An epic game of hidden movement. It looks gorgeous. It is VERY long however and can wear out its welcome in the second act if Dracula is caught and then able to make a clean escape. Long to teach and very fiddly but the game at the center is still great.

I love Fury of Dracula, I really do. It's easily in my top ten. The theme is so thick you can almost touch it, especially when you add in some ambient music. The art also really lends to this experience. 

The thing is, somehow the game just feels... Over-designed. Many of the tokens and their associated abilities fit in well both mechanically and thematically, but feel unnecessary. This gives the game an extra layer of complexity that makes the game a chore to teach and learn. As a result, it's definitely off-limits for novice gamers.

I highly recommend a variation of play for this game, in which Dracula starts with a full trail, including event cards. This sort of steps up the urgency for all players as:
A. The trail is easier to find.
B. Dracula starts with event cards in play. 
How it works:
Dracula starts with a hand of SIX event cards. Dracula must use all six cards in the starting trail, before drawing a normal hand of five cards.

Awesome game! Like the theme and combat is quick and easy. Plays best with five players. The game can drag a bit while the hunters are searching for Dracula. PROS: theme, hidden movement with combat, asymmetric gameplay. CONS: can drag for Hunters if Dracula avoids combat, challenge to get to table due to long gameplay length.

Thanks to the 3rd edition, I now own a copy of this. Smooth hidden movement and all-against-one mechanics here, with a classy graphical upgrade that feels appropriately thematic to this Gothic horror rendition of Europe. Fairly intuitive rules, but the experience is robust. There are always going to be some players who don't fancy this sort of game, but I think would be my go-to choice over other titles like Spectre Ops or Scotland Yard.

Initial Impression: Typical of Fanatasy Flight, the production values are wonderful. Appropriate use of icons, card art, and a clear game board all help to make this game a pleasure to play. Gameplay seems like it's more interesting for the Hunters rather than Dracula, with long periods of waiting before Dracula can do something. The fact that this is a cat & mouse game where the mouse has fangs instantly makes this one of my favorite games in the genre. The asymmetrical play ties the theme very well with the mechanisms, as each Hunter even has their own special abilities. Although the game took a while to play, it never felt long. I hope to get this back to the table soon.

It's prettier, but they broke some elements of 2nd edition.

There is no longer several turns of hunting, followed by several turns running for either side. Also, some of the item cards make the hunters very strong, so there is an increased incentive for Dracula to attack them early.

I won both games I played with Dracula and had less fun than has I lost playing 2nd edition.

I really liked the game after the first two plays or so, but it seems that what we called [i]Pirate Dracula Strategy[/i] is waaay too powerful and unfortunately you can't really refrain from using it (the people are about to catch you and you can either get caught or flee to sea. Then with a clever use of cards you can basically heal and reset the chase). 

If this aspect was slightly different then this game could've been a 9 or a 10, with this problem though it's a mediocre game and we've never regretted selling it.

Much more fun than I thought it would be! I was Dracula with 2 other players as the Hunters. Trying to hide from the other players was a blast. I was able to pull off a few close escapes as the net was really closing in! I also enjoy the Event card mechanism (pull from the bottom at night, if Dracula card, he gets it). This adds a nice push your luck aspect to the game. Play with the "advanced" rules (Lairs, Dracula special cards) on the first game, they won't give any additional complexities. My only negative would be the lack of a screen for Dracula. Going through the Location cards has to be done without the players seeing it.

Deep, long, engaging hidden movement game dripping with theme. First play nudged up on five hours and I enjoyed every second. Not something I an usually say as I often despise sitting more than two hours for a game. Dracula has so many opportunities to be deeply clever through taking risks with his path, laying the right trap, and many other things. Meanwhile, hunters have the same advantages. Well balanced, and the game has a wonderful narrative with rising tension and action. If you think the game sounds cool, but are afraid of the runtime, I'd say definitely try it out. Awesome stuff.

RATING: 7
Fury of Dracula is a gorgeous and thematic game of hidden movement and deduction, in which a team of four vampire hunters must find and kill the legendary Count as he skulks around Europe leaving a trail of horror in his wake. One player plays Drac and the rest hunters, so it's four versus one, and there are several very neat mechanics at work: how Dracula leaves a trail of locations and ambushes for the hunters to stumble across; how hunters looking for supplies at night have a chance of actually strengthening their enemy; and how the hunters can't share information without also sharing it with the bad guy. It's a big game (needs a big table), some rules are slightly fiddly and unclear, and it also runs a little too long (3 hours or more in our experience), and while it is capable of producing truly epic sessions, we've found that it can also end in a bit of an anticlimax (a bit like Battlestar Galactica, another FFG game). These are not deal-breakers though, and when Fury of Dracula really hits the right note, it can be amazing.

Advanced Rules except for Rumors.

Dracula must go to land after every sea card played (i.e. 2 consecutive sea cards cannot be played, and every sea move costs Dracula 2 Health since he is always disembarking.)  Black Sea and Ionian Sea are one location (leave Black Sea card out as a reminder.)  Additionally, Bordeaux borders the North and South Atlantic (as is indicated vaguely on the map.)

Every time a Despair token is added to the board, the hunters get a Rumor token.  The hunters may discard a Rumor token at any time to search for and play a Newspaper Reports, Local Rumors, or Sense of Urgency from the deck (then shuffle the deck) or discard pile.

Hunters can heal 2 Health per action in cities with hospitals.

Dracula can use Dark Call to instead draw 5 additional combat cards at the start of his next combat (he therefore would never draw cards that combat since every combat ends after the 6th round.)

If Dracula initiates combat (normally at dawn) with Form of Wolf, his Claws and Fangs combat cards do +1 damage.

Dracula may use Feed to instead search the encounter deck (shuffle afterwards) or discard pile for a vampire and play this vampire card face-up on his current location (the card prior to Feed).  Once this location reaches the third space, reveal that location (as with Newspaper Reports.)

Fury of Dracula, instead of reading "advance the influence track by 3" now reads "Dracula may reveal that location card to deal 3 damage to a hunter in his region.  Hunters can no longer rest."

Finally, Dracula has 30 Health.

An interesting game of cat and mouse. I like the asymmetry quite a bit, although I feel like there are many situations where both sides have limited options that are interesting. Often the investigators will just move during the day and get tickets at night. Often Dracula just moves around and sets traps. The game is very heavy on the whole moving thing. Combat is an interesting deduction game, guessing what your opponent will do to best counter. I will say combat is almost overly simple though and again often leaves players with a lack of options.

This game unfortunately features one of the worst rulebooks I have ever encountered, and the different ways Dracula locations can be cleared are never adequately explained. You would think the most important concept in the game would be crystal clear, however it is not. Luckily the BGG forums contain most of the answers.

Despite seemingly limited options all around, the game is still an enjoyable experience that I would rarely turn down. Although, due to the flaws it doesn't get suggested often.

I finally got to play this and was not disappointed. It's a shame that it will move away from the FF catalog just when I think they produced such a fine version of this title. The hunters have to rely upon a mix of cat and mouse as well as calculating when and how to best make use of their game changing event cards. This makes the game not too mathy and not too card based, either. Dracula's tricks are many -- the special powers at the end of the rulebook should only be added in carefully, I think, as they can be game wrecking for hunters without experience. I was surprised at how thematic and immersive the game was (recommend the soundtracks to Bram Stoker's Dracula and Penny Dreadful during play). As a hunter I wanted to find and punish Dracula for being the hateful abomination he was and the Dracula player tasted our frustrations as sweet, sweet candy. I can imagine this game running long for a title with so many frustrations; it's important for the hunters to get into a good rhythm of snappy turns early on. This is a classic for a reason. I have to wonder with a good degree of pessimism what if anything GW will do with the game now that it is returning to their hands. Get the FF version while you can!

Have all 3 versions, this is the best :)

Combat more streamlined, you only fight vampires (everything else is abstracted), day/night turn progression makes sense. Event draw is more controlled (although events do differ quite significantly in usefulness/power). It feels more like a hunt now - you have to track down vampires and kill them before they mature.

Playtime is now down to more reasonable (2nd was way too long), there isn't really any aspect that I'd want to see changed (unlike the previous two versions).

Furthermore I now think it makes sense as a multiplayer game, there's too much information for 1 player to reasonably juggle running 4 characters. Hopefully this means my usual group will agree and want to play (previous versions were relegated to 2 player only).

Love it best at 3p.  It's really not that complex in spite of all the components.  And it can definitely move quickly with experienced players.  Theme and art design are stunning.  Where Spector Ops and Whitechapel are lighter streamlined fare leaning toward simplistic after several plays, Fury is a much more rich med. heavy experience full of fun and exciting moments.  Needs the right-minded players.  Typical euro-gamers don't have the patience for the less exciting aspects of the early game.  Might be ok trading it because my buddy just got a copy for xmas and he's the one I'd be playing it with every time.

EDIT: Second game was great!... just very looooong. Still want to see it hit another couple more times to see if my opinion changes, but it's just as thematic, tense and satisfying as I had hoped.

EDIT#2: This games is VERRRRY long. Rating dropped a bit. Both my long games have been 3.5 hours on the nose, which feels like it's just 35 minutes to long for what this is, and unfortunately it doesn't feel like it's going to get any faster over time.

I like this a bit better than Letters from Whitechapel (but they are distinct enough to own both).

This has a very interesting combination of mechanics.

Comparing this to Whitechapel I have to say that FoD

-has a slower pace. You do more in a turn than simply move and search. LfW feels like a rush through some narrow victorian streets while FoD lets you think and plot more.

-is more intense. In LfW the fugitive feels totally stressed while the policemen run after him. In FoD even the hunters are stressed because even if they find Dracula, well, then they have to fight him.

-offers more to choose from. It has so much that can happen that keeps the game interesting...but also lengthens it.

Artwork and components are superb, as always. The only negative are the thin and flimsy player "boards"...as always...

All in all I like this a little bit more than Letters from Whitechapel. Not of it being the better game but of FoD being a different game. A game that tells a story.

Couple additional comments: I hear occasional reports of super-long games of this (4+ hrs), and if you're seeing that kind of playtime, you're doing it wrong. Both sides have too keep their eyes on how to win. Dracula can't win by endlessly evading; he's going to have to fight at some point. While doing your best to dodge and weave most of the time, remember: your job isn't to evade the hunters. Evading the hunters isn't super-hard. Your job is to mature vampire and kill hunters, and do it fast.  If you don't grasp this, and figure out what your route to victory is at any given point, you can make the game take forever to nobody's benefit.

Likewise, for the hunters you need to kill Dracula. Not clean up his minions, although you may need to do that at some point, but Dracula himself. This means fighting, which means taking risks. You need to gear up, and you need events. Some groups are paranoid about giving Dracula cards so they rarely draw from the event deck. There is a time and place to be conservative, but in the development phase of the game, don't be so scared of giving Dracula nasty cards that you avoid the majority of the deck that is good for you.

One of the the things that I like about the new game is that Dracula is no longer totally declawed during the day, so for the hunters to win you need to fight and take risks and not just run Dracula to the ground and stake him during the day. There is much more action now, which is all to the good. The hunters really need to be worry about their equipment and not just grab whatever is handy then just make sure they fight during the day. Also, the rising stakes are quite helpful. Now, and early kill is only worth 2 points out of a needed 13, so the old strategy of just waxing Mina early and then hiding isn't going to cut it. The endgame showdowns become progressively more dangerous (because Dracula has to stick around longer) but with better payoffs.

Like all things FFG and GW, there is still enough to quibble with here if so inclined (especially the godforsaken rule book). But a lot to like also, and it does what it sends out to do quite well.
---
Like the 2nd edition, Fury actually plays better with 3 or 4 players than the full complement of 5, IMO; I don't know if there is really enough here to fully engage 4 hunters, and more players can lead to some indecision and a longer game, But with new players, the extra set of eyes can help.

Really like the new edition - plays faster and cleaner but retains all the tension. The latest printing has cleaned up the most disastrous parts of the rules, although they are still really, really bad.
---
Played once. Appears to actually be a substantial improvement over the 2nd edition, and I enjoyed the 2nd edition quite a bit. The new combat rules are a much better, the new day/night cycle is a bit more interesting I think, and the fact that Dracula is not so disastrously handicapped during the day is better I think (in the novel, Dracula does go out during the day and still is reasonably capable). Also the elimination of minions and adding combat with "new vampires" who fight basically just like Dracula is much better. In general, the encounters seem better, better-balanced, and more faithful to the novel. They also work better as cards with text instead of chits.

So in general, I'm impressed with the design of the new edition. I think. Because holy crap, these rules are a total fucking disaster. The explanation is at times almost incomprehensible, and fundamental, crucial rules are addressed only deep in the rules reference, if at all. How to enforce hand limits, for example, is never addressed in the core rules, and never addressed at all for items. Rules on what to do after combat with vampire encounters are contradictory (maybe if you ambush you're supposed to discard them?; maybe they have to be face-down to mature?; or maybe they stay out until defeated or matured?; the rules and card text say all three at one point or another). The trade phase is all over the place - the rules say you can trade items or tickets; the references say you can trade only items; the sequence of play summery says you can trade only events. Van Helsing's ability is incredibly confusing. Good grief, it's a total clusterfuck for a game that is actually pretty straightforward and now in its third edition! Now, in practice, the design intent is usually clear enough, and you'll probably do the right thing intuitively. But FFG's rules are so routinely so catastrophically bad, it's totally mind-blowing to me. Is there really no feedback from the customer base saying to fix their rules process?

Dracula secretly moves around Europe to kill the travelers while the travelers try to get stronger and reveal Dracula before it's too late.

The game is themed very well and is quite fun, but I'm not sure if we've played it 100% right or not.  First play Dracula easily overpowered the others.  Second play Dracula was revealed on first round and easily lost from there. Eh, we'll try again sometime.

Interesting hidden movement game with an awesome Dracula theme. Having day and night turns is a nice thematic touch that separates the game from others in that genre.

It combines the charme of classic scotland yard with cool new mechanisms. Using items, special abilities, traps, fighting. 
The Day/Night rythm is really cool and it effects the actions and the players' advantages. 

Sometimes the fighting thing is too much like paper-stone-scissor in my opinion, very random, or you know ur opponent very well... of cause there are items that give you another advantage. But dracula can react to them... So you're forced to do something, the opponent cannot foresee, so it's random again....

This felt like a combination of Pandemic (coop, hand management, map movement) and Spector Ops (hidden movement, special powers), even though those games came out years after the original FoD. It felt a bit helpless for our heroes. We were powerless against Dracula's minions and crushed by our first encounters with the evil Count. However, we stayed on his tail, eventually all assaulting him at all once and saving Victorian Europe until the next time. I love how much stuff there was in the game (weapons, counters, traps, events, powers, etc.) I'm looking forward to playing again.

The rulebook is bad for an FFG game.  Too many errors but still playable.  Luckily it appears that the components themselves are all correct.  

As far as the new edition, they streamlined it and made it more clear on the distinct night and day phases.  I think I prefer the art direction of the 2nd edition though the components of 3rd edition are better designed and more practical - for example all the effects of encounters on the cards themselves.

Overall an improvement breathing new life into the game.

It's the board game equivalent of dropping depth charges in hopes of hitting on a submarine, crossed with a tense game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Four hunters work together to hunt down Dracula. The hunters can coordinate, which does tend to lead to Alpha Gamers bullying others around the board. Dracula, meanwhile, is hidden from view. It's up to the hunters to hit upon Dracula's path by visiting a city he's been in recently. Once one of the hunters locks on to the bloodsucker, the rest come running. As for Dracula: evade, evade, evade! Time is your friend, so keep running down that clock. The well-balanced system leads to some very tense games.

Probably more of a 7 due to length. Looks great, thematically great, nice rules, good rule books. Watch a video on how to play, note it will be a long video but it's worth it. Be aware though the negatives people say about the game are true. It's long, can be bothersome for some due to Drac's powers, some players can get lost in the shuffle, Dracula using the sea to his advantage and 5 players is important. People who love gothic horror, Dracula, and hidden movement games will love it, I think the point of this game is to just enjoy playing and not be too competitive. Turn down the lights, put on the Dracula soundtrack, and get into character.
Note: It says Fury of Dracula but Dracula is not too furious. He is running most of the game occasionally trying to pick off a stray Hunter since teaming up is against Dracula is the key strategy.

Desire for this has wane, I avoid Mayfair and Asmodee games.
Mayfair with its price floor keeping prices artificially high, Asmodee business model, of cherry picking a few high volume online sites, forcing them to sell at  higher prices then local shops is just a cheesy way of enforcement a faux MSRP. No one buys a car at MSRP, MSRP was designed to compare models so buyers could shop arcoss different options on cars, that price was always understood as being a reference point of relative like value. Also Now that Asmodee has given an unfair advantage to a few online shops, smaller shops under them,, new online start ups will suffer. If you want free shipping at, or need a filler, you want an Asmodee game you will have to ignore supporting the online shops not blessed by Asmodee crap. Thanks but no thanks, will avoid the big online shops that carry Asmodee products too. I could not care less anout LGS. Around here, 6 of them, 4 are Comic book shops, 2 sports cards. All milking that magic crap, games board are a token business that they could not care less about.

I enjoyed it quite more than Eldritch Horror, as there is a bit more of a game in there under the terrific aesthetics. Yet the core mechanic of chasing Dracula around a map is still too simple to sustain and justify its 3 hours length, including a handful of tedious initial turns with literally nothing happening. Not my style of game nor something I'd be willing to play regularly, even though the card-based combat is far more interesting than typical dice rolling.

Gargh, why does FFG make games all look and feel the same. Even when the mechanics are different everything has this Dodge fleet look and feel to it that makes me instantly feel like I have played it before. I don't want that feeling from a new game. I hate the cover art for the 3rd Edition and my wife hates the combat mechanic (I think because she loses a lot). I want to love this, and it's really good. It's just not great.

RATING: 8
Incredibly engaging One vs. Many game. The theme is beautifully integrated and the game is very tense. As with any co-op there's some potential for quarterbacking but I haven't had too many issues with that. The only major drawback is the card-based combat is somewhat confusing and doesn't seem to mesh as well with the other mechanics.

RATING: 10
This is a stunning game. My group wanted to play again almost immediately even after the first game took about 3.5 hours. So, after a filler racing game, we did, with a different Dracula and advanced rules ... it was just as great second time around. So refined, so tense, so engaging, with very little down time. I look forward to many, many more plays.

Great game of one v all / hidden movement. Play as dracula influencing the world or the vampire hunters tasked to kill him. Each side is fun to play but be warned this game is looong. Wish I could get it to the table more!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the best version of the game. 

The main downside and a carryover from its origins in the pre-golden era of boardgames, is the unpredictable game time - a turtling Dracula and non-incisive hunters could easily see this run into three or more hours.

RATING: 8.7
A superb art design and a fantastic integration with the theme.
An "all against one" game based on the "hidden movement" mechanic are the core and the appeal of this game.
The four hunters (characters of the literary text) need to coordinate and carefully deduce the Dracula locations, whom, for his part, does not have also an easy task avoiding those hunters, though he has some tricks up his sleeve. 
The combats are still a "rock scissors paper" deal, however, things here are not so easy, as there can be some (unknown to the dracula) weapons involved and also some probability calculations (when to retreat or not, etc).
As minor drawbacks of the game, only perhaps the fact that it tends to be too long, and also the fact that a player must control more than one character when playing less than 5 players.

RATING: 6
I generally dislike hidden movement deduction games but this one brings into it some neat gameplay through card powers and quick card combat. You are ultimately trying to read your opponent but it does not simply boil down to rock-paper-scissors, though the combat is fairly simple.

The main crux of the game is spent chasing your best leads and dealing with or setting traps depending on which side you are on.

A big plus for me is not having to write down your movements and just laying down cards.

I enjoyed this, though was perhaps a little long. (When dracula escaped, I was a bit concerned that we'd have to repeat the search. But no fear - we lost soon afterwards.)

I wonder if a workable strategy would be for Van Helsing to stand still and take supplies, fed-exing them overnight to the others who are actually doing the searching.
Maybe in exchange for train tickets so he can move quickly once the hunt is on.

Another excellent game where a well-integrated theme. Could it be easily reimplemented with any of a variety of different themes? Absolutely, but it really works with this.

The mechanics are fairly straightforward, but is by no means a simple game. The stress of either side can physically effect the players, and events can happen that make the game seem like its turning around for the hunters or for Dracula, and you never are really sure who will win until its over: the hunters might spend all game getting armed to the teeth and know exactly where Dracula is the whole time, only to have him slip their grasp and make an escape. Alternatively, the hunters may have no idea where Dracula is, but Dracula is perpetually really nervous owing to always being only one move from discovery.

There's a room of room for risks, bluffs, and psychology, and a lot of the game is played in knowing who you're against, and in hiding your expressions.

Scotland Yard with bells on it, but who cares, what other game delivers an experience this fun and thematic. It's got quite a few rules, though I wouldn't say it was fiddly except for the combat. Any combat system in this game would feel adjunctive and combat itself feels like an interlude as the meat of this game is the chase. Major criticism is that it's much more fun to play as Dracula - in fact it's exquisite fun setting up roadblocks ( including actual roadblocks) to thrown off the hunters and listen to their ineffectual and erroneous planning. Another criticism is that the game - to me plays best with three. There's too much time between turns with more and you lose the conspiratorial chatter with less, and the solo player who must play all the hunters will have a largish cognitive burden tracking who has what card etc. The game drips theme. The new version,particularly the board, is lavishly produced. I'd say try it at least once, but then again I don't think you play a game once only replay it if you understand me. And I'd recommend everyone who can stomach a longer game try this one, it's one of those few times a year sort of games, and it is great.

RATING: 8.5
Played at BGGcon 2015. 

Four hunters (the characters from Stoker's novel) have to find Dracula somewhere in Europe and kill him. Dracula makes hidden moves all over the map and leaves behind traps and vampires to counter the hunters. He can win by successfully hiding his movements and defeating the hunters.

Massive improvement over the second edition. Playtime is cut way down thanks to the new combat mechanic (I hated the glorified die rolling in second). The die for railways is replaced with a far superior ticket system. The players can still get screwed, but not in a way that forces them to sit out a whole turn and do nothing.

I also strongly disliked the cards in second edition that let Dracula take away hunters' items or let him move to any location, etc. They seemed overpowered, unsatisfying, and served only to bloat the game's playing time. They seem to be absent in this new edition.

It may not impress players who are used to Whitechapel or Specter Ops, but it is exactly the Dracula game I WANTED to play when I tried out second edition.

It's an OK game but goes on for far too long. Hunter actions do not seem to be very engaging or consequential at first glance and can lose the attention of some players, leading me to believe that this game is much better for seasoned veterans who are familiar with the combat system and enjoy the slow inventory management building up to the encounters with Dracula. This is probably the only game in my collection I'd consider selling but have decided to keep it for now as its turned into a bit of a collector's item.

RATING: 7
Based on a preliminary play as Dracula, I like the game.  The theme oozes through every surface and the thrill of being chased is realized well.  We even discovered that regardless of whether the hunters sniff out the trail, maturing cards often gives hints to where Drac has been.

One thing that seems to hamper the game is that it appears, at least on the surface, to be really difficult for the hunters to deal damage.  This makes it not only difficult to hurt Drac (a winning condition), but also his thralls, which puts Drac at a distinct advantage.  Then again, this might possibly be chalked up to conservative play, but I dunno.  The only true way to deal damage is to create 3-on-1s or 4-on-1s.  Any less than that and you're barely making a dent which can be healed in any number of ways.

Can't wait to give it a shot as the hunters.

-----------

No change in rating.  Having played the hunters twice, it seems incredibly difficult to deal damage and your choice is either corner Drac or try and keep him from maturing everything.  The problem is it is extremely difficult to accomplish both at the same time because of the 3-week time limit.  I understand the need to limit the amount of time the game takes to play, but something just seems off.  You gotta be reaaaaaaally good to get Drac, I think.

It is an enjoyable game. Best part is the deduction and cat and mouse game. We actually loved that part. That was not enough.

Likely not be played again in my group. It drags on for us. When playing Dracula there is too much sitting back and downtime is more than desired.

The final stake in Dracula's chest...The combat feels like too much work. So much effort is put into finding Dracula only to be forced into a card based mini game. A mini game I find neat and fairly fun, but these mechanics just do not fit. There is simply too much emphasis put towards this part of the game. I do not like that it decides if all your hard work lets you win. Both the strategy and effort itself should determine the outcome more than it does.

Rating based on 1 5-player game where I was Dracula.  Interesting game where everyone teams up against one person who plays Dracula.  Dracula is really powerful though and seemingly impossible to beat which might make the game seem hopeless for most of the players.  It was enjoyable being Dracula though as it was rather nerve wracking running from everyone all the time, even if there was no huge threat to being defeated.  Game took a few turns to learn but otherwise wasn't too difficult.  The artwork and pieces are high quality.  Game does take a long while, 2-3 hours, and again the outcome seems inevitable.  Would like to try again from the other side and see how it feels.

Would never choose this over Letters From Whitechapel if in the mood for a hidden movement game.

RATING: 9
FFG has been on a roll lately with streamlining and refining their games, and they have a winner here as far as I’m concerned. The 2nd edition was a bloated mess and reminded me of 1st edition Mansions of Madness in that I saw the potential there but my friends weren’t interested. Fortunately, FFG has hit each one out of the park with a recent revision. 

They condensed the experience here such that the chase and the battles happen in a reasonable amount of time and without any annoying teleporting. Games can reliably go 2-3+ hours before someone will win even if it’s Dracula simply by outlasting the hunters (he starts getting 3 VP a turn). It feels as if people who truly appreciated the game sat down and said, “OK, how do we make this game [i]get there[/i] faster?” And they did. 

The big change here is the day-night mechanic whereby Hunters move by day and act by night. It makes the turn structure very clear and forces a pro-con situation on combat. Hunters only discover (and attack) Dracula at night when he is more powerful. Dracula only attacks the Hunters in the morning when they have the advantage. This sounds odd but it forces a nice attacker-defender balance. 

Our games so far have had a nice arc of tension with Dracula spawning vampires and running away but the Hunters getting lethally equipped and closing the net on the Count. As the game goes on, the Hunters are itching for the final battle while Dracula is running for his life and playing for time. 

As a fan of the theme, I’m very happy with what they did here. The rules get out of the way and you have a true cat-and-mouse game of playing out the Dracula book*. I will note that I also like Whitechapel very much and find that game much more of a deductive experience. I prefer FoD because it’s fits my tastes better by being a mix of deduction with item and event cards that provide a more lively experience. But I’m happy to own and play both. 

*I can't help but comment as a fan of the novel that despite the numerous Dracula movies, nobody has ever faithfully rendered the book. They always feel a need to make a variant of it with FF Coppola's being the worst offender IMO. If you've never read it, do yourself a favor and do so. 

[i]My revenge is just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and others shall yet be mine - my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed.'"[/i]

Errata:
1) Wolf form deals 1 damage
2) The manual says matured vampires can increase influence track by three, four, or five. It's FOUR. 
3) "Aggressive" vampire is reckless vampire

Mucha gente lo entiende como un juego para 5 jugadores, pero en mi opinión como mejor funciona es a 2, uno se esconde y el otro lo busca.

Puede que las partidas sean un poco largas, pero cuando te metes no importa (de hecho, cuando lo juegan 5 personas una o dos es fácil que queden descolgadas)

Still, I thought this game was totally bad ass.

Highly thematic! Actually, a really great thematic time.  Pretty light in terms of mechanics and thus personal engagement with the clockwork of the game. But overall everything services the theme well and that's what counts! For a first game it went on way to long.  At about 4 hours I just sent Dracula into a den of humans to see if I could mess them up and in the end they killed me. No big deal. I wanted the experience to end with some feeling of conclusion.  Certain on a next game we can keep it to 3 hours.  You just gotta make sure people are taking their turns tout suite - which is possible considering how easy the game flows.

So yeah - not my most favourite game mechanically-wise but perhaps the best horror game I've played for theme.

The board is too big and the movement per turn too small. Dracula can easily escape just by traveling on the sea. The game is very slow and very long. Dracula's ability cards remove any strategy and the game is weighted dramatically in Dracula's favor. Blah monochrone board.

Excellent implementation of Fury 2E

I love what they did streamlining the hunter turns and the combat. Drac events seem more interesting too than I remember them. The hunter events also seemed powerful as they were able to get on Drac's trail very quickly within a few turns 

The game is longer than stated, is more like 3-4h or even 5 if Drac gets pass the 3rd week. However the game is engaging throughout and everyone had a blast

Do you love ghotic lecterature? You really like vampires and Dracula themes? do you enjoy secret move mechanics and cat and mouse like kind of game? you found your boardgame. from 2 to 5 players venture in a 1890's Europe, 4 of them will play as famous vampire hunters(Mina Harker, Van Helsing, Lord Godalming and dott.r John Seeward) travelling the old continent while trying to stop Dracula(the fifth player) who secreatly tryies to expand his influence in the whole Europe looking for creating the vampire masquerade kind of thing and spreading corruption. the 4 hunters travel during daylight while night is Dracula's reign. The vampire count moves without the other players be aware of it's current position, they will need to search the cities and the villages to find clues of the Vampire passage eventually fighting the Count's minions or even the Count himmself. this game is best with all the 5 players allowed but is still very enjoyable with less
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Theme is a cross between Arkham Horror and a zombie game with combat elements akin to DungeonQuest.  As a cooperative player hunting for Dracula this is a staight forward game of hide-and-seek that starts off pretty slow and builds up to a climax.  As the hidden Dracula player this appears to be a more interesting game of stealth and deciding when and where to strike without getting trapped.  Requires four heroes to play which may be a turn off for some smaller groups.  That being said, I wish that it had more heroes to chooses from for more replayability.  Now out of print so I guess we'll never see any expansions.

I feel like I’ll always be Dracula when I play this game. I have a little under ten plays in (not logged I know!) and I’ve won every time as Dracula. I don’t think this is because I’m particularly good. It’s more because the hunters were inexperienced. I need to be better at training new players on viable strategies. That’s my one qualm with this game. You’ll enjoy it the more you play it. Your first play is more of a practice run. 

Honestly though, I love this game! I’m excited for when I can play it as a hunter.

I'm still not sure if this one is fun. It's a long, sprawling, sometimes unfair-feeling endeavour that's dripping with thematic elements. I love the core gameplay of picking up Dracula's trail and chasing him around Europe. Combat is a bit rock-paper-scissors at times, and this can make the actual encounters with Dracula fall flat. Not sure it offers enough to pay off the time investment, but it's a lovely thing nevertheless.

1 vs 1 playthrough so far and I loved it alot! we did not play with any of the extra vampire powers, which was probably a good thing because I think this game naturally errors to the side of dracula. I loved the "rock, paper, scissors" concept of combat. I'd feel a rush as I started  thinking "is she thinking what I'm thinking shes thinking? Or is she just thinking what I'm thinking? Or does she have a trump card I should be worried about. Glad I bought this game. Also I loved the hidden movement of the game. My sister chased me across the world! Everytime I moved "please don't move there please don't move there... ****! she moved there" 

The one caveat which might be big for some is that dracula's turns are insanely short. partly because I was able to think of 2 different plans while my sister was taking her turn, allowing me to move instantly. I think the game would actually speed up with more people because with only 2 people my sister had to play all four hunters! Besides that one point I loved the game!

RATING: 8.5
This game is amazing.  It's everything I love about Letters from Whitechapel with layers of story and thematic interaction piled on.  Outstanding game.

UPDATE: my only complaint is that I really can't stand Fantasy Flight's way of writing rulebooks.  I have to look in the Learn to Play, Rules Reference, FAQ & Errata, AND read every card to find out exactly what to do in a given scenario.  If we play this game a lot and get used to it I'm sure it will run more smoothly, but I have other games I play as infrequently and don't have this kind of fiddly rules problem.  The MOMENTS in this game are incredible and immersive and thematic and wonderful.  It's getting to those moments that bugs me.  And the game runs a little long.  Our group ended a game short tonight because it ran too long and everybody was tired and wanted to go home.  I think it's a noon-start kind of game day game.  Well worth setting aside time for it, and it will reward frequent plays to wrap your head around all the rules, but for the rare play it's been a rough go.

Tense and generally quite exciting, this is a beautifully-themed hidden movement game with great artwork and components (though the minis are rather poor).   The enormous board would serve well for a wargame situated in Europe.  

There can be some downtime if the hunters aren't finding any leads and Dracula isn't accomplishing anything, and it can be very easy for Dracula to accidentally "cheat".  The game also seems to drag on a bit too long  (3+ hours).

Like Letters From Whitechapel on steroids. The chase is thrilling, combat is simple but not a luck-fest, and while the game might take a while depending on who's playing, there is essentially a finite number of turns so it won't take forever.
Complaints: the box art is derpy and the rulebooks are not as clear as they should be. But these are minor gripes.

I'd only played 2nd edition twice.  The first time was pretty great, but the next time got bogged down in combat dice rolls and also included a Drac restart with Teleport, or whatever that card is called.  So that kind of soured me on that.  But this new edition is great.  Plays smoothly in about 2 hours and updates just the right stuff.

This might be my favorite 1-vs-all hidden movement game.  This beats out Letters from Whitechapel or Spectre Ops because there is more to do than just 'finding' the hidden mover.  Hunters can acquire improvements and weapons to build some strategic thinking, and Dracula does more than just hide cultivating a rising terror level and laying traps.

M'agradaria provarlo, però l'hi veig uns quants problemes:
- 1 vs 4: un jugador sempre ha de fer de Dracula i, tot i que diuen que és més divertit fer de Dracula que de Hunter, aixo no m'acaba d'agradar.
- Downtime: tothom es queixa que entre torns hi ha molt downtime, especialment si hi ha combat.
- 5 players only: comparteix num de jugadors amb el Galactica...

Crec que és un joc que m'agradaria però que no el jugaria mai, ja sigui per el num de jugadors, o perque ningú voldria fer de hunter...

Actualització després de jugarlo: Molt bon joc, és divertit tant per el jugador que fa de Drácula com per la resta. Sembla bastant anivellat i si Drácula no comet cap error greu és emocionant fins el final.

A game that takes that mechanic from Scotland Yard, improves it a lot and adds some other things to make it more compelling and interesting. To all Dracula fans, this game is a must tested (for big Dracula fans game could easily be 9/10). I like the theme, art style and quality of components (high standards of FFG). It is thrilling to play as Dracula and either try avoid the hunters all together (because time works for Dracula's advantage) or try to take down your hunters one by one. Asymmetric game-play, with hidden movements etc. A great game, even for those who don't care about the theme. But as always with highly thematic games, if you enjoy the theme, it's easier to sink into the story and atmosphere, which always improves a game a lot. Combat system is the worst thing about the game, I can't say I really like it. From Dracula-player's point of view, combats are way too hard to beat. Vanishing in the middle of battle becomes very often the better decision for the Dracula than seeing the battle to the end. But because battles are not the driving force of the game or even the things that keep players tied to the game, it's not a major problem. Annoying, but not a killjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dracula is a bit too powerful. The key is to find him and then escape. Once you can gang up on him, then you have a chance. Hunters must build up their item and event cards to defeat Dracula. This is a very long game, but it can be discouraging too. Sometimes you end the game and you're just drained wondering why you spent so much time not laughing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So far I can say the following: Dracula is having fun. The hunters find him rather quickly, and the first battles come soon. The feeling of being hunted is strong, and fighting cool. The hunters, on the other hand, tended to be somewhat less amused so far: their options in combat felt limited, and once they had Dracula really cornered, he became a bat and flew away! Felt a bit like starting from zero. The combination of deduction and then quite some luck of the rock/paper/scissors/magic-escape sort is not for everybody. But I want to do it again.

You could not design a game less for me than this one if you tried to. I think the biggest problem for me is that I do not find the core puzzle of deducing where Dracula could be engaging at all. Perhaps if it was contained within a game that was not seemingly designed to last forever, it might hold my interest longer, but as it is, it seems that skillful and/or lucky play by Dracula results in a game where *nothing happens* for hours. For at least 2 of the 3 times I've played this, we've called the game at the 3 hour mark when it was clear that we had at least 1-2 more hours remaining.

I do have to give this game credit for something though. It's the perfect illustration to me that what constitutes good game design is ultimately a subjective thing, as lots of people, including friends of mine, clearly love to play this game and it's unlikely they are all pretending to like it just to mess with me. :-D

I was so glad to finally be able to play this game after all the praise many gave it. I really enjoyed my one and only play of this game. Fury of Dracula has pretty simple to grasp mechanics for both Hunters and Dracula, combat is rewarding and tense and the game drips with theme. So why only a "7?" 

The problem is the game takes waaay too long. My first game with 5 players took nearly 4 hours. Even though the first fourth of the game we were all new and learning all the things we could do, for the next 75% of the game, our turns (both night and day) took less than a minute, yet the game still drags. And to me that's a demerit since in this day and age it can very hard to have players focus that long. I do not mind it as much and some other people in the group that played don't either. But two players started losing interest around hour two and the Dracula player had to start time-crunching on their turns because it was getting late.

I understand the thematic reasoning why the hunters can't travel during night but I almost house-ruled this because that alone added about an extra hour to the game time. Also I didn't play with Lairs or rumors because I felt that would add another hour to the game's length. 

I'm conflicted on this one, after playing Specter Ops which I have played at the full compliment and was about an hour and a half shorter, but still gave me the same thrill of Fury of Dracula. I really like this game greatly and I chose to trade it away because I know I will probably never be able to get it to the table again. Maybe if they release a 4th Edition they will find a way to mitigate the time length. 

UPDATE: I have been able to re-acquire a copy of this now OoP game, and can't wait to play it again. After thinking it over, my last play of this game was made longer due partly to the fact two players were literally absent the entire game. Also the least experienced was Dracula for our first run-through. I can't wait to try it again, maybe the forums have a few "fixes" that help with game length.

The only thing preventing me from giving this a higher rating is the playtime. Don't get me wrong, every minute of this is worth it! I just can't say I always want to play it, as I have games that I prefer at that length.

The combat mechanic is excellent, and there truly is some deduction to be made. You're not just wandering around hoping to be lucky; you actually have facts to rely on, whether to know where Dracula could be or to know where he couldn't be. I highly recommend this to anyone who has the time to play it! (note : I've only played one game so far, as Abraham Van Helsing).

This is game is a bit of a commitment to have it hit the table but it is worth it when you do. Cards can feel pretty swingy and combat is a real nail-biter but it is dripping with awesome theme and mechanics that support it. I am in love with the Dracula movement track and the simple mystery of tracking the vampire lord down on any given turn. Couple that with bluffs and double bluffs and this game is a real winner.

Such a better edition! My go do deduction game. Love the varied mix of hunters and their powers. Also dracula can do more to the hunters than just run. He can set traps and fight (at night). Seems a much tighter game than the previous.

I think when you start playing for the first couple of games, you shouldn't use wolf form or any of the 5 power cards.  I think this game is best with 3.  With 5 the game is not interesting enough for the hunters.  Playing with 3 keeps the game shorter as well.

One play only, most of us enjoyed it (myself included) but perhaps not one for impatient payers - it evolves slowly as the tension mounts but unless the hunters get lucky early on it's a longish game.

Very good one-against-the-rest with the one secretly plotting his/her movement game in the same genre as Scotland Yard (and many others). I love the look, the implementation of the theme and the growing sense of tension as the clock ticks away while Dracula's life ebbs away ...

The rulebook could be a little stronger, but there are many useful youtube videos, as well as forums here on BGG. All in all I have fallen in love with this game.

Si os gusta la temática del príncipe de las tinieblas este juego es una delicia visual, preciosa reedición.

Para disfrutarlo es necesario que el jugador que lleve a drácula se lo curre bastante y le ponga el punto a la i. 
Muchas veces no se sabrá quien es realmente el ratón y quien el gato, puede dar la sensación de que drácula juega con ventaja, pero una vez juegas varias veces empiezas a ver las herramientas disponibles para cada bando y como usarlas para mayor beneficio.

En sí el juego es de mecánicas simples, varias opciones de acción durante dos fases: día y noche para los investigadores. Y una fase de drácula en la que irá moviendose por el tablero sin volver sobre sus pasos, jugando eventos y dejando cartas ocultas de trampas que le irán acercando a la victoria.
Los combates están bien resueltos mediante un piedra, papel, tijera con diversas cartas que agilizan bastante y mantienen tensión en los encuentros.

Si no os molesta el 1 vs todos y echar un par de horas jugando a un temático os gustará!

Moderately enjoyable one-versus-many that has a nice thematic dimension, but I'd describe it as having long stretches of relative inactivity punctuated by periods of one or maybe a couple players doing things via combat. The rock-paper-scissors combat of the third edition is ... alright. There's some stratagem and psychologizing as you try to outthink the opponent, but it's really just a guess at the end of the day and not much less random than dice throws, say. The production, save for the horrid cover art, is good (although there's a noticeable seam running through the middle of the board).

FFG's recent practice of bifurcating the rulebooks into learn-to-play and rules reference reaches something of a nadir here, as the LTP feels scattershot and elliptical and the RRG is, as usual, unsuitable as a way to learn a game, compounded by a topic division that I found harder than normal to reference (things not being where I thought they would be). Really, FFG. You're not really doing anyone any favors, I don't think, by pretending in the LTP that the game is simpler than it. Just give me one damn rulebook, please, and leave the LTP/RRG split for miniatures and card games, where the level of technical detail that a separate RRG could provide would be justifiable.

Very much enjoyed my first play.  Thematic, tense, fun.  Look forward to more plays to really get a better feel.

An improvement to an already good game, this game sees players take on the role of hunting Dracula. The deduction element is maintained (similar to games like Mr X) and combat has been significantly improved.

2 additional components would've made this game immensely better: a card rack (to hold up cards for Dracula to see) and a plastic thingamagick to prop up event cards (since players draw from the bottom of the deck).

Other than that, no complaints, still an excellent game for 5 players.

Much more polished and elegant than previous versions, with a nicely sharpened-up combat system, and clear-text cards instead of fiddly chits.

What's up with that card Dracula has that basically lets him cheat and throw off the hunters' count? The whole point of the game was looking at whether Drac played a land or sea travel card and eliminating possibilities. Once it was revealed he could straight-up fudge the numbers, we lost interest. Too long a game for such shenanigans!

Preliminary rating because I only played the basic game.
Dracula is interesting, although you often wait for the hunters. When the hunter players are very careful with the events cards Dracula gets very few cards to play with (I had just one events card for the whole game).
A bit too long for my taste. The first game probably took over four hours.

Playing as Dracula is very exciting, but sadly my friends who got to play as the hunters didn't seem to enjoy the game half as much.
I'll give it an 8 and the benefit of doubt, but the final rating will depend on my experience as the hunter.

*the hunter role in the first game was so dissapointing I could not (and didn't really want to either) get the game to the table
*unrefined ruleset filled with one-off exceptions + the classic incoherent FFG manual didn't help

This edition features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanics. Rounds are now broken into day and night: hunters take actions during both, but Dracula can only act at night. Combat is now more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game.

I own the 2nd edition and now had a chance to play the third edition. In general, there is a lot of improvement and interesting mechanics, but in the end I might not be tempted to replace my game and simply replace some of the old mechanics with the new ones.

New stuff that are cool:

- You need to fight the vampire on the tracks, they have HP, instead of instant kill
- Dracula seems much more powerful as will found him on third turn and he managed to win.
- There is no more dice, train dice is replaced with tickets and combat now only use RPS.
- There is now a day and night phase on each turn which makes it more thematic and logical. It's a way to split the turn in 2 actions similar to eldritch horror.
- Components are different, dracula tokens are now placed on cards which makes more sense.
- They fixed the map to prevent blocking the map with an evenly host.
- They removed the resolve action which was just game breaking.

The Problems

Now all those new ideas but it comes with many drawbacks:

- The color Scheme and graphic design is horrible. I am not sure if it's because I am color blind, but card location for dracula's strack are barely visible. The card's back are so dark that it's hard to distinguish them. The map is hard to read.
- The game is way... longer. Expect at least 4 hours instead of 3. Doing 2 actions not at the same time is one of the reason for those delays.
- Else it could be the fact that it's much more complex and confusing than the original game with all the phases of the day, so there is a lot of ambiguity.
- The combat cards are semi confusing, they made each icons to know whoch hunter card counters which dracular ability ... but they stopped there, so there are many other counter affect not expressed as icons.
- Water movement is much more expensive, so there is little interest to use the boats for dracula.

So there are some nice ideas, but I might just adapt the second edition instead.

A fun hidden movement game with great combat. It seems to be a bit hard for the Dracula though. Also it feels a bit shallow at times, I would like it to have a bit more stuff to do in the game for the hunters. Still, a good game for the occasional mood of one vs. many.

Great update of a classic game.  Love the components, the thing oozes theme, and the instructions are clear albeit with a few exceptions that it took some digging to clarify.

The only reason this game isn't a 9.0 score for me is its length.  It's a LONG game and if you are playing it during the evening make sure you start early.  Our first couple of games ran 30-45 minutes longer than the 3 hour maximum on the box.  I'm sure with repeated plays it will be shorter.

Other than its (current) length I cannot find fault with it.

Absolutely abysmal game.  Myself and another guy were the hunters searching for Dracula.  We found him twice during the entire game.  The encounters resulted in one of my guys getting beat to a pulp while another character was stuck in a fog for a few turns.  You just move space to space asking the player controlling Dracula if they were ever in that town.  The game is divided up into just over three weeks, each day in those weeks and a day and night turn in each day.  You can only move during the day.  Because of that ridiculous restriction, here is how our game played out:

(A hunter moves to Budapest) "Were you (Dracula) ever here?"
Dracula Player:  "No."

(Another hunter moves to Zurich) "Were you ever in this town?"
Dracula Player: "No."

Imagine doing this for two hours.  

It's insane and defies the current 7.7 average rating for this game here on BoardGameGeek.  Unbelievably horrible waste of time.  The game ended with myself and the other hunter player in absolute tears from laughter wondering, at one point in the game, what Mina Harker could do in a fog.  The reply was, "Well you can't fight, you can't move and you can't draw cards, but you can do anything else."  That's pretty much most of the things you'll usually want to do in the game.  I guess I'll just sit here and watch the clock not move.

This game is VERY group dependent. I really, REALLY like Fury of Dracula.

But some of it's fiddly rules and the fact that it's a long game with a lot of... nothing happening. Can mean that it falls flat.

It's a hard game to teach, a hard game to play and very frustrating for both sides. But it's SUPPOSED to be frustrating for both sides. That's both the beauty and the curse of this unique 1 vs many game.

I would like this to hit the table a couple more times to really get a feel for it. It's tough to find the right time to pull out a 3+ hour game that is designed for 5 players.

I love this game! It to me feels pretty balanced between dracula and the hunters and has a fun hidden movement mechanic coupled with amazing theming. There are 2 reasons it is not a ten for me. Enjoyment of the game really hinges on the other people playing, if you have hunters that aren't paying attention and discussing with other hunters than the experience can be brought down a bit. the other reason is also dependant of played, but if anyone, especially the dracula player, tries to math out every option you can kind of suffer from analysis paralysis and it will slow down the game. The game is long already but it doesn't feel long unless you're waiting on other peoples decisions for 5 or 10 minutes.

I also haven't played 2 player but i feel like that would slow the game down more and be less fun

A fully Ameritrashified version of Letters of Whitechapel. Like Whitechapel you have to go into the game if you are Dracula that you mostly want to run away and not fight except for rare instances, whilst the heroes try to tighten the net. Fury of Dracula also throws in additional actions, special abilities, and all these event and item cards that while adding overhead really spices up the game. I really like how Dracula is setting all of these traps as he runs away instead of just being a complete weenie.

While initially I was playing pretty randomly for combat because I didn't know which cards have what icons and also if you don't have many items your options are limited, eventually the whole icon thing made combat pretty streamlined while having some tactical and hand management aspects and evoking the uniqueness of different cards. 

EDIT: Game can overstay its welcome and actions are broken up in a way that make it feel like you aren't accomplishing much each turn despite the long rounds , but I think its core rules are actually not that more complicated than say Pandemic. and I really like the idea of the encounter cards of having to clean up the mess left behind my Dracula's plotting.

This is a great game. Very thematic. Very tense and balanced. In the first three 2 player games Dracula has won but it has been very, very close with multiple confrontations happening. I think 3 people would be the ideal player count. The only issue is that it does go pretty long. 

Previously owned because I gave my copy to a friend for Christmas but I get to play it with them so it's almost as good!

I own 2nd edition and was very excited for an updated version. The artwork is beautiful and when the game is setup it's stunning to behold. I need to get in a few more plays, but for some reason this version plays incredibly slowly. The dawn/dusk mechanic really takes some time to get your head around, and the rules are not the best FFG has produced. Combat is somewhat improved, but still feels clunky. Nothing really flows smoothly for me in this game. Card interactions stall the game as we tried to figure out how to use items like garlic in a multi-hunter combat. We ended up playing for 2.5 hours, got to the second week on the time track and lost interest.

Thematic hide and seek game, however the downtime when someone is fighting Dracula is very significant. It maybe fun to watch the first few times, but the fun gets die down rather easily.
Playing as Dracula is much more interesting than playing humans.
Edited on 14/8/2017: Played 1 more game while Nam Kong as Dracula. As almost all of us have played this game before (except Bun), the game now runs smoothly. We do made mistakes, like I transfer the card 'Blood Transfusion' to Wilson, who has a bite token! Rating up to 7 from 6.5.

This edition of Fury of Dracula is great. I think the only negative I can point to is that the art from the second edition is better. On the positive side, it is much more streamlined. Some of the chrome has been taken out. Down time between player turns has been reduced (in part because of the removal of minor combats with Dracula's minions). Combat between Dracula and the Hunters has been improved. Another big improvement is switching encounters from obtuse cardboard counters to cards with the text of what they do written on them.

I really like that the "insta teleport" cards were eliminated. They were present in the previous edition and made the game very difficult and annoying.

Rating based on 5 players.

A similar type of game to Letters from Whitechapel, but is less "pure" deduction. There are more random elements and swings that makes it less of a head-to-head battle, but the theme and game narrative are stronger in this one--I would say it wins in the "fun" category, but it's definitely less think-y. This one is definitely more conducive to playing in a group too (for LfW, I personally would not want to play as an investigator with other people on my team, while for FoD it's the opposite). A little bit fiddly.

A hidden movement game. Where 4 players hunt for Dracula, while the 5th secretly moves Dracula around the board. Dracula wins by out lasting everyone, and can shorten the game clock by making more vampires. The hunters win by killing Dracula. The game works amazingly, with a great co-op feel and surprisingly little alpha gaming. can be long, but is full of excitement.

I've only played this once at the time of this writing, and this game was fun, but it did have the issue of being a bit slower/longer. Since the main objective is to not be caught as Dracula, there is a lot of time where Dracula is just moving around and the players don't do anything.

I'm glad I got it as it is now out of print, but it's not the knockout game I was expecting, still very fun but I doubt I'll be playing it a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fury of Dracula is a 1 vs. all, hidden movement, and deduction game.  In it, one player is Dracula, and the other one to four player(s) is/are the hunter(s).  The game is best with a full compliment of five players.  This allows everyone to focus on their own character.  Dracula wins as soon as he scores 13 influence points.  The hunters win as soon as they deal 15 points of damage to Dracula thereby killing him.

At first blush the game is very simple.  Hunters take a single day action, then they take a single night action.  Then Dracula moves, and seeds his new location with some nasty trap that may be sprung on the hunters, if they should happen to stumble upon his trail.

The many problems occur when the hunters interact with Dracula and/or his minions that he leaves along the way.  This is because the rules are a bloody (see what I did there) mess!  The game comes with a players guide, and a rules reference book.  Two books.  These two books are in turn vague, open to interpretation, and at times even contradict each other!  The rules suck...no, really.  There is an errata and FAQ that you can print off.  So, now we're up to three places you can go to for rules.  However, mind-bogglingly this document also doesn't address all the inconsistencies of the books.  When you throw in the many cards, and the rules tweaks they have, there's a lot of literature that needs to be sifted through to get any kind of grasp on how to properly play the game.

There is good news.  If you like hidden movement games in the vein of Scotland Yard, or Letters from Whitechapple, and you have the patients to fight through terribly written rules, knowing you're going to play at least your first game incorrectly, then you will enjoy this game.

It's really fun.  I don't typically like long games, and this one can run up to around 3 hours, but between the theme and the action on the board it keeps me engaged.  As a hunter you feel lost at first, not knowing any information about Dracula's whereabouts.  You are desperate to get on his trail as soon as possible, because eventually he will get points at an excellerated rate.  As Dracula you feel like you are always only one step ahead of the hunters.  Once they do get onto you, evading them is very difficult.  Dracula has the advantage early, when the hunters are working with nothing.  The hunters have the advantage later, once they are on the trail, and are mercilessly putting the squeeze on Dracula.

RATING: 10
This is the most thematic game I own.  What I mean by that is if you can't remember what a rule is, you can just think "what would my character do ("in real life")?" and it clicks, without needing to consult the rule book.  Of course Dracula is weakened on the sea, he is eating rats.  Of course the hunters don't move at night, that would be too dangerous.  I love everything about it and my game group has had absolutely the most fun playing.  I haven't even been Dracula yet!  We've only played with 3 and 4 but I believe it would be just as much fun with 2, as one person can easily control all of the hunters.  By far the best Hidden Movement game on the market if you ask me.

One play through so far, as Dracula.

+ Deduction/Deception aspect is interesting. It'll probably see more plays with the group I primarily play with than Tragedy Looper since the deduction aspect is lighter.
- The large white crease where the board folds inwards is a bit ugly.
+ Very thematic, particularly with Castlevania music running in the background.

More plays needed to further qualify this game.

I've played this three times now, twice as hunters and once as Dracula. The game seems pretty biased towards Dracula winning over the Vampire Hunters, but i bet with repeat plays that would be less true. It's a long game but really worth it; i'm glad i got my copy before it went out of print.

Easily my favorite hidden movement game. Tension is very high as the hunters chase down Dracula. Risk/reward for Dracula with placing encounters in hideouts can lead to some nail-biting moments for Drac. Combat in 3rd ed is very well streamlined; I am a huge fan of the rock/paper/scissors combat. It might not alwayd be the best fit for a game night, but when it does get played, every game is memorable.

Fury is an an excellent Hidden Movement game. It's slightly biased towards Dracula and with skilled players Dracula has a definite advantage, but there are design balances that help like not being able to backtrack without Vampire Powers that helps Hunters deduce his movements.  I find the gameplay isn't as tight and balanced as Spec Ops but  it's still very exciting and exhilarating. EFTAIOS is still the best, but this gives another flavor of Hidden Movement and I hope the genre grows further.

I really liked the second edition, and at first it seemed like many of the new rules were going to make this version even better, but after playing it it's clear that by removing the many combat encounters which Dracula used to be able to throw down in the hunter's path, the game has become incredibly boring.  After about two hours without a single combat encounter and Dracula continually eluding the hunters we decided to call it quits, put the game away and played something more engaging.

Freshly bought and already intensely played (and loved). This is really an excellent gothic adventure, thematic, intense but still very smooth. 
It's a mix of [b]deduction[/b] ("Land, sea, land... let's see all the possible spots he could've reached"), [b]bluff[/b] ("You think I'm running away but I'm hiding under your nose!") and [b]push your luck[/b] (draw Events at night, risking to favour Drac? Fight another combat round and maybe delivering the killing blow?).

Each side is very fun to play and has its nuances. Components are fantastic (small rant for the crease in the board, really stands up against the dark background); I foresee rules' FAQs incoming. But overall, it's a great game, glad to have it in my collection.

This game has a good set of mechanics, including a brilliant hidden player movement mechanic. However, even with these mechanics the game feels really empty; almost nothing is happening if Dracula is not visible and most of the actions end up relying on luck. It is not rare to play the whole game and at the end notice that you have done nothing but moved around the Europe. The game just drags way too long when thinking about its content.

To me, it seems like the only way to enjoy and stay involved in the game is to play as Dracula.

I typically don't like hidden movement games, but Fury of Dracula is probably my favorite of the genre. It's incredibly thematic, for one thing. Also, the hunters are doing more than just moving around the board trying to corner the hidden character. They can fortify themselves for combat, or utilize event cards to swing things their way. Best of all, the Dracula character has a lot of control over where and how they move, and they can leave traps behind to spring on the hunters. 

That all being said, this game feels pretty ancient. This may be the third edition, but it definitely feels like a game from the 80's. The game runs long, and many times it comes down to a single, crucial fight to see who will ultimately win or lose. It's very difficult to recover from losing this battle if you're the hunters, as Dracula is very hard to catch if he can slip away from the hunters. Especially considering the fact that Dracula has a lot of control on how long a fight goes, this can make for a very anti-climactic experience where the game feels like it's over long before it actually is. I have fun with Fury of Dracula, but it isn't really my style of game.

By this point the hunters were on my trail and I had a real sense of being hemmed in.  Narrowly escaped into the English Channel when we called it a night.

Even so, I think I played very poorly as Dracula.  We got all the way to the second despair token without me having garnered a single point of influence.  

It was hysterical to listen to the "logical" deductions the hunters were making that so aften sent them in the wrong direction.  What was Van Helsing doing in Athens while I was in Manchester?  Lots of tricks, bluffs and nuances to learn :-)

REALLY like this one.

It took a long time to get Fury thanks to it being out of print when I got into the hobby.  It took some time to get around to it, but the end of the FFG/GW relationship got me to take the plunge and pick it up.  This game is the full bodied hidden movement experience.  The mechanisms all work well and the tension is strong start to finish.  Would rate even higher if the gameplay was under 3 hours, but it is still held in high regard.

RATING: 8
Heavy-weight classic of the hidden movement genre, in which one player plays as the uber-powerful Dracula as the rest of the players try to hunt him as he rampages through Europe. 3rd ed. features new streamlined rules for combat that manage to keep things focused on the hunt itself, and a better turn structure that reduces downtime and fosters cooperation. This is the version to get if you can find it, even if the "videogame concept-art" art-style that FFG now uses for everything clashes with the theme and feels like a downgrade from the original.

Not for those on a time-limit, as defeating Dracula can take more than a few hours, specially if all the optional powers are used.

Great stealthy mechanics, just feels kind of awkward playing the game for so long for a few moments of intense interaction if/when you happen to find Dracula. Would be neat to play as Dracula though.

Most likely will not pick it up, don't like the business model of the new company that took FFG over. Driving prices artificially higher, undermining all online shops except a few big online shops that have store fronts, like CSI, this doesn't go down well with me. Seems to be a method to reduce online competition to just one of two that the distributor can control and in the long haul, hurts the hobby. Give me a free market.

Why is this game so famous? It lasts forever and simple mistakes from the hunters can drag this for an extra hour or so. Worst yet, the hunters have very limited actions, so it feels very boring to play as one. The Dracula player seemed to have had some fun, but even he admitted that it didn't look nice to be a hunter.

Also, as it seems common with FFG, it has an awfully designed rulebook and rules. You can see that just by checking the length of the unofficial FAQs here at BGG.

You can have more fun for less time in many other games.

Fury of Dracula strikes all the right chords for me personally, and may be my favorite board game to-date. This is a one-versus-many hidden movement game, where one player takes on the role of the eponymous fiend while one-to-four other players give chase across late 19th century Europe with all four of the game's hunters. Hidden movement games are not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy that sort of thing and have a soft spot for this theme, you may find yourself with an unquenchable thirst to play FoD again and again. The trouble is, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find and thus more expensive. There is news that a reprint or new edition is coming soon.

Not sure whether I like this better than the original version, but definitely prefer 3rd edition over 2nd.

Good hidden movement game. Fun theme, and both sides are enjoyable to play. Benefits from repeat play as people are able to resolve actions much quicker and strategies improve... but a big enough game that it's hard to get on the table often.

Ended up trading my copy away just because lengthy playing time meant it wasn't played often enough. Doesn't affect my enjoyment or opinion of the game, though.

I've played a few of these iterations of Scotland Yard and I'm not really a fan. They tend to be quite long, with little for the hunters to do, making them rather boring for everyone except the single hunted player. Fury Of Dracula is no exception. I'd rather play Nuns On The Run.

I liked it quite a bit more than I thought I would. It was tense and felt fairly close the entire game. Even when we thought we had Dracula fairly well cornered (and we did), he had some good tricks up his sleeve, and was probably only a few turns away from winning when we finally killed him.

All that said, this is not a game that I want to play often. Once a year, maybe. It's pretty long, and hidden movement is not my thing at all.

Been wanting to play this game for a long time and I finally did with the full force of the hunters versus a very sneaky, conniving Dracula. This revised and updated, one-versus-all deduction and action game blends the hidden movement mechanic from Letters of Whitechapel and card-based combat. Almost every mechanic is dedicated to preserving the theme and fidelity of the Dracula myth; from his overwhelming power in 1-on-1 fights to his weakness upon the open sea to the nefarious and secret traps he sets for his hunters, Fury of Dracula really keeps the four hunters on their toes, making a tense and thrilling game. Unfortunately, Dracula (especially ours) utilized a lot of metadata to trick us in the wrong direction which is not against the rules but it makes for a very unexciting game that ends in a shrug. Also, because the hunters have to work cooperatively, there is the chance of one player quarterbacking the whole game, telling others where to go and what to do. Although this is one of the most thematic and tricky games I've played, ultimately, I believe it's a long climb for a short slide. The game is set up to incentivize a passive and sneaky Dracula, not a combat-based, fast-moving one. But I'm glad to have played it and experienced the full game of Fury of Dracula.

Awesome game! I played the 2nd edition and enjoyed it, but there were a few issues which detracted from the fun. I am happy to say that these have been fixed for this edition.
I enjoy the hidden movement mechanic and the cat-and-mouse hunt, but there is so much more going on. I think the paper-scissors-stone combat is fun and the events, encounters and items decks interesting, if a little random.
It can play a little long, especially if the hunters are not entirely focussed. However, with the right group, it is thoroughly enjoyable.

I've played the second edition many times and love it. This one is similar in many ways but also have a lot of anal changes that combine to make the play different enough. The turns alter between day and night causing the hunters strategy to be quite different and Dracula has more power and is more fun to play as the confrontations are more interesting. Well worth a try whether you love the older edition or not.

Maybe it was just our first play of this, but it felt like too much blindly stumbling around until you pick up on Dracula. After that, good luck doing damage to him. He constantly destroyed our weapons, did massive amounts of damage to us and was in general just too strong.

I vastly prefer Letters over this game even though this is a far more interesting theme.

Update: Alright after reading the Learn to Play guide, I'd be more apt again to trying this game. I still feel like it has a lot of kinks to be worked out, but we had a ton of minor rule messups and a few VERY large rules errors. It might bump the game up a point or two, but even so, I still prefer Letters instead of this.

Got my first play and and LOVED it.  Cannot wait to play again.  I have heard some say this replaced Specter Ops for them, but I don't see that.  They are different enough and this game is a little longer and deeper, so Specter Ops would fill a lot of what this game does when I don't necessarily have time for this one.  I know it went longer than normal as it was our first play, but I can see where it would definitely take more commitment than a play of Specter Ops.

Played two games as a hunter. Both ended in defeat after a week and a half. I struggle to see how Dracula doesn't score his bonus token ASAP 90+% of the time, and having done that, I struggle to see how he could lose. It didn't help that I was Van Helsing, and my success rate on event card draws over 2 games was 5 out of 16.

2 hours of fumbling over your own feet searching for a needle in a haystack, followed by 10 minutes of getting slaughtered by Dracula. No thanks.

A great themed deduction game that improves on the second edition in many ways, yet still cannot get the rules straight!

Pros:
* Feels very balanced.
* High production quality.
* Streamlined game play from the second edition, especially for combat.
* Removes cumbersome rules for moving by train from the second edition.

Cons:
* -.5 for having the rules nonsensically spread out between two different rule books making locating them a waste of time. This game has one of the worst rule book(s) of any game I own.
* -.5 because some rules are still not clear even after the 3rd edition! How is it possible this game has [url=https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/47/b7/47b7b483-17b1-4724-a404-0889774f84f6/furyofdracula_faq_v10.pdf]errata[/url] and this ridiculous [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1466013/unofficial-faq]Unofficial FAQ[/url]?

* Game time is still long but you are having so much fun the time flies by.
* Dracula's miniature should be black.

One of the original games I bought when discovering the hobby. Though it is one of several "one vs all", cat and mouse such games, in my mind it stands head and shoulders above the rest. Though I might seem biased as Dracula is one of my favorite novels of all time, the theme really does hit perfectly. Interested in what the reprint will bring but its hard to imagine it will beat Fantasy Flight's reputable production value. Every time I have played it came right down to the wire, always a thrilling experience for both Dracula and the Hunters. Bounces around my top 3 and don't foresee that changing anytime soon.

I played one of the previous version in the past (it has too be a long time ago, as I didn't log it, so it has to be in those earlies days when I didn't knew the existance of BGG yet), and I hadn't a positive memory of that game as it was a frustrating expierence for the hunters and this game just took ages.

But this is a 3rd edition, so you could expect they improved the game, so I agreed on playing Wouter's copy. Well, it's still as bad as I remembered as it has for me the same to problems: it takes way too long and being a hunter is just frustrating. Most of the times (I think 40 - 50%) I had the feeling that my night action was just useless, as you can't move during the night, I already had my 2 traintickets and I new Dracula hadn't been in my location which meant searching is also useless en to supply is to tricky at night and certainly not worth it if you're not in a big city).

Dracula can escape too easily and it's way too hard to catch up and find the trail again.

OWN: 2ND & 3RD EDITIONS

3rd Edition comments...

There are quite a lot of changes from 2nd Edition, some small, some larger. Mostly for the better, but time will tell. The combat in particular is a vast improvement. Reports so far indicate balance has improved (Dracula was supposedly slightly disadvantaged in 2E). Most of all though, it remains an extremely fun & theme-heavy game. Just beware there is a certain time investment required in digesting the rules (particularly with the ambiguities/errors!), and the game can run for a few hours. But that depth is what makes this game, with opportunity for players to develop various stretegies, and so many ways for Dracula to bluff & misdirect the hunters.

WARNING: 3rd Edition contains several misprints/typos. Nothing too drastic though, and thankfully none have been reported on the cards as yet, just the rules.
eg. Vampire matured = 3 or 4 influence track increase (not 3/4/5 as per one reference in rules)
eg. Wolf Form = 1 wound (not 2 as per one reference in rules)
eg. one confusing mention of Aggressive Vampire => should read "Reckless Vampire" (guess it was renamed)
...and many more!!!

---
Original comments based on 2nd Edition...

Great integration of theme and plenty of depth. Very clever cards allow for hidden movement of Dracula and clues are gradually revealed to the hunters.

Plays well with only 2 players, although the hunters can be quite an effort for one person (managing all the cards and abilities effectively enough to keep up with Dracula).

If only the game could run a little shorter (maybe with more experience). Scotland Yard makes for a much lighter & quicker alternative, but Garibaldi: La Trafila gets my vote over either - it plays almost as quickly as Scotland Yard with much of the depth of FoD.

WARNING: Rules are lengthier than needed, and poorly organised.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The third edition (as opposed to the second edition) feels very heavyly tilted towards Dracula. "Escape as Bat" and "Wolf Form" are just too powerful, and make following dracula's trail almost impossible.

One step forward, two steps back. The weapons used in fights are clearer than in the second edition. However they've at the same time broken the game with the above mentioned changes.

One player vs. all, hidden movement. Hunting down and deterministic combat (card casting, rock-paper-scissors style). Atmospheric mechanics, but linked to a little bit heavier weight/complexity.
Theme may being a little dark, game length probably too much for us. Better with more players, 2 player experience lacking.

I liked this a lot; I like Scotland Yard and like that it's not focused just on finding Dracula, but also fighting him. Bits might be unbalanced but I couldn't really tell from one playing.

I EXPECTED: A cat and mouse style trail found to be riddles with clues. An epic battle with the man himself, Dracula. 

IN REALITY: Hours of frustration trying to even find the bread crumb trail only to end up eating crap. Then when the Hunters finally find Drac he flutters away in the night like a fart in the wind never to be seen again! Or battle after battle in total frustration. In the end it's true to its theme it's horrible, blood thirsty, gypsy aristocratic vampire ass self...and that's why I respect it.

An excellent hidden movement game. Heavily thematic, yet the base mechanics plus the strategy of deducing Dracula's location is fantastic and keeps me interested on an actual mechanics level. First few games made me concerned about the balance between hunters vs Dracula but more plays has lead to an evening out in the skills of the hunters vs Dracula and games have been very tense since then. Only downside to this game is that it can occasionally drag on a bit too long, especially if you have some slower players.

Not a universal hit; some people are going to have a problem with potentially long stretches without a lead.  On the flipside of that, being Dracula can be extremely stressful and difficult.

Still, when it works, it's excellent.

RATING: 4
This new edition is breathtakingly beautiful and thematic.
However, the gameplay makes the fatal mistake of combining slow, methodical decision making with a shuffled deck of cards that are all either contextually useless or game-endingly powerful.   
This means that multiple turns of intricate planning often go to waste due to a single unfortunate draw, and 4-5 hour game sessions routinely anti-climax in the deck making it impossible for one or the other side to win.

Some thing in this new edition makes more sense, and some of it makes less.  Still have to see what the game is like from Dracula's perspective before I totally make up my mind.  I find the outcry over the production quality of the rulebooks and playtesting to be valid.  There is very little excuse to rush the rulebook through nor for different parts of the rulebook to seemingly contradict each other.  In a game of this cost, and being the third edition of the game, there is little excuse for not having a clear and well editied document for a rulebook.

Great hidden movement game and dripping with theme.  Very true to the book, too.  Only drawback is it can take some time to play, unless the hunters score a quick knockout on Dracula.

Very strong theme in this hidden movement, one versus all game. The hunters can be OP when they communicate well but Dracula can be nasty with the cards placed on the locations he's been to (not so much in combat, however). Combat being based on cards means the only way luck is involved in the game is if you draw too many of the same types. The game does play slowly and takes awhile tom complete despite a relatively simple setup. Art and style of the game is well done and fitting to the theme. Would see more plays if it didn't take so long to get through a game.

An excellent game that "screams" theme and deductive strategy. Well worth the time it takes to get comfortable with the clever mechanics and card play. The third edition hits the sweet spot for  a challenging  multi-player game that will leave your brain burning just enough to keep you coming back for more.  Permanent in my collection and now out of print--a keeper.

RATING: 6
A fun theme with a few great opportunities for clever deduction that is takes way too long and tends to drag out after Dracula makes his third impossible escape, thus restarting the hunt all over again. Too often this feels like Dracula has no teeth and simply running away from the much stronger humans. Not much fury to be seen. This might have gotten a higher rating if there weren't a few  much better hidden movement games giving almost the exact same experience in half the time.

Fury of Dracula is a great 1 v X.

It is a tad bit "heavy" for many gamers. I think game works at all levels. It can be boring for Dracula because his downtime can be long.

RATING: 8
Solid game with some downtime issues.  We played with 5 players, so it was the max player count.  However, I doubt the time between turns changes much based on number of players as you always play with all 4 hunters divided amongst the players and each hunter (not player) gets 2 actions before the Dracula players takes their 2 actions.  We had great table talk and banter, so the downtime wasn't interminable.  Otherwise, the decisions are interesting to make and the relative power between the two sides is well balanced (Dracula will destroy an unprepared solo hunter, but a couple hunters with a couple items can take him down).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The core deduction element of the game is too boring. It's a simplistic chore to have to keep calculating what spaces on the map are most likely to contain the hidden Dracula. And, as it's a semi-co-op game, ironically you'll probably find one player taking over 90% of that.

Beyond that, you just wait until it's finally your turn, then do some minimal movement on the map and resolve a flipped card or two. We played it today and one player had literally no individual actions to do for over an hour, so kept passing. Then he got hit by a 'fog' that made him miss his next two turns! My last three turns were spent slowly moving my character from one sea to the next, without having to draw, resolve or do anything else.

It feels like a direct combination of Eldritch Horror and Letters From Whitechapel. But I like it less than either. Eldritch Horror does at least have a huge diversity of cards that can have novel combinations and spring big surprises. Letters From Whitechapel avoids all the boring card-drawing and let's players focus on trapping the enemy on the map, which I recall was done slightly more interestingly than in Fury of Dracula.

I've only played Fury of Dracula once, so won't score it yet. But the other players had all played it more than once and all (except maybe one) like it more than I do. I am wrestling with the idea that I just don't like (semi) co-ops, so it may just be me. To me, most (semi) co-ops feel a lot like the above.

This game is pretty solid in my group right now. If we want heavy Specter Ops, we go with this. The theme is great! The combat is great! Its all around just great. I heard previous versions used dice roll for combat, which after playing this version would make me sad! The game is solid. It does take about 3 hours, but its a quick 3 hours. I would also recommend playing with 5 as playing multiple hunters is not as fun. Its nice to focus on your own cards and role.

RATING: 6
Played this game and I found it to be slow and boring. And if the Dracula player is any good it is almost impossible to win as the investigators. Dracula will just keep bouncing around the board every 6 turns and unless you can somehow get 2 investigators on him you may get a chance to kill him. If asked to play this game I may but I will never suggest it.

So. Much. Fun. When we play, the player playing Dracula feels genuinely persecuted while the others catch a legitimate hunting fever. The only other game with such a genuine motivation to me is Pandemic. I love playing Dracula and fooling my persecutors - there are so many possibilities. For example, they knew I had to be on one of two Oceans and blocked some ports. I wasted the power that lets you skip a city despite landing in a completely free place. Worked a charm. I love this game so much!

One play and it replaced Letters From Whitechapel. 
Very thematic and a very good implementation of hidden movement combined with combat, adventure and much more.

It can seem complicated, but it all connects very well.

As opposed to other hidden movement games it's more than just "get the guy". If Dracula beats the shit out of you enough times, you're done.

Easily in my top 5 favorites at the moment.

Turns play quickly and even though the game plays a bit long (probably my only criticism) it never feels like it's overstaying its welcome. You're always engaged in what's going on and it's got a great tension to it.

Plays great with 3 and 5 players, but I feel it's a bit finicky with 4 and I wouldn't play it with 2. Fantastic game.

Got hosed as Dracula in the base/starter game. If the hunters don't draw event cards at night you are literally just moving around and doing not much else. Wouldn't play with out Dracula's full suite of powers again even with new players. Overall high quality components, a so-so rule book and great artwork. Would like to play again with full powers and play as hunters. It was def too easy for hunters on starter game.

I loved the second edition of Fury of Dracula, but against my expectations Fantasy Flight found a way to get rid of the weaknesses of that game and reinforce what made it great in the first place. The third edition is definitive, and it cements Fury of Dracula as one of the best narrative experiences in the hobby. All of the atmosphere, the quiet tension, those bursts of activity when players scramble to follow a hot trail, they all combine into something truly special.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
This and Letters From Whitechapel are the two big hidden-movement games that I've played.  The extra mechanical and thematic elements to Fury of Dracula, though they may make the game less "pure" as a competitive deduction game than LFW, seemed to make the game more interesting and fun overall.

The game is fun (though decidedly more fun, IMO, if you're Dracula), thematic, and keeps players engaged in the chase or the flight.  As a Hunter, I do find the game can begin to drag a bit as it goes on into multiple hours of playtime.  I think we tend to play rather slowly, which we should improve as we play the game more, but regardless I feel it is just not as interesting or engaging to chase after the trail of the Dracula player as it is to create the trail yourself and feel the pressure to outsmart the Hunters when playing Dracula.

This game is awesome. The third edition took everything that was wrong in the second (dices, combat full of boring stalemates and dead ends, overpowered and swingy events) and set it right. No more teleportation, no more dodge vs dodge or win a throw and nothing happens because wrong item or the like, no more Dracula being revealed because of a lucky throw. The hidden movement component of the game has been exalted: now the hunters need to be wary of every movement and every lead, they can't just hope to pop the right card at the right moment to do the job for them. More to the point, the game is now on a clock, and while a lot of players does not seems to like that, it definetely make sense, both to limit the duration of the game and to give a necessary sense or urgency. Dracula is back and can finally play for keeps, let's get to him :D!

Slow-developing and not necessarily tense at any point. Just blah despite nice trappings--great for groups who like slow, frustrating, anti-climactic games. Makes me yearn for the simplicity of Scotland Yard, another game I don't find so hot. Second edition art seems overall better to me.

Really love this game. It can get very tense if the Dracula player is good. I've never played the previous editions, but this one seems pretty solid and well balanced. I enjoy the "rock, paper, scissors" with cards combat. Makes such encounters feel like a major battle of wits and intuition.

This is the first time I've played a FFG reimplementation and thought that they got pretty much everything right, but it may still be a game that isn't really worth the time investment - though that may just be that I played 1st edition enough not to have much mileage left in this in spite of the improvements. Worth playing from time to time, better with fewer players, most fun of course for Drac.

RATING: 5
Originally rated an 8, downgraded to a 6.  This game is immensely fun for Dracula, and fun overall for a few of the hunters, but at least one hunter always seems to get skunked.  They move around the board collecting items and looking for the enemy, and may successfully herd him one way or another and contribute to a team victory.  But along they way, that person never actually got to DO anything.  No combat, no tense moments, no excitement.  I've played it 5 times in total and every time someone has ended up like this.  Not a great gameplay design in a 1vMany game if the best strategy is to make everyone else not have fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've only played this once so far and the game dragged on a bit too long. There are too many opportunities for the Dracula character to "hit restart" on the game - causing all of the player's work to become undone. I think a simple turn-counter mechanic (better than the one that is currently in the game - unless we were using it wrong - which we might have) would help this game reach a conclusion quicker. There is no reason why this should be a six-hour game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent and really enjoyable game, but also quite fiddly and takes forever to play. Once you get the hang of the base mechanics, it flows smoothly enough, so it's not a tedious game, really, but there's still just so much to be done that it takes a very long time to play anyway. The "120-180 minutes" listed here might actually be a LOW estimate.

It definitely shows its age even in this updated edition, with all the fiddly little one-off mechanical rules and everything. But the core of the game-- Dracula sneaking around Europe and the players trying to hunt him down by sniffing out his trail-- is really quite fun. And the very fiddliness I complain about means there's all sorts of interesting little one-off mechanics that throw a monkey wrench in the plans of one side or the other.

I feel like it's best approached mentally as one might approach a CCG-- it's a relatively simple game with rules that aren't too hard to understand, but in which almost every card and thing in the game is somehow an exception to one or more of those rules, ramping up the complexity significantly.

[1 play] I've played previous editions several times. 3rd edition is the most refined and the most fun. Combat is cleaned up. Both Dracula and the hunters have cards to keep either side from getting an insurmountable advantage. The clock ensures that the game will end in about 3 weeks if not before.

The artwork, the component quality, and the atmosphere the game generates all come together for a very memorable experience.

This is a fantastic game!  I'll admit (sadly) that it only comes out during the holidays for us.  I should be playing it every month!  It's long and takes a while to explain, but easy to play afterwards.   The person playing Dracula will be sitting around for a while waiting on others to take their day and night turns, but if you immerse yourself in the game and plan out your movements, you won't notice it.

This game is most definitely an acquired taste. Playing as Dracula is much more fun and comes naturally. Playing the hunters can be boring at times and it takes some luck to grab Dracula's trail. Still the game isn't as imbalanced as I originally thought it was it just takes some experience to learn how to play the hunters properly. Good game, but in no sense a great one.

For my comments on the game in general, see Fury of Dracula Second Edition.

My opinions on the update (first impressions):

* Revamped train ticket system I really dislike. Takes all the tension out of the movement in the first game and replaces it with something really boring.

* Removal of die from combat seems OK. I'm fine with the combat die but since the game isn't really primarily about combat anyway I think this is reasonable. 3rd edition actually seems more about combat than 2nd, so maybe reducing luck was important for that reason. At any rate, combat system probably better overall, and hunters are actually rewarded more heavily for group combat which is intuitive and good change.

* Lots of flavor rules adjusted to make the game simpler, but also don't sit well with me:

-Stake went from being best weapon to no longer doing anything at all VS Dracula... but a Punch can now hurt him? OK?

-There are multiple types of Vampires, which seems great at first, but some are functionally identical but better versions of each other?? Like reckless Vampire > Aristocratic Vampire. Different Vampires to make up for lack of Minions is a great idea, but wasted potential here. The Vampire differences are boring.

* Day/Night system got clunkier I think. Dracula only attacks during thje day? Hunters only find Dracula at night? OK...

* The accelerated end game feels kinda forced. Doesn't really feel like a natural end, just that the game's over because the game said so. This is probably in line with FFG's recent attempts to put a more "acceptable" upper limit on length for their longer games, but as usual, it cheapens the overall epic experience in some games that had a great arc that is cut too short.

Overall I prefer the 2nd edition, because none of 3rd editions improvements really jump out at me as changes I really wish were in the 2nd edition. And on top of that, 3rd edition introduces some changes that I don't like. Opinion subject to change, of course, as I'm sure I haven't recognized all of the subtleties of 3rd edition's design.

Either way, this is a great game.

Great strategy game and far superior to Letters to Whitechapel IMHO  which I found to be a little too easy to win as the hunters.
  Played as 3 and 5 player games so far with everyone wanting more,
  Getting loads of play now with several friends buying their own copy.
I have had to revise my score down a little as we are hitting a few problems now that we are all very experienced, the problem is that Drac is almost impossible to beat with the extra cards which make him overpowered so we are currently experimenting to work out which of Dracs 6 advanced cards need to be removed, certainly "Wolf Form" needs to come out and maybe "Feed".
Hopefully we can get the balance so that the wins are fairly even or realistic but at the moment Drac has won the last 10 games but without any of his advanced cards it favours the hunters far too much.

This is an intriguing hidden movement game that you can really sink your teeth into.  Both tense and tactical, both Dracula and the hunters have lots of fun choices to make.  Art and components are beautifully eerie and evoke a classic horror theme.

I love thematic games with a social aspect and I don't mind a bit of luck if it creates an unpredictable narrative. If you like Battlestar Galactica or tabletop roleplaying games, you will love this game. It is not for hardcore Eurogamers expecting a perfectly balanced game with chess-like tactical precision and very little luck, though. The Dracula, especially, is not really "doing" much in terms of game mechanics for large portions of the game; rather he/she is just listening to table talk and trying to out-guess the hunters.

Played once, hunters won because Dracula used a train which is forbidden.
+ beautiful design and components
- way too long for what it is
- some Dracula cards are really strong, he can escape too easily
- on the other hand hunters move slowly (I was stucked in a far away hospital, it took a week -1/3 of the game- to catch up the others on the map)
- player decisions are quite limited
All in all, hidden movement games are not my favourite.

Picked up after playing a game of it at BGG Con 2017. 

After 2 plays of being Dracula I'm not totally sure how balance the game is. One of the games they found me on the second day and I was never able to escape. (I refused to use Sea spaces or Wolf form).  Despite them knowing where I was the whole time I still won pretty easily. Players expressed disappointment in the fact that they never had anything good to fight me with. 

I think with future plays this will work itself out. I think my success came down to winning most of the rock/paper/scissors combat. Really looking forward to getting a chance to play as the hunters. 

Also if you are looking for decent priced copy, look for them at Barnes and Noble, I got my copy for $43. This was with a 10% membership discount and a 20% discount code from an email.

Obsoletes Letters from Whitechapel? I hate to say that but in LfW Jack just runs. In FoD, Dracula also runs BUT he can leave traps! More importantly he can HUNT and fight as well! Some say its too easy for him to get away late game by going out to sea. I have yet to play enough games to see if that is true but I look forward to my next gaming session with this gem. I passed up getting the LfW expansion and I'm not sorry about that.

Great thematic game. Love the artwork, the components and the game board. The mechanics of hidden movement for one and investigation for the other work really well here and the challenge lies not only in the locating of Dracula, but the combat as well which is a rock, paper, scissors style minigame. This game however only works with 5 players, as any less and people have to double up on roles, and the actions become quite overwhelming. All roles feel unique and are fun. Definitely recommend for players looking for a 1 against all type game with a great theme.

tl;dr: a game of cancelling the other player's actions.

So yeah, this is not my typical kind of game, but I'm always willing to try new stuff. I'm not a fan of the many-against-one thing, but I don't hate it either. Finding where a hidden opponents is located on the board is always a fun challenge. So it's a bit of a mixed bag for me, but what my biggest problem with the game was, was the combat system. It's the fact that 50% of the time your action consists of cancelling the other player's action. This goes in both directions. This is not limited to the combat phase, but that's where it happens the most of course. And spending turns and turns cancelling the other players actions and having yours cancelled is not exactly thrilling for me. Making progress is certainly more enjoyable than blocking someone else's progress.
In the end I see what people like about this game, but I think there certainly are better games in this genre. Like [thing=155624][/thing].

Two plays remind me of the feeling I got the first time I played this one, 20+ years back: It all depends on the length of the game, because there are times when you would prefer be stabbed with a knife. Thematically seems very good, but then odd things happen, the chase goes on and on, and after four hours playing with little options you may feel like you'd be somewhere else.

I don't see myself trying again, frankly.

The combat adds some spice! I like the Rock-Paper-Scissors style combat cards that seems to fit into the flavor.

very expensive

There could be a bit more action outside of combat.
And it seems odd when Dracula wins by influence but there is not much vampire stuff on the board.

Simply a blast for me - if I have the time to spare. I would never again want to play this with 5 players, though - it is just boring for the single hunters. 2 or 3 players seem ideal for my (bloody) taste. Playing Dracula is heavily immersive, playing 2 or 4 heroes to hunt down the count in the most remote places across Europe can also be a very satisfying experience. One of those games that make stories to remember.

Where to start? Nearly impossible to win for the hunters. Over complicated rules that constantly disturb the game flow. A timer that does not stop when Dracula is at sea and can therefore not be attacked by the hunters and allows him to win the game without risk in the late stage of the game.  Hunters are very slow. Most of the cards from the earlier editions which allowed them to move more than one city have been scrapped. Etc, etc....
While the second Edition of this game is still a perfect 10 this 3rd Edition is a total disaster.

RATING: 8
I haven't played the previous editions, but this one is really fun.

Other games in this genre are usually all about the deduction of trying to find the right location. In this game even after you find Dracula you still have to fight him to the death using the unique battle system, before he escapes.

Really liking it so far, will have to see how it holds up after more games.

Took a while to convince my friends to play it, but I LOVED this game.  Kind of a pain to get set up, but once you get going it's a phenomenal game of cat-and-mouse. I played Dracula, and there were times when I felt like an unstoppable Lord Of Darkness, and there were times when the Hunters were right on top of me and internally I was going "ohshitohshitohshitI'mgonnadie". The Hunters did a great job chasing me all over Europe, but I was able to elude them long enough to fill up the Despair symbol and move my victory track to the dreaded 13. GREAT game!

This game is about the buildup. It can seem pretty slowly paced at the beginning, because aside from communicating with your counterparts, there is very little in the way of action in the game--that is--until you cross paths with Dracula for the first time. That's when things finally start to get interesting. Visually, the game is beautiful. One of the coolest looking boards I've seen. I love the artwork.

A great thematic game with elements I really enjoy.  The one-vs-many co-op aspect is a lot of fun as the investigators try to find Dracula while he tries to stay hidden and still wreak havoc.  I enjoy the hidden movement/location mechanic and the variable player powers/items.  It's a little long/involved for my family so it's not going to see a ton of play time but I'm glad to have it in my collection and hope to get it to the table at least once in a while.

THE most beautiful game board I've ever seen. Top to bottom, this game just looks amazing. 

My big gripe, after a single playthrough, is that your turns as hunters are really boring if you aren't hot on Dracula's trail. Draw a card, move one space, or draw one train ticket. Very few opportunities for interesting decisions.

Then things get super hectic and you blow everything and you die and you're back to square one and it's three hours later and the game's almost over.

I'd prefer a hidden movement game with more interesting decisions and that plays in half the time.

About [thing=181279][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=181279][/thing], in spite of the name might induce one to think, means more that Dracula is furiously fleeing and planting his vampire seed everywhere he can, sprinkling some places with bats, wolves, fog and the sort - Dracula is the base in which every vampire trope was built on, after all.

It is the hunters job to fight the servants of Dracula, trying to prevent his influence to take over Europe, and, at the same time, tracking the path of the monster itself in order to put and end to his profane life. All of this while working as best as possible around Europe's railway system, which can suck hard in that time.

Dracula have a lot of tools to use in his vampiring spree, but so do the hunters, mostly because they are specially good in finding the proper people to talk and the right places to be, as they can unveil the path of Dracula simply by arriving in a place, no matter how big and populated it is. They have the power of script, which can make even the most improbable things happen, often even.

All of this couple together to make a beautiful game, one that is tense, thoughtful, putting the two sides in a constant battle of wits, with Dracula trying to circle around and away of the hunters, leading them to some wild goose chases, while also spreading his influence and traps on his path; and the hunters looking to triangulate Dracula's moves, his possible hideouts, antecipate his movements, destroy his servants and kill the master vampire himself.

This is what [thing=181279][/thing] is. And without Keanu Reeves.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Most basically the turn is:
Hunters - each Hunter, in order:
- One Day action (movement, rest, supply, trade, get a train ticket and search).

Hunters - each Hunter, in order:
- One Night action (rest, supply, trade, get a train ticket and search).

There is no movement at night. Supply also works differently: if made during the day, the player takes the top card of the Event deck, knowing if it is a Dracula card or a Hunter card. If it is a Dracula card, it is discarded. During the night, the Event card is drawn from the bottom of the deck, and if it is a Dracula card, is goes to Dracula.

When moving or searching, a combat may occur. Dracula plays for himself and his servants. Combat lasts a maximum of 6 rounds, and can end sooner if one side was able to flee or one side is defeated.

Then is Dracula's turn, and he basically only picks a place to go (choosing a city card to put on the track) and may put an encounter card above it.

The turn then passes again to the Hunters.

The game ends when Dracula is killed (Hunters win) or when Dracula reaches 13 influence (Dracula wins).

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Lots. But the most often, for both sides, will be: to which place to move. This is the key part for Dracula to remain hidden and being able to mature its plots and gain influence. And is key for the Hunters to find Dracula's trail, foil his plans and try to kill Dracula.

The second most important set of decisions are those that involve combat: which card to use or to hold, waiting for a better opportunity. This serves both as a delay tatic, as one side just want to receive the least amount of damage as possible, or as a more violent approach, in order to avoid the cancelation of cards, to strike blows and cause damage/effects.

The third set of decisions stays around the use of Event cards, for both sides, and which Encounter card to place, for Dracula. This is important, specially for Dracula, and can have strong effects in the game, but, still, as a decision, it stays behind movement and combat, as often the use of them is either immediate or evident.

There are other decisions to be made, but these are the most relevant.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very thematic, serving truly as a cat and mouse chase, in which the mouse can strike back, and hard;
- Beautiful design and graphics;
- Great changes (from last edition) for the use of trains and combat;
- Constant cooperation between the Hunters players in order to decide movements and to unveil Dracula's path;
- While not much elegant in its mechanics, its flow is good and the amount of rules is rather slim for a game of this "size".

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- It can last for 3 hours or more of playing time;
- Is always required to play with all the 4 Hunters, regardless of number of players;
- While luck was lowered in this edition, it still has a fine part on the gameplay;
- Though the game has a small set of rules, some timming issues can arise easily.
- The person playing Dracula (probably the owner) will likely play him time and time again.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]

[b]Lord Godalming[/b] - Hamburg, february 3rd, 1898

[i]Mr. Seward, Dracula surely returned to Europe through here, in the small hours of the 2nd, coming in the Dame of the Night. I got here not even sixteen hours late! Damn all this snow! I talked with the coachmen and all of them remember last night well, because one of them had his carriage stolen. The coachman, a man named Hans, was hurt, but survived, which gives more proof to back what Mrs. Harker said: Dracula is weak. I will go to Berlin, for I also have a belief - that the vampire will go east, back to the region where he feels safer and has more power. We must block his way! I pray that you take the first train to Prague, and if the vampire isn't there, at least we will meet. I will leave tomorrow, when the ship that brings Mrs. Harker is expected to arrive. We will go together to Berlin, than, if necessary, to Prague. Ah, yes, I must also say that I don't have anymore of those night shudders - so I guess the concoction completed its job at last, even the bite marks are almost gone from sight. Thanks Mr. Helsing for me, for I'm not being able to reach him in a while.[/i]

***********

[b]Doctor Seward[/b] - Prague, february 5th, 1898

[i]Dracula was here, Lord Godalming! But again he slipped my grasp. Every time the trap appears to be set, the hare skips from it. Facing it at night wasn't one of my best ideas, but I feared that, by morning, he would have gone somewhere that I couldn't find. I kept him under my watch for two days, then I saw that he was making arrangements to leave. So I went to talk with the coachman when the was taking Dracula's luggage out. He attacked me as if he was mad, pulling out a knife and a pistol, but I pull the trigger of my rifle faster. During this unexpected fight, Dracula escaped in the form of a wolf, leaving all his belongings behind - I checked them in a hurry: it was all news things, probably purchased after he got back to Europe. I couldn't search for more, as the police was coming and a dead man would be a tough thing to explain. Come quick, my friends! I will be waiting in the Continental Hotel, room 16.[/i]

***********

[b]Van Helsing[/b] - Edinburgh, february 7th, 1898

[i]Friends, I'm basically stuck in here. I was delayed many times by servants of the vampire - enthralled by the power of the monster -, both humans and beasts. The demon took his time to do this while he was hiding from me and Mina. I had to return to Edinburgh because a violent storm wrecked both ships and the ports in the south coast. I suspect that more than a finger of foul sorcery was at work in this event. I shall return to the mainland as soon as possible.[/i]

***********

[b]Mina Harker[/b] - Vienna, february 12th, 1898

[i]Mr. Helsing, we - Doctor Seward, Lord Godalming and I - are in Vienna, a place where Dracula went by in his way to Eastern Europe. For me is clear that he intends to return to his lair - the Castle Dracula. Lord Godalming wants to go there and break in with fire and blades. I think is a rather bold, and unwise, but we do need to keep Dracula on the move. If he finds a secure location to recover, all might be lost - and we are so close to defeat him! So we will go to Budapest and, then, to Klausenburg. I hope you can join us for the final leg of this hunt.[/i]

***********

[b]Lord Godalming[/b] - Klauserburg, february 17th, 1898

[i]Mr. Helsing, the chase is almost at its end, I feel this in my bones. Doctor Seward went to Galatz, so that we can close the escape routes for Dracula. We weren't able to make a deal with the locals in order for them to take us to the Castle Dracula, not even more money nor threats worked. Mrs. Harker said that, if in the next morning we fail again, we should buy a carriage or cart and handle it ourselves. It is not ideal, since neither of us know the ways here, and the tracks in the mountains are treacherous and dangerous, specially in the winter. But we might not have another option. Anyway, we don't hear from you since jan 22th. I guess you are in the sea, but wire us a message when you can. I pray that all is well with you.[/i]

***********

[b]Doctor Seward[/b] - Galatz, february 19th, 1898

[i]Mrs. Harker and Lord Godalming, I hear wolves last night and the people on the streets talked all morning about a lone rider, dressed in black and surrounded by mist, that crossed the town during the small hours of the night. The local folk have many stories to tell but little truth in the words. Even so, I will investigate further these rumors. Any news from Mr. Helsing?[/i]

***********

[b]Van Helsing[/b] - Constanta, february 22th, 1898

[i]Friends, forgive me! I was in a long voyage in the ship Sea Foam, coming all the way from Edinburgh to Athens. From Athens I took another ship - the Navigator - to reach Constanta. You messages came to me when we took port on the way here, rest assure. I knew - or hoped - that the vampire would, yet again, try to escape by the sea, crossing the Black Sea to Turkey. So I encourage the capitain of the Navigator to use all the coal he had so that I could arrive sooner. I had with me a pair of bloodhounds, that I bought in Scotland. They are fierce and loyal, and I trained them to search for the smell of the vampire - not an easy task, since the dogs, for a good while, tried to run away from the smell. It must be said, my friends, that sometimes, seldom, sure, but sometimes luck smile for a person. Why, you ask? Well, because, while I was taking my belongings out of the Navigator, my dogs started to bark in a wild manner. I had to let them go, because they would suffocate or break the leashes. The dogs sprinted away and I went behind them. And then, lo and behold, the dogs were following the vampire! The demon was making arrangements for his transportation when the dogs attacked. He hissed and call for a wave of rats to attack us, and the rodents appeared from everywhere, but the dogs kept most of them away, for time enough for me to take on the vampire himself. He tried to flee again, but not this time! I don't know exactly how, but as we rolled on the ground, my stake found its way to the beast black heart. The demon contorted his body in impossible ways, kind like a worm when taken out of the ground, and soon there wasn't nothing there - nothing more than a heap of clothes. My frieds, we freed the world from this curse! A new day rises![/i]

This is what player should feel while playing. Some won't, sadly, seeing only a set mechanisms active as clockwork. But some will, and it will be great.

Anyway, [thing=181279][/thing] made some good changes, particularly in some parts, and two of them being ones I truly wanted: movement by trains and combat.

For the combat, before it was all on the dice. No matter how great the hunt was, nor how well Dracula has used his powers and servants to hide and escape, but once a hunter and Dracula are in the same place, all came to the dice. Roll poorly and you will lose, get bitten, die or Dracula will escape, no matter how great your hand is. I knew the combat could be so much better, but inspite being somewhat novel (with its many relations between the cards used and its effects), I found it to be lackluster and disappointing - considering all the movement strategy that the game requires previous to the encounter. Now, they get rid of the dice and left only the cards, adding symbols - when two symbols colide (being present on Dracula's and the Hunter's card), Dracula's card is cancelled. If not Dracula's card goes first. Simple and effective. Dracula's attacks and of his minions is also tougher to predict.

For movement, before you had to roll while using trains. Now you take ticktes to use later. The tickets have values going from 1 to 3, and can't all be used anywhere (there are a 1 white, which can only be used in West Europe, for instance). But the movement you get is definitive: you can count on it when you want to use it (sure, Dracula has some Events that mess with the tickets, however, it is a person doing it, not a die), therefore you can strategize your turn, and with the others, in order to reach places, planning is stronger now.

There were also changes to the Encounters that Dracula's put in his hideouts - making them, usually, better to be used, as now they all have effects when matured. The use of some Event cards were changed in order to contain more options and become useful in more situations. Dracula can also gain points easier and in more ways, which is very good.

In the end, [thing=181279][/thing] is simply a superior game than its predecessor, as all the noticeable changes were for better, while still keeping the same feeling, thrills and excitement of its former self. Therefore, although i liked the 2nd edition, I always kept a resistence to it, since I often get myself frustrated with the dice in what was, in other parts, a very strategic and controlled game. This was left in the past, and I can recommend the 3rd edition fully.

Playing as a hunter is just frustrating with the game divided into a day action and a night action, during the day you can move take tickets and get cards but most of the time your night action is just useless because you can't move during the night, getting cards is extremely risky and that only leaves you with the action of getting train tickets at night. Every time I have played this game and Dracula has lost it has been because of a dumb mistake like Dracula trying to swim to shore when the space had no port. This game is also only playable with 5 people as you must have 4 hunters and Dracula. Its not fun watching another person double up and getting stuck with only one hunter.

I'm giving this an 8 for now until I get a few playthroughs. What I will say is this; the rules are generally intuitive, but there is a lot to remember with some special cases here and there. The amount of synergistic content to pour through means that more experienced players will have a huge upper hand. I ran as Dracula my first time. My players felt a little lost at first, but their moods changed immediately when they caught my trail. A great end-game experience worth the 2-3 hours.

It lived up to the hype.  I never played the earlier editions, but this one works great.  Possibly a bit too long and can drag on more than you like when you think you finally have Dracula and he gets away again.  Still it's fantastic fun as you travel around the map hoping to run into his path, gearing up your guy and taking on Vampires and Dracula first hand.

My big gripe is when playing a hunter you may end up on the opposite side of the map than all the action and spend a quarter of the game catching up only to run into a trap that delays you for another 2 or 3 turns.  If you're just controlling one character, it can feel like you're out of the game for quite a while.

Dracula uses a deck of location cards to secretly travel through Europe, leaving a trail of encounters and events for the hunters that chase him. Meanwhile, the hunters attempt to track and destroy Dracula using the limited information available to them. The hunters must destroy Dracula before he earns enough victory points to win the game.

Currently one of my favorite games right now. I love the hidden aspect to the game; dracula moves each round yet no body but himself knows where he is moving. The only thing that prevents me from rating this a perfect 10 is that the length of the game is a little long (5 hours on our first play through) and thus it is hard to find a good time to get this on the table. In addition, of my current collection, this probably has the most convoluted rules to follow and thus it becomes a hard game to pull out especially if you have a group who has never played it before.

Played twice. Both times one member of the hunter team really didn't enjoy themselves due to another member of the hunter team. This is a design issue. A game that is strategically 1vs1, is mechanically 1vs4. Also turns lots of turns where you don't do anything, become 'delayed' (i.e. Miss a go), and end game is incredible drag. Although this won't always be the case, in both games I played the result was obvious long before the game finished. 
In summary, 4 players ensuring one other person has a good time does not equal fun.

One player takes the role of Dracula while up to four others attempt to stop him by controlling Vampire hunters.
Dracula secretly travel through Europe, leaving a trail of encounters and events for the hunters that chase him.

I'm a sucker for the classic "Universal" monsters. Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf-Man, the Mummy and, of course, Dracula. So, then I hear that there's this game where one player gets to be Dracula? And everyone else is attempting to drive a stake through his heart? Sign me up!

But before we go any further, let's get one thing out of the way right now: this game can be long. And not just that...sometimes this game can feel long, which is far worse a fate for a board game.

But if you get the right dynamic going, with an aggressive Dracula and a smart group of hunters, the game creates a remarkable atmosphere. Sinister, oppressive, mysterious...dangerous! As time passes, the hunters become better equipped, but the longer they let Dracula traipse about Europe, the closer he gets to completing his plans. The game feels simultaneously tense for both sides. Dracula doesn't want to be discovered until he's ready to attack. The hunters can never be quite sure whether they've got him running scared, or if they're about to stumble right into his trap.

I wouldn't mind it being a bit shorter, but the time flies quickly when we play it. It is very strategic, with a lot of interesting decisions and bluffing for both sides, and, most importantly, the thrill of the hunt is there. Some card may appear to be swingy, but hey, it's up to the hunters whether they are introduced to the game.

Even though I won't play it often due to the playing time, I am already looking forward for the next time it gets to the table. Recommended!

Too bad about lack of expansions. While the game is really replayable, I wouldn't mind seeing different hunters. Actually, that is the only expansion I would add as the core game is a complete product.

RATING: 8
Notice: only played as Dracula (twice) as of yet, might adjust the 8 later as some friends claimed it was less exciting as Hunter.

I was a bit in doubt when I first heard about this game. I've played Scotland Yard as a kid, and I liked, but never loved that game. This one is much deeper, has much more choices - and thus strategy (although Hunters said it's a bit aimless at the beginning because you don't have any trail yet). I felt it was balanced (although I lost twice as Dracula ... but I did make a big mistake first time, and second time I had to help the hunters bc they were new).

All in all, I really love the depth and balance, but you have to keep in mind that it's not a light game like Scotland Yard.

A streamlined version of eralier fud wich i have not played. This is a hidden movement game where one hides and the others tries to figure out where on the map the hidden player is. Very lenghty and a set player count. If you play with fewer than five some need to control multiple char. Very long.

RATING: 9
Game can drag super hard when you first start playing. We ended up going four hours due to having to look up rules a number of times as they were not entirely clear or obvious in the book. Some parts of the manual are not intuitively located but are easy enough to find online and you will be pointed to the right part of the manual. 

The game itself is wonderful and a fun game. It's pretty hard for both parties as Dracula even if you outplay them at various points will feel hunted pretty quickly if they find you, and teh hunters have to deal with a lot of issues to catch up. 

Some parts are necessary but can make it very frustration, such as wolf form. Using it does allow Dracula a fair amount of flexibility in playstyle but for hunters it can cheat them out of a trapped dracula. I got away once when surrounded by 3 people and guessed where they would assume I would go. 

Overall, great game.

I absolutely love it. The board is gorgeous, very true to the gothic horror atmosphere. The gam stays true to the book,which is awesome.

Playing as both dracula or the investigators is a lot of fun, the game automatically develops a good suspense arc, first trying to figure out where dracula is, finding him, fighting him and then probably a mad chase to try to finish him off. 

It's a long game though, our games have lasted between 2 and 3 hours. Only downside.

Full disclosure: I played Letters from Whitechapel first. I found FoD to be quite frustrating at times because it's a constant "we have him and now he's 2 spaces away!" ... almost to the point of feeling helpless. Additionally, even if you do find him and you've only got the basic combat cards, you're going to have a bad time - and then he ends up 2 spaces away! Aside from that, it was mostly good. I love the setting, the design of the board, the fact that there's minis (even if they're kinda lame) instead of the pawns in LfW. I haven't even touched on my biggest complaint with FoD - the listed player count. The box says 2-5 but I will never play with anything less than 5 again. Managing 2 hands of cards doesn't work well, it would just be better if each hunter was 1 player. I can't imagine playing this with 2 where the hunter player would have to manage all 4. I prefer LfW at 2, but FoD is certainly the better choice at 5. Anything in between and I'm going to play something else.

RATING: 6
Borrowed this from a friend. I've not yet played a full game of this. But it's really fun so far. I would say the ideal number of players would be three. One to play Dracula, and two hunter-players. Each hunter-player would control 2 legendary vampire hunters each. I playtested/learned the game with just me and my brother and 4 hunters to one person seemed a bit much. A single hunter per player (in a 5-player game) seemed too limiting. Hunters get 2 actions per day and get to carry a limited number of items. Meanwhile, even though Dracula only gets a single action each day (nighttime phase), he gets a whole arsenal of timed traps that are waiting for an unsuspecting hunter. In addition, he has super powers and there are even events that might spring up and give him more opportunities to escape or defeat hunters. My one gripe is that there is no real quicker way to play. With everything Dracula sets out, on a 6-turn incubation period, it will be several turns before anything significant happens in favor of Dracula. And there aren't many ways to corner Dracula, so intensity of interactions never felt that dire to me. We played about 2.5 hours before calling it quits. It's definitely a fun game but I'm not sure I'd want to play any role other than Dracula in future sessions.

After my initial learning play I'd be more interested in this game with 3-5 players rather than as a 2 player game.
Upon trying this with 4 players the game really came alive though there are some rules ambiguities and we abandoned our play through despite enjoying it for a time. 

I need to print the FAQ for this one.

Had some good times with this one and since we don't own other games of this kind it's worth hanging on to even if we only play it once a year or so.

Neat game. I´ll probably write a review about it. There is a lot going on in this game and the team work required to take Dracula down is some of the best I have seen in games.

This is the cleanest design of the concept yet - I've played all 3 versions, and let me tell you FURY OF DRACULA 1st edition was one of my most cherished and well-played boardgames as a teenager.

However, as I get older and crankier, I also crave modern thinking, and this iteration might actually be the best and most accessible.

[b]“Come,' he said, 'come, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.”[/b]

1. The dice have gone.
2. All the cardboard chits have been swept away!
3. The chits have been replaced by cards - with the rules etched upon them. Obviously this saves anyone having to refer to the rules EVERY turn.
4. The box art on the SIDES is terrific (a geeky observation!).
5. The gameboard is bigger and more gothic.
6. The rules have added some wrinkles that I immediately approve of - for instance, the risk/reward of hunters drawing cards at night, etc.
7. I heartily applaud the event card's dual uses. Do I use this card now, and gain X, or do I wait and play it for Y?
8. Thematic experience game, resplendent with all the corny/great, vampire/Dracula lore you could wish for.
9. This version tracks Dracula's victory much more clearly than before. Originally, it was often the case whereby the game ended suddenly with Dracula declaring "I've won!" and the Hunters might not have known how far advanced his devilish plans were - this is not the case here now.
10. Hugely better overall experience, mainly through the trail that Dracula creates in his wake. The Hunters are nearly always hot on the vampire's heels. Counter to what we thought in the 80s, the more you are tipped off to Dracula's movements, but not completely in the know - the more enjoyable the game.
11. The 'teleportation' event cards have been removed. This is a blow to Dracula players, I guess, but it's a win for everyone else. Perceived unfairness, and other issues, denied [i]Fury of Dracula 2nd edition[/i] getting many plays around these parts. Modifications like this increase the relevance of skill and deduction, and artfully reduce the randomness of some of the Count's maneuverings.
12. The rock-paper-scissors combat has been massively overhauled.

[b]The Walpurgisnacht (Witches' Night)[/b]

1. The box art on the front is just awful.
2. The insert is useless. 2nd edition had the superior insert - plastic no less!
3. Some possible rules omissions - THESE MAY BE DELIBERATE! I think it would have been wise of them to include a short half-page at the back of the rulebook explaining what was changed and why.

Quite rules heavy, feels a bit clunky and slow. It's a cool game but I don't like it 2p, one player controlling 4 characters and one only one makes downtime very lopsided. I find myself rushing my turns as the investigators as a result.

Definitely lived up to the hype. Most of our group loved the game and are looking forward to playing it again in January. A very interesting take on cat-and-mouse.

RATING: 1
This game purports to be an interesting game of cat and mouse that devolves into an exercise of extreme tedium while the players run around working really hard to accomplish nothing.

Unless Dracula is played by an IQ 60 moron, the players will lose.  There's not even the pretense that they have a chance.  I would rather be slowly eaten alive by flesh-eating bacteria than play this game again.

If you like co-op waterboarding then by all means... play this pretense of a good game.  It's literally the least engaging, most frustrating thing I've ever experienced in 30+ years of gaming.  It's so offensive I'm stunned.

First impression is very good.
My first session was with 2 players: to get use to the mechanics of the game.

pluspoints:
- constant tension where Dracula might be
- the feeling of being hunted by 4 characters. 4 hunter-characters are always in play, even if you play with 2 players.
- I don't have the feeling the hunters or Dracula are overpowered.
- Dracula can't hide in a corner of the map, and is obliged to keep on moving => Dracula can only return to the same place after 7 moves.
- If you manage to keep avoiding your hunters, at a certain point you will gain extra influence (objective Dracula) for every passing night, and thus put the pressure on the hunters to find you, otherwise Dracula will get to the max 13 influence points and win the game.

downsides:
- when playing with 2 players. 1 player needs to control all the hunters, which might be overwhelming for a firsttimer :-)
- in comparison with the hunters, Dracula only moves and leaves encounter cards. The actions Dracula can do during his turn are a bit limited. Watching the hunters think about their strategy and trying to read your moves makes up for it.
- my first session was without any combat, which is weird... I got lucky, or I always managed to escape on time. I think this will not be the case on other sessions (played it for the first time, WITH a first-timer)
- Currently it has an 8/10. This game plays great with 2, but will shine with 4-5 players. I still need to playtest this.

neutral:
- I put this game in the same category as "Specter Ops", with that difference that the hunted (Dracula) can fight against the hunters, which isn't the case in "Specter Ops". Can't give any comparison to "Letters from Whitechappel)
- It is a lengthy game. We played for 3 hours and we had to end the game early on. (we had to go somewhere)
So take it into account

This is one of my favorite games of all time. It has just the right amount of logic and just the right amount of luck. I love being dracula, but I always lose. I'm better off as a hunter. Personally, it is a five person game, but I prefer it in a 2 person setting where one person plays all the hunters and one plays Dracula. It's still fun if you get the whole gang together and play. I own the game and never plan on giving it away.

Game with a great athmospere. Liked it very much after one play. We remarked that Dracula was very though and the hunters were far from winning the game. There were a lot of rule questions due to the poorly written learn to play book. 

After two overwhelmingly easy victories of Dracula I think the wolf form is a bit too overpowerd.

Fun hidden movement game that can be very tense. I have only played the basic game so far but even then with the "rock paper scissors" type combat that the hunters can catch up to Dracula fast with train tickets, it takes some brains and strategy to win as both. Great game with the same but different flavor other similar games.

An improvement over the previous edition.

Theme is through the roof in this one, and even though Fury of Dracula is about as long as I'd like to play a game (about 3 hours), I do think the immersive story and beautiful components help.

After five plays, I can say that this is now my go to deduction/hunt. The variation and randomness are just too much fun to ever play Whitechapel again. Alas.

I particularly liked how combat worked in this game though I didn't seem to have the right cards.   Love the hidden move aspect of the game.

One my favourites, although our group found catching Dracula very tough.

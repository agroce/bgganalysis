Classic Swedish game. It's actually very good as well I think. Sure there are some cards better than others and all that but as long as you enter the game knowing that it's not that big of a deal. It's fun, that's what counts.

Swedish game. Carddriven and chaotic, despite the firm structure. About swedish history where you act as a noble. Quite fun, but more of a family game, than a gamers game.

RATING: 9
This is a great game from swedish history and always fun to play. You and your friends have to both defend swedens expanding empire from the danes and russians but at the same time compete for power within the kingdom. It provides great tactical and fun gameplay. Good diplomacy and relations with other players may prove a curcial trait with the games many actioncards that your fellow players can choose to use against you. The game is played through 3 era's in the swedish line of kings and usually ends in a great climax at the end where everyone is doing there best to use their influence over the others and get ahead. 

It sure helps to be a swede when you play but this game would be great if converted to other languages aswell

Definatly a favourite

RATING: 7
A good game about the swedish history. Looks great and have various paths to victory. One set back is that it is somewhat unbalanced, one path is usually way better. But then, it is quite caotic, so anything could happen... If reworked a little it aspires for a 7 or 8.

Play as one of five historical noble families from Swedish history and try to get as much status points as possible in three centuries time. Focus on commerce, agriculture or culture & science, gain money and fiefs and defend Sweden during wartime againt foes like Denmark, Preussia, Russia and Poland. The player with the most status points at the end of the game is the winner.

One of the best examples of "event cards destroying a good game design" that I've ever seen. The problem is: without the damn cards the game is a big bore, but with them it is an exercixe in exquisite frustration. Avoid this game - believe me!

You should be three or maybe more to play this. I have played it on two and either you play nice or it is going to be one-on-one. Nothing wrong with competion, but that isn´t how the game is thought out to be. The players have to cooperate against foreign threat if anybody would be able to win. It usally degardes to destruction of assets instead of evolving the country as soupossed with few players.

RATING: 2
Very random one. Not necessarily a bad thing for a light game, but Svea Rike just doesn't work. The success seems to be determined by luck and a little stroke of bad variety can ruin the whole game. Not to mention the fact that backstabbing is far more common than in Diplomacy. I don't know if it's our play group, but the players don't have any chance of winning the game as they do not co-operate at all, but keep making life as difficult as possible for each other. Which is something I really do not enjoy. Nice looking game with an interesting idea watered down badly.

RATING: 7
This is a well designed and balanced limited action gamers' game with random event cards that make it a bit more "family-oriented" (but also too chaotic for me - but it gets much better if removing some of the "worst" cards). Don't be deceived by the categorization of the game as "civilization" and "war game" - these are misleading. There is a light "war-like" mechanism built into the game, but in it players fight a quick war (with cards) together and against an outside enemy (not against each other). Make no mistake about its basic eurogame design.

A fun game of screw your neighbors.  If not taken seriously, great game.  It is an odd old school euro- combination of randomness, overly simplified mechanics, and strong theming.  For this type of game, it overstays its welcome by about 30-45 minutes in my opinion.  If looked at purely as a screw your neighbor experience type game, it can shine.  I'd play it again but it isn't something I would ever consider purchasing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
To play, you probably do have to know about swedish history from the 16th century.
Nice feature is that the playing order in each of the 15(?) turns is randomized at the start of each turn.
Also a collosal set of cards that you can play at any time, thus killing opponents militaries, cultural personalities or to gain wealth, stop other cards or stop the current turn. And that's only the top of the iceberg.
The war sequence has been modified in later versions, because it's very simplified in the original. 
But overall, the game feels rather well-balanced, where the three ways to play (culture, agriculture and trade) has equal pros and cons.

I've got the Casper (1st) edition.

Wonderful game on Swedish history. Beautiful art, workable mechanics. Somewhat lacking in replay value, but usually comes out at least once a year. Well done!

UPDATE 100806: There really is a lot of screwage in this game, but that's all right with me :) You should probably house-rule the "manufakturier" card if playing w/real eurogamers, as 1-6 vp i quite a massive span. I suggest 1-3 or perhaps a fixed 3 (still very powerful). Also, no last-turn loans :)

Okay: Svea Rike is a very chaotic boardgame AND it's lucky-driven BUT there are also a lot of interactions between the players. In this game you really want to maximize your benefits and at the same time make your opponents life a little bit harder. That's why the game is chaotic and fun. A good game with the right people, but the game should be a shorter one... maybe? A great theme!

Played 5-10 times. I agree with other comments: a good game with beautiful components, but too chaotic. DonÂ´t analyse your moves too long; your castle will burn and your provinces revolt anyway. I like the wars, where players may choose to co-operate. If this were a game in English on a different part of history, e.g. German history, it would probably have been an international hit. This was a unique effort in the Swedish game industry in terms of theme, flavour and components.

RATING: 6
One of the most weird games I have ever played. While being the head of an aristocratic family trying to better your family's position in the realm, which is good, literally everything that ever went wrong in Sweden during historic times can occur to exactly just YOU in the space of one game turn! The king gets mad and reduces your feudal holdings, your favourite castle burns down, your sponsored great scientist Carl von Linné gets delirious and dies from the plague, as well as farmers riot, merchants gets kicked out from neighbouring countries, and you yourself gets accused of high treason, connection with foreign countries, dysfunctional farming, interest in manufacturing, and even worse, even democratic leanings... in one go! Take that, abandoned boy!!!

If anyone, not yet scared away by this comments, still wants to play the game, I can recommend it as a fun game, beautifully made, showing great art from the time period 1521 - 1813, and maybe, just maybe it can give some hints on Swedish history...

The game is fairly evocative of Swedish history, which is where it shines. Gameplay is very chaotic, with cards easily flying around the player's ears as each player piles upon the perceived leader. Since most information is open, it is fairly easy to see who is leading. A few too many cards are of the type that remove a player's victory points... in one situation, one player wiped out 6 victory points from two other players with one card play. This is a lot, when you consider that typical victory points totals range between 0-12. In short, it is fairly easy to drag back a leading player - probably too easy - and there is a fair amount of luck involved. Still, it is a fairly fast game (even with all beginners, a game can easily be finished in 3 hours), tends to have lots of action, and is fun within its limitations. Definitely a must-have for Swedes.

The game is much less appealing with three players but still enjoyable. You have to remove some of the cards from the game since they are totally unbalanced (i.e the 3 cards for 1, free turn with other activity, the two massdestruction cards). With those modifications, the game is nice in depth with several viable strategies.

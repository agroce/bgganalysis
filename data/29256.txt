Nice flow of the wooden pieces as they are used for many different aspects troughout the game. But overall it seems quite unfinished and a little bit to expensive for the components. The gameplay has some nice elements but the military decisions without luck makes it quite easy to disturb other players by a militaristic playstyle. It is interesting, that I could win the last game eventhough I got enslaved.

I bought this with American Megafauna and exapansions from Phil Eklund at Essen last year. Finally had a 2 player play through the rules today. Yes, we got some things wrong and my next task is to find a good player aid that reminds me how to do certain things (eg what governs hand size etc). But my first impression - this is a great experience and chock full of ideas. So really pleased (even if my Neanderthals seemed to do little else than draw catastrophe cards and make very European animal extinct). The whole thing has a kind of chaotic brillance and we laughed and laughed when it turned out that even the cows were too ferocious to be domesticated!

So, a very promising first attempt to play and I can't wait to sit down and play this properly.

UPDATE: Thanks to Rick Heli for including the player notes on his site - v helpful. Played again and starting to come together now - frustrating that you can have big swings from activity to inactivity as you move from prosperity to chaos but still a very good game! Want ot play w more than 2 players!

unplayed - another Sierra Madre game which appeals to me on the scientific angle but less so on the gameplay angle which I hear has similar problems as high Frontier in that luck can play a big detereminant of your game; luck would in reality play a big part so while it functions thematically, at the end of the day I want a game to be played strategically

First game, provisional view is a 9 rating. The mechanics take some while to learn and the rulebook works rather is very clear at explaining. The concepts need some time to sink in and then there is a desire to make progress. This means learning how the different engines in the game interact and how you overcome the game barriers to make quicker progress. But the urge to move forward in the game is strong and this is why the game is exciting to play.

The game has some neat ideas, but is unfinished, unbalanced, complicated, confusing and boring in roughly equal measures.  Production was clearly hurried, and it feels like a game that wasn't playtested thoroughly either.

It took about three plays and lots of research to figure out how to play this properly, but even in its rough original form I was loving it, and it only got better when we added the optional rules. It's random and frustrating, but I admire so much what this game is able to do. Through the Ages is the best game, but this is the best civ building experience.

RATING: 4
Three plays in and Origins is sinking fast in my estimation.  The initial attraction of the theme and mechanics has worn thin, revealing a game that is too dependent on luck of the die and the card draw.  Unlucky players can find themselves trapped in a small part of the globe and unable to keep pace with the others.  Another aspect that I heartily dislike is the revolution action which changes what you and perhaps an opponent score and can create huge swings in scoring immediately before the end of the game.  Three plays is not enough to pronounce on game balance, but there do appear to be issues, both with the relative strengths of the species and with the numbers of each type of public card.

Finally, after several plays with the same people and the release of the expansion, Origins has finally clicked.  Learning to walk the knife edge of a viable civilization without collapsing into deep, multi-turn chaos is but the first step of playing this game.

Played once as a 4-player game with the rules explained to me!  Unfortunately, too many early animals became extinct based entirely on poor die rolls.  The game stalled for some players with nothing to do.  They were stuck in small areas with extinct animals and thus no possible way to obtain energy, which is THE only way to advance in this civ building game.  So basically they had to wait until the next catastrophe provided passage through terrain roadblocks.  Other players were pretty much stuck also for I had an advantage in combat and slaughtered people at will.

Either we were playing with some key rules wrong or we played so badly that we dug ourselves into a hole.  In either case, I really do not enjoy the random extinction of animals.  This issue needs to be resolved.  Otherwise I will never play this game again!  I easily prefer Through the Ages instead of our failure at Origins.  The one redeeming quality of Origins is that the components look fantastic compared to Through the Ages.

RATING: 6
First play.

The mechanics of this game took some getting into. Being used to more straight forward rules it proved a hurdle to grasp what all the actions you could perform in a turn would actually do towards winning the game.

First plays are always hard and I would like to play it again. There did seem to be a lot of random moments however that I'm still a bit unsure about. In our four player game the climate changes/disasters really put a hindrance on some peoples placings like Africa when the desert became uninhabitable. Forming the "cities" and resources were collected in a system of chance as well which meant it was extremely hard to plan ahead and you could easily get stuck in your momentum spending several turns waiting for that one thing to happen before your species could move on.

All in all I still enjoyed the experience. It really was quite different from the other games I've played.

Have yet to lay this one on any group.
From the makers of High Frontier.

Is anthropology/human history civilization themed.
The expansion cards veer into ideology.
Listing various 20th century corporations on cards and talk about human freedom and limited government - which iS created by people, who came first, afterall. But the legal entity that is the corporation iS government as well. So this is essentially overlooked in the game creation. What..., with privileges such as limited liability doled out. People came before their legal creations - corporations, as well. It seems that legal privilege is confused with just being.
So there is definitely something overlooked here on the ideology side of this. But, it is...just a game.
So it is made to fit into game play.
Designer puts commentary in the rule book. I can put it here. Enjoy the game

RATING: 8.5
Flawed masterpiece, despite many reports that this is too luck based there is actually loads of room for skill. My biggest problem with the game is the severe difficulty in getting to 2 energy which acts as a roadblock to progression to Age IV. So far we have played only with the vanilla rules, may try the suggested fix for this issue next time.
Otherwise it is largely an exercise in risk management. Make sure you are not blocked off early, if it is going badly then get yourself enslaved for a while :-) Timing an attempted win is critical since the person to trigger Era 4 will necessarily suffer chaos, for this reason I don't like the proposed varient where this does not happen, that makes it too easy for a leader to close out the game.
Update : gets better with each play. Have seen several rags to riches wins from people enslaved early now. Still possible to get hosed by climate change for long periods but it is after all part simulation, these things did happen...
Whatever you do only play with the expansion, its half a game without.

Fascinating game that informs players about how the human race evolved. You almost play to watch it unfold as much as to win. My first game with three players took about 5 hours, but I didn't like I was floundering until the very end. At the end, some mistakes in earlier play caught up with me. But I had fun!

RATING: 7
Very provisional rating, as I'm really not sure what the heck I'm doing when I play this! So rating will change. Rules are okay, I think I get them (although got several things wrong in the first 2 players, quite a bit of exceptions to get used to). Like the map, hexes for cities, hex points for mobile units - very clever. Don't like the progress stuff being on a chart that gets covered up by the cubes and is upside down for half the players :( Would be better as cards you collect or something that has clear rules explanation on. Yes this is a learning the game issue - once you know it then the system provided will be fine. Game length is a problem, but again I'm sure this will tumble once we know what we are doing, really haven't got a feel for the pace or best strategies yet - when should you move to Era II? How many units should you look to put on the board? What are the best areas etc. Yes luck has a factor (last game I failed to domesticate anything ... killed off 3 species with my incompetence) but feels like it fits the theme. Not sure when to introduce the 'recommended' variants - if they're recommended why not have them in the main game??

I've played it solo twice to the point I think I get the mechanics.  However, I'm not enthralled with it.  It seems like an excellent simulation but the playability suffers from the simulated aspects.  Definitely plan to try it a few more times but I'm not sure that I'll ever bring it to the table.

Looks very complicated, and some BGGers have concerns about randomness.  I really like the impression of good scholarship that went into the game, but I don't know how much play it would get if I bought it, based on length and weight alone.  Should probably pass on this one.

Won't rate it, because so far I've only played one partial game, but based on that it would probably be at least a 7.5.

RATING: 8.5
What a wonderfully themed game.  I can't wait to play!

Update:  Played solo.  Thematic an immersive gameplay.  Luck can play a significant factor, especially early in the game.  Played as an experience it is a wonderful game.  I am confident this will really shine with more players as the actions in the game involve a continual interplay with others.  Works fine using the solo rules here on BGG.

This took me a little while to wrap my head around, I think it needs to be played in a certain way - and with more players, especially players who are highly competitive this game may come off as overly aggressive, imbalanced, luck reliant and involving some kingmaking and near player elimination.  However, if you are willing to give the experience a shot, play a learning game (even just Age 1), and support each other in the early stages of the game (especially until players feel they can keep their heads above water - and if it is the first game), then this is a thoroughly excellent game.

I really enjoy the sweep and scope of the game, I enjoy the building of the empire, the real struggle for survival, the ebb and flow of time, the growth and development of the 'empire' you are growing.  I really like the various mechanisms of economy that you need to get humming - population, innovation, map units, administration, elders and so forth. A wonderful game.

Update: Played again. Second time around I had a mental handle on how I was supposed to playing - managing my population, innovation, and map units, as well as the Elder Pool are all key aspects to progressing at a rate that won't cause you more harm than good.  Since I had a handle on the basic machinery of the game I was better able to tackle how to play it - including how to make strategic decisions about when to advance what and when not to (also as important).  The sweep of the game is wonderful - it really improves with multiple playings!  A great game that's plenty of fun and a theme like no other!

Update: more plays.  Love the game.  Once you have a handle on how to play the game, game-play can become quite strategic and interesting.  Luck is involved with domesticatin attempts and the chaos roll, but good play will always trump poor play.  There is a living story told with each game for those who want to take the time to savour the cards, card meanings and mechanical implications of game moves.  A wonderful experience.

RATING: 9
Origins is a unique game, both in terms of what it simulates and in terms of mechanics.  Furthermore, it's one of the only games I've played where I was convinced after one play that the game was a complete turd, only to have a revelation in the 2nd game and reverse my opinion completely.  On first play, you have no idea how to proceed, and the game seems terribly broken, in that if you make a few early mistakes you can limp along for the duration.  However, if you stick with it, you'll realize that, like Union vs. Central or Silverton, this is not a game that is about figuring out how to do x, y, or z, but rather about the extreme difficulty of doing x, y, or z, and doing it faster than the other players.  It is a game that requires "correct play" in certain situations - there are choke-points in the game that every player will hit, and likely there is only one way through the choke (most of the time, the choke point is climbing the early energy levels).  Once you realize this, and understand that the game is not about strategizing, but about being tougher and more adaptive than anyone else, that you will only be rewarded if you play the long game, and renounce turn-to-turn enjoyment or immediate payoffs, then you can begin to grok this one.  But once you grok it, you'll be very impressed by the scope of the game and the amount it simulates with some very nice mechanisms.  The movement of blocks between the innovation track, population track, and elder pool is the heart of the game.  These movements are filled with brutal trade-offs and timing issues that, if flubbed, can cost you dearly.  Phil Eklund is in a class of his own as a designer - he comes as close as anyone to making games with the depth and difficulty of wargames, but without simulating war.  His games are not for neophytes, but once you're worn of Euros, he is a good next step.  Just be sure to read his play tips and design notes, they are extremely helpful.

RATING: 7
I've finally had to tank the rating on this one. It's filled with clever ideas and tantalizingly interesting game systems. But it just doesn't work. Be the first to get a Culture card and clobber your opponents into senselessness! Blow a chaos roll and be forced into an hour of tedious pointlessness! It's just so incredibly fragile. I've had time with this game where everything is humming a long, and even with the chaos it's fun and things are going well. And then it turns into a flaming car wreck of game systems that just don't work, are poorly balanced, or fail to thematically gel.

A shame, there is the real potential for a great game here. But it's not enough to take a bunch of interesting science and make some systems that model it. You have to actually design a game. And Origins is just not a good game. It had me going for a while. But it's not. 

---

Still not sure what to make of this game. In some ways it's incredibly clever, but on the other hand it's unforgiving and needlessly difficult.

For what it's worth, here are my tips:
1) The Innovation track is absolutely crucial. If you allow yourself to get to far down into the '1' action range, it will take forever to recover and you will be badly constrained, possibly irretrievably hosed, and certainly somewhat bored. You MUST NOT allow this track to fall too low. Do NOT pass up Fecundity Decreases for marginal, or even significant, tech gains if you are at risk. There are of course exceptional cases that prove the rule, but you have been warned! Keeping your innovation track clear trumps basically everything, and you can kill yourself here.
2) As a corollary to the above, do NOT needlessly expand your population early. If you blow an Age I Chaos die roll and end up with a bunch of units clogging your innovation track, you are hosed (see above). Keep your empire small until at least Age II, when you have more tools to keep Fecundity low and can save a double-Fecundity decrease for a post-chaos recovery, or otherwise manage your return to golden times. It goes without saying, you do have to manage your various descents into chaos. If your innovation track is already borderline, an untimely chaos can clog the track to the point that it may be many moons until you recover.
3) The book warns about progressing through the eras too quickly, but it doesn't mention that it's your innovation track (not to beat a dead horse or anything) that should guide you. Don't dawdle in Age I or II. Get your energy, get an elder or two, and move on. Likewise, in Era III, get your elders, buy your cards, and move on. Moving too fast can be a problem, but the optional rules (all of which are recommended in the strongest possible terms) mitigate this risk for leaving Era I, and Era II and III really are bound by careful management of the innovation track more than anything else. Once you're in a good spot - you've got the prerequisites, a card in hand to mitigate the chaos, and the innovation track is in OK shape - do it. There is no reason to stick around in any of the ages once you are legally allowed to progress.
4) Acquire any public cards you can (at least until Age IV). Just because it doesn't count towards your victory conditions is not a good reason not to bid. All the cards provide powerful advantages whether or not they count for you, so try to get them. You don't want to give them to other players cheaply just because you're holding out for one that'll score for you. The advantages of having admin, culture, and information are all quite strong enough to get regardless.

I still haven't figured out if the game is worth the effort yet :)
---
Alright, I'll lower my rating to a 7. Origins is cool in concept, but I think there is just too much arbitrary randomness and too many hurdles that require simple luck to get over. It's a neat game, and I hold out some hope that the "short" Age III/IV game may deliver a little more on the promise, but right now this needs a few house rules to really make it work.
---
OK, this is a totally misleading rating, but what the heck. Origins: How We Became Human has a lot of problems. It's long. It's chaotic. The game will screw you over for no reason. It's unforgiving. The scoring at the end of the game is dumb.

But I found it a lot of fun to play, and very evocative of the theme. I love the cycle of golden age and dark age, I love that you [i]can't[/i] balance everything, to really succeed at one thing means unbalancing your position. At some point the cycle of chaos and progress feels a little forced rather than naturally-evolving, which would be ideal, but it's OK. I think the cards are nicely-done and give you options and are flavorful without a lot of rules overhead. The gameplay itself is refreshingly streamlined and clean for a game of this type and scope, and the helpful player aid card is great (although we could have used more of them).

Origins is a little bit too long, a lot too unforgiving, and the auctions and final scoring ultimately don't, I think, actually work. But I think I can see minor fixes that might deliver the ton of good stuff that is in here into the really fun game that Origins: How We Became Human should be, but isn't quite. I still enjoyed it personally. But for fans of much more tightly-balanced euros, it's a tough one to recommend. You need to be prepared to be frustrated.

I think I wouldn't recommend the full compliment of 5 players. I think probably 4, maybe 3 is the sweet spot. The advertised play time of 4 hours is quite optimistic; I'd suggest planning on 6 for your first time out. Era IV sounds like it would be really cool to try, but I'd budget another 2-3 hours, taking it from the realm of the plausible into the extreme. Whether fewer players or more experience would really bring down the play time that much is unclear to me. It would almost certainly help, but I'm not sure by how much.

RATING: 10
Guns, Germs & Steel seems to be one of the most mainstream sources Phil has used in his research for his amazing game on the origin of species, consciousness, and Reader's Digest. The bibliography (yes) features such audacious minds as Ayn Rand and Julian James, the game assumes interbreeding between species helped shape who we are today, and Phil has even included some original research, making animal domestication even more important than Jared Diamond thought it was.

If you don't subscribe to any or all of these philosophies, that is hardly the point. Origins is the most fascinating and pointed expression of a specific idea of history as I've ever seen. Even if you think it's 100% rubbish, the game is awe-inspiring in its ability to say: This is how I think it all went down. Whether viewed as an historical simulation or a fantastic simulation of an insane set of philosophies, its simulation value is enormous.

Luck? Sure, it's an Eklund. Early animal domestications are extremely important, catastrophes can wreak havoc on players' abilities to survive and migrate, and cards--the key to winning the game--will come up in totally random order and will often be assigned arbitrarily. Chance probably has more to do with determining the winner than skill. How important is this? Well, it depends on how you feel about the simulation. Players will absolutely be able to interact with and make significant decisions on behalf of their groups, and they will do this in every era of the game.

The rules are not terribly fussy, but the learning curve is intense. If you don't have someone to teach you, be prepared to make a lot of mistakes your first time out. Careful with the terrain rules! Once you've got them mastered, you're more than halfway home.

Production value is off the charts for an Eklund, featuring not just a mounted board but also over 100 wooden cubes! The design of the cards, in particular, is just wild. This is Gods Must Be Crazy stuff, like the designer had never seen a card game before. Nobody has ever seen cards quite so peculiar as these. They are delightful. The game is bilingual, but in the strangest, most inconsistent way imaginable--sometimes German dominates, sometimes English...it's a mess. The rulebook is a work of art, both for its strangeness and for its endnotes (which are worth the purchase price alone).

A unique and wonderful labor of love, and one of the best games I've ever played.

A brilliant game and my introduction to Eklund.  Origins is hardly as random as it seems.  Finely balance with a completely innovative system.  As far as my concerned both this game and Civilization shame all other civ games with their elegance and scope.

Update:
A year later, this remains one of my favorite games.  A pitch perfect argument for the dialectic power of board games.

Got through ten turns in about two hours for our learning game.  Harder to figure out than ASLSK1 for me.  Probably not a complicated game to play after the rules make sense to me.  I found American Megafauna more intuitive.  

Next session:  Got through many more turns in our second game.  Flowing better for me, but strategy concepts are not coming quickly.  Gonna take a few more games to understand what's going on here.

May 2011 - Too many other awesomer games to play.  Putting it up for trade.

September 2017 - [sigh] Considering the second edition when it hits. 

Of course, I'll probably lose to the rulebook like I have with his other games: Origins 1ed (failed), Pax Porfiriana (barely completed a solo game or two), American Megafauna (a success story - but alongside many rules questions answered online)

A great game.  Yes, it has unequal starts.  Yes, climate change can be random, and force you into uncomfortable (even game losing) situations.

And thats what is so wonderful about this game. Yes, the random climate change COULD mess you up- but it also gives opportunities.

This game, by having an interactive world that is VERY difficult to manipulate and thrive in, is more 'real' than so many others.  Through the Ages, while a good game, is pretty easy to manipulate through- the only challenge is from other players.  In Origins, the players can be the LEAST of your worries as you crawl and kick your up out of the Stone Age.

Great game, highly recommended.

I really tried to like Origin. I love the subject and the effort the designer put into this game. Reading the designer notes and background stories is very interesting.
However, after having played this game a couple of times I have some serious doubts. First of all, this game has a steep learning curve - you need to know when to advance and always put your first priority at fecundity decreases. Once you know this, the fun should begin, right? Well, it doesn't. Lot's of turns are boring - no movement and playing cards to get your innovation track clear.
The main dissapointment however is the lack of "feel". After the first few turns, it feeling of developing a primitive human ebbs away and the game shows it's true self: a clever mechanic, but no more. The info on the cards does not prevent this. 
I can't rate it below a "6", because I love the amount of work that went into it and would play it again sometime. However, Origin is not what I hoped it would be - a fun and entertaining game on human evolution and civilization.

Que rayada de juego madre del amor. El sistema funciona como un reloj, permite a los jugadores jugar partida muuuy largas, o más cortas, según decidan avanzar por las diferentes edades. Consiste en dirigir a un "monito" hasta hacerle un hombre de provecho jeje. No sabría como describirlo, es y no es un juego de civilizaciones, es y no es un juego de cartas, es y no es un juego de recursos ... no sé, el caso es que te pasas unas horas divertidas viendo como van pasando millones de años alrededor de tu monito, y como vas pasando por todos los estados de la evolución humana y también de su historia. Genial !

I can't believe that there isn't more chatter about this game.  It is simply amazing.  It is the first full civilization game to be playable in a reasonable amount of time.  Plus, each game is a learning experience as the cards have all been researched.  There is a bit of a learning curve, as you must balance the location of your units to keep from being thrown into frequent chaos.  This game allows you to infect opposing cultures with STDs!  How cool is that?

Origins is a fantastic piece of design. It's a game with opinions, and even if you don't share them then it's worth thinking and discussing them.

As a game, it's tight and competitive, although not as focused as BIOS: Megafauna and High Frontier. Where B:M has six possible actions per turn, and High Frontier has nine, Origins can have up to something like 28, and you need to understand them all fully. Equally, Origins feels a little more programmed than the above, since you need to do similar things to surmount each bottleneck, especially insofar as energy is concerned.

Nevertheless, an ambitious and mostly entirely successful game and simulation of a compelling subject.

Rated with the Era IV Expansion, and the living rules.

RATING: 6
Very tentative rating.  Players start with a tribe of early humans, and evolve and grow into modern civilizations.  A game of growth and progression, where players must initially evolve their "brain" and establish a foothold on earth, then progress through your more standard civilization advances.  Most of the stuff is done with "innovation actions" (where you learn) and "population actions" (where you grow on the map).  Quite a simple game to play, but learning it is another matter.  Reminds me a lot of Age of Exploration, where you have to absorb the rules from a rulebook, player aids, map, cards in order to learn what to do - very much the same here, but eventually it all clicks.  A chaotic, sometimes brutal game, that is very intriguing.  I get the impression to be successful you really have to control your tempo - the urge ot slap your population on the map before it fills up is strong, but that leads surely to chaos, returning half of them to your Innovation track, which will basically stuff you for several millenia.  Interesting.... at the moment, can't stop thinking about it.

The freshest and most interesting simulation I've played. Contend with the environment, the gradual introduction of new ideas, and not least of all the other species vying for the space.

It is far and away the best proxy for a big-scope "civilization game" that everyone has been looking for.

Phil is great at designing intricate simulations and this is another example.  There could be a problem with getting behind in the beginning and then struggling for quite some time to catch up.

Played twice now, and I find it very enjoyable. Like all Phil Eklund games, it is an extremely educational experience. It can be very frustrating if you have a run of bad luck and the game can be unforgiving toward risky play. It sometimes seems somewhat futile to plan long-term strategies, so you tend toward a more tactical "what's the best thing I can do on this turn?" style of play.

I don't think I mind so much that it's really long and random but the pacing fluctuates so wildly it can be quite frustrating, especially as the game is so unforgiving. Ok, who am I kidding? You really need to be very understanding about giving the game a pass on its duration and the randomness.
 
I mean, I do like it that it's a fascinating study of the rise and collapse of civilisations but it really needs a dedicated gaming day to get through the whole game.

a deep game that requires intense analysis to understand the value in the chaos of each turn, turning tragedy into advantage and becoming the dominate homonid is mean and necessary.

One of the most brilliant games about anything ever. The designer has a philosophy about the world and somehow uses cubes on a track and on vertices of hexagons to do everything about the rise and fall of civilization on Earth for 150,000 years. Literally, a mind-enlarging game!

This was one of the first games ever introduced to me by the inimitable Holmes! and I was an immediate fan. I love civ-builders, for one, but marrying something I hate (Randian objectivism), something I regard as total bunk (the theory of the bicameral mind), and a grossly overstated, blatantly political thesis (Guns, Germs, and Steel) to the genre somehow produced one of the most engaging and complex games I've ever played

There have been cries that it's broken or that you can find yourself in a death spiral but in the handful of times I've played it I've never found this to be the case. When playing you *have* to keep in mind that your goal is not to spread your subspecies across the world but to acquire VPs. Granted that goal is certainly facilitated through spreading yourself out but remember that every subspecies has different win conditions and those win conditions are closely tied to your subspecies' historical arc. If you can effectively mirror those paths your road to victory will be much easier.

Maybe the definitive Eklund-game, although not my favorite to play. Origins is very unfair to players who fall behind in development, and if one player gets more than a step ahead of the others, the game is virtually over, but you'll still have to grind through the bitter years of despair. It's still a great ride.

More than most of his other games, Phil's Objectivist philosophy is on full display in Origins. It also owes much to Julian Jaynes's book, and although I find these things very problematic in the real world, the insight to let complicated philosophical systems deeply influence and direct the development of his games makes them the best at what they attempt.

Philosophical agreement is not necessary to enjoy the work, no more than it is to enjoy a great work of literature or film.

Interesting simulation game, but slightly too long (7 hours with 5 players). The game is probably dependant on the fact that at least one player must have played it before and help you the first few rounds and keeping track that everyone is following the rules, as they are quite complex to remember, Still the game have several fresh mechanics, which I like a lot.

Unfortunately one of the worst gaming experiences ever for me. I became enslaved very early on and remained that way for the next few hours...my god, the boredom. It's not as if it was fun to watch the others very slowly push a cube or 2 around the board (I'm actually making that sound more exciting than it was). Even taking that into account I don't know how much I would rate the game. It didn't seem dynamic.
I would certainly recommend some kind of house rule that makes emancipation a bit easier to prevent my situation. A drag.

RATING: 6
Origins is a complete gaming experience dealing with the rise of man and his subsequent accomplishments. More strategy and decision making than any boardgame I currently play. There is a steep learning curve but the actual mechanics aren't hard to grasp once you've been over the rules a couple of times and after the first game. I would recommend a solo run before any f2f play. There's a lot that goes into a successful winning strategy, dealing with the ever changing world presented in Origins can alter things but not to the point that it takes you out of the running. Heavy boardgames aren't my thing but in the case of Origins: HWBH I'll play as often as I can. I've always been a fan of anthropology (strange as that might sound) and the designer has gone to great lengths to explain why elements of the game are the way they are compared to actual anthropological data. Besides being thematically rich this is a challenging and deep strategy boardgame.

If only I could play this more - whenever I recommend it, my friends "just played it a few weeks ago"; which they do, just not when I'm around :p

I like this game because while it has events that are relatively close to how the advent of humans on earth progressed, it also offers plenty of alternate reality scenarios. An ice age a bit earlier or later, tropical forests becoming deserts and vice versa at different times, and earth would look totally different today - and playing through all that, managing the chaos of the climate while struggling to balance the need for progress with the need for stability, all while trying to keep your neighbors at bay, make for a very tense and exciting game.

Damn, I love this game. The rules are opaque and it looks like it was designed in Powerpoint, but I love this game.

To quote myself: "...I think that Origins: How We Became Human is one of the best games ever, and one of the few shining candidates for shouldering the mantle of Board Games as Art. There are few other games I've ever played, or even heard of, that do such a fine job of communicating a designer's worldview through mechanics and theme. Every aspect of Eklund's masterpiece is aimed squarely at imparting his ideology and transmitting viscerally his views on human development, and it succeeds wildly and brilliantly.

And I say this firmly believing that a major cornerstone of this worldview--Randian Objectivism--is a piece of shit.

But I can't help but admire the game and its designer immensely. There are, certainly, aspects of the thematic implementation that might make some folks squirm. But don't think for a minute that it's not grounded in a coherent framework of facts and a consistent philosophy. No element of this game was inserted as random flavor text, it's all accounted for and part of the fabric of a singularly wonderful gaming experience."

RATING: 5
Great great ideas here and I LOVE them, but as a whole the game is just _unplayable_:

- horribly long (~4-7h without expansion) compared to the number and complexity of decisions made during the game and the actual playing time of a player

- rules are lenghty and that's not problem, because once you learn them, you follow them easily.  The problem is that most of the time you use only small subset of them and the potential possibilities.

- the biggest problem is, though, _many_ repetitive (and dull) actions (or even 'do-nothing' turns) that you perform during the game.  That makes the game extremely TEDIOUS and without tension.  This repetitiveness is a killer...

I DO NOT mind SIMULATION-like type of games - which Origins surely is; don't be surprised if anyone is hit by bad luck (like climatic changes) to such a degree that he would do nothing for the rest of the game (=several hours).  I can live with that [you might allow vegetating players to drop out..] provided the game gives you excitement, involvement and constantly tough choices (i.e. just fun).  It's definitely not the case here - most of the turns are boring and mechanical with not much to do, while interesting decisions pop up sporadically...

The whole design is too ambitious and definitely not refined correctly, but the biggest problem is that the game is just tedious.  Not much room for any other feelings...

Could've been a HIT, but it's a miss.  It doesn't surprise me at all as Eklund doesn't seem to be a designer who is willing to compromise with regard to his sophisticated and scientifically-supported creations.  They might be great projects indeed, but they are just not legitimate games...
That's Eklund's style and trademark and I surely do not deny him the right to create what fascinates him the most.  I just seem not to be the target for these inventions.

This is definitely an experience game.  The domestication will be the part that most Eurogamers object to, with the potential for die rolls to definitively go against a player or players.  But in the end the game does what it set out to do, which is model the rise of humanity.  Sometimes the savannas go desert and the giraffe-breeders disappear into prehistory, that's just how it goes.  This game isn't fair and balanced.  Try asking a Neanderthal how fair the last 30,000 years were.

It's not an easy game to wrap one's mind around strategically, and the sheer number of actions available can cause confusion on the first play, but the experience is practically unparalleled.

I would make clear at the start that it is acceptable to concede this game before it's finished.  Typically one player gets screwed by climate change and domestication rolls, and at least one other goes off the population deep end, and those players have a lot less fun than the rest.  Making them sit through Era III or, god forbid, Era IV isn't productive at that point.

I still like this game a lot, largely because I'd played solitaire before my first play and so learned the value of a high Innovation number without having to sit through a game in population hell.  Getting repeat players will be a problem given how unforgiving the game is to those who don't understand how to keep their populations stable, or who just get hosed by climate change, and that is a black mark on a very ambitious title.  Only civ-game diehards, and those who don't get frustrated easily, need apply.

May 2010:  Downrating to 8.  Played almost a full game (got into Era IV but didn't complete) with 4 players.  I got really bored after about three hours, which doesn't usually happen to me with long games.  A lot of turns just don't accomplish much - draw card, oh look, it's public!  I'm not sure how much game there is here with all the chaos of the events, but it is a fantastic sim and I'll probably play once every couple years on that basis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't usually rate games after only one play, but this one is a stinker.  It may be just that events conspired to make a small problem huge (dice and card draws play significant roles in this game), but it is bleeding obvious that one of the five starting areas is VASTLY superior to two others, and significantly superior to the remaining two.  Even with a proposed house rule to eliminate the possibility of climate change in the first round, it seems that it's too difficult to rein in a player that has started off to even a rather modest lead in development, particularly if they have an advantage in creating metropolises (as one player does at the beginning of the game).

I might play it again with the house rule, but I won't be looking for it to hit the table.

Perhaps the most ambitious game I've ever played, the game covers everything from the evolution of language, to environmental determinism, global catastrophes, climate change, animal domestication, immunization, slavery, resource extraction, exploration, war, social structure, male-female dynamics and more. It is a testament to the designer and to the potential of games as tools to spark thought and  meaningful conversations.

I am curious to see how Phil re-evaluates this in respect to his BIOS line. The luck of the dice and card draws, particularly those connected to climate change events and victory points, can be huge in sessions. A must play at least once if for nothing else than the experience.

I got to play with Phil, and I had a blast.  He put a ton of thought into the design of this game and its packed with information.  A takes some time to learn the game mechanics and the victory conditions, but after that, it was just fun.  It can be frustrating if your race is struggling (keep rolling 1's when trying to domesticate), but the game is simulating the development of civilization.  I really enjoy it and recommend it.

Highly complex civilization game. The game is not easy to grasp and comes with a learning curve. Players take the role of different species, each with their own starting abilities, limitations and victory conditions. The rulebook mixes English and German, while I would have prefered seperate booklets. On the other hand, this is the first rulebook I have seen with references to academic titles and an impressive list of notes. I think I like the game, although it will require additional plays to form a more definite opinion.

Really wanted to like this one, but after having the climate change BEFORE my first turn and hence being stuck for the next THREE hours with only one unit and little to do / nowhere to go I had to walk away (one player was the FLGS owner, otherwise would have been about 2 hours).

To quote another player on 7 Ages "I have no problem with long games, I don't even have problems with games that are heavily luck dependant, I do however have serious problems with games that are both".

Edit:
Fails as a game >> 2 of the player positions can be trapped by climate change before their 1st turn (Hobbit 5%, Cro-Magnon 8.3% chance per card drawn) while 2 of the player positions are vulnerable to being enslaved before their 1st turn (Neanderthal xor Cro-Magnon by Archaic Homo Sapiens).
Fails as a simulation >> Really too broad a brush to paint the course of human history post 1500AD (the great European expansion), absolutely pointless beyond 1850AD (Industrial revolution).

Another contender for the civ.light title although this one covers a considerable larger chunk of history than most civ games. The game starts with early hominids and ends pretty close to present day. Still it's playable in 2.5 to 3 hours. There's lots of information to track and lots of difficult decisions, but nothing to make your head hurt too much. The only thing I don't like is that's a little bit too random for my taste.

Only played 2 player so far. Probably better with 4! While there are some nice ideas, game flow can get stuck due to bottle necks, i.e. necessary requirements for further development of your civilization in order to be able to go into the next era (e.g. elders, metropolis, etc.). I also got the impression, that card play is very luck dependent early in the game and can lead to an early runaway leader - but this problem might be less substantial in a 4 player game.  All in all, however, the game is thematically dense and is a true civilization game. Rating would be much higher if the game flow would be better.

This design tackles a standard genre (rise of civilization) with an amazingly deep system.

The game is very hard on beginners, and traditional strategies of the genre will blow up in your face.  This game is more about the difficulties of maintaining balanced growth and a stable civilization, than it is about empire building and world conquest.  

This game will frustrate casual gamers and min-max power gamers, but will grow in your brain like an insidious disease. 

NOTE - play with the updated play aids and errata!!

Update - after dozens of plays plays... upgraded rating.  The way that the cards' can be reused and create totally different game experiences from one play to the next, rewarding different strategies, puts this one over the top.  An epic masterpiece that you can play in 2 hours with experienced players.

Some say American Megafauna is Phil's best game; but Origins is even better.

RATING: 5
Rating and comment after one play. This is a strange beast. There are some great ideas here - I particularly like the way climate changes back and forth and the need to 'develop' one's brain. On the other hand it is a game in which you have to work really hard to accomplish anything much and that work can go to hell due to poor rolls on the domestication tables or because someone happens to pick up a strong culture card early and starts stealing all your workers. I normally enjoy both luck and screwage, but in such a tight game it's not fun to have multiple turns worth of effort flushed down the toilet so easily (this from someone who actually won the game). The game can also stall out due to the order cards come out of the deck. In our game, everyone was energy starved as the card that produces energy was on the very bottom of the Era II deck. Population actions are also strange in that it seemed that half the time, players chose to not use all their actions because using them was detrimental to one's own position. All this combined with a very long play time (about 6 hours for our 4 player game) mean that I'm not sure I'd want to play this again.

Initial rating after one (long) play: 

Didn't live up to my expectation. Despite the scientific background, theories etc. it felt like way too much like average cube pushing and card drawing, especially after the first two hours. 

Feels like there is not enough game in here to validate a 4 hour play. The randomness of the cards, luck of the draw and the dice play to big a role for me to have real fun at first play. the only reason I still rate it a 6 instead of something less is that I'm inclined to try it again to see if I missed something. So rating goes either up or down, but won't stay this way.

Oh, by the way: The design of the rulebook is a horrible mess: English and german bits thrown in a chaotic jumble. The rules themselves are not bad, but the way they are presented now is a nightmare for your eyes. 

I'm really glad a geekbuddy tought me the game, would have been hard otherwise.

All the design mistakes that CAN be made WERE made. A doubtful honour.

Please Phil, let a designer look at your artwork and rulebooks and stuff before you put out your next game. It would make a difference.

Really cool, lots of original ideas for a civ game, and fun to play.  One of my best gaming experiences.

My only complaints are that the game can bog down midway when trying to get to level two energy, and then the modern era develops a little too fast and becomes o.p.  This is correct given the time scale, but I feel like the 4th age, if used, could be rescaled a bit.

I yet have to play with the most updated rules so rating might change, but basically I'm hooked. I expect rules issues to be ironed out eventually, so what is keeping it from 10 is the winning conditions - I don't feel they really reflect on-board strength, and this changing the winning conditions through revolution is more suitable for a game like Zombie Fluxx. But I probably just got something wrong. I'll learn as I play more, more, MOAR

While I do believe this game needs a few minor tweaks to the rules, it is a genuine masterpiece. What a great civ game.

This was my first Eklund game.  I searched all over for it and finally found one in May of 2008.  Luckily the same seller had AMF and the expansion too.  DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE.

Rating is tentative after two solo plays (to figure out the mechanics). Rule book: convoluted and a bit confusing. Some of the mechanics are elegant and interesting, but overall are repetitious. I'm not sure that the various cards do much to enhance gameplay, which is a bit thin, and I don't think that missiles or aircraft were around during the "Age of Faith". The components are nice. Overall, disappointing.

Very cool game. The rules aren't very intuitive, and we had to reset our initial game a few times. But once you have a grasp on what is going on and create a good flow, the game really shines. If you like civ type games, this is a true winner. I get the same kind of feeling when I play Through the Ages. Can't wait to play again.

[ImageID=247533micro][/floatleft][b]Origins: How We Became Human[/b] designed by [person=174][/person] (High Frontier, Pax Porfiriana)

With Bios: Genesis, Bios: Megafauna, and Origins: How We Became Human, designer Phil Eklund takes players through almost the whole breadth and scope of life on Earth.

[u][b]October 2016 UPDATE:[/b][/u] New edition hopefully in October 2018...
[q="phileklund"]I am working on a new edition of Origins, to be called Bios:Origins to emphasize it will be the finale of a trilogy covering the entire history of the Earth. The first, Bios: Genesis, appears in 2 weeks, and the second, Bios: Megafauna is slated to appear in October 2017. I just finished the first playtest copy of Bios: Megafauna (3rd edition). Bios: Origins is hopefully October 2018.[/q]

RATING: 3
Who needs tension, fun, and a steady pace when you can have the frustration, needless complexity, and abundance of do-nothing, go-nowhere turns that this game offers?  Why bother with wimpy concepts like balance and catch-up mechanisms when you can experience the thrill of a three hour death spiral thanks to a few unlucky rolls and draws in the first 20 minutes?  Put away your silly Euro-style games, with their play testing and their logically organized instruction manuals, and subject yourself to the underdeveloped, headache-inducing ORIGINS: HOW WE BECAME HUMAN, today!

I wish the play aids had been English on one side, German on the other and the background fluff in the rulebook, as opposed to English and German text together. 

Similarly, separation the two languages in the rulebook into two separate chapters, rather than half a page of each.

Other than that, another unique simulation from Phil Eklund.

A brilliant mixture of scholarship and gameplay. It feels like you are getting somewhere as you play. Very heady. Still, sometimes it does feel like the scholarship overrides some of the play aspects and it does take a while to get a solid grasp of many of its concepts. Despite all of this, O:HWBH works as a game. It is a good way to spend 2-3 hours.

RATING: 4
Mechanics of the game seem nice. The cards and how they can be combined are nice. Yet somehow it all doesn't seem to tie to whole. Dice. It really bugs me aswell, one could argue that its thematic how civilization can go distinct from even a small thing (multiple bad rolls after going into chaos to advance to next era) I don't think it really has place in a game where you try to build something. All the eras up until the last seemed a bit pointless buildup, which got brought down again-and-again. And how suddenly one lucky draw from the deck allowed one person to finaly brake into 3 energy and boost him up again. Strange strange game with very nice mechanics. I actualy hope we played it wrong...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Some nice elements and 'some' good mechanics, but others that just dont seem to work at all well and I think the game has a couple of flaws which seriously affect gameplay.  A shame, because it seemed there is a lot of good stuff in there, it just didnt gel well together and didnt really enjoy it at all.   Others I spoke to said the same, so this one will never see a play again.

RATING: 6
I rate this for being a game and not for being a simulation.
As a game, it takes too long. Turns go by without doing much, and you do not have many choices to make, strategical or otherwise. Sometimes, it´s tense, but these "sometimes" are simply too few, and most of the game it´s clear who´s winning.
This is a pity, as the simulation effect is very, very good, and I like a lot the research the author has done.
(This rating has been done after one game only, but I do not know if the game will hit the table very often afterwards - apart from solo games)

RATING: 4
This game probably wasn't playtested at all before it was published. The fact that you can be isolated before your first turn is not very appealing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Rating stays up: the game seems to cause trouble for players who do not follow the spirit of the rules and the game. If you are manipulating your population to have many babies and no innovative adults you are in for chaos. Thus, demographics is an important part of the game. 
Secondly, players do seem to suffer from advance disease, i.e. wanting to advance to fast. This game rewards careful play (thus making gameplay a bit slower than usual, so it´s nothing for those players who need quick success moments), so going fast through the evolution is problematic. 
Thirdly, there are several ways to victory but all have common roots. Ignore them and you are stuck.

I'm torn on this one - the theme is fantastic (although a bit sci-fi), and I love the idea of a cross between academic pursuit and boardgame simulation. Unfortunately, it has a few pretty big failings as a game. The animal extinctions, climate changes, and potentially punishing advancement tracks all present huge opportunities for players to fall irrevocably behind through bad luck alone. 

For what it's worth, the solitaire variant posted here is enjoyable. If you have a willing partner, a semi-coop two player is fun as well - just play for the experience.

3 plays so far.I think I understand the flow of the games and I really like the theme and lots of the mechanism but I think Origins has some very big flaws in the gameplay.1. I really one's game can be ruined early by 3-4 bad dice rolling. If you stuck in a small zone (desert climat and you can be stuck in south africa, jungle climat and the Hobbit can be stuck) and can't succesfully domesticate anything after 2-3 tries then the game will really be boring for you : 1. you can't place unit on the card 2. you can gain only one Elder 3. you can't improve your innovation because you have no place in the population track.2. Also it seems that you can become a slave in the first turn, even before you play (error on my part ?).3 . If you have a bad run, it's easy to get stuck to 1 innovation action / turn for a long time and this is a pain.4. Gamewise, it's anoying that the draw of the cards is the 1st action of the phase. Because people with 3  action draw and then spend quite a bit of time to think of there option.
It a deception.

I like this game, especially the theme and the scope.

The components: map = excellent, units = excellent, player mats = great (have a little too much theme on them for my taste) rules book = good (the dual languages was distracting in the original rules book, otherwise it is laid out well), victory conditions = needs improvement (they are only found in the back of the rules book - not as easy to reference during play as I like).

Once the mechanics are learned (usually after a session or two of false starts) the game start to flow and strategies may then be applied. But once the rules are learned then the weakness of the game system is more apparent. Overall this game seems like it needed more development time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not yet played. I hope I can find someone who wants to give this a try. Whether or not the game works well, I am fascinated by the designer's efforts to convert theories about the evolution of consciousness into a board game -- much more interesting than, say, another game about Renaissance merchants.

very few choices for many turns during which random chance dictates position.  Then you start to have choices, but still no actual control.  The rules are a mess and the gameplay is frustrating and tedious.  I wish the incredibly good theme integration were applied to a different game.

RATING: 6
We need to poke around for some strategy hints before we ever try this again.  With three players, it seemed pretty stagnant and we were having a hell of a time just keeping our heads above water, let alone figuring out how to advance to another Era responsibly.  Some neat ideas, but I'm not sure it's got a ton of fun in the box.

--Aug2011-- Fascinating - if possibly slightly insane - game of sociological and technological development.  I found myself (admittedly on a first play) ignoring some of the didactic elements as I concentrated simply on the mechanical elements.  I suspect a greater accommodation with the theme would result in a richer experience - though it's by no means certain it would improve the game.  In the end, unless it speeds up dramatically on a subsequent play, it's too long to get to the table easily.  We were in the 7 hour range the first time out.

More of a simulation than a game. The rules are much harder to read than the game is to play. Lots of concepts and terms to get used to.

A friend of mine once invented a movie rating system which avoided the pitfalls of linearity -- it paralleled hockey scores.  David Lynch's Dune is a 3-3 since so much of it is good, and yet also so bad.  Something inoffensive like I Love You Man is a slim 1-0 victory by comparison.

Origins is like Lynch's Dune.

The sheer audacity of undertaking to design a simulation of thousands of years of human history, not to mention the original development of the species, is humbling to say the least.  That Mr Eklund has come so close to pulling it off is a testament to his considerable abilities as a designer.

But, oh the headaches!  This is the zenith (or nadir, depending on your inclination) of The Experience Game.  Chaos in the form of cards and dice will not just club you on the head, but also knife you in the back, rummage through your wallet, hack your Facebook ID, then leave you lying in a pool of your own vomit in a back alley and run off to Aruba with your daughter.

The graphic design is by turns laughably bad and adequately competent.  However, through the fantastically subtle rules structure and appropriately detailed "flavor", Origins is one of the most intense examples of a game author's vision being represented absolutely clearly through design; a masterpiece.

Ultimately it is compelling to play, but it is hard not to mentally overinvest in your little species only to see it wiped out after four hours of play.  Not for the faint of heart.

After one hour of rules explanation... I was already too tired to actually play.   It took me a while to get the rhythm of the turn phases.  And even after a while the cards were getting more and more complicated (as you move through the eras).  It was hard to figure out a strategy not remembering how everything worked together.  It was just tiresome for the last hour when it was obvious I was not going to do well.   Plus some really bad dice rolls didn't help me at all.  Dice don't like me very much.

It has some deep qualities about it, and the designer really took his time in getting the eras to work with the technology advancements.  

Not my kind of game, but I can see where others might like it or even love it.  It's just not for me.

This is very difficult for me to rate, because I love everything about it, but for the Culture advantage.  The way that the Culture superiority works is just not fun for me, it ruins everything I enjoy in the game.  Anytime someone can just steal elders fully activated will have a huge advantage over anyone else playing.  When a player is relying on Elders for VPs it is especially crippling, though honestly not as much of an issue as you are not only strategically eliminated from the game, but you also are so desperate to get them back that you have little opportunity to do any of the fun stuff available.

I refuse to play this game again unless you play were someone stealing a cube for an elder just takes one of your cubes, you decide where from. 

UPDATE: Played with the new variant and it works great.  I upgraded my rating.

IMO, Phil Eklund can do no wrong. This is the penultimate origin of the species game.

RATING: 6
There's a staggering amount of historical detail and research in this game, but mostly in a good way. Living Rules in hand, I'm ready to take on another fascinating Phil Eklund/Sierra Madre Games experience - this is their transitional game to modern format and graphics.

Only out-of-the-box disappointment was that the card stock is very flimsy. Also, the side of the game box has Ara IV, The Age of Reason printed on it but that is not included in the game (which I knew beforehand - it's a separate expansion, currently unavailable). The bi-lingual presentation is a bit awkward at times, too.

Slow going at first, but very interesting as nuances and depth of play is revealed. The more I play, the more I learn. Still, this game remains too nebulous for us - it could use a few tweaks.

I want to love this game, but just can't until we can grok it...

RATING: 5
Good game, but serious (random occuring) problems may reduce the game into a series of turns with nothing but brainless die rolling without any decision making. After one play in which the game worked, and one play in which the game was SERIOUSLY BROKEN, I hope that the rules will be soon edited

OK: some errata appeared a day after my last play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Random events and card draws at the beginning of the game give players random boosts and penalties when you're in the least likely situation to mitigate these things. Then the player that pulls ahead is hard to take down since you're behind. Maybe if there was enough table talk to take them down, but generally it has been enough talk just to put a small thorn in their side. These random events making a winner would be fine in a filler game, but I don't need to spend 3 hours on a game that random card draws at the beginning can put a player or two ahead of the pack.

It seems that everyone plays with house rules to make the game playable for their group. I guess my groups should do the same.

Just like most Phil Eklund game this is weird and hard to wrap your head around the first time you play it.

And just like most Phil Eklund games you will find an awesome treasure of a game if you stick with it and start to grasp the game.

Eager to play!  Dear god, this looks more intimidating than High Frontier.  Which is sort of why I bought it.  I love the games that make my friends think I've lost my mind.

Edit: Having soloed and played against an opponent, I do like this, but I'm not yet convinced it's a great "game."  Both ended up with one player getting stomped into the dust, with no clear way back.  It might improve with experience but I suspect most of my friends won't stick around to find out.  My rating is based solely on my desire to play it -- I think it's really cool but definitely not something I'll find myself reaching for.

Further edit: A lot of cool ideas, a less than compelling experience.  Just too much going on for me to want to re-learn it every time, and thematically I'm so rarely sure what's happening on the board or what "victory" means.

Have only read the rules. Thousand-year turns creates some oddities, like an example scenario in the rules imagining Alexander the Great expanding from Greece to India in a single turn, deliberately planning to enter the medieval Dark Ages on the next turn so that he can from there get to the Renaissance.

I like the idea of a civ game where "bad" things that happen can ultimately, overall, be good.

The freshest and most interesting simulation I've played. Contend with the environment, the gradual introduction of new ideas, and not least of all the other species vying for the space.

I've now played one 4-player game of this, or at least attempted to.  We played for quite while but didn't really get very far. There seem to be a few difficulties with the game:
 1) the rules are not well layed out and mixing the English and German versions in the way it's been done is not helpful
 2) getting the game off the ground seems difficult. We ended up struggling to make much progress.  We all seemed to be caught in a vicious circle involving shortage of Elders, shortage of metropolises and full Innovations tracks.
 3)The game may not be all that complex (I'm not quite sure from what I've seen) but there is definitely a steep learning curve.  If you combine this with the other difficulties then it is hard to get into the game and therefore it's going to be very hard to persuade people to give this another try.It's a pity because I think there may well be a good game in there somewhere and the components, particularly the map board, are really nice.

Origins is a unique title - if you just want "a civ game" then you probably want Through the Ages instead. Origins, like all Eklund designs, is a combination of a game and a history/science/anthropology simulation, with some quirky, slightly disorganized rules and a huge helping of geeky scientific details. You play Origins as much for the experience and conversations as you do for the strategy and decision-making.

That being said, I think there's actually a pretty excellent [i]game[/i] here. Compared to American Megafauna (the only other Eklund I've played), Origins is a much tighter, cleaner design with a bit less minute scientific detail to distract you. However, you definitely do want to get the Living Rules - the game has been tweaked since publication to clean up ambiguities and make the randomness a little less brutal for unfortunate players. I can see why early reviewers panned it based on the included rules. In particular, the optional rules on Public Cards, Population Actions (Mining and Livestock Raids), and Domesticating in Uninhabitable Hexes all make it less likely that a single die roll will completely hose one player for hours or (conversely) give another player a gigantic lead.

Still, even with those tweaks, Origins is an unforgiving game. I think that strong play will always at least keep you in the game and provide you with interesting decisions to make, regardless of bad die rolls. But a poor move or a greedy play at the wrong time can easily sideline your civ for an hour of real time. This is not a nice, modern Euro with "catch-up" mechanics to cover over mistakes. So you want to play this with a group that can keep their focus over the long haul, otherwise civs start stagnating and the whole game becomes a slog for the table.

As far as time and player counts go, this is definitely an epic. A 3p game with 2 new players took us about 6 hours, ending after Era III (no expansion). I'd guess that would go down to about 4 if we played again, but it's still a long game. 3 or 4 players are good numbers here, but I'd definitely want some experience at the table before playing 4, much less 5. The game is playable with 2, but I think it becomes too zero-sum to work well, and you end up with too much uncontested space on the map. Solitaire rules are included as well, and they're reasonable, but you lose too much of the game when you don't have other Civs to contend with. It's not a game I see myself soloing with any regularity.

Overall, Origins is an excellent, fascinating game that creates a strong narrative and poses genuinely interesting questions. It's too long, quirky, and unforgiving to be something I'd want to play all the time, but it's definitely an occasional event to look forward to.

I really wanted to like Origins.  Really, really wanted to like it.  There's no other game that tries to be an honest-to-goodness simulation of how humanity emerged from our evolutionary ancestors, much less one that studies enough to use the anthropological theories of Jared Diamond and Julian Jaynes.  But having played it, it's a frustrating and overly-long experience that is a long way from fun.  

The best part of this game is definitely the beginning.  When you're thrashing about trying to develop your hominid's brain, invent rudimentary tools, and struggling to stay alive against the cruel shifts of climate, that's when this game really shines.  It's not particularly good as a game, as it all feels quite random and is sometimes a bit frustrating.  However, this can be excused because it works pretty well as a simulation, and has a good bit of charm, and together they excuse any mechanical weakness.

Unfortunately, that stage of the game soon ends, and the game shifts focus to an intensely punitive technology tree.  There are bottlenecks that will stymie players for many turns in a row -- Footprint 1, Metallurgy 1, and Energy 2 especially.  In addition, should you get a military advantage over your opponents, attack actions are cheap, easy to execute, deterministic, and benefit the attacker.  This creates an incentive for the leader to continually attack any of the other players who try for resources on the map.  The other players are reduced to drawing cards and hoping they get the right one to get them out of their hopeless military situation.  This isn't particularly fun for any of the players, and the simulation aspect also falls apart, as there's little strain on maintaining a small, mobile, punitive army, and no mechanic for cultural or technical appropriation.  One culture discovers bronze, uses it to overrun their neighbors, and nobody figures it out for 5,000 years?  Yeah, that would never happen, short of complete extinction or subjugation.

There's so much to love here.  It's crafted and designed with extreme care.  There's exhaustive notes and research.  The designer has grand ambitions, and has chosen mechanics that are clear analogs to actual history.  It's also very overdue for a Civ game to represent bottom-up cultural power instead of top-down Big Man theory.  But the game is just intensely frustrating, and the simulation is so fragile that it has a tendency to fall apart.  Eklund is a talented and exciting designer, but this is one that should be avoided.

Good game - after deciphering the utterly useless rulebook (downloaded revised edition). The author seems to have written the rules; cut them up into small pieces with a single section or paragraph on each; mixed them all up; thrown half of the pieces away; glued the rest of the pieces back in random order - done. The rating should really only be a "1 - clearly broken" because of the stupid rulebook.

There is cleverness here, but it can't save what is otherwise a disastrous game. The game is excessively long for how few decisions are actually involved- it is one of those games where you know what your next 3 moves are going to be (possibly 4 if the dice don't go your way), which means that you are sitting there for 20 minutes with nothing to think about. Awful. The way that cubes shift from the different areas of your player mat seems not-so-well thought out, and the arbitrariness of the card draws is heinous.

A civilization that combines area control, hand management, and economic factors. There is also some luck in card draw and dice rolling for establishing cities. Wouldn't mind playing again at some point.

Cool sci-fi idea.  I love the fact that the author is completely deadpan about ignoring the historical 4004 BC chronology, and throws in all this nonsense about brains changing  over time, neanderthals, cro-magnons, and such, to make it seem "scientific."  What a kidder!

This is a hard game to parse. I like how everything locks in together, but so many times it seems you're stuck in a "wait for a better card" pattern. Not for long, but enough to notice. And chaos seems a bit too devastating; a thousand years of nothing? Maybe realistic, but the game needs to come first. You should always have something constructive to do.

Euuuh... I think I like the game, maybe...euuh, yes... Is a little bit confusing the first time and playing at midnight.

Eventually sold this, mainly because of it's stupidly-shaped box, but also because of what I see as flawed thinking underlying the game.  That it's more about the experience than the game I get--but then the ideas behind the game have to be top-notch, and the Julian Jayne bicameral stuff just doesn't cut it.  Even worse is the rah-rah Americanism behind Age 4: elder boosts for capitalism, but national health care is bad?  Please.  On the other hand, the game got me to read Guns, Germs and Steel.

First Eurogame I've seen that really pulls off being a consim too (and thus ends up being neither). You'll have to play your very best game of skill to have a chance of winning, and even then you may still get hit in the side of the head with a 2x4 and knocked out of contention because that kind of random stuff happens in the real (or themed consim) world. It takes a sophisticated gamer to accept both these qualities in a game (but likewise it is a special game for having both these qualities in it)

 I like the game a lot, but its gets brutal to play if one player is doing good and the others are not (lot of downtime while they are running their empire).

For those who missed it, Silverback can take Peking man down to size.

Still wanting to play it more to explore it in greater detail because of its unique character when playing

Christmas present 2008. Looks even more difficult to learn than American Megafauna, thanks to the extensive use of both scientific and game terminology, combined with the bi-lingual English/German rules! 

LONG OVERDUE UPDATE. Much easier once the bits are on the table. Excellent game mildly spoilt by the garish graphics on the cards & the confusing bilingual presentation. Excellent game otherwise,

interesting game.  plays too long, unless all the players are speedy and expert at the game.  i liked the constant decisions to be made, and the theme was very well integrated to the game.  it is VERY interactive... almost a war game.  some strategies to be had with burying good cards in your discard pile.  some problems were seen when the disasters struck early, and basically froze most of the players into small territories.  seems very difficult to get power.

Fascinating premise but I found the gameplay counter-intuitive, restrictive and too unforgiving.

A marvelous "experience" game. There are some minor flaws, but overall probably my favorite "civ-type" sim.

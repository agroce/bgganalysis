Looks like a great overall game on the ACW. Love to give this a go soon.Picked up  a second hand copy in Adelaide. Has additional/amended rule set for leaders etc.

Setting up and learning 9/09. Interesting mechanics, particuarly with picking theatre for primary effort.

A seminal design effort for sure. The origins of initiative mechanisms which have evolved into CDG driven designs, the concept of Command Points, which force the player to allocate scarce resources to competiting demands are all present here. The ipmortance of leaders is handled simply and effectively. Rating increased!

Can't work out why the USA think that there has only ever been one civil war.

This game has an elegant design with many ideas that were well ahead of its time.  The only problem is that it is too easy to extradite your useless generals to places far away from the action.  With some rules massaging could still be a real winner.

From this casual wargamer's perspective, the best depiction in a tabletop game of my favorite period in American history. Fun to play and very well represented historically!



I may upgrade this to my favorite wargame - no, favorite board game - of all time. Each play is more addictive than the last, especially with the mods/fixes put in place by the community that loyally supports this game. After playing and looking at other grand strategy Civil War titles, this one seems to be the closest one can get to accurately portraying the historical realities of the war while remaining a VERY fun game. No game is perfect and this game has a few cracks in the pavement...but overall I would recommend this to any student of the war and anyone looking for a great strategy game in general. Upgrading my rating of this from a 9 to a 10!

The big debate is whether to use the rules out of the box, or try the latest fan-generated modified rules. We tried the latter at BROGfest 2010, and I thought they played well. It may be interesting to see how the out-of-the-box rules play. Dated graphics. This would awesome as a reprint with updated components.

This is my all time favorite game.  I cannot say how many games I have played, and look forward to playing many more.  I even bought a second copy, still in the shrink wrap, for the day when my original finally falls apart.  Could use a tweek or two with the leader rules, but there are plenty of &#039;house rules&#039; published to fix that.  If you are around Northern Virginia a need an opponent, let me know!

RATING: 8.2
This is a spectacular game!  I didn't get to play this game until recently and enjoyed it quite a bit when I played it with another firned that had played it quite a few times.  Ok, as the confederacy I got pounded but none the less good ol Booby Lee got the Union out of Washington... Yes Sir.  

I had seen this game floating around various forums etc, it just never caught my eye and for whatever reason, it never found me.

Here is why this game is great.  It does not follow the typicle progession of a "war game".  In spite of it, the system is simple, easy to learn and refreshing.  When I started playing the game, the first couple of impulses took maybe 15 minutes each by the end of the game(which sadly I wrecked beyond all hope) I was taking 1 minute per impulse.

This game for me, shook the wargame lover at his foundation and made me think of armies and leaders more than I had before not quite as much as terrain and events.  (how novel).  This  I would like to see this system cater me another war.

The game is finely produced for its time however I was slathering to custom build a copy during play.  Some of the helpful charts, and the economic bearing tracks etc could all be redesigned to facilitate game play.

If you haven't played this game and you are interested in history, or war games you might like to try it.  My friend I played with was a pro at this game and volunteered a wish list for some improvements to tweak the game further however this is a game that can be loved in spite of its flaws as you don't take it overly seriously.

RATING: 5
Another game from the 70s/80s that has a number of truly intruiging design elements, but is still basically unplayable nontheless. Reminds me of those semesters from hell in college, when every professer believed that his/her class was the only one you were taking. Well, a lot of VG/SPI games were that way too, with designers apparently believing that his game would be the only one you played. The Civil War is far too much time and work for a game that's going to be a one-off. Anyway, you can see the distinct imprint of The Civil War on Mark Herman's more recent For the People. A good, middle/high-end strategic ACW game has yet to be made, which is perhaps not surprising considering the difficulties (perhaps I give away my biases, but considering that essentially everyting that they had any business hoping for went the South's way, and they still got hammered, it's hard to imagine a game that's interesting for both sides).

RATING: 8
This game does the best job of making the ACW interesting at the strategic level.  It does so with its still innovative impulse system.  True, the system can get tedious as one rolls deltas of 1 and 2 so often, but the constraints make this game shine where others fall flat.  I'll need many more plays to improve my skills especially as the CSA, but I welcome those plays.  Which is a hell of a thing to say about a game that was 30 years old when you found it.

Still, the situation is what it is and after a point, around 1863, playing the CSA becomes a drag.

Have only had the opportunity to play this grand game four times, but I loved every minute of it (even when I was the Union and the Confederacy took Washington).  I'm not really into war games, but this one captured my imagination for some reason. Takes about 20 hours to play the full game, so only for the hardcore enthusiast.

Definite word of Civil War it is not. But it's VERY tense, intriguing, istructive and yes, even fun. We have redone ALL counters (with photos of generals and much improved artwork on standard counters). DON'T use the historical general reinforcements and set up: use the variable ahistorical random generals selection, it spices up the game a lot.

Not only the best strategic Civil War game ever, but quite possibly the best wargame ever.  A beautiful design, graphic standards that stand up today, a great rule book, and a fascinating topic.

Victory Games.  Really solid, heavy duty war game of the entire Civil War.  This game has it all - Generals, Armies, Cavalry, Blockade, Riverrine movement, Ironclads, Fortresses, and much, much more.  This game is very involved and takes a few plays to learn and become proficient with the game system.  This is one of the best all encompassing Civil War games out there.  If you are a die hard Civil War fan and like a complex, detailed war game - this game is a must for your collection.  Play time for the entire campaign is probably 20 - 30 hours for a full game.  This is a two player war game.  This is a top 50 war game on my personal list of best war games.

RATING: 8.4
The ACW was not very much of an interest to me until I got this game. There is only a slight (and abstract) simulation of the politics of the period - which for many is a plus - For me this is a minus (although not enough to detract from the game).

The game is long and the optional "Far West" option is fairly useless but the game does allow you to try several "what-if" scenarios. I also love the system where you don't know exactly when a turn is going to end - pure genius.

This is an old game so the "look" of it does look dated. If you want a Civil War game then this should be in your collection (although the others are rated good too)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Eric Lee Smith's masterpiece, and (IMO) still the very best strategic-level Civil War game.  It suffers some criticism for the vagaries of officer promotion, and might be too easily won by a Union player focused on naval operations (but even this is arguable), but still a joy to play, and quite effective in illuminating the strengths and weaknesses of the two factions, and the key geographic elements that helped shape the strategies for the respective sides.

The best wargame ever designed, due to the chess-like, innovative game system. Great game for PBEM, since moves can be exchanged on an almost daily basis.

More fun rated 9 for Union, and 7 for the Rebs as they don't have as much to do.  Would not recommend the FAR WEST section of the game, just silly and more tedious for the Rebs.  Would use the unknown leader variant, a big plus, that is not part of the original game.

RATING: 9
This is as immersive and evocative a game as I've ever played. It is a fine model of the ACW in many key respects (battle resolution; pace of operations; naval operations; supply and logistics), it moves fast and with little down time because of the excellent initiative system, and it manages to be detailed without being complex. That said, this ain't a game for a weeknight. You need time to play this baby, but if you have that time, you will be rewarded. But understand: this game is more about management and long-term planning, and less about bold strategic strokes and decisive battles--which is as it should be, but not to everyone's taste.  About the only wonky aspect is the leader system, which--let's face it--is the bane of all ACW games that address leaders. Do play with the optional leader rules, which are available here as part of the excellent updated (unofficial) rules.

RATING: 6
Excellent strategic level game of the American Civil War. The gold standard really, and it stands head and shoulders above [i]For the People[/i] (and most other ACW games) as a simulation.

The biggest downside is, as many others have commented, the playing time. The other major (and justified) complaint relates to the rules for leaders, and some folks have addressed this with their own house rules, which you can easily find online in various forums if it irritates you.

Update: My most recent play of this caused a major drop in my rating. The leader losses can be way too significant. Getting Grant killed before he becomes OC pretty much fucks the Union, and both sides can actually start to run out of leaders, and my friend said he actually played a game where all his cav leaders died. Just silly. The game desperately needs some generic replacement leaders.

On top of that, an incredibly long turn resulted in the destruction of a Union army and the capture of Washington. It stopped feeling like a Civil War game and felt more like Guderian encircling some hapless Russian forces. I was completely snapped out any period immersion and had to accept that it was very much a game and not a simulation at that point. The game really needs a better limiter on extended turns.

The best game of its size on the Civil War. Excellent, comprehensive game system once you get the hang of it. Excellent counter graphics, but I sure wish they'd done a better job on the mountain graphics on the mapsheet. I've played this thing umpteen times and keep coming back to it. If you don't have the time or space for War Between the States, then this is your next best choice.

A good system to simulate the battle issues across the country in the US Civil War. limited command points make better leaders important but with a limited numebr deciding on where they need ot be is important too. Not knowing when and where the show up helps simulate the shifting command capabilities through out the war. A good combat results table leads to far more "loose and retreat to regroup then wait for attack" sequence of battles. Which is historical.  It is a strategic game in nature but lacks a lot of the underlying politics that went on (that looks to be factored into the replacement rates etc.)_ Still think best Civil War Strategic simulation.

One of the better games at covering the sweep of this war ... also a bit of fun "out West" as well.  Now of course there is "For The People" (AH & GMT versions) which give similar depth at this scale ... and "linked areas" work better than hexes at this level.

This one makes my brain hurt in a that wonderful way that only a top notch strategic game can.  Plenty of room for long and deep strategies, but it keeps you on your toes with the variable turn length and available actions points(dice diff)

This is an epic game, but a little too complex for my usual tastes.  I remember someone making a GREAT moderator to run the dice rolling for initiative and keeping track of the command points, it shaved an hour or more off the game.

RATING: 8.5
A great, great game that is an absolute meatgrinder when it comes to playing time. This is a long game that seems to get longer the deeper you get into it (which I know is impossible, but that's how it feels). There are a few quibbles ... searching your stacks for leader promotions is a pain, and it doesn't seem right that those huge armies are immune to attrition save when demoralized ... but overall this is a brilliant wargame that concentrates just on the blood and guts of maneuver and battle in the war. Look to For The People if you want a faster, more politically-focused view of the war -- play this game if you want to grind down the South one hex at a time without the slightest regard for the Emancipation Proclamation (which likely reflects the actual military mindset of the war).

One of the better VG titles (that doesn't mean much, IMHO).

RATING: 10
Highly recommended simulation of the American Civil War. There are three different theaters of war; Eastern, Western and Trans-Mississippi. You have to allocate your limited resources to each of these theaters by selecting which one will be Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. Your opponent does this as well, both selections are done secretly. It is a very tense game because of the initiative system used. Both players roll two six sided dice to determine who goes first on this impulse and how much he can do. Sometimes he can do very little, sometimes he can do quite alot before you can react. This will cause you sleepless nights! As the North, you will feel the weight of the Republic on your back as you sweat because you know you're not doing enough fast enough. Why won't McClellan MOVE? It's April 1863 and you still haven't dug the Rebels out of Tennessee or Virginia. Lincoln can see the elections of Novemeber 1864 looming close. You must get moving now. As the South, you can't escape the feeling of impending doom as you look accross the river at the massive northern army. You know you can lick'em in a stand up battle. But you also know you can't take the loses that are sure to be the result. You hope Marsh Robert will choose his battles wisely. There are no more boys left on the farms as it is. Does Jackson and the Army of Tennessee come out of Fortress Memphis and fight the mighty Cumberland? Or do you meekly, yet wisely, let it lumber on south past you knowing he can't operate effectively with you blocking his supply? These are the feelings you will have when you play this excellent game. If you don't have it, get it. If you have it but haven't played it, play it. You won't be disappointed.

RATING: 9
Excellent: Strategic - ACW - Medium/Heavy

Sigh....if only I had some more time.

Plus:
-Theme
-Replay value
-Great integration of economics, politcs and military 
-Supply rules / theater allocation / naval rules
-Manageable strategic game

Minus:
-Coming and going of leaders can be manipulated rather easily (you let them die or send them to another theather of operatons.
-Heavy time investment
-Counterart not very inspiring (okay it's an early 80-ees game)

Playing the campaign will take at least three full days and the game can be considered a mini monster despite low counter density.
The designers is Eric Lee Ssmith but the game design reminded me a lot about Balkoski; there are various game elemts that are unique and innovative and make for a different game every time.

Theater actionpoint allocation for instance and the supply rules are great, the leaders, naval action etc are all integrated and work very well.
When playing a more complex game, this is high on my list.

Actually a thick rulebook but it looks more daunting than appears. The game is highly playable and after one playthrough the rules are not complicated at all and feel intuitive.

Greatest strategic ACW game to date.

A good game with various different strategies for both sides to try. A little too luck dominated on leader deaths while they are low ranked can doom either side (but especially the Union) plus the leaders get promoted too quickly. There are plenty of Internet variants to restrict both of these.

A timeless classic. This 1983 release by VG is as popular today as it was the day it was released. Wonderful map and counters only surpassed by the ease of play and the exciting ebb & flow the game simulates. A "Blind Leader" variation aids in preventing poor leader avoidance. A game I highly recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite war games of all time.  The movement mechanic was innovative.  Instead of a IGOUGO, you roll two dice; the highest roll has the initiative and spend activiation points equalling the die differential.  This mechanic creates a great deal of tension.  You are never certain when you will be able to put into place your grand strategy.  

Sometimes, there may be die differentials that allow you to put your plans into effect, but since you go first, your opponent can respond to your move.  Do you wait for another opportunity?  Sometimes, in waiting for the perfect opportunity, the turn ends suddently, and precious time is lost.

 This game gives a great overall feel for the major military objectives of both sides, without restricting players to the historical choices.

There are many strategic options for both sides.  Great simulation.  Great fun.

Playing time is a bit long (it will take most of a weekend), otherwise, I would give it a 10.

I’ve only played this solo, and that 30 years or more ago. I remember really wanting to like this game, but finding the rules gnarly uphill work, and the game itself bloated and over-long.

I also remember being annoyed and upset by the way the leaders influence the game, upsetting the kind of historical accuracy that most of the rest of the game tries so hard to establish. Tries, but fails, in that the rules themselves tend to be more influential on the board than the strategic situation - a huge flaw in such a sprawling game.

One of those games that’s on my shelf for nostalgic reasons, because I can’t envisage ever playing it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
There are some interesting mechanics, such as the leader promotion and the use of depots for supply, but overall, it lacks the flavor of other ACW games like A House Divided and For The People.  It feels very process oriented, with the CP table, dice differentials, blockade level and commerce raider procedures all serving to slow down the pace of play.  

This may have been a good game in the 1980s, but it just doesn't work very well now.

This is by far the best game covering the entire Civil War that I have played.  It is a game that my friends and I have played about 25 times, and after 20 years we would still play again.  The rules are thick, but the flow of the game is smooth once you get the rules down.  The game takes about 15 hours to play from 1861 to 1865.  The South can win this game, but it is tricky.  The game does an excellent job of capturing all the inherent problems faced by both sides.

Finally played this game on September 3, 2008 at EPGS. The person who showed me the game has modified the leadership rules. We only played most of 1861 before ending but I would play it again. My major complaint is that the leader counters are extremely difficult to read.

The activations & commands mechanics are very clever. 
But the game, as the rules, is REALLY long (definitely not a game for one evening).  

The biggest weak point of the game are the generals: There is absolutely no need to use the "bad" ones, they spent all the game sitting around somewhere far away from the enemy doing nothing. Is that historical? The could have been left completely out.

A superlative game for a great war spanning across the whole eastern and western theatre.  Supply problems are simulated with the East-West war effort dilemma for both the Union and Confederate sides.  Leaders abilities are incorporated into the initiative/ movement/ combat systems.  All major leaders are present in this game.  More complex than other strategic game like "A House Divided" by GDW, the game is for the serious wargamer who wants to take an in-depth study at the war and enjoy a deep strategy thinking process. Gorgeous wargame maps for the entire United States of America.

One of my favorite wargames, and one of reasonably easy to learn (well relative to Third Reich and Pacific War).  The rules keep things rather simple without ever seeming too abstracted.  The initiative system is great; you never know whether you can complete your plans in time before the turn ends.  The feeling of having sparse resources to spread around and not enough time to use them all, really comes through (and captures the history).  Its important to protect the eastern capitals, but more movement happens in the west; how do you distribute the few replacements?  When do you start emphasizing the naval war, with its short-term costs, but long-term benefits?

There are some interesting mechanisms in this game but ultimately I felt like there were too many rules and stuff to keep track of.

A great game that has stood the test of time like few others. Unfortunately time is quickly running out for this would-be classic. It takes quite a while to play, features a clunky, tedious system of random activations, and features battles in which both sides are usually demoralized and must rest before joining battle again. While true to actual events, this can become quite tiresome, reducing a fortress for example can take many hours to accomplish. Having said all this, the game is worth a look, especially if you are a Civil War fan.

RATING: 7.2
Well made game with a realistic blockade effect upon the Confederacy in the later campaign game. The effect of hopeless leaders can be too easily remedied by making them stay out of harm's way. A fun hint is to use the random leader appearance rule. Will make most nerds get out at the worst possible time and then they HAVE to be used in some forward way. 
A minus for the Western secion of the map that is difficult to place together with the main map on any ordinary gaming board (see a picture of the two maps to get what I mean).
Fascinating though, is the realistic effect of the behaviour of opposing forces. Armies can never outsmart the other and make a race for it à la German invasion of Russia in 1941.

06/15/88 Bought. Nice game. Yet knowing how a new general will perform before he's ever in combat is a bit strange. I like playing the Far West map, where I can defend my home town of Fort Worth (which was an actual fort in those days) from Indian attacks.

Used Wargame Academy update to the rules (ones that, among other things, prevents Leaders from hanging out in bars in backwater towns early on.  Has innovative concepts that generally work well.  Liked the Far West optional rule and map, which almost all overall Civil War games ignore.  Took us 34 hours to play the full duration game with almost all optional rules, but has shorter scenarios-- and others play it faster than me.

Read the rules, which are very complex. The rules definitely have an '80s feel to them--very detailed with lots of repetition and not enough examples. Writing needs to be streamlined and simplified, but the mechanics and concepts are sound and hopefully will be interesting to play. There just seems like too much to remember.

I really like this game. The system, while complex, works well. After playing a couple of turns, the rules make a lot more sense. A new edition definitely could use a streamlining of the rules. More variation in reinforcements would add interest to the game.

My favorite strategic Civil War game. Variable command point allocations by the three theaters (east/west/trans miss/ always leave each player wanting more because there is always so much more to do. More complicated than A House Divided but much less complicated than For the People, I am waiting to see how this stacks up against Price of Freedom. Update: Much better than PoF.

Edit: this is a great game, but Lincoln's War now surpasses this as my favorite strategic level American Civil War game.

I used to play this game a lot, but now I only play War for the Union (Rob Beyma), which solved most of the annoying problems in Civil War (leaders, naval operations, luck of the activation system).

RATING: 6
Probably THE game on the American Civil War for the last thirty years, despite its warts. It is a bit like Frederick the Great in that you don't want to send Grant or Lee into an attack by themselves just in case there is a leader loss. This also allows for cheesy game playing like sending McClellan off on a suicide mission just to get him replaced.

The FAR West option is something you will want to play with once just to say you did it but it is even more of a sideshow than the Trans-Mississippi theater and will probably be ignored for much of the game - despite all the chrome attached to it.

I don't mean to suggest that it is a bad game because it is not. The command points and pulses in a turn is quite ingenious and lends itself well to solitaire play. However, the latest release by GMT should scratch the same itch in a fraction of the time it takes this one to play.

First - allow me to state my bias.  I loove Civil War games and they're high on my play list.

In my mind, this is hands-down the single best strategic level Civil War game ever.  The command point system, rules for using leaders, and balance the game provides really seems to put me in the seat of Lincoln or Davis and their generals.  You'll sweat where you spend your commands, hope to get the most out of your allocations, and more than occasionally pray for the right roll of the dice to let you do what you want, end the turn, or give you the commands you need to finish what you'd just started.

The number of rolls in the game do a great job of evening out the luck factor, although a "bad run" of rolls for the wrong things at the wrong time can be disastrous.

The big flaw is the leader death/promotion rules.  But those can be fixed with some house rules and variants that are easy to find.  The smaller flaw is the length and the two-player only nature of the game.  I'd love to pull it out more frequently, but it's just hard to get a one-on-one session of sufficient length to play the game out.

I'm torn on this one...a brilliant, brilliant design...way ahead of its time.  On the other hand the leader and combat rules were very dicey...it seems like the Rebels could always dice their way into DC.

The game was well developed in terms of rules clarity and so on...but not in terms of cut-throat competitive play, which revealed a number of rebel gambits actually that are almost impossible to stop, and ahistorical.

The old VG hex version with two maps and lots of units and many, many leaders, most of them rubbish. Since the game usually revolved around getting rid of your bad leaders (and getting round the rules trying to stop this) it could get a bit farcical. No sane Union Player was ever going to put Burnside or Sigel in charge and the result was a tottering stack of Union leaders sitting on 1 SP in Kansas. Otherwise the game was good slugging match. I sold it (with a large coffee stain over Texas) after I bought For the People.

RATING: 10
----- [1] In May 2016 after 33 years, Victory Games Eric Lee Smith's Civil War is still probably the best simulation board wargame which covers the whole US War Between The States.  Included in my analysis are the 2015 GMT Civil War & Lincoln's War.  The VG-CW surpasses these two games and is despite para [2] below.

----- [2] This analysis also includes the fact that the original VG-CW rules were abysmally, horribly, & badly written rules, especially in the area of syntax.  These rules are incredibly hard to follow.  These facts continue to remain even with the relatively recent WGA (Wargame Academy) 3rd edition rules.  These WGA3 rules, by the way, do substantially help the original, but still abysmally written rules.

----- [3] Buy & play Victory Games Eric Lee Smith's Civil War.  If you can make it through the rules, you will be well rewarded.

I do think VG did a lot for the hobby in the 80's. They did produce great games and this is not an exception. The Civil War, is fact the origin and roots for several games developped more recently (by same designers or other peopl) published by GMT (For the people) or other companies. It is a very good game to be played by two people with teh complexity enough for expereienced wargamers.

Great game, innovative command point system, there could be a million things going on one turn and the next turn goes by in an instant with nothing happening.

A classic to this day, and possibly my favorite wargame.  Now if I can only find someone to play with and the time to do so...

The best simulation of the strategic level of the War Between the States (I give my bias there). It is a complex game and requires a time investment but captures a lot of the issues facing Lincoln and Davis. 
Particularly like the use of "action points" to determine how much activity a  side can support. The combination of reinforcements and supply line builds with actions and the variable number of actions which can occur during a turn. 
Has a good balance of the strength of the force versus the impact of leaders

I saw only 2 flaws to the system.
The leader promotion rules allowed too quick of an advancement. Also there was no provision to encourage the use of poor leaders for political reasons.

Look into some of the leader variants to prevent automatic promotion of leaders, this makes attacking to get leaders promoted a less viable alternative. 
Also play with the variant that leader must stack with an sp, and not with just a depot.
Finally there is a variant that gives VPs for using commanders such as Polk & Butler to lead the armies in command.

It has clever mechanics to activate units, but less comprehensive than For the People to portray the political aspects of the war (which military campaigns is only a mean to get Foreign Intervention for the South or for Lincoln to win the Vote in 1864).

As strategic Civil War games go, this is one of the best. If I'm not mistaken "For the People" was partially based on the mechanics from this game.

On the other hand, there is enough detail to not be boring.  The sparring of the armies can really be felt in this game.

Certainly looked like the definitive treatment. Rulebook was overwhelming, though, and my countersheet seemed slightly off-center and hard to read. While I could  perseverve through rule sets like Third Reich, my interst in the ACW wasn't strong enough to take this on. Moved on to AH's version of For the People, which I still enjoy (although the GMT version looks like it could give CW a run for it's money in complexity). If you like the grand detail, CW seems like the one to get.

VG The Civil War is my favorite 2-player wargame of all time.  It has all the tension of some of the best CDGs, without needing cards, due to the excellent impulse initiative system. In spite of some issues with the way leaders worked in the originally published game, I think this is still the best 2-player cardboard strategic wargame of all time.  And I have played Twilight Struggle, Paths of Glory, and Here I Stand, the current #1, #2, and #6 ranked wargames on BGG (as of early 2011).

In my experience, a full 19 turn game takes about 20 hours, with one hour of that being set up time. It's good for a long weekend, or a game broken up into 2 or 3 or 4 sessions, if the game is left set up. It's also good solitaire. And there is a fine Vassal module for PBEM play.

This game has been revitalized by the new Wargame Academy unofficial 3rd edition rules, which can be downloaded here on BoardGameGeek. Because of the 3rd edition, I'm upping my rating of the game. It fixes most of the problems that the game had with game play (can't fix the old 1980's map and cardboard, but so what?).

Would love to play this, I've read the rules a few times but need a play through to get a feel for it.

I have several copies and hope to give the WGA rules a spin.  Top drawer game and often available at bargain prices as the herd moves on to newer stuff!

Still great after all these years. This game is very nicely designed. I was blown away by it when it first came out in 1983. I found it easy to learn and fun to play. It would be nice if this game was re-issued with bigger hexes and a more modern look for the units.

The BEST grand strategy American Civil War game. Simulates the stress on both sides in a playable manner. The priority for each 3 month turn are given to the 3 theaters. Once the turn starts it can end quickly or go on for some time. Command points are used to move troops/leaders. There is a lot to understand in this game.

One of the more enjoyable big wargames I've played. Hits that difficult to find spot where the game is complex enough to feel like a historical simulation without being so complex it is unplayable.

For many years this was my favourite strategic game covering the entire Civil War. After "For the People" came out with its card driven system that take politics into account and outside forces,Mathis game seemed less relevant. It really needed to be upgraded with a better map and more interesting counters.

But, with the upcoming release of GMT's new Civil Wargame this is one that I will never play again.

A pretty good game on the Civil War. If you want to play a strategic level game on this subject and only have limited amount of time and space this is it.
Relatively simple to learn. I once taught my wife to play this and she promptly whipped my butt. 
For a much more exciting and more comprehensive strategic level game on this subject I recommend Decision Games War Between the States.

With an estimated playing time of 1200 min, I think it's going to be "A House Divided" for the foreseeable future.

Everything is bagged and labeled. Box has some shelf wear and one split corner. Rules book, player aids and maps are a little worn from use. Does not include dice.

The interaction of leadership, logistics, and Union river/sea power is brilliant. More playable than it looks. Achilles heel: takes too long. A mini-monster, is still a monster.

A classic for the Civil war.

Even in 2014, this game looks worth for playing several taimes.

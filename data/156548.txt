Kickstarter received and played: the new rules and addition of an arcade mode have made this game outstanding! To those who backed on kickstarter there is also a ridiculous amount of extra goodies from pledge goals that you would expect from a full expansion. After a couple of play throughs it is difficult to find fault.

The big selling point of this game was the beautiful minis and the pure co-op "Arcade" mode. Although this mode doesn't entirely bring everything you can want to the game, it does offer a quick and neat way of resolving conflict, that gets more intuitive with subsequent plays. Looking forward to the SDE: Legends expansion so this can have the campaign mode it so strongly requires. At the moment, a great dungeon crawl with an incredibly cute theme.

The SDE redo is still a long, meaty game disguised as something lighter. The components are absolutely outstanding, as before, and better yet we don't have to glue the sodding things together this time round. 

For a group I play with, this is the go-to Dungeon Crawling experience. They prefer it to Descent. Although personally I feel there are more elegant games out there, SDE is without question an excellent game that brings bags of good gaming to the table.

Although I admire the Arcade Mode and I'm glad it's there (SDE is now two games in one), I don't personally enjoy it. I feel this game is already quite fiddly and rulesy and Arcade Mode adds in even more to the mix. Arcade Mode doesn't pay out heavily enough to be worth all that effort and investment. However, Classic Mode is still a storm for our group. 

I'm happy to play this whenever it gets requested and I've gone to the trouble of getting the upgrade deck for the original cards (which is good as it comes with all the promo and extras that we can now proxy). I've also picked up von Drakk and the other big expansion. I'll be surprised if we don't fork out for SDE: Legends when it is released too. Gotta roll dem stars.

Played this game once and I have to say: Huge dissapointment. Very slow slog through a dungeon without exploration. It takes too long to finish the game and the Forgotten King itself is ridiculously hard. That boss has nothing to do with tactical combat.

With a half-trained dungeon boss player the heroes will not have a chance to beat him.

Sorry - I cannot see where this game should shine besides its content and production value. But the gameplay itself is so bad.

Really - no comparison against modern miniture games like Galaxy Defenders, Gears of war,Doom, Descent 2 or Imperial Assault.

If I want to play a heavy dungeon crawl either solo, coop, or against a DM, this is my go to game. The new rules are fantastic. Well worth the dollars to collect it all. The new Forogotten King stuff is excellent. The Princess Emerald bane and frost combo is a must for dangerous mini-bosses and elites.

This is the most beautiful game in my entire collection.  The minis are gorgeous.  I very much enjoy the arcade game play (I usually play this as a solo).  The game feels like an adventure, and I love trying all of the heroes in the game.  

There are some cons.  It can be long.  There is a substantial amount of upkeep, and I am sure that I do not perform the upkeep right every round.  Getting all of the enemies in their right place every turn is burdensome, so I just move all of the little dudes as quickly as I can so that the game moves along.  I would hesitate recommending this one as a solo game to those that like to do things exactly right pursuant to the rules.

Kickstarter.

Received everything, still unhappy with the communication level of SPM when so many people had issues with their orders.

This may be the worst experience of a game I've ever had. At no point was I having fun and everything was just a slog for me. There is still potential with what is available, but with the fact that the third set of rules for this game is coming out soon I'm done. Luckily my daughter loves to use the figures and tiles from this game to stage massive imaginary adventures.

RATING: 6
A very fun game with very nice miniatures. Certainly improved over 1st edition.
However, game length drags though and as such SDE often outstays its welcome. Fun, but decisions are often obvious. If this could be played in 90 minutes, it would get a much higher score. Can turn into a bit of a slog and players disengage.
A keeper, but won't see as much table time due to the length of the game.

I love the concept and the actual models, but there is no game here.  Any attempt to play results in 3-4 hours of regret.  I've only seen the DM slaughter the heroes and players lose interest.  This game only works when you play user variants or house rule things on the fly.  It also looks like there has been no PVP support since 2014.  This is really sad since I think this is probably the best mode for a game like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Classic mode only (Consul vs Heroes):

Solid Hack'n'Slash dungeon crawler. Once you know the rules, the game flows very naturally and the mechanics are fun. Loot progression is fast and with a bit of luck you will have buffed up heroes in no time. Consul play is also very rewarding with enough decision making. 

I think I prefer playing with 2, 3 or 4 players max, preferring 3 players with the 2 hero players both controlling 2 heroes. 

The game has a bare minimum of storytelling and no event/mission type of stuff (other than kill everything) so if you are expecting this from this game, stay clear.

Oh, and awesome miniatures :D

The forgotten king is a very good and much needed revision of the 1st edition rules. I'm still working them out for myself, but they already seem like a significant improvement over the old version.

Very good dungeon crawler.  The arcade mode this introduces is also a big improvement as it lets everyone play co-op (although the classic is still the overall better game in my opinion).  Takes a while to get through each game though and often is a little unbalanced (dark consul has advantage early... and heroes slowly gain the advantage with each passing turn as they secure loot/equipment)

A great co-op dungeon crawl with some amazing chibi miniatures.  The game reminds me a lot of the original Gauntlet arcade game where the players are working their way through a dungeon, battling monsters, eliminating monster spawners, and collection loot.

The addition of the Arcade Mode in this version of SDE allows for full co-op play since no one has to play the role of Dungeon Master (though they still can if they want  to).  It also opens the game for solo play as well as some other interesting game types.

Summary: Fun but clunky. Form over function makes the game too much work. Arcadia Quest is lighter but a lot more fun.

The grid squares are too small for the figures. We had to regularly rotate figures to make them fit, often knocking over or shifting nearby minis in the process. Minis facing away from the target so that they'd fit hurt the immersion.

The gang AI felt clunky and error prone. It isn't helped by difficult-to-read-at-a-glance creature cards to figure out who was who (the figures have a certain sameness about them -- painting would definitely resolve but I don't paint, so...).

Soda Pop have really valued form over function here. . Card design is terrible, with incredibly tiny icons for ATK, DEF, abilities, status effects and so on. Multiple minis share a single card, the card itself often divided in two sections (one for standard, the other for elite). There's so much colour and lack of restraint in the art direction (everything is so shiny!) that making out meaningful details is a chore. Oh, and you have to refer to the cards *constantly*, so they needed to be simple to read.

The game itself is quite fun and we had a fair few laugh out loud moments, but this was severely hampered by the clunkiness of it all. Give me Arcadia Quest, SW:IA et al over SDE any day.

Note we only played the co-op mode, 3 games in total.

RATING: 2.5
(Arcade Mode): The Hero activiation has a special rule in this game. Assume there are 4 players; 2 pl. get activated, then the monsters. Then one other player gets active mandatory and the second by choice of the team.
This means, that theoretically one player may play all the time and another not once in the game.
In our actual 3hrs game one player (me) got only two activations (move/fight) in the whole game.
Now judge yourself if I had a fun time or not!
How can designers implement a single rule that turns an otherwise solid designed game in a bunch of broken rotten crap.
Yes you can simply houserule this that all players get the same amount of turns, but I have to rate the game out of the box... :-(  otherwise it would get a 6 or 7 from me, because gameplay wise it's a generic dungeon crawler with nice minis.

A fantastic game. There are definitely some flaws with how long games take (depending on player experience), un-specific/un-clear rulings, and OP rules favoring both sides. But with the flexibility of adding home rules can be a great game.

Just finished a Game of Super Dungeon Explorer : Forgotten King.
Quick review for any other TTG/Anime fans.

There was A LOT to learn initially with so many rules but I think we finally got it down pat. Plays very much like a more complex version of Mice and Mystics.
Very fun game, has a D&D meets anime game-play with awesome well designed Minis. 
We played through a 2player 3 tile game using only what came in the forgotten king box (no mixing with previous box). 
I survived 2 mini bosses but sadly died almost instantly when the Forgotten King spawned. The game started hard, got easier as I pulled good loot but then just out right jumped 3 levels and out right killed me when he arrived. Reckon it would be a lot more fun with more players, but would be very difficult if they weren't tactically minded, or team players.

I Played as the Questing Knight, Princess Emerald, and Thunder Vale Huntress. 
Consul played as : Bashful Borris, Trent Kodama, and forgotten King.

Took forever (about 7 hours!) but mainly because we were learning everything from scratch. Now we've got it learned imagine that time would easily be 2-3 hours tops.

I enjoy this game when I have a chance to play it.  Comes with 2 modes of play - Arcade (automated dungeon) and Classic (player controlled dungeon).  I have only played Arcade in this version.

Pros: 
 -Miniatures and components are very high quality.
 -Gameplay is reminiscent of "Gauntlet" series of video games.
 -Complex gameplay keeps players thinking.
 -Well thought out dungeon and enemy automation, lots of variety in enemies and dungeon styles.

Cons:
 -Long setup time.
 -Games can drag on for new player.
 -Lots of special abilities to keep track of throughout game.

Overall:
I enjoy this game, it also satisfies the hobbyist in me by allowing me to paint the miniatures.  I wish I could play more, but the setup and play time can hinder that.

Ahhh... Super Dungeon Explore, how I do enjoy this game. While not my entry into the addiction to plastic mini's this was certainly my entry into the board games version of the addiction, and never regretted it since. 

Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King very much improves upon a number of features present in the original Super Dungeon Explore, the first and foremost of which is the introduction of the arcade mode. I cannot count the number of times I ended up in the role of the dark consol with the only option but to funnel minions down a kill track only to end the whole thing with starfire nuking everything from range. Arcade mode does a lot to pickup the pace of the game as well as bring you into the play of things as a group.

Also the removal of the loot-o-meter, as much as I liked the basic concept I'm happy to see a more streamlined method for advancing through the dungeon and moving along the course of the game rather than being forced into the final confrontation with the boss gaining 2 extra activation rounds and as previously mentioned, nuking the party from orbit.

The game still isn't perfect however. There are some areas where some balance on some of the hero's make their inclusion almost automatic and some being rejected entirely. Also the rule book, while vastly improved from the 1st edition, still needs a few more tweaks to make some of the information needed to run mechanics go just that bit smoother.

As for the miniatures quality it's exactly what I expect from Sodapop Miniatures, they are great sculpts with really great detail and options for painting.

If you are a fan of great miniatures and of a great game to check out with friends and family I cannot recommend SDE: Forgotten King more, just spend some quality time with the rule book and maybe a play through video before you dive in :)

07-28-2015 - Too much to keep track of.  You're listening to someone who has Arkham Horror at a 10, but keeping up in AH doesn't feel like as much work as this one.  Different monsters with different stats, keeping track of hit points, getting pummeled every turn, I don't know, just didn't strike me.  5.

Preordered @ KS. Always Super pledge + Dungeon Tiles: Dungeons of Crystalia + Dungeon Tiles: Von Drakk Ghost House + Claws of the Wyrm + Stilt Town Zombies + Twilight Knight

Sold. It almost never hit the table, wasn't a big hit in the group. Also, solo Arcade mode isn't all that good.

Should probably play it a second time, but the first time it was pretty lackluster. Too much hack&slash, not enough tactics. There are other dungeon crawlers out there that are a lot better in creating tension.

Haven't tried arcane mode yet.

Forgotten King is a standalone game, is compatible with all previously published Super Dungeon Explore expansions and supplements.... and has pre-assembled minis, and the second edition of the rules.

Also consider that you own Arcadia quest - which some would say is a better mini game.

I bought it on second hand because I was not sure about enjoying it. As I was owner of an Arcadia Quest game I thought this would not be so funny but, fortunately, I was wrong. It is a super-fun videogame on board game! 

Maybe many of player are unable to see the potencial this game has. Creating your own cards for heroes and enemies is extremely easy and the arcade mode is a really nice inclusion. If you wanna play videogame without watching a screen, try this!

One of my favorite games, was it only for the miniatures. Granted that I houseruled a lot (I do it with all games) I really enjoy the combat and quick character progression systems. The name of the game is misleading since there is no exploration in the game at all. My comment is referred to th arcade (coop) version of the game, since I generally play solo. Looking forward to the kickstarter material

Shopped around on eBay for months and finally bit the bullet and bought an after-market version with the Boo Booty box on eBay and I'm incredibly glad.  Biggest improvement in the rules was Arcade mode (co-op), which introduced more hero action, and a card-based monster activator.  Loved the game enough that I've picked up most expansions, and am actively supporting the Legends KS through beta testing to provide a more solid rule-set for v.2.0.  An involved game of 3+ hours with setup and clean-up, we try and get in a session at least every two weeks (more if weekend schedules allow).

RATING: 10
This takes the original game and successfully streamlines it into an even more fluid experience. Better miniatures, better boards, better mechanics, this takes everything the original did well and improves it. The addition of arcade mode is fine but it doesn't work as well as the class '1 vs All' style of play.

Kein Dungeoncrawler, dafür im Arcade-Modus ein prima Taktikspiel mit tollen Miniaturen. Einige bemängeln man könnte ewig looten. Meines Erachtens ist es für den Spielsieg aber entscheidend das Spielfeld unter Kontrolle zu behalten und genau im richtigen Moment die Spawnpunkte zu zerstören, damit die Minibosse und der Boss nicht zur Unzeit erscheinen. Und dieses kontrollierte Spiel kann dann echt spannend sein. (Hinweis: Classic-Modus hab ich nie gespielt.)

*地圖先放一塊然後隨機拚第二塊並擲綠骰，根據星號轉幾次90度(愛心則翻面)，放置時們要相接，玩家選擇6張神器寶藏/寶藏怪/模組寶藏卡(王跟小王加入的)跟基本的24張洗云成42張牌庫，48張戰利品卡/24+12(王加入的)張探險卡/36張命令卡各自洗勻，選擇一個邊緣的門口四格內位置放起始標記，所有英雄相鄰該標記放置，每個地圖放一個重生點卡跟寶箱，重生點有符號，重生板塊放置該符號後距離兩個位置放版對應怪物(怪物不相鄰)，寶藏距離重生點4格，每個英雄上方一個藥水標記就可以開始了
*算格子對腳也算

*遊戲從英雄階段開始，之後換怪物階段，每個階段結束都會有力量增強階段，直到玩家打敗大王或是玩家全部掛掉結束

1.力量增強階段 分成四個步驟
>裝備  抽戰利品或寶藏卡(抽完棄牌洗勻再抽)，英雄階段時打掉的每個怪獲重生點可抽一張，總上限三張，小王或寶箱怪打掉的每個可抽一張寶藏卡不管是英雄階段或是怪物階段打死的，每個裝備放在腳色的對應寶石面，每面上限一張，裝備不管腳色位置可自由分配，換掉跟沒裝備的卡要棄掉，如果棄掉寶藏卡可回一血或消除一負面狀態
>神器 每個英雄根據規則使用，無須裝備
>如果打敗小王，提升怪物力量軌，所有王跟野外以外的怪物獲得額外加成
>打暴一個重生點時放一個小王在該重生點上，沒位置放相鄰點，沒得放則提升怪物力量軌，最後一個重生點打暴放大王

2.英雄階段  分別選兩個不同英雄行動，每個英雄行動階段如下

*藍箭頭向上代表只對友方有效，骷顱代表雙方有效，否則只對敵方有效
*腳色身上有藥水上限，英雄回合可使用任意數量，敵人階段只能喝一瓶，每喝一瓶獲得一個仇恨標記，可喝隊友的藥水，並執行隊友卡上行動，跟腳色距離無關
****基本行動*****

>打開寶箱得到2個仇恨值
>打敗小王或是重生點獲得兩點仇恨值
*當有英雄進入新板塊時，抽一張探索卡結算，結算完後再繼續移動
*公主幣在重生點打暴時會放在重生點上，要靠行動拾取
*鑰匙在小王打爆時放在該點上
*獲得的裝備卡都必須先放在共用背包上，只有進入力量提升階段才能裝備

3.怪物階段
>觸發的怪物為英雄板塊上所有跟相鄰一個門板塊上所有
>順位為 野怪>大王>小王>菁英>小怪 並由離仇恨值最高的英雄優先，每類型行動完在換下個類型
>所有怪照上面順序執行維持階段，維持階段同英雄
 >抽命令卡照上面指令動作，如果場上沒有怪則不抽牌直接執行重生行動
>重生 最靠近仇恨值高英雄的重生點重生所有卡片上怪物(供應區有的)，如果有對應該重生點的怪在場上可以除所有負面標記跟受傷，然後該重生點受一點傷害，如果無觸發的重生點，則此行動跳過，如果卡牌沒其他行動可執行則在抽一張
>移動 小怪以外的都往仇恨值高的英雄移動到可攻擊距離，小怪則往對應的菁英怪移動
>獨特行動  照上面順位執行所有怪的獨特行動
*菁英怪有形成群時，獨特行動可能會改執行強力獨特行動，特徵行動也是獨特行動
>戰鬥 小怪不執行，其他則執行普通攻擊，有群的菁英怪執行群攻，如果沒執行獨特行動但怪有特徵行動也會執行，之後才普攻，每一點卡片上行動力執行一次
*菁英怪跟對應的小怪在兩格內時會形成群組，菁英怪屬性看卡片較大那欄，也會獲得小怪的能力，如果收到範圍以外的傷害會由小怪代為承受

*當傷害超過單位生命上限則死亡移除，英雄移除時放一個骷顱標記，上面拾取時可拿走該英雄身上裝備，維持階段時可使用公主幣，1個可以移除任意英雄身上所有狀態跟傷害標記，復活的英雄會在起始點旁，如果骷顱點沒有被拾取，則裝備仍舊在身上

I'm not sure yet what the results here were, but in general I love games that focus on rebalancing and refinement rather than simply adding more stuff. Here the classic system was overhauled a bit to be less fiddly (less unique abilities all over the place, better rules for activation that don't require keeping track of so many figures, etc), overpowered heroes and monsters were nerfed, and underpowered guys were buffed. The classic game was pretty good but needed a bit more time in the oven, so the extra attention for a game that has future expansions in the pipeline is great!

Also new is "Arcade mode" a pure co-op that can be played solo. Not really a fan of co-op solo gaming, and the AI feels a bit fiddly to manage. However, SDE's arcade mode has one supreme advantage over other dungeon crawl coops: it has eliminated die rolls for the "bad guy." SDE's competitors often break the illusion of "player VS AI" by making player not only make choices for AI, but roll the AI's dice! Here the AI just does completely static stuff.

Also notable is that the AI is kinda hard to "game" compared to other systems I've played, though it can be done for sure.

Classic mode is where it's at, with much more interesting tactical and strategic choices and less fiddliness. The AI cannot match a human consul player.

The variety of heroes and monsters is pretty cool once you have a few expansions.

At the end of the day, this game pales in comparison to other dungeon crawlers in key areas -- the immersion and exploration of HeroQuest-style dungeon crawls, the character progression of Descemt=style dungeon crawls, and the depth of gameplay found in more complex combat-based crawlers.

So why then, is it good, rather than mediocre? Because is it unique, satisfying, and can be played without a steady group (no campaign), basically. Also the 16-bit video game theme is endearing to children of the 80-90s.

[hr]Lowered design rating, they streamlined the game but made it kinda worst from a standpoint of the strategies that are employed to win not being fun ones.

(2 Design + 2 Enjoyment) - Arcade Mode (Coop/solo)
(2 Design + 4 Enjoyment) - Classic Mode (1vAll)

I bought this purely for solo play. The minis are great and theres lots of them, though only enough for 4 tiles/heroes. Plenty of map tiles too.
The instructions are long but not the worst I've ever read. Solo gameplay is actually relatively simple.
Overall though it doesnt live up to the implied promise of a fun solo dungeon romp. Dissapointing.

Can't get enough of playing this game.  With the new Arcade mode, nobody has the be the 'bad guy' while exploring a dungeon.  It is simple enough a 6-7 year old can pick up how to play, but challenging enough to entertain adults of any age as well.

Fun to change it up each time we play as with expansions there is a plethora of options for maps, heroes, spawn points, and bosses.

Very nicely designed miniatures as well, that can be used for avatars in others games or can be an added element to the game by painting up your favorite models to play with.

Got this because I loved Arcadia Quest and wanted a similar feel in a co-op game.  This is not it.  This game is an OK hack-slash that takes WAY TOO LONG.  It's not a fun kind of long, it's a "OMG, is something different ever going to happen??" kind of long where players get completely disengaged and can't remember who's turn it is.  Super lame.

Oh yeah, and that's with Classic rules.  The Arcade rules have soooo many exceptions and random rules you have to remember (like the much-too-involved gang mechanic and moving 20 monsters on a single Consul turn) that we never even attempted it.  So much for buying a cute, chibi, co-op dungeon crawl adventure.

I was also really disappointed in the games contents.  The game is made to be played with 3-5 heroes and 3-5 spawn points with 2-4 mini bosses and 1 boss, depending on the number of players (3 heroes with 2 mini bosses; 4 heroes with 3 mini bosses, etc.).  The problem is that the game comes with only FOUR spawn points (when you will need 5 to play with 5 heroes), and TWO mini bosses (when you will neeed 3 or 4 to play with 4 or 5 heroes).  So what are you supposed to do?!  Honestly, it feels like the game is incomplete.  This is VERY disappointing, especially for the $100 price tag!

Arcade (co-op) mode is allright, but classic mode (i.e. playing with a gamemaster) is better. I absolutely love the art direction and overall flavour of the game. But each game (even with just three heroes) is really long, and all the small rules make the level of entry pretty high. So I am not sure how often it will hit the table, even though gameplay and looks are really good.

I just don't enjoy the pace of this game. It's way to slow and way to long. I might be able to house rule it into something fun and unrecognizable, but I don't want to put that kind of work in. Includes all contents from the Forgotten King Kickstarter campaign as well as the bulk hero pack.

Decent tactical combat game with with a cool art style and minis. However, the solo mode feels tacked on and for all its video game referencing it doesn't particularly play like any of the video games it's supposedly inspired by.

Fixed a lot of the issues that were plaguing the original SDE. Rules are better, minis and tiles look great, and the explore deck makes the games even more different from each other.

Bought before I really knew what I liked.

There's no elegance in the game design. What you are doing turn to turn is often not fun. There's not much variety betwen games.

A really strong theme might have saved it, but the game world could have come from a 12 year-old's rpg campaign.

Amazing minis and artwork. Captured that old style gauntlet or LOZ video game feel. Good solid game mechanic. Is let down by lengthy game times with a little variance in gameplay. However there are custom rules known as the lootimeter which significantly speeds things up and adds pressure and variety. Honestly I'd have ranked this as an 8 or 9 if these were the official rules. However as they aren't I have to be more honest with the base game rules. I don't think I'll ever get rid of this game, but I also don't think I'll play with the original ruleset either.

21/05/2016 - Looks good but a bit long winded. Not sure when I'll have the time to play it now so would consider trading for the right game!

29/04/17 - Traded away for sealed copy of Talisman Revised 4th edition in April 2017 UK Maths Trade.

Played game in arcade mode. Was enjoyable and my 10year old daughter loved it too. Not very complex to play, but does take some thought to not have too much come at ya. Some of the arcade cards for the monsters took a min to know who was who...but the classic mode cards helped us know who was who. So if you just start with arcade, might take a sec since some understaning of play comes from classic mode.

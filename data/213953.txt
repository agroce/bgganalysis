I think the idea of this game I like more than the game itself, but I still liked this game a lot. Pyramid Poker is a 2 person game where you each get wooden blocks with the standard 52 card deck printed on them. There's 2 main phases: 1st you take turns building a pyramid by placing tiles so you can see what card it is, until you each run out. 2nd, you each take turns grabbing a tile that is eligible (nothing on to of it) and placing it in one of your 3 poker hands, until you each have your 3 poker hands. Then the hands compete and the winner of 2/3 wins.

I knew going into it that a lot of this game was about playing your opponent rather than trying to stick with your known tiles, but I was mildly disappointed to learn that it is about 75% reading what your opponent wants to take and 25% taking stuff you know you want.

Still it's very enjoyable and perhaps playing with different people will feel much more different.

really neat light idea. Probably perfect to play with non gamers. And the pieces are nice and chunky!

While I dislike actual poker, I seem to enjoy variants that utilize poker hand structure. Games like this and Battle Line make great use of building multiple hands of poker in a head-to-head match up. Pyramid Poker is so simple, yet it features just enough of a wrinkle to engage the ol' brain cells. I always play with the advanced scoring.

Nice two player game! The right mix of strategy and luck and you can play a game in 10 or 15 minutes.

Quick two-player poker dueler. I liked the '11-point' system better that we used on the second play. I can see on repeated plays this would get down a bit more to luck, but als really trying to get into the head of your opponent and figure out what they have placed.

RATING: 5
A decent game of drafting hands from a pyramid of tiles, where you can see half the tiles, and your opponent can see the other half. Every time you draft a tile, you allocate it to one of three poker hands you're building, which are going head to head against the three hands your opponent is building. Some times you'll pull blind if you don't like what you see hoping for the best, or will draft a tile in order to better set yourself up or hate draft on your opponent.

Not super engaging, but I can see this being a good pub game that you could play casually while chatting and having a few drinks.

I love the Mahjong-like, limited information system, and how many layers of strategy it can have. I love the scoring system, which can make any tile useful in the right situation, and the same tile useful for both players. I love that you need to win 2 out of 3 hands, so that if your opponent starts stacking one, you can dump your trash (hopefully also their treasure) there and build two which are strong enough. I love how if you gain information on what they're trying to do while they're doing it, and how the hand-ranking limits the possible outcomes. I love the rush of leaving a perfect tile for your opponent, because they don't know it is.

That all of that fits in 10 minutes is insane to me.

I like the thick wooden blocks and building the wall. Overall, I'd rather play other card games like Tichu. I guess I've just moved on from Poker hands. Cool gimmick though.

Piqued my interest since it reminds me a bit of Battle Line (using poker hands to win match ups), is cheap, and has hefty enough components that it can be played outside.  

I'm only a handful of plays in, but right now, it's not quite as tense as Battle Line.  However, there will be moments when you pull one of your opponent's blocks and will be hoping for the best, which gives nice suspenseful moments.  There are interesting decisions to make, especially if you're playing with scoring (my preferred method).  What kind of hands are you trying to make out of the blocks you can see?  Are there certain areas your opponent doesn't appear to be pulling from?  Why?  Are they bluffing on it not being a good block for them/you?  Or is it a block they don't want to commit to yet until they see which other blocks they can gain?  Scoring adds in additional decisions.  Do you go for an easy win on one of your hands, but it won't net you many points?  Or push for a stronger hand, which will be worth more points, but could blow up and cost you the win for that hand if your opponent takes a vital block.

Not bad at all for a 15-minute filler.  There are a few Battle Line type decisions to make when building your hands, along with knowing when to gamble on a hidden tile versus taking your own, when to expose a tile on the next row, etc.  I'm not sure how much strategy there is in the "building the pyramid" phase.  I tried to put tiles on the bottom that could work for a couple different types of hands, depending on what I grabbed higher up on the pyramid.  Rating will not go down and might go up if the advanced version is interesting (we just played for most hands won the first time through).  I can see this working as a gambling game with a beer in hand.

Played prototype. Great fun, fast paced, and suspenseful.

Not a poker game per se, it just borrows the hand-building ideas of poker.

Great tactile feel, and look on the table.

Placing blocks one by one into a pyramid form facing your pieces towards yourself. Then later you will use those pieces to form poker hands trying to out smart your opponent. the building of the pyramid is kinda gimmicky and not really needed. I like the quality of the blocks, but if you end up playing this a lot you will start to recognize the darker ones might be kings and queens etc. not consistent in the coloring of the blocks.

The chunky wood pieces are a nice change over the fiddliness of forming a card pyramid (I'm looking at you 7 Wonders Duel) and perfect for allowing you to see your pieces a la block wargames, but that's about all this has going for it.  It's just too light, how you place your own pieces is not all that important, it's more about randomly grabbing some of the unknown opponent's pieces and then trying to time it so that you'll be able to grab your own known pieces to form the best poker hands.  The "advanced game" with scoring seems pointless, unless I guess you're going to track your score and play for highest total score over many rounds. It's light and fast, but bulky, and it's got nothing on similar small package card games like Battle Line/Schotten Totten.

The game is pretty clever. You first decide how to group your tiles, and then take them apart and play it to one of three hands, that are then compared at the end of the game.

This is a very fun 3-hand poker variant! It's got some pretty awesome wooden tiles that feel nice in your hands! There are 54 tiles: 52 standard cards + 2 jokers. Shuffle everything face down, deal each player 15 tiles. Alternate turns: draw a single tile, then place it to build a pyramid (base 8 tiles wide). The value faces you so that each player only knows the value of the tokens they placed. When all tiles are up, alternate taking a tile from the top; when chosen, immediately place face up into one of 3 hands. At the end, whoever wins 2/3 hands wins the game! 

Really fun, with appropriate tension and speed of play.

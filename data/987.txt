A little to "old school" for my tastes. I very much enjoy the historical period but the game play was a bit clunky and graphics were marginal (though acceptable for their times). Sold it. (I did own the PC version and got some play out of that.)

Played once with three players. AH edition.

Awfull components, horrible map! The game map is the worst I've ever played!
A game of the prehistoric era of boardgaming.
Probably the experience could improve with more plays (but I donÂ´t care any more).  Previous knowledge of the effects of event cards and plagues can reduce the randomn and luck of the game.

Back in 1982, I had two wargames, but I wouldn't really call myself a wargamer back then.  Then a buddy introduced me to this and Star Fleet Battles and it changed my life forever.

People will say what they are going to say about this game, but the few times I have played against opponents I chalk up to some of the best gaming experiences of my life.  I love the chaos and I love the planning.  It is an excellent game that has aged better than many of its peers.

How does one review a game great for its time, but now difficult to play?  I've noticed that sticking to the descriptive criteria used at BGG makes my gradings of older games separate out bimodally.  Kingmaker is a highly original game but I don't think I'll ever vote to play it again.

I like the idea and concept, the rules, map and pieces are a little quirky sometimes.  The random events can take you from top to tbottom in one draw of the cards.  House rules usually fix these problems.  
It think this game would be great if it was updated and the rules re-written.  (hello WOTC anyone there?) As the rule book reads in the second edition with the three levels of play, the added rules just made it more complex.

Breakthrough concept in it's time, KM is somewhat dated today. Incomprehensible map and confusing rules mar an interesting, often aggravating multiplayer experience. Too long, too messy, but still a sentimental favorite. Points for the theme, true to the title: you aren't a royal, but a noble. Princes and princesses exist to impose your will on other nobles, and are discarded or destroyed for your own ignoble ends. Long Live the Kingmaker!

Excellent game, but can be hampered by mid-game territoriality, inducing a stalemate. AH version introduces voting in Parliament, both Lords & Commons, plus a sort-of tactical system to resolve battles.

I loved Kingmaker back in the day when all we had was AH and we didn't know any better. The game has wonderful historical flavor and color, but once you get past the excitement of the initial rounds, you realize that the game mechanics are flawed on too many levels. By mid-game, there's not alot of opportunity for fortunes to change short of the other player doing something really stupid.

There seems to be a good game in here, but it was difficult for me to enjoy it due to the quality of the production based on 1970s standard. I'd like to try it again with an updated version.

The first advanced board game I ever owned, I sadly have to rate it this low because of the complexity and number of rules situations that aren't addressed in the rule book. It also can lead to a stalemate situation and eventually success ends up being reliant on totally random card draws such as a plague killing off your opponent.

I'd love to see a modern redesign with an improved rulebook though...

Good multiplayer, diplomacy, simple wargame. Don't stick in too many advance rules and variants and you'll be fine.  Boring with 2 people, ok with three, REALLY shines with 7. Watch those factions, split, war and rejoin as they try to get their heir on the throne.   Even non wargamers/thinkers tend to like this one.

I've got both the Avalon Hill "bookshelf" version and the original Ariel/Philmar one.  AH should never have shrunk the board the way they did.  They vastly improved the graphics on the cards, however.  I can't believe how utterly primitive the Ariel ones are by comparison.  Best bet is to combine the board from Ariel with the cards/pieces from AH.

Ah, a classic Avalon Hill game! Kingmaker sees players controlling factions in the War of the Roses which move around the board claiming heirs, having wars, running home for revolts, avoiding the plague and so on, with the aim of being the one to get the final heir crowned king. 

Negociation and treachery form part of the game as well, which explains why the game I polayed with a bunch of gusy who'd just finished a Dip game took quite so long ;-)

A great looking game when it came out in the mid 70's and it contained some really interesting ideas: Nobles with titles and troops vying for power and influence during the "War of the Roses" in Britain.

I find this game to be a a lot of fun.  I enjoy the struggle to control the heirs and the wild twists of fate (like rea life) and, unlike some others here at the geek, I DO like luck elements in my games!  The game does a nice job of giving a feel of the power politics of the day and how the positions in England reflected that struggle.  This is one of those games I play at least once a year.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This one is a tough one for me to rate, as I think the diplomacy outweighs the strategy of it. It's simple enough that you can learn to play it fast. The kicker is, you might have your strategy down, about to win, and a card comes up, that causes your whole game to change by loosing some of your biggest nobility. That does add, a "you never knew what hit you" to the punch, which is good. If you hate a random element, you may hate this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game that was decent, even good in the '70s, but I remain shocked (and vaguely appalled) that people still invest time and effort into this outdated and, in truth, uninteresting game.

Still, all told, Kingmaker is a classic and it does try to address some of the problems inherent in the multplayer free-for-all type wargames. While it doesn't totally succeed, and it does have a fair number of other problems, nontheless it at least tried. Many more modern games are not even trying. For fans of today's games like Twilight Imperium or Conquest of the Empire II, this is worth going back to once, just to see the way it works the problems. Every time I play another uninspired game like Antike, Conquest of the Empire, A Game of Thrones, or whatever, I wonder: have these designers played the classics? Kingmaker, Dune, Titan, Civilization? These old games are from a different time, a time when (apparently) we had a lot more time, but they are otherwise good designs which demonstrated that the problems with this genre have been understood for a long time, and there was a time when people made an honest attempt to address them. If only I could say the same thing for today's American designers.

Nowhere near the '7' difficulty rating advertised. If Storm Over Arnhem was a '4' then Kingmaker should have been a '3'! This game's good fun if you can come to blows with your opponent. The trouble is everyone refuses to leave Cornwall / The Western Marches / London or cross the River Trent to do battle so it becomes  bogged down. There are now some extra event cards (originally from AH's General magazine) and rule sets available in the files section that improve the endgame. It would be nice to see this reprinted with these 'fixes' as options.

Is it a fantastic game?  Perhaps not.  But if you're young, with a girlfriend and a roommate to play this with, I bet you will have a great time with this game. 

As a side benefit, when I took a trip to Britain a few years later, I knew where everything was!

By modern day standards this game is rather flawed.  It was probably flawed back then but somehow we didn't care.

Haven't played this game in 20+ years, but it will hit the table this year as my current group is interested in revival of this game.

Updated:  We played this game again a few months ago; first play in many years for all of us.  It was a long brutal battle.  We plan to play again sometime next year.  Kingmaker seems like a once a year game.

This was a game I loved to play and was one of my favorites, but unfortunately sold while in college. A game which can play rather deceptively, contains much screwage - yet I never played with anyone who felt badly treated or was upset after the game. 

While a long game, I find the complexities to be engaging and never felt the downtime was too much. I tend to think this as an under-appreciated classic.

Fun, both strategically and for the little history lesson in it. But it does have its downsides. Notably on the version we had (1981 revision) the map numbering did not correspond to the cards numbering so it was extremely difficult to find cities when you aren't familiar with England's layout. Secondly, though it can be played with two players, the game becomes overly simplified.

That and a dog somehow chewed our Archbishop of Canterbury card, rendering it useless.

(2009-05-25) Today Ken, Pete and I met at Bud's house and we eventually decided upon Kingmaker.

After the first hour I was thinking "interesting mechanics... a couple of things I would do differently next time..."

After three hours I was thinking "Hmm. I'm not sure I'm following. How does one win this game?"

After five hours I was thinking "Uh, how do we end this game?"

The mechanics of battles and sieges take away from the gameplay, as we ended up launching one-against-many assaults in the hope of drawing a favorable mortality chit for an enemy noble.  The era and cards are just too cool for words, though.  With the proper house rules, I think this game would absolutely rock.

Avalon Hill.  The base game is so-so and needs use of the extras Avalon Hill came out with in The General.  With a lot of house rules like 4 hour time limit for the game and "not being able to hide off map" for most of the game - the game can be made into a fun game.  My big issue with the game is that everyone seems to play Kingmaker differently.  Others complain about the luck element, but I call it Controlled Chaos.  My group plays with all of the expansion cards that came with the Kingmaker Variant by Avalon Hill which makes the game much more interesting and playable.

Avalon Hill 1st Edition

As you can tell, I have a lot of Kingmakers. Between forgetting about an Ebay ordering Robot I turned loose and NEVER leaving on the shelves of the Goodwill, I have probably more than I need. This is the Kingmaker I play these days. The cards are a bit of a pain (Impossible to shuffle) and the board is rather small compared the the Ariel, Gibson, and 2nd Avalon Hill but certainly still playable. Also can be picked up for cheap on Ebay and the like.

Avalon Hill 2nd Edition

I have one of these versions as well and the larger board is really nice. The rules have been tweaked a bit also, so it is possible to play a game in an hour if you want. You still get the unshuffleable cards, and the box art is kinda lame.

Ariel Games 1st Edition

This is my first memory of a Wargame, actually purchased by my brother on a walk to Coventry during a Summer stay with my Grandmother. Half the fun of the game was assembling your forces in the beginning of the game then clobbering your opponent (or getting clobbered) (or more likely plagued or "Sent to the Northers Marches") 
Someone needs to Kickstarter this thing!

It's fairly easy to get into play quickly. Probably best with 4 or 5 players. Each player has a number of nobles in his faction. Nobles may acquire titles, offices, mercenaries, bishops, towns and/or ships. A faction's goal is to control the last surviving heir from the House of Lancaster or York. Players draw event cards which may require nobles to move all over the board to respond to  raids or revolts. Plague randomly strikes cities, wiping out any nobles or royals occupying them. Combat resolution is very simplistic.

First exposed to this in college (about 1980). I loved this game, played it tons, created new cards, tried out variants, ran tournaments.

Sadly, most of my friends do not have the enthusiasm for the game (time being the big factor) and it has been a while since it has seen play.

Fun game, if people can agree on the meaning of the rules.  I find the rules vague and confusing.  When I play the game with new people who have experience with the game I always seem to learn new rules or find contradictions on how other groups play it.  I owned a computer version of Kingmaker that was fun to play, but I haven't found the floppies to re-install it (if it would even work on current systems anyways).

Fun game, interesting mechanics, but in practice the game almost never ended. Invariably someone would end up with Captain of Calais + Warden of the Cinque Ports and hide in Calais until everyone else died of the plague. Or he died of the plague.

I was lucky to have a veteran teach me, but I can see how it would be confusing if everyone was new.  A fun, but occasionally frustrating game.  The card draws can drive you nuts (as you watch someone else load up with four nobles and tons of lands and titles as your troops recover from the plague), but there's enough swings of fortune (plagues and getting your forces called 'home') and diplomacy to keep powerful players under control.  I enjoyed it and would like to try it again.

This old Avalon Hill war game is one that non-gamers can play. Even though the basic game takes 3 rule pages of tight text, the play is straight forward and not complicated. 

It can go on a long time. We played with 5, and one person had most of the Archbishops and Bishops (needed to coronate the king), yet didn't have a lord (needed to get the king). The game went on for about 3 hours before a King was coroneted and only then because I gave a Bishop to a player with the heir (King Maker!).

A very chaotic game because the draw of the cards can send a lord anywhere and the plague can wipe a player out. With 5 people it was very rare that plans were carried out.

Excellent historical game and map of old England.

It was enjoyable. Would like another game or two soon, then probably not play for awhile.

Never played the advanced rules but remember the devastating plagues and the long lulls when everyone retires to their castle.  I guess someone who never had their entire army wiped out by a random event can understand how it feels to have played 3 hours to perish to a purely uncontrollable factor.  But once this happens, the impression of wasted time comes home.  As the name implies, there are many ways to be a Kingmaker.  An introduction to many of personal pet peeves with games can be experienced with this game.

This game is a bit odd.  I like the theme and some of the mechanics, but being an older design is suffers from a number of problems: turtling, gathering all forces together and just sitting in stalemate, etc.

Es un buen juego de mesa. No es, a mi entender, un wargame en el sentido estricto aunque tiene batallas. Es un gran juego politico y diplomatico que gana mucho si juegan 5 personas.

La partida puede durar unas 10 horas, aunque si todos los jugadores son buenos y rapidos puede ser bastante mas moderado el tiempo.

War of the Roses in a good way. With Kingmaker you learn english geography, History and heraldry. Good looking game with a double rules system (easy and hard) that takes four or six hours playing and is tremendous funny.

Not complex at all and full of changes thatnk's to the event cards and the "king's involuntary movements".

I own the Gibson Games version c. 1983. Appears terrifyingly complex at first, with obscure and apparently contradictory rules. A multitude of tiny cardboard tokens is rather worrying too. Very long-winded preamble (dressing the board etc.) Only managed one (2-player) game.  From an already weak starting position, my nobles were further depleted by unlucky random events (invading Scots slaughtering my best placed Earl), giving my opponent an unassailable position. Long drawn-out and painful ending.Seems too dry and heavyweight for my tastes, but may try again with some of the rules clarifications.

A very frustrating game!! Some of the ideas behind the game are good, but I found it very unfulfilling to play, partly because just as you're getting somewhere you get completely wiped out by plague, or something else equally as nasty. This could have been a very good game, but it isn't!!!

This one, the whole family played a couple times.  We lived in Britain for a couple years in the early 80's so it captured our interest at that time.  We went on many road trips to see some of the surviving castles that were featured in the game.

Game starts off interesting, everyone fighting over heirs and castles. But then the suck factor kicks in. Everyone moves to their turtle shells...er...castles and waits. Then random even cards make nobles fly/beam across the country. If one pops up in the wrong spot you go kill him and you hope you kill or capture an heir. After the first 2 gos or so it feels like very slow fuedal themed version of Hungry Hungry Hippos. You stick your neck out and try to gobble up a stray heir. Aweful!

678/ The War of the Roses: sounds somewhat like a pillow-fight. Right? Wrong! For 40 years the entire country of England was engaged in a brutal fight to have the noble heir of their region inherit the crown. In our civil war,we are still writing and talking about it; and it only lasted 5 years.

I can see potential for this game; it tells a good story, it's important to be able to strategize in a way which can deal with random events, the potential for alliances and negotiation is always good, and holding back strength till it can be used decisively should make for an interesting game.
But, it takes too long for what it is, and often there doesn't seem to be much to do other than gather strength and wait for an opportunity-- which gets dull after an hour or two, or three.

Nice game. It captures perfectly the feeling of struggle in times of great uncertainty.

If you don't know the game, it may feel very random, while if you know it, you have to carefully ponder your chances as little can make or undo a realm. 

I don't know for replayability, but this game can drag along a lot, there is no quick and easy way to shorten its length.

Great simulation of the War of the Roses.  Traitorous nobles, plagues, and random events can quickly take you from being in top position to royally (pun inteded) screwed.  But that's how it was back then.  Play a faction of nobles who picks a royal heir to champion and you have to eliminate all the rest of the family(ies).  Richard the III in a boardgame.  Only for historically interested, and heavier gamers or wargamers.

Great fun to play.  A decent combination with enough strategizing to keep the wargamers happy, and some random events/politicking for the non-wargaming crowd.  Played this one A LOT, as my friend's and mine girlfriends thoroughly enjoyed the backstabbing and negotiations; also they could by good card play beat the "wargamers".  The computer version was also pretty darn good (probably the best of the AH computer line).  Highly recommend the "new" variant cards.  A keeper.

This used to be 'THE' political strategy game that all others were compared to.  Compared to more modern offerings, however, Kingmaker looks clunky and overly complex.  The random element tends to overshadow strategy, but strategy is still important to victory.  In my opinion, Warrior Knights is a better game, but mainly due to luck playing a lesser role.

A couch potato's dream as the player who does the least often ends up with the most. But more bizarrely, it has had an insidious influence on simulation gaming because it turned a (then) promising designer to the Dark Side. In a tragically prolific career, almost every one of his efforts since then has been regurgitated Kingmaker, a yukky blend of chrome, chaos and cheese. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I can't fail to love this one still even though the end is tooo long! Encouraging people to be ruthless speeds up the game, as does setting a time limit when it gets near the end. Be selective with the AH advanced rules, they often create more problems than needed (e.g. parliament, battle) The variant cards from 'The General' only help to lengthen the game!

I want to like this game.  I've only played the basic game.  It seems overly long and a bit random for strategy and the board could be easier to use.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Although well thought of at the time of its release, this game simply serves as a reminder of why today's games are so good. An interesting theme is thrown away on a game that immediately goes into stalemate, as players bag one of the royals, then hide (Carisbrooke castle on the Isle of Wight was my favourite) and wait for the others to die. Fiddly cardboard chits are manoeuvred on an over-crowded board that gives no incentive for battle, while the action is provided by random event cards: "Oh look, my army just died of plague!". Never again.

I've played this a few times.  I found the rules take a bit to learn but once learned, it's a pretty entertaining game.  There's a lot of random factors that can affect you but gradually, you learn that how you handle the randomness is big part of your skills.  I found this game is best played in a quiet, unassuming way.  Being too obvious too soon will usually spell doom for your side.

Found my copy in a thrift shop . . . in shrink.  Look forward to playing it someday.

UPDATE:  More old-school Avalon Hill goodness.  The detail that went into incorporating much of the real history of the time period is impressive.  However, many of the real mechanics that were incorporated make the game a bit "swingy" . . . one minute, you are busy nabbing all the heirs to the throne . . . the next minute, 3/4 of you nobles die to an outbreak of plague or your best noble randomly dies in an battle in which you have overwhelming odds - losing not only his services, but also his title, office and armies of dudes.

Would play this again . . . just need to be realistic that the 'experience' factors may outweigh skill.

I played the Ariel version back in the mid-80s. I always liked the strong historical theme, but it was never my choice of game as I was always beaten by a more experienced opponent (generally the game's owner, now a professional historian). The event pack added a lot of flavour, but also the annoying embassies and random noble deaths. Movement was always a pain unless you were very familiar with the board. Although lacking the historical feel, Warrior Knights was a better game. If I wanted to delve back into 80s gaming, I'd try that first. 
UPDATE: I tried Kingmaker again. The main problem with the game is that it can really drag out - it is interesting enough for a couple of hours but there is no mechanism to keep the game relativaly short.

This period of time interests me, and I love the intrigue. Kingmaker captures the turbulence, but the game play is limited and the mecahnics are weak. The board and cards are cool. I'll play this for the "simulation", but not as anything intellectually satisfying. Those who really get into the diplomatic aspect of a game might like this one, but I'd argue that's it hard to have leverage with a much weaker army. And I never thought I'd say it, but, I like lopping off heads.

It won't hit the table for quite awhile (nor all that often), but it sure does live up to its theme.

Sprawling game with nice historical colour but a lot of card driven events wrecking your strategy. I guess knowing the event cards and doing a bit of card counting would help, but it can develop into a stalemate situation with armies hiding out in plague-resistant castles for fear of venturing forth and catching the pox.

Really enjoyed this "different" style Avalon Hill game, which I played mid-1970's into the early 1980's.

I love this game with the standard rules (with or without the expansion deck).  When the advance parliament rules are added, it ruins the game for me.

Well-played, used condition.  Variant deck included.  Early edition small map.  Extra rules (2nd edition) included. Also, extra Crown Deck and extra counter sheet included.  Copies of various articles and clarifications.

Another old favourite I played tons in the old days and have returned to recently after a long hiatus.

I know it has a number of flaws but I love the historical background and the theme with all the heraldic shields and castles. 

This is partly because I am English so I can actually visit a lot of the places depicted in the game.

This rating is based on the somewhat simpler Ariel edition. 
We played this a lot in the late 70's when the main alternatives were Diplomacy and Monopoly. While it's showing its age now and all of your prospects can be flushed down the toilet on the turn of card, it still has some charm. That randomness also gives a sense of what it must be like to have tried to survive through the brutality of the Middle Ages. If it reliably played to a completion in 3 hours it would be a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
By far, this is the most blood-thirsty wargame on the Royal political in-fighting on the British history. This games teaches Royal Houses, regional military manuvering, political shuffling...  I own a PC version of the game. The computer version AI is a hell of a tough nut to crack! Of course, it cheats, but in a subtle way that you probably won't find it. You are difficult to advance on all fronts on the island of Britannia. The AI would have luck on its side raising an army call when you are generally doing well. More bloody and lengthier gameplay than the actual boardgame play I suspect. On many occasions you will find the whole royal family members get beheaded, fairly quick. Choose your house wisely early in the game with positional advantages. The center part of Britannia has an inland advantage but more easily attacked from all sides.  The peripheral regions can be safer but it is less maneuverable than the central powers.  

I got a lot of fun while playing the PC version. It is certainly one of the best computer version of an actual boardgame both true to the spirit and to the actual play. I am sure the fun amount can be even more when playing the game with multiplayers.

If you have the right group of people, this can be a lot of fun.  You can get into the role-playing of building up a feifdom and the shifting alliances.

I doubt I have played any single game, more often. Kingmaker is elegantly simple, but hard to win if your opponents are savvy and exploit your weaknesses whilst using their strengths. 
The play mechanics of the constant circulation of the title of deceased nobles ensures constant surprises and means that even a player, losing disastrously in battle, is far from finished.

One of the classics.  Played a lot in the 1970s.  But, nostalgia aside, it is not as good as most modern themed games.  The event deck system is very flawed and gets predictible with more plays.  Game generally stalemates, possibly for hours before it is broken generally by a random event.  Still, it was fun back in those days and I might play it at a con or once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Since adding in the variant cards, the games have become a lot more enjoyable.  There's some luck with the initial distribution, and if someone happens to get Percy, Neville and Mawbry, you feel like starting over. Death in battle has a habit of striking at the exact wrong time, thus creating a lot of memorable moments of gaming. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
2 / 5 - Fair.

A nice idea but IMHO badly executed. In my experience games almost always arrive at mid-point with everyone clustering stacks of knights with their favoured royal candidate in a city and hoping the plague doesn't strike. From there until the endgame is just interminable tedium.

This game got played a lot in the 1990's.  I never see it getting played any more.  The game was nice looking with all the different coats of arms for the different royal families.  There was a great deal of luck involved in the game.  You could be doing well and then suddenly find one of your best nobles being called to a part of the country where he is vulnerable.  A great deal also depended on what cards you were dealt.  You could get real powerful nobles and important titles or you could get real wimpy nobles and other weak cards.  This is a game I would like to play some time for nostalgic reasons.

Still a pretty interesting game that at one time was at the top of the list of multi-player games.  With so many other choices now Kingmaker is down the list, but is still worth playing. The game, however, towards the end can get a bit repetitive and I've seen a few groups struggle to complete it.

Broken game. Randomness takes a high place in the game, more than I like it. For most of time tou walk with your armies through the board waiting for a chanche of defeating enemies; often this happens when a powerful lord has to come home, leaving alone the weakened rest of his army.
To be a war game, battles are very unlikely to happen because to attack with some victory chance you have to outnumber your opponent; even worser, wen you fight a battle you have a chance of lose one (or more) lords you control, weakening your army
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
High marks for being ahead of its time and flavorful.  Extremely fun game with many variants, victory conditions and ways to play.  I love the calculated risks and wild swings of fortune.  A lot to explore.  Some variant events are essential to prevent stalemate and speed the game along (i.e. plague in calais, gales at sea, royal death, refuge, vacillation).  Unless of course you play to a shorter time limit for VP.

second ed. with full set of variant event cards.

I remember this as a great game although it is probably a bit dated now. Great historical 'feel', but games can drag on for a long time. Also, Kingmaker is what I call a really 'open' game, in that you can add house rules without really affecting the playability too much. (eg sinking of ships at sea, different methods of enacting the plague etc) Maybe Fantasy Flight could revamp it for the 21st Century.

Update: Up for trade.And TRADED!  Waiting for CoR!

Fantastic conceptual design but it needs a COMPLETE overhaul now.  There have been so many cool variants and variant cards posted for this, it's starting to have its own library of variants.  Too many of my games have been marred by cowards hiding in the Continent or by a broken endgame with stacks of nobles.  FFg or Valley games, let's get to it!

I never got the grip of this game. Beautiful chits with coats of arms played on a terrible map with irregular squares. Fierce encounters between the players but completely random allocation of the objectives of the game, the throne pretenders. I won my only game but the game nevertheless felt unsatisfactory.

Update: Sold because the decisions of the game felt pointless and nobody has been inclined to give it another chance.

Groundbreaking for it's day (1974).  But way too random to take seriously as a game in this day and age.  Very unfortunate, because in many ways this game was quite innovative and could have been a quite brilliant game.

This was a great favorite of mine as a teenager. I have many fond memories of weekend-long sessions of playing this with my sister.

RATING: 10
One of the finest games ever made.  The movement system seems a bit clunky these days (particularly given the over-reliance on point-to-point systems now) but it accurately reflects travel across England and gives the game a period feel.  Re-playability is exceptionally high, with each game being a bit different.  The advanced rules make combat even more exciting, but the crux of the game isn't the combat, it is the acquisition of resources in an ever-changing political/factional struggle.

RATING: 5
This old Avalon Hill game is a historical piece on the War of the Roses, where one plays nobles onto the map, get royal heirs and try to have sole king at the end. Battles and seiges resolved by card draw. I've played this many times when I was young, but the game typically gets too unbalanced, with large luck of the draw of cards and the random event cards break up people's forces so that they can be attacked. Long game where one's fortunes are cyclical. In the early 80's when I first played this, I guess that was what was expected of "war games" and there were not that many of them. I did like reading the historical references in the rulebook, and like reliving the history of that period, though.

Loved it at the time, now regard it as a huge bore. Some advanced rules and cards improve things, most don't. In the endgame boils down to whose King or heir is drawn away from their safe house first - a lottery. Many games end with undeserved winners and does not reward good play - it is who loses first not who tried to win.

First - the good.  The game is beautifully done with an interesting set of mechanics.  The player interaction is high, the tension is similar, and the options extensive.

Now - the bad.  The mechanics range from great to "Wha?" in terms of figuring out how to play them.  Many of the options and advanced rules don't add significantly to the game play.  Finally, the victory conditions are relatively awful and there are situations that can arise that result in a horrid stalemate or make the game nigh on impossible for anyone to win.  Throw in the potential length and this sounds like a dog.

But it's not.  The game with the basic rules and appropriate selections from the Advanced and Optional rules is a hoot to play and no player is ever really out of it.  Indeed, players that look completely dead can make stunning comebacks and become a factor (or a victor) out of nowhere.  The one issue that is very, very difficult to overcome is the problem of length - the game can take far too long to finish, and the conclusion when that happens can be very anti-climactic.

Still, it's high on the play list and is typically a very good time.

This used to be my all-time favourite game. I can remember the excitement when the Avalon Hill version was announced - and the disappointment at seeing the smaller, duller board. One legacy of having played this game so much is that I can still, to this day, identify most Medieval English heraldic shields. I suppose there must be worse signs of a mis-spent youth.

The daughter of the game's creator says that her father has given permission to someone to work on a 21st Century re-release - so perhaps this game will get the treatment given last year to Colditz.

This version of the game introduced a number of optional rules, which arguably overcomplicate the simpler but very playable original. In particular, there are new rules for combat, which were designed, I guess, to appeal to AH's core wargaming audience.

Kingmaker is one of those games that can be a lot of fun, but can also be frustrating. The basic premise is that each player controls a faction vying for control of England. The early part of the game is spent recruiting new nobles to your cause and racing to collect the various heirs to the throne. Once all heirs are accounted for, the game reverts to warfare mode. To win the game you must be the last player possessing an heir to throne, and then successully crown that heir. I like the game because it is fairly easy to play, and things tend to move along very quickly. However, there is a lot of luck involved since nobles and titles are usually distributed through random card draws, and event cards drawn each round can have devestating effects. I once had 90% of my force wiped out by a plague early in the game and had to play out the last hour with no chance of winning. Out three player games also seem to end in a statemate a lot.

I had trouble rating this one.  Luck plays too big a part of the game and the end game drags.  On the other hand, we have had a lot of fun playing this game.
The major problem is that random events make your nobles teleport around the board.  This encourages you to divide up the troops so no one noble is vital to your force.  But the advance combat rules make it so that you WANT to put all the troops on one noble in order to break the enemies line.  
I also spend some effort to clear good sections the road network.  That gives me a big advantage in getting my forces back together quickly.
I use the expanded event deck so nobles spend less time teleporting about.
I would recommend you use the alternate rule that you can use a WRIT card to send another force >= to yours to deal with an attack or revolt. 
If you want to enjoy this game you must understand that luck is very important so don't obsess if some bad event loses the game for you.  On the other hand, the higher level of luck encourages non-wargamers to play (they actually have a chance to win). 
I once did a politics based RPG which used a Kingmaker like system for mass combat.

CLASSIC WEURO FROM A TIME WHEN THERE WERE NO EUROS
I purchased this one around 1980, read the rules, and realized my high school gaming buddies were not ready for this one.  Flash forward nearly 30 years to 2009 - I am on a mission to revisit some of my oldest unplayed games.  I picked Kingmaker because of the intersting theme (War of the Roses) and the fact that it supports 2-7 players.  After working through the rules (only 10 pages some will say - what they dont say it is three columns of 6 point type (yikes, where are my glasses) - if this were a 2009 rulebook I'm guessing it would run to 20 pages) I thought we had a really interesting game and decided I would abuse my power as host-for-the-week and inflict it on my Thursday night gaming group. 

So far I have played one game with the basic rules with four experienced gamers that have never played Kingmaker before.  I will withhold judgment until we play another game but the recurring criticism of the game bogging down into an extended stalemate was very much in evidence during our play.  Two of the players (myself included) got beat up fairly early in the game and were knocked of serious contention early on, never to recover.  The other two players grew very strong but not strong enogh to deliover a decisive punch.  After four hours we threw in the towel, conceding victory to the strong player that was in control of the senior Lancastrian heir.

I hope to play it again using the advanced battle rules and perhaps some of the add on events cards that purportedly accelerate the end game.  I am pretty sure that I will avoid a second playing with the straight Basic Rules.

A perfect example of the type of games that I started out playing in the eighties and nineties ... and that's not the 1880's and 90's!  Intense, loads of rules, takes ages to play and very heavy going when compared to the Eurogames of today.  Having said that, Kingmaker is full of period flavour, contains loads of strategy, is thought provoking and is, in fact, a cracking game!

Great game! Must be played with optional rules, and cards that are designated as triggers for the event deck to shuffle. This will eliminate plague-proof cities. Don&#039;t hesitate to form alliances (optional rule) to chase someone of greater strength, and release midgame stalemate.  I enjoy the diplomacy and parliament aspects, and feel the best games have fewer battles.

Played only once, and not till the end. Did not overly appeal to me, but this might be due to the fact my only noble was killed early on, and I was "out of the game" for several turns. Read some comments here on BGG on the game, and I think I agree with the general opinion. Nice but not that good!

Classic wargame on the Wars of the Roses hat sufferes from a curious problem.  The best way to win is often the least fun.

The game is much more fun when you throw caution to the wind, hamming it up as an English noble, killing off useless heirs to the throne with abandon.  Unfortunately, you lose to plodding strategic players.

Chaotic game. Encourages making a big stack of units, but event cards send individual nobles around the board. Be ready to take advantage of tactical situations. Holding crown cards for surprise and trading is a must. Played by the WBC tournament rules.

This game is more about the historical recreation than about playability. I like that so it gets a higher rating than it probably deserves. It's possible for the game to drag on without conclusion as you just cycle through the cards. Better with a lot of players so alliances are required. But lots of neat trivia about the War of the Roses.

I've only play this one once.  The game play seemed to me too complicated and non sense in occasions, the rule book wasn't clear enough and it was as ugly as the components, and the game took forever.  Nevertheless, I have to give this game a new opportunity, cause it left me with the taste that it's an OK game, if approached properly.

RATING: 6
Kingmaker, for a game with a reasonably small rule book, we ran into one dilemma after another.  My friends and I got together 4 different nights to see if we could polish out the rules.  After the second night we added some house rules, after the third, we added the variant cards I found on E-Bay.  Things got better but for every odd situation we solved a new one would pop up.  We spent so much time discussing rules, finally, we just burned out.  The games we had were fun, long, and cut throat, but too much time was spent trying to answer questions and less time just playing.

RATING: 6
One of the Great Three from Avalon Hill that I played a lot in high school and college.  Truly the geekiest of the three, especially if you have any historical interest in the War of the Roses.

Great game with lovely pieces and a grand theme. However, rules need revising. New rules required to keep the game from stagnating. Recently played a 7 player game with a time limit - Player with the King wins when the clock strikes! Deaths are all 2,3 or 12 - it keeps the Crown deck supplied for longer. I have also created some of my own Event cards using the blanks supplied with the expansion set. Refuge cards are ditched as they don't help.

I've only played twice, with the basic rules, but I really enjoyed the first game but didn't have much fun the second (was with only two players). It really had simple mechanics for such a convoluted rulebook, and a lot of flavor. A bit euro-gamish, but with a strong theme that worked well. I can see the potential for a long drawn-out endgame if the surviving heirs hide in their corners, but if played with a bit of daring there isn't a problem. Or just play a set number of turns.

One of the few games I can get non-gamer friends to play. Political/military game of the War of the Roses. Play is centered on strengthening a faction, based on noblemen, in order to control and install one of the many heirs to the throne as king. Factions can be strengthened by the acquisition of lands, controlling cities, acquiring titles, or the recruitment of mercenaries. Combat is heavily abstracted and not very bloody. Play is heavily affected by event cards which may announce a plague or other disaster, or just ordering a given nobleman, or official, to report to some far off location (usually just when you need it least) in his official capacity. Whomever crowns the last heir king, wins the game. Colorful components, and a hard mounted map add to the game play.

Probably the first game besides Cosmic Encounter that had varied powers for players.  Still great -- despite the muddy board and miniscule font in the rulebook.  And unlike most games of this type, players are never totally eliminated, and the victory conditions (elimination of rival princes and crowning of your choice for king) are reachable in less than a lunar cycle.

I recommend using the advanced combat rules but not the advanced parliament rules.

RATING: 6.5
The old standby for a multiplayer game.  The one problem, however, is that through offices or sanctuary, certain areas of the board are very defensible to certain players.  When players decide to hunker down, you get a very long war of attrition.

I think this could be fixed by some sort of indeterminant timer mechanism - I'd suggest slipping in a "Historian" card (ala the Great Khan Game) into the Event card deck on the first reshuffle, then declare the winner to be the player/faction with the most votes in Parliment when it was drawn.

Great fun until most end games where the most common thing seems to be to "turtle up" with your forces in one or two places.  Then everyone waits for an unlucky event card and tries to ambush the noble(s) that were called out by the event card.

I recommend playing using the optional rule that any time an "Embassy" card is drawn, the event deck must be reshuffled.  If this isn't done, competent players will note which cities have already been visited by Plague and will tend to "hole up" in one waiting for another player to have part of his faction plunked down in range by an event card.  Reshuffling frequently puts the card-counters out of business.

I've played a few times with the extended event cards and the first edition advanced rules, but prefer the basic rules.

A very fine game for its age.  A bit too much luck, but great player interaction and solid historical theme.  Now, by too much luck I mean primarily the various cards that call away your main force just before battle, kill off a good portion of your troops in the plague, or leave you with noble titles that are too weak or completely useless to you.  The game can also bog down if all the players hole up in various castles waiting for the event cards to weaken their opponent(s) enough to justify coming to battle.
An excellent game, but must be played with more than 3 amendable players.

A game with lots of clever ideas that just didn't quite add up to a working game.  It also went on forever and hasn't stood up very well over time.

The historical theory behind its design (that the royals were just pawns of the nobles) is no longer generally accepted.

Always seemed ultimately broken to me.  Troops in castles ultimately always lose seige combat, and it comes down to one big fight at the end between two players, decided on the turn of a card.  
Nice history lesson though!

A great theme.  Some great mechanics.  Warping around the board, which destroys all planning = stupidity.

This game is great once all of the expansion cards are tossed into the mix.  Goes on too long, usually.  Subtract 1 from my rating if the expansion is not used.

When I play multiplayer games from the 80's, it strikes me that games that I considered to be simple and fast back then, now is relatively complicated and takes a lot of time, but time was not a limited factor in those days.

A prerequisite for appreciate Kingmaker is to accept that two or three plays out of four, will not be particular fun ...  because the starting hand is completely random. If you donât get a "noble" or a free title, well then you are smoked. Then you sit there with a number of job offers, like "Lieutenant of Ireland," but have no candidate for the job.

This usually results in that two players each have a "murderous attack", including a heir to the throne, waiting for the ârightâ peasant rebellion. This was ok back then, but today I donât have same patience and forbearance.

RATING: 3
Color and atmosphere galore, and of how many games from the 70s is that true?  But drags on for too long as factions sit in their own strongholds waiting for the other faction to get hit with plague.  Buy it for the historical notes and as a memory aide for Shakespeare's plays.

Can be a lot of fun, but I found games could stagnate while everyone waited for a lucky break (e.g. plague) to shake up the balance of power.

The Ariel edition from England has a superior board but if you don't know the English countryside you will have trouble locating towns. The AH version has a grid coordinate map but smaller board and components. I even enjoy the old Computer disc version of this game. I suppose I have played this one the most over the years.

Atmospheric, but bogs down easily as players often become risk-averse. The world is waiting for a Wars of the Roses game that's more accurate and reflects the urgency of the dynastic struggle.

I've only played this game once, but I enjoyed it.  It's very strategic, and there's aspects of luck thrown in (but not so much as to destroy the strategy).  It's a very, very long game....especially with two players.

Was my favorite game for about 20 years.  But, eventually the ambiguous rulebook (which creates endless rules debates) took its toll. You *must* use the Variant Event Cards or else 75% of games will devolve into a stalemate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great strategy game, but can be a bit long.  Recommend using the "shortened game" version of the rules that distributes all the nobles and titles up front.  This greatly speeds up the game play, without detracting from the strategy.  Takes at least one or two play sessions to master all the movement rules, and to get into the diplomacy and double-deeling.  DON'T use the Advanced Rules.  They're a pain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great game for teaching English history.  Plays a bit like a history book as well -- you aren't going to do much outside of the box strategizing for this game.  Hunker down with your successor in your best castle, lay siege to a few strongholds, and eventually duke it out in a big battle that decides who lives and who dies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just not worth the time.  This game pretends to be all about the diplomacy, but requires far too much luck.  Every game I played resulted in everybody holing up in a castle, and then the game dragging on.  And on.  And on.  You would have to twist my arm pretty thoroughly before I gave it another chance.  I can't understand the people crying for a reprint of this, unless they just want to relive the memories.  This is a real mess of a game that would take significant redevelopment to get it anywhere close to modern standards.  If this interests you, find a copy of [gameid=22038] instead -- you won't get the theme, but the gameplay actually works.

I prefer playing, at least with new people, without the Beaufort rule and with the optional Parliament. It should be noted that you really need at least one of the "Gales at Sea" expansion event cards, or it can easily devolve into one person with a weak army stalemating the game by staying with his one heir at sea indefinitely.

One of the better games the old Avalon Hill put out.  Captures the flavor of the War of the Roses, and is great fun.  Some clunky battle mechanisms.  Hard to come back from disaster, but then again, maybe you dont have what it takes to be King.

Still the first game I think of pulling off the shelf on the few occasions when I can find at least four other gamers.  The advanced combat rules have always added an extra layer of depth that really made this game shine when I was a teenager. Still have my well-work copy, stored with memories of some really nasty, vitriolic exchanges between England's blood royale.  With the right people, a rewarding experience.

Kingmaker is an enjoyable walk through the War of the Roses with multiple players. The mechanism of Coalition Building with nobles works very well, though the control of the contendors gets to be pretty awkward. I personally prefer sticking with the strategic game, and avoding the optional battle rules.

Badly written rules and long playing time never stop me from playing and enjoying this multi-player classic.

I tried this the other day, and my opinion stays the same. The first hour (or two) seem fun, but the game then bogs down when each player has a monster stack, playing cat 'n mouse with the other players. Lords are summoned around the board, mixing things up a bit, but the big pile-up at the end makes the game really drag.

A lot of the rules are over complex and can seem artibtrary. Difficult to get right first time. Only fun with a reasonable number of players, and even there suffers from some quite serious issues- the tendancy for all units to get stacked into huge armies that then hang around waiting for event cards, for example.

A fantastic mess, a classic. Great memories playing this before German games made their mark. Was wild thematic fun, full of heraldry and history, until we did a double take and wondered what the heck we were doing burning hours on it. The impression looking back is too much weird randomness for such a long game. Loved accumulating titles and troops though...

1/1/12 -- It's definitely time to revise this rating.  The 4 I'm giving it is generous.  

-----

Have only ever played a home(not my home)- brewed variant that lasts 4 hours.  Game seems to be loved by a previous generation of gamers, which leads me to believe that there weren't many multi-player war/political games available in the '70s.  Anyway, I'm not sure it holds up to today's standards, but it's fun to play from time to time, if for no other reason that to relive gaming history.  I definitely have no desire to play the game as it was originally intended (i.e. forever).

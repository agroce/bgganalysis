Fun to try one time. Lots of clever stuff going on, with the different search types, and the textures and colors matching, and the bonuses for completing small sets, but I had no urge to play again.

This is a stinker! Theme and art are vaguely appealing, but the gameplay is dire. Pick some tiles with different textures out of a bag in one of a handful of dull ways, then try to complete a series of little jigsaws for points. I was wishing this one away long before the end, and if we hadn't been playing this with a stranger, we would have walked away long before the end.

There is just nothing quite like this game.  The tactile element is just so original that it gets a lot of attention when I bring it out.  If that is not enough it has a shark shaped castinet(sp?).  Really just a cool game and a ton of fun.

RATING: 4
I feel bad for giving this a 4 but found that this game agitated me. I just wanted to take the bag of pieces away from other players and rifle through it myself. It wasn't the impatient feeling as you might get in an ordinary game ("hurry up already"), but just a jumpy anxious feeling. So I thought it best to trade it away.

Very unique dexterity/set collection game that has been fun to play with my kids.  They love the shark (which is completely unnecessary, but fun).  First play - misplayed the "fist" collection rule where you only get to keep ONE of each color -- correcting that rule should help with the "rich get richer" problem we had.  Overall, more fun than I had expected!

The activity is pretty great, though a couple of the textures are really similar in feel, which is too bad.  I hated the stealing mechanisms and I wasn't fond of the high luck levels (pulling the piece you need vs a shark).  In the end I'd be fine playing it but won't be seeking it out, despite the theme and style being in my wheelhouse.

After a few plays the game gets boring.  My girls enjoy it a lot.
EDIT: Played again after a while and it is really a good game. We just have to space the time between plays.  Increased the rating to 7.

One of the most original dexterity and set collection games ever. Searching for puzzle pieces inside a cloth bag based on their feel is more fun than it sounds. And the quirky theme and items that are built with the pieces adds to the charm.

Just playing the basic game, without the use of powers, I think this game is an interesting light game with a really appealing art style. Not sure I'd play it very often. You've got to love the shark though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great party-ish game for smaller groups (up to 6), without any pressure on anyone to be creative or funny, and the laughs happen anyway. I love how overproduced it is, gives it a real wow factor. The board is very pretty but mostly superflous, and the wooden shark is also not really necessary but totally fun.

One caveat: This should be played in teams of 2. Found that out on my 5th play. With singles, it takes more than half the game for anyone to get close to completing a piece, feels like treading water. So if you've got an odd number of players, go with something else.

Update: Played with another person's copy, and I swear their sand timer went like 30 seconds longer than mine. Took a lot of the tension/fun out of the challenges.

Dr. Shark is weird.  Weird doesn't necessarily mean bad though.  I can tell you this much though, there's not a lot to it, and it's a little too long for what it is.  Again, this isn't bad, it's just not amazing.  You're really coming to the game because it's insanely overproduced and it's got a good amount of fun in it.  I don't know what I like more, digging around in that bag or snapping the shark teeth win time runs out.  In any case, I can honestly say it's the most unique game I've ever played.

This game is really cute and can be really fun.  Three players might be the ideal number for this game.  More than that and the game spirals into a depressing mess. The puzzle pieces get too spread out between the players and there is a terrible point where everyone realizes that it is impossible for them to finish a single clue. It can be a little demoralizing. 
6 out of 10 shark clappers.

Dr. Shark, I have been waiting for you my whole life and didn't even know it. This game is pure fun. A great game for families, for kids, for all ages. The components are really top quality and you get so much in the box it's just crazy amazing. The theme is perfect...thank you Antoine Bauza and Bruno Cathala. 

I do worry about the corners of the puzzle pieces though, some of the piece edges are detaching from the backing only after one gentle(no kids)play. Also, I am not fond of poster size fold out rules...but the rules are simple and I can deal with it.  

The game is so simple. You choose a place to dive into the shark pool and take the action. Each action involves dipping your hands into a very large bag (representing searching for clues under water) and coming out with puzzle pieces that you will put together to complete evidence against Dr. Shark. You search for the pieces by shape, texture or even come out with a fist full. A game of pure fun, that will be played endlessly I'm sure.

At present I can't think of any other 'game' which relies heavily on touch to discern textures to score vps, so the novelty intrigues me. 

But Toms observation on the poor quality of the jigsaw pieces getting damaged and so diminishing the tactile aspect and functionality means I'll leave it well alone.

The concept of this game is pretty fun. You rustle through a bag of jigsaw pieces, trying to pull out the ones you want by feel only. It went on a bit long for what it is though.

This is more of an activity rather than a game.

You shouldn't play this one with more than four players. There is no player interaction at all.

Knowing this, this game is *a lot* of fun to play! But I do love my dexterity games!

The art is amazing and I love the concept.  Sadly the rest of the game is lacking.  It takes forever and it has an extreme rich get richer problem. If you complete sets that clear your play area so that you can get those sets again.  As a reward you get points and special actions that help you complete more sets or the same set. Those that are unable to complete sets have their have their play area tied up as you can't keep two identical tiles.  So when you clear a set, you can then steal tiles to clear more sets to get more abilities to steal.  The floundering players end up having to the bulk of their pulls returned back to the bag, spinning their wheels sitting as big targets for the players that have the stealing powers.

It is sad that such a great name and idea is wasted on the game design.

What a disappointment.

Ten rounds of pulling tiles out of a bag based on feel.  Components and art are sharp, and there are quite a few laughs.  Mix of luck and skill.  I just wish there was a little more to it.  That's just how I feel.

Disappointing effort here.  The idea was very clever, but the components are a bit cheaper than they should have been, and the game is just jerky and doesn't flow very smooth.  A good effort, but oh well.

I'll admit I was skeptical on how blindly finding textured puzzle pieces would work in a game, but it does.  It works so well in fact, that there is not much challenge to find pieces in the many ways proposed with the time allowed.
The real game starts half way in when you try to find specific tiles to finish your clues.

RATING: 6
Players are secret agents diving into the villainous Dr. Shark's shark-filled pool to look for clues. This is represented by feeling in a bag to collect pieces of different shapes and textures, on a timer, usually according to a restriction -- same/different textures (smooth, scaly, velvety, sandpaper, the other one), different shapes. Certain sets of pieces form pictures/blueprints, worth points.

Cute theme and gorgeous components, including an awesome but entirely unnecessary wooden shark clapper. An interesting novelty that's worth playing at least once, but I don't think I need to own it.

Ten turns is very slightly too long with three players; each turn isn't really any different so the game needs to end quickly, before players get bored. I suspect with more players (and so fewer turns) it would be better.

As for the game, it's nicely chaotic and stressful. It's also much harder to complete things than I'd expected.

I don't know that this has many plays in it, but it's decent fun.

While I've only played this with the girlfriend and her daughter, this was a lot of fun.  About as much as I expected if not a little more so.  Although was dissapointed that one of the pieces I will have to Fix to match the others.

RATING: 4
Dr. Shark hangs on the ability for a player to discern the textures of tiles without looking at them, and it is tough.  Several of the textures are exceptionally similar.  Hardworking, calloused hands need not apply.  Meanwhile, the theme and artwork are truly brilliant, if not best of the year.  But Dr. Shark has oddly low replay value.  Perhaps exploring the limits of their sense of touch is not what gamers are in this hobby to do.

RATING: 5
One play with 5.

I bought this one because I love to collect games with unique mechanics, it has amazing art and I got it cheaply.

I am not disappointed in the purchase, but it was not as much fun as I had hoped.  I need to play this more, but I don't imagine the rating going up.

Also, the game has problems with missing stickers (not major) and mis-cut pieces (a bigger problem).  I was able to do a good job cutting them, but I am a bit of a PnP guy.  I could see others being very nervous about cutting components.  I wrote to the publisher about getting replacements and I got no response.

Update:
After writing this comment I was contacted by Hurrican and soon had replacement pieces and texture stickers, so it may be worth trying a couple of times if you don't get a response the first time.  They are listening. 

Update: Rating has dropped from a 6 to a 5. Further play has not done any more to excite me. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to bring this one out again. The bag sifting mechanic is the ONLY things going on in this game and it really is not interesting or fun enough to carry the game. I do think teams are probably a better way to play as it is difficult to collect more than one or two pieces of evidence individually. I might give it another try with 3 teams of two.

The funny thing is I am unlikely to get rid of it. It is just too cool to look at. Besides, the demand for this is low enough that it would only be worth getting rid of if I didn't have storage space. I do, so it probably stays.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

Very unique game where you stick your hand in a giant bag of tiles of different shapes and textures, trying to feel around for the ones you need to complete sets. The mechanics are fun, but I found it fairly difficult to actually complete sets. Playing on teams might make it easier and more fun, but I haven't done that yet.

South Pacific: The famous Dr. Shark, a mysterious character strongly suspected of heading a secret criminal organization, is organizing a cocktail party on his private island. You are a secret agent and have just received an encrypted text message: "Cocktail party organized by Dr Shark – Important evidence probably hidden in pool – Attend party and recover evidence – Beware sharks! Invitation to follow by courier. IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE, WE WILL DENY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR ACTIVITIES."

At the request of your country's counter-intelligence services, you will mingle with other guests at the reception. Your mission: Dive into the pool to retrieve clues hidden by the infamous Dr. Shark – without falling prey to the sharks underneath the water!

Back on the surface, you will try to group your clues to form evidence. The secret agent who has put together the biggest dossier against Dr. Shark will have the privilege of putting him behind bars. Mission accomplished. The other secret agents will be thrown into the pool...

Dr. Shark brings a new feel to the idea of a dexterity game as players will rely on their sense of touch to discover evidence against this evildoer. Players have only thirty seconds per dive to recover as many clues as possible from the bottom of the pool, using their fingers to detect an object's shape and texture.

Dr. Shark can be played individually or in teams.

RATING: 6
A good game but unsure if this game has any replayability beyond the first handful of plays. To the game's credit, it is very unique and overproduced in some aspects, especially the very solid wooden shark clapper that comes with the game. However, the same cannot be said about the components of the game, especially the tiles. After three plays, some of the tile edges have started to lift up. This is extremely unfortunate since the game is all about tactile feeling of the tiles and will undergo a lot of wear and tear. If the backing is peeled off the tiles, then it becomes quite useless. Game works well with kids and adults both. But again, after a few plays, I no longer have any particular desire to play this game.

My only game so far was a good experience. This game is different and there is a small point of strategy because you can have special actions that allow you to steal or trade pieces to complet proof to score points.

GAME: Successors (third edition)
RANK: 884
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Enough variety and complexity to moderate the 'tall poppy' aspect and not too reliant on dice-rolling. Any diplomacy and alliances tend to be 'overt' and openly discussed across the board.

Tend towards a balanced game without additional generals 'loaded' into the Tyche deck.

I like the variety of starting locations randomly [?] determined by generals played.

Hard to say whether I like this one more than Sword of Rome. Some of the rules can be missed because they are different from SoR or Hannibal so check the rules and FAQ before playing!

RATING: 8.5
A historical lesson for me. Simple gameplay that is made complex with quite a few exceptions.

There seem to be players waiting at choke-hold points on the map and awaits the arrival of the body. 

Good tense game that is a cut above the others.

I always though producing a game of this period which was historical was impossible - so many swings of fortune and changes of side. I was right - Successors cannot replicate history (one of the things I think a game should be able to do).  But boy, it does replicate the feel of the period as mighty armies fall, apparently minor characters become great and no one is sure exactly what may happen next.  Full of historical flavour, relatively simple and fun, fun fun!  Just read the AARs to get a feel for how this plays and if you have any interest in the period buy a copy.

P500 Preorder.  Just received 09/12/08.  Tried two games on 9/27/08, one with 3 and one with 4 players.  The game seems much more balance with 4 as there is more tensions between players.  We only managed to finish two turns but have a blast playing it on the second try.  The 3 players game, there is too much space avail to expand for each side but 4 was just right since Europe was contested by 3 generals and asia minor by another 2.
Finally finished a game where Alexander's body was not buried immediately in Babylonia.  Got a luck roll of 12 with 14 sp (craterus) vs the force containing 15sp with the cart.  Since I have Antipater, I started to consolidate in Europe and pull my vp to 18 by taking out Greece.  Got the Silver Shields and decide to intercept the cart.  Craterus was marching around syria waiting for the cart to move out of Babylonia.  Very lucky roll in combat effectively ended the game since I have a hand of 4's & 3's to force march toward Pella.

One incomplete play was great, but too long. If I could be sure of finishing in a reasonably time, I'd love to play again, there's lots there: basically Hannibal RvC with four players. Some subtle complexity over the various types of points (Legitimacy, Victory, and others).

Thoroughly enjoyable, and with many paths to victory(and potential setups), it feels like it has a lot of replayability.  Maybe a little too much luck in the draw of the cards at times, but not too bad.

I have mixed feelings about this title. 
From one side I love the theme and some mechanics are brilliant (champion status, different ways of victory, neutral armies it's CDG !), on the other hand the fight causalities mechanics, siege mechanics are just wrong or too much luck based. Need to play it more to have better view, for now it's 6.5.

Important note in 3 players game always start with 3 generals per player !

- Leeeento.

- Demasiado faroleo y muy pocos combates, que además  
suelen ser demoledores para el que pierde.
Los combates son una lotería y poco puedes hacer para cambiarlo.

- Demasiado simplón en muchos aspectos. 

- Situación muy cambiante y poco planificable incluso a corto plazo. Te pasas la partida convirtiendo espacios que te vuelven a quitar al turno siguiente.

- Demasiado influjo de la suerte a todos los niveles y de forma muy poco controlable.

- Tiene bastante Kingmaking.

Me ha defraudado bastante. Hay poco wargame aquí, es más bien un eurogame vitaminado. 

Aún con todo tiene una cosa positiva, y es que a no ser que lo hagas muy mal puedes tener opciones de ganar hasta el último turno.

3rd Edition improves upon the original.

Legitimacy subsystem is brilliant and adds nuance to the game. Great replayibility. Tense and multifaceted with shifting fortunes and alliances.

I do have one major beef. It seems too easy to achieve an auto victory. Controlling Greece/Macedonia, Thrace, Ionia and the Greek islands will get you there. While this realstate should be of huge value it doesn't make sense that one should instantly win even if a huge army is coming to crush you on the following turn.

To continue on an anti auto-victory tangent, I have decided upon these main reasons why lenient auto-victory conditions hurt this otherwise fantastic game:

1) It makes victory too luck dependant.
- an aggressive player can win simply with hot dice. This encourages opportunism at the cost of long term planning.

2) It seems silly and unrealistic.
- see above. Temporary success should not win a game about dynasty building.

3) It slows the mid/late game down.
- having one or two players frequently a card play away from victory leads to analysis paralysis as players try to work out every permutation in order to prevent another player from winning.

4) It ends too quickly.
- I don't think I've seen a game go beyond the beginning of turn 4. Which is a shame as its so much fun to play one wants it to go the distance.

RATING: 7
First Impression: This is a multiplayer CDG with point-to-point movement. The multiple random starting nations make this game fresh every time. The 2 main victory paths involve different styles of play. One is your typical area conquest path. The other is to move Alexander's body to a specific location on the board. It plays out somewhat like football in that one player will move the body and others will try to block him and hopefully get him to "fumble" the body.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hopefully the random assignment of generals keeps the game fresh and interesting.  Anyway, I find Successors pretty random with the dice and card draws.  It's crazy how easy it is to acquire Major Generals, Elephants, Silver Shields or Brides from a single card.  Even though the card draws can be hugely unfair, I enjoy the swingy nature of the game.  Perhaps I am becoming more accustomed to card driven wargames.  

The major strength of Successors is the pacing of the strategy phase.  Being able to move during the Tyche segment and the movement segment allows for a more dynamic game.  A player can carry Alexander's body from Babylon (Asia) to Pella (Europe) in 5 or less strategy phases.  The major weakness of Successors is that one player can do all of the grunt work carrying Alexander's body and somehow lose it to another player with either the Treachery Tyche card or in battle.  One last comment... it's brutal to lose a battle involving a Major General with a 4 Battle rating to someone else's puny Minor General.

Everything looks good, bummer about the missing black plastic stands though. GMT did an outstanding job with this one: the mounted map is beautiful, large, and full of pertinent info.

The game feels like Hannibal, except no tactic cards and its multiplayer. A medium wait CDG with just enough strategy and chaos to be fun and thematic. I especially enjoy how the multiplayer diplomacy is handled. The game encourages attacking the leader, but the threat of being attacked by another Champion is always there. The penalty for betraying the cause of the real heir is always there, loss of legitimacy and freedom to be attacked by other players without penalty.

Playtesters, and anyone altogether too closely associated with any game, need to stay neutral in the ratings' game.  Not that there is any law against what they do.  Not that it's against the law or anything.  It just strikes me as biased and a tad tacky.  And as far as being tacky, well, there ought to be a law.

Okay - 3 core heavy gamers went after this game in two consecutive Saturdays - took 5+ hours each time. We're rather particular about rules depth, strategic impacts, consequences, etc. Part of really understanding the game. We'll easily stop in mid-play, check BGG for rules errata, and then move forward after a 20 minute discusssion of all the possible permutations.
Overall, like the game experience, but it took awhile to get into the 'slower' rhythm of game-feel this one had. What's funny about this is playing Antike at the next game night and laughing about the Successors equivalent to an Antike move - like 5 times the complexity :)
Even with the second game, we never finished - got done with second cycle and stopped there.

I like to play it from time to time, but not too often because I found it bery chaotic, and much less military it would seem. In reality is an area control game, with nameless minor generals too efficent.
The conflict build up is quite slow, and some bash the leader games have not been enjoying.

This is a great card-driven game for four. The random factions, the competing agendas, the over-arching goal of getting Alexander's Funeral Cart to Pella make for an epic contest that will take competitive players six hours to manage. A very colorful and lively game though a bit crunchy, too.

The general's deal at the beginning of the game can condemn you to a very bad situation (I had the two generals Western of the Bosphorus and I was just a spectator of the whole game). In a game that lasts more than 5 hours this is too much exasperating.

Apart from this (big) issue, I liked the game a lot but it'll be hard to get to the table due to the looong playing time.

Want to play it again but with another general's deal.

*update*

Game with great digestion, I want to play it again soon, it doesn't matter the long gameplay.

Multi-player Hannibal. Same style of board, with most useful tables printed thereon. Card driven 4 player action, control markers, isolation, opportunity for shifting alliances, posturing and so on as well as actual combat. Interesting "stop the leader" mechanism with you being able to attack the VP leader with no penalty (otherwise you lose Legitimacy as Alexanders heir). This means you don't attack most players without a good reason. 

You can win by VP or Legitimacy scores which makes things interesting. 

I want to play this again.

RATING: 9
Beautiful GMT reprint of the game depicting the struggle for Alexander's empire following his death. This third edition of the game originally published by AH has a beautifully mounted map-board, updated Tyche cards and the latest rules. Best with four players, there are also rules for two or three (the variant that appeared in the AH General for a fifth player is not in this edition).

Superficially the game would look familiar to anyone who has played Hannibal or Sword of Rome as elements from those games weave in and out of all three. The hook in this game is that your starting position(s) on the board are determined by a random draw of two generals with their own locations on the map and strengths. Hence each game will have its own dynamic. It is a game of area control via PC (political control) marker placement and there are independent areas that can provide for expansion without having to attack another player. Control of areas confer VPs which if enough are collected can lead to a sudden death victory. Control of various members of Alexander's royal family can confer "legitimacy" points which also, if enough are collected, is another path to victory. So, a lot going on and this is a long game so you have to pay attention to a lot of things and plan carefully. Battles can be lucrative but losing is brutal and forces are hard to replace so one must really think hard about entering into combat. Garrisoning key territories is vital but expansion requires some mobile forces all of which requires careful balancing. Learning to play is relatively easy but playing well will take a lot of experience. Not a casual game by any measure...

 While I think highly of this game there are some aspects that have to be identified. One is the devastating effect losing a battle can be especially if it involves one of your principle commanders. If it occurs in one of the early rounds of a turn, you are in serious trouble which may be hard to recover from. If it were a much shorter game it wouldn't be too bad but in this one which can go quite long you will be hard-pressed to be much more than a bystander. Another is that a turn consists of five rounds of play each requiring the play of a Tyche card. These cards behave just like the cards from a standard CDG conferring "ops" points for placing PCs, moving an army or raising fresh troops. Or, instead of ops points you can use the card to invoke an event which are many and varied and some are quite powerful. A few cards allow for both the event and the use of ops points. A lot of the events are so specific that the option to use the event is denied. A couple of cards invoke "unrest" which involve a die roll to see which territory is taken over by independents. Totally at random, these cards can wreck you unless you are well garrisoned. So, there are many reasons to leave a sprinkling of strength points about the map in locations that are vital to your empire in a game that is extremely stingy when it comes to troops. Further, at the end of each round all cards (except a few that are removed if played for the event) are gathered up, shuffled and re-dealt. Since you never "go through" the deck, a succession of poor cards turn after turn is a distinct possibility. Some cards may never be seen, and the potentially devastating Unrest cards can be seen more frequently than their numbers in the distribution would normally warrant. So, I guess I'm questioning the design decision to reshuffle after each turn. I would be interested in seeing how the game works by just going through the deck as most other CDGs do.

Winning then, comes down to extremely careful husbanding of resources and careful expansion coupled with good fortune in the randomness of the cards and events. Still, I find it fun to play despite the challenges.

Sit back, have an adult beverage, chomp on some pretzels and have some sword-and-sandal fun. With any luck at all...

Nice game with about the same difficulty as Hannibal: RvC by and large. My v3 copy from GMT is mighty pretty too. I like the unpredictability of the random "general" draw, but there is a chance that could somewhat cripple a session from the start I suppose if someone got a dud pair. Easy to remedy by making sure all players get a strong diadochi. Hey cool... the spellchecker thought "diadochi" might be "Indochina". Anyways....

Lots of scheming and planning as the forces fight it out over provinces, royal family members, dignatus and legitimacy. Multiple ways to win too which keeps things hopping and allows for many players to have an honest shot of winning it all. Interrupt cards can help thwart a leader, so determining if/when to play them is fun. Some tough decisions to me made. In my experience, risk is often rewarded which is a great thing to have in a game.

So what is not to like.... can be long-ish especially if you are cursed with an AP player. And that touches on another subject; namely the amount of fun to be had depends on the members of the group (same with any multiplayer). Also, it can be difficult to make a comeback in this game, so newbs that get stomped early can be left in the wilderness for a long, long time.

PROS: Cut, thrust, parry, lunge..... it is a fun time in the right situation. Don't take it seriously. Just go for it.

CONS: Can be dragged out. Setbacks can be difficult to overcome.

The new GMT edition has further refined an already top-shelf game. Plus you get a high-quality map and a smaller box. I currently rate it a 9, same as the original, but it might be a personal 10. It's random, but players also do have a lot of control and it's got great narrative. A little complex, but not bad at all on the scale of modern wargames (Blackbeard, for example - to me  a fun but much less satisfying game - feels more complicated), and you never have to worry about not enough happening.

Hannibal for 4 players!  Love this game.

Wow wargames are different when you play 4 players.

Alliances break and form every move.  The combat seems to be too punishing for the loser and little more luck than I prefer.

Has more luck of the draw than I liked.  You sometimes draw an extra general card that pops up near your opponent's unprotected cities.

I suppose it is a thematic element.  The game is about a civil war, and leaders can rise from anywhere without warning.

GMT edition is great.

RATING: 9
Two issues plague many a multiplayer game: the rich-get-richer syndrome and the whack-the-leader syndrome. The key is to ensure that an in-game lead isn't too powerful or too great a liabilty. I believe Successors strikes a good balance between the two.

Also, I welcome the game at least initially not being a free-for-all-fest. Such aggression is initially restrained by the desire to keep a facade of legitimacy intact, yet as the game progresses and the Alexendrine Empire further decays, those inhibitions gradually fall away. This gives the various phases of the game very much their own flavour and makes for a satisfying "story arc".

The combat system also works very well in this context, both putting you into the right mindset of  these warlords and also ensuring that any war between two parties will leave the bystanders stronger. The game is not attritional in character.

Furthermore, the multiple victory paths add some delicious nuance.

A very good and polished design. Splendid components. Very varied gameplay. I am glad the game now is back in print.

I like this game more than I should. It is fluid to the point of wild, extremely immersive, a compact multi-player politico-wargame experience. The lack of fronts, the very varied victory conditions, and the relative indestructiblity of most units and generals makes for a hell of a dynamic game. Throw in the cards and you have barely controlled but extremely engaging chaos. I would venture to say that the combat table and the general attack ratings do a decent job of keeping the dice from being too swingy in a game that can't get much swingier without suffering.

UPDATE 11/16: The more I think about it the more I come to the conclusion that this actually may just be my favorite CDG of them all, much as I appreciate the wide and vast historical chrome of Here I Stand and Virgin Queen. There's so much game packed into this bad boy, and it's faster and more accessible.

--


My robust expectations were neatly met in the first game -- this game is a trip, one I heartily recommend to anyone who is, like me, a fan of multi-player card-driven wargames. It's quite brisk by the standards of that sub-genre (which ain't saying much if you're not an initiate -- Successors can easily run five hours if it goes the distance, but cf. the ten hours a game of Here I Stand can take) and I didn't feel there was much down time at all.

The game begins with all of the players trying to maintain a veneer of legitimacy, which means no one can attack anyone except the person who started the turn with the most VP, but the game practically dares you to cross the Rubicon at some point, and once a couple of people have done so, all gloves pretty much come off.

There are three seperate and distinct winning conditions based on two distinct categories of points -- VPs are won primarily through province control (area majority) while Legitimacy Points are primarily a function of controlling the heirs to the throne and other Macedonian VIPs, plus a [i]huge[/i] potential bonus for a player nervy and lucky enough to take Alexander's funeral cart all the way to his proper burial ground in Pella.

This mischegoss with the funeral cart, in my limited experience, is what pushes the game over the line from good to great, because it introduces a Golden Snitch strategy that really works in game terms, which is not an easy trick for a designer to pull off. Players must be looking out not only for their standing in conventional terms but also keeping in mind the possibility that someone can swing for the fences and pull off an early auto-win, and opens up the possibility of players striving for entirely different goals, which prevents a tedious slugfest over VPs. And if you try for the LP win and fail, woe betide you for you are truly hosed. I feel like a game between experienced players will have too many headwinds to make LP victories terribly common, but the possibility must always be taken into account, and that alone aught to keep things fresh.

Also contributing to lemony freshness: the somewhat random setup of initial forces, with enough nastiness for the early leader and enough compensation for the early trailers to prevent too much rich-getting-richer -- I think.

And having boxed the otherwise excellent Sword of Rome around the ears a bit for a control marker sub-game that seemed to be there pro forma (because We The People had 'em, and so did Hannibal) I have to say that the control marker game really does seem to make more thematic sense in this game of proto-feudal civil war.

Warts may emerge with further playthroughs but right now this is a legitimate candidate for my personal Top 10 and possibly a straight-up 10 rating.

Fantastic wargame.  Lots of historical chrome, which is well implemented.  Great card-driven gameplay.  I like that there is a separate movement phase/reinforcement phase.  You can cover a lot of ground using OPs to move plus the move phase.
There's room for a bit of diplomacy and metagaming, makes it fun with a few beers and good friendly attitudes.  Luck plays a big factor - good and bad.  Some very powerful cards that can turn the tide.  One of the best parts of the game is the VP conditions.  Different ways, makes for different strategies.  Could make for a fast but still competitive game.

Good multi-player and I enjoyed my first play. It does have some problems which spoil it a little. For instance it's much longer than advertised and battle should generally be avoided (although this fits the theme) as you can lose your General and his army and wait a very long time to get more troops. The cards make things chaotic but fun and there are a few different ways to win. Doesn't suit people trying to bash opponents early and requires some luck and planning - all good things.

RATING: 8
From just one playing I would give it a 6 for game play. I am giving the game a 2 point boost because of the first class components and the look of the game. 

The game is simply gorgeous to behold. It has a mounted map and a really attractive mounted map to boot! The counters are excellent in both look and quality. The thickness of them are standard GMT, but that is fine for this type of game. I do find the cards are a little too thin for my taste and will most likely just sleeve them anyway if I continue to play the game much. Thin cards are currently the staple of GMT games these days and I would hope that GMT will see the light and return to some higher quality ones. But, that is a minor quibble because did I mention their is a MOUNTED MAP! I hope this is not just a fluke and GMT is finally going to put out games with mounted maps. Playing this game brought back fond memories of some great Avalon Hill classics with their map boards.

I enjoyed the bulk of the game.My low rating of the game play comes from a perceived run away leader issue we found in our first game. The player that had Alexander's body made a run for Pella and he also happened to have the biggest army. All three other players attacked him multiple times over two turns and we could barely scratch him. We managed to kill his leader and he had to resort to use a minor leader. That was our greatest opportunity to stop him, but we could not get the rolls. The loser of each battle loses all his mercenaries and elephants and suffers attrition to his Macedonian troops. The winner loses one CU at most! We all found that a bit harsh. There just seemed to be no way to wear down his army. 

We plan on trying it again in the near future and with a better understanding of the combat system we can approach the game differently and we hope that this will make for a better game.

One play

Negatives - I would say I don't enjoy the card play as much as in Twilight Struggle or Here I Stand.  For one thing, you get five cards in a round and you play five cards in a round and there's never any opponent-helping events to worry about (you could always just discard anyway).  So while it's technically a card-driven game it does lack that management tension I get from other CDGs.

Positives - That hardly keeps me from really liking the game, however!  I enjoy good wargames, but I admit I love games that give you something more to do than move and attack.  There are many ways to win; VP, Legitimacy Points, positioning yourself as Regent when one of the Heirs comes of age ...

I'm definitely hoping to play this again soon.

An excellent multiplayer game.  The multiple paths to victory keep players guessing.  I do have to admit that the run-the-body-to-Pella is my least favorite way for the game to unfold.  Almost mandatory if one player gets Perdiccas and Antipater.  Best with four players.

Best iteration of this classic yet. Takes the much improved 2nd ed ruleset, cleans up those rules so that they take up about half the space, and fixes a lot of card issues from the first edition while keeping the otherwise very nice production quality. The game can be wacky (and probably should be), but it's a great ride. Best with four, passable with three. Avoid playing two-player, the meat of this game is in the diplomacy.

After two plays (as of 8/9/09). Enjoyable game, but at this point, play still seems a bit on the chaotic side, and there are a goodly number of details to keep track of. Despite this, I think this game will probably move up in my ratings as I get the rule set down and strategies (hopefully) become more clear.

revised 11/6/2010: I just upped my rating to 8 - now that the rules have become clear, this really is a fun little game! Still can end a bit early if things break just right, but that's OK.

RATING: 10
Rating based on using all optional rules. I recommend withholding judgement on the game if you haven't played at least using the more balanced Extra Generals rules on how to acquire Eumenes/Seleucus. 

Multiplayer version of Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. Earlier conflict and predates the Punic Wars, but mechanics are similar and the designer for Hannibal is one of the designers of Successors. 

Alexander has died without electing an heir or appointing anyone to manage his empire after his death, despite being ill for several days (possibly poisoned?). His generals divide up the empire into satrapies while waiting for his Persian wife to give birth to (hopefully) a boy. The generals, Alexander's inner circle of closest friends, were much more loyal to Alexander than each other. Conflict results, and the result is Every General For Himself.

The goal is to conquer land and subjugate the people or convince them to support your faction. Make deals with other generals in order to defeat your rival generals. Claim legitimacy for the throne by marrying royal family members and/or becoming the guardian of one of the three heirs. 

The game is a great study of a very entertaining period of history. The game is mostly true to history. The important generals at the time are all depicted in the game and even begin in their own satrapies assigned to them by Perdiccas. However, for game play purposes, alliances vary from game to game. In a 4 player game, each player controls 2 such generals, who will always be allied throughout the game and always be vying against the remaining generals controlled by opposing players. For example, although Eumenes was loyal to Perdiccas throughout the conflict, in the game each of these generals could be on separate factions controlled by two players. What's more, each game is unique in that the generals are all shuffled and distributed to players randomly at the start of the game. One game, you might be playing as Antigonus and Ptolemy, another game you're Peithon and Lysimachus, each in their own starting area of the map.

Historically, Alexander's funeral cart (along with his body, of course) was rerouted (aka kidnapped) on its way to Pella. I won't spoil the surprise by telling you who the guilty party was in case you want to read up on it (hint: you should!). In any case, the game allows (encourages?) one to do this. Everyone wants credit for burying Alexander's body. Why not use treachery and steal it rather than the riskiness of overtly taking it via combat? ;)

This is a wargame, but battle is merely a means to an end. Victory is achieved by proper conquering of land and the earning of legitimacy, none of which is directly gained from combat. Combat is brutal as well. The losing power loses all elephants and mercenary troops. Loyal Macedonian troops are much more reliable and eventually return to service after a battle, but even that takes some time as each game turn represents several years of real time. 

Legitimacy (and Prestige) is another subgame where Royal Macedonian troops may shift allegiances to an opposing general. Craterus, being very popular among the troops tried to use this to his advantage. His adversary, the Greek Eumenes, knew this and was able to prevent his loyal Macedonian troops from defecting to Craterus' army. Craterus' arrogance cost him his life, and the game even incorporates this. Generals with a higher battle rating are more likely (though still rare) to be in the front lines and therefore die in battle! 

This is the only CDG I've played with the fun use of Surprise cards, which can be played anytime and immediately replaced. If you have Surprise cards you're not planning on using, you can even discard them to draw a replacement card. 

The game is heavy, but it also has a fair amount of dice rolling, and hence luck. However, if you go into it looking for a fun experience, and not necessarily a serious strategy game, then it's great fun with 3 other players. The various order of card events that occur as well as the varying starting generals makes me want to play this repeatedly. 

One of GMT's best.

Easily overlooked rules:
-A single general may not move more than 4 MPs with the play of the Treasury Looted event card.
-Independent armies receive local troops.
-And independent army may forgo movement in order to remove a PC marker.
-An army must have min. of 3 CUs in order to roll on the siege/subj table.
-A player does not need to be in the same space as Olympias in order for her to join your faction. Merely playing the activating card is sufficient, unlike the other women.
-If the Silver Shields has already been played once, the card now counts as a Surprise card, and can be discarded and replaced just like any other.

I don't really want to trade this, I just don't know when I will be able to play it.  It needs 4 to play optimally and I typically only have 1 other opponent for wargames.  This is essentially a 4 player H:RvC (which is a big compliment!).

I don't know why I continue to play these games - there's just something I repeatedly fail to grasp about them and so I flounder about ineffectually, until one opponent or another grinds me into the dust.  This one has a particularly cunning Legitimacy system that thwarts my primal desire to bash on whoever is obviously in the lead, negating the one trustworthy call in my all-too-thin strategic playbook.  Yet, I look forward to playing this again.  Will I never learn?

One of my favorites. Has some issues thanks to an all-or-nothing combat system and the "bodycart blitz" strategy, while difficult to pull off, can skew play. That said, one of the best for 3 or 4 thanks to being quick to pick up fast to play and fairly freewheeling.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's far more an "area majority" kind of game than a "combat game." In my experience, the aggressive player who picks fights ends up getting bitten in the ass quite hard by that "all or nothing" combat. Some "field battles" are inevitable, but they need to be managed carefully to ensure you don't knock yourself out of a turn if the cards/dice go against you.

RATING: 8
An excellent multi-player CDG wargame. Not too complex although there is quite a lot going on for the first play which results in much rule consulting and extended playing time. With players all familiar with the rules I thik playing time should be about 1 hour per turn with games lasting 3-5 turn, with 3 or 4 being more likely than 5.

The theme is very well realised and there is a load of strategic routes to victory that can be tried with the variable set-up meaning great replayability.

Probably a classic.

Finally! A bit more chaotic than I expected but still loads of fun. As long as you don't expect a balanced "fair" game it should be ok. Bashing the leader is almost mandatory here so demands players who can handle that aspect.

Love the period too which is a big plus.

RATING: 8
I have slowly been flirting with Card Driven Games (CDGs) for a while, and Successors has always been at the edge of my perception. I was hesitant to try it before for various irrelevant reasons, focused mostly on concerns about getting it on to the table and balance. Positive opinions of the game by my geekbuddies slowly change my mind, and I ended up finally getting it recently, and played it near of the beginning of the month. It was a blast, with a system that reminded me a bit of Hannibal, but with some differences that made it more suitable for four player play. The game was tense and invigorating, and there were plenty of moments where it seemed like anyone could win the game, though in the end it went to someone winning on victory points. We have tried getting it on the table a couple of times since, then but have not quite managed. That will change in the near future, and I expect this one to become a staple for years to come.

Tentative rating after one teaching session and partial play.   I love the idea of a 4-player CDG, and this really fits the bill.   The problem is that I will have little or no opportunity to play it.   There is a lot of chrome-y bits in the rules and the named characters and marriages which are hard to internalize on the first play.  The basic system of VPs and Legitimacy is a very inspired, however.   Each can be crucial at the right times, and sometimes the sum is important.

Probably the best multi-player CDG there is. Miles ahead of the randomness of Wellington, the scripted nature of Nappy Wars and the chaotic dice-fest of Sword of Rome. It works well with 3 or 4 players as well. With 3 generals per player (the recommended option), players are more spread out geographically and have more options to explore. On the other hand, four players means a different challenge, as players are more in each others' faces, and they'll need to weigh their threats carefully. 

Successors has got variety, multiple paths to victory, different strategies to explore depending on the distribution of the generals. The more I'm playing this, the more it is sucking me in. What more is there to say?

RATING: 8
I've given Successors an 8 due to the fun I've had interacting with the other players in our two games so far.  That being said, there are certain issues with the game that bug me:

First, there is the 'all or nothing' short-term impact of battles.  Most battles result in the loser's entire army being dispersed.  If this happens at the beginning of a turn, it can be devastating to the defeated player.  Given that you can lose an entire army on one bad roll of dice and that a much smaller force can defeat a large one with a good roll (and there are relatively few battle rolls in the game), it can be very frustrating.  If it happens late in a turn, it's not nearly so harmful.

Second, there is the 'teleporting troops' issue with the game.  Let's say the defeated player had a good number of Macedonians in his army who survived attrition.  He can then 'teleport' that general and his troops anywhere on the board that he controls during reinforcements.  Suddenly crushed Perdiccas pops up in your rear, or worse yet, you're suddenly facing a 'superstack' of enemy troops where a small army was before.  

Third, there's the Alexander's body issue.  A player can fight his way all the way to Macedonia, thwarting attempt after attempt to stop him, have a bad roll of the dice in a battle in or near Macedonia and suddenly it's the other player sitting in or near Pella who gets the 15 Legitimacy points for both the tomb and Alexander's heir (it takes 18 to win)...with virtually no time / way to stop him.  Better hope he doesn't have a bride or his Champion status.  

Fourth: There are also some unclear points about isolation / reinforcement placement.  We ran into an issue in Egypt that the rules left completely confusing.

Fifth: Only play this as a four-player.  With three there is just too much open space.

All that being said, you might think I hated Successors....I don't, actually, despite all the above, I really enjoyed playing it.  There are some quirks that need to be hammered out, but it's FUN.  You always feel like you're on the ragged edge of victory or disaster, there are multiple paths to victory, and lots of nasty little tricks to screw around with your opponents.  Also, it plays well online.  (There's a beautiful Vassal module for it at GMT's site...though the condemnation button doesn't seem to work.)

RATING: 6
A multiplayer CDG wargame that tells a great story, and has more going on than just attacking one another. You will have your share of attacks in the game, but the event cards and neutral nations offer different ways to go about messing with your opponents. Alliances shift depending on who's got the ball (i.e., body of Alexander) and heading for the endzone (bury the body) such that everyone is for/against each other at some point.

The brilliance of the game – and how it transcends being merely just another wargame – is with the addition of Legitimacy points and the royal heirs who can catapult you to victory by allowing you to combine Legitimacy points with Victory points. So even if you’re out of it from a territory control perspective, you can win by building up in LPs and getting an heir. 

It tells a great story and we find ourselves retelling the narrative after the play. Downside is that play time can go long, like 5+ hours so you need to set aside a good chunk of time.

Dripping with theme and fast to play for any CDG veteran. Features a superb diplomatic situation, with combat and politics being equally important. I would rate it a 10, but the capriciousness of the cards, which don't offer as many agonizing options as I'd like, and the drawing of generals, is a little too much chaos for me to completely embrace. This is the soap opera of the ancient world, so be prepared for complex and strange relationships and occurrences.

Wow. I delayed in getting this because my opportunities for multiplayer gaming are rare but I knew from its subject matter, close CDG lineage to Hannibal and reputation that I would enjoy it. After a first play it more than lived up to expectations. The period of Alexander's Successors was wild and the game certainly conveys all its flavour in a rule set that isn't hard to grasp once you get into its flow. There's a small concern that the bid to bury the body is a scripted play for whoever draws Perdiccas but there are obviously a great deal of options and the random general assignment promises variability and replayability. After one play I'm hooked and expect my rating to go up with repeat plays (planned soon).

RATING: 3
Rating based on one full F2F game.  The completely random and possible (if not likely) unbalanced starting VP, forces, and loyalty can make this a very futile experience for 1 or 2 of the players right out of the gate.  In a 5 or 6 hour game, this is very poor design choice. In a completely rational world, those screwed by this mechanic will act together, but the loyalty mechanics and board positions can make this difficult and the one thing missing in almost every bash-the-leader wargame I have played is rational behavior by everyone at the table.  Looking at other Berg games, it seems to be a consistent theme that balance is not a major design consideration.

So, you could take a look at the generals and come up with some kind of fair setup.  This would leave the other main issue I had with the game, which is the combat system.  Consistently in the game we played, we had superior forces wiped off the board by lucky die rolls, inferior forces hardly damaged at all in blowouts, and local tribes doing more damage than major P2P battles.  The fact that how much damage you get in a loss is dictated by your force composition, which is mostly dictated by your random general assignment, further highlights my first problem with the game.  Finally, there is also potential leader death, which didn't occur in the game I played, but sure seems like a game-ending sentence.

Despite all the above, I had fun in the game because I came in 2nd from dead last at start, was a thorn in the side of the contenders, and got really lucky in battle.  Therefore, I can see the draw of the game and could potentially play again if I couldn't talk the table into playing one of the many other great 4-player wargames that are out there.

Both games I played ended on turn 2, and I can't imagine a game making it to the end without an auto victory. Adding to the excitement, both games were close. They were down to the final card play. I won militarily and by legitimacy (without making it to Pella). This game is best with four, but still fun with 3. If you have a whole evening, you could fit a Euro game in after.

RATING: 9
Tremendous game, epic in scale, packed with historical flavour, very fun and intense. Beautiful components.

Each player controls a faction of generals in the Macedonian Empire. Each faction is seeking to lead the empire in the wake of Alexander the Great's death. You can win the game by controlling the majority of cities in as many provinces as you can, including provinces that have some special strategic importance (such as the route to Asia, or the naval passage into what is now called the Black Sea). The main mechanic for this is area control/influence, which means that you control more territory than you are able to defend by brute military power alone. You can't protect all fronts, players can often expand into each other's areas, and control can be a bit fluid. 

You can also win by performing certain cultural deeds, like collecting Alexander the Great's corpse from wherever it is and delivering it for burial in Pella (the major city in Macedonia where he was born), or collecting various other members of the royal family and holding them as political trophies, so to speak. 

The game involves some card play which can add some twists and turns, and sometimes some random screwage. Though this is a long game (plan for 8 hours even though it is possible to finish earlier) gameplay is dynamic, it moves quickly, and there are things to do during the other player's turn (like intercepting movement, avoiding battle, playing nasty cards, etc). 

Though the rulebook is 32 pages long, much of this is historical flavoring and wordiness. The game system at its core simple and even elegant despite the historical detail it is able to support. 

GAME LENGTH: I'd plan on 6 hours. That includes time to set up and go over all the rules. 

This is a really cool game!

RATING: 7
My first play was amazing and one of the best gaming sessions I've ever had.  With repeated plays I'm a bit worried about the game forcing you to try to bury the body.  In all my games it almost feels like the player that has the body must make the run and thus almost a for sure victory if they make it.  Perhaps that's just inexperienced players.  If that proves to not be the case then this game will rocket up my charts.

RATING: 2
This is my first GMT game, as well as my first play of one of the "latest generation", non-AH wargames (with the exception of A Game of Thrones, Nexus Ops, TI3, Shogun). I was looking forward to it, but after two hours of a five-hour game, even though I was doing well, wanted it to simply end. I was disappointed such that I thought secretly: "Has the state of wargaming come to this?" The effort/reward ratio is not high enough for me. This is simply not an exciting game. Each player starts out with only two generals in this Kingmaker-esque game, so there are only a very few options each turn: 1) lay siege on a city and/or convert another player's marker; 2) play a card and decide: a) use the points to give movement or apply towards purchase of a unit OR b) use the event, if towards my advantage; 3) roll the die to see how many movement points I have for each general; 4) move my generals and units. The downtime is quite excessive in a 4P game, such that when it comes around to me, I have several simplistic actions and then it's back to twiddling my thumbs--sort of like the boredom I experienced in Arkham Horror. There's plenty of strategic play, but I was more lost with "what to do?" than anything else. Perhaps it was the theme, since there was no sense of fronts, or feeling of amassing troops (except on the generals' cards). There were only like three unit types, but it was really a matter of the number of combat points. There was an interesting CRT, quite unlike I have seen in past wargames, and the results can be brutal. There was also the underlying "capture the heir" and eliminate all others aspect like in Kingmaker, but compared to Kingmaker, the theme is rather dry--I just didn't get it, or I just didn't care. The event cards introduced an annoying randomness that I did not like--one of the players acquired two generals, simply on the draw; I recall Kingmaker was sort of like that, but didn't mind that as much. Overall, I did not find this game satisfying in the least (The game of Antike that followed was much more enjoyable). I look forward to trying out other CDG "new" wargames, but this GMT title did not tickle my fancy. Or maybe I'm just not cut out to be a grognard? Initial rating '5'.

Update (01/16/12): Who am I kidding? I'm never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

A wargame, so it comes with tons of chrome. In my one play it was with four newbies, which is probably the wrong way to try to play a game like this. Understanding nuances like how deadly combat is and how tough the random enemies on the board are meant that I quickly lost all my armies and spent the next very long stretch doing nothing but slowly building them up. I was effectively removed from the game but kept playing a card every now and then. Actually ended up playing a game of Endeavour at the same time because I had so little to do in Successors.

Seems like the kind of the game -- like Here I Stand -- that if you had a core of players who knew the rules and played it every now and again could be heaps of fun. Unfortunately, I just don't see that happening to me personally.

Definitely had to learn a few tricks about splitting up troops to maximize the surrendering phase, what armies do what, and how absolutely brutal the combat system is.

All that said there are systems of the game that we didn't even touch because the cards didn't come up. No one had any fleets and I won on legitimacy. VPs players hovered in the high teens.

It was ok fun, but I think me having the body and a chance to win on legitimacy made the game more fun for me than the other players that couldn't win with that.

RATING: 7
A couple of simple innovations lift this above the average for a multi-player wargame: a random start and a limitation on which players may be targetted without penalty. The start position that you're dealt may not be overflowing with opportunities and a player can get to automatic victory by being located sufficiently far away from the centre to escape the intervention of multiple opponents. There are also some powerful cards (like Loot) that can get those closest to victory over the winning line by simple luck of the draw. In all, though, a good story arc, and several ways to win.

Still in shrink.  Edit:  5/16/09  Showed the game to Steve.  Took it out of the shrink.  Will try to get a four player game going soon!  Woot!

Edit June 14, played a four player game today.  It was good fun.  Game is easily understood, flows good, and full of options and replayability.

Played a 3 player game and a pair of 4 player games.  Still agree with the smooth mechanics, easy to teach, and replayablity.  It is kinda quirky though.  Battles can be brutal, even odds one suffers no damage and the other is vaporized.  Is some luck to it.

After a couple of plays with 3 and 4 players, I have a very good impression of Successors. The board is both attractive and functional and the rest of the components are of good quality. The rules are relatively clear. The 4-player game was more interesting as it provided more scope for alliances, but the game also worked well with 3 players. The chance factor in card drawing and die-rolling makes Successors a game of risk taking and opportunism more than long-term planning. This can be frustrating for a player with bad luck, but is appropriate to the theme and ensures that the game is dynamic.

RATING: 8
Mechanically great game - very dynamic, with ever-changing situation.
Quick moves.  Clear, streamlined rules.  No fiddliness or any unneccessary complications.
Several mechanisms interlock together very well.  That might be not so apparent at first, but strategically the game has more depth than the straightforward fight for control markers...

Great FUN (I don't mind the luck factor here, it' just that type of a game - focused more on narrative than on precise, and preferably uninterrupted, optimizing your gameplay).

There are some 'buts' though...  Playing time...  The game lasts 6-7h with 3 not-very-experienced players (I'm afraid to guess how much with 4).  And that's too much for it.
Also - the sheer length of the rules (despite their clarity) puts the newbies off.  It's the game for dedicated players. 

The entry barrier is high and that lowers my rating...

I'm hungry for more plays.  A sign of a really good game :)

RATING: 7
Rating is VERY tentative after one play. Erring on the side of caution with a seven. Could be an eight. 

[GameID=26457] is my first foray into multiplayer CDGs. It's very much a 4-player implementation of [GameID=234], featuring the same point-to-point movement, victory points based on regional control, sieges, elephants, interception/retreat, and generals with variable speed and strength, and, of course, cards that players either spend to conduct operations or trigger events. The game embraces and formalizes the "bash-the-leader" problem inherent in multiplayer conflict games, labeling the most powerful player "The Usurper" to Alexander's throne and removing penalties to attack that player. The weaker players operate as "champions" of a legitimate heir, but lose that facade of legitimacy as soon as they attack another champion. The game can be won though outright military conquest - i.e., the Usurper drives the champions before him,  through sheer buildup of legitimacy, or through the declaration of an heir (a handful of which come of age in the last two turns of the game). What you get is a system with explosive potential building underneath the surface. As a result, battles feel more decisive but less prominent, a win-win if you ask me. 

The flow of play in Successors is crisp and dynamic once you get the hang of it, but a "learning" game that goes the full five turns will probably clock in at 5 hours. The game also packs a good bit of theme, with certain regions being much more important than others (Greece, Egypt), a few cities that can be looted as part of a major bid for dominance, iconic women of the era that may turn out to have "plans of their own" (marrying Cleopatra to gain legitimacy might not be as easy as you'd hoped), roaming independent armies trying to return home from one side of the board to the other, and even Alexander's funeral procession, which players must guard lest another champion spirit away the body for a proper burial in Alexander's homeland (huge boost to legitimacy). 

It's too early to say whether Successors will become a favorite, but it gives a solid first impression and I imagine it will become quite rewarding with an experienced group. The comparison to Hannibal is inevitable but I do not assert it as all-encompassing; I'm quite sure each game reveals it's own subtleties the deeper you venture inward. If you're curious about CDGs, play [gameID=12333]. If you find your whole world of gaming stood on its head, as I did, Successors is a great way to add more players to the CDG paradigm.

Starting to think it's just me when it comes to We the People derivatives. Having played now Hannibal, Washington's War, and this, I'm finding it easier to learn the rules but am still not deeply enjoying the level of abstraction at which it operates. Maybe one of these games'll just click for me, but I don't think it'll be Successors. It's a nice presentation, and the rules are relatively clear (better than Hannibal, not as good as Washington's War). The cards are fairly complicated relative to other games, which steepens the learning curve somewhat. The semi-random setup (which kind of reminds of of Shogun, actually) results in some better and worse combinations. I found it rather arid, but then I was basically knocked out by widely divergent placement of my generals and being beaten up by the guy who ended up in third. (I ended up in fourth.) Might consider playing again, but I wouldn't jump at the chance.

I could see my rating of this climbing a notch or two; but whether I ever play it enough to have that happen is doubtful.  It was good, but I'm not so inspired I'll run right out and buy a copy.  So who knows when I might ever play again?

Simply excellent.  The amount of choice in any phases makes this game extremelly interesting to play and you never feel out of options or stuck in your strategy.  Also the rules have a very natural flow.  At our first game we were never slowed down by having to look in the rule book, an excellent thing for a wargame!  Played this game with 3 and 4 players.  With 3 - still very good, but it truly shines at 4.

Traded away once before, bought again to give it another chance since I got a good deal. Good thing I did. Quick enough to play in an evening, downtime isn't bad at all and it can be incredibly tight and fun.
The paths to victory are different enough, while somewhat dictated by your starting setup, but the situation will change radically during the game that you can and need to craft a flexible strategy to get the best out of the situation. Some quirks, like the dispersed troops and reinforcements teleporting, also the starting setup can have too big of an effect on the outcome.

RATING: 9
Have played this multiplayer CDG several times now and have always enjoyed it.  Multiple paths to victory, coupled with randomized starting positions, and a wide variety of event cards assure that this game never gets old.  But the real beauty of this game is the legitimacy rules, which compel semi-cooperative action against the leader, unless and until an individual is willing to give up on that path to victory.  Well-balanced and interesting multiplayer historical games are rare, and this one is a gem.

RATING: 9
A game published in late August 2008 by GMT for the 3rd edition of the AH 1995 game.  A grand subject as the game title suggests.  The breakup of Alexander's empire into 3 kingdoms.  Very nice map.  Succession war of Alexander's world in 302B.C.  

Each of the four players would have different stories to tell according to their randomn pick of the factions in the game.  I was once Perdiccas who was to escort Alexander's body together with the Royal's Heir back to Pella.  Loyalty level would increase by 10 if Alexander was successfully buried in Pella.  There were a lot of difficulties along the way, hostile factions controlled by others who didn't want you to win, tribes (mainly the Illyrians) uprising in the Mecedonian region, the difficult terrain (cost mroe MPs) between the strait and the mountain etc.  The dead body, however, decays after turn 4 and hence no longer available for burying. 

Control of the city is crucial to win the region's VPs.  Isolation of the control markers would remove them automatically. Combat is a bloody thing.  All elephants and royal units are eliminated and the rest are "dispersed" for the losing side.  The winning side just lose 1 unit.  It is a very engaging and yet simple combat system to simulate the scale of the battle and its importance in the ancient world for a single battle.   

What a game!  Each person would have a different game on his own.  A very playable and exciting experience.  It is a long game though despite only 5 turns. Each turn would consititute 5 rounds.  So happened the game ended in turn 3 as the night fell.   We finished the game at 8 o'clock after 8 hours.  

This is a game for any ancient buff. I am sure everybody would love to have this game!!

I was overwhelmed by the rules at first, but as you play it becomes fairly straightforward (though I definitely wouldn't be able to "run" this game by myself!). A good amount of options are available, and the amount of variety seems like it would be very good even over multiple plays. Gameplay ties with the theme well, but it's also not chained to actual events so there's a lot of freedom in what the outcome will be (which I really like). The game ended pretty quickly due to a victory via Legitimacy Points, but I found the variable ways of winning a good way to keep things tense right from the get-go. I enjoyed it!

RATING: 7
4 / 5 - Great.

A very solid combination of history, political machination and random violence. Downtime is about as low as you could reasonably expect for a game of this sort and the military and political sides of the game sit nicely side-by-side. The trouble I have with this game is that there are heavy disincentives for players to actually attack each other: instead interaction tends to take place through ordering neutral armies (of which there are a lot in this game) and playing annoying event cards. The spaced-out initial setup also limits the scope for meta-game diplomacy. Finally the byzantine victory conditions are a bit of a turn off.

Probably the best multi-player CDG wargame, better by a good margin over its competitors and playable in a long afternoon.  Actually, one of the best games period in my collection.

GMT edition is an excellent update of the old AH game, both in terms of components and rules tweaks.

Surprised and pleased that GMT went with the mounted map and essentially kept the excellent graphics of the original game.  Looks even better now and plays well.  

Multiple paths to victory, and the randomized setup plus card play ensures a high level of replayability.  Also, fortunes can change very quickly in this game, so don't give up.  Somewhat chaotic, and combat is high risk and very costly for the loser (realistically so?).  But despite these gaming elements, Successors is my favourite multi-player wargame.  Also, quite teachable for experienced gamers.  

Definitely worth trying out if you're a fan of card driven games, especially Hannibal.

UPDATE 2: If I'm honest with myself, this is a dream game that can turn into a long, slow nightmare. I'm not sure why, but I can't get Successors 3 into my head after a very promising start. And since it's so hard to teach, away it goes. Sad. For trade. Farewell, S3! Was it you, or was it me? 

UPDATE: Still haven't played the new edition to completion, but did play half a game.  Curiously, I found the rules quite unintuitive and that did hobble my excitement level.  It also seems that it would be difficult to teach to non-wargamers.  Now, to play again after reading the rules through to completion!  Lowered my score half a point.

Only played most of a 3rd Edition playtest, but this is just such a wonderfully asymmetric game filled with lots of juicy chrome.  Most importantly, however, the game MOVES.  Rating will settle when I actually play the new edition to completion.

When I got the chance at a couple of playtest sessions, I jumped at the opportunity.  I'm not biased with my rating because there is no reason to be: Successors, 2nd edition was already my favorite CDG until replaced by the 3rd edition.  

With that said, Successors III refines and streamlines an already great, yet underrated, game.  It plays differently each time because the players randomly choose their generals (therefore the starting positions) before the game.  Each general has different strengths and weaknesses as indicated by their initiative rating, combat rating, and personal "prestige" (if any).  Players use only one deck of cards that can be used a variety of ways.  There are several paths to victory and lots of agonizing decisions to make since you can't do everything you'd like.  The geography is more expansive than Sword of Rome, so there is more room for maneuver.  Also, I love how the system integrates both warfare and political intrigue.  What keeps me coming back to this game is the tension the game creates by the constant threat of other players and the tough choices that need to be made each turn.

RATING: 10
Very good 4-player game. No planning and not so much strategy but it's fun.

Combat is actually not that random. With just 1 additional combat factor you have at least 66% chance of winning the battle (75% with 2 factors and 80% with 3 factors). So, while it is true that a weaker army can entirely destroy a larger army, it is quite unlikely. It means that when you are outnumbered you are very likely to get anihilated.

RATING: 9
The production quality is excellent and the game is very fun. Thanks to the randomness of the distribution of Generals, the replay level is high, but balance may be hurt, sometimes… Players with poor Generals, map positions or weak forces will be able to play a role and somewhat influence the game, but won’t win: As in all CDG games, luck is a key factor. Nevertheless, the game gives a good description of the chaos ensuing the death of Alexander the Great.

CDG and Ancient gamers: This game deserves to be in your collection! :-)

UPDATE 1:

I have tried a game with five players and a more historical distribution of Generals: It a was very interesting game and I believe this game deserved a reprint with five players components and victory conditions... I'm not very sure about the 20 VP victory condition for five players. The way the usurper is determined should also be refined, IMHO! 

UPDATE 2:

Some combinations of Generals are pretty difficult to defeat (Perdiccas-Peithon, for example) and should be avoided. Generally it is not a good idea to have Generals forming blocks on the map. Some house rules are thus required to achieve a relatively balanced distribution of Generals. Replayability might suffer a bit, but it's better than an unbalanced game start...

This game has a lot of details to remember.  Some would call this chrome.  The cards make the game unpredictable, which I like.  The game is self-balancing, in that coalitions will shift if any one player gets too far ahead.  I recommend playing with four players and plenty of negotiation.

I can totally see why this is popular. Heavier CDGs are not really my cup of tea, though. Having to recheck rules and details alot. I'm left with a feeling that I would rather be playing HotW.

1st play-While the other players were busy trying to get the body delivered, or prevented from delivery, I started to carve up the map coming in strong from Egypt and spreading out. I think I might have won if played all through.

2nd play-Claudio, Michael, Tripp and me again. About 3.5 hours. A lot less intercepting on the board this time. A LOT of experimental kind of moves going on also. Splitting armies up more and leaving in garrison with a minor general. Hijinx with the body. I was definitely punished for my warring ways. Unless you have a serious numbers advantage, combat can be just punishing.

I could mayyybe be talked into playing it again with similar level players.

I just wish this was a little faster. Well, more than a little.

I like the components of the new version! A mounted map for a wargame, that's pretty rare. The rule book is also in color, glossy paper. I'm a bit disappointed with the Tyche cards, there are no images on them (unlike most other CDG), kinda like "The Conquerors - Alexander the Great. But overall, the quality of the components is great.

One play, so it is hard to rate, and I'm not a wargamer.  I love the map and the history part, but the troops, movement, and combat rules seem so overly and needlessly complex.  This gave me a sudden appreciation for Martin Wallace's Byzantium, which now appears to me as an elegant simplification of Successors (only because the map cover the same region).

RATING: 7.75
This is a very intense game to play.  You feel like you're running out of time before a turn is over.  This may cause you to make a rash decision by attacking.  Attacks must be carefully planned.  If you loose your general in battle then you must wait until the reinforcement phase of the following turn which can be an eternity depending on when you lost the general.  Scoring is not cumulative rather VP's and LP's can increase and decrease by changing control.  Remember Prestige points only count towards who has the most legitamacy when battling.

Fun game, but I never have the right leaders to be the most legitimate heir on the board. I dislike that it means you could lose troops if you fight someone who is "more legitimate" than you are. I understand it's historical, but I just don't like it because I'm never in that position.

Excellent Game. I really enjoyed the underlying storyline with its 3 different Thematic Victory conditions which adds a lot of depth in the game.  Compared against "Sword of Rome", I find the combat system less of a luck fest even though there is still dice and you are less dependent on the cards you draw.  There is also a lot more replayability as the starting conditions will vary game to game with the changes in the Generals and Provinces each time you play.

RATING: 8


As a four player game, brilliant and tense. Probably way too much for a typical euro games player, I guess, in that it isn't "elegant." But models the chaos of the years after Alexander's death well.


The primary drawbacks? There are two. The silly roll-and-move mechanic. It's silly to roll dice for movement, and doubly so to have to cross-index your roll on a chart to find your actual movement points. This gets tedious in play and slows the game down. The second issue is the combat system. During battle, both players roll a die and consult a chart which returns a number, and whoever has the highest number wins the battle...the loser then rolls again on a different table to determine losses. The idea, I think, is to build some indeterminacy into battles, but I would have preferred some other system for this. These two systems slow play and are blemishes on an otherwise wonderful game.

Oh boy the drama, the tension and the story it gives you. A bit longish with noobs but it's worth the investment every time, no matter you win or lose. Patience is tested but something is always slipped under your nose or something could have been done differently. Most balanced battle resolution I have ever seen but the casualties can be hard to the loser and minimal the winner, although recovery can easy with Loyal Macedonian troops and coming from behind anything but impossible. Great production quality, although the cards could have had some illustrations. Best with 4 players. One of the best multiplayer CDGs on the market.

Plays more cleanly and competitively than the 1st edition. Not as chaotic as first appears, with some tough choices growing kingdoms early in the game and lots of diplomatic tension in the mid-game. More bluff and maneouver than a real clash of armies, but it works well. Random general pairings makes for great replayability.

Very nice game that I enjoyed playing even more than the 7 rating indicates. Would be rated higher except for my outrage that a game that has been around as long as this one should have such a disfunctional rules set. For God's sake, how hard is it to simply plainly state the flow of play and what happens rather than force players to pour through examples of play in the rules; discuss the interplay between different rules sections; & consult the entrails of chickens as to the meaning of one ambivilent sentence after another in order to find out - even then we had to agree via vote at times. It isn't a complex game - just say it - stop beating about the bush - just bloody say it!

Very few changes from the first edition. Primarily incorporates errata and FAQ clarifications. Even with GMT producing, the rules are a little clunky and hard to reference during a game.

RATING: 7
Amazing 4-player wargame. The randomized dealing of starting generals provides replayability, as well as when different events come out. Most of the events are useful no where you are on the map (a lot of the Surprises have narrow uses), and the events are mostly just boosts, they don't overly dictate your strategy.  But most importantly, the theme beyond fighting really comes through. Do you try to bury Alexander in Macedonia and risk losing him, do marry the other royalty, do you poison the air? Just the right mix of battle options (intercept, avoid, sieges), and easy CRT, makes for quick simple battle calculations.  I would give a 10, but it just takes too long to get to the table much. Even though it has cards, it works solo quite well, as there aren't that many surprises that knowing about them will affect your decisions with each player.

Update: Downrated from 9 to 7. I would still be up for playing it with some players that knew the game and liked it, and could hopefully bring out the joy I first experienced. As of now, it can kind of just drag. Combat seems a bit too deterministic and the result of losing too devastating.  And I think I might just not like CDG's that much (although still very hopeful I'll like COIN where the cards are open).

There is much that is positive. I particularly like the way that game set-up is variable in that the generals controlled by each player are chosen at random, creating different constellations of power each game. It lacks, however, the central tension of most card-driven games in that even though there is an "ops-event" choice when playing the Tyche cards, you can always move your generals afterwards; as a result, the dilemma of how to use the cards does not feel quite as stark in the other CDGs I've played. Therefore, perfectly decent and interesting as a game, but it's not really the multi-player CDG I was looking for.

RATING: 5.5
Rated after one play. I'm not a great fan of card driven political games with lots of dice throwing, so treat it with a grain of salt. However, my game was decided in a single battle, over a single dice throw: I pushed forward with the body of Alexander with two armies of maximum size one next to another. I've been attacked by a player with half the forces I had and lost. Virtually all my units got killed, and a couple of survivors removed from the board till the next 'big' round. The winner, with a single casualty, easily buried Alexander in Pella two turns later. The whole game took over 2.5 hours (and we ended very quickly), which was too long for me considering the heavy-grained randomness involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What an overrated and bloodthirsty little twerp Alexander (The Great) was. So the little upstart with a superiority complex won some battles against second rate competition. He united a … yada, yada, yada. When he wasn't naming things after himself or executing rivals he was racing around pointlessly risking revolt with little Indian holidays. Yep, there sure were a few reasons to poison the King of Kings. And what did he leave? Well, certainly not a line of succession.

So, what to do with the body? Well, that's where Successors 3rd ed. gets laid out on the table and fought and schemed over for three - five hours (depending upon player experience and which victory conditions are achieved). And what a clever little romp it is. To start off the game has a terrifically effective and simple way of ensuring each of your games will be different as each player chooses two characters at random to control. These characters might be next to each other on the board, or at opposite ends of the board. They might be a reasonably skilful leader with a strong force of loyal Macedonians (not necessarily loyal to you), or someone very skilful with few Macedonian troops and a large compliment of fickle mercenaries. Where you start and what forces you have, in combination with your other leader, will help shape how you're going to approach the battle ahead. The battle is essentially for victory points or legitimacy points. Both are useful and there's a variety of ways to earn both, but the player who is out in the lead with victory points becomes the Usurper, and here's where they've done a very clever thing - only the Usurper can be attacked by the other players without losing their Champion status (worth three legitimacy points). Throwing away Champion status is not to be done lightly because those without Champion status are now open to attack without penalty, just as is if they were the Usurper. So, what does all this mean? What it creates is a fine balancing act where players make land grabs (often needing to attack Independent forces - which are non playing forces that literally litter the landscape), slowing down you opponents' movement through defensive interception - all the while threatening to unleash your forces and strike a mortal blow if the opportunity arises. Oh, it's good.

I was concerned that a player could be knocked out of the running early, but upon reflection that's only likely to happen if a player is too aggressive or if they don't value their troops highly enough. This is not a game where you have a mass of armies and you can afford to lose a single unit. Every unit is incredibly valuable. Entire turns are spent piecing an army together one unit at a time. If a player is unlucky with a leader death, or a couple of unfortunate one rolls in a siege, then they have the option of forging an alliance with another player and getting themselves back into the game. It's cleverly done. I like the card driven side of it where cards seem to be nicely balanced and with meaningful choices as to whether you'll keep one of the optional ones to build up a move, whether you'll use them for the operations points or the event. Add to that the tiptoeing nature of the conflict (don't worry - blood will be spilt), and the changing alliances and player interaction and you've got a very good game. To top it off the game doesn't run too long that you can't finish it off in an evening (with experienced players). Top stuff and I'll be ordering a copy next time it's on the P500 list for sure.

This is a very good multi player game.  I like the way the setup was done, not knowing in advance who you get or where you start.  The positioning and generals assigned to each player make for unique strategies and tremendous replay value.  

You have the constant need to not only work towards obtaining victory for yourself, but preventing the other players from obtaining their goals.  Its a somewhat unique characteristic because those don't always go hand in hand.

Alexander's generals are laying competing claims to be legitimate successors. What distinguishes this game is that it's not (necessarily) a simple smash-and-grab but rather involves intricate tactical maneuvering. It really feels like a competition that starts spiraling out-of-control towards an eventual civil war. This is achieved via the legitimacy mechanic in which getting Alexander's family and heirs on your side and not attacking other players creates the potential to win diplomatically. The variety of victory conditions keeps the game tight and tense while putting a cap on total game length. A number of optional rules enhance gameplay -- rolling for attrition when exceeding the supply limit will give Perdiccas something to think about when deciding whether to run Alexander's body to Pella.

This is a great game and can be very fun.  The level of randomness can be a bit heavy and the battlefield victories are too sweeping, but aside from that, everything else in the game is pretty much perfect.  I would like to see a version where the players can choose one character and then be assigned their second character randomly. The combat reorganization rules can be a bit harsh and the potentially long waiting period encourages poaching and can throw the balance of power off very quickly.  As I said, aside from those complaints, the game is cutthroat Successors combat at its best.

A solid, well-executed game. It's pretty close in feel to being a multiplayer Hannibal, though with a bit more historical chrome concerning legitimacy, troop types, and some other details. Naturally, being multiplayer, it also has more potential for chaos wrought by shifting alliances. This is also encouraged by the Usurper mechanism, which essentially puts a great big target on whoever's leading in VP's and lets everyone else attack them without repercussions. All in all, I think the game does an admirable job packing a multiplayer historical gaming experience into a ~3 hour playing time, which is no mean feat. However, given the time, energy, and opponents, I find Here I Stand to be more rewarding in both historical detail and strategic depth. But if you've only got 3-4 people and can't spend the whole day gaming, Successors fits the bill quite well.

A pleasant surprise.  Wasn't expecting this to feel as fluid as it does.  Rules are relatively simple and intuitive, with the notable exception of the control rules and how they interact with neutral and enemy spaces.  Still, this does share a lot of rules with simpler card-driven systems like [gameid=234] and [gameid=38996].  The variable setup keeps this interesting through a high number of plays.  The setup is intentionally asymmetrical, with a high variation, which is a nice change from most asymmetrical wargames, which tend to stick religiously to the historical grounding.  The game has the additional advantage of a fascinating setting, as it's about the quick dissolution of a grandiose empire.  It's a rarely gamed idea, as most games are about the rise of empires, rather than the fall.  Good choice for mid-length multiplayer wargame.

Este juego me gusta más conforme lo voy jugando. No te dejes llevar por la primera impresión, sobre todo si vas buscando un juego donde el tema bélico sea el más importante. Imprescindible en una colección.

Probably the best multiplayer card driven war game.

There are a lot of similarities to Hannibal, which makes sense, since the games share a designer. I like the system more in this multi-player format, though. One of the best multiplayer wargames- it doesn't fall into the typical traps that you'd expect from the genre. Positions are fluid and the different victory conditions really allow players to attack the problem from different angles; they make for a variety of circumstances you can be in and still be in contention for the win. I love the legitimacy system and how it ties into battle and the different ways to win. What really seals the deal for me however is the setup of player positions by randomly allocating generals (and their territories) to each player; this really creates variability from game to game in a major way.

Cool game that of course we messed up a couple of rules on since this was the first time we played. I think this game will get even better the more I play it. Looking forward to playing again.

So I finally got this one to the table and my rating has dropped on this one mainly because of the combat system. I find this game to be subject to whoever gets the big stack wins. The all or nothing combat system makes it very difficult to put a scratch on a large stack and leaves the loser of a battle crushed.

Looks like a fun, variable game in the aftermath of Alexander's death.  As a history buff, I'd love to play.

Only played once, but I loved it. Will be hard to find the right group for this, though. Explaining the rules to  others is proving difficult and I am the only one in our group who is a real ancient history buff.

Negotiation games don't get me like they used to. I'm not a fan of the Ancient era. So still earning a rating of 6 is quite impressive. Very flavorful, with the right amount of chrome.

See my review. That was first impressions but it really is a complex and interesting game.

Excellent light multiplayer CDG.  Seems to accomodate various player-counts rather well, including the always-sticky three player table.  A little light on historical flavor and accuracy, but worth playing.

A 4-player version of Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage.  I liked my first play quite a bit and I'm looking forward to playing more.

After 2 games I increase the rating of this game. There is a wonderful possible combo that makes every faction able to win.
In each game I played there was a chance to win for 3 players depending on the combination of cards and dice in battles.

Muy buen juego multijugador, divertido aunque no es un juego totalmente redondo. La rejugabilidad es muy alta y está muy bien pensado, a pesar de las dificultades que entraña la propia mecánica del juego. Un gran juego.

생각치도 않은 충동구매로 암사동에서 구매한 게임. 그것도 별로 싸게 준 가격도 아니다. 싯가보다 만 원 더 준 것 같아.. 하지만 룰북을 보고 메커니즘을 살펴 보니, 이거 물건이다! 적당히 워게임의 시스템과 영향력 게임의 요소를 골고루 잘 버무려 놓았다. 게다가 워게임치고는 4인용인데다가, 역사 테마의 변두리에 있던 디아도코이 전쟁이 배경이니 만족만족! 섭의 비협조로 영문 룰북 독파하는데 어려움이 좀 있었다. 그나저나 이 걸 돌리려면, 아무래도 워게임 모임 같은데 나가는 것 말고는 따로 대안이 없을 것 같다.

Except for the general dislike in multi-player wargames (which always result in one-against-the rest) the game seemed promising. 

Probably would rate higher, after we played another game with the correct rules :)

/played Sword of Rome and have to say that it made me like Successors more. The story is more involved and the battle system less random, which (for me) is always a plus.

8/15/10 - After 4th play, fires on all cylinders (and it's a V12).

06/25/10 - After 2nd play, very good.  Sort of a boner in a box.

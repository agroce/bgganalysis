I am not sure what the appeal of this game is to so many.  It is a negotiation game with a few cards thrown in to encourage an outcome.  Play choices are pretty limited based on a few cards in hand nad how well you can convinve others to let you win.  If you enjoy strong player interaction and don't mind open ended games where the game duration can swing wildly, this may be the perfect game for you.  If you prefer a little less chaos in your games, this is likely not your best choice.  Your reaction to the game will be strongly influenced by the players you play with, so choose wisely.  With a few beers and a group of friends in a light-hearted mood the game may shine.  With cut-throat meanies, you'll wonder why your wasting time.

RATING: 9
[i]Posted: 1/19/09, Rated: 9[/i]

This rating is based on the version of the game released in 2000 by [company=4871]Avalon Hill[/company].  Yes, I know there are a lot of people who say that it is the worst version of them all.  Still, this is the only version I know, and my family enjoys it immensely.

I can't believe that original design for this game is over thirty years old!  The rules are streamlined and easy to understand.  The ability for each alien race to break those rules in its own fashion feels like a more modern title, and adds a vast amount of replayability.

We particularly enjoy using the order disks to determine which player will be attacked: they remove any guilt or resentment from choosing to pick on someone.  A player who accepts an alliance request isn't so immune from blame: there is still plenty of opportunity to build up resentment and to exact your revenge.

The board in this version is cleverly designed, with options supporting 2-4 players.  My sons love putting their fighters into the Mothership, or into their Carriers when assisting with a planet's defense.

A game with simple rules, offers lots of player interaction, and has fun components.  That's a sure-fire winner in my book.  I'll make a 1-point concession for those nay-sayers who say the older version with more powers and flares is even better.  Perhaps I'll need to pick up the newly-released [thing=39463]version by Fantasy Flight Games[/thing] as well.

Played this for the first time last night. I really enjoyed the gameplay - I get why a lot of people like this game. The lower rating is due to the fiddly pieces of this edition. While the stacking ships look cool they are difficult to load into the mothership and carriers and easy to knock over. I guess I'd be happier with wooden cubes, but then again I'm not big into miniatures in games.

This game is the ultimate 4 person party game.  Simple yet complex, with a medium playing time.  Players own 5 planets, and a number of ships.  On their turn, they attack an opponent, asking the other two players for support.  After combat cards are played, the higher total wins, with attackers or defenders either being destroyed or rewarded.  
  The key aspect to the game is that each player recieves an alien at the start.  Each alien bends or breaks one rule, giving the game thousands of possible combinations.  And it's short enough to play many times in succession.
  I would recommend this game to everyone.  It is really fantastic.

I've played this once, and even then not all the way through.  My gaming group is full of hard-core gamers (favorites include Puerto Rico, Arkadia, Goa, and others), but we all said the same thing about CE: "Huh?"  While it's certainly possible we just flat-out missed something, it's more likely that we just don't fit the type of group this game needs.  We all felt it was too formulaic and utterly devoid of any sort of strategy.  I promptly traded it away.

For some reason, the AH version of CE gets a lot of flack on BGG.  Maybe because it had the least number of aliens (20).  Although I remember when AH first released this CE, and they had some promotional material on their website saying that expansions for CE where in the works.  However, AH never published any expansions.  But the quality of the components and artwork of this version was the best to date, and still looks great today.

The first time I played Cosmic Encounter was with the Avalon Hill version and I thought the game was just OK.  I was then told by some fans of the game that I played the worst version of the game and I need to give it another try.  So, when Fantasy Flight produced it, I bought that version.

CE probably qualifies as my "gateway game", the first one I played that offered the more robust and interesting gameplay of a modern game.  While its design is still archaic in many ways, balance is poor between races, luck is a potentially game-breaking factor, and endgame is pretty boring most of the time, it's an enjoyable one to come back to once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This actually MAY be lamer than Simply Cosmic, which is pretty impressive. The overall lack of cards/powers sucks and removing flares is just ridiculous. 4 player max too? Laaaaaame. Why take a game that's all about variation and start removing options?

Still, it's better than nothing. I've played a TON of games of this edition and had a great time, but if you have any choice in which edition you play (and now thanks to Fantasy Flight, you should!) definitely skip this one.

This is the older Avalon hill version.  After spending a little bit of time fiddling with the funky ships that come with this version, I wish I would've just coughed up another 20 bucks and bought the fantasy flight one.  

Also, one of the funniest experiences I've had when someone has thrown a fit and quit a game, this time man in his late 50s at the FLGS with much swearing and slamming of bits into box. (I had nothing to do with it).

When I have 4 players together this game is near the top of my list to play. In my opinion if you don't 4 players then don't play Cosmic Encounter. I love that every alien race lets you break one of the rules to have an advantage over the other players. So much replay and I am thinking about buying the new one to get more races.
4p best.

I bought the FFG version. I don't need both versions. Out of my collection.

RATING: 2
Components: Great design that really realizes the sci-fi theme. The character cards are super thick, the spaceships are hefty and in bright colors, and the planet designs look wonderful.

Experience: I didn't enjoy my one playing of this; it was far too much a tit-for-tat game. As inexperienced players, we never delved too deeply into the negotiation potential, nor handled our special powers too adeptly. But I don't think players should need to be good at a game in order to enjoy it, as seems to be the case with this title.

I think I liked this a bit more than the other players at the table.  We played the Hasbro edition...4 players.  First the components.  Let me state the obvious..this game is overproduced.  The mothership is useless and generally gets in the way.  The defender ships aren't needed either.  Don't get me wrong, they look cool. But they really serve no practical purpose.

One thing I would like to mention is that this game should probably be played by a group of people that do not have "eurogame expectations".  Just expect some chaos and enjoy the ride.  The number of decisions you make in this game is a bit low...and the guesswork is a little high on most of them.  Still I find myself enjoying it because it is fast (an hour or so), fun, and simple.

Great classic game.  Feels like an Ameritrash game, but I think has some elements of a Eurogame.  In a way, it feels like an eaiser varaint of Diplomacy, in that player cooperation is so important.  

My rating here is for this specific version of Cosmic Encounter.  I rate the newest version ([gameid=39463]) a "9."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cosmic is a classic design that I really enjoy.  There are some things people don't like about this game.

The race powers are completely unbalanced, of course.  There are some that do nothing at all unless it's your encounter and you win, in which case you get a pretty marginal win-more bonus.  There are others that are always-on passive, useful things.  Some are very easy to understand, others highly technical.   But this variety is the game's strength.  It's up to the players to find the balance in their games, to prevent someone from running away with it.

Turn order, sadly, is the biggest real strike against it.  The game won't last usually more than a couple rounds through the table, so if you're to the right of the start player, you might only get a single turn before it's over.  This doubly sucks if you've got a power like the one above, which only works on offense, and triply if you lose your first encounter and never get to do anything positive at all.

With some groups, this just falls completely flat.  If you don't care enough to get into it, to wheel and deal at least a minimal amount, to care about who allies with who, and who ultimately wins, this will be awful.  Some are put off by the lack of control in the destiny deck, others by the simple highest-total-wins combat.  The bare-bones design is pretty random, and can be skewed into one-sided games.  There can also be rules interpretation questions, even with the new edition, and that's before you get into the complexities of the variants like technology.  But, if you can get a group interested, this game can be a  real winner.
Personally, I feel like Cosmic is a great game.  It's a game that transcends its simplicity and engages the player with simple, yet meaningful choices.  Who to ally with, and how much to commit?  Use a high card now, or save it for later on?  Is it worth burning that all-important cosmic/card zap for this situation?   It can overstay its welcome a little, if the play is slow, and (much as I love expansions) tossing in too many variants can slow that down even more.  But I'd still play this almost anytime.

(Down from 7.75 FFG edition)
Edition note: The old hasbro version of the game isn't terrible, but it's far from the best one.  It omits a lot of stuff that's found in other releases.  Only 4 players, no flares, no other chrome.  As I recall, there were a couple small rules changes as well, but nothing major.  The ships & other components are good quality, and it's still Cosmic, so it's still fun.  But it really is a bare-bones edition.

Every time I have played this game, all the expansions have been mixed together so I can't comment differently on the individual expansions, or the base game for that matter.

I have never been enamored with games with heavy card text, and when others found cards humorous and clever, I didn't appreciate them to the same degree.  I would rather play the game and think of the strategy, than read something during play that doesn't have that much to do with the game.

If you have only played the Hasbro/Avalon Hill version, you owe it to yourself to try one of the editions with flares and a greater selection of alien powers.  Otherwise, you're just not getting the full Cosmic experience.

On its own merits, I would rate this an 8/10, but I've marked it down a point because it's so inferior to other editions.  The Eon and Fantasy Flight editions are more like 10/10, and Mayfair is 9/10.

RATING: 4
This version excludes much of what makes other versions great, so it's probably the worst version I'm aware of. It lacks variety with a limited number of alien races and powers, and so lacks the depth and replayability of other versions. I've read other reviews that love the "high quality components", but to me they're not that great and don't make up for the reduced game content. I wish I would have known about the differences between the Cosmic Encounter versions I knew and loved and this one before I bought it.

Completely random, chaotic and unbalanced. Huge luck factor, no strategy. Some powers practically break the game. At least this version is very beautiful, and that is why I rate it a bit higher. It even made me want to design a new game using the components, but I eventually sold it.

This one seems sort of outdated. I like the concept, but it's just not a tight enough game. For a supposedly diplomatic game, there isn't much deal making to be had, and since the person you attack is random, alliances are pretty meaningless. The AH version sure had a cool production though. Ah, well. Traded away.

RATING: 7
This game is deliciously broken—it's all about the player interaction; the most "metagamey" game I've ever played.

UPDATE:  Giving this classic the 10 it deserves.

Hasbro/Avalon Hill edition:  7

2008 Fantasy Flight Games edition:  10

[q]Bluffing, gambling, negotiation, backstabbing, outrageous reversals—this game has it all.  And a thick, gooey science fiction theme to boot!  The rules are simple, almost laughably so, but that's not where the game is.  The game is in finding the most clever way in which to use those rules to your advantage, no matter how bleak the situation.  Taken at face value, it's pretty lame, and I can see why some people hate it so.  Add in a bunch of raucous, cunning friends and the game surprises and delights every time.  I'm constantly surprised at some of the subtle ways "I'm screwed" moments can turn into a big win.

Negotiated (or even forced) multi-wins are great since they keep the playing time more than tolerable (Read: occasionally [i]too[/i] short—but what the hell, let's play again!)[/q]

RATING: 6
I was extremely disappointed in this version of CE.  The components are limited.  The game's core essence is the interplay of aliens; there are very few included compared to other editions of the same game.  The pieces, which the Art Director must have been sold upon, just look confusing and weird to me.. as if they were rejecting the traditional just to be arty, and devil take the gameplay aspect of things.  Poorly supported by the resurrected Hasbro/Avalon Hill group, according to designer Olotka.  I can believe it.. this is an anomaly in the long history of one of the best games ever.

RATING: 4
Clearly the game not for me.  Simple, repetitive and all in all... boring.  On paper it looks good, but negotiations, alliances etc. turn out to be pretty straightforward and not too exciting.
  I like all these concepts of races with unique abilities and artifacts with special powers, but I'd like to see them used better, in more interesting way.  For me - wasted ideas.

And one element disqualifies the game aside from my personal preferences: shared victories.  They make the game boring and BROKEN.  It's very easy to ally with sb and win collectively.  Thus winning does not depend on the skills, but on the sheer fact if you (or your opponents) managed to ally.  Win in alliance is easy and totally unsatisfactory.

--

I played AH version with plastic ships, carriers and mothership.  These are cumbersome to handle so my group quickly resigned from carriers and mothership and we used only basic plastic ships.

I realize AH version doesn't have all the features of other versions and that there is a lot of expansions to the base game, but I have no desire to dig more into this and explore all the possibilities.  I've saw enough.

Hasbro/Avalon Hill edition.  I've been on and off the fence several times with CE and have no experience with any previous editions, so I guess, ignorance is bliss.  The object of the game is to establish 5 of your colonies on any other player's planetary systems.  Sounds easy enough... A compelling game of unpredictable variety as every game is quite different.  Unfortunately I can't seem to find enough players to make better use of the alliance element in the game.

Whenever I mention it I've been told I'm playing the wrong edition, or the wrong rules, or I need to add this element, or take away this element...I suspect the main thing is that to enjoy it I need to have fond memories of playing it for hours in my dorm room back in college.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit.  I like how the allies, negotiations and which system you attack are structured within the game rather than being free form like Risk.  I look forward to playing it with other Alien powers.  I can see that this game would have quite a bit of replay-ability.

RATING: 9
This game can go either way. On the surface it seems to be not all that interesting and with just way to many options for races and powers. With the right group of people it becomes a mass of bluffing and negotiating and working to keep the leader down. If your group doesn't understand that social aspect of the game, or their are inexperienced folks it can fall flat. When it works with the right group, its one of the best games of all time. If it didn't require the right group, I'd rate it a 10. As it stands, there are some groups I wouldn't always want to play it with.

I prefer the Fantasy Flight version over this. And have sold my Mayfair editions of Simply and More Cosmic.

12/04/03 Bought the Hasbro/Avalon Hill 2000 edition. Many people poo-poo this version, saying it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the older incarnations. I don't. I think this version is fine as is. There's plenty there to keep me interested. The only thing I regret is Hasbro never put out the 5/6 player expansion they said they would when the game was first issued.
As of 03/01/17 I've played 27 games.

Probably it has the best interaction&fun ratio after Twister, but it can cause more damage. Really simple rules create a great playground for intrigue and negotiations and strategizing and generally screwing everybody over in a lighthearted manner. Four players the most I can gather, so I'm happy with the AH version, but I consider to get the FFG edition as well for the cards and aliens alone, keeping the AH components.

I'm proud that this version was my intro to Cosmic Encounter. This was perfect for us at the time because my non-gaming daughter thought the artwork was cool, and the whole family had a great time with it. The component quality is very cool, except for the encounter cards.

The more I play this, the more I really enjoy it. To have fun playing this, you have to make it fun almost silly-style, not giving in to the seriousness of the artwork. However, I wish to play Fantasy Flight Game's version to see if I desire a different version. This Avalon Hill version is fine, but the rulebook is fiddly, the components are fiddly, the aliens are fewer, the tone is too somber, and it only plays up to 4 players. Some gamers consider this to be Cosmic Encounter Light. I'm tremendously glad I have it, but I'm also glad I didn't pay a lot for this.

I wish this version would play more than 4 players. Also, the 2 player variation isn't too good.

I'm in. Wish the new AH version had more than 4 players. Good stuff, very interesting and quite different from anything else I own. Update 2/11: This game is so unpredictable and unbalanced that it requires a certain kind of player to enjoy. More serious players may find the randomness very annoying. This limits the likelihood of it getting played for me, but I will continue to look for situations where it fits, because I enjoy it under the right conditions. I've recommended this a number of times, and everyone seems to have enjoyed it. The game has been through a number of revisions, perhaps I should upgrade and try this again...

Finally got to play my copy. Just one 4-player yet with the family.

Pretty fun and fast-paced negotiation/abstract wargame. Just a bit repitative though. In the first game "Macron" was overpowered and hard to beat since she got all the heavy attack-cards from start.

Gotta play some more. Plays reasonably fast: a "superfiller".

Best components of all of the various editions. Unfortunately, AH was a bit too skimpy on the implementation  of this old classic. Flares should have been included, an expansion that would (could)  have added the fifth (and sixth) player components along with additional aliens. As it is, I have combined various elements from all of the different versions I have owned using this set for the components. (The new FFG edition is the closest to the original and I like the addition of the techs.)

All of that said, this is a good game even in the AH version. It can be had cheap and every gamer should have a copy.

Note: the FFG version is the best for game play.

Cosmic Encounter is a fantastic game of making and breaking alliances, sometimes in the same breath.  
Totally unbalanced and chaotic, yet somehow not lacking in grand strategy.   It's up the players to unite against a brokenly powerful enemy, or fail due to constant infighting.

This version (2000 Avalon Hill) is absolutely beautiful!  It doesn't allow for a fifth player, but the board and components are gorgeous.   All cards are sleeved.

I haven't played any other version of Cosmic but I can see why you'd want an additional 2 players. I think the ships looked great and I think there are enough alien race cards to keep things mixed up. Overall, I found allies to be too powerful in this game.  It didn't feel like you had a very good chance if you wanted to take the solo route.  Some of the alien race cards were too powerful in my opinion (Virus).  It's a game that just didn't click for me but I can see the good in it and I understand why so many people love it.

RATING: 7
Interesting blend of negotiation, rule breaking abilities, and card play.  The sci-fi theme puts some people off, but I think they're missing a great game.  A game I wish I got a chance to play more often.

I have the Hasbro/Avalon Hill edition, which while many believe is inferior, seems just large enough for how much I want to get into the game.

Played the Avalon Hill version and I enjoyed it quite a bit. There is A LOT to think about each turn, and I like the aspect of virtually no down time.
There's backstabbing, second-guessing and negotiation, all wrapped up in an hour. Components are nice, albeit a bit fiddly. There's certainly a unique, old-school, vintage vibe to this game, and I believe that adds to the enjoyment.

I'm curious to see if a significantly bad starting hand could kill any possibility of a win. Perhaps?

A traditional screw-the-leader style game.  I loved it when I was a teenager, but since then, I've seen the light with Eurogames and this is just really no longer my style.

I'm not sure what I think about the game -- the random opponent thing is nice because no one feels like they're picked on, no one gets ganged up on because of an even target distribution, etc ... but it's so random! The game is more one of negotiation, trying to arrange the right alliances; and hand management, trying to draw the right cards (!) and win the right battles. The various alien powers should give every game a different feel. Will have to try the game with different aliens, and/or combinations of 2 or more aliens per player.

Erm, this is messed up. I mean, they can't be serious right? Well, if you want to play a -game- you can remove most of the aliens or play without them...and you're left with something rather dull.

IMPORTANT: IT IS THE AVALON HILL EDITION THAT I AM REVIEWING!  This is important to note, since there are apparently some significant differences between the various editions.  So let's start with what this edition has going for it.  Firstly, it has very cool bits and is visually quite appealing.  Seeing the game set up for the first time was fairly impressive.  Secondly, it is much simpler to learn and faster to play than I was expecting, and certainly has everything one would require for a basic "Cosmic Encounter" game.  So what are the strikes against it?  Starting with by far the biggest problem: it only supports 4 players instead of the 6 that other editions allowed, and in fact it only plays well with 4.  This is a big disappointment.  As for its other problems, it is definitely a stripped-down version, not having more than 20 alien races or any of the chrome that glitzed up the earlier editions, and those beautiful bits are quite fiddly to handle.  Despite those setbacks, the game is a very fun and extremely interactive experience and it does have all the basic elements required for lots of fun and varied plays.  I could foresee my rating rising as high as an 8.5 if it weren't for these issues.  I'm sure I am one of many folks who are very intrigued to see what Fantasy Flight will do with this game.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

Played a game where three of the four players had quite impressive powers (Zombie: No death for ships; Virus: Multiply strengths instead of adding; Laser: opponents draw attack cards blindly) and it was stupidly unbalanced. The Virus player was unstoppable, slowed only by the fact that nobody wanted to invite him as an offensive ally.

The system is still interesting. I don't like special powers, but here the asymmetry is almost the point of the game, which is fine. I also don't like hidden info and simultaneous moves and bluffing. Not really any way around it here.

It's quite nice and interesting how you don't get to choose whom to fight. This creates high likelihood that you'll fight your "allies" sometimes, and have common interests with your "enemies" (or the leader you wish to bash) as well.

This game is randomness, managed by chaos.  The randomness comes in the form of wildly (and intentionally) imbalanced special power assignments, and the only way the game balances it is by allowing player chaos to even the scales.  Of course, this means that there is TONS of metagaming in every session, to the point where the actual mechanics of the game take a distant, distant backseat to trying to convince your neighbor that "No, honestly, he really IS stronger than me!"  Ecccchh, awful!

This version is the worst of the bunch.  The plastic and art looks great, but the ship pieces are fiddly, and the cards feel very flimsy.  The cardinal sin, however, is limiting the game to four players.  What little redeeming value there is in the chaotic metagaming is lost with so few players, as there aren't enough people to allow group dynamics to shift and flow.

In Cosmic Encounter, you play the leader of a colonization effort whose ships are traveling throughout the Cosmos to prove their worthiness for Cosmic leadership. You will use force,cunning, and diplomacy to win success for your unique form of alien intelligence. The winner(s) will be the first player(s) to have FIVE COLONIES on any planets outside his or her home system. Additionally, each player is a race that has the ability to bend or break certain rules in the game.

Cosmic Encounter is an amazing game and one of my all-time favorites without question.  It's unfortunate that the Avalon Hill edition doesn't really do the game proper justice.  This version is limited to only 4 players, includes only 20 Alien Powers and has some attractive but frustrating-to-use ship tokens.

The Avalon Hill edition is functional and will service a new/casual group just fine.  The ships, planets and overall graphic design are very beautiful to look at.  But for most folks, it's hard to recommend this release over the new FFG edition, which offers so much more of what makes Cosmic fun.

A not-so-fantastic version of an otherwise fantastic game.

Love, love, love Cosmic Encounter.  I would rate it higher but the version I have of it is just about the worst one ever produced.  They took our a lot of the great things that other versions have (moons, flares, more races, only 5-6 players, etc).  It does have some nice plastic ships.  I want to get my hands on the new Fantasy Flight version of this one since they put some of that back in.  Also Fantasy Flight might actually put out an expansion or 3 for it.

A decent edition of this great game that seems to be commonly despised because of what it doesn't offer, as opposed to what it does. My complaints of it are its fiddliness and the low quality of the cards. Everything else is fine and still shows off an excellent, thematic, chaotic, surprising game.

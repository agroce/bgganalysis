RATING: 4
I played this game in a fog, failing to understand the rules around the ranking of suits and what could be played. I take my win as a comment on the quality of this game rather than on the quality of my opponents. As so often with minimalist designs like this, less is simply less.

The cards are very colourful and production quality is to Oink's usual good standards.

RATING: 8
2nd edition contains 10 cards and 5 strength markers per wrestler.

I think it is very underrated due to a bit confusing rule.
However, once understood, the rule is pretty simple.
A good family / filler ladder climbing game with an interesting tweak.

A simple game, I don't think once you've figured out the ranking chart that you're left with a lot of decisions to make.  But there are a few.  And it's cute.  And you can chat while you play.  Not a gamer's game but you know what?  It's good fun for the right crowd.

First Impressions:
---------------------
Didn't find this one very interesting (At least at 3 players).  Like all Oink games, this one looks really good, and has some very nice components, however the gameplay was lacking big time.  There were a couple of small decisions, but for the most part, this game felt like it played out itself.  Something I'd try again at a different player count to see if there is something there... Wouldn't recommend unless you REALLY want a wrestling game (although, the theme is very much pasted on)

8/14 - Great design, but the fiddliness of having to figure out what ranks where is distracting and was a puzzle which shouldn't have been there. When you take that out, it's just a simple trick-taking game with great bits and artwork.

My favorite Oink game thus far?  I love the theme and presentation.  The rules for determining how wrestlers are ranked is all but impossible to figure out from the English translation, but once you finally grok it (or have it explained), it clicks and the game is simple at that point.   Not sure if the late hand play is all that interesting, but trying to set up a good late hand is where the game is.

The rules are not very well written and can be confusing. To really understand the game, we had to watch a video online that better explained the rules. It has a similar feel to the classic President card game except that card values are not predetermined.  The idea behind the game is good, I'm just not sure it is very well executed. You seem to spend more time figuring out which wrestler is stronger (which can be confusing) rather than finding a strategy to win.

A nice twist on trick-taking/climbing games, where the cards themselves don't have values, they are defined by the previous rounds.

The rulebook is not too clear though, so you might want to clear your doubts elsewhere ...like here, on BGG!

Really enjoyable trick taking/laddering game with a fun luchador theme. Nice mix of logic puzzle and a card game, which is rare in a trick-taker. Rules can be a bit funny to teach at first but they work well. Rounds can be decided early on if you're heavy on certain cards and that wrestler ends up weak, but c'est la vie. Plays quickly so is a good filler too.

Pretty game, but the rules are so obtuse, that I'd hate to teach/play it with a newbie...and even if I'd be playing with the same players, it's nowhere near as good as Red7 or any number of light fillers. Overall, not worth the effort, I think. (Only played 3 player).

Very admirable attempt at theme, and nice graphic design as always, but the initial rules hurdle is too big to get a wide range of potential players.

Maskmen is a fast paced card game with original mechanism of determining card strength. Players race to empty their hand while estabilishing charts of mexican wrestling tournament. The feeling you get when you look trough your hand makes it one of weirdests games you would ever play. It seems that designers of Maskmen tried to replicate the spirit of the fake sport (everyone knows wrestling matches are set) and they kind managed to. Definetely a nice filler and party game with big lol.

RATING: 7.2
A unique climbing game where the strength of the suit (wrestler in this case) is not predetermined but adjusted while players play their cards. It is also unique in that the cards are not numbered. It could be a bit tricky to grasp the way to determine the relative strength of the wrestlers. But once everyone understands the core mechanism, the game flows very well. I wish the designer would revise the scoring system so that the later "seasons" - at least, the final 4th round - would be more important and meaningful than the earlier ones.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

My first play with three players felt like a disaster.  There really didn't seem to be all that much control.  When I did try to pass strategically, I must have done so at all the wrong times as I still was hammered hard.  I really want to like this game as the graphics/components are nice and the concept is interesting.  Maybe this one needs more players?

Beautiful, perfectly sized box. Takes three to four (short) games to wrap your head around, but it's worth it. Basically a shedding gane, with relative suit values you set during the game itself. Very witty. Theme fits perfectly.

An interesting take on the "ladder" style of games in that the ladder is constantly shifting and variable, which helps smooth skill level discrepancies between different experience levels.

Components are nicely made and the game is very nice looking. This may be a result of being a Japanese game, but the stacking of power from right-to-left can take a little time to get used to.

(+) Unique theme that somehow suits the idea of a climbing trick-taker.
(+) Vibrant presentation, as is typical of Oink publishing. 
(+) Interesting twist on climbing in that you re-establish the heirarchy of "suits" each round.

(-) Ruleset feels unpleasantly ambiguous at times.
(-) It is far too easy to control the lead in 2p games.
(-) Seems to lacks strategic depth.

Not sure I got all the rules right the first time I played. There was several instances where the player couldn't do anything despite having a full hand of cards, which seemed off. Based on videos I've seen it has the potential to be a solid climbing game that works for two players, but it didn't quite feel like it when I played.

I think this is actually pretty good, but the rules were tough to sort out. I'm not sure I've quite figured it all out, and I worry that it might just make the most sense to try and wait as long as possible to play your cards, but I did find it a mildly interesting climbing game.

Oh my goodness the art for this game is FANTASTIC.  The mechanism for determining the better wrestler is fun and interesting.  

Sadly, I don't think there is much of a game here.  You very quickly run out of choices/decisions.  We experimented with variants: more cards dealt to each player seems to help.  

We played several hands open to determine if game is too luck based or if we were missing something.  We ran several scenarios for each hand (we're geeky like that) and concluded there is too much luck.  Maybe the maximum number of players gives better results?  I really want to play this but it needs adjustments... Ideas?

This is a cool little quick-playing trick-taking card game! It takes some getting used to, but it helps when one player (Joe!) can tell you what the legal plays are every turn! But once you catch on, it makes sense (more or less). Fun!

[b]--- Rules (for my Game of Thrones version) ---[/b]
[floatright][imageid=2200405][/floatright]Players represent powers secretly manipulating the great Houses through a series of Wars (each hand is a War). In a 2-player game, the first player to win 2 Wars wins the game. With 3-6 players, the player with the most VP after 4 Wars wins the game! 

1.	Each hand, shuffle the entire deck and deal cards to each player (2-4 players = 10, 5er = 9, 6er = 8). Set all House banner tokens aside.
2.	In the first hand, a random player plays first. In later hands, the player who went out last in the previous hand leads. Play each hand until everyone has sloughed all their cards.
3.	Whenever LEADING in a trick, play n cards of same House; n = 
	a.	ONE if that suit that has not debuted (i.e., been played before during this hand; it’s House banner token is still set aside). Immediately place that House’s banner in the play area.
	b.	1, 2, or 3 if that suit has debuted.
4.	Whenever FOLLOWING in a trick, you may either pass for the rest of trick, or play. If playing, play a set of House cards:
	a.	You must play a House that has not been played yet during this trick.
	b.	If your House is stronger than House currently winning the trick, you must play exactly n cards.
	c.	If your House strength is unknown relative to the led house (or banner still set aside), you must play exactly n + 1 cards (max. 3). House’s strength is now known to be greater than the House currently winning the trick: use the House banners to indicate the Houses’ relative strengths, placing the stronger House to the left.
5.	The trick winner leads for the next trick. 
6.	The first player to slough all their cards gets a +2 VP card. The next gets a +1 VP card. The last player to go out gets a -1 VP card and will lead in the next hand: repeat above. (In 2-player game, ignore VP cards; just play for 2 wins.)

RATING: 4
Climbing game with coloured wrestler cards. Initially all cards are the same value, but each hand establishes a pecking order: if the ranking is unknown, two cards of a colour (say, pink) beats one card of another (blue), and three green cards beats both. For the rest of the round, green beats pink beats blue.

It's a cute idea but in practice the game all but plays itself. Gorgeous production from Oink, as ever -- and apparently based on real luchadors -- can't cover up the lack of game.

RATING: N/A
[Oink Games 17 edition] {Japan; shedding; optimal 4p} Maskmen is a fun shedding game from Japan. The ever change of mask ranking is dynamic enough.

The rules may be confusing for new players, especially about how the rank of wrestlers is determined.  The rule can be clearer: who will lead after one player has gone out; that a season ends when everyone except one has gone out; etc.

The edition includes 6x5 wrestler markers.  I don't think that's really necessary.  6 wrestler markers are quite enough.

The card stock is thick enough for durable plays.  However, the card illustration is too pedestrian.  It's not attractive at all.  The scoring markers are too tiny.  I don't want carry this game around to play because I am afraid I will lose those markers.

RATING: 5
Game that somehow feels quite similar to The Great Dalmuti, but without the easy going flow that accompanies that game. 

Novelty in this game is that you only set the value of the cards when playing, so this allows for a whole new layer of strategy. Problem is, The Great Dalmuti doesn't need another layer of strategy, it is fine for what it is (a time-killer when you're waiting on something). 

The way the relative strengths of the wrestlers are measured does require some spatial aptitude: I found I had no problem with it but two of my gaming buddies (one of which an experienced gamer himself) had a hard time figuring out the strengths and their play options.

All in all, they couldn't wrap their head around the strength, while I didn't care for the extra strategy. Game is good if you look for the following:

- small, portable filler, easy to learn yet requiring a lot of strategy.
- novel way of setting strengths 'on the fly' compared to the fixed 'ranking' of cards nearly always present.
- oink games. Small brilliant game-design concepts packaged in small boxes without any excess air (FFG take note).

Not good if:
- spatial reasoning is hard for you
- you look for bigger games to deliver you strategy

RATING: 4.5
The joy of so many of these minimalistic card games is the simple and surprisingly deep game play that comes from so few components. The masks look wonderful on the table and are really eye-catching, but it feels very much as though the designer came up with these and then tried to build a game around them. In too many instances it is unclear how to position the masks to show their strength or how to actually determine the strengths of the wrestlers involved. And to make it worse, once you do decide, the information is so unclear on the table (with wrestlers being staggered everywhere before all have entered) that it becomes entirely unwieldy. There might well be something interesting in there, but I couldn't find it.

Disclaimer: we used some fairly rough translations from the video and so if new (English) rules have been released the game may now be a lot smoother.

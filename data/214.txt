Light tile-laying game with a simple, but fitting theme (although the segregation is a bit weird).

Each turn, lay a tile either at the bar (initially low positive points, but soon they become increasing negative points), or lay 1 or two tiles at tables, following several limiting placement rules.  Tiles laid score more points the more matching people are already at the table(s) (there are prime seats in between 2 different tables).  After each turn you re-tile again to replenish up to how many you already had.  If you're lucky enough to fill a table with all people of the same nationality (2 males, 2 females, always), then you have 1 less tile to play with, which is a good thing, but it limits your options.  The game ends when someone is out of tiles, or the bar is filled.  There are joker tiles, which are mint to have, and a turn can also be used to trade a tile for a joker.

This is definitely a light, tactical game that can't be taken too seriously.  There is some opportunity for crafty play, but it is definitely dependent on tile draws.

Basically you have to fill up a coffee house: you have visitors from different countries whom have to be accomodated by the tables. Everyone wants to sit with its fellow countryman, but this is not always possible, so you have to watch out for other combinations too. And to complicate things further, there are male and female guest and so the tables must be gender-balanced. It is a good family game combining tile placement and pattern building.

Häufig in CLZ gespielt. Man benötigt zwar eine Menge Glück um die richtigen Tischpartner zu finden und wenn man die dann nicht bekommt kann es leicht ins Destruktive driften indem dann zur Not die Tische der anderen Spieler blockiert werden.
Aber das Spiel stammt ja auch noch aus der Zeit wo es das Prinzip von Koopspielen noch nicht gab.
Es ist ein einfaches Spiel das man auch Neuspielern sehr schnell erklären kann.
Die schönen Zeichnungen und der geheimnisvolle Sacke zum Ziehen der Tischpartner machen letzendlich den Reiz des Spiels aus.

i actually enjoy this game, and i would play it more often if someone opened the box.  that's the problem though, it's one of those games that for whatever reason i don't open the box.  it's got a lot of luck but it's quite fun, and the xenophobic theme is pretty amusing.  i think i'm personally better off just playing it at bsw though.

I actually had very low expectations for this game. It's a very basic tile placement game, at least it seems so after reading the rules. Yet in actual play this is a really good design. It challenges you to consider a lot of things before you play, like "am I setting up my opponent for an easy score?" or "should I draw a new tile, or start decreasing my number of tiles?" That balancing act in particular is one of my favorite aspects of the game. You have to find the right moment to not take a new tile because, while it will decrease your penalty at the end of the game, it also limits your options and puts you at risk of playing too many tiles to the bar (losing lots of points.) The tiles even have a fun cartoony vibe that, as my brother put it, offers equal opportunity offensive stereotypes for every nation, and that makes me laugh. Frankly, the only thing I don't like about this game are the chips they include for keeping score. Small, multi-colored chips that have no discernable way of determining how much they are worth isn't my idea of a good score system. Otherwise, this game is a winner.

Odd this made the SdJ award. But then, the 80s weren't great in terms of games. We're now in the golden age of gaming. Those were the dark ages where even this game could make the award.

Most turns in this game give me a very minor choice. Play this card for points, where one spot will obviously give me the most points, or discard a card and lose points.

Other turns give me no choice at all, discard a card and get penalized (lose points).

It felt very luck of the draw.

Pretty good. The theme and presentation are terrific. The gameplay is very fast, and in all takes only about 30 minutes to setup/play. There is a problem with the endgame when there are only a few open seats left, and the players just seeing who can be lucky enough to draw them first. I need to think of a way to fix this. But until the point, there is some room for skillful plays. Nice for such a light game.

Café International had been sitting unplayed on my shelves for a long time. When I finally decided to bust this open with my wife, I played it 5 times in the first week! Most of my plays have been against my wife, but I’ve also tried it with 3 players. I think it works very well with both numbers, although I suspect the 4p game to be a little too chaotic for my taste. Especially with 2 players, you have control over the state of the board and can think a little ahead – although your strategy of course depends on the tiles you draw. So, yeah, there is luck in this game, but as you always know which tiles your opponents have, you can somewhat plan around it. 

It sucks when you draw crappy tiles and are forced to place them in the bar, but it’s not too common, and, again, if you have a plan you can make some great moves! I like that you have to sit persons sort of in pairs (which is the main rule the whole game is built around I guess). 

It’s a nice, casual and puzzle-like game which only takes ~20 minutes or so with my wife. It’s not too confrontational, although you can make some “mean” plays which obstruct your opponents’ plans (i.e. placing a woman somewhere so they cannot place a woman too at that table). I guess the only “downside” is that, with 2 players, the game always ends when one of you don’t have any more tiles left. The game states that it can end in 4 ways, but after 5 plays it has always been this was; with 4 the game would probably be a little more open to various endings. It’s just a minor quibble. And I actually really like the fact that you get less and less power the fewer tiles you have as there are fewer places to place your guests; it’s sort of a catch-up-mechanism which is always a good thing.

This SdJ winner is a tile-laying game featuring a bunch of people from various countries who are all very nationalistic.  They generally only want to sit with their own countrymen, with exceptions where those spheres intersect.  They also believe in gender parity, so no putting two men at a table until a woman is there!

The strategy is trying to score as many points as you can for a table but not open it up for your opponents - because first at a table is worth one amount of points, two is worth more, etc.  And a perfect table of just one country means big points and the chance to reduce your hand size.  But will you take that risk and reduce your flexibility to play?

Great fun from a game that's been around for decades.  I'd play it again without hesitation.

This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.

Egy remek példa arra, hogyan lehet egyszerű szabályokkal nagyszerű játékot alkotni. Tökéletesen alkalmas idősebb szülőkkel való együtt játszásra. Mondjuk kedves Édesanyámnak nehezen ment át, hogy egy asztalnál két hölgy férfi társaság nélkül nem ülhet, mert folyton azzal próbálkozott, ami nem csoda, hiszen jóformán csak női karaktereket húzott a zsákból. Apropó zsák. A szerencse bele van kódolva a játékba a zsákból húzás miatt, de ez inkább csak a játék vége felé volt zavaró, amikor már sok olyan karakter van kihúzva, amit már nem lehet lerakni, mivel már beteltek az adott nemzetiségű asztalok, így csak negatív pontokat érnek. Felhívnám a figyelmet, hogy a joker lapkának is van neme, így erre oda kell figyelni a felhasználásánál. Mivel a játék elején még öt lapka közül lehet választani, hogy kit ültessünk asztalhoz, később ez változik, amennyiben sikerül azonos nemzetiségből álló asztalokat létrehozni, ezért ügyesen lehet taktikázni azzal, hogy "blokkolunk" egy-egy asztalt, nehogy másokat nagyobb előnyben részesítsük. A játék a könnyen felfogható szabályaival, gyors játékmenetével kifejezetten a nagyszülőkkel való játékra ajánlott. (2016.12.26.)

Played once.  The game was OK -- I suspect we were doing something wrong, because we didn't have to place people onto the "bar" until very late in the game, and then that seemed to be the only option, as the rest of the board was filled up.

Prefer Cafe Melange for this type of iterative logic game involving relative placement.  Not really much choice as to how the tiles play; if there's an opportunity to play, you do.

This SdJ winner had much more to offer than expected. There were quite interesting dilemmas going on, and really satisfying when you find the right combo. A little frustrating toward the end of the game, when there are fewer "big points" to acquire, but more and more minus points in the bar. An ok game.

Played 3 times. German classic that is aging a bit. Seat guests at tables for points. Only knock against it is how many negative points gets rung up on players at the end. Makes a fun family game a bit of an endgame nightmare, but and enough luck to be on the annoying side sometimes. Best as a family game.

Oddly enough, I played countless games of the card game edition before I played the original.  The similarities are many; in fact apart from the bar and the jokers, the game is exactly the same.  Which is not a bad thing in anyway because this is a game that my daughters will gladly play.  Getting pre-teens to sit down and play games is an achievement in itself, but I have found a few games that are well-received.

Café International is a blast from the past: A fairly simple tile-laying puzzle that relies very much on the luck of the draw, especially the closer the game comes to its end or when playing with some of the variants that seriously unbalance the game towards one lucky shot in the game. It's a game that hasn't aged all that well and has been superceded by the likes of Carcassonne.

I was happy to play CI once, given that it is an early SdJ winner and a minor prelude of German games to come. Overall, it is pleasant and rather abstract. It's an easy-going tile laying game. I do think however that at it's worst it is rather dependent on the tiles you draw. At it's best it is a open-face tile game where the player player is that who can best analyze the board and their opponent's pieces. This isn't inherently a problem with games in general, but CI is so simple that everyone knows the "best move" will make itself clear with only a little bit of analysis.  It's analysis young and old are capable of. With games like this, I'd rather the best move was never blindingly apparent. We were able to successfully analyze the board and other player tiles each time, meaning with this out of the way, the luck of the tiles dominated. Yeah- there's  a little push-your-luck here and there with holding off on playing a tile, hoping your opponent will play one that will give you more points later on, but it's such a minor thing in this game and there are much better games that do everything CI does, but better. An interesting game for its time but very much surpassed now.

RATING: 6.5
This game is fun....but luck dependent. This is especially irksome at the end of the game when there are only a few seats left and you have nothing but useless cards remaining and the bar has nothing but big minus numbers for the patrons that you are going to have to sit there. Your hard won, well thought out lead disappears in a deluge of -6, -8 and -10 plays. The frustration during a recent play with minuses and more minuses finally reduces this game and its about time!

This is a good and simple game to play. There's a little more strategy involved, than the game gets credit for, by having all players tiles face up in front of them. You can try and plan ahead and not set up your opponents next turn. Plus a few other little things, that I'm not going to go into, but it should become apparent, after a play or two.

This would make a good family game or one to teach to beginners of the hobby. I enjoyed it quite a bit and am glad to have finally got a copy.

Fun little tile game, a little of set collection but only a little as it is far more a tactical grab type game. A game of opportunites a little similar to Austraila with a HUGE caveat, you are subject to the tile draw which is ridiculously reliant on luck, more so than other games of this type.  

Playable with 2, 3 might be okay but bordering chaotic and 4 would be crazy.  Mind you everyone is subject to the same chaos so if your okay with that then it plays like a light filler.  Not to be taken seriously for sure, just a light little game to play, definite gateway but the luck and chaos really put it as something I can’t recommend, much better gateway or fillers around.

A very intriguing game.  The feature where you lose a card if you make a big play is very interesting.  I haven't figured this game out yet, and my results have been quite discouraging.  However, I have quite a bit of respect for this game - it is obvious that it requires a lot of skill.  It takes a real balancing act to win.  I feel that the luck aspect of the game only subtracts from its enjoyability - if you draw lots of wildcards, you are just lucky.  It is not like backgammon or streetsoccer, where you can position yourself to take advantage of good luck, it just happens to you.

Really liked this game as a kid: very simple rules, very replayable (at that time). I haven't played it for a decade. This game has some emotional/sentimental value for me. It really introduced me to games other than roll dice/move games and abstract games. It wasn't until 'the Great Dalmuti' that I discovered the world of boardgames.

Edit: after years I played it again. I still like the game, but adjusted the rating according my rating-system. There is a luck factor: drawing the tiles. It does mitigate the different skill of players. There are some nice tactical decisions: will I play this guest now or shall I wait a round? Or shall I put my guest at the bar right now, so I can profit from the plus points?

Tip: Always draw a card less when you make an international table!

I can now confidently say that this is the game that started my boardgaming flame.

Pretty simple light game with a small bit of nastiness.  It is funny how the different nationalities are portrayed.  Some people may take offense to the artwork but I don't have an issue.  They are done in a cartoon style.  Heck, don't all French women smoke?  

Hmmm.... I wonder how a Canadian would look in this game???

I'm a sucker for games where you have to manage luck, so I like Cafe International. I've been playing CI on BSW and quickly learned that there is a fair amount of strategy here. I try to keep my options open by not finishing off "one-nationality" tables until the end game approaches; this strategy helps limit the randomness of the tile draw.

I slighly disagree that the game promotes segregation and/or xenophobia. See my review for further thoughts on this.

A cute game, and very European in its segregation of nationalities around cafe tables.  It is the "Ticket to Ride" for the 6 - 10 crowd, at least in my experience.  About as abstract and dry, but with a goofiness that the kids I've played with respond to.  So if a non-gaming family showed up with kids, this could be a game to pull out.  Not much replay, though.

RATING: 8
The name of the game says it all: guests of mixed nationalities have to be accomodated in tables of their own countries, the fuller the better, always keeping a similar measure of men and women in each table. If they don't (want to) fit anywhere, they have to take a seat in the bar (very nice at first, catastrophic in the end).

One of the summits of the pre-Siedler gaming landscape in Germany, Café International is an excellent offering that can be explained in barely two minutes and teases the players with its blend of quick play and cheeky artwork; the exaggeratedly stereotypical pictures would possibly be considered politically incorrect nowadays. However, the game isn't the light fare it seems to be after the first plays: a very frail balance between filling the tables and the bar at the right time and keeping the right tiles long enough needs to be achieved to avoid the luck of the draw towards the end of the game (which can be huge, to the point of deciding the winner).

RATING: 5.4
Vecchio gioco che lascia trasparire tutti i suoi anni e che è fortemente governato dalla fortuna sotto forma di pesca tessere. I giocatori appunto dovranno pescare delle tessere e posizionarle sul tabellone rispettando le poche regole del gioco. A seconda del piazzamento si percepiranno soldi/punti vittoria. Un gioco con poca longevità e un tantino ripetitivo.

Although the tiles are random, and the result semi-random, there's quite a bit of tile review going on throughout the game, especially with 4 gamers at the table. It's theoretically a lighter game to close out a night (especially given the theme and fun artwork), but it nonetheless ends up being a bit of a planner, plotting a best move given other players' tiles. It's likeable, but too random to be anything close to a main feast, and was traded away after a while.

It's very tactical where you try to see what you have and what your opponent have and act accordingly. Anyone ignoring what other people are doing will lose. The drawing is very stereotypical that it is offensive/racist. I will just have to say we came a long way from 1989 to 2014.

An Early SdJ winner, and still a pretty good game. Players take turns seating various guests at nationality-specific tables, trying to gain points for the compatibility of the guests, or alternately placing them at the bar. Things can get tough as the tables fill and guests have to be placed in increasingly unprofitable chairs at the bar.

Fair game.  Easy to play and often you just play the only tile you can.  I wasn't at all offended by the artwork for stereotyping, but it was atrocious in that it hindered game play (I can't always tell what is supposed to be a woman and the colors for spain and turkey are too similar).  They could have just used very different colors (or the flags) and a big Ã¢Â™Â€ or Ã¢Â™Â‚ symbol (that was supposed to be male and female symbols) to make it easy on us players.

A fun game in which players place cards to score points. The cards must be placed at the right tables and can never be lonely, and they score more and more points the fuller the tables get. It is easy to learn but quite challenging. There is quite a large luck element and the rules are quite badly written but if you can get over the pretty poor racial stereotypes (it was written in the 1980s) on some of the cards it is quite a good game.

I'm fascinated by the sideways approach this game takes to its subject matter. As the box says "All are welcome here," but we'd probably get along better if we weren't at the same table. That said, this is a very basic tile-laying game. It'd be disingenuous to say the best move is usually obvious, because very often the player only has one or two possibilities in the first place. It feels disappointingly deterministic, which is a shame since I think there's something here I'd like more if it were made with more nuance.

The illustrations are pretty tacky by today's standards, in a way that reminds me of Punch-Out!! on the NES. They aren't really malicious, but they are still in poor taste.

I have had a lot of fun with this game.  When we play, we try to max out our points every turn.  This leads to some poor tactical decisions as it often leaves great opportunities for our opponents.  I think it would be interesting to play this once in a tactical manner.  Somehow, I just don't think it would be near as fun.  That right now is its greatest asset--it is just a lot of fun to play, light and breezy.

High marks for the intuitive rules and the way the game plays out (increasing tension and difficulty as the game progresses).  Luck of the draw can get frustrating especially at the beginning of the game.  Often there is just one obvious move for you (but it's still fun to find it).  The characteratures in the game art (especially the ones for the Chinese customers) are nauseating to my sensitive stomach.  Oh well.

24 éves év játékát sikerült kipróbálni. Mindent elmond róla, hogy eszembe nem jutna, hogy ez egy ilyen idős játék. Tökéletesen megállja a helyét a mai játékok között. A játékosok véletlenszerű öt tokenből próbálnak 1-2-őt lerakni a körükben. Különböző nemzetiségű embereket kell leültetni egy kávézó asztalaihoz. Egy-egy asztal körül 4 szék van, amiből kettőre egymás melletti nemzetiségű férfia vagy nő ülhet, míg másik kettőre csak adott nemzetiségű. Így kiszorítósdi veszi kezdetét. Annyi pontot kapunk, ahányan már az asztalnál ülnek, plusz egyet, illetve ennek a dupláját, ha csak saját nemzetbeli ül egy helyen. Ha nem tudunk rakni egy jól kitalált mínusz pontokat adó helyre kell ültetünk egy emberünket. A játék gyors, pörgős, tökéletes minden játszható játékosszámmal, egyszerű. Negatívumnak csak a szerencsefüggőséget lehet hozni, ami viszont családi kategóriában tökéletes mértékű, illetve, hogy a pontozása macerás, mert 100 pont körüli értékek miatt, tokeneket használnák rá. Van ugye negatív pont is, így elég sokat kell szüttyögni a győzelmi pontokkal. Kellemes, jó játékot ismerhettem meg a Café Internationalban. Erős 6-os.

A fun enough little puzzle game.  The theme on this abstract game makes it almost believable.  I like to think of this as a Swingers club.  Although it is strangely xenophobic.  Purely tactics with little to no deep strategy, but engaging enough to be diversionary.  Due to the fact that this is a tile drawing game, as with any kind of luck of the draw, sometimes you get boned.  A couple neat paths to victory.  If you don't mind an occasional game where you are just fated to lose, then this is decent fun.

Since it's not a game unless I foul up the rules, my initial play of this one skewed because I forgot the rule about drawing one less tile when you make a "Nation Table" which threw things quite off kilter.  Perhaps we will get it back out to see if things run a bit better with the proper rules.

This is a fairly light tile-laying game, which I liked a lot more than I thought I would.  The key with light games, for me, is that they have to be quick enough to not outstay their welcome.  Cafe International meets this criterion in spades, as we usually feel the need to play several times in a row before we're ready to move on to something else.

There are some interesting mechanics going on here but it was not enough fun to get over the really weird theme (the Chinese want to sit with the Chinese???

I wish they had found a better theme, shouldn't be that hard (place animals in a zoo would be one coming to my mind), still, I am not sure I would like it that much more no matter what theme.

Any simple tile laying game where I finish a dismal last, helped by a dumb error, has to be good. Wonderfully politically incorrect racial stereotyping on the cartoon artwork.

remember you can add points after each of 2 tile plays.

[one play] An interesting puzzle-like challenge of trying to set up good scoring combinations. It would be easy to get caught up in AP trying to figure out which placements would set up other players for points; the game might be funner player ignoring other players tiles. This isn't one I'd actively seek to play, but I can see why it won the SdJ.

&quot;Played really badly with two players. Maybe better with more players. I don&#039;t see any lasting fun in this game. Rating 4&quot;

That was my earlier rating. Boy, was I wrong! Since then I have played this a lot with everyone - friends, family, people at conventions and so on. All loved it and so did I. It&#039;s up there with Settlers and Bohnanza when it comes to being able to play it with anyone, anywhere.

This is a somewhat luck filled SDJ winner.  Since drawing tiles near the end of the game can be worth significant negative points if they don't fit on the board, you can get some crazy end-game point swings simply based on the tile draw.  Still, it's kind of fun.

Cafe International heralds from a time before modern gaming, and this tile-laying treasure is a logician's paradise.  The rules are simple and would appeal to a Scrabble player.  The delicious choices are energizing.  The endgame may feel random but the entirety of the game is a skillful affair.  A must-have.

To quote the ever quotable Yogi Berra,  "Nobody goes there anymore...it's too crowded".

Keep that in mind when you plan a night out at Cafe International and be sure to only make reservations for two.  As a two player contest,  this simple tile laying entry approaches elite status in the light weight game department.

With it's no-frills rules and singular path to victory,  this game is an engaging, relaxing and often,   addicting experience.  In reality,  the fact that it is  essentially basic in nature,  is most likely the key to it's charm. 

There are no special rules to remember - no frivolous conditions which can lead to a cascade of effects.  In many games that may equate to a bland experience,  but in this instance,  they are actually the game's strengths. 

If you were looking for a brain burning session,  you were let off at the wrong stop.  However,  if it was a simple and pleasant jaunt that you sought - commence to disembark - and prepare to enjoy.

First Impression:

Vastly superior compared to the cardgame. The theme is half working and the game feels fresh despite being "old". There is strategy and tactics, and the game feels rewarding when you manage to accomplish them. The two variants are a must.

Luck plays significant role in refreshing the common guest pool, and somewhat less in defining the starting guest pools. Keeping track of score is fiddly (a track around the board would be nice). The scoring system itself is also fiddly and not intuitive.

It's quite light and abstract and enjoyable as such, but the pasted-on theme (and art) is not pleasant: diners at a restaurant are represented by tiles depicting national stereotypes, and your objectives in the game include seating heterosexual couples at segregated tables. The scoring rules in the English translation are a little unclear, but I guess they make sense if you believe that social occasions go better when you stick to your own sort.

This one we picked up a while ago at a flea market. An, almost, new copy for the price of 1 (one) Euro. The only thing I knew about this game, was the fact that it had won the Spiel des Jahres award a long time ago. Didn’t expect much of this game before I opened the box, and after reading the rules, I became a bit more interested in it. The rules aren’t hard to understand and explain. In a players turn, a player:

    Places 1 or 2 guest at 1 or 2 tables of the correct nationality. Or
    Place 1 guest at the bar. Or
    Exchange a joker.

Then:

    He replenish his hand. If he manages to complete a table with a single nationality, he may decrease his hand with one guest.

After having done this, a player scores points. If the game comes to a end, the players score -5 points for every guest they have in their hand, and -10 points for every jokey they have in their hand.

This game plays fast, there is not that much challenge in it, but it is fun enough to enjoy it on regular base.

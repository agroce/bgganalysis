RATING: 8
I bought Century: Spice Road on the hope of it being a "splendor-killer", or another great light-midweight game to join 7 Wonders/Tokaido/etc in introducing new gamers to the hobby. This one totally delivers: with a satisfying engine-building, an addicting trading mechanism, and a quick playtime, Century: Spice Road gives you everything you would want in a 30 minute game.

I love how you have to adapt your strategies to the cards that are available in the purchase row (both the action cards and the point cards). There's also a satisfying game tension where you focus on card purchases in the first half and then load up on point cards in the later rounds. Coins (and spices left on your board) play a very important role in the game, especially when 2 or 3 points can make the difference! 

We've played at every step of 2-5 player counts, and I appreciate the balance of all of them. Lower play counts, far from being boring, are easier to keep an eye on what your opponent is doing. But conversely, at high play counts you can discretely accrue an engine without people getting wise to the cards in your hand. 

There is some adjustment that players need to make after a few plays: I've found the multiple conversions rule to be especially hard for players to adapt to (to their detriment, as it's a crucial part of most victories). That said, this is a game that my grandma could play -- and that's not hypothetical: she has! 

Someone totally new to gaming can sit down at Century and have a pretty fun first game, and know exactly what to do by their second game. This is the prototypical 'gateway' game that I've been looking for, and I foresee a lot of play in its future. Best yet, it's entertaining for gamers as well, with the competition to collect spices just as intense as you want to make it.

Century Spice Road hits the exact balance you'd want in a 30-minute engine-builder. Much like 7 Wonders, the prospect of building your own personal game style is an appealing one. Though it's a simple game, there are some strategic intricacies we have yet to tease out of the game.

Excellent gateway game or light game for more experienced gamers. Takes about five minutes to teach (perhaps less). Everyone picks up the game easily. I have now played it with both serious gamers who enjoyed it as a nice relaxing engine-builder and with people completely new to gaming, who had no trouble being competitive. The game length feels right: it's slow enough that it allows you to build a nice engine and use it, but fast enough that it ends before it overstays its welcome. Very happy with this game. Reminds me of splendor, but I think I like it better (although that might be because I've simply played splendor far too many times). One thing keeps it from being a ten: lackluster theme. There were so many more interesting themes possible that the spice trading theme seems like a missed opportunity. I tend to make up more exciting themes when playing with my group and we pretend to be trading something other than spices.

RATING: 7
9+ plays / 2,3,4,5 players

LIKE: Quick, simple system that anyone can jump into. I like figuring out the conversions and looking for good combinations. The engine-building cards are fun when you amass a big hand. Subtle strategies emerge, but it is clearly a race.

DISLIKE: The game seemed static and predictable at two players, especially when no one was buying new market cards, but once players realize the power of cards, the market is much more interesting. Players cannot be slowed down when almost getting a point card, so the interaction is a bit low.

OVERALL: At first I thought the 2-player game was static, but after seeing the value of cards and the speed which better market cards can create cubes and claim points, I think 2 player and 3-player work just fine. I still favor Splendor because it feels more dynamic from turn to turn.

Very similar to Splendor.  My thoughts on Splendor and this are pretty much identical.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It works and is quick and fairly brain burning in a pretty concentrated and maybe slightly pressurised way.  It's basically a contract making and engine building game.
I'd be happy to play it, but it's also maybe a little generic and I think some of the cards are probably quite over-powered.
I'd rather play something which has a few more varied strategies in it.

Initial rating based on 3 plays. Gets much faster with repeated plays. A beautiful game with many component upgrade, content expansion, and rule variant possibilities.

Gameplay is shallow, though, this is essentially a longplay filler. Very little player interaction (practically zero), feels like playing solitaire. Also seems to be optimizable ... once you find out how to be efficient, I think you'd always play it the same way each time.

I enjoyed this, although I simply do not understand engine-building games at all.  I do like that there are timing and anticipation elements (will anyone be able to take that order card, or can I wait another turn?), and you can play the table to relatively good effect.

I'd gladly play again, but I would not own because, well, I really have no idea what happened or why I did as well as I did.

RATING: 9
A fantastic engine-building, short game!  I really love the goal and how the engine-building is integrated with the choices players make.  My only annoyance is that there's no balance in the cards - some are strictly better than others.  This means: (1) Your strategy is dictated by the cards available to you.  (2) Your ultimate success may be contingent on you getting "better" cards than the other players.  There's definitely some strategy involved, but if one player can play a card for 4x yellow cubes and another can only get 2x cubes for a single play, which one is definitively in a better position?

It is short enough, and fun enough, that I'm willing to put up with the above.  Play, have fun, move on to the next.

Century SR is a quick gateway card game of resource conversion and engine building that sports some interesting characteristics :

- there is deckbuilding, but no shuffling -> fast and neat!
- no handsize limit -> reduces AP, helping the game fly

The game plays well at 2p, and results tight despite taking different strategies.

The cards have wonderful illustrations, even though theme takes a back seat as soon as you ref up your engine to convert those cubes into more cubes in order to harvest points for the win!

It's great worknight game with super simple rules that you can play 2-5 with kids and adults in under one hour: a very sought after type of games!

Great game, but I haven't subscribed to the whole splendor-killer nonsense, it's a fast game and the challenge to make an efficient engine in the short amount of time is great, the game speeds up a lot but you can always see the ending coming, and it seems well balanced. great component quality and gorgeous with he playmat. It's a great gateway. All that said I still prefer Splendor, but the whole trilogy thing is really interesting and I can't wait to see where it's going.

Reminiscent of Bazaar (3M/Discovery Toys/Gryphon) and Splendor (Asmodee). It is not as good as the former and better than the latter. Players draft cards to later play them to get combinations of spice in order to redeem the spice for victory points.

A pleasant, easy to teach, filler that is perhaps a bit too soulless and abstracted to be fully embraced.  I found the game kind of fun to play without a thought or concern in the world such that you build a deck of 10 or so cards, and just keep converting cubes into cubes into cubes into more cubes, and so on until you satisfy the goal cards.

Good thing somebody is converting cubes into other cubes because, uhm...why are we doing this again?  We are training for bigger euros here.  Think of this as resource conversion calisthenics.  Convert and convert and convert and convert.  And what do the cubes represent?  Spices?  Okay, if you say so.  Nice art by the way.

Easily kicks Splendor to the curb. There is zero theme to the game and it's simply trade cubes for other cubes to buy things because. The rules very briefly try to pretend there's a theme by giving each coloured cube a name, then abandon it and refer to them by colour, Very simple to understand and play.

In Century: Spice Road, players are caravan leaders who travel the famed silk road to deliver spices to the far reaches of the continent for fame and glory. Each turn, players perform one of four actions: 1) taking a marketcard, 2) play a card from hand, 3) claim a victory point card, 4) or rest: by taking back into your hand all of the cards you've played.
The last round is triggered once a player has claimed their fifth/sixth victory point card, then whoever has the most victory points wins.
This game has the feel of Splendor, but is more complex, and a lot faster to play.

Excellent closer if played quickly.  Simple choices.  Its all about getting the best synergy with your production cards.  Nice components especially with the game mat.  Rating includes the following fix:

After around 20 plays it seems evident that if one player has, or one player doesn't have a second production (merchant) card YYY, RY, GY, G, or B, etc., (or the triple upgrade card) then the player without a second production card is very unlikely to win the game or even be competitive.

To fix this the player who is playing last draws a number of the production cards equal to the number of players and includes these in the row of 6 merchant draw cards in any positions they choose.  In this way all players have the option of getting a second production card (to go with their starting YY card). As a result everyone has the opportunity to get a good engine going and the game becomes competitive with everyone having a better chance to develop a good engine.

This is a great game - filler or closer - which could have been even better. Hopefully this or a similar fix will be included in the forthcoming expansions. Maybe best just to include as a 'gamers' variant so as to leave the family version in its purest, but unbalanced form.  I do think with the rule a SdJ nomination would have been in the bag. A shame it missed out.

The Spice Road is a lighter game, in the same category of Splendor, with which it shares quite a few resemblances.
It is essentially a drafting engine-building game, where in the first part each player drafts the cards he will use as an engine, then turning the engine in victory points.
So, nothing fancy or strikingly innovative.
Nevertheless, the gameplay is fast and engaging, and there is manuevering room fo clever plays.
The production value is quite high. The artwork by Fernanda Suarez is striking, and the rest of the components (including the box) is very nice and well crafted.

Very good game but a bit fiddly and the publishers have been very naive in their design of the insert - one of the worst I've  ever come across and so easily rectified at no extra cost in the production. Also more cubes are needed and larger containers. (Who on earth carries "candy" around to use for extra spice!? A very weird idea, just for the sake of providing a few extra cubes!).

I'm also wondering if you don't get a good production card at the beginning will it be difficult to compete. For now, it's okay and I will probably purchase it if I could find the neoprene mat and game for a good price; if not, I'm not getting it.

In its essence, Century is Splendor with spices, although it’s a little more challenging than the latter, since it requires to actually spend resources to buy cards, which introduces the real problem with this game: its fiddliness and constant need for thinking how to optimize your colored cubes, hence ignoring any kind of socialization.

This is a textbook example of how a multiplayer solitaire feels and plays like.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------------
The combo creation in this game is much more interesting than Splendor.  The race in the game is intense, and if you fall just a bit behind, I don't think there is any real way to catch up.  This is a good game, but I do think it was overhyped for sure.  For sure going to keep it for awhile, but I don't envision if ending up on my top games of 2017 unless the rest of this year just ends up not being that great.

RATING: 5.5
Very disappointed by this game and the way the  mechanics conspire to diminish tactical interest and game play while elevating the luck factor. After putting it away we felt like the game had played us more than we had played the game.

The "Bazaar" mechanic is a fun one and combining it with a card driven engine builder is an interesting conceptual idea. Unfortunately it is largely downhill from that point on because the sum of the parts is significantly less than the whole. It's failure to please could be a simple case of combining the right idea with the wrong mechanics, or the wrong variations of the right mechanics.

I am inclined to suspect that the initial "Splendor Killer" moniker and the follow on belief in a sure thing did the game far more harm than good. It's a shame, because a sterner development route could have resolved its issues leading to a genuinely good game instead of one that just manages to scrape above average.

I've already offloaded the game, but I am still interested in the future titles in the Century line. I only hope that lessons will be learned and more attention is paid to the mathematics that underpin a game and the way that multiple mechanics work synergistically to elevate or eradicate interesting game play. Good for people who don't like tactical game play, little to no player interaction and a huge luck factor. 

The art work is very nice though, well done Fernanda, and the promotion has been excellent. 

Portal of Heroes, Bazaar, Splendor and Viceroy are all substantially better. If the game garners a SDJ recomendation for Emerson I will be very happy for him (he seems like a great guy with a deep love of gaming), but very surprised.

One of the most overrated and overhyped games ever. Uses trading mechanics existent in almost all euro games out there, and very bare, just too plain to enjoy for any who has a wide exposure to euro games.

Enjoy the play of this game, find it much more forgiving than Splendor.  The game is still easy to learn, plays fast, and is really nice to look at.  The art is superb and the design is smooth.

A well designed game that plays smoothly and finishes at the right time.  The game play naturally falls into two phases - the first where you build an engine of cards, and the second where you run it to buy points.  There are some nice considerations that are not immediately obvious such as:
- taking a card with 2 yellow cubes on it is often worth it for the cubes, even if you never play the card.  It doesn't "clog" your hand up, or impede progress in any way.  
- Coins are worth prioritizing, but you also need to know what other players are going for.  
- As a corollary, sometimes it's worth it to stall so coin cards get bought and a non-coin card you can buy slides over into a coin slot. 
- There is a nice balance between trying for lots of small value cards to end the game quickly, and buying big point cards to be efficient.

After 5 games, I like this a lot.  It is an excellent filler-length engine builder that offers a little more thinking than Splendor.

I can see why this is called a Splendor-killer. Same type of death, stripped-down actions, and engine building. Would buy someday, likely the Golem edition as apparently the components are better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Feels like a slightly more random and 'foggy' version of Splendor.

The cube conversion cards can be fun to play around with, but also feel difficult to value effectively. I imagine this would get easier with more plays but I think some of the problem has to do with my main complaint: the demand cards that give you victory points.

The point swing on the cards is pretty big, which is fine in a game like Splendor where there are different rows with similar values. In this game though the two people before you might buy the better cards and two crap cards might get flipped. Then you're stuck with a warehouse full of spice cubes and only crap cards to buy!

It was beautiful, I had a good time playing it, but I'm not sure it's better or different enough from Splendor to justify buying it. A couple guys I play with have a copy so we'll see if repeated plays change my mind :)

Well it looks nice. But vaguely felt like a cube pushing exercise. Not sure if it is better than Splendour - which it gets compared to. Nice components.
It will have to get played again in order to fully evaluate it.

RATING: 8
Only played once. Has a similar feel to Splendor. You're buying cards to build up an engine which then allows you to buy victory point cards. Pretty quick, but interesting choices at every turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I liked it better than Splendor. Firstly, the theme and artwork appeal more to me. Gamplaywise, I feel the "river" brings a lot to drive your choices without making them too obvious, as you need to account for other players. Also, the resource cards offer endless combinations and variability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My initial impression of the game is very good. And the production and presentation of the game are absolutely stellar. 

I completely understand why people are referring to this as a Splendor killer after a few plays, but I fully expect my rating to change with more plays. The deck building aspect of this game is the part I'm not sure of at the moment - whilst it ends up being the backbone of your strategy, I think I prefer the Splendor type mechanisms, where all players have the same actions throughout the game and the strategy lies in the "cleaner" engine build. 

However, I've still got a first impression of the game and am interested in playing it more. Unsure if it will end up climbing slightly closer to 10 or slightly further away with more plays though.

Splendor had a baby with the semi-deckbuilding action-selection mechanism from Concordia. Here it is.

RATING: 5
The game is quite basic. Its mail problem is the random distribution of the cards between cards which generate resources and cards which allow to convert them. If at the start of the game just one or two player are able to grab additional resource generation cards the other players may lag behind and that's frustrating. This happened in quite a bunch of games so I guess it's an issue which should be addressed.

I've played Century: Spice Road five times over the course of two days with two different groups. That should tell you a lot about my feelings on this game. In some ways this game reminds me a lot of Splendor, but with different mechanics, very rules light but with plenty of strategy. I'm looking forward to my next play of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fast, neat little engine building card game. I can see why people compare it to Splendor, but Splendor is far superior, IMO, if only because in Century your "engine" often ends up being just a loop of 3-4 cards that you exploit over and over again. I much prefer the "tableau" style of Splendor, which doesn't make you take the same scripted actions over again across several turns. I still like the game, though, and think it will serve as a nice end-of-night filler.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Good, simple, lightweight racing engine-building, card driven set collection game with a nice hand-building (Concordia style) and hand-management aspect to it, and a really smooth gameplay.
++ Good replayability from the order the Merchant cards and the Point cards show up as they are all unique, so you must always find a new way to fulfill the Point cards the most efficient way possible.
++ Good components: The cards are large tarot-style card that show the art really well (but their quality are just standard though), the wooden cubes are of a good size to help handling them, the plastic bowl are a nice addition that speed up the setup and the metal coins are good, although not really necessary.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion.
++ There will be two other games release in the next two years, Century: Eastern Wonders and Century: A New World, and these games will be able to be integrated with this first one of the trilogy. I'm eager to see this and what Century will become with these.  
++ Super easy to teach, super fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- A bit more luck driven than I like. For the Merchant cards, the paying a cube per cards you skip mechanism mitigate this luck pretty well, but for the Point cards, when you fulfill one and the next that show up may be perfect for your opponent(s), and this is particularly worst at the end of the game.
-- The back of the Merchant cards are inconsistent color-wise (some are darker purple and some are lighter purple). This is not game-breaking (there is a lot of both) but is sad in a such a otherwise well produced game.
-- Since the ressource tokens are just plain cubes (probably to accommodate the integration with future Century games), people just call the resources by their color instead of their intended type names, so this doesn't help with the thin theme.

I really enjoy this one. It's light and super dry, but I just like the overall feeling of the game, building up a little cube converting engine, trying to get certain mixes of cubes to cash in for points. It's nothing meaty or mind blowing, but there's something satisfying to it.

It really seems to borrow a lot from Sid Sackson's Bazaar, using tiny micro-actions in order to gradually gain and convert a set of resources into a set that matches a goal card.

RATING: 7.5
Not quite a Splendor killer for us; there is a lot of rinse and repeat in the gameplay once your 'engine' is established.  The tension comes in once an opponent(s) realizes their engine is sub-optimal compared to yours and has to adjust.

RATING: 7
Splendor-like engine builder that offers enough interesting decisions for gamers while being simple enough for non-gamers to quickly grasp the concept of the game. The artwork is colorful and the components (metal coins! plastic bowls!) are excellent for a game at this price point. Definitely a fun and tight race game that anyone can enjoy.

This is supposed to be a "Splendor killer" according to Tom Vasel. I was waiting to hear about it at Essen, but it was delayed.

Looks like it's Splendor + Concordia (sort of a card-driven Splendor).

Pre-ordered April 2017. Arrived 2017-05-31.

After one play, I can see how it's a Splendor-killer. No idea on the strategies so far - Splendor was far simpler to wrap my head around.

I ended up with a handful of cards, and had problems deciding what to do. Maybe that wasn't the best play on my part. It might have been better to streamline an engine instead of just taking free cards (and wasting turns) to avoid paying spices to get cards further down the row.

Further play might show better strategies - I'm not going to look at the forums in the meantime.

----

After more plays this past weekend, I think I "get" the game more now. I've played games when I've only had a few cards, and been able to win. I like that the play seems to go around the table faster than Splendor. I still have no idea what I'm doing.

Engine building card game that feels similar to Splendor. I like the deck building aspect of it, but there really isn't much to it. The decision making felt repetitive and simple. Overall, it's a good light game. I like splendor more, but don't mind this for a change.

The rules are super simple and are a breeze to teach. It has that Splendor feel of you take one simple action on your turn (take a card from the market into your hand, play a card from your hand, fulfill a victory card, or pick up all your played cards) and the game just flows right along. You do this until someone claims their 5th victory point card and you count points to determine the winner. The deck building can be tricky since the cards are mostly trading cubes instead of production so you have to build a good trade strategy in addition to trying to claim the few production cubes to also generate cubes beyond the two starting yellow. The only fiddly thing I'd say is you are constantly sliding cards on the table to refill the market or victory card rows. It may not have much theme, but the art is fantastic and I can see it being a great opener or closer for an evening.

Played the early version of this and I must say, this is a fantastic game.  The card drafting/deckbuilding mecanic is neat and the set collection is better than a lot of its predecessors.  You don't just pick what you need, you craft it, out of what you previously picked.  Important decisions will be made and have an impact through all of your game but never in a punishing way, always rewarding.  This game will kill Splendor for my family, it has depth while it is easy to learn.  Truly an upcoming gem, I recommend this one for everyone and can't wait to get the final copy.

RATING: 6
Spice Road is a super stripped down cube alchemy game that takes most of what people enjoy about games like Caylus and turns into more of a super filler type game. 
In essence there are 4 types of cubes. Players have a personal deck of cards that can make the first cube type, and to do small upgrades. During their turn they can either play a card (to gain or alchemize cubes), acquire a new action card (which create better cubes outright or allow you to transmute lower grade cubes into better ones at a better rate than your starting cards), buy a VP card from the top row (a public display that slows churns as cards are purchased), or to pick up the cards you have already used and put them back into your hand to use them again. The game continues until someone has purchased 5 of the VP cards, then tally the scores.

So this is the type of game that can be explained in just a few minutes and which has some variation based on the large deck of action cards that will come out in a random order. The VP deck and the Action deck are all just variations on a theme though, so the game really won't feel all that much different from outing to outing, though it will play out differently in particular terms (if that makes much sense). In essence, Spice Road does not strike me as the type of game that will really change all that much from outing to outing, but I do like efficiency games enough to give this one a mild nod for the time being.

I think a couple folks made a bet to see whether they could make a successful game that is pure cube conversion. I'm not sure I would have ended up on the winning side of that bet. Clearly strong evidence that components matter. Although I don't even use the fancy cups that came with the game, as a nice set of silicone baking cups (cheap on Amazon) is a standard accessory I keep  at the ready for games like Le Havre, and this game. Did I mention the game is nothing but cube conversion?

Plays very smoothly; reminiscent of Splendor in that regard. But instead of your engine being "discounts", it's "conversions", and that - plus the decision-points of when to spend tempo on engine expansion / refresh (reclaiming) vs. conversion - make it more appealing to me than Splendor. (Plus, the card rows seem to be a little less volatile, allowing for slightly better medium-term planning.)

Remember: playing a conversion card lets you run that conversion [i]multiple times[/i]. This is presumably why the smaller conversions tend to be worse in terms of upgrades netted - unlike huge conversions, you can actually plausibly use them 2-3x in a single action.

Collecting cubes and converting them to other cubes in order to spend them on something can be a reasonable way to represent something in the right game. When it is the whole game it very quickly becomes tedious.

RATING: 6
Definitely something interesting going on here, but also some potential cause for concern.

First, the good.  The game plays very fast, getting a 2p game done in 20 minutes.  Makes for a good best-two-of-three scenario.  I was also especially impressed by the coins over the contracts mechanism.  Initially I couldn't see why this was there, but it leads to some really interesting timing decisions.  Do I want to complete a contract, but shift my opponent's targeted contract closer to the gold coin?  Well, what if she forces me to?  You have quite a lot of control over the game by the choice of your actions, though this is still quite limited.  Similar to the back-and-forth of Jaipur.

However, the potential worry.  This game is basically *just* the mechanism.  Trade cubes for cubes.  I'm always worried about games like this, that may just be "doing stuff for the sake of doing stuff."  In other words, the mechanism works, but may not be interesting enough.

We'll see if the positives outweigh this...

In the meantime, sent to purgatory to see what the trilogy interaction is going to be

This is basically an engine building game where you are trading and getting cards in order to continue to trade in order to buy cards. It is similar feel to Splendor  and there us minimal player interaction. I'll play it but this game is a little boring for me to want to play it.

Dull and dry cube exchanging game. Literally nothing excited me when playing this; maybe artwork was nice but nothing more. Constant "convert red into green and then spend cubes to gain 10 points" gets repetitive very fast. Lack of player interaction does not help. I could play this again if asked but I'll never propose it I guess.

This is everything I wanted to Splendor to be, it's such a fantastic game. In some engine builders it seems like the game stops right when you get your engine built up enough to really do some damage. In this game you actually get to use your engine a good amount throughout the game. Planning ahead on the order to play your cards is key.

The hand management of choosing when to refresh, sort of like Concorida, is a great mechanic.

Managed to get this played at a Saturday meetup group at three players. It does feel very much like Splendor in that you're obtaining resources, converting them and trying to buy victory point cards. The difference is that anything to do with resources needs to be done via cards, which are drafted from a common marketplace. This means you'll have to consider if taking a high power card is worth the extra cost just to grab it sooner. The game still feels like I'm in my own world, only worrying about other players taking cards before I can get them. With three experienced gamers, we were able to finish the game in 30 minutes or so. Nothing here really excited me as something new or an enjoyable game that I really want to play again. I would gladly play at a game day with others if they brought it out but this is a game that had nothing to hook me into it.

Splendor is more of a pure engine builder. With each card you obtain, your engine improves a bit. The engine you build in Century may work well for one set of available cards but not for the next set. I go back and forth on which game I prefer.

I had a lot of expectations for this game based on everything I had seen and read. Happily it has met them so far. Have now played with most player counts (2, 3, 5) and although it is a very different dynamic with 2 than any other, I really enjoy both. It's super quick turns and fun, I even forget it's just a cube game. Would recommend to nearly anyone.

A very good family level game. It moves at a good clip because there is only one thing you can do each turn. There is enough planning to be engaging, but not so much as to encourage analysis paralysis. It’s been described as a Splendor killer, but it isn’t that for us for the simple reason that Splendor never really caught on with my family (although I like it well enough). The different merchant cards add some variability to he kinds of strategies you are able to pursue. This can also affect the game in some negative ways if there aren't any production cards coming out, for example. The theme is a little thin, but I'm very curious to see what the expansions do and where they take the Century series.

RATING: 6
Cards that give you cubes are essential - you can't upgrade or trade cubes you don't have - but there are less of them than the other kinds of cards.

Does that mean you can be hosed from the start, particularly with 3-4p? Does it create a significant first player advantage?

Need to play again, but it seems like there's a problem.

edit: 2nd play, just 2p and the income cards cooperated and came out aplenty. Now I think maybe the cube hand limit might be the problem? Or maybe it isn't... But after two plays, why am I wondering what the problem is, or if there is in fact a problem at all, instead of enjoying the game? The math may add up to accurate game design but for some reason it doesn't particularly add up to fun.

A light hand-building card game where you gain cards to gain resources to gain VP cards. Goodish starter or finisher to the evening. I might enjoy it with fewer players (I tried it with 5) where it might be easier to plan and take account of what others are up to. But not bad.

Extremely solid game that gets compared to Splendor a lot. In my opinion it's much better than Splendor, on all all counts. It plays excellently with two. Turns are instantaneous. Theming is extremely bland though the game looks good. What's this about remaking the same game every year with a different theme all about? 

Overall it's great, I imagine you could get sick of it, however you'd have played more than your money's worth by that time. There are some interesting decision arcs with regards to building and engine and running an engine. Some cards are just plain better than others. My girlfriend who calls it 'cubes' requested to play it, which is rare. 

Recommended.

Addendum: Ultimately the game isn't that exciting, traded.

Here's how this game was designed:  Take Bazaar and put the equations on cards.   Buy the cards Small World style.  Done.

Literally the most derivative design that I've ever seen.   Nice production.   Is it fun?  Yeah, it kind of is!   But you probably have to like Bazaar or Splendor style engine builders to get a lot out of this.   Otherwise, a couple of plays will show you all it has to offer.

I give  abad rating to this game, mainly for two reasons.
- Too many data to keep under control.
- Mechanism is farr too complicated and it get blocked if the draft give too many transofrmations card instead of production card.

It's like a mix of Splendor and Concordia/Dominion, only worse than all of them.  The idea of a more deck-buildy combo-centric version of Splendor is nice, but the cards themselves have no hierarchy, so it's difficult to actually get an efficient combo since they all interact randomly and there's no promise of better cards as the game goes on.  Card acquisition stalls after everyone has 5-6 of them, so the card market stagnates quickly.  One of the better things about Splendor is that every action you make affects the shared board in some way.  In this game, players will take several turns in a row just exchanging their own cubes, an action that has no effect on the other players other than hinting at which point-scoring card they hope to claim.

* Gateway game to At the Gates of the Loyang

Ascension, Legendary, etc. could take some notes from this.  The satisfaction of deck/hand building and combo making without the frustration of the draw and shuffle.  It has a really smooth feel to it.  I like!

On the downside, there sometimes comes a point where I just find myself staring at all the conversions and quickly losing interest.  The bones of the game become apparent and I find myself wondering why I'm coverting bowls of cubes for cards.  It's a Concordia moment all over again.  I think a different production could have alleviated this for me, but at the end of the day, the cubes never elevate themselves to spices, and the cards never become anything more than cube converters.

I really like the gameplay, but even though the art is good, I don't like the production.

Very tactical, but more strategy than Carcasonne.  Evocative spice pots and trading aspects, but it's almost a race game, racing the caravans to the destinations. I'd like to see the gorgeous art include the 'Stans (Tashkent, Bokhara, Samarkand), India and Persia next. It is indeed exchanging cubes around to get other coloured cubes to then exchange for points, but it does work and I like the deck building customization.

This reminded me of Bazaar, though each player can manipulate their own equations to produce equivalences between certain spices
in an effort to fulfill the requirements of, and hence obtain, the most valuable target cards.
Some cards allow direct draw of multiple or upgraded cubes whereas others require several steps to obtain the upgrades cubes.  There are relatively few of the former which meant there is at least some luck-of-the-draw influence affecting the balance for players.

Century: Spice Road is the first in a series of games that explores the history of each century with spice-trading as the theme for the first installment. In Century: Spice Road, players are caravan leaders who travel the famed silk road to deliver spices to the far reaches of the continent for fame and glory. Each turn, players perform one of four actions:

- Establish a trade route (by taking a market card)
- Make a trade or harvest spices (by playing a card from hand)
- Fulfill a demand (by meeting a victory point card's requirements and claiming it)
- Rest (by taking back into your hand all of the cards you've played)

The last round is triggered once a player has claimed their fifth victory point card, then whoever has the most victory points wins.

Personal note: This game is very similar to Splendor but with instead of obtaining jewels, you are obtaining and trading spices. It plays about the same as well although it is a little bit more involved. Incredible game and very easy to learn.

I found Century: Spice Road even more flat/dull than Splendor, despite the addition of Concordia-like deck building. Admittedly I did not properly understand the valuation of resources (a simple 1, 2, 3, 4 for yellow, red, green, and brown, respectively) until after I'd picked up a few cards in my first game (and therefore had suboptimal combos), but I can't see myself enjoying Spice Road very much even on my next play even with the valuations in place. The strategic basis is too obvious and the rest of the play is mechanical with the slightest of tactical decisions.

[b]Rating based on - 6 plays, 2 player[/b]
A resource conversion game where you get stuff (goods) and cards (merchants) to help you to turn it into other stuff to qualify for contracts which will earn you the majority of your points by game end. Additional points can be gained from gold and silver coins as well as non-yellow cubes in your caravan. Once the 6th contract is fulfilled in a 2 player game, the round is completed and points are tallied.

It's a nice enough theme (if a bit dull and uninspired) which fits with the trading and upgrading actions, but by the middle of your first game you've forgotten that you're trading in spices and there is no talk of turmeric and cinnamon, but of changing yellow cubes into red cubes and doing a two step upgrade from red to brown. Gameplay is not very exciting. Supposedly there should be a race to fulfill contracts, and to get to those gold and silver coins. In our games it was pretty obvious which contract somebody was going for and as soon as you saw you were out of the running you focused on the next best thing.  Also, the winner was always the person who took the highest point contracts available and won the game by quite a large margin from the person who focused on coin collection so after our first few games we tended to ignore the coins. If there was a high value card there then sure we'd take it but otherwise, nope. Our scores were much closer as a result. I'm not sure if 2 player is the best count for this game though because in addition to the dull gameplay the market tended to go stale after a while. Even if it was more inefficient to do something you'd rather do that than make a more valuable or interesting option open to your opponent. While I could play it again, it was just a very average experience for me. However, my gaming partner kind of liked it so I might try to get my hands on the Golem Edition in the future to see if that inspires me more.

This game is all about building an engine that can be ran in many different ways to convert various cubes into other cubes.  Folks seem to want to call this one strategic, but it falls far more into the tactical realm in my opinion.  Depending on turn order and current state can you convert the cubes you have in waiting into the combination required to purchase a useful point card.

The values all seem formulaic.  I recall seeing a post about the math behind the cards.  It feels like a game you could easily just write an AI for, which takes a fairly soulless decision and makes even more drab/uninteresting.

Two plays and then out of the collection.

Hey kids, would you like to try some math??

Games like this remind me that designers usually do a good job of hiding their formulas and strategy balances. Century: Spice Road does the opposite. It jumps out and punches you in the face with its abstract pasted of theme of a math exercise. The value of each victory point card has been precisely and transparently balanced; you know immediately that a yellow cube is worth 1VP, while a red cube is worth 2, and so on.

This hit-you-in-the-face mathematics only makes my issues worth the game even more obvious. Certain upgrade cards are strictly better than others (they have the same payment and effect except one card is 1 yellow less). The designers clearly thought "well, it's a sliding auction, so the players will self-balance it! It doesn't matter!" Ugh. Decide whether that card is worth one or the other -- DO NOT PRINT BOTH.

Also, I am a fan of euros. I like abstract games; Hansa Teutonica is my favorte game and I can't even remember if the cubes are supposed to be soldiers or traders. This game is *too themeless*. Nothing about the design or play makes you connect it to the theme. For a game about spices, this game lacks flavor.

Trade cubes for different colour cubes to allow you to claim points, unfortunately there simply are not enough cards that let you GET cubes to begin with.

Most point cards require 4-6 cubes to claim. You start with 4 and have a card that lets you claim 2 of the most basic. There are plenty of cards that let you manipulate the colours of the cubes but simply gaining cubes is an uphill struggle, especially once you claim the first point card and are back down to only 1-2 cubes to work with. Most of the manipulation cards cost you more resources than they give you  i.e 3 red turns to a single brown.

Unfortunately this results in almost half of the game play being simply passing your turn so you get to pick up the cards you played and return your get 2 basic cubes card to your hand, to immediately play it next turn.

There is no player interaction and so the whole game feels like colour manipulation for the sake of colour manipulation, and makes game play tedious and repetitive.

A step up from Splendor, & two steps up from the Discovery Toy game of Bazaar, which was a family favorite.  The cards are beautiful.  Con: The 4 spices are represented by small colored cubes, & I am just tired of cubes.  This does not distract from the play, which of course is what I have based my rating upon.
     So irritated with box designers.  The molded insert is perfect as long as you do not sleeve these gorgeous cards. So many of us do now...and then to have to toss a great insert like this...makes me sick. When we moved I had to throw out a garage full of inserts I had tried to save.

Game is fine but after repeated plays you can see that the crucial win condition is which action cards you can acquire in first part of the game. The player who manages to take some cube giving cards has an advantage. Comparing to Splendor the problem is that in Century cards are for one purpose only (engine or points) when in Splendor you always buy card for an engine and scoring both which makes decisions much more interesting.

Az engine building része szerintem nagyon jól sikerült, de szinte képtelenség kitalálni, hogy ki melyik lapra megy, így nagyon nehéz előre gondolkodni. Inkább csak gyűjtöd, amit tudsz, és lecsapsz az adódó alkalomra.
Az ára viszont sajnos nevetséges. 5-6k lenne a reális. 10-ért már nem szívesen ajánlom senkinek megvásárlásra, mint bevezető játék

Feels very similar to Splendor, but I think I like it better. Which isn't really saying much after one play, since the key question on these types of games is how tight the design feels after 50 plays.

In spite of its obvious similarities with Splendor, Spice Road is its own game (and, in my eyes, better). It's still a very simple, strongly abstracted engine-building cube-pusher, the very essence of the infamous soulless euro, but the deck-building aspects offer a little more flexibility and make the game just a tad more dynamic. The added inflection point of when to stop going for more cards to finetune your engine and start riding it out allows for slightly different approaches.
Spice Road works well, there are no obvious shortcomings in development, but the fact remains that it's not a particularly deep or exciting game, and I fully expect to have played it out after a handful of plays.

Very mechanical game. Sometimes that is not such a bad thing. Its manly just trading these colored cubes, for other colored cubes. Im not sure I would rate this above splendor, but I wouldnt feel the need to own one over the other. This was a great game for 2, I would play with 3 but there is no way I would do more than 3. This was a very quiet thinky experience, im not sure how often I would want to play this, but It was beautiful and simple enough for a quick play.

RATING: 5
Interesting at first, fluid and pleasant to play. But quickly becomes banal. I trade cubes for cubes to buy cards. After a dozen games, I did not want to play it anymore. I'm not very fond of illustrations. A game to know but a game much less addictive and profound than many of his consorts in the same range.

I really love this game. I'm not good at it - but it just hits the right spot for me in terms of depth vs. time. I could play it multiple times in a night. For me, it's better than Splendor - though I only see some similarities between the two games. I don't see it as a Splendor killer as some propose, however.

I see many others are calling this Splendor killer, however after one play, I still prefer Splendor. Mostly because the long-term strategy  in Splendor is more favorable than this.
And the same problem as Splendor, the theme is nothing, even though the art is polished.
After all, it is another great simple economic engine game. But Splendor is still the champion.

I really like this as a quick 2-3p game, but over that and the game seems to drag.  There is a fair amount of tension generated as you try to push your engine faster than your opponents', but it doesn't quite pack the punch for which I had hoped. 

Still, I play a lot of 2p games, and this is fun enough to hold its spot on my shelves for now. I am very interested to see what the expansions offer, but if it is more of the same, then I will likely trade this away.

Very much an efficiency game. Right from the start, you're converting actions to points in a linear way. I played this with 5p, and it's clear that this has a potential for quite an unbalanced start, as there are very few cards worth 4 actions, but you can luck into one immediately (maybe 1 in 5, or 1 in 10 games). It's kind of the worst of all worlds --one player can start with a very powerful action converter, in a game about converting actions to points. If I were more interested in the game, I'd house rule a starting set of cards to prevent this. There's also a small chance that the card row will log-jam with weak cards that no one wants, locking in lucky early drafts as there's no built-in mechanic to break up a bad card row. That said, there is some tension in the early game to draft an efficient, yet flexible conversion machine (there are 4 different cubes that could be part of a set of 4 or more cubes on a VP card). The need for flexibility is probably what makes the game, as there is a 3 point bonus attached to one of the five cards available for purchase, and racing to these bonuses is perhaps the driving force in the game. I'm not convinced there's much replay though, as the tension decreases during the game, due to the fact that the incentive to draft cards goes down fairly quickly, and you can see who's on track to get what card. This certainly fits the soulless Euro category in terms of theme. On the plus side, this game has an elegant, easily taught core mechanic, is relatively short in duration, and has some tension throughout. 

I wouldn't be surprised if I play it again at some point. It will be interesting to see if I find depth with more plays, or this has already reached its peak and doesn't have more meat to it. 

Other random thought;
The price point on this game slightly annoys me. It's basically a card game with fewer cards than 6nimit (two decks). The cards are lower quality, and over-sized, meaning you may feel the need to sleeve them. A few tokens for bonus points were added, plus a relatively small number of cubes for tracking spices, and the price is $40. More power to the publisher for getting the most $ for the design, but it feels like an over-produced filler.

Once we realised that the trade cards could be played multiple times in a turn, making everything in the trade row valuable and creating the challenge of maximising the value of those cards by setting up combos, the game opened up. The components are lovely (metal coins! colourful cubes!) and we are really enjoying it.

Very similar to Splendor, but I like this game a little bit more. Iike that your engine is cards and you plan order, how you play them, recognizing valuable cards is important in this game. Also this game offers a little bit more planning ahead than in Splendor. Also in my opinion Century Spice Roads has much more theme than Splendor. You are trading spices here and delivering them to clients (point cards).

This really does feel like Splendor in that it's an engine game that happens one micro-step at a time, but it's also very different. I love the hand building here, and putting together an engine loop to exploit is very satisfying. I'm excited to play this one more.

This one is so smooth. I think once new players are up to speed, games should move quickly. I'm excited to reach that point. It's good as a 45m game, it will be excellent as a 30m game.

Fun, breezy engine building/hand management game where you collect and trade goods in order to fulfill contracts and gain victory points. The production values are very good: the art is good, the cards are large and it even comes with metal coins and plastic bowls for the different goods.
From the games we had I got the feeling the luck of the draw can make it very swingy. The players who get a good card early can keep using it for the rest of the match.
The publisher is promising this is the first in a trilogy of games that can be combined to form a larger one. I'm looking forward to it!
I have two things I don't like in the game. First, the same artwork is used for cards that have different effects so it's easy to mistake them at a glance. The second is the coins are never used as coins. The players simply collect them and never get to use them other than to add to their score at the very end. Still, I had fun and would play it again.

Turn cubes into other cubes, into other cubes, into points. Rinse and repeat. Sounds dull, but is actually really engaging. I liken it to Splendor in that players take micro-actions on their turns and do that over and over until the game ends. It feels like you're always making progress and so even if the game ends and you didn't win you feel a sense of accomplishment. My kind of game.

Century: Spice Road is very good at what it tries to be--a simple engine builder to streamiline the resources into contracts mechanic.

I always enjoy plays, but it isn't one that I seek out.

Builds on a similar system of Splendor, though we feel this game has more involvement for the player. The thrill of setting up card combos to maximize resources feels great. The deck building is a great balance of paying for what you need or taking a free card with cubes on it and figuring out a way to maximize it makes for a fun give and take. Thoroughly enjoy the game

What a cool game! To begin with the art work and components are beautiful. Nice wooden cubes representing the spices with plastic bowls to hold them. Metal coins!

Game play is consistent with a lighter game and is therefore easy to teach and play. There is still, however, enough here to form a strategy and have some fun. Great gateway game, family game or filler for seasoned gamers.

I have played this one time, so take my comment lightly.  The game was obvious and most cards are +2 and some cards are +3 or +4.  The game isn't just about the + of the cards, it is also the tempo of getting point bonuses as those can be worth more than the bonus of doing an expensive point card.  I figured this out immediately so this game is not at all re-playable for me.

This game feels a LOT like Splendor. However I actually enjoy it more for the reason of in Splendor, you can just scan the play area (as everything except maybe reserved cards are public) and count how many moves it will take someone to buy those expensive cards, what they are going for, etc etc. 

In this game, you can kind of tell what other players are going for based on what cubes they have, but you can't always tell how CLOSE they are to getting it. Everyone starts with the same two cards in their hand/deck, but will acquire more cards from the display, and all cards have different exchanges... so you aren't going to remember what cards everyone has acquired over the course of the game (at least I'm not haha). The cards do things like get cubes, trade cube(s) for better cube(s), or trade a good cube for a lot of cheaper cubes. In most cases, the colors are specified.

The blocking element isn't as strong here (you can hoard gems in Splendor), but it isn't something I really miss.

Gameplay is polished "find the most efficient engine". Nice artwork and components. Better theme integration than splendor, though still bolted on. In 2 player the game gets dull midway - the engine is built and drawing cards is less useful than trading, so you get no sense of accomplishment/progression as its mostly turning the handle from there. Player competition is minimal - you know who can win a points card far in advance and you've probably each specialised in different colours due to that.

Comparison inevitable. Century has the fun built into its first half, whereas Splendor is slow to start but fun once the engine has been setup, because the number of gems you get becomes more ridiculous and you feel successful. (In century your point cards are held face down so cant even see the nice artwork you've won.)

Similar rating as Splendor, but doesn't offer a better experience. Still prefer Jaipur for 2 player trading themed game.

I've never played Sackson's Bazaar so can't compare but this does feel very similar to Splendor in that the incremental resource trading engine gets better allowing you to make better and more efficient trades for more valuable spices. I like it but it doesn't give that satisfaction of achieving something as Splendor does.

Nice artwork on the cards though. The coins are definitely unnecessary since you don't actually use them to buy or trade for things.

This has been described as a splendor killer, and I just don't see it. It's vaguely similar, and for me not as good, but I think they both stand on their own as games. I like how splendor has a bit of an arc, whereas in this you're getting the same set of points cards the whole time. At least in my game, there was a weird pace, where we all took cube generating cards for a while and then started getting cubes and point cards and largely ignored the cube generators. There seems to be a nice level of planning and chaining together the various conversions that you have access to from the cards, and so therefore getting a good set of cards that works well together is very important. One concern is that some people might see cards that combo better with the ones they've already taken than other players. Though that's just speculative. I ran away with the one game I played and I don't feel like I played particularly well, which is usually a good way to make me think the game is a bit too arbitrary. I was usually planning a few turns ahead in my conversions, but I think it's possible that the only reason I was able to was because of the fact that my cards all went together so well. So even if I did just take cards better than everyone else, that still means I was on autopilot after a certain point.

After numerous plays, I believe this game has tremendous staying power.  It's fast, has a simple rule set, great visual appeal and enough bite to keep lighter and medium weight gamers engaged.  This was my favorite game at Origins 2017 and I even bought the playmat (and I NEVER buy playmats).  I originally thought this would be a Splendor killer but I don't think it scratches the same itch for me.  I love both games equally and will not be getting rid of either any time soon.

Century: Spice Road is apparently the first in a line of historically themed euros called "Century: (Fill in Historical Reference Here)". Funny thing is that there is nothing about the game itself that feels in any way historical. This is a dry resource conversion exercise, very similar to Splendor. On a turn you can play resource cards from your hand to gain or create conversions between four resource types. You can also buy a point card if you have the resources to do so, or pick up played cards back into your hand. Repeat these steps until one player has gained 5 point cards and the game ends. If you like Splendor, I can't imagine for the life of me why you wouldn't like this as well and the opposite is true if you hate Splendor. You might prefer one over the other, though. Splendor is a steady progression of building a basis of gems with collected cards while Century: Spice Road is about drafting more conversion options and flexibility. For all that, I like them both about the same. I have Splendor, not sure I need this one as well.

After one 4p game, I can't say that Spice Road lived up to the hype for me. On the plus side, it looks really cool and the components are pleasingly sturdy. It also plays quite quickly- I was surprised by how little downtime there was between my turns. That said, it didn't really amount to much more than converting colored cubes to cubes of other colors repeatedly. Meh.

Better than Splendor? Yes.

Even though, in comparison to Splendor, this is more AP prone (meaning people will sometimes stall on their turns), and also harder to teach... it is more rewarding, more fun, and a bit more strategic. I think it is similar enough to Splendor you aren't likely to play both... so buy this one instead (unless you have a problem like me and just buy everything).

Rather than mentioning with positives (because, well just about everything)... I'll mention the negatives:
1) AP inducing. I will generally play my turn in 1-10 seconds, averaging about 3 seconds in a 2-4 player game. This is fast, often made faster by the fact that at least one opponent will take 10-60 seconds averaging maybe 20-30 seconds per turn. That is bad, so bad half the table will be moaning every turn. This issue made me hesitate to put it at 9, especially because experience doesn't fix it. But it's also an issue with so many games I feel like I'd be docking points for anything 'mathy' (which this most definitely is). 
2) Could use an expansion. Well, surprise... they are planning several even before release (see box). I think this game would have benefited from a couple of optional modules being included in the base game. It is awesome as is, and I won't dock it, but personally I feel like it should have been $5 extra and include some extra modules (For example maybe 16 different 'start' cards where each player randomly gets one to start with in addition to the base 2).

I suspect that a two player game is going to be a completely different experience than 3-4.  The trick in this game might be to not over-build your engine.  The playing time is relatively short and putting too much time into the engine might put you enough behind in number of point cards that you won't have time to make a run for it at the end.

Century: Spice Road is an engine builder that is built around hand building mechanism similar to Concordia. Unfortunately you just don't have much control over what your engine will be producing because the merchant card drafting is very tactical. You will pick up what's available and hope your engine will turn out stronger than others'. Besides that the reality of the game is very much a dull 1. produce cubes 2. trade them for nicer cubes 3. trade cubes for points process. This process is also very much a solitaire, apart from picking up point cards. The game has drawn comparison to Splendor, but loses to it in many ways. The resource management is less tight, there is less tension because of the Solitaire-ish nature, it feels much more repetitive due to lack of tension, the randomness of how your engine will be and components. The art is neat, but very generic, card quality is lacking, the spice cups are very prone to falling over and the custom designed insert doesn't have enough room for all the cards. The game works better with two than four players due to it being less of card lottery.

RATING: 7.5
This might be the purest representation of the "cube pusher". I love the card acquisition mechanism, and the hand management, but mainly, I love how your engine has to stay flexible to adapt to the VP-card row. It also plays at such a frenetic pace that you can't get bored.

Often called the "Splendor killer". In that light it does offer light yet rewarding gameplay, a risk with tempo versus combo building and lovely tactile gameplay. Though the cubes/spices are definitely not as inherently fun as the Splendor chips.

Spice Road is a fun, light-to-medium resource management game that 's easy to get into make some amazing plays with.

Played it with three and four and prefered 3p version. Simply easier to react properly and a bit less luck of the draw.

This has the feel of Splendor but with more choice, more options and a less punishing end game ( That final rush and you know it's coming.
On it's own merits, the art work is fantastic and atmospheric, The components are excellent for a game at this price point, the Big Cards are a real boon and the coins are just icing on a beautiful cake. 
Game play wise, four different coloured "spices/cubes" are traded and exchanged to get better and better combinations to buy locations that are laid out for all to see. Who will get that beautiful location worth 20 first? but wait other people have got some lesser locations and now, because of the 20's position it is worth an extra 3 points due to the first 2 locations on the "market "having a bonus coin tied to it to entice you! 
A brilliant game thats going to get a awful lot of play!

Egyrészt fantasztikus kivitelezés, minőségi kártyák, grafika, fémpénzek, műanyag tálkák, stb, másrészt viszont kicsit feleslegesen agyontupírozott. Értem én, hogy manapság ez a kivitelezési szint a mérvadó, csak az árat tekintve általában fájdalmas érzés mégis. No, de maga a játék imádnivalóan egyszerű, remek, jól átlátható a szabályrendszere, szuper szórakozás. Viszont azért ez összességében a lehető legtisztább kockamenedzselés, egyik színből a másikat gyártjuk, majd azokat győzelmi pontokra váltjuk. Nincs semmi, ami enyhítené ezt a szárazságot. Nekem ez nem probléma, főleg, hogy egy fél órás mókáról beszélünk, de azért megértem, ha valakinek fájdalmas ez a "sárgából zöld, amiből barna lesz" koncepció.

I have mixed feelings about this one. Played it dozens of times and so far I wouldn't call it a smart game. The goal of this cube-and-card-game-mix is to trade different supplies (spieces, that everyone calls just yellow, green, red and brown) to score points by fulfilling trading contracts. It is kind of a race, where false decission during your turn may cost you victory. So, just pass me a few yellows and go on. I hope the new game expected to come up in mid 2018 would add some depth in player interaction, cuz now it is the weakest feature of Century.

This is not the splendor killer.
Infact the added choice. taking cards back in your hands.. feels like passing. 
The resourse conversion is stripped down to basics so that you start counting 1,2,3 benefit.
The only thing that really works is the cube limit of ten.
There is also no growth like in splendor .. in splendor you get extra points from nobles and your engine gets automatically bigger.
In this your engine can be four cards you picked up at the start that work well together with no need to,make it any bigger.. 
I probably give it a few more,shots.. easy to explain and there are some decisions .. but this straight up resource conversion doesnt do it for me.

The worst thing probably about the design is that there are weaker action cards added to the deck to limit the good cards. this is supposedly done to offer more strategy . So,you would be forced to pay for good ones... Amd that is another problem with it.. it is forced.
Advanced players certainly have an edge over newer players.. they will easily get a good engine. but this will show how many bad cards there really are...

Splendor has a similar thing going on with the first and second row.. And it pays off if you can switch pretty quick to the second row and pay some more instead of taking free stuff.
While in splendor the scoring is obvious and easier picked up by newer players the advantage of paying for these better action cards (that are in the same row and can be cheaper than bad cards)  is a postponed pointscorer (giving you better trade results)
What i am trying to,say is that splendor's learning curve is not as big. It is pretty obvious what the experienced plauer is doing and it is easier to copy that.

In century this is less obvious for,casual gamers to pick up.and trading cubes for other colour cubes is less exciting to them than seeing their engine and playing with poker chips.

Nice big cards with great artwork. Cool the they include small plastic bowls with the game. Very thematic touch, even though the spices are represented by cubes. Interesting mechanic where there is a race to obtain score cards with money attached to them. Helps to move along the order fulfillment cards quickly. Low player interaction, which isn't as much fun in my book. Even though I have all of these positive things to say about the game overall, I still like Splendor better for some reason.

How does one approach the "Splendor killer" if one wouldn't mourn too much if Splendor were indeed killed? That's the question here. I don't hate Splendor, but I've never gotten the joy out of it that others seem to have. I've found it a little dull, a little ugly, and a lot not particularly interesting. Telling me a game "fires" it is like suggesting that what I'm about to eat will make me never want to dive into a bowl of bran flakes ever again.

Century: Spice Road is apparently part of some kind of larger project that I absolutely do not understand even after reading what that project supposedly is. It's also been described by its designer as another soulless cube pusher and well, he's not wrong.

CSR is a bland, mechanical game. It does what it does well enough, I guess, but it seems to mainly exist for folks who have some kind of court-ordered mandate to play games and need something that fulfills the legal definition sufficiently. I generally like theme in my games, a sense of who I am and what I'm doing and why and this game wasn't built for that. Which is fine; it clearly pleases others.

For me, CSR is absolutely there with Splendor. It's a game. If I play it, there's an entry on BGG for me to log. It looks a bit nicer than Splendor. Neither one of them interests me much.

While a lot of people have said this game replaces Splendor, I have to disagree with them.  It is a very similar game, no doubt about that at all.  However, I think there are enough differences between the two to warrant playing/owning both of them.  While I thoroughly enjoyed Century: Spice Road, I tend to lean a bit more toward Splendor just for personal preference.  I think the row of purple cards you pursue in Spice Road becomes a moot point after a while (they generate or allow you to exchange spice for other spice).  Players get the few they want and then it's time to start generating spice.  The focus ends up elsewhere and you have this major aspect that is no longer a big factor.  Sure, the cards claimed from there are, but that row itself became stale after we all got the 2 to 4 cards we wanted.  

As for other aspects of the game, the card art is simply beautiful, the little bowls that come with the came to hold the cubes is an appreciated touch and the metal coins are certainly a welcomed addition.  There is a great production value here and great replay value.  Again, if you already have Splendor, you should definitely still check out Century: Spice Road.

첫번째 게임 후 리뷰:
현재 상황에서 최적 행동을 선정하는 게임으로 듣던대로 인터액션이 발생하지 않고 순전히 자신 것만 고려해 최고 점수를 얻는 게임으로, 자기만족의 욕구가 없으면 재미가 떨어질 것 닽다. 나쁘진 않지만 자주하기 애매하다.

다인플을 해보니 순신간에 흘러가는 상황에서 이기기 위한 턴계산이 중요해 보인다. 카드 운도 좀 영향을 주고 있지만 게임은 괜찮다.

Beren had gotten Century Spice Road at Origins, so we decided to try some of the new hotness. It was ok. It felt VERY Splendor-eque in that it was a cool puzzle to try and optimize, but it had a LOT of obvious choices. There wasn't really that much for me to decide to do. I would maybe play it again, but I certainly wouldn't buy it.

Get the card that gives you a brown cube and always try to complete either the gold objective or the next one in line if someone else will get there before you.

Abstract resource conversion game that provides GREAT fun if you like to have your brain burned quite a bit. Despite its almost total lack of theme, this card game makes you feel totally immersed in it and concentrate from the beginning to the end. 
Good indirect interaction makes it great at high player count but you'll have to hurry before the objective cards you're looking at will get reached by the others. A bit more strategic with 2 but at that count the market feels way less dynamic. 
I have some doubts about the replayability since the game is repetitive indeed, but after few games I can say it's just fun.

If you've played Splendor or anything like Splendor and enjoyed it, I think you would have fun with Century: Spice Road.  It's very similar, essentially you are trading one resource for another, in this case spices.  The cards in your hand will allow you to either take new spices or trade in lower value spices for higher value spices.  Once you have enough spices to "buy" a market place you can do so.

The game ends once someone has purchased 5 market cards, but that doesn't mean they win, each market card has a point value and the player with the highest point value wins.

I've only played this game 2 player and it works well as a 2 player game.

Really wanted to love this.  I love engine building games and how you manage your cards, but this is fairly dull to play - lacks excitement until the last part of the game.

I'll still watch for the sequels - maybe they'll be a little more exciting to play.

I have not played this myself, but watched the review by Martin Klein, about this game having been done better before. This is hand building, in which you try to build a combo to get and transform spices into each other and finally into points. Once you have the combo, you perform it over and over again, without any meaningful player interaction. Hmm, does not sound interesting.

(11/17) 7. A solid game in the "Splendor" style with a handful of resources that can be upgraded and turned in for cards.  I don't think it's quite a Splendor killer, but I think I'd prefer to play it over Splendor, at least for now.  The Golem edition is probably my preferred one, though I don't understand the need for two editions with completely different art styles.

RATING: 6
I don't see the appeal of this game.  This as euro as a board game can get.

In short, you have objective cards to fulfill by getting different colored cubes.  How do you get these cubes?  You buy cards that are either variations of "upgrading" cubes, gaining cubes, and exchanging one colored cubes for other colored cubes.

That's the entire game.  It's a simplistic bare bones engine builder with no theme and very little interesting decisions to make.  Much like Splendor, they are far more interesting games to waste 30 to 45 minutes on (e.g. Evolution: Climate and Libertalia)

Sublime. Perfect. Awesome. We play with the whole family, wide range of ages 8-55 and we all LOVE IT. The sense of accomplishment by building your own engine is exquisite, even if you don't end up winning the game. Turns go fast and it is amazing to me that a game with no theme can be this engaging. Production is crazy good. I will only point out that at least in my copy, and depending on the room lights, the coins color is ambiguous. I did paint in base yellow and silver and give them a dark wash.

You’ve probably heard this be compared to Splendor, and it’s fair. Like Splendor, you’re trying to build a tiered engine by turning in a small resource for a larger one, and so on until you get victory points. 
I think it might have a little more dimension to it than Splendor, however, as you are exchanging x number of cubes for y number of more favorable cubes. Building out this part of your engine is really the gist of the game, in my opinion. Acquiring the right cards to turn three yellow cubes and a red cube into six yellow cubes, a green, and a brown. Or something like that. 
The praise for this one is valid. Worth the bucks, even if you have Splendor.

I'm revising my opinion about it being better than Splendor - there's a bit too much luck variance based on cards that come out, and at some point in the game, production cards stop being cycled enough when players have built a solid production engine.

Plays nice and smooth with two players.  I would have given it an 8 or 9 after my first game.  Then, in the second game, the triple upgrade came out early and my opponent was able to hammer it unimaginatively without buying many other cards, cruising to a 15 point win.  Depending on if there are ways to slow down the player with that card, my rating may go up or down.  Either way, this isn't quite a Splendor killer.

Gets compared to Splendor but aside from them both having point tiles/cards that your trying to attain they both play quite different with this one being by far the more interesting of the two. 
In Splendor you just take the colours you need but in this one you must first deck build ala Concordia to then be able to convert cubes to get the colours you need, there's a Small World style card grab where they all slide down and you pay more for a further away card, with any luck you'll build an efficient card playing cube converting engine to get the point cards to win! Very thinky for such a simple to learn game.

RATING: 5
Not bad, but again, another euro with no tie-in between game mechanics and theme.

Not quite a replacement for Splendor, Spice Road plays differently enough and is more complex than Splendor.

Very nice production values:  large sized cards, large wooden cubes, bowls for the cubes and 20 metal coins!

Straightforward rules:  1st player to buy 5 Caravan cards triggers the end of the game with players in a round completing their turn.  VPs = Caravan value, Coins, and 1 vp per non-yellow cube.

During a player's turn, take 1 of the following 4 actions:

1)  Buy a Caravan card with your cubes (players can store a max of 10 cubes between turns).
2)  Pickup a Merchant card, dropping cubes along the way to pickup the card leftmost to the card you want to pickup.
3)  Play a card from your hand.  The Merchant cards are the cube engine of the game and allow conversion of cubes to other cubes or "upgrading" existing cubes to a more valuable cube (4 types of cubes).
4)  "Rest" and draw all played cards to your hand.

That's it essentially.  Caravan cards are worth a fixed number of vps and have a cube cost needed to obtain them.  The 2 left Caravan cards will give the player either a gold (3vps) or silver (1vps) if purchased, up until the coins run out.

Players strive to build the most efficient cube engine out of their Merchant cards and to be most efficient with their actions.

Game is quick to play, easy to teach and looks good.  There is more going on than Splendor, and building a cube engine in Spice Road is a bit more interesting.  A good gateway game with nice components.  If you like Splendor, I'd recommend at least trying Century:  Spice Road.

A decent game but not the splendor killer it is being sold for - it has some similarities but different enough to have both. It plays very fast, which is really a high pro - con is that after a while, the lower row of cards won't change anymore as people have build up their decks and don't want to invest in cards anymore.

Slow-paced deckbuilder / cube-conversion engine. Has one major design flaw, which is that the card market is never refreshed unless someone takes a card--thus you can end up in situations where no one wants to take cards because none of them are relevant to the currently available points cards, and so it just stagnates (since the incentive mechanism--the usual "add a cube to passed-over cards" a la Small World--only triggers WHEN people take cards).

tl;dr: I was bored.

"My-first-engine-builder" the game. Straightforward micro turn structure allows anyone to play, and the random contracts keep any one card from being more than contextually good, but it is easy to feel oneself fall behind once an opponent gets an extra contract or two that happened to match their conversion cards better than the offerings on display do yours.

Nice filler type game.  Nothing I care to own, since I'm happy with Splendor which fills the same niche for me.

Bumping up to an 8.  Played with 5 players and felt it was more tense/interesting/fun than with 3 players.  Still don't see the need for both this and Splendor in my collection. We'll see.  Splendor IMHO is the more elegant game.  No need for cube/resource management.

Not worth playing at 2 players. 3 players was good. My play was very very quiet though. The game was quick and easy to learn. Quick to play. Many times people were waiting for someone to take their turn but it was their turn already and they had no idea.

I need to play this a few more times to figure my opinion out better. I don't think it is trending in a positive direction over all though.

Very good light abstract resource trading game using a card play style similar to Concordia.  I ended up giving my copy to a friend as I plan to pick up the Golem Edition of the game.  That is by far my biggest knock on the game.  They cancelled the Golem edition, so I bought the version I did not really want, then they announced it.

(After 8 Plays) 1/30/18: This game is a blast to play. Everyone I have taught it to has loved it. Its very simple but allows for some strategy. There isn't much interaction in the game which can be good for newer players. My one real negative is the theme. It is basically non existent while also not having the greatest artwork. The art isn't bad so much as it doesn't grab you. Regardless, this is a perfect gateway type game that I see being in rotation for a long while.

Missing something. Very reminiscent of Sackson's Bazaar, Splendor, or Portal of Heroes, but simpler than any of those. The deckbuilding element differentiates the game a little, but seems too luck-driven to really help it to surpass its kin, each of which offers some mild element of strategy or a tougher optimization puzzle.

Seems like a mix of Splendor and maybe something like Dominion, except you can play as many cards as you have/want over the rounds until you run out.  Our first play we got a bad selection of purple cards and I was not happy with the gameplay.  Second time was MUCH better after some thorough shuffling.  Great game.

Century: Spice Road is Splendor, but with Deck-Building. Beyond the increase in complexity that this additional mechanism brings, the card powers are very swingy. These two elements make C:SR less accessible and novice players will likely struggle to compete in the engine building required to compete against experienced players.

As I understand, this is the first of a three-game series that will eventually bleed into each of the other games, like the GIPF series.  When that happens, I'll revisit Spice Road.  Until then, I will not play this game again.  Period.

It does what it does very well.  In short, it takes everything I already don't like about Splendor, hobbles its tactical play through its strategic engine buildout, and hobbles its strategic engine buildout through randomization.  The strategy/tactics dyad is reversed, and as a result Spice Road feels like a goddamned 45-minute exercise in slow abstracted cube optimization, as I upgrade cubes into different colored cubes for a creeping 2-3pt improvement ratio, in order to score point cards that are literally the point values for the cubes.  God help you if you don't get a decent engine going in four or five turns, because you're not getting an opportunity to upgrade it later.  And there's coins that get you more points but they're not worth the effort to gain if your engine isn't already optimized to take advantage of the opportunity... and they're absolutely necessary to win.

So yeah, when new elements get added that impact the game in any novel way whatsoever -- when the game stops being "create an engine quickly and fairly randomly, then grind like it's Disgaea 2" -- I'll revisit.  But in its current incarnation, Spice Road is the polar opposite of fun.  And that's a shame because I usually really enjoy Emerson's designs.  This one didn't just fall flat, I actively hate it.

I don't like that some cards are just better than others. The luck of the setup can lead to a runaway winner. It would be fun to build an engine if you knew what you were trying to accomplish. The best engine in the world is no good if the cards don't match. Also, the theme is so dry it might as well just by called century: math road. This game really makes the players feel like they are solving an algebra problem.

I can see why this gets comparisons to Splendor, but there is more control to the engine-building here and a generally less frustrating experience. But it would be pushing credibility to suggest it was anything more than mediocre.

[b]Century: Spice Road[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Century: Spice Road was okay, but felt very similar to Splendor because in both you are collecting cubes/tokens to fulfill orders. It does have the added decision of having to upgrade cubes, but in all honesty I'm not sure that makes it a better game than Splendor. I think Century: SR could induce severe AP in some folks as they try and plan ahead and decide between which 6 cards to take; you'd almost need a chess timer to play with certain people. I know the game's not completely luck driven, but there are definitely enough cards in the deck that someone can get a pretty great combo early, do to the card draw, and ride it to a lopsided victory. In the end I didn't love it or hate it, and even though I'd play again it's off my wishlist.[/i]

This may be the only game I own where my typical strategy of "just go with the flow, play seems best at this immediate time" will not work lol.

I had to spend time to think about my combos and the turns my opponent had before they could pick up their next points card. It *did* feel quite math-y to me because of this and probably rubbed be wrong at first. I'll have to get this to the table a few more times... I know people are comparing it to Splendor but it's nice to own both because they have the same feel but one is more involved than the other. I can absolutely still see myself playing Splendor as a filler or a coffee-game whereas C:SR would be closer to a main game.

After first play: I like the action cards with resource trading mechanics, but the game really is only that: a resource manipulation mechanics. I really dislike the way you score, I never like scoring in "clumps". Some may think it gives strategic choises, buying cheap scoring cards or expensive high scoring cards, but no. The scoring cards just feels like: "ok, we have a neat mechanics, how do we take a shortcut making it into a game".

Based on one play: You collect cards in order to gather cubs which you upgrade or covert into other color cubes in order to finally trade them in specific sets for point cards. It is fairly basic but I found it did not work as well as other games that have a very similar premise. You action cards that covert cubes force you to wait for specific cube sets to get points since if you have too many cards in hand you are just waiting time, so you try to get ahead or aim for different sets than others. It got dull fairly fast.

Century: Spice Road is a filler-weight hand-building game (like Concordia) with contract fulfillment. During a player's turn, he can either play a card to turn colored cubes into other colored cubes, take a new converter card into his hand, or pick up all previously played cards. There are a number of contracts available that a player can simply turn in the right combination of cubes for. This game is really a bare-bones version of the hand-building mechanic that we've seen in a number of heavier games. It's very simple and quick-playing, but I suspect that the amount of strategy is relatively low.

Hand building game (close to deck building) with a good puzzle and race aspect. Especially getting the right combination of trade cards is challenging and rewarding.

It's a solid game, but a little on the light side for me personally.

Decent resource acquisition game similar to Splendor to obtain combos for future cards.  I liked how one had to build the combos and plan ahead when to get spices, acquire cards, and to rest.  The game played fast and rules were clean.  I liked how it didn't seem automatic with moves.  I liked the player competition for completing the goals/contracts.

The game seemed to be based on the combo setup too much.  Preplanning moves seemed to not alter once selecting that route.

Now that I own it and have played it, I don't understand the comparison to Splendor. it's more like a variation on "Builders: Antiquity". 

Century Spice road can be a bit dependent on the available cards which cycle very slowly at first, then speed up, then stop altogether when players have built enough of a deck to generate spices and start cycling that deck to buy points cards. Buying engine cards and refreshing your hand are essentially wasted turns, so It's important to quickly get a decent number of cards that work together so you can stop buying engine cards and get to the place where you can play your hand in various orders and get the resources you need before having to refresh your hand. Low point cards mean a faster game with smaller hands whereas larger point cards require more complex transformations of spices and larger hands so you're not constantly cycling your hand to get basic resources. It really is a lot like Builders: Antiquity, though with Builders, the hand refresh happens naturally after each purchase and in Century, the hand refresh is deck driven as it is in Concordia. It has a bit of an "engine stalls periodically" problem, in that you might build a hand that allows you to get the available cards, but as those cards get purchased, your trading engine might not get you where you need to be. 

* Three plays in & two of those games were won as a result of one player having built an engine that played better with the randomly drawn cards that came out. So it feels a bit like 10 minutes of building an engine, 10 minutes of using that engine, and then 10 minutes in which the person whose engine works best for cards that they didn't know (couldn't know) were coming slowly wins while the other players scramble to get back in the game. I wouldn't play it again without significant "house rules" to solve that weak point. Perhaps the answer is simply that instead of 5 scoring cards coming out and being replaced by blind draw, maybe 10 cards come out and the rest go back in the box and perhaps there is a cube system to access those higher cards. Like lay the 10 cards out in two rows of five, and a person has to pay in resources to access the second row before it drops down to the accessible row (sort of the reverse of how St. Petersburg lowers the cost of scoring cards before they drop off the bottom of the board) I don't know... but something needs to be done, otherwise it's a game with 10 minutes of "grinding" to build an engine, then 10 minutes of fun, then 10 minutes of the lucky person slowly winning while the other players try to adapt their engine so that it will work for the remaining available scoring cards.

Simple and fast. A very good intro or filler.

It's been compared to Splendor, however aside from the fact that there are public contracts (cards) that all players are vying for, the mechanics are not very similar.

First, the resource pool in Century is not limited. That means that your "plan" on what to do on your next turn can't be altered significantly by what other players do. This keeps the game moving at a brisk pace, sometimes comically fast.

Second, Century has a deck-building and engine building aspect. The spices that you gather, and your ability to upgrade spices, is directly impacted by the cards that you add to you caravan (hand). You thus have control of your own destiny in terms of how you build you spice gathering and trading empire. You have the ability to formulate a strategy and customize your caravan towards the cards that you want, and players may grow differently meaning that they're not necessarily in direct competition.

That makes the game not so much about who can get certain things first, but who can do things the best. That, to me, makes the game less confrontational and more enjoyable.

I'm really struggling to see what all the buzz around this game is for. In fact, I would argue that at lower player counts, it's downright bad, and at higher counts no more than mediocre. With so few cards required to win, the dominant strategy seems to be to hoover up lowish scoring cards that can be got far more easily than high scoring cards because 5 or 6 lowish cards will almost always beat 3 or 4 high ones. And the gameplay is hugely prone to an extremely annoying stasis in the market as well. Some cards that you can buy to go in your hand are clearly vastly better than others so if you get a run of crap cards in the market that don't really improve your deck if you purchase them, either the market locks up or someone tries to get it moving by buying weak cards only to end up basically wasting one (or more) turns and perhaps finally revealing a good card that an opponent can then grab. When early reviewers started to compare this to Splendor, I expected at least a decent game, but in my opinion at least, this isn't fit to clean Splendor's shoes. Oh, and it's egregiously overproduced and thus way too expensive for this type of game. Bad all round.

Accessible and enjoyable light to mid-light game. Collect various cube types to turn in for victory points. The notion of its resemblance to Splendor is only on the surface.
 Both use colored items - one, poker chips as gems, the other cubes as spices, and these items are converted into victory points. That's where the similarity ends. As for play, mechanics, and strategy and tactics, totally different games.

Splendor is a very elegant, tight, streamlined, minimalist, and rather short game. Century is longer, looser , more prone to luck and an occasional small amount of analysis-paralysis. Both are fun to play.
My rating is for up to 4 players. With 5 I'll take off at least one star.

RATING: 6
Based on the market flop and cards you get, the game can zoom for some and be a slog for others. The sliding contracts mechanic is a bit weak and may have been better with different decks for easy and hard contracts. The hand limit chops off the engine building mechanic at the knees as you are forced to flush your reserve for a single contract and build back up (very few ability cards are pure resource granting making the double yellow cube generator your crappy lifeline). One thing I find very frustrating is that there is no concept of reserving a contract (which would make it feel very very similar to splendor) -- however, given that you only have one action - not being able to reserve means you can be building for a while and get completely screwed with no real ability to efficiently recover. It may have been cool if contracts granted some sort of upgrade/favor towards player powers of a given type/color etc. Or had some one time bonus. In the end, I think I was really left craving some chaining-mechanic.

This is a quick playing game where players are trying to complete recipes on a conveyer belt. The longer the recipe card stays on the belt the more it's worth in VP. The game is fueled by card plays like in Concordia including the need to spend a reset action to get your cards back. New cards are purchased from another belt of cards, and to get the more recently flipped cards you have to pay cubes up the track like in Firenze. Then also just like in Firenze, if you buy a card with cubes on it you get those cubes to use. Cards come in three varieties. Get more cubes, upgrade the colors of your cubes, or downgrade cubes of high colors into more cubes of lower colors. The game is fine, but a little dull. It's reasonably good for a filler, and I love both Concordia and Firenze, so I'm glad to see some of their mechanisms in other players, but I wish the card effects were just a little more interesting.

Jesus, Sid Sackson invented Bazaar 50 years ago.  We really don't need this.  And the back story on this game is tragic.  There is literally nothing historical or interesting about trading some cubes for other cubes and then trading those for VP.

YASE.

If everyone's comparing it to Splendor, then I'll do as well.

Better than Splendor as I've burnt out on that one (I reached my limit after three plays).

Century: Spice Road plays much faster than Splendor and it is easier to explain. But I think it's less replayable. There's less interaction than Splendor as it's less open. At least in Splendor you can foresee what your opponent is trying to do and try to do something about it. In Century: Spice Road, your opponent's "cube-exchange" cards stay hidden until played, and I don't think anyone has the patience to remember what everyone drafted.

Still this is a game that my non-gamer friends would love and play over and over again.

This game is a good game, I just don't want to play it. I don't really care for the theme, the art, or the gameplay. It's all kind of that Splendor blah that I don't really care about.

Falls into the category of Splendor: everyone plays for themself and you try to upgrade your spices through your engine. Engine building is kind of the first phase, after that everybody tries to run it to complete the point cards. Kinda abstract, good components, but Splendor is better in my opinion.

Probably the best of the "Splendor killers." Unfortunately, it can take a little long and the actions feel a bit repeptitive. The art is gorgeous on the jumbo cards and the resource bowls are a nice touch. For the price, this is an alright game.

They say this game is the "new Splendor". 

That might be true, I'm not really sold on that.  Yes, this is a light intro game if anyone is looking to get into board gaming.  

The idea here is to collect cards that help you to gain spices that then help you to acquire point cards and/or coins.  Once you have enough point cards to trigger the end game conditions based on the number of players you add up the card totals plus any coins acquired and high score wins.

Pretty simple but it's the drafting/purchasing of the cards that make the game and the limited actions one can perform with the various spice cubes.  It's a wonderful game, quick to set up with the included cups and really accessible.  

Love it.

I really enjoyed this engine building game. Collecting the right cards to get the cubes and conversions that I need. Also, turning cards in at just the right time to get the most points. A very easy game to learn and teach ANYONE. Having to give up spices to take market cards further down in the row give tough decisions of when to take those powerful cards... or when to take the weaker card with free spices!

I can understand the desire to maintain elegant mechanisms a la Splendor, but in practice, Century: Spice Road falls into the dreaded zone of simplicity that devolves into tedium. The game overstayed its welcome as we each built cube-churning machines in our own little worlds, and it was dreadfully easy to calculate how much time you had to complete your set before anyone could hope to threaten your points quarry. Last, but not least, it is red/green colorblind-unfriendly and awfully so. 

All in all, this felt like a lukewarm exercise in resource conversion. Cube-pushing never once bothered me before, but I suppose when a game like this literally consists of that action ad nauseam, the boredom sets in quick. 

(+) Clean, crisp art style on cards.
(+) Simple, accessible, straight resource conversion.
(+) Language independent.

(-) Lacks player interaction.
(-) Lacks pacing and tension, and becomes tedious at the maximum player count. Repetitive gameplay.
(-) The card variety is uninspired and provide little incentive for replayability.

The game is very simple to learn and teach as it only has a few rules (only a page of them, in fact!), but it offers enough depth to keep me interested, especially considering its rather short play time of approximately 30 minutes. It combines engine-building, deck-building, and set collection into a very accessible package.

The best thing about this game; however, is its flow. Turns run by very quickly and after doing an action, you might find that its your turn again after a few seconds, regardless of player count!

The game is not without its flaws though. The largest I can see (and will probably test it out soon enough) is that it looks to be unfriendly to the color blind. Green, Red and Brown are three of the main colors used throughout the game and these can lead to difficult times for the color blind. Aside from that, luck plays a pivotal role in the game. Early appearances of key cards (such as the 4 Turmeric Spice Card) can swing things in the favor of those who manage to snag it early.

All in all, this is quick fun game with minimal down time, which provides a good amount of depth for its short play time.

Everyone says this game is like Splendor but it plays slightly different.  In this game, you are trying to optimize your upgrade path, from yellow to red to green to brown cubes. And of course, you are trying to do this faster than the other players.   There's also a deck building aspect to this game which is interesting.  To me, this game is slightly more fun than Splendor.

[b]Caveat:[/b] I’ve only played this as a 2-player game, my :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown: are based on that.

:thumbsup: Very easy rules (they fit on one page) that provide an interesting game despite their brevity.
:thumbsup: It's one of those games that just make you feel 'zen' while playing.
:thumbsup: Feels strontly 'multiplayer solitaire'. I can appreciate that, but gamers who don't are better off steering clear of this game.

----

:thumbsdown: The promise that this is the first part of a trilogy might be a double-edged blade. I'll be disappointed if parts II and III just provide more of the same. But if they'll be as simple and elegant as this iteration while providing extra layers of complexity to the gameplay if combined, I'll definitely be buying them in 2018 and 2019.

RATING: 9
It is a pretty simple game. The components are AWESOME. Played a 3 player game. My 7 year old picked up the game after a few rounds. I think this game is very similar to Splendor. However, I like Splendor better. Mainly because this game can get repetitive closer to the end of the game. You have the same set of cards throughout the game and i tend to use the same combo of cards to get resources, sure I will get some new cards but it doesn't change the way I get resources a whole lot. The fun part is how you chain your cards together to get the most resources in the most efficient way. I think the game can get repetitive if you play the game casually without thinking much. However, I can see it being fun and challenging if you really think about creating a combo. If you play this game over and over, I am sure you can come up with a way to win every time, just like you know which cards are good to get and what works well with what card. I look forward to the expansions. Overall I like it, great family game.

Quick-playing little hand-building resource-converting game with a pretty design, not unlike Splendor if it had more mechanical choices and longer-term planning.

For me now, century spice road is one of those games. After what 13 plays, there's things I wished they did slightly differently and some of the cards are a tiny bit too powerful. But nevertheless, it's been a gaming highlight of 2017, but it's not the game of the year.

Playtested this a ton when it was still called Caravan. This game is simply incredible. It is the epitome of a cube pusher, but one heck of an engaging one. The mechanics are very simple as you combo cards to convert cubes into different cubes to eventually buy victory points. This one offers some depth and really fun engine building opportunities. This was a huge hit with non-gamers and gamers alike, so much so that a co-worker wanted to print out her own print and play copy. I'll be picking this one up as soon as it becomes available.

This game is comparable to Splendor but I think it is better. Only the Production cards can be very overpowered when they turn up during setup.

This game looks simple, but it the amount of planning required is very impressive. I found myself constantly unsure about the quickest ways to complete my goals. I feel like the beginning player has a slight advantage (despite the "additional resources" rule to help mitigate this), due to the fact they have the first pick of the public market cards. In both games I played, the beginning pool featured a clearly powerful card surrounded by mediocre cards. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this game.

Ami egy full absztrakt játék, ahol 4 féle kockával próbálunk úgy bűvészkedni, hogy megszerzésük, cserélgetésük után jól be tudjuk őket váltani győzelmi pontot adó kártyákra. Bizonyos számú megszerzése a cél a játék végefeltételéhez, így nem fix hosszú a játék, lehetnek gyors és lasabb menetek, de átlagosan 20 perces egy parti.

I quite like the game though it doesn't have WOW factor. It's basically an abstract efficiency game. Swap and convert colored cubes until you have the correct amounts to fulfill a displayed contract (similar to the quest fulfillment in Lords of Waterdeep). That said, it's a quick and simple game - a great filler or prelude to the main event. So for what it is, it does well. Production values and art are all very nice including metal coins and a proper storage insert.

This gateway game fell flat for me. Here you are building a deck where each card either gains you cubes or convert cubes to a different color in order to complete contracts. I liked the hand management/engine building aspect, but I felt once your built your engine (4 ish cards?), there was little reason to buy more cards. So then it just became running your engine until game end. At least in the game we played no one seemed willing to spend cubes in order to get the earlier cards in pool. So this seemed like a wasted mechanic. I also felt like there was a lot of time spent sliding the cards down, again because no one was buying the earlier cards. I would prefer to play other gateway games over this. 

A Note on Production:
I think the mat (purchased separately) is overrated, especially for the price. Also the inclusions of the bowls was nice, but I felt like you needed another set for the people on the other side of the table.

This or Splendor? They are different, yet similar. I think I prefer Splendor because the cards you buy help you purchase other cards where I feel this game the cards just help you do resource conversion and at some point you have to spend a turn taking back your hand which feels unproductive, but, everyone has to do this. Splendor has a consistent forward momentum whereas Spice Road has starts and stops and backtracking.

It feels a lot like Splendor, but because it can take a lot of steps to exchange resources it is hard to judge how many turns it will take to claim various cards. My score my rise with more plays.

A nifty engine builder that is not a Splendor-killer for me. It does its own thing, and does it well, but can be frustrating when there are no good cards in the offer for any player to buy. 

I did feel like there is potential for the first player to get a significant advantage if there is only one good card available in the initial deal, which could leave them room to capitalize while others are building their engine, and run away with the victory before anytime had a chance to catch up. Hopefully when Eastern Wonders is integrated, it will fix that.

An engine building strategy game where players compete for victory points. The betting system on cards ensures that eventually the card will be worth it to be picked up just for the value of the cubes on it. 
The coin system makes it so that certain victory point cards gets a bonus and can incentivise multiple players to go for one card at a time. Also getting 3 extra victory points can be an incentive to go for a card where the cube cost may be less enticing than another card on the board. The cards move over after the coin has been claimed so a player can plan to get another card in the queue when it is the coin card.
Players can choose to get a bunch of cards or scoop up the discard pile for an action this mechanic encourages players to actually build an efficient system to convert spices so they can buy the victory point cards. The spices aren't as limited so it doesn't feel as much like the players are competing with the supply and more that they are competing for an efficient engine to get the victory cards needed to win.

Game has similarities to the much superior Splendor. It is a light-weight engine building (resource a->resource b->resource c) type game that plays rather quick.

However, not really a fan of this game. First off, there is the lack of theme and it is too light to my taste. That said, Splendor and a slew of other such type games have that too. But I mainly lack the appeal. Where splendor allows you to collect and spend, here after a few turns you have a simple transition engine in your hand that you repeat ad infinum, grabbing the directly available victory cards as they appear.

Grab a few cards with a nice mix (transition red to green/yellow, green to red/yellow and yellow to red/green with some yellow mentioned above substituted for brown and your golden), start your engine and cruise to victory. 

There is no way to block people from their engine, there is only working your way around theirs to wait with grabbing a certain card to also collect a bonus coin as it progresses through the VP row.

A game with much hype, but ultimately completely forgettable.

tl;dr: accessible but deep enough

I see a lot of people comparing this to [thing=148228][/thing]. I'm not sure why though. OK. Both games require you to gather resources and use those to fulfill cards for points. But in Splendor you simply take the resources you need. In this game you have to use cards to get them and then convert them to other types. And you can expand on your gathering and converting abilities by buying new cards. This uses a system like you can find in [thing=75449][/thing]: drop one resource of any kind on each card before the one you take. You also get any resources that might be on the card that you acquire. This adds a lot more depth then simply taking resources and turning those into cards.
So while this game has a similar complexity when it comes to rule density, the play itself is more complex and deeper. And more fulfilling for me.
So this game is quite accessible but has more than enough depth to be enjoyed by hardcore gamers like me. And with the speed the game has, this is a very solid amount of fun!

Good game, looks beautiful on the table with the beautiful art on the cards and colourful cubes in little cups. Production quality is excellent! I rate this a bit on the low side, because I find this rather light (and that isn't a bad thing), and it is just a game about getting your engine going as efficiently as possible (there are better/deeper games in that category) so it doesn't hit the table all that often. But I would not turn down to play this. For me this is a perfect gateway game that I can pull out when new players ask to play a game, and I can rest assured that it will be a hit with them.

This game is not as good as Splendor. I think people are nuts for saying it's better, and I attribute it to people being awed by the hip new thing rather than actually sitting down and thinking about what makes the game interesting. 

Splendor is a strategic engine-building stripped down to it's mechanical core. Abstract and quick and a neat little puzzle.

Since the score cards and the action cards in Century: Spice Road are separate, there is a much more tactical nature to this game than there is to Splendor. You really can't plan too far ahead, you can just kind of try to prepare for what cards [i]might[/i] come out.

Normally I don't use "tactical" negatively. Generally a tactical game implies that there is a constantly-changing game state that requires a shift of direction, and some of my very favorite games are quite tactical (Indonesia, El Grande, Chicago Express, Imperial), but in an abstract engine-builder without any player interaction, it's a detriment. 

The prospect of a modular game system that can offer 7 different games is a neat little marketing gimmick, but for $120, I'd rather buy a single game with some teeth rather than a series of rinky-dink games that you probably won't really combine all that often.

It's pretty and it's fast, but it is also cold and dry, and the theme is as pasted on as Splendor. In fact this just feels like Splendor, but without the nice poker tokens. If you love Splendor you will probably love this because it is more of the same. Personally, I think Splendor is the better game because I feel it gives more of a sense of progression through start, mid-game, and end, with a better sense of a culminating finish.

This is becoming one of my favorite games. The game moves very quickly and it is a constant puzzle to figure out how to trade for the spices you need. Some people have said some of the cards are unbalanced but I think their criticism is unwarranted. The game is balanced well to allow tough decisions regarding when to spend cubes to pick up a certain card. Overall it is a quick, simple to learn game which offers a lot of tactical decisions and engages you the whole time.

Century: Spire Road is literally about trading cubes for other cubes and using those cubes to score points.  That is the type of game I try to avoid at all costs.  But in this case, the game is light and quick enough that I could live with it.

C:SR feels kind of similar to [thing=148228][/thing] in its simplicity and weight, but the decisions are more interesting and meaty.  It felt a bit random in my first play, but I got the impression that there was a whole level of strategy that I was barely beginning to scratch.  I'd be happy to play this a few more times to see how deep the strategy gets.

The comparison to Splendor is there and it's really close.
While in Splendor the price for each card differs and the benefit is always the same (1 free gem - not regarding the points) in Spice Road the price is the same (unless other players passed on a card) but the benefit differs (+1 to +4), but i'ts way harder to see the different benefits for newer players.

Also, what I like in splendour better: while gathering points (cards from higher rows) you still improve your options. In Spice Road you rarely have late game interest in more Trader cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is almost the definition of an average game. Century: Spice Road is driven by the consummate stripped-down, cube-pushing game engine. Turn cubes into other cubes and cash them in for points ... over and over. It's not tedious, exactly, but the turns start to feel same-y quite quickly. There's nothing wrong here ... everything works quite well. It's just that there's not much to get excited about, either.

Really nice light and casual game, good gateway to nerdier fair or compromise for non-geek friends and family to avoid playing a game with zero substance when they won't play something with more complexity in your collection. I keep hearing it get compared to Splendor, but I honestly feel like that's a disservice... This game actually has more complexity in my mind or at least is quite different in how it's strategies work. Doesn't take too long to play, rewards good plan, but RNG of the decks will keep each game different enough no one player should always have victory on lock.

I'd say wait till it happens to factor it into any decision, but an interesting feature is the designers claim this is the first of three games they plan on releasing that can be "combined" in some manner. Could be interesting, but it's big talk that needs backing up, wouldn't buy it just on that promise... That said, it's a modest price tag for a strong game as is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
First play impression: I don't like Splendor very much. The gameplay is fine, but it's really luck dependent and a dominant strategy has emerged. A number of games have out-Splendored Splendor since its release, but Century might just be the definitive Splendor killer.

This game is the height of elegance. You just take one of these simple actions on your turn, and everything is so straightforward that you don't need the rules after the initial setup. The game is nothing but two stacks of cards and four colors of cubes. It's all so simple and it works so well.

What's fun about it is the combos. Not combos in the traditional sense, because you only ever do one action at a time. You carry out your combos over the course of several turns. Maybe early on you get some cards that let you convert groups of yellow cubes into groups of stronger cubes. So now you want to snatch up cards that give you extra yellow cubes, play out those cards, then play your conversion cards to get a nice group of stronger cubes. It's a fun puzzle and it changes as the available cards get taken and new ones come into play.

The speed of play and player count seem like they will be perfect (I've only played a two player game so far, though). Turns are so fast that even at five players I imagine the time won't be a problem.

One big advantage that this has over Splendor is the versatility of the game's currency (the cubes). In Splendor it is common for a new card to flip over and just hand somebody a bunch of points because they have the perfect random assortment of gems. In Century there tends to be more crossover with the costs on the points cards, so you have to decide which card to go for. Maybe a new card flipped over that will give you an easy six points on your next turn, but instead you can choose to save up for an 18-pointer. If somebody grabs a big points card before you get to it, you can usually just switch around some of your cubes and get one or two other cards that are a comparable value.

So overall I'm really impressed. I was hoping for a dead-simple game that I could explain in two minutes and still get enough enjoyment from it myself, and that's exactly what I got. I've only played once so my opinion could change, but as of now this may be the best game of the year.

Update: Still really liking the game, but I am a little worried about a start player advantage if one of the stronger cards (free brown cube, three upgrades, four yellow, or two yellow and a red) is in the first or second position at the beginning of the game. In a recent game the start player got the "1 brown cube" card for free on the first turn and went on to have an easy win. This gives quite an advantage because other players have to take time to build up to brown and this player can get it on every other turn right from the beginning. Someone mentioned this on the forums but was summarily dismissed, which unfortunately tends to happen even with legitimate balance concerns.

In general I like that the cards aren't balanced in Century, because when one of the stronger cards comes out of the deck you have to consider how much you would "pay" to get it, and you can try to push your luck and hope it sticks around long enough for you to get it for cheaper. But when one of the strongest cards comes out during setup and there's no decision to be made, it's a problem. Will have to see how often this happens in future games and how it effects the outcome.

Not a Splendor killer. It is not even a very entertaining engine builder because all you get is is more resource/action efficiency, not actual resources. That is not very exciting.

Playing Century, I look at my hand of cards and the goal cards. Do I have the cubes to claim a goal? No. Can I play a card to get the cubes? It will take 7 plays and 3 resets. Is that a good number of turns? Can my opponent claim the card in less than 10 turns? Will the cards in the market speed that up? I don't know and I don't care.

Century: Spice Road - The first time through, I would say that I liked it better than Spendor. But during the second game, Century Spice Road showed it had a flaw that almost no 'receive spices' or 'trade up' cards came out and mostly just 'trade down' cards came out that pretty much caused the game to just grind to a halt forcing people to  keep resting and reusing the few cards they had in their hand. There seemed no strategic way out of the situation, and the game was pretty much broken.

I had heard that this game was a "Splendor-Killer", but I didn't have much more of an idea what it was than that. I see where people get that idea from, but I disagree with the premise.

Century: Spice Road is pretty much the definition of a cube pusher. You start with a couple of cards that let you get yellow cubes and upgrade them. Yellow cubes can be upgraded into red cubes, which can be upgraded into green cubes, which can be upgraded into brown cubes. Those colors are referred to as various spices in the rules, but you'll never really think of them that way. There's additional cards you can get which allow you to do all sorts of transformations, like turning five yellow cubes into two brown cubes or two brown cubes into three greens and a red and a yellow. The point of converting cubes is to buy point scoring cards. Scoring cards give you some number of points and cost some combination of cubes. The higher point cards typically require the "better" colored cubes.

A lot of the game is simply cycling through production chains. At the end of a chain you might end up with more cubes or better colors of cubes or a combination of both. This was the one thing that really hit me about the game. The theme was barely draped over the cube manipulating mechanism of the game. I did enjoy playing the game, but I was constantly aware that I was just grinding through a set of transformations to get the right quantity and color of cubes. I know this will probably put some people off. And honestly, I'm not sure if it is something that sits perfectly well with me either. I'm not sure if more plays will lead to me dismissing it as not an issue at all or rubbing me the wrong way.

There's a card row of merchant cards with the standard "put a cube on a card to take a card further down the card row" bit, with the newer cards starting at the far end of the row. There's a little bit of luck in the order that cards come out, both in the scoring cards and the merchant cards that you add to your deck, but it seems fine for this length of game.

I liked this game. It seems a bit fiddly and complicated compared to Splendor. It also ran a bit longer with five than Splendor. For those reasons I don't consider it a Splendor-killer. And despite that both games are largely abstract with a thin veneer of theme tacked on, this one felt like the game mechanisms were poking through the theme a bit more.

I was hoping for a Splendor killer, since Splendor is unbelievably boring. Ultimately, this is maybe a bit better than Splendor, at a similar weight.

RATING: 8
Only one play so far, but I like it and probably more than Splendor.  However, because there are more choices the game is much more loose at 2p compared to Splendor which is a bummer.  This is a very solitary game at 2p which is a definite negative.  Not sure if I'll keep the 8 rating.

Got one play in, definitely has that Splendor vibe to it.  I think they over produced it to compete with Splendor's chips.  I'm a huge sucker for metal coins, but I've never felt they were more useless than in this game, you never really touch them, they're not a resource that changes hands, you grab then and forget them. 

The game is solid, but it's another nose to the table, zero conversation game of being efficient. I wish the had made it cheaper and more compact, it would suite the game play better than the overwrought production.

It's good, but not great.  The theme feels very artificial (nobody uses actual spice names - they just say "brown cubes, yellow cubes") and there isn't enough player interaction for my taste.

I heard this would be the Splendor 'killer' but it didn't turn out that way.

Beautiful art, but it just doesn't hold my interest for long.

A game I had not played before, which was described as "...like 'Splendour'..." which did not bode well as I do not like the abstraction of gem cutting and jewellry making at all! To be fair, their are similar mechanics, so I understood the context as play progressed. I do like this game - the victory point cards can screw you if you have production of certain spices and the 'wrong' ones come out or players who precede you in the turn take the cards you want! That happened a few times but there isn't an appreciable advantage in being before another person as the card draws are random on all counts although the game does give the later players some advantage. One I would play quite regularly as I know I could improve the result....

Feels like the next step after Splendor in progression of this genre. Doesn't do anything revolutionary. The theme is well used as well but it works for this game although it's not prevalent. The art and components are pretty good. I can see AP being an issue for some. Some of the cards seem pretty unbalanced as well and luck plays a part in being able to grab some of those when they pop up. Overall the game is fun but nothing mind blowing.

I don't know if is a Splendor-killer as many have said, they both feel different but accomplish the same goal, a nice quick light euro that can be played within 20 minutes. The production quality is really good and I can't wait to see how it combines with the next Century game.

RATING: 8
Absolutely brilliant. Yea sure, the theme is cold, and truth be told I'd have preferred the Golem edition to inject a bit more life and colour into the game, but as is, mechanically I still love it.

I get that there's a lot of hype over games but I'm never subject to it because I pay no attention to it. If I hear about a game and think I'll like it, I'll follow it closely towards its release, and I came into this knowing almost exactly what the game would be.

I say almost, because what I was delighted to find was the dispersion of trade cards - initially there's a lot of focus by players on [i]up[/i]grades or up-trades, yet one of the most powerful things facilitated by the trade cards is [i]down[/i]-trading from the most valuable spices to numerous spices of lower value. Depending on the draw, this can be a super-efficient way of getting the resources needed to score.

I also like that dependency on the draw - every game is different and you make a new assessment each game as to what your capabilities are, so it's not always about the same efficiencies every session. It's more about understanding what's available to everyone and what each opponent is taking, then combating their approach the best way you can.

RATING: 5
One word - overproduced. This is a very basic cubes-to-VPs conversion game. I guess it works fine as a gateway, but I've played far too many games to be amazed by something like that. Playing Century with 5 players was probably a mistake, everything just dragged. There aren't enough interesting decisions during a turn to justify the downtime. 

By the way, the coin mechanism is really out of place, it shouldn't be included in this design. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A must-buy for anyone who enjoys Splendor. I disagree that it's an outright Splendor-killer, since they're both excellent games that check in at notably different game weights. I'd strongly recommend picking up the playmat for Spice Road, though, since it really helps to sell the slightly tacked-on theme.

I had some fun playing this game thus far. I think it works because it's so short. If the game lasted any longer than it does, it would probably get tedious. As it is, it's a fine game and moves quickly enough that it keeps the players engaged. Best played from the gut and not bogged down by AP.

it was introduced to me as the substitution for Splendor.
It does resemble it a lot and it has some better aspects... I wouldn't throw Splendor away.

I particularly appreciated the way you can build your own engine: in CenturySR you are not getting the producer of one kind of good but rather a transformer of a good in another one. Thus, you need to carefully take those cards that build you an effective engine.
The coins on some of the cards are a particularly nice touch because everyone tries to race for those cards or waits while the card they are building reaches the coin-zone.

Like Splendor, (but maybe not that much) I guess also CenturySR will be quite repetitive after a while. But it is definitely a nice and fun gaming experience.

Very nice material but, in case you buy the playmat, beware: it stinks unbearably.

RATING: 8
Not sure yet about the power balance with the "upgrade three" card, but a very nice ride with three or four players.


Update:  It has proven to be well balanced, as long as the "upgrade three" doesn't appear at the beginning of the game.  It's a great filler, and great wind-down game after a heavy game.

RATING: 9
Lovely theme, attractive art, simple to teach, reasonably quick to set up. Each turn plays quickly, because types of actions are limited, yet there are interesting decisions to make. The one thing about it that really bugs me is that saffron is such a low-value commodity, when it should have the highest value. Though the theme is thin with this one in the first place, that point in particular totally ruins what little immersion I might feel.

Family strategy card drafting engine builder.  Draft spice worker cards that gain, convert and upgrade spice cubes to complete set collection contracts.  Beautiful production.  Has an obvious Spendor feel.  I like that it costs an action to refresh played cards to add to the efficiency equation. I like that your spice inventory is constrained.  Not sure what I think about the waiting game for the first and second position bonuses on contracts but it is a big part of strategy.  Quick turns and quick play. It doesn't have the A/P proneness as its counterpart. After a while I feel I'm just moving and switching colored cubes around and then that takes me into deeper philosophical pondering of why gaming is so much fun?

Collect cards to trade cubes for other cubes and then claim victory points by selling off your cubes. This game was described as a 'Splendour-killer' when it first came out.  That's not wholly accurate but it does fill a similar niche to Splendour while being a bit more interesting.  It's simple and easy to teach (like Splendour) but with a bit more variation between games and more thought required.

Played 3 times in a row during a tournament.

I don't understand why it gets so much praise: it's quite boring, the merchants row is too static, lacking the combos, lacking production cards and wit a very odd (to be kind) balance.

it hasn't killed Splendor in my opinion: it needs to borrow some things from Splendor to give a Splendor v2.

The hand building of Concordia in a Splendor length/weight game works very nicely.  Setting up trading combos in your hand and racing to the best point cards while taking time to jump on nice card gaining opportunities that come up makes for a pleasant amount of thought in the game without getting too deep.  This worked nicely with my kids and was well received at game night so might be one of those special games that works for almost any group.  Glad I listed to the hype and got this one!

I can see why people call it the "Splendor Killer". Nevertheless, I feel that comparing it to Splendor is cheating. 
The feeling may be similar, bur Splendor is a full abstract engine builder while in Century: Spice Road you have this resource management and deck/engine building mechanics that really give more depth to a fairly simple and elegant game.
Great work.

Nagyon vártam, ódákat zengtek róla, ennek ellenére kis túlzással kínszenvedés volt. A Splendorral való összehasonlítgatást nem nagyon értem, de nem is ez a baj vele. Sőt, igazából baj sincs vele, csak nagyon mechanikus és száraz az egész, sok gondolkodnivaló nem akad (azért kicsit kell). És hát az ára. Persze ez nem befolyásolja a játékmenetet, de egyértelműen visszatartó erő, hiszen ennyiért azért még mindig kapni nagytáblás játékokat, ez meg gyk. egy nagyon egyszerű kártyajáték pár fakockával. Belegondolva, h ennyiből kijön 3 másik kártyás játék is, hát nem tudom miért ezt választanám.

Purchased instead of Splendor because it was released this year (2017) and my SO doesn't like games with poker-chip style tokens.

[b]1st play, 3p[/b]:

At its heart it's a fast-paced tactical cube-pusher with great components, although the cubes feel out of place and detract it somewhat from the theme. I suppose you can even call it an economic game as you're constantly converting spices from one type to another, then cashing them in to score points. I'm interested to see the future Century games and how they all connect. No, you don't need to buy the overpriced playmat. Maybe the Golem edition is nicer.

Initial rating: [b]7.25[/b]

[b]Bonus[/b]: Here's a couple of things we did wrong:

1) "A trade can be done any number of times in a row as long as you have the appropriate cubes available."
2) "To acquire a Merchant card, first pay for it by placing ANY cube from your caravan on each Merchant card to the left of the card you are acquiring and then take that Merchant card into your hand."

Very similar to Splendor in its mechanic; the artworks are very beautiful but do not manage at all to give a sort of background to this game, which remain too mach abstract at the end...

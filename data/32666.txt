This feels very original with a nice market mechanism. I also like the assymetric start-up. The banks seem to be the (only?) way to go and the end game can drag a bit as not every player is in a position to end it even they want to but I always enjoy it.

Interesting game, though I felt it was a bit too long for what it offered. I did enjoy the player-driven market, especially when it turned in my favour! Good clean functional design of the hex tiles, although an unfortunate side effect is that it looks rather bland.

I would call this a heavy economic game. I like the market mechanic, but find that unless ALL PARTICIPANTS are really comfortable with the rules, the game isn't any fun.

I value the effort to make this kind of thing work though. The interesting "hex/circle" mechanic is very noteworthy.

Solo una partida, es un juego económico muy muy bueno si te gustan esta clase de juegos. Es seco y feo de cojones, desde la portada hasta los componentes en sí, pero dentro de la abtracción del juego encontramos una mecánica muy bien pensada y todo encaja a la perfección. El tema del comercio puede alargar bastante la partida, pero quitando eso, el juego es sencillo de reglas pero muy duro de calcular todas las cifras y planificar el avance. Un frie neuronas, sobretodo la 1a partida jeje Con ganas de repetir. 

Ojo! Mirar de jugar con la "2a versión de reglas" que reduce la duración del juego y lo equilibra más.

Played twice now, would like to play again but it is quite time consuming for what it is, also feels unbalanced towards certain strategies but need to play more to determine it.

Planet Steam has replaced this entirely as it is what I had hoped this game would be like

Wealth of Nations lacks:

- A dynamic market (prices rarely fluctuate up and down very far within a turn or do something unexpected, the game leads you down a set path and it takes great pains to change it and likely it will end up badly for you if you try to get in another players way as it just hurts both of you)

- Flexible production, you can't switch very easily to be producing gaps in the market, if you start overproducing something it is likely to kill your game as you have wasted your investment in infrastructure and killed your prices. Once you are in this position you are stuck with it, congratulations you can now sit back and watch someone else win.

- bang for your buck, the game takes too long, it overstays its welcome past the 2 hour mark; don't get me wrong I like long games, this just doesn't fill the time sufficently to make it worth it.

I don't like the direction they took with the expansion either and included armies that can block production? I think I'll keep passing on it for now.

A very well-designed game that didn't click for me on first play.  A little heavier than I usually like them, but if you want a "next step" after [b]Power Grid[/b], look no further.  Seemed a little on the longish side for me.

RATING: 5
A pseudo-area control market game.  Spend certain resources to produce others to use and/or sell the produced resources to other players and/or on the market.  Use of the pre-designated player trade prices is nigh mandatory to speed up game play.

Though I've only played one 4 player game, I suspect this scales poorly up to 5 players.  With 4 it felt very crowded and very competitive, a bit too much so.  The person in last place was in last not only due to poor choices on his part, but also due to the actions of the players who were near him on the board (the two of them definitely crowded him and pushed him further back).  There's no chance for redeeming poor choices, poor market position or poor location.

Probably plays best with 3 players, not only for room on the board and market availability, but also for game length.  5 players will take a *long* time, I strongly recommend against it.  Even 4 players took a while.  I also do not recommend playing with the AP-prone.

Sectioning off your own private portion of the board is huge for the early-to-mid game, and may provide you with a fair lead.

One problem with this game is that it pushes players into specialization.  You want to focus on one or two particular types of goods (out of 6 possible types).  The game is designed not only to enable players to monopolize at least one or two markets, but it heavily rewards those players.  It seems like the player with the best and/or strongest monopoly wins.

In addition, the types of goods are worth drastically different amounts.  Monopolizing a difficult, high-cost market, even though you may not be able to utilize the produced goods to directly power your factories (at least initially), may be preferable to monopolizing an easier, low-cost market.

The above-noted different values for goods played a large role in my game.  At the end, I had a total monopoly on the black goods (whatever they are) and had a ton of them (+20) sitting in my resource pool.  At the end of the game, I was able to sell them back to the market with no competition and reap a *huge* amount of money.  (And I mean *HUGE*.)  That windfall easily won me the game.

Also, the game area (board) is not very dynamic.  Pieces are not moved much.  Coupled with the critical nature of arranging them correctly based on their pattern, this issue becomes significant.  A bad placement can be problematic, if not disastrous.

Give it a shot if you like market games, but I really don't think it's all that great of a game.  I could be talked into playing it again, but it wouldn't be an easy coercion.

A monster economic game. A style that I enjoy a lot. This game have a lot of negotiation, market manipulation, demand, production, etc etc.

It reminds me a lot of Planet Steam in terms of the way things produce and the way you can manipulate the market. But they differ quite a bit to justify playing both.

The only downside here is the play time and some problems with the flux of this game when someone keep playing his turn in order to fulfill a failed negotiation, in this manner I prefer Planet Steam, since you cannot negotiate with other players, so the market system is more precise.

Played part of a game with my sister and a dummy player. Feels like Power Grid with the buying and selling actions based on changing market values. However, we think it may have a runaway leader effect because by the time about half the board was filled, the dummy was starting to really take off in cube production while my sister and I were languishing and going nowhere fast. The game almost seems entirely based on the following cycle: Use money to buy cubes, use cubes to buy buildings and power/feed buildings, use powered/fed buildings to generate cubes, use cubes to sell for money... and then the player with the most money wins. Wow, just typing this all out sounds boring. Given that the suggested game time is so long, is it really worth it? 2015 UPDATE: An obvious choice for the trade pile.

A clever design. It really streamlines a few economies down into a system that can be managed and played without too much fuss. Less fiddly than most euros while doing all of the same things that most of them do, engine building, upgrade optimization, area control, and (to a lesser extent) spacial reasoning.

That said, there's no catchup mechanisms. Economies can stall and die, unable to really course-correct. There's nothing to stop players from completely screwing you over and shutting your engine down. If you can't enjoy a game unless you're doing well, this won't be the game for you. It's probably better to think of it less as a game and more as a simulator. But a cool one.

I thought I would like this game but after 2 plays I think its only so-so.  The game has great concepts, but the play is tediuosly slow and the end game is painful.

Good time.  Not sure if all the starting positions are balanced, but I get the feeling they are.  A LOT of time is spent in the trading/bartering part of the turn, which is important, but can be very frustrating for someone who is falling behind (they'll have less to trade with).  Overall though, I think it plays well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on one play.  I love economic games.  I think that this game has potential, but I think that it may possibly also be broken if players don't cooperate.  You need to be comfortable with deficit spending if you don't want to fall behind, and you also need to be certain to put flags on area you may want before others in order to keep others out of your territory, and disrupting your plans.

Some will consider this very fiddley.

I think those that start out as farmers may be at a disadvantage.  Looking forward to another play to test out my learnings.

6 may be too many for this game as it took 4.5 hours including teaching for the first game.

RATING: 6
One of the driest games I have ever played.  All those one money increments - too small to agonise over but necessary that you do if you are do well.  This game is just like a hard day at the office.  Engrossing but not much fun.  I went for 12 loans in round one to add some excitement, not expecting the tactic to pay off.  It almost did and maybe would have if I hadn't made a mistake near the end - some two hours later.  The boards contain some indents to hold the cubes in place which is very neat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A pure, abstracted economic game that lasts a bit too long for my tastes mostly as a result of the protracted trading/barter/haggling phase. I liked the asymmetrical startup which forces players into vastly different and relatively even-strength strategies. The interconnectedness of the market, resources and producing tiles is very well thought out but a bit opaque making AP a serious probability. Feels like you are a cog in a complex economic model.

it feels to me a lot like Container.

it is quite long, you need to be very concentrated the whole time, and in the end the negotiations part turns out not important. pretty chaotic, what others decide to do after you is more important than what you've chosen...

I was pretty excited about this game, but after 2 tries I don't really need to play more. I'd rather play traders of genoa for the negotiations part, and many other games for the optimization/economic part. give me 18al or indonesia for picking my companies and having them grow.


also, put me firmly in the '4 player game is unbalanced' camp. in a 4 player game I believe the companies chosen must be yellow-yellow-notBlack

I played a demo version of this at KublaCon. It is a very tight economic game--I always wanted to do more than my meager resources would allow. It has a feel similar to Power Grid, although without the fallback/surge ahead tactics. My rating will likely increase after additional plays (once my preorder arrives). I began with labor and quickly expanded to finance.

I read the rules and watched a five player game.    My take on Wealth of Nations is that players are sort of reliant on the mutually beneficial actions of trading with other players.  If players play poorly, the game stalls (think Container!)

To be honest, I really have no desire to actually play Wealth of Nations.  Someone needs to convince me that the design is worth playing before I try it out.  The polka dot design doesn't really draw me in.

Some rules/protocols can be streamlined to quicken the pace of play without compromising any of the rules or intent of the game.

UPDATE: Promissory notes are broken.  There is no reason not to take a large quantity very early on since one does not need to pay interest.

This game could be quite good but needs more play testing and tweaking.

Although the strategy is there and multiple paths to victory exist, this game is just not FUN to me.  I came out feeling like I had just spent hours filling out tax forms.

Initial impressions:

Interesting game.  The market didn't fluctuate very much for us, just increased and increased in price until someone ran out of flags, then had a large selling turn.

I didn't enjoy the spatial aspect of the game much at all; I found it to be the weakest part.  Too easy to get blocked in and have to waste capital to get out.

Being a banker I think the promissory notes are "broken".  I think that in addition to receiving less $ as you take out more prom notes while having to retire the notes at face value, at the beginning of each turn you should have to make an interest payment of $1 on each outstanding note.  That would take the time value of money into consideration.  Maybe I'll make this a house rule...
EDIT the V2 "Warcloud" rules fix the prom note issue.  We played with interest on debt and it was punishing to carry too much debt (as it should be)

Interesting market building and trading/selling game. Like Acquire, you are playing an abstract model of the markets in play. Wheeling and dealing is very important, but so is eeking out a choice niche on the board. A real mini-maxers dream game. For the trouble and money-making angle, I prefer Imperial because it has a more tangible theme.

Very interesting economic game. The tiles are 100% abstract, but their implementation isn't 100% so (having lots of labor always creates some inefficiency, like in unions, and banking tiles only are strong when put together).

Just don't play with jerks who don't understand the concept of negotiation, or the trading rounds will go on forever.

(some have commented that the red cubes are too strong. Since the only time I played this I won by a mile investing in red-cubes, it might not be too farfetched... But it seems that the game is currently going under revision, which is good. There were definitely some rough edges to smooth out from the original design)

Provisional rating - but likely to climb to a 10, need to play it a bit more to see what the long term life is like.

Like this one a lot. Gives me the feel of playing an 18xx game but with less playtime, although I haven't tried it with more than 4 so far.

There might be an optimum pick with the starting packets, but I'll need a significant number of games to be sure - and then we can just change them or go with a cash & cubes start instead.

Works well with 3 which is nice. End game is a nightmare though - what were they thinking? Everyone sells one thing at a time around the table ... and you're all likely to have 15 or so ... Instead we just sell all of one type and everyone gets the middle price, works out virtually the same as selling one after another in about 1/50th of the time :)

** Update - starting to see the shine come off this, still a solid game but just isn't getting played now.

 Although I think it would be better with more. I liked it with 3 (and think 2 would be ok although without any sort of catch-up mechanic once you're down, you're done). Felt like more of an economic game than anything I've played other than 18XX and really, it's probably more economic than that. I've played games that are more economic than 18XX, but 18XX feels like you're building up your little engine and then exploiting it. This has the same feel. Loved it and really want to play again soon. 3 player game took right at 3 hours which I don't think is bad.

A real drag that played way too long for what it offered. Stupid negotiations over $1 that lasted forever to slow down an otherwise unoriginal cube resource manipulation exercise. Horribly  abstract that made me feel anything but a nation manipulating resources and supply & demand. Silly colour polka-dot formations splattered across an uninspired board. So bad that 4 of 6 players wanted to quit after 2.5 hours and only two-thirds of the way through this tedium. AVOID!!!

I did kind of enjoy this, but I think that unfortunately the game is probably decided in the first half-hour or so of the 2-hour game. It's all about finding which resource is under-served, but in practice switching gears is so expensive that if you don't get it right in the first quarter or so of the game, you're done. I'd like to play again to be sure. I think it's a great concept, and got clever bits, but I'm just not sure it really works especially given the length.

I think the loans are not as broken as they initially appear. I think they ultimately work OK.

RATING: N/A
What a brain-burner! Plan for the end of the turn and then optimize everything you do to maximize your dollars towards that goal. Almost more work than play.

Issues: seems like taking 6-12 promissory notes per player on the very first turn is standard (from comments hereabouts as well as our own personal observations) -- why not just have each player begin with, oh, say, $100 instead? With no interest on loans (!), this mechanic seems broken in half.... Also, the Trade Phase seems like a study in obviousness: trade/sell your excess commodities to other players who need them, then whatever's left over gets bought/sold one at a time from the various markets. That's it. Oh, and the very last Trade Phase of the game is an exercise in tediousness. Blech.

We're shelving this one indefinitely.

It has great production value, but this game is not fun.  I don't have to win to have fun, but it's nice to be able to complete SOME goal you set for yourself in a game.

I would play again to see if it was better during a non-learning scenario.

This is a VERY cerebal game, if you don't like math then stay away. It also has some spatial element with a territory control aspect much like Through the Desert. The first phase (Trade Phase) is probably needing to be tightened up since it adds probably 3/4 of the time to the game. I plan to try the game by limiting the Bartering aspect of the Trade Phase. Also will consider the $1/loan/round for the promisary notes. Also may try an Auction Mechanic for the beginning draft.Still this is a great game, especially if you like games like Power Grid.

With some tightening up of the game rules, I now really enjoy this game since I can clock it in under 2 hours. A very good economic engine game.

Did not get to finish the game due to outside influences and interuptions, but I like the game for what I did play.

Very "engine" driven, and if you can set it up properly, you can jump out to a very quick lead.  I will have to play again, using the same set-up as I did before, to see if the particular start that I had will create an unstoppable engine.  If so, then its replayability will be sorely limited if your opponents don't plan accordingly.  On the other hand, it may just die out halfway through the game and you are left looking the fool.

Again, I need to play it fully through to get a better handle on my rating and desire to play more than once.

Severe balance problems with 4 players that are mostly mitigated by playing with 5 (in a 4 player game the 3rd & 4th player start with a considerable advantage).  3 is clearly too few.

The loans are silly and clearly under-developed.  Take out 8-12 loans on your first turn and spend them efficiently.  There really is no choice in this area.

This is a not-so-little game of logistical planning (productions sequences again) mapped against an economic and spatial model.  The references to Power Grid are poor.  This is not an auction game, it is a very structured logistical sequence planning game with an economic model thrown in.  Perfect information after initial player seating.  There's considerable butterfly effect from novice players and most of it will manifest as king-selecting.  Becomes fairly rote within 4-6 plays.

Not too surprisingly it reminded me of Container in the market prediction requirements.  Unlike Container the market isn't built on player willingness to pay but on simple consumption, production and excess.  Nicely/neatly done too, but too mechanical for its own good leaving the results alarmingly irrelevant much of the time.

There are pretty much only five decisions in the whole game:

1) What industry to draught
2) Where to build initially 
3) How to efficiently push the other players against each other on the board
4) In the early to early-mid-game which second industry to launch
5) How fast to drive the game to a close

The first three decisions will be made during the first trading round, which will usually last between 60 and 90 minutes.  The game is mostly over at this point.  The fourth decision will either be made in the initial trading round or by the end of the second trading round (which is already the mid-game). The fifth decision is easily missed and occurs during the second or third development round.  Everything else is mostly noise.  The full game should last no more than 4-6 rounds and the more competent the players are the closer that will be to 4.

Horrible aesthetics but what a game.
True to the name of the game, one can really see and understand some of the concepts that Adam Smith wrote about in his book that is usually mentioned as Wealth of Nations.
If you are into economical euro-games this is one of the better games in that genre.
It is necessary to have the expansion though since it is quite unbalanced otherwise.

I was very surprised to find that I really didn't care for this game. It seemed like the type of thing I'd enjoy, but it was on the painful side. I've only played once, and it was a 6p game. Its possible that the game shines with something like 3-4 players, but I doubt I'll ever find out.

The basic engine of the game is the buying/selling of various commodities and trying to manipulate the market a bit. I just found the constant little quibbling to be annoying, and the margins are so thin that it seems like a lot of noise for a dull outcome. In a 6p game, I started with "food" as my commodity, with no good position left on the board as I placed last...and not even a monopoly on my product since another player had the same thing. With that lack of leverage and room to grow, I predictably was never a factor. My one chance to diversify was harmed by 2 other players going into the same commodity simultaneously. Maybe I could have anticipated that, but it made a painful game even more painful.

I would play again if someone had some enthusiasm to try it. I'd recommend playing with 4p, given the choice, since that seems like the number of players most likely to allow the game to "work".

After three years I gave this game a second chance which was a mistake. Four hours of my life wasted. The game is too abstract and takes too many hours to finish. But the main flaw is that the game is too harsh - if you make one early mistake, you are out of the game with no chance to recover. Also, the rules are unclear at some points and I suspect that the game might be broken. Anyway, I have no wish to find it out - rating down from 6 to 3 - I won't play it ever again.

Why isn't this getting more attention? This is one of the richest economic models in a boardgame I've played in a long time. Especially one that can be played in 3 hours. The box says 2+, but we took 4+, and I could see it coming down to 3. The game has zero luck. Nothing. Not even setup. Even still, the economy is so interwoven that 4 of us really could even agree on the value of the 5 resources when trading. For each of the 5 resources, there's a progressive price based on quatity (a la Power Grid, Buy Low Sell High, etc), but it's continuous rather than bucketized like PG. It also has both buy and sell prices, making it a true economy. But of course players are free to value them however they like when trading. Unlike PG where all resources do effectively the same thing (power a plant), resources in WoN each do something very unique. The board is a hex board where players build there "plants" (cube producing blobs, inlcuding things like farms which produce food). But again, it takes various cubes to do various things. And yes, there is also money, which largely just facilitates trading to make up the relative difference in cubes, and to buy/sell cubes when trading doesn't work out. Oops. This is starting to sound like a review. Maybe I'll develop later. Anyway, really good IF you like HEAVY trading negotiations. I do, so I liked it. I'm not sure, but it seems a bit unforgiving, in terms of recovering from a poor start.

The game is about economic and industry. It's easy to understand the rules, but it's not really easy to understand the game. It has very unintuitive game flow. Contrary to other games, it has a lot of options at the beginning but very little options at the end. Confusing. But it's still nice brain burning game.

RATING: 6
Despite the title, Wealth of Nations is - oddly - neither about wealth or nations.  It is about manufacturing in an abstracted landscape, wherein your industries need not even be physically contiguous, and there is no connection to a real world.

There are some nice graphics choices in this design about manufacturing commodities and exploiting their interdependencies.  Unfortunately, the game itself quickly proves tedious, only to devolve into being even more tedious.  To cap it off, it seems to be missing some form of overview or context...such as the nations referred to in the title.  There is a great deal of machinery clanking away on every turn, but no ultimate point to any of it, save for the honor of having the most clanking machinery.

Where Container succeeds on more or less the same subject, WoN does not, because it suffers from endless rounds of single-quantity commerce, involving a contest for physical space that is either superfluous or in bad need of a more realistic context, and [i]more[/i] endless rounds of single-quantity commerce.

This is the purest economic game that I have come across.  The interworkings of key commodities such as food, energy and labor may seem dry at first, but deliver a great gaming experience.  This is abstract, but has the feel of a complete market system.  No luck, just tough decisions and market interactions.

Like economic games?

How about games where it is impossible to avoid interacting with the other players?  

Wealth of Nations is silly good.  It looks as dry as a Triscuit, but is engrossing and cut-throat and empowering.  You (the player) have nothing to blame but yourself when you don't perform well in this game, because everything you need to know is right there in front of you.  The market is clearly laid out, and the other players choices are the only variables to account for.  If someone is winning, you can see how and why they are winning, and you can take direct action to try and stop them--either individually or as a group.  When players focus too much on their own engine it allows for a leader to move too far ahead that they can't be caught, but if players are paying attention to each other, this can easily be hindered with trade-refusals and competition (building similar economies as the leader).  

Each game will play out differently.  Each decision means something for not just one player, but the entire table.  If someone forgets to power their Academy, that directly affects them by not allowing them to gain the Labor it would have produced.  But it also negatively affects the other players who were relying on that player to produce Labor so they could trade or buy it from them instead of the expensive market.  Every decision has cascading effects.  

Do yourself a favor.  Give it a chance.  The theme and appearance may put you off, but don't let it: it is too good of a game to go unplayed.

(NOTE: We use the V2 rules that come with War Clouds)

Nice economic game, but I wonder if it could be streamlined by fixing (or eliminating altogether) the trading rules.  Brass seems to work without trading between players, so this one should as well.  The trading just makes the game last a little too long for what it offers.
Certainly no opportunity for nations to be self-sufficient here (must trade, or buy from market).  Emphasis in mechanics is on specialization--producing as much of one commodity as you can and selling/trading it for what you need.  Very novel design with the tile-laying mechanics.
Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and if it weren't for the length, I would rate it higher.

Played with the War Clouds expansion. The game seemed really intriguing and I'd like to play it again. However, the game took about 6 hours with 5 players, so I hope that is not the norm. I think it's because a couple of players decided to play very aggressive which caused a stall in the game, as resources were being dedicated to attacking/defending instead of building up economic engines.

A surprising game. I didn't know about it until i won it in a contest. Surprising because at first sight the components look bland and the theme seemed a bit "meh".

Again, easy to learn but the winning strategies are not easy to grasp.

Some interesting economic elements, but the multitude of steps required to shift strategies makes for a very low number of decisions available during the course of a game.

Games can drag on for a long time, since buying or selling a single cube from the market takes a turn, and players spend a lot of time haggling with one another over trades to squeeze an extra dollar or two out of them. Analysis paralysis is an issue as well.

Pretty cool and original economic and spatial resource game with 6 different resources that each have a different behavior/purpose. Good market economy and resource mechanics.

Note: you're really going to want poker chips instead of the paper money that comes in this game.

Also, be sure to use the official revised/2nd edition rules. Summary of those changes:

- trade action: up to 3 buys or up to 3 sells at the markets
- reduced starting flags based on player count
- increased starting money ($80 vs $40) for starting commodity packages
- add $10 to starting generator industry package
- reduced starting tile supplies (farms 12, others 7)
- add Phase 0: Pay 1 Interest per loan - forced to take 21st loan = eliminated from game
- final sell-off is a simple distribution of funds instead of multiple trade action rounds

I really wanted to like this game.  There is a good game in here somewhere...I know it.  We just couldn't find it.  We played a 6 player game with hard core negotiators.  The trade phase lasted way too long.  I think it needs to be redone settlers style somehow.  The system lends itself to needling over a few bucks on every trade.  That's its biggest downfall.

Personally, I had the red tile (labor) start and ended up building all but 2 of them.  This crashed the labor market. As a result, I went to war to try to get what I wanted as labor was too dirt cheap to sell for much profit.  the only problem was that blue (energy) was sky high in price.  So my mid to late war machine couldn't ramp up very easily.

The game was aborted after about 5 hours of play.  We had determined that it would be another couple of hours of 4 of us battling against one another while another player plopped down a few tiles and eventually scored the W.

This will some day be a *very* good game: once the rule-set gets developed enough. For now (v2 rules): Every game feels scripted, and once you realize you're not self-sufficient enough, there's really no way out of it. War Clouds might fix some of that, but my group is down on direct conflict. I find myself wishing the game had an army option like '7 Wonders' does. Or that Army size instead gave a discount on trades. Or *something*.

Initial impressions after 1 play:
I was pretty impressed by this game, in particular how streamlined it was.  It's not a simple game, but there is no excess complexity; it's a minimal rules-set to do what it wants to do.  Also, there is no randomness, which is a considerable plus. 

In my first play it struck me primarily as a resource management and economic engine game, plus some on-board play, which I appreciated.  The resource management and planning can be a little fiddly, perhaps on par with Caylus, but that's not too bad.  

There is also  trading, which for our first game we limited by only allowing "barter price" trades, in order to speed things up.  This seemed like a good idea for a first play, but if I were to play again I would want to relax that, because it really took the trading out of play as a strategic element.  I assume that with more experienced players the resource management would become less important and the trading (and perhaps the on-board play) would become the primary focus of the game.

I would guess this would be a 7-9, depending on how well the trading actually works.  Certainly I am intrigued by the idea of a no-luck trading game.

A very solid game, but a bit of a heartbreaking near miss as well.  I had such high hopes for this one, as a properly meaty game from a new designer and unusual publisher.  As it is, it's well worth a look, but it does have a few flaws.  My opinions are based on a single play and a lot of time thinking about the game, so take it for whatever that is worth to you.

First off, the game has been beautifully produced.  The design is strikingly original and the rulebook is both attractive and extremely well written.  Game play works quite well - the various markets crest and tumble as players leap in to compete in different sectors.  The play is also very thematic - each input makes sense in how different industries are created.  The game moves quickly if people understand not to haggle over every trade, and the game length fits easily into the weeknight game session.

There is no luck here, and the better player will stomp the poor players.  The problems are well documented in the forums.  The repayment terms of the promissary notes are too lenient, so what I presume was their intended use (short-term liquidity only, as in Container) is obscured.  This is an easy fix.  Tougher is the sense that the markets lack dynamism, and the spatial board play is overpowering.  Players cannot be denied from getting the inputs they need each turn, as there are no goods shortages or non-linear price spikes.  And the final scoring makes small buying and selling margins fairly unimportant to the end result.  The trading/buying/selling part of the game therefore ends up feeling undramatic, especially considering the physical prominence of the markets.

I think it's a few house rules away from being really good, so I'll follow the discussions and see what people come up with.

Played at BGG.con. Highly enjoyed our session. The game was quick to pick up, flowed nicely and was fun. During the two hours required to play I did not see anything bog us down outside of occasional player paralysis.

The biggest potential downside I saw was if a player failed to plan out a basic strategy and a back up strategy (in case something gets in the player's way.) Also, soft spoken players will get the short end of the trading phase because good are cheapest when plentiful and they are plentiful in the first few rounds of trading. We had one player at the table who failed to assert himself and ended up taking out a lot of loans to afford high priced goods when he could have made trades for much cheaper if he'd spoken up earlier.

There is room to mess with each other's placement on the map, but they've built in a mechanic that allows you to rearrange your locations, which is nice.

Finally, I'm not sure how well this will play with 3 players. With 6 we had a good time (although there were times when waiting for everyone else to pass left me with 5 minutes of down time.) Can't wait to play it again.

Interesting macroeconomic simulation. Terrible game. 

Does cool things with specialization and econoboxes of scale. A semi-Freeform economic game. But as my friend Peter said, it feels like a prototype of a cool game. Every micro-transaction is pretty tedious, and the tedium of turning cubes into other cubes and then into buildings is perfected and amplified, especially as "sell a billion goods to the market one by one" IS THE ENDGAME. Bone dry. 

I want to like this game. I held onto it for 7 years before playing. And I'm glad I tried it; maybe one day I'll use its ideas to make a halfway decent game.

Wealth of Nations is an interesting take on economic production and trade, with a really innovative market-based board setup, wherein the supply and demand of the players' resources can drastically affect how much each one goes for.  While the board is rather abstract, being a bunch of colored hexes that represent various industries, the game itself doesn't feel abstract, as each resource does what you'd expect it to do (food feeds workers, labor populates regions to work in the factories, ore is used mostly to build industries and maintain machinery, etc.), and we generally continue to call the resources by what they are, rather than the color - the resource system certainly makes more sense than something like Catan anyways.

The poor production quality of the hexes, money, and other game pieces is a huge disappointment, especially considering the rather high retail price.  The boards themselves are nice enough, but overall I was not happy with presentation.  Luckily, the gameplay more than makes up for that, and there's a lot of long-term economic planning, mixed with plenty of short-term market and trading opportunism, so the game feels pretty deep, though I haven't played enough to see whether or not it stands up over time, though I have noticed in most games, that the banks seem to be incredibly overpowered, and may need to be nerfed in house rules.  There is a two player variant, but without player-to-player bartering the game feels a little flat, though its still somewhat enjoyable.  Recommended to those who want a nice industrial and market-themed economic game, that isn't too involved, but is deep enough to do justice to the theme.

This game has the hallmarks of a game I should just love: strategy, and not any luck except for beginning turn order which rotates.  Without the roll of dice, or draw of cards, each turn you simply choose what you are going to do from supplies available to everyone.  

Our game had five players and it took FOREVER.  Goods are purchased or sold one at at time, which is necessary to game play.  However, near the end of the game when the goods and money are plentiful, a round drags, and there are lots of rounds.  The game just goes on and on, while each person sells or buys maybe up to 30 goods one at a time, while everyone is trying to end it, doing the same thing over and over.

Perhaps this game would work with 3 or 4, and I would be willing to try it one more time, but with 5, no.  Also, we were learning, so didn't take advantage of the many vicious cut throat possibilities.  This would make it more interesting, but it would still be a long game, and I think that if you positioned poorly eary on or made a mistake, it would be very hard to catch up.

Played again with 5--its the bartering that takes so dang long!!  Don't play with more than 4.

O setup do jogo é bem interessante. Fica um tabuleiro hexagonal no centro e 6 mercados em volta, cada um para um tipo de mercadorias. Os jogadores iniciam colocando os terrenos, que produzem as mercadorias, ou pegando dinheiro e produtos. Fica um visual bem interessante. O jogo basicamente é compra e venda de mercadorias, compra de terrenos e destinação de usos para estes terrenos. A rodada se divide em três fases. A primeira é a trade onde compramos, vendemos nos mercados e trocamos mercadorias entre os jogadores. Depois de uma hora jogando essa fase ficou altamente cansativa. A segunda é o develop onde compramos os terrenos e definimos os usos. A terceira é a prodution onde os terrenos produzem caso você tenha recursos para tal. O jogo começa interessante mas depois fica altamente cansativo pois na fase de trade cada jogador troca um produto de cada vez e isso a deixa muito demorada.

In Wealth of Nations, as the name suggests, players take the roles of nations (that can be oddly dispersed on what goes for a map here) vying for economic supremacy.

On one hand it's an economic game with a merket driven by the players' supply and demand and lots of direct trading and negotiations between the nations, on the other it's a very abstract tile placement optimization game where the nations attempt to place their industries on the board for the highest yields while at the same time strangling their opponents' growth.

Now, strike 1, the negotations game. I'm just not a huge fan of this sort of thing. Strike 2, there are a couple of elements that feel half-baked and underdeveloped (the loan system is ridiculous). And strike 3, the cube min-maxing of resources you need for the next development phase and powering your industries becomes old really fast. Despite a very simple system and very few rounds played the haggling and constant recounting and reallocation of resources make the game go on for far too long.

This is an interesting one.  The game is a no luck game about supply and demand.  The focus is on building up industries and then supplying them with the goods to operate them.  Definitely not a casual game.

Long, and at the mercy of the other player's and whether they decide to compete with you in a resource.  The efficiencies of scale encourage specialization (less energy, single ore once you automate), so it's generally best to specialize and hope the other players leave you alone.

RATING: 6.5
Played with updated rules, war clouds and tile expansion.

The game is based around a production/market system where each player must first acquire resources in the trade phase either through trade or purchasing them on the market, then the commodities are used to expand industries, build armies, and operate those industries to produce more commodities that are then sold or traded and so on.

The combat is very simple and is a way to essentially convert labor/energy/food commodities into other commodities if your neighbors are not wary. I wouldn't play without them but it hardly makes the game a wargame.

Some issues: Credit seems too easy to come by and the penalty even with the updated rules is not very strong. May need to houserule credit in the future. The game is also fairly mathy. One nice aspect are the suggested barter prices which reduce the nit-picking in negotiations, but you need to get the calculator out. Not a big problem but a bit annoying.

Good things. I like the set up rules quite a bit, will create a lot of variety in the game play. I also like the somewhat tactical feel. We didn't really grind the turn order but it could be used to really leverage one's position. There is a bit of a chicken gaming going on.

I had fun with it and would like to play it again. Our first play took about 4-4.5 hours including rules explanation with all players being new to the game.

No idea how a game about national economics can be this fun, but it sure is.
The addition of a "trade value" (the difference between buying and selling) makes for a more transparent trading, alleviating the problems of many other trading games.

RATING: 6
Excellent game of commodity production/selling/trading. I love the no-luck rules and the way the commodity boards easily show the players the current fair trade value of any commodity, which helps keep calculation time down. Make sure you download V2 rules here on BGG. The V1 game is good, but V2 has a few tweaks that help cut down on gametime without cutting any meat of the game. Have only played with 3 and 4.

Nice looking game. With a few tweaks it could jump a point.

This rating has nothing to do with the design, which seems like a fine heavy economic design.

The game mechanics reward players for bargaining to get the best price they can on every single deal.  So trading slows to a snails pace and drags the game out to ad nauseum.  We played with the expansion which I'm almost sure was broken.  Because I had resorted to consuming large quantities of beer to self medicate the massive lethargy induced by playing this game, I will give it a pass on being broken for now.

I wish this one wasn't quite so long.  The game may be a little to dry and long for what it is, but I do enjoy it.

I do think I understand the suggestion within the game that all trades be made at the middle point.  The one game I played (even though I explained the mid point 'suggestion') someone insisted on trying to negotiate the entire time, which drug the game down.

It is clever and clean, I'll give it that. The board, I think, is largely superfluous in that someone might get hosed semi-arbitrarily, but since I don't like spatial puzzles of this sort perhaps I'm biased.
My biggest problem is the pacing. For one thing, you spend a lot of time doing very small transactions (i.e., buy one cube), which can make some turns drag. Further, it seems like the winner can easily be decided early on in a 3+ hour game. With absolutely no catch-up mechanic, and instead compounding economies of scale, that is not cool.

We really had fun with this one with the 6 players.  And we look forward to the next effort.  Some might find this a complex game but we all quickly got the hang of it and are already starting to plot new strategies for it.  I think it's a rather simple game to learn, but a difficult one to master.  And with 6 players at once it really forces you to think out your trades, how they benefit you, and how it benefits them.  Nice effect with the market, we all felt it's going to be a really different result when it comes to another 6 player attempt at this one.

RATING: 5
Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc econòmic, on es tracta de produir diferents tipus de bens i fer accions de compra/venta en un mercat per guanyar més diners que la resta. Guanya el jugador que hagi aconseguit lucrarse més comptant fàbriques construides i riquesa.

El sistema de mercat sembla molt àgil i el joc té molt bona pinta com a joc d'especulació de bens. Hi ha negociació entre jugadors.

El sistema de construcció de fábriques sembla molt abstracte, i la mecànica en general pot resultar repetitiva. Sense haver jugat, em sembla que el joc no deixa de ser simplement una mecànica de mercat sense res més, i això pot ser un problema (per la rejugabilitat i el "pilot automàtic" durant la partida), tot i que funcioni molt bé.

M'agradaria poder provar-lo...

Speculation with a working market system.  Expect downtime during the Trade phase as players buy, sell and trade goods.

RATING: 8
I was impressed by the rather sophisticated economics and market system of this game. However, the economic and power structures of hypothetical nations were represented by various dots of various colors on large hex counters. The structures could be expanded by strategic placement of additional hexes of the same type, yielding more stuff: power, money, influence, etc. It is an interesting, highly abstracted representation of how nations economically grow. I could be talked into it someday. For now, it is a '6'.

Update (06/15/12): 3+ years later, and I didn't need to be talked into it; someone brought it, we played it, and it was a blast. After playing many heavier weight economic games, this second go-around is more familiar, with the usual Euro "resources beget buildings beget more resources" sequence. However, unlike some other Euros, the players build in a shared area, with elements of area control and geometric alignment. Players claim space first, and then build specific structures requiring a specific assortment of resources, just like Settlers. What really shines about this game is the market mechanism, with prices fluctuating due to supply and demand. I finally "get it". The 2nd edition rules and more liberal starting packages make for much more rapid development and expansive play. I'm raising it to an '8'.

I liked the tile laying and sorta-abstract nature of things. I always feel like that gives a game more scope for balance and playability than trying to adhere to some real world scenario.

But the game took forever. The trading part seemed ridiculously long. I've also been convinced that the way loans work is fairly broken. If someone understands that and has a good idea of their future costs (i.e. giving experienced players a huge advantage) they'll take out a ton of loans on the first turn and leverage themselves into a better future position.

A fabulous game of trading, resource production and infrastructure building.  Five resources are differentiated in price by markets which respond to the supply and demand created between the players which, in turn, is a result of the players' infrastructure choices.  An ingenious tile-based mechanic controls the relative supply of each resource, and to score highly a player will have to adapt their infrastructure to produce the goods for which there is most demand.

My rating is based on one game with four players.  There is a lot going on in this game, with several options each turn.  I've read comments from others about the trading phase really bogging things down late in the game and can see how that could happen.  I doubt I would want to play with more than four players for just that reason.  All in all, a few simple rules work to produce a game with a lot of tension and many different options each turn.

A dry and highly calculational exercise in engine building. This game is a pure snowball so if you miscalculate by so much as one cube in the early rounds you'll effectively put yourself out of contention and that's really not acceptable in a 2+ hour long game. There's also the minor question of how much you're allowed to expand by neighbouring empires (and the board doesn't scale for different numbers of players). I'm all for challenge in games, but this is perhaps a bit too challenging and might have worked better on computer.

RATING: N/A
Good game with lots going on and an intricate interplay between players.  It may seem easy, but there's lots to think about.  However, don't bother trying to weigh up every deal down to the last dollar - it isn't worth it and the final result isn't affected that much by the odd dollar here or there.  If the deal is good for you, go for it.

I'd always play that every Promissary Note held at the end of the Production Phase must pay interest of $1 to the bank to make loans more realistic and give more incentive to repay an early loan.  Also, I'd allow players to trade anything in the game, including flags and industry tiles.  This is business and in business everything has a price.

It's not like Power Grid and the theme isn't strongly implemented.  However, it's all about getting the resources you need to further your position - and other players will have cheaper resources than the open market.  As such, it's a good economics game where supply and demand change the prices with every trade.

If you like Acquire, then this is a similar game.

Sep08: It is what it is.  A multi-market economic simulation.  There are 5 commodities with their own markets and you each can produce those same commodities.

It's not the greatest just due to play time.  Your main decisions are:

1. How much debt.
2. What industries to buy.
3. How to squeeze onto the board.

But those decisions aren't enough to carry the 2+ hour play time.  We just went with an open trading phase for the most part to speed things up.  We also went with an almost open purchase phase.  Even then we still pushed 2 hours.  Oiy.  Stick to Brass.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2017)

I recently bought Wealth of Nations. It was very expensive, furthermore, if you have into account the game´s components (low quality in many aspects) but the game is from 2008 and it is out of print. I would have LOVED this game a couple of years ago, but I have changed a lot in these years and, although I enjoyed the game, I prefer to play many other games over Wealth of Nations.

The rules seem complex, but they are deceptively easy. You can explain them under 9 minutes. It comes with great player aids (printed on paper). Playtime can be over three hours, which is too long for this kind of game.

The game´s components are low quality in general. The tiles and bits are thin, the aids are printed on paper and they wrinkle easy, it has paper money, the flags that distinguish the players are small and thin. It is hard to see what players own from across the table. The central board is small. The market boards are good though. 

Just after reading the rules I was very keen to play the game, on paper it looks great.

Wealth of Nations is almost theme-less.

The game´s decisions aren’t obvious, in fact they are interesting through all the game. The game has only 3 phases in each turn. First comes the trade phase in which you buy and sell resources you will need. You can trade with other players if it is you turn and, although fun, this part takes a long time to play. A couple of years ago I wouldn’t mind much about this downtime, but now I do. The game itself has a recommended bartering price, but still this phase is very slow for me. I think this is what keep me from rating it higher. Second, is the Development phase in which you claim terrain by placing your flag and you build and automate industries, this phase is fun to play and it doesn’t take much time. The last phase is the Produce Phase which plays very quick as all players play simultaneously. As I wrote before, the rules are easy to get, but the choices of when to build and what to build aren’t easy.

I’m not sure the game is 100% fair to players in the setup, the packages don’t feel balanced, but I would need more plays to verify. As it stands, I feel the first players have an advantage which would be very unfair in a long and deep game.

In the game, you are a generic nation, I was expecting every nation to play differently, but all nations are exactly the same. This is a minor issue for me.

I think the game would play very well with 6 players, but then the downtime would be too much for me. I prefer to play it as a 4 player game.

Wealth of Nations is a long game with zero luck after the setup. I really like this aspect of the game, however, for a game this long, it seems very hard to stop a runaway leader, that is, the game seems decided in the first half of the game, but you have to finish it anyway. I’m not sure if this is the case at all, it is more of a feeling I have after one play. I need more plays to verify.

Bottom line, Wealth of Nations is a medium weight game with lots of interesting decisions and zero luck after the setup. It is a novel and unique design. I should love it but the slow trading phase kills it for me. It (perhaps) have some issues along the lines of “the rich get richer” but I need more games to verify this part. I already sold the game but I would gladly play it again if requested. I sold it because I prefer to play many games over this one and I´m trying to shrink my game collection to a manageable level. Just the day I was going to play it, I found there are some new rules from an expansion. I didn’t try them.

Wonderful trading/economic game, two of my favorite genres rolled into one. Seems to have excellent potential replayability because of the highly variable nature of board play. The trading mechanic provides a consistently high degree of interaction and interest from all players in every trade. The intensely interactive nature of trade makes the game a real delight, but also likely ensures that it rarely will clock in at much less than 3 hours. The oversize industry tiles and large market mats also demand a good deal of table space, so WoN may not be a great candidate for play in public meeting spaces such as bookstores or cafes. Small quibble, but there really needs to be a token to denote the current active player during trading. Given all the discussion that occurs during trading, it can be difficult to recall which of the two players completing a trade was taking his turn at the time. Nevertheless, a very good effort that rewards the time spent playing.

OUCH!! After one play this is probably the most brain burner game I have ever played to date.  Even though I think very highly of this game I would not want to play it with more than 4 players, more than that would just bog this game down.  I have heard complaints that the barting part of the game slows it down, this didn't hurt our game at all being that we followed the bartering guidelines set forth by the different markets.  One of my favorites.

This game has intriguing ideas but it is in great need of variants to streamline gameplay. The trading round is ridiculously slow in my opinion, even for the 3 player game that I was in. I would not play again unless someone develops a streamlined version. I also dislike haggling so I would prefer to trade with take it or leave it set prices.

Actually not a bad game! I had read the rules previous and found the bartering mechanic allowed for a very slow game but found that if you just go by the median that is posted for the current rate it makes things go much smoother. Sure you can go crazy but whats the point in that - it's a game. Plain and simple. I will be picking this up.

Could be excellent but isnt.  Alot about the game I liked but the play length particularly the uninspiring trade phase puts me off wanting to get this back to the table.  (We agreed to end the game early after 3 hours (5 players and I suspect there was probably about another 1.5 hours to go).

Interesting economic game 
I'm not sure about the zero luck factor as I think there is an advantage in going first and second. they get to pick the industry tiles and start the game giving them more options in expanding. Since the game doesn't have a number of rounds that can be divided by the number of players and the number of rounds is limited there is an advantage to them.

Check out the latest version of the rules as the designer is constantly trying to improve on this good game.



the first game I completely messed up by paying loans back to quickly and not expanding my white goods economy first. I paid the loans back so quickly because I had to pay for them each round. Without that it wouldn't have thought about that. 


I took a lot of loans in the beginning but because I was  getting rid of them soon i needed to loan again. 
Still Micheal and Jeroen played a superior game. Perhaps Bianca could have forced the end herself allthough she needed to invest in industries then.Perhaps by forcing she would loose one or 2 VP. The others would have lost more.

Now that I have a clear idea how the game works I'm pretty sure I can score close to a 100.


Update : february 2011
Playing this with three newbies the playing time after rules explanation certainly doubles if not more...

This is a very mathy game.
Despite of the downtime I'll upgrade my ranking (something I rarely do) to 7.5
And in the future I can only see this rising. I own planet steam and that could be a serious contender to this game.
And after completing I have to say my friends and I really enjoyed our play. I'll subtract .1 of the score for its length. If only it took way less  time it would definately be a favourite.

What a dryness!!! I think this is a first time ever, when I'm thinking that on your turn you can do too little -> I mean that your steps are so tiny, that it takes a way too many turns before you've got all the elements you needed to go to the next step. And if you play this with negotiation element the game length will explode! Wealth of Nations is one of those games, where "all-the-information-is-visible-and-it-kills-all-the-excitement".

Either I don't fully grasp the small, baby economic steps it takes to play this game or it just doesn't do it for me.  However, I really like Planet Steam.  Plenty of long games that I really enjoy but WoN is about 2 hours too long for what I like about it (which is why I prefer Planet Steam).  The ideas are neat but it just plods along too slowly with too many micro-steps for my tastes.  You take 3 steps forward to take 4 steps back and then take 2 steps forward.  Net effect, you've move 1 step forward in a hand full of turns??  If this was more streamlined, or two hours shorter, then I think I might like it.  WoN also drags on the negotiation aspect (even though it's a nice mechanism).

A fantastic economic game with a precarious balance between spending, production, and speculation. The markets keep the players informed and prices in check.

This game looks awesome--like Catan for anal-retentive types such as myself. Can't wait to get it on the table!

Update 11/30/10: Exceeded expectations! A game where it can be very difficult to figure out who's winning (and thus it is hard to despair over board position), with great marketplace confrontation, with the best trading rules I have ever seen, with an excellent catch-up mechanic, and a brilliant method of mitigating the effects of A.P. 

This game is everything a Euro should be. The only (only!) reason why it doesn't get 9.5/10 is that it is not an accessible game to non-gamers. HOWEVER, it is worth working toward. I started my group on Catan six months ago. Now they're champing at the bit for harder fare.

It's a long, heavy economic-industrial game.

It has some problems with the end game (It can feel a bit dragged out, it goes on for about 1 or 2 turns too many.)

It sometimes feels that you have to get lucky in producing the right thing at the beginning, but I like it anyway. Mainly because I love the market system (Which is completely player driven.)

The rules as written make this game take too long.  The trading phase needs to be open trading and timed.  Otherwise it takes far too long.  I have developed slightly different rules in order to keep the game moving so it finishes in under 3 hours.

Heavy economic, buying/selling resources. 
A little long on play time (2hrs.), but the dynamic (based on a video review by Tom Vasel) seems to be very inviting.

The economic aspect (buy and sell) is nice and how the board is built (hex and circles) is intriguing.

Like the Supply vs Demand aspect,  appeals to the Econ-geek in me.

The Trade phase can go a little long unless players are able to plan ahead.

People seemed to get tripped up by the "definitions" of Price vs Value vs Worth.  There are no absolutes here, plan accordingly.

Recommend using the V.2 rules (w/o conflict).  Speeds up the game immensely.

8: My favorite economic game. The way that supply and demand actually works in the game is quite brilliant; the markets accurately reflect the value of the various goods. The game is about leveraging these goods to enable you to cover the most area and at the same time make you the most money. It's a very challenging game so don't play when your brain is tired!

A very interesting game design.  It takes a long time to play though, and can be dry.  Because of that, I'm wary of introducing it to new groups or getting it to the table more often.  I enjoy it, but I don't want to get it to the table too often.  And when I do feel like an economic game, this often loses out to Indonesia or Container.

Played with 3 players. It just felt like a much better game. I would not mind playing more with 3, maybe 4. Not more than that.

Played again with 3 and v 2.0 rules. The changer really speed up the game (I think it is the new packages)

Played a game with 5 players and V 2.0. It took 2 hours, which is reasonable, but felt a little too long. Still rather play with 3 or 4 but with the v2 rules 5 is a viable choice.

This is a clever game of small margin advantages and building efficient production structures.  Is it fun?  Well, if you like a tight economy where every move is important and you are not overly afflicted with the disease of analysis paralysis, I think you will enjoy it.  Great for two players if you each take 4 packages.  Three players and four players really tighten the board up.  Five players is really tough on the board.

well it was an alright game.. but what bugged me was if I wanted to sell something it would take forever to wait between turns because you can only buy or sell 1 thing per turn.. instead of a ton at once. kind of annoying. 

i'm not sure if i'll ever play it again.

This game is hard for me to rate after 1 play.  It a deep economic game.  I like that.  There's quite a bit to think about.  I like that.  It's brutal, which is generally not a problem... but this one can be very unforgiving.  I was enjoying it until I forgot I needed a white cube for automation.  I was doing quite well.  I lost production for a turn because of that and that devastated me.  I went from challenging for the lead to finishing 1 point from last.  Ouch.

I will give it a tentative 7. I think it will move up or down with subsequent plays.

RATING: 6.5
A strong some-what heavy and some-what abstract economics game.  Players use their commodities/resources to stake out land (board play is very important), build various industries on their land or produce from those industries (generally requires food and energy).  Additionally, players can trade commodities to other players, buy them from the market or sell them to the market (thus effecting the market).  There's certainly some potential depth in the market play although I didn't see too much in a 3-player game.  The group you're playing with will have a lot to do with how exciting the game is.  Without the market manipulation it's fairly dry and there's not much new here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is abstract, no doubt about it. I'm selling and buying red cubes, white cubes, blue cubes, etc, in order to produce blue tiles, yellow tiles, etc, which in turn give me more of those cubes. 

Played this with V2 rules. IMO, this game MUST be played with these rules.

The goal of this game is to build up tiles but what this game is really about is the trade phase, which is where ties are loosened, sweat springs up on brows, and mouths open. 

What this game does is give us a market, and the market is amazing. If you don't respect the market, it will crush you. Prices will soar and you're going to find yourself nabbing promissory notes. Somehow, though you have a nice assortment of cubes, it doesn't feel like you can sell them back for a profit. You need those blue cubes to power your bloc (generate your product, which you will use to get more money) but they never seem important until it's too late and you realize you don't have enough money to buy them. There are 5 different markets, outside of the financial one, and you need cubes from all of them. But those black capital cubes are so darned expensive.....

This game was a hit with my whole group of varied interests (some of whom are artsy and hate math). They like it for two reasons: all info is open and extremely well balanced, and there is tons of player interaction. People liked buying and selling from/to each other. People liked the dynamic market, which reflected the actions of the group as a whole, rather than any individual. They liked the balance and the simple rules that lead to a very smart game.

I'd say this game is the game to introduce to your friends who love Monopoly. They'll never look back. 

*Update after 3 games* Yesterday I introduced this game to 2 new players, one of which I knew wouldn't be a problem but the other being a guy who is emphatic that Monopoly was a great wheeling/dealing game, and Monopoly Deal improved on it by making the game quick (though after months of playing, he came around and agreed with me that the game is largely luck-based).

Here's what's so great about the game: I was playing with two "veterans" (it being our 3rd game) and 2 newbs. It helps that the veterans (including one History major who is self-described "bad at math") kept saying to every remark that it's a really good game.

The setup is fiddly, putting all the cubes in their slots. Then you do the Starting Packages phase after a cursory rules explanation. There's a lot of overwhelming cube info on the player mats. There were people around, including those who have seen us played this game before, never played it, yet go "This boring game again?" Lots of distractions as people talk all around us. The first trade/develop/produce phase I almost felt like giving up, having to keep people's attention to the board and notify them that it was their turn. Of course, it takes a very long time to play this, ESPECIALLY with newbs when they keep asking "why do I need red cubes again?" "When is the Produce Phase?". Not that I mind, questions about the game mean interest in the game! However, it also means AP galore. 

But we stuck to it, and by the middle of the second trade phase, the game's appeal once again won out. We were haggling, wheeling, dealing, enjoying ourselves like crazy. I thought this third game was going to be the one where I'd have a bad game but I was dead wrong. Mr. Monopoly even asked me where he can get his own copy afterwards. I have yet to play this where even one player dislikes it. 

I give this game one point off for it's length. We've never actually gotten past 3 Produce Phases. But as all my regular group have now played it (and Mr. Monopoly is converted), games should move a bit more from now on. I look forward to many future play-sessions!

*edit Dec 2012* Excellent game but too damned long! I think I'll be getting rid of this one, it's too impractical to play. One of my favorites but I can't afford the 5 hour playtime!

Interesting game.  I won my first play against Tim, Tim, Jason, and Matt.  Cons: you kind of get locked into whatever color you start with.  You have to go into debt at the beginning to keep up (I did 3 promisary notes), so maybe they should start you off with more money.  Give everyone 60 or 80 more dollars to start with, because everyone is going to get a couple promisary notes right off the bat anyway.  Tiles seem unneccesarily tough to lay out, they force everyone to quickly get in each others ways.  And red does seem to force the speed of the game in some ways.

1 play: I enjoy this game, it is very engaging and the long play time didn't bother me.  However, I find farms useless past mid-game and Capital a very strong and potentially game winning commodity to be in.

I do enjoy that fact that it is near impossible to be self sufficient, and keeping your suppliers happy will be an important factor.

This is a 2 hour economics game where you buy labor, food, automation, and other resources in order to build factories and generate income/resources.

The key is that there is a board for each resource that fluctuates based on what is bought/sold throughout the game. The relative gain/loss for each cube is known and can increase/decrease based on what other people do, but it is NOT determined by dice roll, rather by a known scale which slides up/down based on purchases/sales.

This looks like a pretty good game, but it will be longer/heavier than usual.

Well, if you're into turning money into cubes and cubes into points then this is the game for you. The trading phase is slow as molasses because unless you get cubes via barter from other players you have to buy them one at a time--I kid you not. Even worse, at game end, you do a final trade phase to turn your cubes into points--at this point you may well have several dozen--and this occurs in the same cube-by-cube order. (It's not a game like Navegador where the prices for a bulk sale are determined by wherever you are in the market--nope, each cube's price is calculated separately, and is affected by the actions of other players between each sale. The rulebook recommends you pull out pencil and paper at this point :S ....)

Basically: a headachy game. Main good point is that the market boards have little wells in them, which makes cube-wrangling much more manageable than in Terraforming Mars.

In Wealth of Nations, there are six commodities that are produced, bought and sold.: 1 Food, produced from farms. 2. Energy, produced form generators. 3. Labour, produced by academies. 4. Mines, produced from ores, 5. Capital, produced from factories, and 6. Money, produced from banks. The game board is made of hexes, where players reserve hexes, then build an industry type on those hexes. 

Each game turn has three phases. In the first phase, is the trading phase, where you can buy or sell one unit of commodity, or trade with your fellow players. Each commodity has a certain buy and price value. For instance, at the beginning of the game, ore costs $20 to buy and $15 to sell, whlle food costs $6 to by and $4 to sell. Note that the market will fluctuate depending on the demand, so the scarcer an item, the more expensive it becomes. In this phase, one may borrow promissory notes. The first note gives the borrower $20, the second notes gives $19 and so on. Each promissory note may be paid off for $25, and unpaid promissory notes at the end of the game subtract 3 VPs from the player. 

The second phase is the develop phase. In this phase, a player may mark a hex on their board for expansion, by paying a labour, and putting their flag marker on their spot. A player can only expand adjacent to an industry tile of their own. Players may also pay goods to get an industry tile and place on one of their flags. For instance, a farm tile costs one ore and one capital, while a bank tile cost one energy, ore and capital. There are restrictions with placing industry tiles, such as a producing side cannot connect to another producing side of a different tile, but this can be overcome by playing one capital. Other options available in this phase, include 1) paying a capital and having the ability to parachute three industry tiles anywhere they like, 2) automating a bloc (tiles of the same industry, e.g., three adjacent farm tiles) by paying an energy, and two capital.

The last phase is the produce phase. For each bloc that a player provides an energy, and one food per tile, the bloc will produce goods. Farms do not require food, and generators do not need energy. The game ends when someone has all 18 flags on their board or five out of the six industry tiles have run out. Players sell their goods on the market, one good at a time. Every $10 is worth a VP, and each tile is worth 4 VPs. Unpaid promissory notes are minus 3 VPs each. 

I have only played this once, but it was a 4 hr long game, much longer than I wanted since I was out of it, and everyone else had used promissory notes, while I did not. The mechanics are simple, but the trading bogs down for me a bit. I also don't like the tactical aspects where someone could get cut off from expanding.

Nail-biting economics, Power Griddish engine building, and fast-paced negotiation, all in one brain-blasting, luck-free, incredibly cool game.  I'm in love with this puppy.  It's great cause for celebration for fans of negotiation games and heavier Euros.  If you get tired of the game dragging on and on due to excessive haggling, you're playing with the wrong people.

After a few plays, I think this might be too long for what it is. It's a decent market sim type game, but since at its core it's really just market and trading, it feels somewhat empty for how long it is. I have a feeling that after a few more plays, even though it'll probably get shorter, optimal strategies will pop up and there will be less variation from game to game. I almost get a feeling that I should be playing Chinatown instead, for that better trading mechanism.

The market feels like it should be part of a game, not the whole game like it is here.

Blimey, what a brain burner!! This is definitely not one for the casual gamer... you need to be ready to work your braincells with this. That said, if you can get through it, the game actually seems pretty good. My only concern is that it's one I'm unlikely to get to play often enough to actually come close to being any good at it!! My rating is based on the fact that I liked the game, rather than on the fact I'm unlikely to play it much.

A dry economic game of building factories to produce goods, which are then used to build more factories to produce more goods, finishing when the map is filled in. The problem you face is that you need nearly all the different goods either to build (which is settlers style, this+this+this gets you that) or to run the factories, but you can never produce all the different goods you need. Your turns are therefore spent trading, trading, trading, or selling/buying/selling/buying/... from the market until you get what you need. It gets repetitive over the long haul. It's interesting how the player decisions on what to invest in, and the choices on generalising vs specialising, drives the market prices and ongoing player behaviour, but not enough to save it compared to today's fodder. I'm looking forward to trying the War Clouds expansion however in the advised expectation of improvement.

RATING: 5
Un gioco a due facce. Ha un motore economico molto interessante che riproduce molto fedelmente il sistema di domanda/offerta, e ti dà la sensazione che ci siano più strategie per arrivare alla vittoria. Poi la grafica è molto ben curata (con uno stile che richiama la propaganda sovietica) e funzionale: mi piacciono in particolare i cinque mercati attorno al tabellone. Le fasi di gioco sono semplici e offrono la possibilità di fare strategie complesse: in particolare la fase di commercio, nella quale si può passare il proprio turno per "stare alla finestra" e rientrare quando tutti hanno bisogno della tua roba. 

Però gli stessi vantaggi mi lasciano interdetto: è estremamente asciutto, con nessuna concessione al tema. Mi stupisce lo sforzo di creare nazioni fittizie quando nel tabellone non c'è neanche una cosa che si potrebbe definire mappa. La grafica è bella, ma per un gioco astratto: le tessere a pois con le "industrie" sono quasi offensive... va bene che è apprezzabile mostrare che le fattorie si espandono con un pattern diverso dalle banche, ma ci vuole uno sforzo in più, cribbio! La regola del passare il turno per rientrare più tardi ammazza letteralmente il gioco, che in sei giocatori diventa un estenuante e lentissimo girotondo della morte (specialmente con giocatori distratti o pensatori): questa lentezza trascina la partita ben oltre le due ore indicate sulla scatola (ma forse in quattro giocatori scala meglio). 

Non è un gioco, è una notevolissima meccanica.

RATING: 10
This is my candidate for the most under-appreciated game on the geek. The way it plays so differently from game to game depending on what each player decides to produce is fascinating. In our previous games obtaining food at a reasonable price had not been an issue but in our last game the player who had invested heavily at the beginning to get a bank up and running found that he basically had to use all of his $90 return each round to buy food to allow him to produce.

RATING: 2
Completely abstract, it offers no feeling of running a state economy.  The lack of any transportation network, national borders, or other geographical elements creates this disconnected from any real economy feeling.

In addition, Wealth of Nations plays at an excruciatingly slow pace, with endless rounds of petty trading.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Supply-and-demand-based economic games are not too common in the board game world, but Wealth of Nations fills that niche pretty well.  The basic choice in the game is whether you want to invest in high-end facilities and have control over many of the transactions in the game, or lower-end facilities with which its easier to score points, but might give you less in-game control.  The game very much encourages specialization, and trading with other players to get resources you don't have.  Additionally, there's a spatial element to the game, which limits how various facilities can be placed, as well as allows for the blocking of other players.  As for things I didn't enjoy about the game, I thought the player-to-player trading made the game very slow at times, and the one-by-one interaction with the bank was tedious.

The abstract area control seems like a really weird mix with the economic engine-creation.  The area control bit can be brutal and really ruin your plans if you are unlucky enough to get pinched between players intent on aggressive expansion.

It seems like you also want to do some M. Wallace-esque measured early debt if you want to succeed.

It has the potential to be a very long, grinding game of gaining inches.  It may have the potential to also be a fun economic game, but I'm not sure yet.

When some spectator looked at our game and compared it with Settlers of Catan we all had a laugh, but near the end of the game it certainly felt this game had the same problem as Settlers of Catan with 4 players: 1 player will be cut off from further expansion and is screwed for the rest of the game.

Other complaints about this game: playing time is too long and why couldn't they found an eleganter way to end the game that everbody has to sell his cubes 1 at a time? And why the hell do you wanna play this game with  more then 3???

There is a descent game in here somewhere, I'm not sure we'll play this again to find it. The trade phase is excruciating in length, bogs down the playing time and sucks the fun right out of it. The idea of an economics game is solid but just like in Container, it fails in its execution. Everyone who trades for cubes wants a fair deal and goes by the suggested trading values. Sometimes people barter back and forth haggling over a dollar. Monopolies are hard to maintain in a 6 player game and thus the price cannot be manipulated as much as it should be. I tried being the only supplier of energy and hoarding the cubes to drive up the price but was woefully unsuccessful. We played for 4 hours and finally called it quits before finishing, just so we would have time to play a good game before the end of the night.

Having played twice and read all the commentary to date, the promissory note portion of the design brings the games rating down. Will try a few games using a variant where outstanding notes cost an extra $1 per turn payable at the beginning of the round. This should put some pressure on how quickly one goes deep in debt to prevent the board from playing out on the first turn (not much to do there after 10 notes and flagging the board down on turn one).

Played a few times with the $1/note/turn variant and it works for me - keeps the rating from falling

On first play, I can see the potential for a huge variety of different ways the game can be played out.

Very nice economic core to the game, with many different strategies possible from territory expansion, diversifying into other industries, building economy of scale, blocking tactics, movement of industries to other locations, loans and bartering.  And a constant need to adjust plans according to what other players are doing.

Played with version 1 of the rules, and I want to play this again soon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the better economic games.
Everything has value, and everything has costs associated - laying out your claims, tiles (plants), production. 
The plants have economies of scale an extra hex will add more than one output. Since it generally takes 2 items to produce anything multiple hexes are close to mandatory.
Claim and tile placements can lock out your opponents from lucrative locations or cost them more to build their plants.
You have to weigh what it costs to run your plants versus what you get, you have to weight what you spend to place tiles versus potential production and the victory points at the end of the game versus retaining the money for victory points. Yes you want to drive the price of items up, but too much you encourage other players to build those kind of plants. 
Do you diversify and not get an economy of scale, or do you focus on one industry to see if you can manipulate its price...
 
You can see there are lot of decision points you have weigh at each phase of the game. 
The round robin taking only one action does keep the players involved throughout most of the turn. 

Recommend some of the revisions from new version - turn based interest payments to make keeping loans less lucrative. The revised end sale and buying/selling 3 items at a time from the market speeds up the game.

I described this game to a friend as a cross between Power Grid, Settlers, and Acquire and I stand by the comparison.  I think it takes some of the best aspects of each of these games: money management from Power Grid, trading from Settlers, and Territory Grab/Monopolization from Aquire.  The game can get frustrating if one player has a clear advantage since there is little you can do to stop them aside from wasting your own resources to block them.  I think this game would probably increase in fun value as the player number increases.  I've only played with 3-4 players and would love the chance to play with 5-6 players.

OK, so I bought it. I do like it, but it does take a bit longer to play than I'd like. I have to get a few people to play this a couple of times with me to see how much quicker it can go. I also want to play it with other than 4 players, to see if the player position advantage goes away.

This game is a very stripped down, abstract and dry economic game. Tile placement is interesting, as is the market, but the trading phase is... unwieldy- to be generous. This game took about 2 hours too long to play. It has some interesting points, but also has some odd design choices that seem like poorly thought out fixes. Overall, it just dragged on and on; often it was more of a chore than fun to play.

It'll be interesting to see whether it winds up being too long for my group, but I thought this was a very good economic/trading game.  I was quite impressed with the design of the tiles, which added a heck of a lot of interest to the board play.  Very, VERY nice demo set that these guys use for convention demos, too.  Solid!

Also, for those saying there's no direct player interaction on the board, consider some of the possibilities for aggressive placement of tiles and flags and, maybe even nastier than that, the ability to move blocs of industry tiles.  I thought there was plenty of interactivity!

UPDATE: Several years on, I still really, really like this game.  The version 2 streamlining is excellent, I think, and I wish I could get it played once a month so we can get much quicker at it.

UPDATE: Another good session.  I'm terrible at the game -- the winner nearly doubled my score after starting with three sets of industry to my one -- but I enjoy it every time.  I think I'll be able to get this out with some frequency.

One of my favorite economic games, after Imperial.  While I enjoy the market dynamics at the core of the game, what is often overlooked is the trading.  With more players (5-6), there can be a lot of wheeling and dealing, since cubes, money, and promissory notes, and even unbinding offers of future tile selection/placement, can be part of the deals.  My favorite part of Settlers is the trading and there are few games that do it well (Genoa for example just goes overboard with what you can offer).  Wealth has just the right balance, giving you clear structure of what the trading price should be at the moment, but then room to negotiate around that if you want.  

There can be a lot of screwage on the board, which seems to the main complaint of the game (along with game length), but that's just part of the game - it forces you to be flexible and change your plans more so than say Power Grid, where blocking usually just comes down to having to spend a little more money whereas blocking in Wealth can force you to replan your whole strategy into a different color or tile arrangement.  My only real complaint is that it is a very abstract game in its visual design - it's one of the few games where I feel a pasted-on theme might do it some good. For example, the tiles could have some art, with the partial circles being images of factories, academies, farms, and banks, that fit together.

--Jul2008-- Superficially pretty cool economic engine & trading game.  On further reflection it seems that there are some strange dynamics here too:  there's no point not taking all one's loans immediately (since there's no interest payments).  Things then seem to become a race to constrain the market.  I believe a bit more development could have made this a lot stronger.

This game is too long and repetitive. It could easily be cut in half in all areas: half the board, half the commodity markets, half time. Then it might make sense. Now it is just deciding what you want to do. Then spend 20 minutes buying and trading the components (no worry for money since you can always take a loan). You end up with 10-15 cubes with which to complete your actions. Then you perform the actions and if you counted cubes wrong you are basically f**ked. No skill involved and low on excitement.

Abstract development game with nations and economies represented by hexes, dots and cubes.

Because I did vastly better at my second game having learnt valuable lessons from my first, I can say that I like this. It appears that the game is prone to runaway leaders, but interestingly our first game was dominated by bankers, whereas in the second they barely paid back the setup investment. If players or indeed a single player do not pay attention to what others are doing and where the demand is in the economy, the sitaution can be ruthlessly exploited by others. 

On the whole I think I would prefer to play some other economic game, but this has its merits. Doubt it would be improved by takeovers and conflict.

Anyhow, I've only played once with six players, and the game felt very long.  In fact, we couldn't end it, cause we had to go.  The low rating is for the feelings that I got in that single game, in which we had a lot of downtime and waiting.  Nevertheless, I'm sure that with fewer players this game will shine; maybe three, but certainly no more than four.  I´m looking forward to give it a try with that many.  By the way, the theme just don't fit.  Better look at it as a business game in which holdings try to expand.

Didn't finish playing this, but it was great fun throughout. Very interesting decisions came up all the time, often with consequences which you never expected or prepared for. I'd play this game by setting objectives at the start of each turn, trying to meet them, and postponing them to the next turn if it's worth it (e.g. taking a loan right now vs. producing it myself next turn), and if I won't be negatively affected by what other players are doing. Always watch and carefully manipulate the market, especially in the good you specialize in. Very, very interesting. Note economics student bias. Bought this in spite of crappy components because of economics. 

...and traded it away, because I don't think I can get 4-6 players to fork out 4 hours of their time over very abstract game pieces. The trading/negotiation phase can also seriously bog down. The terrible game flow (trading phase and last turn) suggests that this game was not playtested and streamlined enough.

There is a core of a great economic game here.  Unfortunately, my one play of it dragged on way too long.  The new, updated rules look like they will streamline things quite a bit, so I'm looking forward to giving it another try with those.

Update: I've played with the new rules and it did improve many things.  Most importantly, it played much, much faster.  Can't quite rate it an 8 yet, but maybe with a few more plays.

The only thing I felt was missing was direct player conflict.  During the play test the designers decided to remove the only direct conflict element from the game.  With that included I'd easily rate this an 8.  On the plus side the interplayer trade element is fantastic.  You must trade to win and you must trade smart.  And as everybody is aware of that fact it makes it all the more difficult.

I'm not rating it yet, but after one 5p game, I declare that it is an overlong, repetitive, very abstract game.  Nonetheless, it does have a developmental arc.  I like heavy economic games, but I'm not sure that this appeals.  The (very necessary) "go around the table taking one action until everyone passes" in the Trade phase can drag on and on.  The game could have been streamlined somewhat by reducing the purchase "price" of industries or of activating your industries.  I'm willing to admit that poor strategy and having no concept of the timing arc of the game would both contribute to reducing my enjoyment of this game.  Thus, I will play this again to verify my impressions.

RATING: 6
Very cool economic game.  Lots of interdependencies require that the players have to trade amongst each other to continue moving their economies forward.  Playing this is a fun, if quite involved, gaming experience.

UPDATE: Finally got back to the table again. I don't know if the players were just really involved in trying to trade or what, but the trading took so long. As a result, like most trading games, they are way too long for what they should be - trading needs to have fixed parameters. I think you really have to tell the players that they need to stick to the assigned bartering values.

It's certainly an economic game, with a clever cube generation system related to positional play on the board. But where are the nations? The game is too abstract for me: all I was really doing was converting cubes into money to buy other cubes, so I could play some tiles. I'd also prefer some bit of randomness in the game. It's kind of fun, but I also wish it played more quickly -- just too long for such an abstract exercise.

RATING: 7
I like the exercise in planning and reacting to the different markets.  The market mechanism works really well, and the circles-on-tiles is a very clever way to introduce economies of scale in the different industries.  You have to decide when to keep building your starting industries (because of the increased rate of return for you) and when to invest in a new commodity (usually when one is getting short/expensive).  I also like the art design.  It does play pretty slowly though (about 3 hrs for 4 players).

Fascinating: the prices of all commodities sunked except for energy, the one I needed most. The game was won by Joan after expanding with food, Warrior being close behind (he had a very restricted space but managed to have banks). I lost in a quixotic attempt to al so develop banking.

Rating based upon relatively few plays.  I like this game, it plays fine, but a little too slowly for my tastes.  It seems like you have a ton of data to compile and make decisions. I fear the final decisions I make mya not have be as important as they feel. I also fear that the game can be solved. I'm going to enjoy this while I can, and will revist my rating if I need to.

Wealth of Nations is staggeringly ponderous but also incredibly satisfying.  This is the purist of the perfect information economic trading games.

RATING: 7
For some reason I had this game mixed up with some other game in my mind. I can't tell you what game I thought it was, except that it was some game that I played years ago that I really didn't like. I also had a vague idea it was an area control high-conflict type of game. So whenever I heard this game being suggested the combination of "long game" and "game I played and didn't like" didn't sound like something I wanted to play.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was an economic engine building game, which is definitely my type of thing, and definitely not whatever game I had been confusing it with. Generally when a game has this many cubes in it, I'm a happy camper.

The game starts with an open, largely undefined grid where you can place hex tiles. At the end of the game you'll get points for tiles you've placed on the board (4 each) and money (1 for 10). And you'll lose points for unpaid loans (-3 each). Loans are largely unavoidable in the game. And the more you take the less you get. Your first loan gets you 20 dollars. Each subsequent loan gives you a dollar less than the previous one. But they all cost $25 to repay and you have to pay a buck interest every round.

Each round you pay interest, then do a trading phase, where you're buying/selling from the resource markets or trading with other players. You can buy 3 items, sell 3 items or trade with one player. After everyone passes this phase, and that's after every player consecutively passes as players can jump back in, you go to the development phase where people spend cubes to build stuffs. After everyone passes, you go into a production phase, where people can feed and power their industries to produce cubes of stuffs.

There's six industries and five resources.

Yellow - Food - Used to feed industry before people automate
Blue - Energy - Used to power industry, automate and build cooler industries
Red - Labor - Used to put flags on the board and build cooler industries
White - Ore - Used to build most industries, including cooler stuff, and feed after automation
Black - iron maybe?? - Used to build most stuff, including cooler stuff, and automate
Purple - No resource, but produces money - Doesn't do anything except money

Each resource is available from its own market, or from other players that produce it. Each market has a quasi-limited supply of goods. Each good has a buy cost or sell price depending on which spot of the supply track it is on, until the market sells out, at which point the buy price maxes out, although things can still be sold back into the market.

It's always more expensive to buy a cube from a spot than it is to sell it to the same spot, so in order to make a profit, you need to either buy cheaply and wait for the market to go up or produce your own. The different markets have different values with goods ranging from cheapest to most expensive in the order yellow, blue, red, white and black.

The game is all about getting cubes cheaply, so that you can build up your infrastructure and/or sell them for a profit. Most of the game is building up your infrastructure, although you may try to make a profit on one type of cube just to afford some other type of cube. When you get near to the end game, there's a mad dash to get as many tiles on the board and to sell off your inventory. You still get money for goods after the game ends, but generally the prices are worse.

There's an interesting board aspect as you have to build adjacent to where you already exist. And you have to build where you have flags. Getting flags on the board requires red cubes. And every industry type has funky circles/half circles on it that determine how it produces, which is complicated and not worth going into. Expandding, and cutting people off, is a thing in the game.

And when you have industries, you have to feed them either with food (yellow) which is expensive 1 per hex, or with white 1 per group, which is much cheaper but requires a lot of investment to set up. You'll always have to power your industries with a blue cube, so that's always in demand. Yellow's don't need to feed themselves and blues don't need to power themselves.

There's a really interesting tension in that the things you need most in the early game yellow, blue, red are generally worth less. And the really expensive stuff is cooler but much harder to get. So you might want to build something that will be needed early and give yourself a headstart or play for a long game by building stuff that would be needed mid/late game. Balancing what to go into and how to play it is a difficult calculation, especially as it all teeters depending on what other players are doing. You're constantly re-evaluating the worth of stuff on the fly, and there's a lot to think about.

I found the game compelling and a lot of fun. There were a few drawbacks though. First and foremost, you really need to have played at least once to have a good idea of how to play. We played with six players and four players were new. I think there was a good bit of floundering to figure out how to play the game and I think it was only at the end of the game that several players really figured out how they should have played. That's not killer in games, although it's a bigger issue in a long game.

And that's the second issue. The game is long. Our play with six, which admittedly is probably not the ideal player count, was four and a half hours. I would have preferred a game that was at least an hour shorter. And some of the players who got stuck in bad positions seemed to be feeling the suffering for a long time.

The last issue I had is that the endgame is wonky. The end game is only triggered either....

1) When a player places all his flags. Which depending on how people have expanded might not happen (this might only be a six player problem though)

2) When all the hexes have flags. Which if even one player has a walled off garden, can be prevented.

3) When 5 of the 6 industry types have been completely built. Which triggered the end of the game in our six player play, but is probably harder in a lower player count.

So there could be a situation where one player has expanded in such a way that they can largely prevent the game ending and then just build up their position until they're ready to win. And it is likely that the player who has carved out the most space will win, as building tiles is the most efficient way to garner victory points. It ended up not being a terrible issue in our play, as the player who might have delayed the game could only make it spin out a turn longer, but the fact that it might have is an issue.

Also, the game is largely settled when you get near the end game. I felt like the final ranks of players were largely set a turn or two before the game was actually finished. It was just a matter of filling out all the forms, dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Players were going to build a final hex tile, produce and sell their goods. There really wasn't much chance that something unforseen or revolutionary was going to happen. The previous four hours had pretty much locked everyone into a course that they just had to follow through to the end game.

I did like the game a lot, but the length and some of the issues I mentioned make it unlikely that it will get played often.

RATING: 7
[thing=32666][/thing] is a good economic game. The game relies heavly on the players, since, between then, the market takes form, and, one or two players can bring it almost to a halt, since the commodities they have can be hogged, taking them out of the market and strangle the game by creating a bottleneck.

But this isn't a problem in the game itself. If one player takes almost all of something, you did something wrong, for sure (not in rules, but in playing badly).

[thing=32666][/thing] has a great trading system and they way production happens (by combining spots on hexes) is also really good.

Overall, a fine game that, sadly, I played not nearly enough to really appreciated.

My copy had two cosmetic problems out of shrink that should be noted: 

1) All of the boards came with a small (8/32nds or so) warp so they don't sit perfectly flat. The boards in WoN are double layered so that the cubes sit in a shallow hole and don't move around (much like Scythe's if you've seen those boards) which stops this from being any sort of game issue. 

2) For the red board, the top layer wasn't glued entirely to the bottom in one spot so I did it myself. It came out pretty well with the paper in that area getting a little bit of a tear that caused the ink to chip off. This chipping is about half an inch in two places.

Played at Origins 2008 and really like the game!  Like the decreasing value of the loans instead of the "pay a $1/share per round" which is usually found in games with loans.  Unfortunately, I just don't think a game of this length will get played in my gaming group more than once (maybe twice) in a year.  We already have too many 3+ hour games we want to play (Die Macher, TI3, Indonesia, Roads & Boats, Struggle, etc).  Maybe I'll just have to play this at cons and hope people already know the game so it doesn't take the 4+ hours my 1st game took.

It's a shame that such a good game turns so boring in the middlegame.  Only selling and buying one cube at a time is essential to the design but makes it so so so dry.  I wish the whole game was as good as the start.  I will play this if its suggested.  

But man can this thing get tedious.

With 5 players it was no fun at all. It might be just barely acceptable with 3, but I don't intend to find out. 

Many aspects seem poorly thought out, for example the promissory notes. It seems clear that you have to take a bunch of them early on to have a chance of doing well - I did not just to see what would happen, and while I was doing fine when we stopped the game, had it continued to the end I would have lost badly. Given that, the system as it is wastes time - either keep the loans as is and give everyone more starting cash (so you don't HAVE to take loans early, but it's an option), or make the loans more onerous by requiring interest payments, making the question of whether or not to take one an actual decision.

RATING: 5.5
This should be just the game for me but I really didn't enjoy it. There's very little drama for such a long game. You make a plan in turn 1 and can make very marginal adjustments to it every turn, and if you chose unwisely there's little to be done to correct it. Haggling over small differences in trade prices is another unnecessary source slowdown. The loans work, but they work in a stupid way.

The first half hour I wanted to love this game: Market manipulation, trading, economic engine building. Wow! What more could I ever want in a game? But slowly, as our four and half hour game unfolded, and as time started to drag, the design problems began to manifest. For example, taking loans in the game is an important part of the play, but there is no cost associated with the length of time one holds the loan. (Contrast this to Age of Steam where interest is due each round.) Thus a loan taken in the first turn has the exact same cost as one taken the last turn. Since each player needs money to build an economic engine, and there is no penalty for holding loans longer, shouldn't every player just take a lot of loans in the beginning? And if they all do, the "economic development" aspect of the game is short-circuited as three rounds of development get compressed into one because everyone is flush with cash. While in our game, a first try for four of the five players, this didn't happen, it is inconceivable that a second play wouldn't produce this undesirable effect without a house rule.

What bothered me even more than this loan problem though is the trading problem. The core of the trading phase is that each player (generally) specializes in a good (or two), but needs goods from other specialists (players) as an input to produce / increase their own. There is a market for each good with a "bid" and an "ask"-- in other words, a low price at which the good can be sold to the market and high price the good can be bought from the market. The spread between the two is the space in which negotiations occur. On some goods the spread is perhaps $2 or $3, on the higher priced goods this spread seemed to be around $6 or $7. All of the "trading" (basically) is negotiating a deal within this spread. Here is the huge issue with that: at the end of the game assume that you traded perfectly and were able to get a $1 advantage over every other player in each round. Our game went 7 rounds, but lets say a typical game goes 8 or even 9 rounds just to be liberal with the math. If you gain a $1 advantage over 4 players for 9 rounds you just pocketed $36. "Hurray!" You say. But not so much: Each $10 is a victory point. So in your flawless trading you earned 3 victory points. Assuming other players get dinged for 1vp from poor trading, the effect of this perfect trading will only impact the outcome at the margin as winning scores seem to be in the mid 40's or higher.

So, you just played 4 to 5 hours of game; 3 and half+ hours of it was this "trading" (no joke, it really is the bulk of game time) and for that 75%+ of game time, with superb play, you added less than 10% to your overall score. I know my description here is getting wordy, but it is important to add that the truth is, no one is consistantly getting a dollar edge over everyone else. The truth is that there is a lot of meeting exactly in the middle or getting a dollar bump here and there.... for... three... or... more... very.... long....hours...A counter argument might be made that since money is tight, a single dollar advantage could (in theory, in a particular round) allow a player to get a slight edge in building the economic engine as she or he could "just have enough" to get one extra cube to be used for something meaningful. And it is the case that remaindered money "a dollar short" and hence not put towards the engine during the building/production phase has a high opportunity cost, making a single dollar worth more than its notational value at times (when it turns the remaindered money into a cube.) But nevertheless, while I might enjoy haggling over a non-essential $1 for about 20 minutes max, as it pushes an hour of such wrangling, and I realize I am a monkey in a box, pushing the buttons but getting no treat, the next two+ hours of haggling over that same dollar becomes tedium defined.

Since I am piling on: why does the game begin with a draft for initial specializations? Why not start with an auction to fairly price the starting positions? Perhaps the draft is balanced (the consensus at our table was that it was not) but why not let the market decide? In a four and half hour game, replacing the draft with an initial one-time auction couldn't be accused of making the game drag.

I wish this game had been great-- or-- I wish it played in under two hours. Either way I would have been happy. But to be mediocre and take up most of a gaming session is unforgivable. I love meaty games, and I would rather play one long, intense game over four quick medium games. I really hoped this would satisfy and be a new alternative to Age of Steam, Indonesia or Die Macher. Sadly, it is a game that probably could have used a lot more development. I just noticed lots of geeks are proposing house fixes to some of the problems mentioned above. Too bad these changes weren't put it before the game was published...

Oh, you think your game is market driven?  No it isn't.  Games that are commonly cited as market games, like [gameid=2651], [gameid=12761], and [gameid=103184] have nothing on this.  This game is ruthlessly devoted to markets as the only mechanic that matters.  There's nothing else to optimize.  There's no limit on actions.  No limit on resources.  No limit on buildings, except as an end-game timer.

All that ruthlessness is combined with a really perfect art style.  Make no mistake, this is a very heavy economic game.  It certainly won't appeal to everyone, but it's impressive in it's purity.  There is a tendency for AP to hit, and it's overwhelming for new players, but it is something that rewards repeat play.  Make sure you grab the updated rules for better balance.

Like a fussier version of Power Grid, which is already a little too fussy for my tastes. The spatial element is somewhat interesting but gets muddled by the rote minutia of buying and selling resources and the ensuing mini-maxing and efficiency game.

In Wealth of Nations, you take on the role of a national leader. Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower. You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities. There are six types of Industry tiles: Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks. Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity: Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, Capital, and money (respectively).
\13\\13\
The main focus of the game is trade. Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require. Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.
\13\\13\
There is one Market for each type of Commodity. If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market. Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price. Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them. If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market. Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price.
\13\\13\
As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game, i.e., the player with the most valuable combination of Industries and money, is the winner.

Once you dive in, the gameplay is pretty straight forward and not at all complex. I enjoyed my limited time with it, I'd like to pick it up, but I'm just not sure I would have an easy time getting others to try it, due to the perceived complexity. 

It has Die Macheritis, so to speak.

One of the coolest market systems I've seen.  One play was very intriguing, but the winner (me!) was evident from about halfway through, which is no good.  Very interesting tile-placement aspects as well.  Allison liked it too, which was a bit surprising to me.

Another good but not great economic engine game.  I'm not quite sure how much game there really is here.  I felt like my course was largely set by my initial draw of packages.  After that, there were a couple of choices, but I found the choices pretty obvious.  This game is all about efficiency, so building factories in groups of 2 or 3 or whatever (depending on the color) really drives the game.  It also seems to take a bit too long for what it is.  For an economic game, I prefer Indonesia and/or Container.  After playing Sceptor of Zavandor, Neuland, and this one over the course of a couple of weeks, I think I also don't care for games where optimizing economic engines is the core of the game.  Like Neuland, I'd try this one again.

Like Euro games with multiple systems of economics? Like strategic placement of elements and synergistic production? Like running a country and mocking your friends with your superior gameplay? Than Wealth of Nations is for you!

Great game to play. Every player is always involved, because trading to the longest phase, and round robin style. Never bored, not having fun, even for a long game.
The design and information shown on the components is very good. The players mats almost all the information you would want on a cheat sheet.
However, the quality of the components leave much to be desired and detract from a very good game. One of my supply boards had to be glued upon opening the shrink wrap. Several others are starting to separate, as well . The cardboard flag markers and the paper money are only printed on one side, white on the reverse. The player mats are printed on thin glossy paper.

Interesting mechanics but way too much downtime with 6p.

Funny how a game named after a famous economics text could be so dry.

Very good economic game. You need to play with the expansion rules to fix a problem with loans in the original rules.

Played at kublacon and was lots of fun. It seems to balance itself according to any play style

5 after 1 play.

The market for each commodity is poorly simulated. Players are meant to simulate both the buying and selling sides of a market, and there are too few players to do that well. To make things worse, bartering is allowed, which seem to destroy any semblance of a properly functioning market.

Lots of negotiation during each barter trade slows the game down. Getting to trade only one item per negotiation worsens it.

A lot of addition going on in the game, probably much more than is required for a board game.

I only played this once with two players, but it was really interesting and would probably be a blast with 4 or more.  Not for those who dislike confrontation though.  "Yeah, I know you wanted that hex.  Tough shit brother."

Played using the expansion rules for shorter game and more balanced starting packages.

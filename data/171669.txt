This game moves very fast and therefore suffers when playing with people who aren't paying attention. This feature alone keeps me from upgrading it. Otherwise, it's very clever and I appreciate the weight of the dice as player-board markers.

Having played it's older brother, Lewis & Clark, I think there are two things in particular that I really like about this. First, the interaction is increased, and more direct (you can recall dice at the expense of your turn), so the resource management of your turns has another layer added where as piggybacking on cards others played in L&C was sort of a weak interaction to me. You still have the decision tree style planning that was exhibited in L&C (which was fundamentally a deep game vs a wide game), but it's different in that it's less of a "what resources am I not going to use" and instead "what order do I need to use them if there is one?" Second, it plays *much* faster. In a 2p game, we can rip through turns with no down time, but it drags at 4p, especially if you have someone who has AP as (just like in L&C) the biggest decision requires you to pre-plan a handful of turns in advance all at once so you keep encountering this bottleneck. Last, it appears as though the helpers (in this game represented by tribal negotiations) play a much more forward role in terms of engine construction for movement/effects, especially in terms of potentially shortening the game. My initial ding is related to the rulebook; I find some small things in terms of the process that one goes through when doing actions to be sort of obtuse. Possibly the heaviest dice game I've played fwiw and a possible 6, but not quite...

LIKE: Dice rolling and dice stealing is fun. I liked the exploration combo mechanisms and multiple paths to victory.
DISLIKE: A little fiddly on how combos can be done. Some of the iconography for dice placement are confusing at first. Deep thought can slow down turns as there isn't much player interaction. Poor dice rolls can make the game drag since turns are stretched out.

OVERALL: An enjoyable game that plays faster after everyone is familiar. Does it replace the bigger game, Lewis & Clark? Mechanically, no, but for theme, it does.

A little fiddly, but a very pretty and well-designed dice game.  Turns are pretty short.  The dice sharing/gathering makes for some interesting decisions.  Yeah, there are plenty of turns that are just setting up for others, but that didn't bother me much.  I really don't see many parallels to the original, and I'm not sure I'll get my own copy of this.

RATING: 6
1st play: A decently well crafted Lewis and Clark themed game that's similar to the card game.  The decision when to recall dice vs when to use dice to perform actions is similar to the mechanic used in the card version where you rest and pull cards back into your hand.  The mountains/rivers/Native Americans stuff invokes the theme well and the playtime is just about right for a dice based racing game.  Not Roll for the Galaxy level good, but decent.  Interested to see how it plays with 4.

2nd play: Played exactly the same as the first game, and fairly sure it would play exactly the same with 4 as it did with 2.  I didn't mind it, it just wasn't a better experience the 2nd time, and I usually hope for it to get better with more plays.

RATING: 9
FULL DISCLOSURE: I edited the English-language rules.

Vincent Dutrait's art in Lewis&Clark was beautiful; but it's even better in Discoveries...almost to the point of breath-taking! And each tribe card has art that is historically accurate for the specific aboriginal nation being represented: outstanding!

I think the art is what makes Discoveries seem much better-themed than L&C, while remaining not a heavily-themed game. Somehow, I'm more drawn into the story: "While hiking through these hitherto unknown mountains, I found a strange ungulate, which I have named the pronghorn;" or, "I sent out Nigel to negotiate with the Hidatsa, who, with further negotiation, might help us through those ominous mountains before us." In L&C, it's simply about making the right card combos, which is difficult to tie in to a narrative. Yes, card combos can certainly be fun: but I need my theme!

The game itself? One of those dice-as-workers placement games, and it gives Euphoria a run for the money as my favourite of that genre. One of the strategies is to secure alliances with as many of the aboriginal nations as possible...since they give you extra dice! Mind you, your "own" dice can be taken by your opponents under the right circumstances; but they can be taken right back again, so making use of an opponent's dice is fraught with peril. All in all, Discoveries is probably as interactive as L&C, but with more potentially negative interaction.

It's also lighter weight. It doesn't happen very often, but a string of bad dice-rolls can really hurt a player; but as I said, that's a rarity, as there's usually something that can be done with the dice you have. However, even though you're not going for card combos, you are still engine-building, since alliances with the tribes allow you special abilities, and you need to combine those to traverse through the more difficult terrain. A medium-weight game.

I prefer Discoveries over L&C for two reasons: the better art and themeing, and it's considerably more tense. In L&C, you have very little chance of recovering if someone has a vast lead on the route, and you usually know who's going to win no later than half a dozen turns prior to game end. Not so in Discoveries, due to each player's discoveries being hidden away under their journal cover. "Has Ned actually explored more territory than me? Then again, I know he has more tribes on his side...I think. And how many points is he going to be getting from his biological observations? Should I be snagging that cutthroat trout just so Ned doesn't?"

Probably at its best with three players, though still a very, very good game with two or four. Turns go by quickly. You may want to sleeve the cards, which are a little thin, but I dare not: I don't want to impair the beauty of the art!

Nations: the dice game: the lewis and clark game. There is zero theme in this game, the dice are flimsy, and the board is completely extraneous. Typing this out revised my rating from a 6 to a 5, no need to ever play this again. The interplay between the route cards becoming either an indian tribe or a route is somewhat interesting, and the dice interaction between players, but ultimately feels like a soulless, euroy dice fest with no real purpose or fun.

Die nicht einfach nur überdimensionierte Schachtel der deutschen Ausgabe ist überwiegend leer, enthält aber natürlich die Spielmaterialien, nämlich einen kleinen, einmal gefalteten Spielplan, 4 Spielerablagen, 4 Journal-Buchdeckel (d.h. Pappplättchen in Spielkartengröße), 55 Spielkarten, 35 Würfel und die deutsche Spielregel. Wäre der Spielplan von Lewis&Clark nicht etwas zu lang, ginge das ganze Spielmaterial von Lewis&Clark (Kleinteile in Zip-Tüten) und Discoveries locker in die Discoveries-Schachtel. Packt man alles in die Schachtel von Lewis&Clark, ist diese nur geringfügig überfüllt.

Das Material von Discoveries scheint wenig, gemessen an der Schachtelgröße, sieht aber alles sehr gut aus und verspricht nach Regelstudium ein interessantes Spiel zu werden. Ich hoffe, es bald spielen zu können.

Discoveries does some quite clever things with dice.  A range of actions require dice to be allocated, with some then being lost to one of two collective pools.  Anyone can scoop up a collective pool and make use of dice of all colours.  That is until an opponent decides to take theirs back.  Befriending Indian tribes brings more dice, more available actions and teepees (an end of game bonus scorer).  However, the main focus, as in Lewis & Clark, is on travel and exploration.   

Discoveries runs like a well oiled machine, with brief turns keeping downtime minimal.  However, decision-wise I found it as light as candy floss and there isn't a great deal of interaction beyond the grabbing and grabbing back of dice.

The artwork is very pleasing and production quality is good.  The English rules are well written if a little too keen to remind me of things they  have already told me.

Honestly I like it nearly as much as the heavier worker placement title, would probably break each out for a different crowd.

A gamers' dice game that feels less like Yahtzee and more like a puzzle, where players need to plan several turns ahead to optimize their decision. The gameplay is fluid, reminiscent of Lewis and Clark, and quite engaging. It also has an unusual amount of player interaction with how dice can be exchanged. And for someone who rarely like dice games, I'm a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed this one. 

I still need to play the game more to understand the influence of luck/randomness. But overall, I can see this game increasing in my ratings with multiple plays.

Discoveries is a dice game with the same setting of Lewis & Clark, but with a quite different mechanical approach.
Players use dice to activate actions and acquire cards ("exploring" them, or "befriending" natives). Some actions will require that your dice go to a common pool where other players can claim them on their turn instead of rolling, but you as well can take a turn to recall all your dice instead of rolling.
In the same way as in Lewis & Clarke, you want to get bonus cards that will give you movement boosts and that synergize with your other cards. 

There are some interesting timing decisions in using other people's dice or recalling your dice or claiming cards. Some actions will give you grey "temporary" dice. Once you start acquiring cards, you'll have special powers that break rules and such. Pretty standard stuff. 

One interesting aspect is the way dice go into the common pool to be claimed and the way you can get grey dice. If you time it right, you could have a huge pile of dice to roll. Of course, other players can recall dice at any time so what you had planned may be foiled: at any you need to pick your head up from your board and look around to guess at what players will do.

Not the most deep or exciting game out there, but quite interesting with its tactical and fast paced play.

Discoveries is a great hidden gem.  It has dice in it, but the dice act much more like randomly generated resources, as these resources stick around from round to round.  I just love how the dice on the board can be collected by both players during game play.  

In short, the game feels unique, and the feel of the game is unlike anything game I have played.  Though the game is several years old now, there is still nothing on the market like it.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I don't think this will end up on my top 10 games of 2015 when all is said and done, but this game is fun.  It is also deeper and more interesting than it initially looks.  Setting up your combos with the "American Indians", while also trying to keep up in exploration makes for some tough choices.  Also trying to decide which dice to take, and trying to use them before your opponents "recall" them can be very interesting.  This is one I expect to play much more of going forward, and I can definitely see why there was so much hype around it at Gen Con 2015!

2015, 2-4p, 60 min. Dice rolling, var pl pow, card drafting.

Based on Miami Dice video review and my experiences:

The game has a good sense of accomplishment since it feels like you're taking a journey as you complete cards and gather new, variable player powers when you draft new indian cards.  The dice flow/circulation/economy in the game is great and probably the best part of the game; when "resetting", you can either grab all dice on one half of the board (or the other) or you can pull all of your own dice back including ones that other players have "stolen" so you must try to use opponents' dice quickly before they pull them back),.. thus there's some racing/timing and "take that", but it makes it a very interactive experience for all players even when it's not their turn.  As a strategy note, you really should be trying to finish 2 cards per turn (or maybe every 2 or 3 turns) and getting the bonus for doing 2 cards; this requires careful planning (and luck obviously).  Regarding the components, there is a bit of a issue with the cards since the game has odd cards with one square corner and 3 rounded corners, making it harder to shuffle since you need to keep all of the cards facing in the same direction.

Compared to the original L&C game -- it's better for higher player counts (original L&C was just too slow with high player counts), and it maintains the punishment factor for things that you prepped and did not use, etc., forcing you to do clean/thorough planning.  It's a bit slow because you cannot split the river/mountains between 2 different segments of your journey... and if you play it wrong (allowing splits), it becomes too easy to finish 2 exploration cards on a turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this, the main mechanic seems neat, but the scoring mechanism just doesn't work for me at all. It's so easy to get screwed over by someone else taking the card you wanted. Such a shame, I like the main idea of the game and the dice system and gameplay is really innovative.

I put this on the same level as the Nations Dice Game in that it is a nice implementation of the original that plays faster with dice in it.

I have the original Lewis and Clark and I intend to stick with that one as it was just more fun for me.

Discoveries looks like a fast playing dice game, and it should be.  You play only a single kind of die face on your turn (or collect your dice instead), so it should move along quickly.  However, there are usually several options to consider.  So you need to take a minute to think through what you will do, and then you don't get to do much.  The end result is a game that feels ponderous - much thought for little action.  

In addition, it is both too long and too short.  All game, players face the choice of buying Discoveries (points, in various forms) or Indian Tribes (additional abilities, in various forms), which also come with an extra die.  By the time one has a few good tribes to enable Discoveries, the game is getting ready to end, and the Tribes go unused.  At the same time, we wanted the game to end sooner, because there's just not enough here to warrant 90 minutes of play.

I enjoyed this game a lot more then several other of my group members. 

I felt that this game, while a dice game didn't leave you at the mercey of the randomness of the dice. To me this game is more about manipulating your dice then it is about the dice rolls. Conservation of actions is a big part of this game, as the game can move quickly and leave you behind.

A dice placement game that has an interesting flow to it based on the interaction of how you can take back all of your colored dice even if another player has them on their board. It really makes you think about how to use the dice you have since they could be stolen. In addition, the gray dice can also suffer a similar fate once the common pool is gone. Once you understand that flow the games plays smoothly and turns can go very quickly. There is a small set collection aspect to the travel cards, but it is mostly about point grabbing those while also trying to gain special powers of the Native Americans. I'm already looking forward to more plays of this.

Nice super filler. I would not want to play this th peopl who take it too seriously. The game could be played that way, but I don't think I'd enjoy it as much. I always like games that do interesting things with dice, and this is one. Dice are effectively t you can only one one symbol (face) per turn, but as many as you want of the selected symbol. So having more dice is generally better, but not necessarily every turn. I like that you can "steal" other plays' dice, but it's not that big of deal to get them back, so it's really about the timing of reclaiming your own dice when the play(s) who stole them were about to use them. I also like the use of doubled sided cards. The Indian cards are what differentiate players, I like how plays start effectively the same, but quickly diverge. Plenty of replay. Having said that, my wife absolutely hated the game, and declared after here third try that she will never play again. I think because (a) you can't do as much as you want to do on your turn (she wants to use all her dice) and (b) you pretty much have to plan at least one turn again, and she prefers hitting home runs rather than stringing together singles+doubles. 

The one thing I'm not sure about is the rule about getting a bonus turn if completing two expedition cards in a single turn. It seems like it's already fantastic if you can complete two cards in one turn. I'm not sure why you need to also get a bonus turn. Seems like a windfall.

I think I like this game better than Lewis and Clark.  It still has a racing feel as you move through rivers and mountains, but it is dice driven.  There a specialty cards from the Indians that really help in getting though the travel cards.  There some element of set collection with the teepees and the flora/fauna cards.  But it really comes down to the dice and how they are manipulated on the board.

Finally decided to cut this, for a couple of reasons.  It's mainly a race to select proper combos of dice placement and card selection, but without the interesting aspect of dice drafting.  Sure, you can occasionally steal dice from the other player, but only if they're stupid, basically, or if you want to take a really weak turn.  Otherwise, it's just setting up your actions and proceeding along a pretty set path.  You want to try to hit two cards in a row as much as you can, because you get an extra turn (which is definitely powerful!) but there's risk to balance this.  Apart from this, there are no combos or interesting chains, not even to the very tactical, only one shot combos of something like Grand Austria Hotel.

The game doesn't have the excitement of a dice roller, or the interaction of a dice drafter; nor does it have the depth to compete with other games that take the same amount of time. 

Take away the amazing art and it's just a decent, but slow, dice game.  Go play real Lewis and Clark for that amazing art ;)

Initial play through (twice). Really quick lovely die game that doesn't feel so much as luck based as resource allocation-- being able to flip faces and respond to changing objectives.

A l'école, on vous a tous appris qui était Clovis, ou Charlemagne, qui ont initié l'Histoire de la France. Les américains, eux, ils ignorent complétement ces grands personnages. Par contre, tous les petits américains savent qui est Sacagawea, une indienne Shoshones qui a accompagné l'expédition de Lewis&Clark en 1804. La conquête de l'ouest américains !. Le Hit ludique "Lewis&Clark : l’expédition" , sorti en 2013, traitait du voyage, de la traversée de Saint Louis au Pacifique. Discoveries reprend la même thématique, mais s'attarde sur la partie découverte : les plantes, les animaux, la géographie et les rencontres avec les indiens. Avec un habile mécanisme de gestion de dés, vous allez devoir faire un maximum de découvertes pour l'emporter et revivre un peu de cette magistrale expédition. Graphiquement, ce jeu est une œuvre d'art.

I'm a huge fan of the boardgame so I picked this up right away, but it didn't click for me. It's still got the cool theme and great art, and I love the dice stealing mechanism, but the rest of the dice play is kind of fiddly and opaque. I wanted to like it but it's a near miss for me.

Je gooit dobbelstenen. Je kiest één van de symbolen op de dobbelstenen. Met alle dobbelstenen die ditzelfde symbool hebben, voer je acties uit op je bord. Je kan bijvoorbeeld een dobbelsteen gebruiken om het symbool van andere dobbelstenen te veranderen, om nieuwe acties te bekomen of om een ontdekking uit te voeren.

Om die ontdekkingen draait het allemaal. Een ontdekking is een kaart waarop bergen en rivieren staan. Je moet die bergen en rivieren verzamelen door dobbelsteenacties op je speelbord uit te voeren.

Deze ontdekkingskaarten leveren punten op en punten heb je nodig om het spel te kunnen winnen.

Wanneer je dobbelstenen hebt geactiveerd op je speelbord gaan ze daarna naar de linker- of de rechterhelft van het hoofdspeelbord. Dobbelstenen die een indiaan- of abc-symbool vertonen, gaan naar de linkerhelft van het hoofdspeelbord. Dobbelstenen die een hoefijzer- of voetstappen-symbool vertonen, gaan naar de rechterhelft van het speelbord.

Tijdens je beurt kan je ervoor kiezen om geen dobbelstenen te activeren, maar in plaats daarvan alle dobbelstenen van de linker- of de rechterhelft van het hoofdspeelbord te nemen (zowel eigen dobbelstenen als dobbelstenen van andere spelers). Hierdoor heb je terug meer dobbelstenen ter beschikking. Je kan nu niet alleen je eigen dobbelstenen, maar ook de dobbelstenen van je tegenspelers gebruiken en activeren.

Je kan er ook voor kiezen om alle dobbelstenen in je eigen kleur terug te nemen. Dit zijn niet alleen je eigen dobbelstenen die op de linker- of rechterhelft van het hoofdspeelbord liggen, maar ook je eigen dobbelstenen die bij je tegenspelers liggen.

De speler met de meeste punten wint het spel. 

Er staan overwinningspunten op de discoveries kaarten. Daarnaast kan je nog punten scoren door een meerderheid aan tipi’s te verzamelen of door setjes van verschillende symbolen te verzamelen.

Pleasant light die roller set in the Lewis & Clark "universe".  Players roll dice representing their faction of the Corps of Discovery, and assign them to exploring sections of cards.  When fully explored, other die results "journal" the exploration, banking them for points.  The flip side of the cards are the native tribes, that grant abilities to explore faster, at the cost of time to recruit them.

Really nice, not deep at all, but some nice decision points, and finished off with some superb production - the game looks truly beautiful, and nice touches like the three rounded corners/one square corner on the deck of cards doesn't hurt either.  

Much better than other recent dice rollers, but long term may be a bit same-y.

Really pleasant family-weight dice game that is very approachable with lovely presentation/flavor.   I particularly liked the way that the different color dice inevitably spread around.  The action to increase your dice pool from the river banks or recall your own dice is an interesting choice.   The scoring isn't the most original, perhaps that's my only knock on it.  But, overall, I really enjoyed this and would happy to add a copy to the collection.

I've not played the other, more popular L&C game.  I had no idea that these two games were related.  Suffice to say that my comments on this one stand on their own and aren't informed by that other title.

Such as it is, Discoveries is a dice-chucking game and while luck plays a pretty big part in it (not just your dice, but the available cards to "purchase"), you can always manipulate dice in your favor so long as you are willing to spend a turn doing so.

In short, you roll dice, use them to select actions, and send a surplus to the board to be picked up at another time.  For example, commit 3 dice to an action, keep one, send the other 2 to the board.  You can spend dice to either queue up some travelling actions, pick up tribe cards which grant various bonuses and/or more actions, or you can manipulate your unused dice to prepare for something else.  The trick here is that travelling needs to be triggered by a journal face on a die and if you don't trigger all of your desired ones at once, you miss out.  At any time, you can instead choose one half of the board and take all of the dice there and put them into your pool... or you can simply take back your own color, thereby possibly robbing other players who were borrowing them.

I surprisingly liked Discoveries.  It's a clever design that plays quickly, but it's definitely not - in my opinion - something you can play competitively.  Sure, there is a race for points, but I find that while you can manipulate the dice, the deck is another story altogether.  Taking a card from the travelogue or the tribes always requires that a replacement is drawn; however, these cards are all double-sided so they all come from the same deck.  It's quite possible that something you've been prepping for doesn't even find its way to where you thought it was going to be (depending on which side you have the deck as face up).  

One of the elements of the game is collecting sets of four icons.  These icons are very limited in terms of how many are in the deck.  One of them, for example, only occurs 5 times on one side of the card; I saw 3 of them get burned by flipping them over to tribe cards - that's 60% of the total pool that you can't ever get, even if you pick up the tribe card it became.  Something like an action to flip them over would have worked wonders here, but thematically, I understand why that isn't a thing.  In the end, however, it makes the whole set collection thing a total crapshoot and while I think the game is enjoyable, there's not much going on in terms of putting together any strategy beyond 2 turns at best.

So to me, I find it a very light-hearted romp that is fun because chucking dice around is always a good time, but there's a strategic element under the surface that's just waiting to come out, yet it never does.  Thus, I think Discoveries is a good design, but it misses a few opportunities that could have made it great.

A decent game but nothing really exciting for me. It is multiplayer solitaire in a bad way. There is very little interaction and little incentive to really pay close attention to others. A four player game drags on for too long. I think if the game played faster (either moving faster or a shorter playtime) then it would have been more enjoyable. As it is it takes too long for not offering a lot of fun.

I really like this Lewis & Clark spin-off. Rules take a little time to wrap your head around (as did it's older brothers). A few grudges:
1. the game would have fit in a lot smaller box if they had made the overly large center board smaller. Almost in one of those Fantasy Flight small boxes (citadels, space hulk...).
2. doesn't work with 2 players. Working on some house rules to fix the problem.

Very intelligent design of a dice game, which I don't usually like (e.g. Kingsburg). This however has excellent strategy, with player interaction and many options. I am perhaps concerned with replayability and game length, though the latter may serve to mitigate randomness and helps catch-up (runaway leader is rarely an issue in this game).  Rule gaps in some areas though (Sioux cards, dice recall from stock), so review errata or FAQ.

Note, although from the same artist and publisher, this game has completely different mechanics from the 2013 Lewis & Clark (a card-driven w-p race type game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game revolves around its amazing dice recall mechanism (the 'Rest' action). The decisions of when to recall dice, and where to recall them from, make up the heart of this game, and lend to the game's uniqueness and healthy player interaction. The recall mechanism is so strong that I've decided to play this strictly as a 4p game; not because its bad at two or three, but because it is immeasurably more enjoyable with a full expedition (and all of the dice). The American Indian cards offer a dose of engine/combo building, and challenge players to act efficiently. The game has proven to be a bit unintuitive for some, but once players learn how turns work, and how explorations are triggered, downtime becomes basically nonexistent, and play zips around the table. I only wish to have more of the American Indian abilities focused on dice manipulation rather than exploration, because those are far and away the most fun.

A dice game based on [thing=140620][/thing]. After you roll dice and use them, certain actions will require that your dice go to a common pool where other players can claim them on their turn in lieu of rolling. You can take a turn to recall all your dice in lieu of rolling. Like L&C, you want to get bonus cards that will give you movement boosts and that synergize with your other cards. 

There are some interesting timing decisions about using other people's dice/recalling your dice/claiming cards. Some actions will give you grey "temporary" dice. Once you start acquiring cards, you'll have special powers that break rules and such. Pretty standard stuff. 

The fun point seems to be the way dice go into the common pool to be claimed and the way you can get grey dice. If you time it right, you could have a huge pile of dice to roll. Of course, other players can recall dice at any time so what you had planned may be scuttled. You need to pick your head up from your board and look around to guess at what players will do re: their dice and plan accordingly.

I liked its older brother, but here appreciated the more accessible weight and faster play. Fun, beautiful, accessible, while still demanding calculated play to win (free plays are key). More importantly, I find myself wanting to play it again!

Update: There's just something about this game that charms me. I suppose it's the beautiful art plus a comfortable level of engine-building and/or tactical logistics. It's lovely.
Interestingly, my otherwise formidable 8-year-old still has a hard time wrapping his head around the timing and engine-building in this game, whereas he just crushes 7 Wonders, suggesting to me that it's a bit more wonky than I want to admit.

January 2016: Thematic connection and one mechanical idea borrowed from big brother board game Lewis & Clark. The original game is a small-deck deckbuilder with agonizing decisions; this game is a quicker puzzle of setting up dice on abilities then triggering several actions at once to "explore" (i.e. claim) Discovery cards. The dice game swaps out tense deckbuilding and cardplay for more forgiving tableau building. I bought this for my wife for Christmas, and we finally had time to learn it and it went over incredibly well. Our second play only took 20 minutes, and we enjoyed setting up alliances with the First Nations to be able to do massive exploration actions.

This was an interesting one.

I liked the theme, and the dice mechanic was very interesting.  There is a push/pull on when to take back all your dice, versus grabbing a whole pool of dice of other colors, especially if there are gray dice.

I thought that the extra turn you get for completing two cards at once was a bit much.  While we only hit that scenario about 3 times, it felt a little too good.

I would say that it is very difficult to get a full set of discovery icons, almost too difficult.

Excellent reinterpretation of Lewis and Clark which is one of my favorite games. I like how the dice sharing works. First you want mostly Indians because no one can take them from you, but once the supply runs out you do not want to have the majority of them.

The only complaint I have is that some of the native american cards make the game too easy, which is a shame as I like a challenge. Otherwise a great game with beautiful artwork and solid easy rules.

Dice placement game. The theme is pasted on but I will give it props for the favor in the rule book and how nice the dice are

The mechanics in this game are quite cool and you can play it pretty loosely or try and plan things out more. There is some play here in regards to the dice retrieval and how you setup your board.

Kind of sucks that you can lose all the fish or one type of set card when playing with less people but that's ok. The sweet spot seems to be 3p but I haven't tried it at that count yet

Nice and interesting dice game. Away from the layout / illustrations and the fact that you need to cross river and mountain spaces, this doesn't have anything to do with "Lewis & Clarke" the boardgame.

This however isn't a bad thing, in fact it is a good thing, as I don't need the same game just with dice. While I'm unsure how many plays this can hold up, it's one of the better dice games, as this is all about planing instead of lucky rolls. Good one!

Nice action efficiency dice game. Great art and theme.

Unfortunately it seems like the randomness of the dice has more influence over player efficiency than the players' choices. Good decisions and card acquisitions can mitigate luck and make more dice results at least somewhat favourable. But in the end you'll still end up spending more turns than you would have done if the dice had just came up showing the "right" sides. But it's a dice game, so that's kind of what to expect.
Be warned, It can be a bit frustrating.

I love Lewis&Clark and this has been mega high on my wishlist for a few months since I first heard of it. But my first play was really meh. So sad.

It's merely ok. The artwork and components are top notch, but the game itself sits at a "4" for me, just below average. Granted I only played it once, twice including a "ghost play-through" to learn it, but there isn't enough game here, in the two  run-throughs I did of it.

The mechanics are interesting and easy to understand, mostly..more on that in a bit. But they're not engaging and the whole thing felt quite abstract really. It's just a rush for VP and sets and to get the best Native American tribe cards to help you complete two cards in one turn, which gives you an extra turn. Rich get richer, never a fun mechanic in a game. There's a lot of little rules details that hamper this one as well, that can be easily overlooked. I felt the rule book was hard to understand simple concepts. Didn't do a good job of explaining everything to make sense, but it isn't really hard at the end of the day.

I doubt I'll play this one again. Not interesting, luck-dependent, abstracted engine builder that failed to even mildly entertain.

Rules easy (but need to be read carefully).
Theme is very present and every game is different from the previous one, because you don't always play with the same cards (f.e. 25 cards are randomly removed from a deck of 55 before 2-player game).
Fun and clever to optimize your die roll, there's always a way to use a dice you didn't expect (or want).

Similar art and theme as the original game (Lewis & Clark), but a very different feel. On your turn you recall dice (and roll them), or place all of one type of symbol. If you have any actions filled, you may then activate them. Most actions require two different types of symbols so there is a bit of planning involved here. Most points are scored by completing the route cards--it might be three rivers in a row or two rivers and two mountains, etc. You must have those modes of traveled filled with dice on your action board in order to complete them. There are cards you can acquire to give you more options on your action board with more flexible travel methods (ie: "3 river or 3 mountains").

Some of the actions or dice placement require you to give up your dice to the board, on the "left" or "right" side, depending on the action. They may be recalled back to your dice pool in the future.

The interesting thing is when you recall dice. You choose one of the following: a) all of your-colored dice b) all of the dice on the "left" side of the board, or c) all of the dice on the "right" side of the board. This means you can possible scoop up dice that belong to other players. You get to hold onto them until the other player(s) decide to recall all of their-colored dice; then you must give them back, even if they are sitting on your action board.

Decent game, but probably too light for me.  I wanted to be able to build more of an engine with my card tableau, but you can't really put much together.  I also wanted the dice mechanism to be more like a puzzle, but instead the dice placement feels very straightforward.  Discoveries is nevertheless pleasant and plays fast.

A great artwork, a feel of traversing difficult terrain and an interactive race for points in three aspects. There is a magnet inside the game which calls for another play. A super quick setup time, a quick game and the clever engine building system built upon dice rolling. The minimalism in its best.

The basis of Discoveries is a deck of cards that has contracts on one side and action improvements on the other. The single deck supplies cards to both drafting displays, which theoretically changes up the options from game to game depending on which card ends up in which group. I say "in theory" because there a multiple versions of most action cards and the contract cards (which has players journeying over a combination of rivers and mountains) all feel like slight variations of each other. So, while the opportunity is there to differentiate and add variety, I think those opportunities are sacrificed in the name of balance. The dice mechanics are solid, with used dice going to a central pool which allows players - temporarily - to use the dice of other players. Players can also choose to reclaim dice of their own color, thereby stealing them back from the other players. Not a bad game, but it feels over-tested and balanced to a point of blandness.

路易斯與克拉克的發現之旅，這是個簡單卻不失趣味的骰子遊戲，每回合玩家的動作很簡單，放骰子或是取骰子，這兩個動作看似容易卻富含拿捏時機的策略，玩家必須想辦法完成路線拿取分數，或是與印第安人交關得到強力的幫助。
美術上承襲了原作的畫風，特別的是每張卡片沒有相同的圖畫，瀏覽每張卡片宛若欣賞美國西部的荒野史，特別的是骰子都是木製的，拿取的手感真的有別於一般塑膠骰，遊戲進行一場下來時間也控制得很好，大約45~60分鐘左右，近期幾款大作的骰子遊戲其實都做得蠻棒的，不論是國家骰還是瘟疫骰，咖啡骰等等我的評價都不錯，Discoveries 發現之旅 也將會列入我收藏的骰子遊戲中。

Wow!  This game rings so many bells for me.  It's got custom dice, a historical theme that is woven tightly into the gameplay, beautiful artwork, dice action selection, a puzzle-y feeling...I'm chomping at the bit for my next opportunity to play.  Turns can happen so fast, making the game fluid.  There is this greed mechanic built in that challenges you to complete two routes on a turn so you can have a second turn.  Love it!

I very much like the light engine building aspect combined with making your dice only semi-owned by you. Unfortunately the game also gets a bit repetitive pretty quickly  and although there's a lot of different cards and not all of them are in play at the same time I still have a bit of a doubt about long term replayability. High production values and top notch graphic design.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The art is nice, the game plays smooth and the iconography (for the playerboards) is nice. The indian cards allow you to customize your available actions and really plan some big moves. Since all faces give you actions there's no real bad roll and even then you can sack dice to change the faces.

The iconography for the indian cards is not all that clear without consulting the rulebook quite a few times and planning big moves punishes you harder than executing lots of small moves despite those small moves allowing you more flexibility. Rulebook isn't very clear on everything, certainly not at first glance. Customizing available actions through indian card can feel random and really lacks any strategic depth. It's all quite tactical actually.

So good and bad... I like it! Really fun and smooth playing dice game.
If all players know the game then I'd guess it even plays quite fast.

2016-08-27 - 7.5 - I like how it looks, how you build your not too complicated engine and how quickly the turns pass. I guess it's faster than 60 minutes from the box (at least with 3 players). Double sided cards from which you use only part of them every game should give decent replayability.

2016-09-05 - 7.5->7 - Cool, pretty fast dice game. I really don't like using house rules, but we played it once wrong. After exploration action we put all the dice to the camp, not to our board. The game was more interesting that way I guess, because the dice circulated between players more frequently. We'll see which way we will play.

2017-02-14 - 7 -> 6.5 - I like this game but it's a little too long for what it is and when a smaller-like game takes an hour I prefer to play something else, especially now when I don't game too often.

RATING: 6
The luck factor of the dice with the puzzle aspects of the travel is not coherent. In this game, if you roll what you needed makes a huge difference from a bad roll. Changing the face of dice costs too much (most of the time you only do this in a turn). The best part is getting other peoples dice and the pressure of using then before your opponent takes it back.

A totally different game than I expected. So I have to check out games more than I currently do.

This is a decent family game. We played with two and it works well. Not sure how the game will work with four. Looks you will rest to gain your own workers back.

Gameplay is opportunistic. Not a lot of planning to do before your turn basicly your three choices are.

Rest : which is not a real option but something you have to do to gather dice.
Execute your discovery. (do one step in them)
Get a tribe or change your discovery (for the sets). I got one tribe and exchanged one discovery in the entire game. Instead of working at my discoveries when I could so.

Now this one is solid dice game. Discoveries is easy to get into it and dice mechanic is nicely done. What they did totally wrong in Lewis & Clark (too lengthy) - that's not a problem here, because one game takes about 45 minutes. I owned this for a while and played it quite many times and then had the feeling, that it's a bit too repetitive so I sell it away. And if I really have want to play it, one member of my playing group still owns it which is enough for me.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was a dice game I was planning on ignoring but I have really enjoyed my two plays thus far and may well end up picking up a copy for myself. The interesting aspect of this dice game that is unique is basically how the dice are obtained within the game - one can claim back one's own color dice which can mess with other people using your dice, acquire Native American dice by coming to agreements with tribes, or grab a pile of spent dice dependent upon which actions they had been used for and discarded to. There's more here than initially met the eye, that's for sure. I do think it is easy to get caught up acquiring the help of Native tribes and forget that most points actually come from mapping out areas and discovering species and flora.

Roll dice to get icons to progress across the map cards or convince the natives to help you out even the hostile ones it just takes more convincing.

I love the theme of this game and as such it pains me to just rate it as just okay. The dice pool stealing mechanic is clever but the game is a bit too long for what it is and I find myself just a little disengaged while playing it.

It's a nice game, and one that offers some enjoyment but it didn't really wow me.

Beautiful components, especially if you live in the NW like I do.  Good quality card and art, nice wooden dice, nice to see the known tribes and the tidbits about the Lewis and Clark expedition.  Easy to pick up and play.  Interesting mechanism with the borrowing of other players workers and temporary workers.  Negatives:  Too long with 4 players.  This might change for repeated plays but given the simple mechanism it feels repetitive after a while.  Possible slow runaway leader problem.  More precisely it felt hard to catch up or upset the winning order halfway through the game, no ways to dramatically or surprisingly change score.  Limited choices.  It feels as though the available choices every turn are somewhat limited.  I am not a big fan of WP games to begin with, so I would naturally rank it lower.  I would like to play it again given the beautiful components to see if it is different on repeated play, but there are other WP or other type games that I prefer.  Actually rank it 8 for quality, 6 for experience, reserve final ranking upon further plays.

Discoveries is a lovely little game! We can set it up, play it, and put it away in 30 minutes flat. It has a small footprint, so we can play it on the kitchen table when other games have taken up residence on our game table. It's so smooth to play, turns move quickly, and yet it has a nice amount of thinkiness and depth. And the theme and artwork are so classy. (Note to self - house rule: in a two player game, shuffle one card each of flora, fish, bird, mammal into random 26 cards to make the set collection more significant.)

I'm afraid Roll for the Galaxy may have ruined other dice games for me.  Discoveries is a perfectly fine game and worth a couple of plays.  Provides a bit of tension as you race to complete different journeys.  Unfortunately, I feel like Roll has more tension plus greater diversity in strategies - and both play in about the same amount of time.  Discoveries also feels quite a bit lighter than Roll.  I'm almost always going to pull out Roll over Discoveries.

The components in this game are beautiful, the artwork is stunning. I wish I could like this game more. The game is definitely better for higher player counts, in 2-player games it is not as appealing as part of the tactics comes from taking the grey dice or all of the dice from one of the sides of the board; which in higher player counts is more interesting. In addition, the choosing of one action/turn makes the game a bit slow (especially in 2-player games) and sometimes there is luck when being able to collect the fauna/flora tiles from opponent.

I was wary of this game initially since I'm not usually a big fan of games that rely on dice rolling heavily as a mechanic, but I was happily proven wrong by this one.  The game is fun and quick paced and thematically excellent.  The art is gorgeous and there are a number of fun strategic choices - I also felt that the luck factor of the dice was mitigated since an action available to you is too change two dice on your turn to whatever symbol you need.  Only downside to this game that jumps to mine is that is very symbol heavy - which can definitely be overwhelming to new players.  This game also could have benefited from having a good player aid/summary sheet included.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the more thematic dice placement games I can think of, thanks to the beautiful art and historical details. In 2-player, I love how you're constantly trying to set up 2 discovery combos, but sometimes forced to go shorter term to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves. In 4-P there seemed to be less potential to utilize borrowed dice, but the dynamic was still very cool. I'll be playing this one a lot more, and my wife loves it 2P.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I loved Lewis & Clark (but not with 4players), I still do but I can't get it to the table enough. I end up playing it solo every now and then ... which for me does not bring quite the same experience. I enjoy it solo but its not the same.

Discoveries, everyone I have played it with has enjoyed it. It's simple enough to explain but fairly meaty for a dice game (well for me anyway). It also is enough of its own game to keep alongside Lewis & Clark in any collection. For the moment I enjoy this one more because 1/ I can get people to play it more often and 2/ it is shorter. 

But that being so why have I spent most of this post discussing Lewis and Clark. Possibly there is no need to keep both? Am I subliminally convincing myself to get rid of one of them? As of right now if I had to it would be Discoveries to go. Purely because I am holding out for that one great thematic game of Lewis and Clark. Discoveries is its own beast but for me the only criticism would be its rinse and repeat gameplay (and the quickness of turns which make this rinse and repeat more apparent). But isn't that the case with Lewis and Clark as well? Yep it is. You're right I can't choose between them. But I do know I played Discoveries 6 times more than Lewis and Clark last year. That should tell me everything I need to know.

Great production, great artwork, great game, keeper for now (or is it?)

A great dice game with a theme that works nicely with the mechanics.  The interaction between players is subtle but critical. Do I try to talk to more tribes to get help? Or do I try exploring more for points? Do I place this one die here, or many dice there? It all works seamlessly and your decisions feel weighty throughout.

Nice quality components too.

RATING: 8.5
Very fun game.  Seems light enough to get to the table easily with more casual gamings friends, but deep enough that you feel like you have some control and have real decisions to be made.  I like that it's a medium-light game that takes a full hour.  Medium-light to medium is the sweet spot for my wife and me but sometimes the lighter games also come with filler play times.  We want to spend 1-1.5 hours at the table that this game does that without being a brain burner. 

Like it's big brother, Lewis and Clark, the art is gorgeous and the theme is dripping.  However also like its big brother the components themselves are iffy in quality.  Super thin, flimsy cards once again and even the cardboard used isn't very stiff. 

If you like Lewis and Clark this is worth  buy.  However if you don't like any randomness in a game, stay away.  While various American Indian cards you can collect as well as the basic board itself do allow you to mitigate the dice rolls to come extend the order cards come up along with the dice rolls will have to influence your decisions.  I would call this more of a tactical game than a strategy game.  If you set out from the beginning to pursue a single strategy you're screwed if the dice and cards don't go your way.  The winner will be the person who can think on their feet and adapt best to what is in front of them.

The drawings are gorgeous (the best I've seen in any game). And I really tried to stay in role (saying things I supposedly do, e.g. "I send two of my guys to talk to Indians" instead of what I actually do (e.g. buy a card for two indian-head dice)). But still it's a dry euro game about getting cards, not a game about exploring Missouri River. In "dry euro" category, however, it's a very good one.

Very smooth dice placement game. The dice recapture mechanic is neat - take back all of your own dice, or all the dice from one of two locations (and this pool may include dice of your opponents as well as gray neutral dice). This builds in a bit of a timing mechanism as to when to take and use opponents' dice before they have an opportunity to take them back. The Indian cards that act as dice modifiers are very strong as they can be obtained for one die, provide you with a gray die, and contribute to the teepee majority bonus at the end of the game. I think you need to get one or two of these early in the game to win.

Update: downgraded. It's just a dice game, which means it has dice, which means it has lots of (bad) luck, insufficient ways to mitigate that.

Love lewis and clark, not sold on this dice version. It has a lot going for it, nice components, graphics, interesting rules and shot play time. For me this game offers to little real interesting choices. After a few plays it is obvious what is the best move almost all of the time. For a dice game it lacks the excitment and fun because you hardly roll at all. Your dice are random recources which works, but is not that exciting. Not a bad game, but after 4 plays I am done with the game.

I really like how the theme comes through in this one.  It takes a lot of what I like about it's larger brother, Lewis and Clark, and distills it into a smaller package.  There a ton of options for managing and mitigating your dice, and provides a host of strategic possibilities.  I like it at all player counts, but the feel is very different with each.  If pushed, it's probably best at 3.

A fun dice / worker placement game where the dies are shared amongst the players in a unique way. There are several possible actions making the roll of the dices less important towards winning or losing.
The players can only execute a single small action in their turn which hampered a fluent flow of the game.
There is a lot of interaction through the shared dices, a central display with action and scoring cards and a central dices display.

A dice-based worker placement game with a few twists that make it a fun affair in the gateway realm and different enough from the original game with a similar name. 

In essence the players are aiming to explore new terrain, and catalogue new plant and animal species. Native American Tribes need to be contacted in order to make your travels easier and all of this is done by making the most of your resources from a pool of dice.

This game is a little difficult to teach newcomers, but after a few rounds, people get the hang of it. I really like the dice management in this game and you always have a way to get more. The abilities your characters have all start out the same, but the Indian cards add a load of ability triggers to your arsenal and are very easily attainable. You can even get some chain reactions going on which can be cool. A surprise hit with me, as the theme wasn't very attention-grabbing. After playing multiple times I actually really enjoy the theme and the "journal" dice which trigger the actions ties in well.

The art is really impressive, but the components are just average. Light wooden dice, normal cardstock and oversized board.

Its most outstanding feature is the dice management system. The "dice borrowing" is brilliant and the options that the system gives you are more than enough (AP prone players might have a hard time in some turns). There's a bit of strategy, heavy on tactic, and of course, the luck of the dice. But even with bad rolls you can do things.

The duration, 1 hour, is perfect for this game.

The only thing that doesn't convince me is the huge importance of having a couple of native american cards with good ability (or dice manipulation) abilities. Some ones are way better than others.

Gradita e inaspettata sorpresa. Avevo bollato un po' il gioco come spin-off di Lewis & Clark, Discoveries invece ha una sua identità ben precisa e personalmente mi ha stupito per capacità di aggiungere al fratello maggiore alcuni dettagli precedentemente carenti (interazione). Innanzitutto Discoveries è un gioco di dadi e questo potrebbe far storcere il naso per (e si avverte) la dipendenza dalla sorte. Come in altri recenti giochi simili però il lancio dei dadi potrà essere modificato o migliorato. A dispetto di L&C in Discoveries ho trovato una interessante interazione, trovo fondamentale tenere d'occhio gli altri e anche sul finire della partita cosa che avvertivo poco in L&C. Inoltre durante lo svolgimento del gioco non si ha mai la precisa sensazione di chi stia vincendo. Infine ho trovato in Discoveries una buona ambientazione che, seppur appiccicata, può risultare gradevole.

[b]Discoveries[/b] was sold via auction 9/22/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I had really enjoyed my initial plays and ended up getting a copy as a birthday gift at the end of December (thanks again Mat). It took me a while to get it to the table with my kids because we had so many new games from Christmas, etc. Once we finally played it was a hit, not only did they both enjoyed the dice manipulation and all the aspects of the game play but they really dug the artwork and theme. We've only played a few times, but each game they are trying out different strategies from focusing on set collection, collecting teepee cards and focusing on the American Indian cards. 

This is a solid game and one that will continue to see play in my house. We need to teach it to my wife because it has just the right amount of rules overhead to complexity that she enjoys. I'll also echo my earlier sentiments that this game plays well with two, it may not be the best player count but it's still a lot of fun.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- I've seen some debate on the topic, but I really enjoyed Discoveries with 2.
- The artwork is beautiful (and I really appreciate the fact that they are actual paintings and not digital artwork).
- The common die pool mechanic creates player interaction since grabbing someone else's dice can really help you out (unless they recall their dice before you use them).
- Excellent blend of dice manipulation, racing to score cards and collecting the American Indian cards.
- This game moves along because you only get to take one action on your turn (it can slow down a bit when someone is figuring out how to complete multiple cards).
- Discoveries has a nice progression arc to it, it does not suffer from the fits and starts of Lewis and Clark, and in my opinion is the far superior game.

I am looking forward to getting in more plays of this game and I think it will be a hit with my family. I'm sure we will add a copy to our collection soon, especially since my kids are focusing on early US history this year and this would be a fun game to play when they need some downtime.[/i]

心得:
跟卡牌版主題類似
也是想辦法組出適合自己的移動引擎
然後再選適合的路線探索
思考時間頗長，因為要等骰子的結果(主要是連續探索成功的額外行動造成)
策略重點是在一次完成兩張探索來獲得額外行動
然後收集對應組數動物獲得分數
用骰子時要小心會被收走
策略度還好
規則:
*圖板左側為住民卡跟日記協調面骰棄骰區，右側為探險卡跟走路騎乘面棄骰區
*2/3/4人使用6/8/10顆灰骰跟30/40/50張卡片(多的隨機移除)，被移除的可以看，牌庫探索面朝上，抽三張住民面補在圖板左側，三張探索面補右側(第一次玩數字>37重補)
*每人拿一個顏色骰跟個人圖板(確定使用正確面)
*隨機起始，每人按順位挑一張探索卡(一拿就補)，之後在骰骰子放對應區
*照順位輪流，每次有兩個選擇，玩到沒辦法抽探索卡補充為止，所有其他玩家最後一回合
A 使用一種骰面的所有骰子執行自己圖板或卡牌上動作，每種行動最多執行一次，順序自選，全部動作做完骰子棄到主圖板對應區
>印第安骰面  *1: 拿友好住民卡跟1灰骰   *2: 拿謹慎住民卡跟1灰骰   拿灰骰就直接骰
*灰骰供應區沒的時候跟最多灰骰的人拿，由他決定給你哪顆，如果是自己就沒辦法拿
>任意骰面 *1 換一到兩顆到指定骰面，當回合不能用  *1跟主圖板探索區換卡
>各種骰面組合 移動要先放右邊的條件，之後再放日記骰啟動(四顆日記可直接移動山)移動水或山
*移動時不能任意拆分山水移動點數，但順序可隨意
*有兩格的一次要用兩顆，一顆放上面，另外一顆放到圖板棄骰區
*如果單次的移動力超過自己原本那張，可在多探索圖板旁三張(一次最多多探索1張)，且馬上在有一回合，探索成功的牌蓋著放個人圖板中間，在從目前開著的挑一張，然後所有骰拿回重骰
*回合結束時圖板旁卡各補到三張
B 休息 3選1，從主圖版左或右棄骰區收全部骰子重骰，或是自己顏色的所有骰(可少拿)重骰
*所有完成探索卡上分數 + 生物組別分數 3/8/15/24 + 印地安人分數(比較帳篷最多的 4:12/8/4/0, 3: 12/6/0, 2: 12/6，平手分數加總平均)，分高獲勝，平手比個人圖板區骰數

At times, this is somewhat interesting.  But at most times, it becomes repetitive and dull.  Though it is a completely different game, it reminds me quite a bit of its older and bigger card driven sibling, Lewis and Clark.  And this is not a good thing.  I believe this game is competing with so many other games that do essentially the same thing (build up a small engine and decide at what point to shift focus to scoring VP's) and this game simply does not have anything unique enough to push it ahead of the multitudes.  In other words, this is a very redundant game. I suppose you could say "but this game does it with dice".  #1) I do not like the fact you don't roll the dice very often.  This is the sin that King's Forge committed.  If you want to make a dice game, make sure you let the players actually roll the dice...duh.  #2) I already have Castles of Burgndy and that does the dice/expand/score thing so much better.

RATING: 7
I'm not a big dice game guy, but I didn't find Discoveries objectionable. It's not a Yahtzee-rehash like many dice game implementations of other games are. Instead, it uses a unique-feeling mechanic where you roll dice and use as many as you want of a single symbol, saving the others for future turns. I liked the idea of being able to recruit neutral and opponent's dice, but at a higher risk--and the take-that that this entails didn't really bother me (although I couldn't tell who was winning). That said, the game didn't really seem to have a ton of depth, and aside from deciding whether to go animals or not, it's pretty much completely tactical. A good game, but it just didn't stand out.

擷取了原作Lewis & Clark跋山涉水、漢原住民交流結盟的情境，以及美麗的畫風的骰子遊戲，機制十分簡潔；要不就拿骰子做事，要不就收一些骰子回來備用，骰子使用來拿取原住民卡片以增加行動的效率或是取得被動能力，收集原住民部落標記也可以在遊戲結束時依名次拿分，完成旅程卡片可能有卡片基本分數也可能記錄珍禽異獸湊套換分，得分路線就三種很直覺、完成旅程卡片得分、珍禽異獸湊套換分、部落標名次分。遊戲規則還有一個combo的地方是若一回合完成2張旅程卡就額外再獲得一回合。
以上都是優點，但本遊戲骰運吃重，若整場骰運不好，就是會比其他玩家吃虧非常多難以追回，另外若是四人場，因為場面再輪回自己時變動已大更增加運氣成分，所以本遊戲最佳人數應該是3人。2人場還沒試過要再嘗試才能比較優缺

Light dice placement game. I enjoy it because it feels quite zen to just roll dice and decide when to place/take dice into your pool.

When you take dice, you can take all dice regardless of colour in that pool.

Another dice game. Potential to be better than I found it to be in my first play. Reward the leader- I hated the rule where if you complete something 2 paths you get another turn. If you never have the option of completing 2 then you just get screwed the whole game. If you take out the extra turn bit then it might be better. I loved the art and the mechanic of everyone's dice are everywhere and others can use them- but you run the risk of recall. Cool dice- I would play again.

The dice version of Lewis and Clark.
Beautiful artwork, a respectful historical theme that matches the mechanics of the game well (traveling, journaling, etc) and a good competitive angle in being able to use other players dice which can be taken away from you at possibly the worst times in your gameplay chain.
Recommended but need to be in the right mood to play this one.

RATING: 6
There's a very tiny engine being built in this game, but mostly it's about indirect actions, minor randomness through dice rolls, and dice optimization. No complaints there, and it does everything well. It's a good Euro. I think playing it a few more times with more than two players to get a feel for the optimal player count would also expose me to more of the game, but I'd say the weakest thing to it is that once you've got your set of tribes (which give you more available actions to spend dice on) you're mostly just trying to optimize that engine as best as possible, and so there's a certain limitation to how much growth can occur. 

Again, I have almost no real negatives about this game, but in some ways it lacks the sort of progression you might want in a game where you're building usually asymmetric and often diametrically different engines to accomplish really only one or two types of actions. I think possibly another scoring mechanism might be useful, but at the same time I think that the game is trying to have as much complexity as it can for its light weight, and I'd say it's successful.

Quick one hour game with an interesting dice pooling mechanic, you can use the spent dice of other players as long as they don't "rest" their turn. Slight luck in what kind of expedition cards come out and also if you're able to fulfill two in one go, in which case you get a powerful extra turn.

Quicker dice version of Lewis & Clark. Normally I don't really like games that involve much of dice rolling, but in Discoveries I love the way you can manipulate the dices for the actions you want to do.

Nem rossz játék, de igazából semmi extra. A cél utak felfedezése, amelyek hegyeken vagy folyókon át vezethetnek. A célkártyák közül kiválasztunk magunknak ilyen célokat, majd a kockáinkkal megdobjuk az akadályok leküzdéséhez szükséges szimbólumokat.
A játék érdekessége, hogy a kockák olyan erőforrások, amiket később vissza lehet szerezni. Nemcsak a közös, hanem a saját kockákat is. Ez utóbbiban az az érdekes, hogy ezeket akkor is visszaszerezhetjük, ha ellenfeleink birtokában vannak, és ők már éppen fel szeretnék valamire használni. A megszerzett kockákkal csak egyszer lehet dobni, és míg újradobás nem lehetséges, addig arra mód van, hogy kocka eredményét megváltoztassuk.
Én úgy érzem, hogy a könnyed játékhoz egy kicsit sok a játékidő, valamint a szerencse szerepe is talán egy kicsivel nagyobb, mint azt el lehetne várni egy kevésbé tematikus játéktól.

I was trying to put a finger on what it is about this game that made me so unhappy with it. I went into it expecting to like it because I love the subject matter and Vincent's art. 

To keep this short... Nothing makes any sense, its too long, there are too many little here and there rules and good luck teaching this to someone new to board games and expecting them to wrap their head around what the heck is going on and why. The art is beautiful but there isnt much else here. Another game that has added to my hesitation to play dice games. I have no interest in playing this again. It just never felt fun and thats why I play board games, to have a good time.

I have to say I quite enjoy it for what it is - and it's a good, fast and relatively simple eurogame with lots od dice, great artwork and interesting theme. How does it compare to "Lewis & Clark"? Well it's a different beast mechanically, but the feeling of a race was preserved very well, so in a sense both games belong to the same family. If you enjoy the predecessor, you should definitely try this one too.

Ups? The turns are quick, smart play is rewarded, there's room for strategy and it's just perfect lenght-wise. Downs? The cards are a bit random (just as the dice are), so there are moments when you might feel shafted, but it's rare and, from my experience, most of the time there's always a plan B. If you love dice and you're looking for something not too heavy, but still thinky and fast - grab this one ASAP.

Quick-playing dice game with great theme and a mechanic that really feels like it matches what you are doing in the game--recording your discoveries in your journal as you journey to the Pacific with Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery (what a great name!). So far, my only plays have been solo, but I'm looking forward to my first group play. Once learned, this can probably be played in less than an hour.

Fairly quick dice (pool) builder with a little take-that mechanic to control opponents dice pools.  I think that it really needs to be played with more than 2 players to really get the interaction going.  Only a portion of the dual-sided deck of cards get used each game to increase variability.  On top of that the cards are dual-sided, so the players never know which side will become available

RATING: 7
A bit cumbersome for a light dice game. There are a whole lot of options each turn, which is neat, but once you grab a couple indian cards and you're a few rounds into the game, your choices will become more and more obvious, and even though you'll depend less and less on the luck of the dice, you'll still be at the mercy of the random travel deck.

I actually do enjoy this game. It feels like a lighter, faster Lewis & Clark, which is exactly what I wanted, but much like L&C I'm usually tired of the game long before it is finished. Take some cards out of the deck to make it shorter and this is a much better experience.

I had high expectations for this game and it did not disappoint.  It was much more of a brain burner than I had expected especially since it has dice as a major component.  The dice are the resources but management of the dice and the faces is the key element to how this game works.  The theme actually integrate quite well as you can get the feel of going on an exploration and then writing in your journal.  The game just works.  However, as a two player it was okay but I think it shines with more.

The Good: Awesome art, components, theme, rule book. Game play is good but not great. I like the "take back dice from the board or opponents" mechanic.

The not so good: Game feels too long for what it is, seems repetitive and the engine building seems small. Feels like the game just needs a little extra something to make it really good.

Update: After another play dropped rating from 7 to 4. This is a dry euro with dice and not much interaction. I didn't like the original Lewis and Clark and I don't really like this either.

Simple dice/placement game with a twist of using other people's dice and the ability to disrupt others by taking back your own dice.  However, the game itself is boring and  there are turns with nothing interesting to do.  Would be more fun if there was more to do each turn.  Art is nice though.

underappreciated set collection game of dice worker placements and beautiful art. great girlfriend game! there's randomness, some chance for double turns, and some chance to borrow other people's resources, although it's low on "take-that" and the lucky bits can be mitigated by dice-change actions or collecting tribe upgrades. i still haven't gotten this in front of four players all at once, but i expect there would be some really interesting interactions with the dice borrowing and dice recall mechanisms. worth a try if you can find it. did i mention that all the Vincent Dutrait art was gorgeous? it's awfully pretty!

"This is a really well thought out set collection game with great mechanics that are easy to understand. The game has a great flow and is hard to master, but really satisfying. In my opinion, this blows Lewis and Clark out the water. The art is also phenomenal. This is now my number 1 game ever."

Pace is quick as players perform small incremental moves on their way to exploring and befriending natives. Reclaiming dice keeps the game interesting and interactive. Scoring is interesting with missing set cards (either out of the game or on the back of Native American tribes), making some icons very hard to come by.

Plays in less than an hour and keeps you engrossed. I like the idea of each die representing a person in a party, but overall it's just a little too stop/start and micro planning for me to love it. Perhaps it's the secure route planning part that feels a little ho hum, because the acquiring of Native American cards and their extra powers is very appealing to me. I'd have liked to have seen a different movement mechanism than just a guaranteed hop, step and jump. 

Happy to give it a roll though if people ask for it.

Despite an initial presentation of what appear to be complicated icons, a couple turns sees the game flowing quickly and nicely.

The mechanism of being able to grab and use dice/workers from other players is nice (and doesn't always lead to them being grabbed back).

Very nice art and art style, the latter reminds me of adventure books for boys.

RATING: 7
Clever dice-roller. It's not just rolling dice and putting workers on places, and I appreciate that. There's a lot to consider, and many interesting decision points. The biggest oddity is that sometimes you'll spend three turns doing one small thing in each turn in order to accomplish something. I think that's to simulate the slowness of actual exploration, but I'm not sure it translates to real life when I'm playing a game. Still, clever and I like it.

Beautiful components and good mechanics. Luck on your die rolls are mitigated by many meaningful actions you can take on your turn.

Feels distinctive amidst its peers. Not a traditional dice-as-workers placement design, but also steers clear of the frantic, Yahtzee-style re-roll fest so prevalent in the genre. Not particularly deeper or more variable than other titles, but pulls off a more cerebral play. The semi-shared dice pool, controlled mitigation of rolls and nuanced integration of theme create an interesting and unique experience.

RATING: N/A
Rolling dice is always nice, but I can see some serious king-making issues in this game. The 'take all your dice back' can really cripple a player.

Second, not being an American, the Lewis and Clarke theme doesn't grab me that much. The game itself is about set collection, with the obvious end-game bonus scoring for sets. Theme is thin, the game itself seems inferior to Roll for the Galaxy as you just play your own turn and wait for others to finish. Almost no interaction except the 'take all back' mechanism. All in all, not enough. This won't be a game I'm after.

tl;dr: fine dice game

[thing=140620][/thing] was a hit, so of course the publisher wants to cash in. And the author too I guess. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. And in this case it's not.
So the theme is more or less the same, and the artwork is more or less the same (I guess some of it is shared?) but this is not a deck building game, it's a dice game. And it's a pretty good one with nice choices. You need to use the different symbols on the dice to activate locations on your tableau to perform actions to advance towards victory.
I had a couple of streaks where I would roll anything but what I needed. Luckily there are ways around that, but at a cost. What is also nice is that there is some risk taking involved when you start using the other player's dice. This combination gives some nice tension.
Yeah, all in all a fine dice game.

I took way too long to get this to the table.  Tried it tonight and WOW!  Once the rules are learned, the turns are fast!  My wife tends to be somewhat "thinky."  Yet, her turns only took 30 seconds or so--sometimes 3 seconds!    Loved the art, the game smoothness, the plan-making, and build-up.  Very clever use of two-sided cards and implementation of theme throughout.  Did I mention the art?  I got rid of the big version of L&C because this one just works so much better.  Small footprint, short playing time and brilliant game!  There was a build-up of tension all the until the end and the scoring didn't even take  that long.  This game has no negatives for me except one.  I'm not sure if it might be a bit repetitive after a couple dozen games.  For now, my wife and I loved it!

I didn't care for VivaJava the Dice game largely because of the amount of luck, but I did like the idea of a simple dice game where you gain special abilities as the game progresses. Discoveries is all about gaining special abilities and it makes the game a lot of fun, plus the way it uses dice is really unique (unlike other games that just use a Yahtzee mechanic).

Although the mechanics are completely different, this game does capture the feel of the larger Lewis & Clark game in a couple of ways. The exploration in this game takes a lot of planning and multiple turns to accomplish, just like in L&C. The "rest" action in this game also feels similar to the "camp" action in L&C. In L&C it was a way to get your cards back into your hand and advance along the scoring track, and in Discoveries it is a way to get your dice back (or simply get more dice, if you want to take a chance).

Despite all of that, there's still a high enough level of randomness and the game just doesn't feel very fun.

Sold.

The rating is a little premature--only played once to learn, so far, two players. Very impressive treatment of the theme, the gameplay is light/medium weight with very quick turns, good length. Two player is not best for it, but it's not bad. I'll be curious to see if it gets into steady rotation for us.

A few more plays: Very pleasant, on the light side of mid-weight, but it makes a nice game to go to when you need a little variety. Staying in rotation. Nice art, wooden dice, and very quick and easy setup and take-down help it get pulled from the shelf.

This is an innovative dice sharing game that serves its theme well. There are opportunities for dice manipulation to mitigate an unlucky roll. "Borrowing" dice from your opponent means that you may lose them later if they're recalled. A nice step forward in game design.

The rule allowing someone to take an extra turn if they complete two cards at once is just awful. And yes, we were playing everything correctly - if someone has acquired some decent tribe cards it simply isn't that difficult to do and it leads to a major rich-get-richer problem. Without that rule I would rate this several points higher.

I put off buying this for some time and wish I had purchased it sooner now that I have played it. I'm really really enjoying this game. I love the theme and the way the mechanics invoke the theme is fantastic. The way a turn is broken down into small pieces and prevents you from doing everything all at once makes this game shine. Lots of interesting decisions such as which Indian tribes to befriend to help you build your engine, which expedition to choose and how to spend your dice (workers) and which ones to give up and when and how to recall dice....oh it's just brilliant! I highly recommend this game!

I like the game mechanics, especially the dice mechanic. It does however appear to be essential to acquire a set of tribe cards that work well together (i.e. cards that need similar die faces) early in the game. If you have failed to acquire a good set of tribe cards, then your chances of winning seem low. Having said that the game plays fast so this issue is not too serious: just play another game.

Lewis and Clark dice game about exploring and furthering science.  Love dice games and love the theme.  Art and components look great and it plays well with two.  The mechanic for taking back dice is interesting.

Wasn't sure how I felt about this game on my initial play.  Was a surprising amount of planning for what looks like a simple dice game.  I've thought about it a lot the week since playing and thus it has moved up in my ratings.  I'm eager to play it again, and with some more players.

Okay game, perhaps even good even though most of it feels like I've seen it before. Biggest problem is that I don't know when and with whom to play it. With seasoned players there are deeper games in the same time, with casual players it is too convoluted. So this one will likely not be seen again.

I played it a couple of times now and it is really a good game that captures the feeling of the "main game" but is very unique and elegant on it's own. I like the mechanisms of the "dice borrowing". Played it with variable playercounts and it works best with three for me

Really fun dice allocation game (i.e. worker placement with dice as workers) with beautiful artwork.

One of the more interesting aspects is that the dice/workers come in two different flavors: neutral and player-specific. Spent workers often go into common pools that can be taken by anyone, but a player can always use their turn to recall all of their own workers at any time. This makes neutral workers valuable since they can't be recalled. However, if an action gives someone a neutral worker and you have the most, you have to give them one of yours, so you often don't want to have the most. Lots of interesting dynamics here.

My only big complaint is that negotiation dice results are extremely valuable in the early game, and so the initial rolls can create a very unbalanced start. For example, if player A gets 2-3 negotiation results on the initial roll, and player B gets zero, then B player is likely to spend their first turn manually converting dice to negotiation results. This effectively puts player B one turn and one die behind player A based only on the initial roll.

Otherwise, still really liking this game after 10-15 plays.

Man, this game felt like it’s big brother Lewis & Clark, and for me that’s not good. Instead of a fun game spent moving quickly across the vast wilderness of the Louisiana Purchase, you are constantly going over your surprisingly limited options in your head, making a decision, and then realizing why that decision is a bad one.

It’s mechanics and the amount of fun I had while playing make me think this game should last an hour or so. However, the game lasted almost two hours for three players (we started with four and one left mid-game), and that’s just far too long for what it is.

This one quickly ended up in my recent auction.

Not recommended.

Did not realize what I was missing out on. I have had the game for over a year and never played it. It's fun! It looks like it will be complicated but there is so many ways to use the dice that you have many options. The art work is Fantastic! The wooden dice are well made. Buy this game.

Semi coop dice worker placement of the Lewis & Clark expedition. Each player represents an exhibition leader to discover sets of wildlife, blaze trails across mountains and rivers, and meet and negotiate with peaceful and wary tribes. Draft from dual purpose cards. Quick turns placing the dice of one result type from the pool. Some innovative dice action spaces can set up big move combos.  I like the negotiation mechanic with the tribes to gain neutral workers, and leverage dice. Taking other players resting dice is an interesting interactive risk-reward component.

Wow, what a quick-playing gem of a dice game. Our first play took 90 minutes as we double-checked the rulebook a few times, but after that our games have flown by in 45 mins to maybe an hour. Excellent artwork, and for a dice game it isn't fully luck-based. It's a keeper.

Comment after one play:

I had really high hopes for this game. It has a really engaging theme and it looks fantastic. Unfortunately, the gameplay does not in any way convey the feeling of exploration and discovery; it feels more like a set of mechanics have been assembled to make a game that could have been about anything. The dice add very little; cards probably would have been a better choice to add some variety and randomness to the game (after all exploration is a risky activity where any number of unexpected or unanticipated things can happen). Overall I was disappointed, as the idea of exploring beyond the Mississippi and discovering people, animals and plants was really appealing to me.

A dice allocation game based on Lewis & Clark... Timing and set collection with dice pools that can grow and shrink as players use their own and other players dice... Quite cool and very enjoyable!

This was a lot more interesting than I had suspected. It is a thinky dice game. However, I suspect that it's sadly best as a two player game, because the down time can be too much. Sometimes you've plotted out your four next moves, and your turns take one second, but then the next player needs five minutes to figure out how to complete a second Journal Map entry. It's brutal!

Discoveries is a colourful, portable light resource management game, independent from language. It has a little of dice allocation/worker placement mechanic. Like Voyages of Marco Polo and Grand Austria Hotel, you throw and allocate dice to perform an action. Like Splendor, is an engine building, so you build your tableau (here come the combos). You win points on three victory conditions: Biodiversity, Geography and Diplomacy (Unofficial terms). 

It is played in about 35 minutes for 2 players. Rules are easy to pick up, however, the iconography is less intuitive in tribe cards. However, it is less engaging than thought; either thematic players , either strategic players will be disapointed. For a less than 60 min of play you should give it a try.

This is a pretty cool dice-rolling game that does have more meat on the bone than I first thought. Assigning dice, recalling them and stringing together combos makes for a relaxing but still thinky experience. It's a surprisingly satisfying game that plays quickly, and the artwork is great.

A Lewis&Clark vonalat el kell felejteni, semmi köze hozzá a rajzokon kívül. Így elsőre kockapóker, mondjuk annak gyönyörű az előbbi okok miatt. Nyilván vannak célok és az egymástól rablás sem rossz, de vmi hiányzik talán belőle. Sztem egy játék még van benne nekem, aztán vagy megszeretem vagy soha többet kategória.

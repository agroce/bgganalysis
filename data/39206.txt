Another game that hits the table equally well with muggles and gamers alike, although its quite a mess.  The game suffers, though, when one person takes a big lead and then refuses to take any serious actions on his/her turn.  House rules help this, which are easier to implement with the golden axe/core promo.

A simple game that probably will be the starting point for my son in time to come. I like the interlocking system of the bark to the trunk of the tree.

Not a serious game but a good filler when everyone's brain is fried after one of the more heavier games. A better version of Jenga in my opinion.

This is Jenga trying to disguise itself as something better.  In this game you try to tap a piece of tree trunk just hard enough so the bark will fall off but not the trunk itself.  It can lead to some exciting turns as players luck into a really good tap that nets them a lot of bark.  However the tree becomes too precarious, so after a little while someone will bring 90% of it crashing down.  So, although the winner is supposed to be the one with the most bark, it feels more like Jenga where the winners are the people who didn't bring the trunk crashing down.  Even worse is when a player only brings about 50% of the trunk down, and then they are forced to continue playing despite the fact that they have no chance to win.  Finally, I find the setup a little too tedious.  Sometimes it can take longer to setup than it does to play.  Yet there is some fun in playing the game, so I won't really resist playing.

During the 1st couple of games I thought "It's OK - a cute party game". But when we finally put the game away (2.5 HOURS LATER!!!) I realized that this game has totally fired Jenga. The game can be a lite party game or a serious nail biting challenge. This is one of the best fillers I've ever played.

RATING: 6.4
Simple dexterity game, in fact almost identical to Bling Bling Gemstone so just read my comments for that.

Rules changes from Bling Bling: all bark is one point and wood rounds are negative five.

Parts change: Full ax instead of a pick ax. Also the center rounds seem to not slide at all. You'll need to give it a good whack, and so you'll have less control.

*Also does not work as greatly when combined with Bling Bling to makes a super huge tower. The tower is just too tall and with the not budging plastic wood centers it's easy to over tap and take negative a billion in one swing. It's also twice the setup time.

RATING: 5
[i]5 plays.
2, 3, & 4 players.[/i] 

[thing=39206][/thing] is a silly dexterity from Korea, released at Essen this year.  It was a great way to kill time between longer games at the convention.  It also seemed that everyone wanted to try it at least once, so it was an easy game for groups of players unfamilar with each other to reach agreement on.  

The point of the game is to strike a large plastic tree with plastic axes.  If the outer bark falls off, you get points.  Hit the tree too hard, however, and you will knock off chunks of the core (or, worse, topple several core pieces). Core pieces substantially detract from your score.  As the game progresses, the opportunities for obtaining bark become rarer and the tree becomes increasingly precarious.  It ends up feeling a bit like [thing=2452]Jenga[/thing], but this is not a bad thing. The tension created as the tower threatens to topple leads to a lot of hilarity from a game that asks little of its players.  This is especially true at two or three in the morning.  

Most of our sessions also mixed in [thing=112355][/thing] and [thing=112356][/thing].  These expansions are not stricktly necessary, but they do provide some alternative ways of thinking about the game.  I think I prefer the purity of the base game, personally.

All in all I enjoyed [thing=39206][/thing]. It is more of a child's game than a grown-up game. But, as we learned with [thing=327][/thing], this has never stopped adults from having a childlike fun. This is not the type of game that I normally rate, so I can't give you a number here. My rating system simply does not encompass such things.  But, for what it is, I give the game high marks.  It should also win the award for most entertaining tie-breaker in a game: the winning players are instructed to see who can balance the plastic axe in their palm the longest.  Most of the time, players wanted to attemt the tie-breaker even when the game was not tied.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun family game which plays like Jenga with an axe.  You take the very cool plastic axe and try and chop off pieces of the tower without knocking out the center pieces.  Challenging and fun.

While it's a blast, it is a novelty game and can't be played very often if you wish to avoid getting bored with it.

What a riot! I had vaguely heard of this game, but I own my fair share of family dexterity games. One play that took all of 2 minutes convinces me though that this might be worth picking up. Just a simple fun time of using a plastic axe to try and chop off bits do bark without knocking out major sections of the tree. More difficult than it sounds!

Update: I've now played this game with 2 or 3 different groups, and it has gone over extremely well. It's a blast. And you can try to simply score points from bark, or create a precariously leaning tree for the next sorry sap... what's surprising is that there really is skill involved.

This one is a keeper in the collection and one of the best dexterity games I've run across.

Perhaps one of the better dexterity games. I think I like the simplicity of its scoring and its theme makes more sense than Bling Bling Gemstone, but The variety that Bling Bling brings is just a little better. Still, no way I'll turn down a game of this.

Every collection needs a kids/dexterity game that adults can play when drinking (or even when not!), and this is our choice.  It is surprisingly difficult to play, and always leads to some great stories, some horrible accidents, and some amazing chops.

A great dexterity game that keeps everyone on their toes. You find out what kind of touch you really have when you play this game. Unique enough from Jenga that it won't replace it, but it will give you the same kind of tension when you're about to hit the tower, and the same kind of relief and victory when a piece of bark falls off a trunk piece without knocking the whole thing over. Wonderful party game, especially for non-gamers.

Players are lumberjacks, trying to chip bark off a tree, without felling the trunk.  Hilarious, totally insane dexterity game.  Players take turns to tap a plastic tree twice with a large plastic axe, trying to dislodge the small bark pieces.  Each piece that hits the table is worth one victory point.  The bark is attached to the nine trunk pieces, which can easily slide off the base and hit the table - and these are negative five victory points.  Fun game, literally for all ages, with some surprisingly subtle strategy.  Instant hit in our household.

Too little of a game here to interest me. The games I played rarely lasted more than a couple of minutes. And we found that if player one smashes the lot down in their first turn, the end the game and win as the only person scoring! Kinda broken (rules didn't account for this scenario).

This game is elegant in its simplicity, with rules that take less than 30 seconds of explanation, and intuitive game play that isn't too easy to master. Judging this as a family-friendly dexterity game, which is what it is, it is a resounding success. However, don't look to this game for any strategy or deep decision making.

Silly, silly dexterity game.  I had previously thought this was one that I probably should own, but after playing it, I think I'm good without it.  It was fun enough, but the randomness of judging how far the plastic cores will slide seems pretty pointless.

RATING: 4
I am an amazing lumberjack apparently I fell trees with a single blow ... unfortunatly the point of this game is not to knock down the tree but just remove the bark. 

Interesting activity but there is not all that much game here. I think it will go down better in a party setting or with groups of children.

Generally it takes longer to set this up than it does to play it.

Dexterity game that is okay to play once in awhile with children or for some adult laughs.  It only lasts 5 minutes so a few games went by quickly and we were onto something else.

I legitimately lost a game to my three-year old today.  Not like I screwed up and knocked it over early - we're talking five to six rounds where she consistently kept pace with me and then I knocked the tower over.  I give it a 10 as a kids game.  

As an adult game, it's a great 5 minute filler.  There's really a lot of room for skillful chops and the two expansions add little extra to your decisions here and there which keeps the game a little fresher than it might otherwise be after so many plays.

Actually, this played out much better than I was thinking. It's a pretty lame-brain dexterity game, but at least there is tension: as much as one might find in Knockout or something similar. Unfortunately, it is one of those games where a player might end up with so many negative pieces that they know they will be losing in a bad way regardless of what more they do. Still, for a 10-minute game, it was satisfactory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not bad for a kids game. Very cute theme. Just wasn't super interesting and suffered from run away leader syndrome pretty badly. Every round 'ended' with the one player with positive points half-way through essentially skipping his turns as no one else would reasonably pass him as long as he didn't gain negative points.

Ok, so it's not a Martin Wallace game, but there is something to it.  It's much better than most other dexterity games in that it looks amazing and is a hoot to play.  My 2.5 year-old loves swinging the axe!  My only gripe is that it can take forever to set up in comparison to how long the game actually lasts.

As a game for young gamers, this is fantastic.  I can also see it being a hit with adults as a filler.

A kid friendly game where they act like a lumberjack. The pieces are slippery so it takes some practice for younger players to hit the bark just right without knocking over too much at once. It is a little tedious setting it up and can be frustrating when you hit too hard and too many pieces fall but for younger players it is worth the cost.

+ Knock off one of the central bark pieces? EVERYONE GETS A QUESTION.
+ Knock off a few central back pieces? EVERYONE HAS TO INTRO WITH 3/4 STATEMENTS.

Also if the game's taking too long I can just chop far too hard and send the tree crashing to the ground...Game over.

Loud, exciting, dumb fun that will have everyone hooting and hollering. What's ingenious about it is the need to get those bark pieces without knocking the core pieces down... that adds just enough skill to the game to make it interesting.

This game is little beyond the light dexterity game that it presents itself as, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a fun little opener or filler game to play with anyone. As opposed to Jenga, the game doesn't just end as soon as someone screws up (unless they really messed up), allowing for tension and big laughs to continue throughout the short games.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2014)

I spent a lot of time looking for this game. For some reason, I thought it was called Tiki Mountain, so I bought that game by mistake :D. Click Clack Lumberjack is obviously a Jenga derivative, however it is very fun and fast to play. You can explain t under one minute. If the game were longer, I would dislike the grubs variant, but as the game is so short I don´t mind. Good components. 

For now, I don’t have anything bad to say about the game, perhaps the setup time can be long VS. the time it takes to play the game. My copy came with 5 missing pieces, I will contact Mayday soon about this. 

For now, it is a keeper in my collection. Fun dexterity game. My GF loves it.

This is a fun dexterity game, but pretty difficult.  More often than not, you'll wind up with a negative score.  Or maybe I'm just terrible at it.  In any case, it's a good amount of fun.  The worst part of the game is building it back up to play again!

Better Jenga. Simple, silly fun. Great for play at parties/while drinking. Only problem is setup takes SLIGHTLY longer than I like but that's the nature of the game. Very low-skill but very fun for what it is. As much toy as game (in a good way). can end a little quickly if it's your main activity.

As close to Looping Louie in terms of fun as a game can get. It's only drawback is the comparably long setup time in relation to playtime. There's a bit more skill involved here which might raise the minimum age for children by a year.

RATING: 7
A fun idea for a game, only downside is the setup, which is a little more involved than most.  Also, it seems like this would fall prey to the problem with a lot of stacking games - the one that makes things fall is out of it.  Most of the trunk falls I've seen have been multiple pieces at a time, which pretty much eliminates a player.  Luckily, it's short enough that that's okay.  I almost wonder if it would be better if a player just quits in that situation to force the remaining competitive players to battle it out.

RATING: 8
Hilarious, nonsensical Korean dexterity game where you're trying to hit the bark off the a tree that's made of these disks with the bark stuck into slots. (Because of course lumberjacks only really want the bark...) You get two tries (toc toc!) per turn, and a point for every piece of bark you get, and lose 5 points for every piece of the tree's core that gets knocked off. It's a really simple, hilarious closer that I can see wanting to play over and over, particularly with 2p - with more I can imagine it being (amazingly) less strategic. As it stands you sort of want to hit some stability into the core with your first toc and dislodge bark with the second, but there are times when you can only do one or the other, Jenga-like. I don't always go in for this kind of thing, but Toc Toc Woodman's a lot of fun.

Very simple dexterity game whereby players tap sections of tree trunk in order knock off pieces of bark.  This is pretty bad but could be somewhat remotely entertaining for three minutes of your life if you really take your time and try to avoid knocking over the tree.  Otherwise, the tree falls quickly and the game ends quickly.  Very quickly.  There are plenty of silly dexterity games which are dumb but fun nonetheless and are worthwhile owning for some wacky fun.  This is not one of them.

Okay 30+ games in a little over 2 weeks merits a comment

We came up with a ruleset of our own. something that the game encourages.

Every brown outer piece is worth a point. 
In a two player game you need 14 of those
In a 3 player game 9.

If you have three inner pieces of the tree you automatically loose.

If you have an inner piece in your possesion it counts as -5. (you have to fill it up)

If one player loses the player with the most points at that time wins.

In case someone loses (3 inner pieces dropped) before one player had a turn in a game. that player won't take part in the restart of the game. (this is simething taken from original rules)


It's more fun than jenga. It's way more silly and quicker




I got toc toc woodman here but the comment is about cupeed 

It has great components. The gameplay is great and it can be brutal as well.

Object of the game is to make  3*3 squared cubed. You do this by playing cards to acquire the pieces. some pieces are the same but the cubes also contains different pieces. And since your cube won't be made with pieces of the same colour it will be very challenging.

There are snatch cards that allow ou to pick a piece from your opponent or switch (which allows you to take a piece of your opponent and give him a piece, you don't need.
There is a refusal cards which stops that.

The guy explaining it to me said it could become addictive and I believe him after 10 minutes.

I rate the game a 7 because I am not a puzzle fan. If I were a puzzle fan it would be in my top 10 for sure. 

Great game. (Cubeed)




They also sold peepers.
A plastic version in a long box with great art. and a deluxe version for just 30 euro's.
Peepers is soundless though. I thought it made a sound. But there is braille on the stones for those with lesser sight.

I'm amazed by this game and how much it screws with people.  Someone you really thing will be great at it, just smacks the thing and knocks it over.  Great game for a laugh, for younger players, or the to help that need to smack something with an axe.

Improved Zenga. And a pretty good one. I use my own scoring system for the game though, and imo it makes it much better. 

- Each bark falls off is 1 point.
- Each bark falls off is -1 point, if the core falls off also. 
- First woodman gets his point divided by 2, rounded up (only the first whole turn).

Silly fun.  Swing an axe to try and shake loose the bark but not the actual timber.  Say what?  How does that make any thematic sense?  Who knows, but the game is actually decent and fairly fun.  I could see this being a fun opener at a gameday as people wait for others to arrive or a late night closer.  However, the experience can be soured if someone decides just to end their misery and chop down the rest of the tree...just a fair warning!

Bought off Amazon for Uncle Ron's family for '14 Christmas.  Would probably be a great game for the little one, just because.  But it's a fun dexterity game regardless, like Jenga, but faster and more exciting, less foreboding.  Knock off the bark without hitting off the core.  Works for 6 players or so, hopefully they'll like it.

Cody has it, it's pretty great to have in the group.

I like this game, but I'm more likely to suggest other dexterity games over it (Klask for 2p, Loopin Louie for 4p).  However, Click Clack Lumberjack works well for a larger number of people, and it is pretty unique.  I'll say that this game is one of the funnier dexterity games I've played... nothing better than someone barely tapping it, getting nothing, then the next person sending the whole tree crashing down :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Delicately chip pieces of a plastic tree off an ever unstable stacked core.

Played as: 2,3,4,6 players

Pros: True to a dexterity game, people can't look at the game without wanting to take a couple whacks at it. Cute components make the game ridiculous (in a good way) to see in play. There's something just so satisfying about the game whether it's the "tink-tink" sound of the ax or watching little plastic pieces fall loose from the tree.

Cons: There's a fine balance of force and finesse required to not just be good at the game, but to keep it from ending in the first couple turns. The later part is a hurdle that new players need to get over and unfortunately the game can take longer to set up than play during these times. In a word, I'd call it unforgiving. Probably too much so for kids which someone might think it would be a good target audience for.

Other: I love bringing this game out to unsuspecting folks and watch the range of reactions from head-shakes to laughter. But once it's set up, it's offered universal enjoyment for small bursts of time. There are some tack on rules that are a little bit of a waste but easy enough to leave out.

Best Use: A fairly quick dexterity filler to get everyone in a light mood.

My 4 year old niece really loved this game so I am a sure this game will be handy when young children come to visit.  As far as a game which can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike, I am not sure this is it.

If you tried to play this game competitively, the game might deadlock after everyone realizes striking the tree again will likely bring down a -5 trunk piece and little bark.  The rules don't prevent a player from essentially passing their turn.

Crazy dexterity/party game with a similar feel to Loopin' Louie in terms of the fun it can evoke. 

Toc Toc is essentially a more engaging version of Jenga as the player attempt to knock bark off a tree using a plastic axe. The components are very well designed and the fun comes in the form of under and over hitting the tree to either frustrate the players or see the tree go sprawling, which costs a player bad points.

A silly little dexterity game where you want to hit the tree hard enough to get the little bark pieces off the wood for 1 pt each...but be careful, if you knock the whole wood piece off its -5 pts!  oh, and you whack this tree with the coolest little axe.  

A have a very close Korean friend, and when I saw on the box, 'a Korean game something ruther', AND my friend is a HUGE dexterity game fan...I had to get it, and its good fun for the time investment!

Das bessere Jenga. Hier kann man weiterspielen, auch wenn ein paar Steine hinabfallen. Und dadurch, dass die Axtschläge unkontrollierter sind als das Ziehen von Jengasteinen, entstehen bei Click Clack Lumberjack lustigere Momente.

A game of strategic mastery and tactical guile! No, not really... More a game for small children, or adults supplied with hop and malt related beverages

Construct a plastic tree-trunk from a pile of slippery disks, each with loose skin of bark. Gently belt the tree with a plastic axe (provided), hoping to dislodge the bark without knocking out the centre disks, or indeed, toppling the whole thing.

Drink. Retrieve pieces from under the table next to you, where people are playing Agricola and would clearly prefer to be playing Toc Toc Woodman. Assemble the tree again, get ready to catch it when Phil has his go.

It is cheap, silly fun, and very well made (really).

Played twice with wife and 6 year old. Requires more skill than initially thought. Decisions include which column to hit, how hard to hit and whether to risk it or just gently tap and pass. Had a fun time once the tower drops and it is a no-brainer to go for another round.

I have a second edition.  One of my biggest complaints is with the box.  My second biggest complaint is somewhat superficial, but when I purchase a copy of Click Clack and get a golden axe for Toc Toc (the name is physically molded on the axe), I am a little frustrated.  That all said, as a dexterity game in the vein of Jenga, it's a lot of fun.  It's surprising how little it takes to knock a tree segment out.  Definitely one to keep around to play with the kids.

RATING: 6
A stupid little dexterity game that is of course great fun for the 1 and a half minutes it takes to play. Then like Kerplunk, it takes longer to set up (getting it all stacked up) then it takes to play. The tree is made up of 10 or so core segments, each with 4 pieces of plastic bark around its outer side. The aim is to tap a segment hard enough so it's pushed outside the edge of the segments below it, just enough so that the bark pieces slide down and off it, but not so hard that all the segments above it fall off. Bark good for points. Segments bad. Take turns whacking the thing, aiming your axe most judiciously. Most points win. Not much of a game, but fun for a few minutes.

Again, this was rated by my niece age 10-13.   The game works well for 5 and older.  We played two adults and one child.   This is only for quick play, as the players got tired of it after 2 plays, but is really easy to learn and can help with basic math.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on one play: A fun concept, like Jenga with a hammer. Try to make the side pieces fall off, without knocking the whole tree over. The games are short and fun, but without the lengthy build up of most games of the type, which is actually a bad thing as the game tends to end too quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Silly, mindless fun.  I like it as a refinement on the whole Jenga style of play.  There's something satisfying about thwacking the bark with your axe that's more fulfilling than grabbing and placing pieces of wood; perhaps because it's strictly destructive?

Whatever it is, it's one of my favorite dexterity games.

A very simple dexterity game but lots of fun for all ages.  You are a lumberjack (like your father before you)but you are only interested in the bark of the tree!  Plastic bark pieces are added to a central core and then these are stacked to make a tree.  On your turn you get 2 swings of the axe trying to knock off only the bark.  Different colored bark is worth varying points but watch out for the bugs on certain pieces.  Keep the core intact because if you knock these pieces off they will subtract from your score.  I have had fun with kids and adults!

Pros:
1. Different. I have not played a dexterity game like this before. It's not stacking or balancing. You are removing pieces, which is sort of like Jenga, but you're doing it with a little toy axe.
2. Quick. This is a light fun dexterity game that plays in less than 10 minutes and takes less than 5 minutes to set up.
3. Fun. This is just a fun game to play while having a couple of beers with your friends before you bring out your longer games.
4. Cheap. You can get this game for less than $25.

Cons:
1. Big Loser. The majority of the time you will have one player who loses with large negative points, while everyone else is vying for a win with only 3 or 4 points.
2. Longevity. You can't break this game out every week. It's fun to break out to play a few times every couple of months. You burn out fast on this game.

Summary: Fun little dexterity game. I like this a great deal more than Bausack or Jenga. I love that this game takes only a few minutes to set up and play. This converts to a drinking game very easily. Fun game, that I will likely add to my collection as my go to dexterity (non-flicking) game.

Jogo insólito e muito original, embora nos faça lembrar “A Torre do Inferno – Jenga” numa primeira observação. Cada jogador é um lenhador em busca da melhor cortiça, a qual, aos poucos, vai caindo; o pior é que nem sempre se retira apenas cortiça e cada pedaço de tronco que caia vale 5 pontos negativos. É giro e muito divertido, o típico jogo para toda a família, que eleva o estilo “destreza” a novos patamares. Obrigatório!

A fun variation on a jenga-like dexterity game. The best way to play this is 2p or two teams of two. The game really feels like it gravitates toward having a winner and a loser, the points system is best just a tie breaker for rounds when you can't push the tree far enough to cause a collapse. I like this one.

Because the game is "physically" played, and not an abstract game, it's the first game I tried to play with my 20-month-old son.

I even managed to explain to him that the core parts were "not good", and he learned to say "Oh no!" whenever one fell out of the tree :-)

OK dexterity party game where players use a plastic axe to knock/tap/hit a plastic tower of tree pieces. The idea is to score points by chipping off brown wood pieces (four to each section of a trunk) and avoid knocking down the core tree pieces.

Fun...for 10 minutes then slowly outstays its welcome. Good filler but nothing more. The setup is cumbersome compared to dexterity fillers such as Loopin' Louie as four smaller bark pieces needs to be attached to each trunk piece prior to being stacked.

Not much to say here. This is an unusual dexterity game, where you try to knock pieces (bark) off the main structure without knocking off the core elements (trunk). It works OK, and plays quickly, but nobody at my house gets excited over it.

[Kickstart 2016 edition] {Wood; dexterity; optimal 4p} Click Clack Lumberjack is a funny toy.  My daughters like it much because they can occasionally win.  The special feature of this game is that Adults don't have ready advantages as other dexterity games with more stable hands.

It's fun to watch the whole tree falling down :)

The game components are good.  It looks like real things and the plastic pieces have good friction.  It will be better if the axes are heavier, and the worms are craved with the barks.  It's quite troublesome to build the game :P

The Kickstarter golden pieces looks good.  It is nice to have them.

5/12/2013 Still annoyed by the Clack Clack Lumberjack name - especially since mine says TOK TOK WOODMAN!

8/7/2012 I think this is a game that should be paired up with Pitch Car and Loopin Louie...just to show games don't have to be TOO serious or TOO difficult but at the same time YES despite their Kid theme...can be just as amazing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[thing=39206][/thing] is a light dexterity game in which players use a toy axe to hit a tree - the purpose is to show control: this is a challenge for the lumberjacks - any of them can hit a tree and put it down. But only the best of them can take out the bark of a tree without ever hitting its core!

Therefore, you will hit the tree in order to make the bark pieces fall, but the core stay in the tree. Of course the core is divided into pieces, so they dance around, making the balance of the whole thing more and more unyielding.

In his turn, the player have two hits to give. Even the slightest touch will count as a hit. For every bark, the player will gain 1 point (two if it has a worm), if the players makes a core fall, every piece of core will give minus 5 points for the player.

The game ends when all the barks have fallen from the tree. The player with the most points, wins!

The production value for [thing=39206][/thing] is high: the pieces are sturdy enough to withstand a lot of "punishment" - most of the times the bark pieces (and even the core pieces) would fall of the table, but they resisted this fine. No worries here (except losing the pieces, of course).

A whole play can last anytime from 5 minutes to around 15, it all depends on how careful people are in hitting the tree.

[thing=39206][/thing] is a fine dexterity game, much in the vein of [thing=2452][/thing], but with a little less control (the use of the toy axe seemed to throw people a little more off the mark). I do like [thing=2452][/thing] better, however, since I'm not a fan of the scoring in [thing=39206][/thing] - it take a lot of the emotion and, also, it can be "gamed". I explain: when the score is 6 to -8, you know that you already probably lost - a comeback if unsual (more often the player ahead will hit too hard and make one or more cores to fall). Also, I seem people that basically took himself off the game when winning with a fine margin - they would hit the tree only for show (really softly) and would only try to get more barks if one or more of them were in an easy position to be taken. Sure, maybe this last one only happen when people are vying more for the win than for the fun of the thing, but still can happen. In [thing=2452][/thing] you will always have to take out one of the pieces - so the challenge is always there.

RATING: 4
A dexterity game that quickly overstays its welcome and has limited replayability. Sure, it can be fun to use a miniture plastic axe to hit the tree bark for the first, and maybe second time. But, it is equally frustrating when a misplaced hit causes the entire structure to collapse, thus ending the game prematurely. What is the point of this futile exercise?

I've got what is referred to as the "2nd edition"- the title on the package is actually "Toc Toc Woodman".

It definitely has a Jenga feel, but the visual/tactile appeal of the tree and using an axe puts it a notch above that in my book, especially as a party game.

I was very surprised with just how fun this game is.  It's like a much better take on Jenga.  Little things like the golden bark and grubs granting free turns really add a little something.

My complaints are that one over-zealous chop can just decide the match instantly.  -5 on the Cores may be a bit much, especially -10 on the gold Core.   Also, it takes way too long to setup in between plays.

Click Clack lumberjack edition, with the grubs.

A group of friends get together to play an "unofficial world championship" which may improve my opinion of this game unduly, but it's still a fun abstraction of Jenga. Very well produced, though the earlier packaging is a little flimsier than I would like

I only really play this with the aforementioned group of friends - dropping my rating based on this

There's a lumberjack who kills a family of scrawny witches in L. Frank Baum's Oz series (book three), but [i]Toc Toc[/i] appears to be only a loose adaptation of that beloved literary classic.

As an amazing coincidence, in my last game, I managed to lose my grip on the mini-axe and behead the host.  Wow, did that cause a lot of screaming.  What a bunch of babies.

And technically I [i]did[/i] win the game.  Eliminated players aren't eligible for victory - at least according to the email exchange that I had with the designer.

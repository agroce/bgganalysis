Κάθε παίκτης έχει ένα σακούλι με ζάρια. Στη γύρα σου τραβάς μερικά ζάρια, τα ρίχνεις και ανάλογα με το τι έφερες μπορείς να αγοράσεις νέα (καλύτερα) ζάρια. Τα νέα αυτά ζάρια αναπαριστούν διάφορα πλάσματα (δράκοι,undead,troll από τον κόσμο του DnD) Σκοπός είναι με τα πλάσματα σου να κάνεις επίθεση στον αντίπαλο και να τον σκοτώσεις πριν αυτός προλάβει να κάνει το ίδιο σε σένα.

Ουσιαστικά δηλαδή μιλάμε για ένα deck building παιχνίδι με ζάρια αντί για κάρτες, που έχει ένα σύστημα μάχης σε στυλ Magic The Gathering. Το παιχνίδι κυλά γρήγορα και έχει αρκετές επιλογές του στυλ ποιο ζάρι/τέρας να αγοράσω; Να κάνω επίθεση ή να κρατήσω αμυντικούς; Μου έκανε εντύπωση που δεν βρήκα τρόπο να μπορώ να αφαιρέσω ζάρια από το σακούλι μου.

Να σημειώσω πως το παιχνίδι είναι συλλεκτικό, άρα αγοράζεις boosters με τυχαία ζάρια. Επίσης πρέπει να αγοράσεις και σακούλια για τα ζάρια. Καλό θα ήταν να εκτυπώσεις και ένα player mat. Θέλω να πω πως το βασικό πακέτο έχει ελλείψεις. Τα ζάρια από την άλλη είναι καλής ποιότητας μεν αλλά θα τα ήθελα λίγο πιο μεγάλα για να διαβάζω καλύτερα τα νούμερα.


Αξιόλογο παιχνίδι. Απλό, γρήγορο, διασκεδαστικό. Μεγάλη ποικιλία και replayability.

It's impressive to see that this isn't just a reskin of Marvel. A lot of thought went into the development so the new, added mechanics make it feel a lot like Dungeons & Dragons. Some awesome new global abilities, and the fact that you can "level up" is genius. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good fun and different from Quarriors, although after a few plays I think I prefer Quarriors, especially with the collectible nature of this game. Choosing random cards does not work well, which is a shame, it's more geared towards tailoring your deck. Huge luck on dice rolling though - no characters is a problem.

Another endless, no real decision dice roller. Take the combat mechanism out of a Dungeon and Dragon crawl and you have this game. This is for people who don't like boardgames. Remove all of the decisions, options to get you to the point of this, rerolling combat crap. And it doesn't even fulfill that, gee you KO them eventually back into the bag? This is for those Magic freaks. It is overly expensive for what it is and Whizkids has proven you can pasted any theme on it. What theme it may have just melts away into a mind numbing Yahtzee yank off. Look up circle jerk boardgames, you will find this game. Absolutely boring. The only good thing is it is 2 players.

Of the series this is the most playable and I would think they could expand it, but, gee.

Although it would be nearly impossible for them to really capture the wide range of character choices and creatures of the D&D game within the DiceMasters medium, this is actually a pretty neat set, which is second only to DC from what I can tell thus far. A few of the dice with stuff like alignments will work best with or against others in this same set, but they do integrate fairly seamlessly with the superhero DiceMasters too. Want a Beholder to team up with your Darkseids and Doctor Dooms? Go for it.

Quite enjoyable version of the game. Much better than the Marvel version previous to it. The addition of new keywords such as experience and breath weapon makes the game exciting. Theme definitely suits this game better. Balance is quite good from the starter pack but obviously for more variety foil packs should be bought (approx. 20 recommended). Can be played solo with an AI and campaign found within the bgg site that is mostly enjoyable.

Cutting thru the hype.

OK, never play Magic or any of this series. Picked this up on a whim and a few booster packs. Was rather shocked at the card quality, the bents in the booster cards are understandable given 2 dice are thrown in, but the thinness in the cards is a bit much. Come on. Baseball cards are thicker. The checklist card is useless and just token. The font is forced small to fit one paper thin card. Here is a clue, print it over 2 paper thin faux cards next time. 

The text on the cards is difficult to read across the table, even in front of you, because of the font size and frankly a white blank background for the text would have been better. The Golbal red text is next to impossible with cheap Magic Ulta Pro sleeves, that red was a stupid choice.

The dice seem of good quality but an odd smaller size then normal, most likely because of the amount needed and having to be bagged, no complaints really with them. 

The rule book needs a rewrite, they seem to just clone it forward, clobbering in rule changes, it needs to be printed in a bigger format.  As is, it is designed to fit the small package. I can't read the think. I printed off a pdf.

The paper mat is a joke. Gee they changed the rules but refuse to update the chessy template for a playmat? The dice bags are a joke. 

Unless this is a lifestyle, you have others local to trade with this, isn't worth the money needed to get anywhere near a complete set. You need 4 dice for most of the 4 or less cost cards. The high price 3 dice per card will do. This in itself is pricey and what drives the cost up. This game needs to offer more in just the starter set via of adding in additional dices. 

You can easily drop $100 on this and still feel like you are missing 25 percent of the game.

For what you get out of this, not worth the cost. Needs to be offered in a tin as a set. As is, cash cow.

I love the theme more than other dicemasters but also this plays more like magic than the other dice masters.  It feels like there is a lttle more strategy, when to attack and when to save form blockers.  The "spell" cards in the superhero dice masters was very unthematic.  In the D and D world spells are much more thematic.  This is the best game so far using the dice for character mechanism.

Love it for the D&D theme...  a bit sad about it not integrating 100% with the other sets (some effects and keywords seem to be quite specific to this set).

RATING: 5
Besides all,
1. The rules are poorly written. Special "thank you!" goes to user FAQs on BGG.
2. The game lacks game components. Have to get life counters (dice? some counters? paper&pencil?), game tokens for various effects ("experience") and dice bags (those that come with the game are just nasty) somewhere.
3. The game is designed with the "hidden goal" of purchasing additional sets asap.
4. Has NOTHING to do with D&D. Just nothing.
As for gameplay,
It's a try to make something BIG out of Quarriors. I think it's a failed try. Sophisticated, dull, bad balanced, boiled in odd randomness. Better to stay with Quarriors.

For me this is the best iteration of Dice Masters - If I'd known they were going with this theme at some point I may have skipped Avengers/X-Men.

It plays really well and I like the experience buffs for the adventurer characters v. the awesome, but hard to get to the table, power of the dragons - plus all of the beasties in between.

Game play is great and thematically this one makes a bit more sense than some of the others - if they expand this I will buy some more.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2015)

I like Dice Masters, but this one is the best set I have played (I have only played AvX and Uncanny X-men). I love the D&D theme and I think a lot of my enjoyment comes from attacking with a Beholder while a friend is defending with a Green Dragon :D.

The art is very cool (superior to previous sets) and the level up mechanism makes thematic sense. 

On a personal level I abandoned MtG a long time ago and now I feel I’m relapsing with Dice Masters. I really hate random distribution boosters, but I can attest it is very effective as I have the urge to buy more to complete the set. I’m not sure about the power level of the rare and super rare cards, but I would think they are very powerful, so if I want to play competitively I would need to get them. This is a hate/love relationship for me. 

I don’t plan to play in tournaments (there are none in my country even if I wanted to) but I read there are some tournament exclusive cards. That’s a very negative point for me as I don’t have any chance to pick them up at a reasonable price.

Bottom line, my favorite Dice Masters set by far, now I have to complete the set :/. I wish this wasn’t a collectible game but I guess it makes much more money for Wizkids this way. I really dig the LCG format from FFG and if Wizkids used it I surely would buy all the expansions for the game.

Yes, it's another 2p duelling game. But this one probably plays faster than all the others in my collection, is easiest to solo and good fun.
Lots of dice rolling of course ;)

The collectible aspect is pretty horrible though. 2 dice per booster sounds good... but you really do want 4 of every kind. The cards can be printed off if you really don't get the epics and stuff but yeah. Would've been more fun to get one card with 2 of the same die per booster.

Really smart version of dice masters.  The leveling up concept works really well.  The fact that I don't have an emotional connection to the DnD theme saved me a lot of money because I don't own this set, but mechanically I really enjoyed playing it.

RATING: 5
Interesting mix of Magic The Gathering and Quarriors.  A shame, it is only for 2 players, but you can find your own team rules also like we did once in M:TG also when it was a pure 2-player-game ;-) Still, Quarriors is superior, there you have more the instant-deckbuilding feeling, here it is more a prepared deck. While you can easily play Quarriors with random cards/dice selection, this is not true with Dice Masters - you HAVE to prepare a deck (or play it with the rules of Quarriors). That is the biggest weakness for casual plays. And there is not so much the feeling of devolping your deck during play.

Very entertaining dice chuckling 1on1 game. Pitty there are so many small extra rules and variants squeezed on the cards. This way you have to read into each game seperately and can only really start playing fast after you played often and know most of the functions.

Great game that is hampered by its collectible nature and requirement to keep up with the relentless release schedule. Those factors made me give up on it.

PROS
- Great licensing here allowing you to play DC vs Marvel vs TMNT vs etc.
- overall the dice are very cool.
- quick playing with a small footprint.
- really good fan-made solo variant.
- "Dice building" mechanic twist on "deck building"
- There is some depth to the game if you get serious about it by collecting the "good" cards and/or looking for good combinations.
- Two good, serious players going head to head can be quite the cerebral battle as both attempt to setup combos and defensive counters.

CONS
- collectible nature of the game with tiered cards (Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc) means that it's not a level playing field like a LCG. Some people have cards others didn't get access too or weren't willing to buy in the secondary market.
- Wizkids quality control.
- Wizkids release schedule.
- The game doesn't promote characters as much as just random individual cards... so if you want to play Superman and Spiderman just for fun, their cards could potentially be terrible whereas Cheetah or Aunt May could be amazing cards.
- It's hard to play the game casually because then you miss the depth of the serious game. It can just become a random grind or very unbalanced because of the cards drafted or chosen for fun.
- Related to the above, there isn't any support for the casual player with for example recommended starting teams.
- Overall, not worth the price of keeping up with the game, hunting down cards, list building vs the overall gameplay experience.

This game is excellent.  I have not played the Marvel version of this, but the D&D game is great.  The mechanics are the same where you draw 4 dice from a  bag and try to deploy monsters and characters to attack your opponent and draw down their life.  

I cannot say enough good things about this game.  It was immense fun.  

At times, it can be a little fiddly and you can forget about abilities and other capabilities.  But with time and experience, I can see this going away.  I really like the game and recommend it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
More like Quarriors + Magic: the Gathering than D&D, but that doesn't detract from the fun of this at all. Inexpensive game, cheap boosters that give you a LOT of stuff for the money, plays well with other Dice Masters sets/expansions, and doesn't turn into a collect-a-thon like other CCGs (although you certainly CAN make it one).

ADDENDUM: A few months later, I'm still very much enjoying this. It lends itself well to many formats and house-rules, and the dissociation between cards/dice means you'll be able to trade/give away your extra cards to friends while keeping a full pool of dice to run whatever version of the monster you like.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. I'm not necessarily a fan of collectible games, and I don't care much for dice rolling in general. But...

Well, first, the collectible game aspect of Dice Masters is not much of an issue, since you can get more than enough cards and dice for very cheaply, and getting the rarer cards I don't think would change things too much. Second, this feels a lot like a deck-building game with dice, more than a dice game. Of course, I'm willing to overlook the whole dice rolling thing for a good game anyway, and this so far strikes me as a pretty good game. Of course, like any deck-building game, luck can get the better of you, but overall there are a lot of tactical  (e.g. when do I attack?) and strategic (e.g. cheap dice or expensive dice?) decisions to be made. The strategic decisions come both before the game in building a team and during the game when buying your dice.

For the Dungeons & Dragons set specifically, I really enjoyed that theme as applied to Dice Masters. Some things are not very thematic - why are good adventurers teaming up with evil monsters and adventurers, for example? But a lot of things are, and frankly, I don't care much because building a team of a bunch of monsters like beholders and minotaurs and setting them loose on one's hapless opponent is just too much fun. Also, the art work, borrowed from Dungeons & Dragons as it is, is good, colorful, and fun, and the dice are very attractive. Overall I think this theme really enhances the base game experience for me.

I like it!

RATING: 7.3
It definitly improves Quarriors! in several ways. Quarriors! was a very light game, where most decisions were obvious, and this is still a light game, but you each turns you are presented with several decisions where you can really choose.

The part I don't like that much is where you can choose your cards to bring to the game. This brings Dice Masters closer to Magic than to Quarriors! Yes, it's cool to be able to make custom "dice decks", but it comes at the cost of "forcing" you to collect cards and dice in numbers. It is a game that requires a great dedication in terms of money and time, and as much as I love Dice Masters, I'm not willing to commit to none of them.

And yes, I know I can play with the base set and nobody foces me to buy boosters. But we all know how this works.

Lastly, the dice quality also seems to be an improvement over Quarriors! But that was not difficult.

A fun dice building game that apes the tone of Magic: the Gathering but with less overhead. The artwork on the cards is very good and the dice are varied enough in color and markings to quickly glance over and decipher which ones are which. Obviously some good design work at play. 

Only big complaints are the lack of an included play mat which really helps to understand the flow of the game (find one online to print off and use if this is your first dice masters game), and the fact that matches are often over before you even get too many of your good character dice into play (we ended up playing to 30 or 40 health just to make it more of big brawl instead of quick duel).

Not sure what I was expecting, but it is just a re-theme of the Marvel Dicemasters game.  That said, it is a theme I enjoy, but Wizkid's decision to reuse art for the different levels of the cards is just cost-cutting BS.  
So, if you liked Marvel DM, and you like D&D, and you don't mind redundant art: this one's for you.

It isn't for me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An ok dice game, with some interesting decisions both before and during the actual game. I like the idea of the "deck building" and how it plays out with the dice.

Unfortunately, I don't like the way it's implemented in Dice Masters very well. Some of the mechanics are not at all intuitive (like when dice go to the KO pile), which makes it a bit hard to teach and remember the rules. Every new set also adds more keywords and rules, and the publisher Wizkids does a generally poor job of balancing the game. It can also take a very long time to build your "deck" if you're not very familiar with the options, so the setup can take much longer than the game itself.

I also really dislike the collectible model that Dice Masters uses, where you can only buy random cards and dice in booster packs. They also release some cards exclusively at tournaments, which is annoying if you have completionist tendencies. I much prefer the model that many other collectible games (like X-Wing) use, where you know exactly what is in each expansion and how much it will cost to buy it.

Ultimately, I can only see Dice Masters being really fun if you went all-in on it as a lifestyle game, or if you really get into the theme of games and care very little about balance or intuitive rules. Even then, there are so many better lifestyle two-player games (X-Wing, Netrunner, BattleCON, Mage Wars, Memoir 44, etc.) that I just don't think Dice Masters is worth it.

A near complete set of Dungeons & Dragons Dice Masters: Battle for Faerûn. The only cards I am missing are:

Rare:
Carrion Crawler
Owlbear
Magic Helmet
Prismatic Spray

Super Rare:
Red Dragon
Tarrasque

I have 8 of each die with the exception of the Minsc & Boo promo character which only has one die. I also have a set of the grey pearlized assistant & basic action dice. All of the dice are in wonderful bead storage containers (you can see how they look here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dcoyg4ktz0ssmj3/IMG_0341.jpg ) and you would be getting two of those as each case holds a complete set of dice (max of 4 which is the most you can have on a single card) 

Two UltraPro Pro-Dual Deck Boxes. One has a complete set of single cards (minus the six I am missing obviously), sleeved in Ultra-Pro sleeves and sorted by energy type and the other contains the duplicates (primarily Common & Uncommon but a few Rares left in the mix) and about 20 extra dice above and beyond the 8 of each type of die.

Approx Trade Value: $200 ($250 with the storage solutions, deck boxes and sleeves)

I gave a review of "Uncanny X-Men", my thoughts about the mechanics and collectability of the game would be covered there. This really just expands on that review with the cards and playstyle of this collection.

The D&D dice masters set introduces a lot of new mechanics. Adventurers being able to level up is a big one, as well as being able to attach equipment to characters.

Overall, I really enjoyed this set. The idea of monsters battling against adventurers with magic swords/helmets. The adventurers gained XP and being stronger next time. Abilities affecting good/evil characters. Swarms. Dragons.....

It is a little annoying that Monsters in YuGiOh are not equal to Monsters in D&D - which limits the interactivity of the sets (ie, a hero in X-Men does equal a hero in DC). That kind of sucks a bit.

I'd say this is my favorite of the sets I have played thus far. The others being Uncanny X-Men (very good set) and War of Light (horrible set to play).

10-05-2014. Busy collecting them all. I currently own 2 super-rares and almost complete common/uncommon sets. I still need a lot of rares though (14).

15-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. I have played the other dice master games. I do like this one more for thematic reasons, I like fantasy more than super heroes. 

The game is fun. Each turn, you take a 4 dice from a dice bag and roll them. You start rolling (and reroll) some starting dice you can use to make free 1/1 creatures or give you a resource (? = wild, or of certain other types). You can use those to buy new dice that are put into the USED pile. Dice from that pool you get back only when you have used all dice in your bag and need to draw more. If you get a creature, you can attack. If you do, you damage your opponent (who starts at 20 life) equal to the Attack value of the dice. The die is than put into the USED pile. If you block such an attacking dice, the defending dice could be defeated. If that happens, you may reroll it at the start of your turn as if you got an extra die.

D&D Dice Masters works exactly the same as the other dice master games, you bring a certain number of cards with dice.  Unfortunately these are collectible and with different rarity, so you don't know what you get. I think I would have liked the LCG model for these better. But it is what it is. The game is fun though. It's light, quick, fun.

Doesn't feel like the D&D RPG or Adventure System. More similar to a thinly-pasted generic fantasy-themed dice-based deckbuilder: you roll dice to gain energy to pay to buy dice (that you bring to the game) to add to your dice bag. Monsters attack and block like Magic. Dragon Dice did a better job of recreating hordes of armies battling each other.

Love the new mechanics/abilities.  I think this set plays the best out of all of them.  My only complaint is why does the dice quality have to be such garbage! I buy Chessex factory seconds that are in far better condition.

Wizards! Skeletons! Dragons! Is that die a creature or is it energy? Roll it to find out. Depth of strategy and interesting combinations keep this game fun.

Love it and so does my 10 year old - also like that the boosters are cheaper than stickers so he can buy them with pocket money (although could get expensive if you tried to play competitively) but as a friendly 2 player game its great.

This is a fun, relatively light, dice game. I like the D&D theme the most out of the currently available Dice Masters sets, and it's easy enough for my 5-year-old to play with me (with a little coaching) and really enjoy it.

Awesome game, it combines the aspects of Magic the Gathering with dice rolling. It's a great game. The dungeons and dragons one was the first I played, and I love pretty much all the sets made.

I love throwing dice! Only tried the intro game. Like the idea but would need to play again with own selected cards to decide if I rate this higher.

This completely replaced Quarriors for me. It feels, at last, like a finished, polished system.

Most well rounded Dice Masters set to date (I own and have played them all). Beautiful art, cards are thicker, dice look amazing. Great mechanics and more balanced gameplay than we've seen in this game so far. Excellent stand alone set, looking forward to more D&D Dice Masters.

I am sure I prefer card drafting to dice drafting but it is a neat idea and works well. I feel it would be better with more packs but I am reluctant to go down that route though, especially after my experience with the rules.
It is a MAJOR issue that I have with this game. It's the worst rule book I have ever encountered (out of about 60 or so different games I have played). While I have come across others that had erroneous rules, I have always been able to get definitive answers to my questions through online FAQ's. For such a small game (it's just a starter pack after all) there are still rules that I don't fully know if I am getting right and a couple that I pretty much have to house rule (something I usually refuse to do) because I find that certain official rules contradict each other.

I've never played magic or warhammer or anything like that, and I've always wanted something like that, a game where I build my own set of SOMETHING. Dice Masters is a perfect fit for me. 

I'm not the best at the game but I've found playing it with my wife, friends, and people at my FLGS very rewarding.

I have most of the starter and a lot more from a gravity feed. I'm looking to sell or trade away them all.

My first contact with deck building and I liked it a lot (should have said we because it was a hit in our house), it opened my eyes to the mechanism and I believe Flip City to be a great gateway to it. If you are into deck building I don't think it will impress (unless the theme is apealling to you). The whole buying and putting on the discard pile felt really odd to me, but when it clicked it was great.

Decent micro deckbuilder. I love building cities. I like the flipping mechanic, makes the game feel unique. It didn't feel exciting to play, but I always felt like I had a lot of options. Very low player interaction. Would like to get the expansion!

A neat little deckbuilding game with unique gameplay. The draw deck has to be held to avoid revealing the second card from the top. The game feels cumbersome as it plays out, a little too long for what it is.

More solitairish than I was hoping and it just bumps up against the edge of being slightly too long (but doesn't cross the line).

Not a bad game, but forgettable. The art and theme are bland. The main thing new it brings to the deck-building genre is the double-sided cards which, once the novelty wears off, is actually a bit irritating since it's too easy to inadvertently "cheat" by catching a glimpse of the cards underneath the top card. It also seemed to run longer than warranted for the amount of game play on offer.

I wanted to like this game. It's unfortunately complex compaired to many deck builder and overly long for what is included here. Turns become overly bogged down with calculations/flips etc and margin of error skyrockets to the point even accidental cheating can occur. 

Tried this with multiple play groups after playing it myself (4) all of which replied they wouldn't seek it out to play again and some were more negative.

Another nifty Asian city-builder game, thematically in the vein of Machi Koro but mechanically this is a deck builder with multiple use cards, which you can upgrade by flipping over, thus the title. Push your luck element as well as you turn over cards from your deck, before the Building Phase. Easy to pick up, intuitive even for new players, this is a charming game, what more to say?

Really interesting micro deck builder. All of your cards have another version on their back sides. You can pay to flip them or buy a new card. There is also a fun push your luck mechanic where you can only go up to 2 unhappy faces on your cards. If you get a 3rd, your turn ends. I also like how there are 2 completely different ways to win the game (get 8 Vp's shown on your played cards or play 18 cards in 1 turn). Just know that there is some screwage in the game as you can pay to give bad cards from your deck into your opponent's deck. Simple, quirky and fun.

This is a small deck building game where cards are double sided and flipping them to their better side is an option rather than purchasing new cards. There is also some push your luck, as the number of cards you play in a turn is only limited to not playing 3 bad symbols, some of which are on cards that you must play if they show up.

It is enjoyable but really needs more variety. Also the push your luck is fun when your deck is bigger but at the beginning it can cause you to lose multiple turns without too much of a choice and give someone an early lead that is very hard to overcome.

Could be better with expansions but still a decent little game as it is.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Interesting twist on deck building where you don't have a hand of cards, but instead play each card 1 by 1 off the top of your deck.  I know there are some promo cards, but not sure how much replayability this one has since there are only 4 decks of cards to buy from and the game runs a little long to be a filler (took us a little over an hour with rules explanation).  Probably a little more random than a standard deck builder, but there are still many engine building / optimization choices.  One I would like to play more of, but I don't think this will be replacing other deck builder type games that I enjoy (Dominion, Star Realms, etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A cute game, pretty easy to explain and quick to play. Also a game that often ends with me wanting to play again. Not much player interaction, though, except on the (usually) rare occasions where you can pass some of your less useful Apartment cards to your opponent. The double-sided cards make for a neat mechanic, even if it does complicate shuffling a bit: if you look at the deck while you shuffle, you see what cards are near the top, so you have to shuffle under the table (as recommended in the rulebook).

A clever design in that it creates a deck building game out of very few cards, and utilizes a card flipping mechanism that I don't think I've seen before.

However, despite the cleverness, I just didn't find myself super engaged by the game, or all that interested in what was going on. A game I'd play if someone else really was into it, but not a game I'd suggest playing.

RATING: 5
Nice artwork. Mechanics (and text on the cards) don't work for me as I feel I am re-reading cards and checking the other card side (too many card actions for what I feel should be a quicker and tighter game).  Potential for accidently flipping cards (e.g. when shuffling or check other side of cards).

RATING: 4
There's certainly some cleverness here and it's a thoughtful design, but it's also frustrating and overshadowed by its gimmick.

One practical issue is that I would periodically bump my draw deck, shifting cards slightly so that I could see what was coming up.  This directly counters the main mechanisms in the game.

I also found it went a little long and was pretty slow, even as a two player game.  I can't imagine how much downtime near game end in a 4 player.

I think some people will absolutely dig the core mechanics, but it's not for me.

Fun micro deckbuilder.

The "flip over a card to upgrade it" game mechanism is interesting. Instead of buying new cards, you can upgrade a card in your discard pile by flipping it over. You can also "recycle" a card in your discard pile, basically un-upgrading it (flipping it back) for a temporary benefit.

You have to be careful when you shuffle, and not accidentally flip cards over to their alternate side. We had to stop a game because my daughter accidentally shuffled one half of her deck upside down. (It's an easy mistake to make since the cards are dual-sided and don't have easily identifiable backs. She handed them to me to shuffle them, but then I handed them back to her and told her to shuffle them herself. She flipped over half the deck during the exchange.) One player accidentally flipped his deck when putting it down to get something to drink. This was easier to fix out - the cards looked wrong when he played his next turn, and he realized his mistake.

The game has a push-your-luck element. If you play cards that have too many unhappy faces, you lose your turn. Some cards force you to play more cards, possibly with busting because of more unhappy faces. You can upgrade cards to avoid this.

This game can be a little mean. We played mostly with four players. One player ended up being the target of all the bad cards. This might be specific to our play group: my girlfriend was targeted by her brother and daughter. Regardless, being singled out didn't make the game fun. This game might work better with two players.

There aren't enough cards to keep the game interesting. There are five types of cards you can buy (with the included Office expansion), but after a few plays, it felt like we saw all the game had to offer. I haven't played with the Flip City: Reuse expansion, but I don't think that the additional two card types would be worth it.

I tried the solo play rules, but they weren't very difficult. I lost my first game, but won the next two. It feels like I've "figured out" the solo game already. You might be able to make up rules to make the solo game harder, but I don't think that would add anything meaningful to the solo play experience.

This small small box holds a pretty big game. I thought it would be a 20-30 minute play, but it’s run over an hour in the two times I’ve taught it to 3 people. 

I bought it for the plane ride back from Gen Von, and I’m glad I did.  It was a fun single player experience. 

Iconography and rules can be a bit tricky, despite (or because of?) simplicity and brevity.

Based on 1 play with 2 players:

Really cute and creative little deckbuilder. Despite its tiny size and low rules overhead, it took me much longer to wrap my head around the strategies here - things didn't really "click" for me until around the 2/3rds through the first game mark.

There's a strong push-your-luck element at work here that really makes this game feel different from other deckbuilders.

The lack of a random setup may hurt replayability here, though. But since there's lots of clever little ways to build your deck I think it will outlast other games without random setups. Still, I look forward to the expansion which hopefully addresses this.

The game is listed as 1-4 players, so it does have a 1-player variant, which is actually really fun.  It keeps the essence of the game and still balances the gameplay to make it a challenge.  

Overall, I'd recommend this game for a small, cheap game to add to a collection.  But it's not necessarily a filler.  With 4 people, it can easily take an hour.

An interesting card drafter.  Like Dominion you are buying from a common pool of cards.  Unlike Dominion this is set up the same for each game.  I suspect with repeated play you will find a few routes to take which work particularly well, but the game is enjoyable enough to make that process one worth following.  A push-your-luck element does add to the excitement, and the ways of mitigating that danger are interesting, especially burdening your opponents with more of these bad cards.  And the artwork is lovely.

RATING: 4
Obviously designed with efficiency in mind, but the double-sided cards prove to be more frustrating than not.  There's no kind of helper text to tell you what's on the other side, so you have to constantly flip the cards over to remind yourself and risk messing up your deck.  Beyond that, it's another non-confrontational deckbuilder with exactly the same card market every time.

Gimicky deck builder with double-sided cards.  The lack of strategy and decision choices just made every game seem the same and it difficult to explain the rules.  I think without the expansion, there are only 5 building choices you can buy,  There's some push your luck to get more money, but this is just drawing more cards and hoping to avoid too many sad faces, else your turn will end!  Seems to need a bit more development or more card choices as all 3 or 4 games quickly became very samey.  It's a race to get production, destroy/flip-back your opponent's buildings (is this thematic?) to achieve the required level of citizen happiness, thereby ending the game.

Played at Geekway to the West and bought it right there.  Straightforward deckbuilder and extremely fun.  Easy to teach as well.  Hardest thing is trying to shuffle your deck properly without accidentally flipping/seeing cards!

The Reuse cards definitely add some nice benefits into the game. I already enjoyed the base, but I think I'll keep these extra cards into my games going forward.

Really interesting little deckbuilder with a push-your-luck aspect that makes it different and interesting.

The flip mechanic is good and I think this will shine as a two player game as the amount of interaction is limited and it is difficult to directly affect another players deck without specifically building your deck to do that. 

There is a limited number of actual cards in the game however this is not at limiting as I anticipated and there are still plenty of options, and I haven't added the included office expansion yet  :)

Looking forward to many more games of this.

Played 3 times today, last with the Office expansion and I lost that game. My friend finally dumped lots of Residential onto me, and finally set about buying Parks. But oh those unhappy faces put the kibosh on him when he could have won!

I'm really enjoying Design Town. It is a deck-building, it has no inter-action beyond dropping cards onto opponents, but it is still a fascinating little game. To get so much game out of so few cards is incredible. To have so many different ways to tackle the same objective too, it's a remarkable game.

The double sided cards seem new to me, I don't think I've encountered that anywhere before. I must have, but it seems so innovative, you'll be seeing it in lots of games.

I've sleeved my cards now, in anticipation of a lot more action. Cracking little game!

Design Town is a pretty standard deck-building game with the twist that the cards are double-sided and can be upgraded. I'm not sure these two-sided cards are actually an asset, though, since they make learning the cards a chore and handling more difficult.

Other than that the game is a solitary struggle to optimize your deck and maybe get a lucky draw earlier than the competition. Even if you do like that kind of game, with only a handful of different cards its replay value is quite limited. It rather obviously cries for expansions but those would make the issues with the two card faces even more pronounced.

The more I play this, the more I enjoy it. Like any deck-builder, becoming familiar with the cards is essential to winning, so it can take a few plays to get good at it. IMO there aren't any useless cards in the game; they all serve a good function, are all helpful, and actually make sense thematically. Only played with 2 players, and I've heard that's the best anyway. If you enjoy deck-builders I definitely recommend it!

Straightforward little soloable deck builder with a unique mechanism where you can spend to flip a card over if you wish instead of spending to buy a new card. (Maybe try fewer office cards for solo play or remove entirely?  I like it but it seems overpowered for solo.)

A light deck builder but there are too little build options in this game and the press your luck is punishing. It makes it hard to build up to some cooler buildings and experiment with stuff. There is also some take that which is neutral for me but others might not like it

At least the game isn't too long for 2p. Maybe longer with 3 and I wouldn't play with 4. Overall just a bit boring

Some nice ideas and interesting decisions to make, but you have little interest in what the other players are doing, so a bit solitaire-like.  Likely to get a bit samey after a few plays.

It's a very unique game that somehow really works. I like the push-your-luck aspect combined with a deck builder. The 2-sided cards were a bit confusing at first but it really works. The 2 victory conditions seem balanced and are a fun mix. I have played Mystic Vale which has borrowed from this game's unhappiness mechanic, but this game does it much better and is also a better game beyond this mechanic.

A very simple push your luck deck builder.  Different because you don't get a hand of cards; you play a card from the top of your deck and can see the next one to decide if you wish to play that one as well (some cards you are forced to play and can bust out, losing the benefits of that turn.  Buy cards to add to your deck, send junk cards to your neighbours.  Win if you get 8 victory points or can play 18 consecutive cards in a single turn.  Seems fine, need to play it.

Really quick little card game. Has the same push your luck deckbuilder with a twist feel as Mystic Vale, although the twist there is a lot different than here. In this game not only are you buying new cards, but you can pay to flip them to become generally better cards as well. Ultimately there's not much to this game but because it plays so quickly and is a fun enough ride, it's hard to fault it too much for being perhaps a bit high on luck and low on tough decisions.

Flip City sits in an awkward place. It adds some unique twists to the deckbuilding genre that move the game from the more strategic realm into the realm of pushing ones luck. That would make it an ideal evolution, except the loss of strategic gameplay makes it less interesting for seasoned gamers. At the same time, the game doesn't do a great job of making deckbuilding more approachable. That is where this game's target audience is: players who "get" deckbuilding, but don't enjoy strategic games. It's a small demographic, but for those gamers, it fits the bill.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (September 2015)

I haven’t heard of Flip City until a friend asked me to play it. After the game explanation, it seemed like a very novel idea in the deckbuilding genre, however my only play was very rushed and no one was really paying attention to the game. Due to this I feel I need to play it again soon to re asses my opinion of the game.

For now I can say the art is ok and the rules are very easy. I think it is best as a two player game, our game was with 4 players and the downtime was excessive for such a simple game, besides that was one of the reasons for the general distraction we had. On a related note, I fell the game duration is way too long, I was under the impression it should take around 20 minutes to finish it, but that wasn’t the case.

It is somewhat hard to not flip the cards when you draw them, that’s a very ingrained habit we have :D, however I’m not saying this is a negative for the game, in fact, I really liked this mechanism, but cheating (unintentional or intentionally) is very easy in this game. It is also very hard not to accidently peek to the next card in your deck when you play it, to avoid this, all of us had the drawing deck in our hands and not on the table.

The “push your luck” mechanism isn’t welcome here, it can easily decide who wins. I know you can mitigate it a bit upgrading the cards or buying other cards, but it is always present so I don’t really like the core idea of the game.

Bottom line, it is true I need to play it again to give a better opinion, but for now I feel Flip City is nothing special, at most it can accomplish “ok game” status from me, but I feel that with more plays its rating will get lower.

The game is bogged down by the rules and the 'rules exceptions' on the cards.  As a deck building game it is OK, but there are too many ambiguities that we found.

A deck builder who's six cards are doubled by the fact that you can turn them to other side for more. Unfortunately, that makes shuffling and not knowing what's coming hard -- and the game play strategy is really to get the best you can pressing your luck to reach a victory condition. Honestly, it was nothing to do flips over despite being an okay game.

PLUS: easy to learn
MINUS: double-sided makes shuffling and not cheating hard, some rules need better explanation, doesn't really grab and demand more plays
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Design Town is incredibly clever for a game which uses only 5 types of cards.  It's in how these cards work though, that's really amazing.  Building your engine takes a good amount of time though and may slog the game down slightly.  However, once you've got some good cards in hand (and flipped over those damn Residentials) you'll be in the swing of things.  This one is a great little deck builder.

Tried it twice with my wife. Turns take awhile. It also feels like after several more plays the speed would pick up, but the optimal strategy would become apparent. I don't think there's enough depth or variety for this game to be worth it. It is an interesting mechanic though, perhaps if it was implemented as a part of another game...

I'd recommend trying Star Realms to scratch the deck builder micro-game itch.

I received this game as a free gift from the publisher, Tasty Minstrel Games (Awesome company). We played it for the first time tonight at a local brewery meetup. Pros: Small footprint. Game box is tiny and the components don't take up much space on the table. This is a perfect game to take to a restaurant, a road trip or even on an airplane. It can be played on small playing surfaces and still provides the feel of a deck builder without countless piles of cards everywhere. If you've played deck builders before, you will pick up on this quickly. Cons: This game felt a bit long at 4 players. The box says 30-50 minutes and it lived up to its billing. My problem with this is that I can probably play 2 games of Dominion in the time it takes to play this once. That may change with different player counts and multiple plays, but after my first play, these are my thoughts.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There is a certain person I should never play games with - he always makes me less than excited about the games we play with his tendencies (I know he's only a kid but still...). Game wise, I didn't find it all that interesting although the flip aspect was novel. Seems like pretty limited decisions and once you learn the different routes to victory, it is pretty much a streamlined race that doesn't bode well for replayability.

Not at all what I was thinking this game would be. There's a voice inside me that makes me think I'd enjoy a city building game. I've tried a number of them and none of them ever quell it, and I don't know if that's because I just haven't found the right one yet or because that voice is stupid and I shouldn't be listening to it. Anyhow, I thought this would be a thing of laying out cards in a grid, upgrading them, etc. Instead it's a small deckbuilder with a push your luck thing that I've now seen twice in a few days going on and a not so great rulebook and iconography. Once you've sussed out how it plays, it's actually not a bad little game. I'm not sure I'd play with more than two.

It's really frustrating when you want to flip a card in your discard pile, but don't have enough money to do so and so have to reshuffle your deck, preventing you from flipping it (or you do have enough money but the card isn't there). Therefore, even this game's unique mechanic isn't particularly exciting. Outside of that this is a pretty bare bones deckbuilder, and the lack of variability really hurts it. That might be fine if this game lasted about 20 minutes to act as a filler, but the 40ish minute length is too long for what it is. Finally, about the win conditions: while you do build your deck to mitigate luck being against you you can still have things go not according to plan for quite a few turns.

Weird deck-builder that uses two-sided cards.  Minimal card choices and strange push-your-luck aspects, yet overall it worked.  I doubt it has legs for more than a few plays, but it's interesting to see where the genre can go even for short excursions.

Don't like the two-sided cards -- too difficult to shuffle and too easy to accidental see what upcoming deck cards are if the deck slides a bit.  Not really that impressed with the game.  It seemed too long for what it is, which is a deck builder with only 5 card types.

Flip City by @tastyminstrel is getting a lot of love on IG lately. When I received a review copy, I decided to play it through thoroughly and share my thoughts. This Tiny Treasure hits my weak spot immediately as the high quality game box can easily be tossed into any bag for gaming on the go. You could even use a standard deck box and combine it with another Tiny Treasure of your choice. For solo play you even need less cards; 25 from the top of my head. Now for the rule book. It is short and fresh, yet I really needed to check out @watchitplayed on YouTube and BGG for rule clarifications. For future print runs including an example turn or two could help. With regard to solo game play: I love Flip City! Once you get the hang of it you can increase your game pace giving me the feel of playing non-stop Patience on a rainy day when I was a child. This micro deck builder provides choices for adding cards to your deck, changing (flipping) them whilst in your deck or removing them from your deck. Another like from my side! Just like playing Patience you'll win some and lose some more depending on your shuffle. I played 5 solo games and won games 3 and 5 using different tactics. This picture is my game 5 win tableau. Looking forward to playing 2, 3, or 4 player games and curious what the other two Flip City boxes could add. For now, two thumbs up for Flip City! I advise to improve the rule book and agree with the love it has been getting on IG #boardgames #bgg #movetherobber #reviewcopy #flipcity #tastyminstrelgames #playtmg #soloplay #tinytreasures

Played one time in solitaire mode. Good deck building/jigsaw experience, maybe too easy with the suggested setup. I like the minimalist effort to simplify the deck building core mechanic in an only 86 cards deck with simple rules. It's something like a "Machi Koro Express" without dice throwing.

...but only when I suggest it to myself.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/I4NSfrjU_gg

Flip city is a deck building game with double sided cards. And while this makes it harder to shuffle the game is pretty cool. Instead of drawing a limited number of cards as your hand you push your luck in a system that was used more recently in Mystic Vale. You can choose to buy new cards or 'flip' the ones you own to more powerful versions. 

An interesting and enjoyable deck builder that may not quite have the legs of its comparatives.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice fast deck-builder with push-your-luck at it's heart. The only downside is the blind shuffling and reminding players to hold their deck correctly.

Since players are constantly holding onto their decks, I should probably sleeve this, but it's so cheap I may not bother.

A really clever little filler game. There are different avenues to victory, and no strategy feels too dominant. The only problem I have with the game is that the length can vary quite a bit. If you don't play to be too confrontational, this game will be over with very quickly, but if you're throwing stuff at your opponents, it can take longer. Definitely best with two, as it can run a little long with more.

My first play through was decent. I can see the deck building aspect as you push you deck closer to scoring a winning turn. I enjoyed the push your luck aspect, though early in the game you can't help but bust several times each, which felt a pit passe.

Flip City is a push-your-luck deckbuilding game. You can draw as many cards as you want, trying to get more money to buy or flip cards, or victory points to try to reach the game-winning threshold. However, if you draw too many cards with unhappy-face icons, then your turn immediately ends and you don't get to buy anything (or win, obviously). It also has a gimmick where you can flip the cards to use the other side, but I'm not sure that the actual gameplay value of this mechanic outweighs the possibility of dropping some cards or accidentally flipping over the entire deck and ruining the whole game. The game is pretty much completely multiplayer solitaire. It's a decent filler.

Being able to affect your opponent is interesting. You don't need to, but if you do, it helps you and hinders them. In my plays so far, my girlfriend loves just buying lots of stuff but rarely pays to flip cards in the discard, or even use recycle effects. Meanwhile I try to play very deliberately and strategically. She ends up winning 85 percent of the time.

The dual sided/flip mechanic is what drew me to this, and I still think it's very clever. The game takes longer than I think it should, but that is okay. It is enjoyable, but I have to be in a certain mood to play it. 
Also, the cards are great quality. The box is huge for the amount of cards you have.

This game is somewhat clunky in that you basically need to keep your decks in your hands at all times.  I also don't know why the game takes so long for what it is.

This game was pretty weak. It's a cute idea in terms of being innovative with the whole deckbuilder idea, but the options are too few and the way your turn can suddenly end due to card flips is more frustrating than fun. The thing about a city builder is also that I want to see the city unfold in front of me, and in this game you wipe it away and start again on your next turn.

Deck-building and city building. The core of the game is you take cards that give you money "play phase" and use them to upgrading cards you have or acquire new cards "building phase". 

The first trick to this is that the cards are double-sided, so upgrading them is flipping them over, kind of like Le Havre chips. The second trick is you have a deck but not a hand; on your turn you play cards directly from the top of the deck to your play area, and you always know what the next card will be. The third trick is that some cards have a "sad face" on them, and if three if them are in your play area your turn immediately ends, meaning you miss out on the building phase. 

One card in particular with the sad face must be played if on top of your deck, so this is push-your-luck, where you want more cards for either the money in the early game or VP in the late game, but you can "bust" if you go too far.

Cons:
* Deck builders are kind of dull
* Low interaction except through spite moves

After a half dozen plays, I have to admit this game fills a really fun niche. It's a quick playing deck builder that my wife no only likes, but can win at consistently. While we rarely interact by pushing Apartment and Residential Areas to our opponents, the _threat_ of that happening is always on your mind and does raise the tension levels a bit. Every time someone gets 8+ coins and _doesn't_ use it to send a Residential Area your way, you're grateful.

I like it. I'm ready to rate it, starting at a 7. We haven't added the Office yet, but if the game doesn't get a few more unique cards, I expect to burn out in about 20 plays; which is still a great $/play ratio.

= 2015-08-31

I just don't think I like deck building as a game mechanic, whether it's in its pure form (Dominion, Puzzle Strike, Star Realms, Flip City) or as a smaller part of a more involved game (Rococo). Fatastiqa, co-op Star Realms and solo Flip City have been enjoyable so I'm holding out hope there's a Deck Builder I'll really like.

I've got Eminent Domain, Merchants of the Dale, Orleans, King's Forge, Baseball Highlights 2045, and Valley of the Kings to still try.

Okay. I just want to say this was the worst game experience I had ever had. This game went on for an hour and no one could win it, 4 player game. I don't want to be too hard on this game though. I think I just had a bad experience. So I'm going to leave my rating at a 6 which is still admitting that this game is not a "bad" game. I cannot at this moment objectively assess what went wrong. I stopped caring after about 15 minutes. I don't think I need to ever play this one again. Even if it was a bit better after a second play, it would still be one I could live without. I'll have to pass on this one. Had high hopes for this one because of the cheap price and cool concept, didn't produce for me.

Have only played 2 player and there does seem a good amount of replayability, despite the limited selection of cards. Can be a bit of a luck element with it, but this can be balanced by knowing you'll have a good next turn if you have bad luck pulling all your unhappiness cards following a shuffle. 

The downtime between turns is completely fine for a 2 player game, but I'm not sure it would work so well for 4 players. 

For me, Flip City is a very fun little filler game. Definite thumbs up!

RATING: 5
Once the game gets going, there are interesting choices.  Early, your have few choices about what to buy, and about a 20% of busting before making a decision and losing a turn.

There is almost no interaction, except for rare directed spite.  However, the solo variant is too easy.

Also, the game lends itself to a mix of epic turns and very short turns, which can lead to boring stretches of waiting to get to actually make a choice.  It's not always like that, but it's almost guaranteed to happen a few times each game.

This mechanic and means of making a press-your-luck game deeper is interesting, but the starting deck plus lack of interaction leaves it as unrealized potential.

RATING: 6
Cleverly boils Dominion down to its essentials, with a Chapel-Garden (Church) versus a Province (Station) strategy to boot. Flipping and recycling cards is novel. Concerned about replayability and solitaire syndrome, though Dominion's million-and-one combinations never actually increased replayability in a fun way anyway. The Blackjack-like push-your-luck component is a nice additional touch of risk management, and is likely the driver of replayability.

RATING: 4
Played twice with 4P. Design Town adds a twist to the deckbuilding genre by utilising double-sided cards which can be flipped over for a cost. The game also ditches the conventional fixed hand size to draw each round in favour of a push-your-luck mechanism. Players may draw as many cards as they like, but they will go bust if they breach the limit of unhappiness symbols.

Unfortunately, practical issues arise as the game progresses. Even with only 10 distinct card faces, tracking the various effects becomes increasingly cumbersome as longer chains are created. The game also requires frequent shuffling – more than any other deckbuilder – and it needs to be done carefully so as not to reveal the card order by accident. The lack of variety further compounds the problems, and the result is a solitaire-like game which drags especially with 4 players.

RATING: 6
Offers some deckbuilding-lite (it -does- dub itself a 'microdeckbuilder') choices and is not bad at two players for a quick 'appetizer' game, but it's not really deep and starts to feel wholly samey after just a small number of plays.

This takes deckbuilding and adds a couple of interesting elements: a press-your-luck mechanic, as you lose you entire turn if you "bust", as well as being able to flip your cards, which changes their abilities. I also enjoy the mechanic of being able to pass cards into your opponents' decks, which generates some interaction as well. Even though the theme is pasted-on, I still like constructing buildings. Overall, this is fun twist on a deckbuilder, and something I do enjoy playing.

This is a neat little game, but it needs to be played a lot faster than our game was -- 74 minutes is WAY too long, even for a first play! It's an interesting deck-building sort of game with a nice push-your-luck element that is, fortunately, somewhat manageable. In the long run I think more card variety would help, but I certainly wouldn't mind playing this one again.

Everyone starts with the same cards, shuffled randomly. On your turn, you reveal cards one at a time (like in Mystic Vale) and add them to your display. If the card has a Upon Play action, you do what it says (e.g., Factory makes you discard bottom card from your deck). You can stop any time, unless the top card of your deck is the Residence (which MUST be played). You must stop -- you bust, ending your turn -- if your display shows more Sad Faces than your sad face limit (2 by default; each Church adds 1 to the limit). When you stop:
- if you have 8 VP showing, you win!
- if you have at least one Convenience Store, and a total of 18+ cards showing, you win!
- if not, tally the coins on all your cards in display. Use coins to do ONE of the following:
... Buy a card from the tableau
... Flip a card in your discard pile
... Develop a card from tableau = buy it and flip it
In addition, you can activate powers of cards in your display, and/or Recycle abilities of cards in your discard pile (flip the card and gain whatever benefit it says, e.g., an extra coin to spend this turn or a temporary bump to your Sad Face limit).

Whenever your draw deck is empty, immediately shuffle your discards (some cards also have a Shuffle ability that triggers here). At the end of your turn, discard all cards in your display. The game continues until someone manages to win.

RATING: 6
This is a small card game that combines "push your luck" and deck building mechanics.  Each player starts with a deck of 9 cards with 5 piles of cards in the center of the table.  On a player's turn they play cards form the top of their deck to accumulate coins, points, unhappiness, and other abilities.  You can only accumulate 2 unhappiness before you bust and lose your turn.  You can always see what the next card you will get is but some require you to draw them if they are the top card of your deck so if you're not careful you could be forced to draw into a bust.

The name of the game comes from the fact that all the cards are double sided.  With the coins you accumulate on a turn you can do one of 3 actions.  Buy a card from the center, flip a card in your discard pile, or buy and flip a card from the center.  The goal is to accumulate 8 points in a round without busting or playing a certain card with 18 other cards in a single round.

The mechanics of this game combine pretty well and it is a neat idea.  There is a little wonkiness when actually playing this in practice.  Since when you shuffle your deck you can't see what your top card is going to be people have to shuffle under the table or force themselves to look around the room or at the ceiling.  And while it hasn't happened yet, once person dropping their deck of cards could mean they can't finish the game since orientation is so important.

I had two issues with the game.  The first is that for a super simple filler game it took a bit longer than I would have wanted.  30-50 minutes is what BGG lists and that's probably close to accurate.  A game like this shouldn't take over 30 minutes.  The other is that the 5 stacks of cards that you can buy are all that you have in this game.  There are no other options.  For a deck builder that can make for a game that gets stale very fast, imagine if Dominion only had 5 different Kingdom cards to play with.

The art is also not anything to write home about.  I like the ideas but the game is in a weird place where it takes too long for a quick filler and doesn't have enough content to make me want to play it in any other capacity.

Flip City from Tasty Minstrel Games.
I need to give this one more play.
Comments:
* Too much downtime in a four player game for the game that it is.
* Very little player interaction. What little there is to cripple the other player.
* Very luck dependent in the early game can leave players out of the running.
* Setup is hard: Getting players the right cards, making sure they do not flip them, dropping cards on the floor and don't know what they are, setting up the piles.
 
Notes and FAQ:
Apartment: You give away the card only if you pay the $8. (Or use the Power Plant).
Hospital: Order matters. You only count extra coin from previously played cards.
Central Park: The "additional buy" means in addition to the one buy/flip/develop you normally get, either order.
Station: The "additional flip" means in addition to the one buy/flip/develop you normally get, either order.
Station: It actually reduces the printed flip cost on the card, so it affects both Flip actions and Develop actions.
Central Park & Station: You could buy, and then flip for -1.
Church: If you are at 2 unhappy and have Residential Area on top with a Church in the discard, you can choose to flip the Church before drawing the Residential Area.
Winning: Only after the build phase (for future expansion abilities.)
Winning: You cannot Develop, then flip for a VP to win since the flip ability is in Action phase.

Variant: Everyone starts the game with one Residential Area in the discard pile.

RATING: 3
I give the game a 4 based on its solo variant that is included in the rule book.  Very much feels just thrown in there at the last minute.  
After the first play and learning the cards I have found it way too easy to beat.  Simple strategy of collecting 1 or 2 Factories converting them to Power Plants to rid your deck of Apartments and then stocking the rest of your hand with Convenience stores and Central Parks and upgrading them for Victory pts and the win.
I have not had a chance to play the multi-player game yet, but hoping to get it to the table this weekend and then I can give it a fare rating based on the overall game.  After playing the multiplayer game I dropped my rating from a 4 to a 3.
I tried playing this with multiple players and all of us felt that the game was missing something.  It just didn't work out with anyone I played it with.  One of the biggest disappointments of 2015.

My solo house rules are at https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1554763/flip-city-solo-house-rules-scoring

UPDATED RATING: Bumped my rating from 8 to 10 after seeing how many 2 and 3 player games I've played. Also the solo game now holds up to repeated plays using house rules: Shuffle the supply cards into a deck and deal out three into the supply. You can only buy from the row of supply cards. As soon as one is taken, replace it from the supply deck. Any time you have to shuffle your discard pile, you must discard a card from the supply row. As soon as the supply deck is out and the last supply card is taken from the supply row, the game is immediately over (so the last card taken is worthless). The victory points you have showing at that moment are your score. The goal is to try to get your best score out of a theoretical (and probably impossible) maximum of 30 points. Mix in the Office and Reuse cards for a longer (and different) game.

ORIGINAL RATING: Solo is fun for 4 or 5 hands, you can add a few more by removing the Office cards, but once you figure it out it's stopping calling you to play it. Plays great with 2 or 3 players. Very accessible and easy to simply teach it as  you having a new player try their first game.

The instructions are very unclear, but watching "Watch It Played" made it much clearer. The game takes a VERY long time to become fun, because the game usually starts with 1 or 2 coin turns (Or 3 strikes because the residential areas are all in a row). Great 2 player game, but 4 player tends to drag on.

Definitely best with fewer players. I've played with 3 and with 2. I suspect 1 player might be the best number as there's just too much time spent watching the other player(s) take their turn(s).

Ultimately though, another mediocre TMG product. Though by far not their worst.

It's definitely possible to win by accident trying to earn VPs and playing 18 cards instead.

Really engaging for such a short card game. I'm not grading on a curve, but I also don't want to pretend like there is as much depth here as other deck-builders. What it does have, however, is a charming theme, innovative upgrade mechanic, and just plain fun experience. It's a bit multi-player solitaire. The ability to offload apartments onto other players helps with this, but I suspect that I will -- like most deck-builders -- enjoy this most at the two-player count.

When I first got introduced to deck builders, I thought this game was pretty fascinating, but after more play throughs I started to find a problem with the two player game and that one BIG problem is that the other person does not need to be there at all. This should be a solo game only in my opinion because the choices you make in the game don't make your opponent choose another strategy. If you are thinking about buying this game, save your money and choose something different.

Neat idea. A deckbuilder with double-sided cards and a push-your luck mechanic.

It was fun to play overall, but it feels like it goes a little long. This has the feel of a "small" game, because it's just a few cards and you just hold your deck in your hand instead of actually drawing cards from it. But for such a "small" game, it really seemed to outstay its welcome. I also don't think that push-your-luck games should last very long because the excitement diminishes pretty quickly and these games can become frustrating if you regularly push your luck too far.

RATING: 6
Flip City is a very light deckbuilding filler game. There are 5 (maybe 6?) types of cards. Each side of those cards is a different thing and which side is up makes a difference (hence the flip in the title).

On your turn, you play at least one card. You can keep playing cards until you hit 3 "frowny faces" on cards at which time you bust. But some cards force you to play another card, so knowing when to push and when to stop is important. After you stop (assuming you didn't bust) you can either buy one of the available cards or flip a card in your discard pile.

You keep doing this until one of two things ends the game. Either someone plays cards which show a total of eight stars, or someone plays 18 cards without busting.

I was a little lost in the beginning of the game, but there's not really much to pick up and after a while I think I figured it out. The advantage of this game is that it gives a lot of game for how few cards there are and it plays super quick. The disadvantage is that I have to imagine you'll hit a wall pretty quickly. You're going to play it a bunch since it's so quick and I just don't think there's enough game to support a lot of play. I suspect that they'll release an expansion or two for this, which would probably make it something I'd be more interested in.

About [thing=168679][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=168679][/thing] is a deck building game about building a city with lots of Stations and maybe some Power Plants, and, preferably with no one living on the said city, but, if some must, that they all live in Apartments, as Residential Areas are a curse and a plague to winning cities. I worry that, in a future expansion, they include the Arsonist and the Mortgage Executioner.

Anyway, [thing=168679][/thing] has two main twists regarding its deck building:

1) All the cards are double-sided: one face has the basic building and, in the verse, the upgrade version, and is possible to pay to flip a card to its upgrade side;

2) Players don't have a hand of cards, instead, at the start of the player's turn, she draw cards from the top of her deck until: a) she wants to stop; b) three sad faces (some cards have this icon) are put in the table and end immediately the turn of the player - yes, normally a player won't do this willingly, but there are cards that force the use of itself (Residential Area) or the next in the deck (Shopping Mall), which can make players lose turns.

[thing=168679][/thing] allows for some nifty card combos, even with its small number of cards, due to the double-sided nature of all of them. Turns are usually quick, still losing turns is a bummer and not a mechanic I particularly enjoy in games, but works here to create tension in the choice to continue or stop drawing cards.

Even though it offers more than one could imagine from its tiny box, and even some interaction in the use (like an "attack") of Residential Areas/Apartments, [thing=168679][/thing] still isn't a great game. Turns are mostly similar, losing a turn is a drag, and the game lasts for more than it should (around one hour), specially with four players, which also increases the downtime and the bad feeling when losing a turn. Unsurprisingly, [thing=168679][/thing] is, by votes, best with 2.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
You shuffle cards without seeing the deck (as you can see what they are). Then, on your turn, you can draw cards from the top of the deck, one by one. If a Residential Area is on the top of the deck, it must be played. With all the other cards, the player chooses to play or not the card at the top. Three sad face icons on the table ends the turn immediately.

In her turn, a player can:
a) Buy one card;
b) Flip a card (upgrade) that are in the discard pile, paying the cost to flip;
c) Buy one card and flip (upgrade) it - if the player has enough money to do this, she can.

Some cards allow for different actions.

The goal of the game is to put, in the table, 8 victory points (some cards have victory points on them) in a single card playing phase or to put 18 or more cards in the table, if at least one of them is a Convenience Store. The player that accomplishes either of these conditions, wins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The main is: when stop drawing cards. These takes into consideration not only what you already have put in the table (actions and total money), but also the card at the top of deck and the chance that a Residential Area is next, just bellow, and that it can make you lose the turn.

Next is: what to buy or flip? Though the amount of different cards isn't big, the decision is very important. However, paying to flip only works for cards in the discard pile, so, some times, you won't have the card you want to flip there, so the decision of what to do is made easier. The flip decision also is valid to the other way around: when to un-flip a card, as this is also possible in the game, and "unflipping" cards can give some important one-off bonus in a turn.

Connected to this last type of decision is another: who to attack/hinder/delay? [thing=168679][/thing] has two cards that allow this: Apartments (upgrade from Residential Areas) and Power Plant. The Power Plant simply allows for an Apartment (which is a weak card), that is in your discard pile, to be sent to discard pile of someone else. The Apartment is more cruel and costly: pay 8 money, then "unflip" the Apartment (making it again a Residential Area) and put it in someone else's discard pile.

These are basically the main decisions of [thing=168679][/thing].

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Small footprint - the box is tiny and can be taken anywhere without difficulty;
- Clever gameplay, with the flip and "unflip" type of actions;
- Neat twist to the genre of deck building.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Plays for too long with 4 players;
- Many turns are too similar to the others (a feel that is enhanced with the long duration);
- Losing turns isn't fun and this can happen due to luck of the draw, not only as consequence of a bad decision;
- Have little direct interaction between players (but, at least, isn't devoid of it).

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Very close to a movie villain with a goal of flipping a city block,  breaking down houses, in order to build a metro station and a shopping mall. There could be a lot of "cry faces" (as the game names the sad faces). You can even send the people to another district, making them the problem of someone else, and cleaning more space for your proper buildings. It is like SimCity, but with less people and more evil.

[thing=168679][/thing] works well as a deck building and offers a good deal of options to the players, not only what to buy, but what to use, when and to what end. This is a lot, considering the small number of cards (86, which include the start cards) for a deck building. Not an easy design to be done. I really thought the whole double-side nature of it would bring some problems, specially while putting cards in the discard and, less, in the shuffling. But no, it was OK - it sure is hard to know what other players have in their decks (if flipped or not), which could lead to some foul play, however, if you are worried about this, you are playing with the wrong people.

But, as a multiplayer game (over than 2), [thing=168679][/thing] mostly fails. It runs for too long (around one hour, and this can even be more), there isn't enough interaction that actually make use of having more persons playing, and losing turns hurt more when you have to wait longer for your next go. It is almost like this is properly a 2 player game, one that  allows for more, but shouldn't.

So this is [thing=168679][/thing], on one side, good things, on the other, bad, and they come together. Proper, I guess.

well, i think i am done.  i love deck-builders, so was inclined to like this.  and great art to boot. but after 4 (or three?) plays it just doesn't click with me.  i find the game very 'non-intuitive'.  i want to love it but don't.  i am sure (maybe) that several plays in a row would reveal a good game, but i would really rather play Valley of the Kings if i want a short, interesting deck-builder.

Enjoyed my first play of Flip City, but the game has grown on me further since. I now think that it's one of the most interesting and original deckbuilders out there, and it's certainly one of the most replayable micro games I know. As a two player game (really the only way to play it) it presents a race to the finish in which every card you purchase may spell victory or defeat. You really feel like it is all about the composition of your deck from the very first card you purchase.

Horrible game. Plays far too long with 4 people so don't try to play with more then 3. It would seem to be a child friendly game but that isn't the case. Everyone had issues with seeing their next under their top card. One of the driest and dullest games I've played in a very long time.

This makes a reasonably quick-playing solo game with a fast setup time and interesting decisions. It's also small enough to be very portable. The main flaw is that the theme is relatively lackluster; it has a similar feel to something like Star Realms without the exciting theme.

Micro deck building city builder. This game brings a couple twists. The deck is comprised of two-sided cards that can be flipped by paying the upgrade cost. A hand of cards is not drawn but rather played from the top of the deck until you choose to stop, reach a stop condition or you win. This introduces a press-your-luck element. The surprising game play for me is that the city builder part is by adding cards to your deck for future play. The game does not build on prior turns like most city builders. This allows for a very small footprint to play in small areas which makes this a good camping addition.  It is pretty much multi-player solitaire even though there is a fun screwage mechanic to pass your frowny face residential cards to your neighbors. It's a simple game but it is a good solitaire game to have in your arsenal.

Flip City is a light micro deck building game that is surprisingly deep in strategy and complexity. So far it seems that one of the best strategy is going for Hospitals to then flip them into churches, but I've only played twice so far. I'll be looking at the expansions to see about adding them to my collection as well.

There's a surprising amount of gameplay here, but turns can get a little unwieldy once you start playing 10-12+ cards per turn.  Also, I have a hard time not flipping things over ... it really does take a conscious effort to leave everything facing the way it's supposed to.  As a "push your luck" style game, it's ok, but I think I'd rather play something like Welcome to the Dungeon for it's simplicity.

Hook: A deck building game with two-sided cards, with a push your luck twist.

Fingerprint: Race to the finish game.
Player interaction - Very low.
Strategy - Moderate to high.
Replayability - few times.
Luck - Medium. Risk is built in to the mechanic.
Memory - Moderate. Card counting can give an edge.

Pros:
Rules are simple with a short learning curve.

Problems:
1. Technical. Need to hold deck in hand so as not to see next card in deck.
2. Very low players interaction.

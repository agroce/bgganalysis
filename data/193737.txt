It's more mature than [thing=43443][/thing], but less thematic and interesting than [thing=133437][/thing].  Mechanically, it is solid, but thematically, it is a joke.  

For starters, Uhura and McCoy make tactical decisions concerning movement and discharging weapons.  The Tholians, Romulans, and Klingons all attacking at once is unacceptable.

In the show, 3 Romulan cruisers surrounded the Enterprise in [i]The Enterprise Incident[/i]?  In this game, 3 Romulan cruisers vs. the Enterprise is a joke.  This isn't at all like the original series.  The Enterprise more closely resembles a Borg cube in strength and the game looks like the Battle of Wolf 359.

It was a complete Star Trek fail because this is a theme pasted on to a mechanic.

RATING: 9
What a wonderful implementation of the Panic system! It feels VERY thematic. I love how my family can easily play a short game, medium or long based on how many missions we want to go for. I would REALLY like to see this sell well and result in expansions based on the other Star Trek Shows (Next Gen, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, current Movies) which would include the new ship + missions + characters & game cards.

Next to Castle Panic WITH it's expansions, this is the best in the Panic line. Good use of the theme, with the shields and ship damage tokens, and the institution of the Mission Cards which help each session feel like a proper adventure. Lots of other clever tweaks like the Klingon Captain tokens, the maneuvering rules for the ships, and other things that really amplify the feel of a Star Trek battle (like getting close to that space base for repairs). I actually hope they'll throw more Quest Card type stuff into Castle Panic now, and this is definitely better than Dead Panic or Munchkin Panic, plus a little smoother for solo play. Much fun for me.

My first and only Star Trek game.  Picked this one up over Frontiers as this was half the price and was different enough from other games in my collection.  Interesting co-op game.  Solo seems lacking, unless you either play multiple characters or a solo variant.

Another great entry in the Panic series. Fireside Games does a great job of reinterpreting Castle Panic into other genres and Star Trek is no exception. Be warned, however, that this is NOT an easy game. Cooperation is essential to survival.

RATING: 8
Based on the popular "Castle Panic", this game sees players cooperatively maneuvering the enterprise and going through missions based on the original series, all the while surviving a tower defense kind of system. It's a very fun coop and if you like any combination of star trek, coop games, or the original "Castle Panic", you should definitely try it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I like this better than the normal Castle Panic for two reasons. First the missions add an extra complexity to the game. And second because of just the nostalgia of the characters and the missions as it relates to Star Trek: ToS.

The downtime with 5 just killed it.  I will never play this again with 5, never with 6.  I'd will be willing to try again with 3, but 5 was just too much downtime with nothing to do.

Also, after more thought, the decision space is pretty limited.  You play every card you can.  If you can't play anymore, your turn is over.  There is, from my one play granted, no reason to hold on to a card other than perhaps to trade it to another player that could use 1 on his/her turn.

We love Castle Panic and love Star Wars, so this was a natural fit.  Takes Castle Panic to another level with the individual player rolls and the ability to manipulate the Enterprise.  The missions that must be completed while fighting off enemies are a great addition!

Good cooperative game. I especially liked how the missions changed up the gameplay. Dealing with shield and hull damage can be a bit fiddly though. Plays closer to 2 hours in my experience.

A really tough game that's very attractive and thematic. The crew abilities are very interesting and require serious cooperation between players. My one complaint is how further damage to a destroyed hull section merely results in removed Enterprise cards. I would've preferred that the ship be damaged less easily but excess damage to a section be transferred to an adjacent section; the players lose once all six sections are destroyed.

I liked Star Trek Panic a lot, and it really, really captured the theme of the show, but essentially the only way to increase the difficulty was to make the game longer.  Ten missions just outstayed the welcome of the game too much, and it was too easy at shorter mission counts.

This is a really clever variant of the Castle Panic system, though, and is another I would be willing to play without needing to own it.

Right from the gate this is a strong Coop game requiring lots of optimization of turn and strategising as SPACE is full of bad guys waiting to blow the crap out of the Enterprise.

I like it a lot. My first game was a disaster because I attempted to play it 1 character and got totally demolished. It wouldn't be any fun if it were too easy to win though. Next time I will try 2 or 3 characters. I played Montgomery Scott my first game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
We got pretty well crushed by this game two times. Not really much you can do about it. There are five missions to complete per game and the missions are completed by playing cards with a specific Department symbol. So it's very easy to be destroyed by oncoming ships before you're able to get the symbols you need. Kind of random and boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Super poorly balanced, especially in the characters. Some of the mechanical changes are big improvements over Castle Panic, but that was a pretty weak design to begin with, so this isn't great either. And getting a ton of security officers in your hand... not fun!

Components awesome, really enjoyed first two games. Very thematic, really felt like the Enterprise struggling to survive as it completed missions, attacked from all sides...

(Can't see where in rules it says you have to hit a target to use a card, so we figure you can get rid of cards you don't want to keep by just using them uselessly. Makes sense ludogically and thematically to us.)

The Star Trek theme on top of Castle Panic really works.  The 5 year mission objective is a creative way to decide the winning conditions.  However, this can make the play time indefinite.  We had one game where we kept failing to achieve the currently assigned mission over and over and over.  All the while, we had incredible luck in avoiding to destroy the Enterprise; several times coming back from one hit away from destruction.  The game lasted several hours.

Superior to Castle Panic. More challenging and thematic without drastically compromising the simplistic mechanics. I like the dedication to TOS instead of integrating a multi-generational theme (all Star Trek series). The mission cards increase the Star Trek feel without bogging down the game. In the end, it's still a fast-paced, light game, but the emphasis on TOS theme and slight increase in difficulty increases interest and replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The theme works really well and the gameplay is pretty straightforward, but it just drags on WAY too long for how light of a game it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting adaptation of the "Castle Panic" system to the "Star Trek" universe. Once you get past the Enterprise being a sort of super dreadnought repelling ongoing simultaneous attacks from Klingons, Romulans and Tholians, the theme implementation is actually pretty good, with missions directly taken from episodes of the classic series. The special powers also make sense, although it's a little odd and even frustrating that secondary characters have better powers than the main trio.

Despite the very high level of randomness, the gameplay is engaging and fun when you are doing relatively well. However, if the Enterprise takes too many hits and three sections of its hull are destroyed, you lose the ability to maneuver and things start to go awry. This isn't a problem in itself, as I don't expect to always win. The actual problem is that you only lose if all six hull sections are destroyed or a player cannot draw enough cards to refill his hand, both of which usually take a very long time. After the fourth section is lost, it can be extremely hard to recover, some missions become impossible to fulfill, and the game drags on and on. Failing a few missions (two or three) should be another condition for the players' defeat. The lack of a way to discard unwanted cards also slows the game down and even stalls it sometimes, which should have been addressed during development.

The highlight of the production is obviously the huge cardboard Enterprise that stands in the middle of the board surrounded by plastic shields, lending a special charm to the game. Although a bit fiddly, the way that damage is physically applied also adds to the visual appeal.

I've never played Castle Panic, so wasn't sure what to expect with this game. I bought it based on theme and a prerelease video I watched with my 11 year old. I can honestly say I'm so impressed by Star Trek Panic! It totally nailed the feel of piloting the Enterprise from one mission to the next. Several times I thought we were going to lose, but somehow we managed to complete our five year mission! If the theme appeals to you at all, this is an absolute must own.

Defend the Enterprise from incoming enemies while trying to accumulate the necessary artifacts to win the game. The theme is not only applicable to the game system, but it increases the challenge level in a way that makes the game a lot more fun. Definitely fun for fans of Star Trek and of Castle Panic.

BIG PLUS: theme fits, challenge is increased, easy to learn
MINUS: possible to be frustrated by the level of difficulty

RATING: N/A
A great Panic game while also being pure Star Trek. I love the mission system added to this game. The goal of the game is to complete 5 missions while phasering waves of Klingons, Romulans and Tholians. The missions are all pulled straight from the original series. 
   I love the aesthetic of this game.

RATING: 7
Entertaining coop game for the entire family; as long as that family enjoys Star Trek, the original series. There was a bit of rule confusion. We weren't sure what the "other" ship should have been. The damaged shield tokens didn't fit well on the plastic shields, but other than that, the game is well put together.

The second game was brutal. If you want a quick end of night filler, this is NOT it. So many noodly rules to track. We barely completed 3 missions before our ship was utterly destroyed. What happens when you can't draw from the main deck because of constant boarding and tossing out cards?

Fun, absorbing, challenging and thematic, though not too difficult to learn.  I like the mission cards, and the special abilities of the character cards.  Some missions seem next to impossible, and others are a breeze (all somewhat luck dependent, though).  Each game presents different levels of challenge, more than I have been able to cope with so far, since I've had the U.S.S. Enterprise almost shot out from under me in my three+ games so far, and without a winning game to show for it.  The damage markers and shields did not fit onto the model and base, though.  I had to file them down so as to fit.

Star Trek Panic is a cooperative light strategy game based on Castle Panic that challenges players to defend the U.S.S. Enterprise from enemy attacks.

This is a worthwhile addition to the [family=24821][/family] family. The changes that variable player powers, Enterprise maneuvering and the missions bring to the game definitely make it a different game to Castle Panic, so it'll stay in the collection. 

Difficulty is a bit variable, depending on the missions that you draw and the sequence that you draw them. I also think that difficulty is a little linked to player count - getting easier either side of the 4-player "sweet spot". Though I think that I need a few more games to check this out.

I would rate the Panic games like this:

1. Dead Panic--I like zombies, and it seems to be the most tactical.
2. Star Trek Panic--I like Star Trek, and it has excellent bits.

If you think this is just a re-themed Castle Panic game - you are so wrong! The game holds true to the original Star Trek series. Yes it uses mechanics found in other Panic games, but this one is the best! Fight off those Klingons, face the destruction of a comet, and more; all while trying to accomplish missions in order to win the game.

A vast improvement over Castle Panic. Granted, some of my excitement for this game comes from the theme, but aside from the fact that McCoy's special power is to summon security officers, this game is incredibly thematic. There are a wealth of different missions, and they all really capture the feel of the episodes they're based on. About the only thing about this game that bothers me is the Enterprise model itself, which is a cardboard monstrosity. Tracking damage isn't the easiest thing to do, but it does have a strong visual look to it. This game may go down for me upon repeated plays, but if they support this with more missions through expansions, the replay value will go through the roof.

Based on Castle Panic, in this cooperative game, players are members of the Enterprise, attempting to complete missions and defeat threats on the board. The threats are typically spaceships, like Tholians, Romulans or Klingons. You need to complete 5 missions to win On your turn you use cards to fire weapons or complete missions. 

The enterprise has shields to protect itself ,but they can be destroyed, then the hull can be destroyed, then eventually the card deck can be lost. If you lose the card deck you lose the game. Shields and hull can be repaired. 

It's a light game, but it is fun. I enjoyed my one playing with 4 players. I have never played Castle Panic, but it's fun to work together, the theme is enjoyable for Trekkies.  The players generally shouldn't lose, so it might not be challenging that way, unless you go for 10 missions as stated in the rules.

RATING: 6
I like the Panic series and I love the Star Trek theme. While I do like the game, it suffers from overly clunky, unintuitive rules. Every type of ship moves and attacks differently, and that changes again when they reach the inner ring (whether they board the ship or not). 

I also think the standard game over stays its welcome. A typical game of 5 missions can run over 2 hours, which is a bit longer than I would like for this style of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A game this theme heavy has to carry the theme through, and this doesn't click for me.  The episode based missions are fun, but it just doesn't make sense that you've got a bunch of random enemies, pulled from a bag, endlessly assaulting the Enterprise.  I don't remember too many episodes of the show when the ship was constantly bursting into flame, either.  As far as gameplay goes, it was a bit of a drag.  For a co-operative game, there were too many turns where I had to wrong cards to help anyone, so I sat around watching the aforementioned random ships bombard and board the ship.  I just didn't have much fun and don't see why I would, playing this.

I liked it at as a variant of Castle Panic, but in my one play we got into way more trouble than what would normally see us dead in Castle Panic and still pulled out the win with relative ease. It seems overly forgiving, and if you're going to play a co-op of this length, you don't want to be entering confident of a win. While I enjoy the system, I don't think it warrants the extra half-hour-plus that this version requires. On the positive side, the ability to maneuver the ship to modify the direction in which your hit cards work is very neat, provides more think-stuff, and provides more inducement to talk with the other players as to which orientation is best for upcoming turns. So there are upsides meaning I'd happily play it, but I prefer the simplicity and quicker playing fun of the original.

"Wow. This is a great family Trek game. There are a couple bits that are probably more complicated than they should be, but the theme comes through, and the mechanisms are solid. The swingyness of the missions seems problematic after 5 plays, and it can run long (2 to 2.5 hrs), which lowers my rating from a 9 to an 8. Personally I would prefer Voyager (with it's gender-balanced crew), but I know I'm in the minority there."

What I like:
- 3d Enterprise is awesome, and it fits inside the box (assembled)
- Theme comes through quite strongly
- Gameplay is an improvement over Castle Panic and Dead Panic
- Quite a few missions in the box, so pretty good variability

What I don't like:
- The game runs 1.5 - 2.5 hrs, where I would prefer under 1.5
- Missions can be quite swingy
- Would prefer Voyager setting, or TNG, over TOS (mostly for more female roles)
- My shields are too think for the shield-damage token slots
- My Enterprise model doesn't quite sit snugly in its base
- A few rules seem slightly over-complicated

The more I saw about this game, the better it sounded. Based on my first play my enthusiasm was justified. As long as it doesn't prove to be too swingy, I suspect this will become a favorite for me and my wife. I just wish there were more female roles available to play, but of course that wasn't allowed in the 1960's when the TOS was created. 

My learning solo (2p) game, completing 2 missions, took about an hour. I ended up failing 2 missions before finally winning. Another 2-mission game took 30 minutes, and our first 5-mission game took 90. The next two 2p games took 2 hours each (each with 3 failed missions), and the next took 2.5 hours (with 4 failed missions). I really wish it would stay closer to 60-90 minutes. 

I would put the weight around 2.1, a bit more complicated than Pandemic, but not as deep.

RATING: 5
Most actual "fun" I have had with a boardgame in years. Very thematic, challenging, great components for a reasonable price. A must buy for any fan of the tv show. In fact, I had such a good time playing, I would consider this a worthy buy even if I only ever played it once. Background Music from the original show is a must  (spotify)  for total immersion.

Update: sold. Played four times and that was enough. Once you beat the game, and win/see every challenge (only 18) there isn't much point in replaying. The decision tree is fairly simple and obvious. This is the problem with coops: Beating a game is just not as enjoyable as playing against people. This is theme candy: Like cheap gum, you get a brief blast of sugar here, but it doesn't give you any long lasting nutritional value.

Star Trek Panic is a great twist on the Castle Panic series.  I've Only played this game one time and the two missions seemed to be kinda easy but look forward to the full game with five missions.

This game is fun and thematic. I've nudged my rating down because it can sometimes lock up, so that you don't have cards that you can play but the enemies aren't doing all that much damage to you. Since you can't discard to draw other cards, you just have to wait for the mission timer to run down and hope that the next mission will give you something to do. This doesn't happen every game, but it's a drag when it does happen.

RATING: 6
This is a tower defense game, lightly themed for star trek original series episodes, where the really cool thing about the game aside from the neat papercraft enterprise is the game has the ability to move the castle (so to speak). On a players turn, they can trade and play cards, which will cause the ship to move, or fire, with the goal of preventing the various aliens from destroying the ship, and completing the current objective card. The objective cards keep the game relatively fresh, and it feels properly co-operative with each player getting their own special power, but after three plays of having the game go more or less the same way I felt like this game, while beautiful, didn't have the staying power it needed.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:nostar: Clever or interesting mechanisms

:star: Low or mitigatable luck elements

Tower defense game to protect the enterprise from enemy ships, which attack the ships shields or do damage once they're down or board to destroy a section once they are too close. Hand cards are used to attack in specific direction/distance or to repair or to complete missions. Goal is to complete several missions... And stay alive.

Fun light game.  Captures the theme of the original Star Trek TV show.  Similar to Castle Panic, but a little more depth with the mission capabilities.

Easy to teach and good for ages 7 and up I would say.  

It seems to have a built in can't loose mechanism.  It seems you are getting blown out and feel like you are going to lose, but to kill you off, you have to keep taking damage until you run out of cards, which could take awhile.  This assumes you do get through your 5 missions.  

Despite that it was a fun and easy going experience.

A fun cooperative game, perfect for Star Trek fans - great execution of a thematic Star Trek game. The roles, abilities, events, and dangers are all cleverly pulled from the original series TV show.

Many argue that slipping a skin on a game doesn't change the game. Catan is Catan, Pandemic is Pandemic, Panic is Panic. Wherever you fall on that argument, there is just something satisfying about the castle defense style of game centering around the Enterprise. Enemies appearing as Klingons and Romulans is about as close as you are going to get to being on the bridge of Starfleet's flagship. The ship may be cardboard, but the fun is real.

Played at Friendsgiving. Enjoyed it. Thought we were going to die for SURE, but we won. Downside is once you have destroyed a section of the ship, you can almost use that as a shield. Meaning, it can't take any more damage, so you can rotate the ship to the broken side and it isn't vulnerable to further attacks, only boarding. We used that to our advantage and won.

Star Trek Panic is less of a spin-off game and more of the adult version of its predecessor, Castle Panic. The original Castle Panic is a good entry point for young players with its cooperative nature and light difficult, but a group of adults may find its lack of challenge boring. Star Trek Panic boosts the sense of urgency in the game and has a fair amount of replayability through the character powers, unique enemies, and missions to make each game a bit different.

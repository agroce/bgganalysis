I guess I wasn't supposed to win this playing as the Romans my first time. But it felt so predictable. My high rating baffles me and was probably only out of respect for Ignacy. I do like drafting games and variable player powers, though. It definitely requires a replay, with more risk-taking, and perhaps two-player, before downgrading.

Two things stand out; it's an engine builder and it's (somewhat) asymmetrical in it's strategy. The later (in particular) salvages the game IMHO as it prevents players from just cracking the engine formulas and running the game into the ground. Still possible, but less likely. Driven by cards, each side will ultimately build a slightly different engine that is tailored to their faction's strength and to counter the other faction. In particular, that what the opponents faction is helps (in some way) determine what you should do to counter them; "do they produce lots of gold by require workers? Time to raze their worker production and hamper them." That sort of stuff help gives the game some staying power as each faction will have a weakness and counter that you will need to work on. The cards really save it as it's not a rote execution of each factions strategy; the initial lookout draft and what cards comes up also keeps the game fresh. The solo game is no slouch, and if you're into that sort of thing works really well, but the game shines at 2p. Above that, and I find it drags and it's tough to keep track of what everyone else is doing (although, that's only necessary when razing as there is only so much one can do to stop people outside of that).

I think the three dings I have against it are that it's basically an engine builder (which I find aren't particularly interesting or interactive). It solves the later by asymmetry and ability to break sections of their engine which is nice. Second, while it's interactive in the draft (passively) and razing (actively), that's about it. I get the appeal, it's just not something that turns me on. Last, passing sort of blows (although the exploration tile promos *do* help solve that problem). Still, an ok game and I do enjoy my plays (even the solo mode was interesting and deserving of praise), but it only gets so many plays before it just gets old, for instance, Lewis & Clark has a much more interesting and opaque decision tree, which holds it together, but L&C less interactive which is a trade off.

04-27-2015: After two plays, this could go up to an 8 or further down to a 6 or 5 based on how the next play goes. I've played three of Ignacy's games now (this along with Witcher and Robinson Crusoe) and the overwhelming feeling I've had through three different games and 7-8 hours of combined gameplay is: frustration. They haven't been fun, which to me is a cardinal sin for a board game.

I think this one would probably be best capped at 1-2 players. Restricting it to one action per player per turn makes the game exponentially longer. I need to play a card, so I do an action that gives me resources. Wait. Wait. Wait. Spend those resources to play the card. Wait. Wait. Wait. Use an action to get people. Wait. Wait. Wait. Play people on the card for points. Sigh... this makes me really appreciate games like Manhattan Project where I can do a similar series of turns in about 30 seconds.

It's very much a multiplayer solitaire. Unless someone is killing your cards you don't really care what anyone else is doing. The 45-90 minutes suggested game length is laughable. Our two games so far with three and four players have taken 2-3 hours each. You only go through a portion of your deck so it's very luck dependent on what cards you happen to draw. And hopefully if you were lucky enough to draw a good card you got it earlier in the game rather than later.

I feel this game would be really great if you could cut down on the game length and make the card draws more strategic versus luck-based (ability to look through your deck rather than shuffle and hope). This should also be 90 minutes at most but it's never been close to that for us.

Disclaimer: I usually play as the color red, so both games so far I played with Romans. If there is a combination of cards I should play, I haven't found them yet.

UPDATE 05-05-15: I played it again as a 2 player game with my wife and enjoyed it a lot more that way - significantly less downtime - and played as the Barbarians rather than the Romans.

UPDATE 06-06-15: I played again as the Japanese and won handily, after finishing in last place my first three games. I don't see my rating going up much at all from here. I feel about this game similar to the way I feel about Seasons -- great components, great cards, but in order to win I have to be a jerk, and I hate those types of games.

Was surprisingly disappointed with this one. Very solitaire. Buildings aren't very interesting; produce resources, or spend x to get y, or turn x into VP. Later turns are just a sprawling tree of resource juggling actions that gave me tunnel vision. Good solo game, because other players are basically redundant!

Nothing really new here, but the gameplay is tried and tested and interesting. Becomes quite fiddly after a while though, AP prone, no wonder you stop after five rounds. It really makes sense to employ a time-keeping device so the players don't take too long for their turns. Lots of fun!

Very interesting is that there are multiple races that play differently. This gives substance to subsequent plays.

I have played this game mostly solitaire and I really enjoy it. The solo game is not really challenging as you just have to keep small attention on the AI, but it is satisfactory to see your engine working.

With other players I now have a problem as the first game I play with them I absolutely destroy them. It is hard not to play efficiently and in this game having some knowledge of what is coming is vital.

Excellent components and enjoyable art make this a very round game.

This game is a huge disappointment for me because it has the potential to be amazing. Great components, nice engine-building mechanics, elegant simple-to-grasp rules.. there is so much to like. Oh, and I wanted to love this game, but by the end of the second round of my 3-player game, I already knew the winner of the game - and it was all luck of the draw. We watched as that initial great draw was then compounded... and  suddenly, a player who rarely ever wins our games came away with a runaway victory.  We razed, but as he was playing barbarians, most of his buildings were faction buildings. Another player attacked to disable a building, with the one such card he drew. I drew no offensive cards, but I did make an effort to draft a card that would have increased his lead. And, despite playing Romans, I only drew a couple of production cards. Sadly, due to the way the game is designed, there is both a firm limit on draw opportunities (...we managed not to have a single card in the draft that gave those until the very last round) and very little opportunity to shift strategy. Certain decks demand certain play strategies and if you can't draw the cards, it's a disaster. Still, it was an enjoyable experience and I'm glad that player got a chance to win a game, but I can't see myself choosing to play this over engine-builders with better balance: Viticulture (with Tuscany), Roll for the Galaxy, Scythe... and so forth. I may reconsider if an expansion that fixes this issue comes out.

Font size and iconography are incredibly small and this immediately makes the game look a little amateurish, which is a shame because it's a fairly complex design. That's not to say that it's complex to play - the rules are extremely intuitive. There is a lot of attacking (with a variant ruleset to reduce this, which I think will be ignored by most players). The negative interaction is a downside for me, but I'm sure others will love it. This is straight-up resource-gathering/engine-building and there is nothing particularly innovative here, but it is done well.

1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Lots of powers and combos to explore. Fun to plan out your production cycle. Cards graphics are well done.
DISLIKE: Small text on cards, bleh! High conflict (eye-for-an-eye attacks) is a big minus, especially for the Japanese faction. Some downtime for the players who passed in the round.

OVERALL: Felt a little bit like Nations, but I enjoy the player interaction in Nations better. In Imperial Settlers, I felt the razing to be too confrontational, "eye for an eye", which I cannot stand. Without that conflict, it is too hard to slow down leaders, making some combo engines ominously powerful. Not bad, but I'd rather play something else. Maybe a couple more plays would help.

Cuatro partidas a 2 probando todas las razas, el juego no será la bomba pero nos ha gustado mucho y está muy bien balanceado. Un juego medio de gestión de recursos, cartas, y ciertos combos, entretenido, con posibilidades varias de estrategias y decisiones a tomar. Por ahora mi récord son 85 puntos :D jugando con los egipcios.

La expansión añade más variedad de cartas con nuevas opciones para combos, y la opción de producción abierta. (La carta del volcán, sobra xD. O podría jugarse de otra forma, porque a quien le salga por azar destroza demasiado al otro. O por ejemplo que obligara a destruirse un asentamiento a cada uno cuando saliera.)
Por el precio que tiene vale la pena.

RATING: 7
The funniest part of the game is to figure out new card combos. And best part is that only a limited amount is available to you at the same time. Thus the option space is not infinitely large making the game relatively quick playing. Building your empire and seeing it grow is nice and every round there are a number of tough decisions, too.  All this makes the game quite satisfying.

However, despite of occasional razing and a few drafted cards the game lacks player interaction. Basically the game is a race for points, and in all races you should have a way to block other players. In Imperial Settlers you have none. Ok, you can raze but that is a reaction rather than proactive course of action. In other words, Imperial Settlers is a bit of a solitaire.

Imperial Settlers it's quicker and easier to teach than New Era, but it offers less control and less interaction. For some reason it feels more random and decisions are always obvious. Overall there's no tension, it almost seems like the game plays itself.

Don't let the cutesy art and misleading title fool you. This is a well crafted civ building game by Portal where you draft cards to build the most kick ass empire you can. Sometimes you raise buildings, sometimes you make deals with other cultures, sometimes you exploit your civilizations synergies to achieve good outcomes and depreciate your opponents. It all ends up looking like a bunch of Care Bears trying to murder each other with butcher knives. Fun times.

Interesting card game. Finding ways to chain cool combos is fun, the civilisations feel very different, which is nice. Can be luck of the draw-ish but it *is* a card game, and it can very much be mitigated by drawing more cards. Takes a bit long with more than two people for my liking, but still enjoy it.

I love this game!  Engine-building at its finest!

My rating reflects two competing thoughts/ratings:  I give this a 9 for solo play and a 6-7 for multiplayer (using the rules as written).

Solo Play:  The given solo rules are solid and the official campaign variant pushes it over the top.  Very well done!

Multiplayer:  Good but some individual faction buildings needlessly push at the inherent balance in poor ways.  They enable unusual, destructive measures that don't need to be there.  It's enough that players can raze common buildings (barring the Japanese) - there's no need to upset that by allowing certain factions, having drawn and built certain buildings, to totally ignore that fundamental basis/balance.  I would like multiplayer a LOT more with the removal of some of those uber-destructive buildings.

Overall an excellent game!

RATING: 10
Wow, do I love this game! I like it so much, that I'm ashamed I let it flew under my radar for so long. Maybe my tastes changed over the years, maybe I first needed to see it whether this game had any staying power or expansions... but, after finally playing it, I became addicted to it! I stared playing it on a regular basis, I bought all the expansion and it just so happened that Imperial Settlers became my favorite game of all time!

Imperial Settlers is a beautiful game. It has great wooden components, incredible artwork and a very cool theme, that I very much prefer to the post-apocalyptic one of its older brother. What I find the most exciting about it though is its strategical depth/ease of play ratio. You can explain the game pretty quickly, but beneath a bunch of wonderfully crafted mechanisms lies a game with a lot of choices to offer. The key element of this depth is, of course, the multi-use cards. Every hand in Imperial Settlers is a puzzle. Depending on your strategy, your faction or you specific short-term goals you need to figure out how put those cards at the best use. It might be difficult, you might do mistakes, but it's so damn satisfying when you do it right!

Yet this game has a whole lot more to offer than this! It has in fact nearly the perfect level of player interaction for me. In many video I've seen reviewers complaining either for the excessive meanness of the game or, at the other end of the spectrum, for its lack of player interaction. The reason for this opposite views is that the interaction really depends on you, your faction and on your playing style... and personally I find this to be really great, because I can adapt it to the taste of the other players at the table or to my particular mood that day. Yet the one thing that makes this game reach the next level is the factions! They are not just a player board or a card with a special power... they are a completely unique deck of cards, a totally different style of play. Each faction plays almost like a different game and this makes Imperial Settlers incredibly re-playable!

There, however, are a few things that might be bothersome to somebody. There's some luck of the draw, even if I personally think that it's not so relevant to invalidate the cool elements of the game. There's also a steep learning curve that might scare people away or even make them leave the table with the feeling that a particular faction is over-powered. That's a complaint I've heard a lot already, but I really disagree with it. I believe in fact that, when people think a faction is overpowered, more often than not it's because that one faction was being played by someone who knew the game better.

Criticisms aside, all in all I think this an amazing game and one that, every time I play it, leaves me with the desire of coming back to it soon... and all the different expansions that came out only made it better. Imperial Settlers has now an incredible amount of variability, that keeps bringing me back to it. I like the new factions a lot, the Atlanteans being my favorite, and the mechanisms that they introduce. I like to deck-build and explore new strategies and combos. There's just so much to see in this game! It's definitively my favorite of all time. It's incredible! I love it!

This is one of the best card based civilization games until now. You have four rounds, which you start by drafting cards and then by acquiring the available resource you effectively lay them down in an orderly fashion to build up your county (Japan, Rome, Egypt or the Barbarians). You then may use if able the special abilities provided by these cards to buy more cards and lay down even more of them. Also there is a neat combat system in which you are able to destroy your opponents buildings or even to raize your own and collect some resources (wood) in case of shortage. The mechanics work well, althought the available four civilizations doesn't provide for much gameplay variability.

1st play: Quite a cool game, different race powers, shared pool of cards, drafting some buildings and getting an engine going. The art is appealing and the mechanics are interesting. The game could really use a solid player aid to help learning. Also, first plays can be swingy, more plays may help mitigate this, or it might come down to card draw.

2nd play: I played a different race this time and figuring out how to combo the cards of the race was fun.  Avoiding the pitfalls and trying to build an engine was cool, but it was a little frustrating working to put it all together only to have a critical building killed at the wrong time.  Two of the people at the table felt like their powers were very boring, and that level of disparity between races ends up making the game not as fun for me.  I am interested to try those factions, but I have a feeling they're right about those factions.

[b]After 6 plays[/b]:
Imperial Settlers is a game that I found out about first by the commotion it produced in our local community when it was announced (many people pre-ordered it). After that, I heard that it somewhat takes after the "old" PC game The Settlers, I game which I liked and played while discovering videogames. This last thing made me pull the trigger and buy it. Oh, what a good choice!

I like card games (RFtG is my all time favourite), but I would love to play them less and more boardgames. This game scratches two itches: while building a tableau, you must create an economic engine and generate the resources needed for it.

There are so many pros: the wooden components (resource-meeples), the many ways you can use a card, the different strategies, based on the which faction you play.

Now to talk about the dark side: the downtime and the future of the game. I have played with a maximum of 3 players (just one of us was new to the game) till now, but it took too long for me to ever try it with 4 players (unless they are experienced players). Regarding the future of the game, it looks that it is heading towards a TCG/LCG path. I hate deckbuilding and if that will turn out to be true, I will stick with just the base game.

This is the best new game I have played in 2014, no doubt about it. The most interesting part is that my wife has won just one of the 5 games with have played till now and she still wants to play it.

великолепное качество компонентов, картонные жетоны вываливаются лёгкими касаниями. карты обычные, два деревянных жетона пришли слипшимися. в остальном всё идеально. оформление - песня. четыре художника потрудились на славу.

A surprisingly fun medium-weight game, in spite of the non-existent theme! I like it a lot more than Race for the Galaxy, with which it's often compared. Card-game fans may be disappointed if they play with a strategy of, "I'll do this once such-and-such a card comes up," because there's no guarantee that the card you want will show up! One's strategy must be balanced with a strong sense of the tactical.

The art is OK...if you can actually see it! My goodness, the art, icons and text are awfully small on the cards. Imperial Settlers would also benefit from player aids. The only other complaint I have is the game length of five rounds: seven would have been a lot better. At the end of Round Five, you're thinking, "Hey! I was just getting started!"

Excellent game, and by far the most accessible in the series (51st -> New Era -> Imperial Settlers).  Open-ended freeform asymetric tableau/engine builder where you try and score the most points in five rounds, so simple for people to pick up and conceptualize.  Surprisingly tricky learning curve, and lots of tough decisions to make.  More player interaction than one would expect, and can get somewhat spiteful depending on which cards come out.  Table talk is important.

A 'nice' civ-building card game. 'Nice', but not super fantastic, in my opinion. Easy to teach and learn with good replayability and a fair amount of player interaction for a Euro-style game. Great for those who love combo-ing and min-maxing.

Trzewiczek's most accessible and streamlined attempt at a tableau builder.  Cards are multi-purpose, which mitigates the luck of the draw.  Lack the resources to build that one, then you can raze it to gain the resources necessary to build something else.  Also, with some of the cards you can make a deal to increase production of one resource. In the time honoured fashion, the decisions in this game are about how best to use your cards in hand and on the table to develop a resource (and then victory point) engine.  

Unlike most engine builders, Imperial Settlers has an element of direct interaction in that it is possible to raze opponents' buildings to gain resources and damage their engines. The extent to which razing is used to gather the resources you need or to bash whoever you perceive to be the leader is an interesting judgement. 

There are four factions in the box, each with its own deck.  They certainly play quite differently. A question in my mind is about how strongly the cards of a faction steer your play in one direction or another.    

I have quite enjoyed playing Imperial Settlers.  However, while it all works smoothly, there is a sense of deja vu about this game.  It lacks something fresh to make it really stand out.

The computer civ game look of the artwork is quite jolly.  However, the tiny text on the cards was a poor design choice.  This is an interactive game and I need to know what the cards in your tableau can do.

Δυνατό light-civ καρτοπαίχνιδο. Εννοώ light αν το κρίνουμε σαν civilization παιχνίδι αλλά γεμάτο σαν καρτοπαίχνιδο. Κάθε παίκτης έχει την δικά του τράπουλα με κτήρια της φυλής του αλλά υπάρχει και μια κοινή τράπουλα για όλους. Οπότε οι παίκτες μαζεύουν resources και χτίζουν διάφορα κτήρια, που με την σειρά τους παράγουν περισσότερα resources ενώ προσφέρουν και ικανότητες. Όποιος φτιάξει την καλύτερη μηχανή παραγωγής VP κερδίζει. Κλασσική δοκιμασμένη συνταγή.

Το artwork είναι πολύ συμπαθητικό όπως και γενικά η ποιότητα κατασκευής. Θα ήθελα απλά λίγο μεγαλύτερη γραμματοσειρά στις κάρτες γιατί δεν μπορούσα να διαβάσω τις κάρτες των αντιπάλων. Οι 4 φυλές (Ρωμαίοι, Αιγύπτιοι, Ιάπωνες και Βάρβαροι) είναι αρκετά διαφορετικές μεταξύ τους.

Οι κανόνες είναι απλοί και το παιχνίδι κυλά γρήγορα αλλά παρόλα αυτά τον θέλει τον χρόνο του. Πολύ πιθανό οι πρώτες παρτίδες να ξεπεράσουν το 2ωρο για 4 παίκτες. Να σημειώσω εδώ πως η αλληλεπίδραση μεταξύ των παικτών είναι μικρή παρόλο που μπορείς να επιτεθείς σε κάποια από τα κτήρια των αντιπάλων. Άρα μάλλον είναι προτιμότερο να παιχθεί με 2 άντε 3 άτομα. Ο τέταρτος δεν προσφέρει κάτι εκτός από έξτρα downtime.

Πάντα μου αρέσουν τέτοιου είδους παιχνίδια με κάρτες. Ανυπομονώ να δω τι θα προσθέσουν τα expansions. Υπάρχει χώρος για βελτίωση.

We had a great ampunt of fun in four player playing this, unfortunately the barbarian player was able to break the game with a ton of luckily pulls in buildings and was way ahead in victory points no one was able to reasonably catch up or stop him with building razing.

Not bad, but I felt the game was missing something. The special abilities had not been thought out properly.

Its a great game, but how to categorize it... resource management? well yes there are resources to collect.  Maybe card management? It does feel like there are never enough cards to play so finding ways to get cards is very important.  Simulation... possibly.  You are in fact building up a town tied to one of 4 historical races. 

What do you think?

RATING: 7
Surprisingly easy to learn and play. Raze tokens are few and far between if the cards don't favour you which can really kneecap some things and completely devalue certain cards. Letting you exchange people for them, even at a higher exchange rate, would fix this. Unfortunately the game feels like it's lacking a little something to make it great; something like additional end game scoring like a personal objective - just something to introduce a bit of uncertainty as to what the final score will be as opposed to being able to tell who's going to win by counting buildings. Nice game overall but just not something we really have an interest in keep in our collection. Sold.

Just as solid a game as 51st State. Designed by the same man it both expands and simplifies that game. Which can be a total Catch 22 because maybe what you like is the complexity.

It's a toss up really but a simple decision if you like 51st State but find yourself bogging down in its game play pick this game up instead.

A favor.

- Reglas muy asequibles que se explican en 10 minutos.

- El juego es entretenido, mucho combo de cartas y gestión de recursos.

- Sin ser de civilizaciones tiene un aire de evolución.

- El arte gráfico es muy divertido.

En contra.

- Con el transcurrir de las partidas puede llegar a ser bastante repetitivo.

- Muy poca interacción. No existe apenas forma de bloquear de algún modo los progresos de otro jugador. Sin duda es un solitario multijugador.

- No lo veo a más de dos jugadores. Es costoso controlar lo que uno tiene en mesa, como para estar pendiente de los efectos de las cartas que tienen bajadas los demás.

- Muy dependiente del orden en el que vas robando las cartas de tu mazo de civilización. Si no entran los combos buenos te descuelgas de la puntuación y es imposible remontar.

- Las expansiones no me acaban de convencer. Serían de agradecer nuevas civilizaciones más originales.

What's the difference between a rote Euro cube-pushing conversion game and something enjoyable?  Seems like this game might have that intangible.  My biggest grievance is about the extent to which an early combo can snowball, and how players hands are tied for a while to take-that it back down to reality.  Enjoyed with three, eveb more with two, no interest in four.  Both of the advanced decks (Egyptians, Japanese) seem both more powerful and interesting than the basic decks (Romans, Barbarians).  Update: especially the Egyptians!  Wow.  Viable as a handicapping mechanism.  Kinda sucks to rely on leader-bashing for balance in 3P+, and a new game in 2P.

My first buy at Essen last year (it was the very first thing I did as they opened the doors to the complex), and I won't regret it, like ever ... The rate of plays that this game has had since I bought it says it all. Great push your luck, card drafting resource management game (with a bit of "take that"). Each faction plays differently enough, so the game has huge replayability (besides the common deck is varied enough to also contribute in that aspect). Sure there is the luck of the draw, but at least in the drafting phase it can be mitigated by different ways of approaching it. Enjoying it thoroughly!!

Was not terribly impressed with the game on my first play through, but the more I thought about it I realized I did actually like the game. Resources, card laying, build your civilization based on one of the classics (Romans, Japanese, Egyptians, Barbarians). Balanced, asymmetrical play. For some reason I feel like the new 51st State edition might appeal to me more, and this is a sort of re-skin/retheme of that,  but this is cute, colorful, painless to teach. I am very excited to add the Atlantean faction, the prospect of that partially influenced my change of heart.

Seems to be quite hyped. In fact, it has some nice touches:discarding remaining resources each round, razing of cards, some actions like taking over another player's building.

But in general, with 4 players there is not a lot of interaction and due to everyone focusing on (mostly indestructible) faction buildings in our game, it did not feel tense. Instead, one of the faction sets (egyptian) felt a little unbalanced, but it's a card drawing game, so it might have been a lot of luck. 

Oh, and the rulebook is one of those that go into WAY too much detail. Put in a short version in the next print. ;)

A wonderful card-driven engine building game that is built around a very simple rule set. When I first got the game, I was a bit skeptical for two reasons. First, as a euro-gamer, I was concerned about the ability to attack other players and how that element may introduce meta-gaming. But in practice, attacking other players is costly, gives them a resource (wood), and may be inconsequential depending the card. The second element that concerned me was luck. But because of how cards are handled (You do not lose them... unlike other resources) and how they can combo together, players can simply hold onto the cards until they are able to better utilize them. In this way, a bad starting hand is much less significant. 

As I have played the game more, the one thing I've noticed is that the game can really slow down with competent players. Essentially, the game is about drawing cards. As you draw more cards, you have more options and a greater ability to combo them together so you can play/use/draw-more cards. Thus, situations where players have 15-20+ cards and trying to plan out how they will play them isn't uncommon. But honestly... that's not a bad thing for me. The fact that such a simple game can create such an intricate puzzle only adds to the richness of the game. And turns are still relatively short, as players can only do 1-action per turn. But it does turn a 30-min card game... with some luck... into a 1.5-hour card game... with some luck. While luck is well controlled through how cards are utilize, it's still there and somewhat distasteful in a longer game.

But overall, this is a very clean design with interesting choices. Furthermore, each faction plays differently and only adds to the richness of the game. Combined that with amusing art-work... it's a winner.

I like variable use card games, but this doesn't quite work for me. I don't like the hard five round structure, which has no thematic justification and probably no mechanically one other than to artificially keep playing time within the box. I rather like games in which the players can trigger the end game condition, providing an extra layer of strategy.

Also, for a civilization building game, it does feel too stringy with the number of civilizations. Why can't I be the Greeks or Chinese or something? Any having a "barbarian" faction seem also theme breaking to me. Why can't they be the Mongols or Aztecs or something?

3 players game: very long! No interaction: every player does his actions without considering others' cards. 
On last two turns every player built cards easily making these a no-sense turns.

Moreover, writing on the cards is very tiny.

I was charmed by my first play.  The art's whimsical style and 3/4 top down view is totally fantastic and reminds me a lot of the classic PC series "The Settlers" or maybe also "Travian".

Before this was released I told a friend that this game looked like something that I already own.  Civ-building, tableau-splaying, engine-churning card games just tickle my fancy I guess.

I haven't played it enough to know if it truly distinguishes itself from the likes of "7 Wonders", "San Juan / Race for the Galaxy" or the myriad other games where you can build a well, or a quarry, or a trading post.  

But the first play was fun!

***

2 more plays (one of which was a 4-player game).  I've gotten a few rules wrong so I need to play again.  I'm still quite taken with the overall presentation -- still not sure how it fits in with other tableau builders.

I do like how different the factions are.  I like that players need to evaluate their hand and consider the timing of their actions - taking into account the threat of attacks from other factions. 

Is it enough to keep this one around despite other strong competitors in the same space?  Jury is still out.

****

I need to play this again, but with Deus on the horizon, this one might hit the trading pile

Traded.  Despite a lot of potential ultimately it comes down to this:  Is it better than 7 wonders?  For me, the answer is "no"

Nos nem rossz, de elsőre egy nagyon kicsit csalódás, talán túl nagy volt a várakozás:) De lesz még alkalma javítani, játszogatni fogunk vele most egy darabig. 

Nem tudom egyébként, miért vártam olyan sokat tőle, hisz az 51st state nekem egyáltalán nem tetszett. Olyan semmilyen volt, erőltetett, igaz hogy 1 partit játszottam csak vele, de az alapján nem győzött meg.

Itt viszont mindjárt adva van egy jobb téma (valódi történelmi népek, nem valami unalmas kamu sztori... 51. állam hagyjuk már). Na szóval a jól bevált népek nekem jobban bejönnek, és a grafika is jobb. Mivel 3 éve játszottam a másikkal, átolvastam a szabályát, hogy lássam a különbségeket. Hú tényleg jó nagy a hasonlóság, de azért nem ugyanaz a két szabály. Az 51 kicsit mélyebb, a Birodalmi viszont talán épp ezért letisztultabbnak, egzaktabbnak tűnik. Érdekes, hogy egy nagyon hasonló játékrendszer mennyire más játékot ad, ha a tálaláson változtatnak kicsit. Szóval a kezdő benyomások alapján jóra számítottam.

Mi az ami nem tetszett: először is nekünk a 3 fős parti 3 óra volt tisztán, rengeteg holtidővel. Oké tudom, első parti, de akkor is. Simán lehet, hogy valakinek dupla annyi akciója van, a másik akkor csak ül és nézi.
Emellett minden nemzet kártya pakliban van néhány nagyon erős lap. Nagyon sok múlik azon, hogy kinek (mikor) jön ki ilyen. Pl. a mi partinkban Egyiptom felépített egy a mienknél jobban működő kombót, és mivel nemzeti kártyáin volt, nem tudtunk vele mit kezdeni. Az utolsó 2 körben már látszott, hogy nem fogjuk tudni megfogni, nagy különbséggel fog nyerni. De Rómának és Japánnak is van olyan lapja, amivel eldobathattuk volna a kombójához fontos Szfinxeket, de ezek a lapok nem jöttek. Szóval kicsit nekem olyan a játék, hogy amolyan kőpapírolló jelleggel van mindenre ellenszer, kérdés, hogy ha az ellenfelemnél a kő van, akkor nálam épp a papír vagy az olló... És azért így ez elég szerencsefüggő. De nem akarom a szerencsére fogni hogy szarrávertek:) Egy kombóbajnok tuti azt mondaná, hogy leszarja mit csinál a másik, csinál nála egy jobb kombót. Én viszont eleve nem vagyok valami nagy kombókirály, másrészt ha egy ilyen jellegű játékot pasziánsszal folyamatosan nyerni lehet, az szerintem szar:) Nekem egyébként ez a játék sokkal pasziánszosabb, mint mondjuk a 7 csoda (azért ahhoz hasonlítom, mert olvastam kritikának, hogy az pasziánsz), ott nagyobb hatással vagyok az ellenfelekre, 3 főnél legalábbis.

Most szeretnénk végigpróbálgatni a népeket, mert hallottam olyat, hogy nem kiegyensúlyozottak, ennek utána kell járni:) A paklikat átnéztük, és szerintem mindegyikben benne van a nyerés, de néhány parti után térjünk erre vissza.

A sima rombolást egyébként nem érzem valami komoly interakciónak, általában a saját kézből éri meg rombolni, igazán fontos épületet ritkán tudtunk elcsípni az ellenfélnél. Néhány speckó lap több interakciót visz bele.

Mivel változatosak a paklik, sok jópofa épület van, szerintem sok játék lehet benne, csak ezen túl kell tenni magunkat, hogy a felhúzott lapokon bizony elég sok múlik. Tetszik az, hogy aszimmetrikus a játék, és minden nép egy kicsit más. 1-1 parti alapján nálam mindenképp ez a nyerő az 51-gyel szemben.

Egyébként nekem ez kb. olyan Dicsőség rómának szint, és a jellege is hasonló. A pontszám is egyelőre azonos:)
---
Na most hogy már próbáltam 1,2,3 fővel, kicsit letisztult néhány dolog: a játékidő kb. játékosonként 1 óra (lehet hogy a kieg miatt is, de szerintem nem sokat számít, hogy azzal játszottuk). Ezek alapján 4 fősre tuti nem vállalkoznék. A holtidő is nő a létszámmal, és sajnos többedik játékra sem sikerül leszorítani a játékidőt (ahogy jobbak leszünk, úgy lesz egyre több akciónk). Nekem ez kicsit elvette a kedvem, mert egy ilyen kategóriájú játékokból ne 1 férjen bele egy estébe. Dicsőség Rómának-ból legalább 2-3 lemegy egy este, sőt Egiziából vagy Kemetből is 2-3, annyira azért nem jó a Birodalmi, hogy ezeket 1 Birodalmira cseréljem. Sőt ez már a Goával, Power Griddel vagy Caylussal vetekszik időben, ami mind sokkal jobb játék (és még nagyon sok példát lehetne hozni). Összefoglalva: 1 órás kategóriában egész jónak számítana, de 1 óra/fős kategóriában már középszerű.

Az eddigiek alapján egyébként Egyiptomot érezzük a többinél kicsit erősebbnek. Érdekesség: eddig mindig a kezdő nyert (2 db 2 fős, 2 db 3 fős partiban).

Kipróbáltam a szólót is, nem rossz, de az egyiptomival nem okozott túl nagy kihívást maga a győzelem, talán azért is jött ki hozzá a nehezítő 2 kieg lap a virtuális játékosnak. A játék során egy közös lapot se hagytam kint a kör végére, azokat csak építési helynek használtam, így esélye se volt rombolni. Mondom, szerintem 1 parti alapján egyáltalán nem kihívás.

Just did the basics REALLY well.

The two different zones of buildings is a wonderful idea. Really makes this shine I reckon.

I think the downtime might be too much to play multiplayer. I have played two player a few times and games have almost reached the 2 hour mark. I really wish it were played over four rounds - I think that is enough to try and achieve something on the whole (though I read that the Romans are too disadvantaged by just 4 rounds). In fact, most of my plays are solo over four rounds and it is great that way - my top played solo game. I did try the campaign but found it a bit fiddly. Now I just pick two factions and play them separately over four rounds and see who scores highest. Two highest scores this way are 73 with the Barbarians and 63 with Egyptians. I have broken 50 over four rounds with both Romans and Japanese, but not 60. 
Edit: playing with the first expansion, I have scored 70 with the Romans over 4 rounds now (I have also played a stinker with the Egyptians!)

RATING: 3
Deadly dull engine builder.  Extremely limited player interaction resulting in heads down gaming so you can't even have a chat while waiting for your next turn.  I don't think it's broken as others have suggested, but I'm certainly not about to play it again to find out.

My wife and I both like Settlers the PC game series. I hope she likes this too. I am enamoured with it. The card combos and the civ building feel of the game makes it for me. Each faction plays very differently and has an equal chance to victory. A great one from 2014. Expansions add variety and more replayability.

RATING: 6
This game is pretty, just look at the components and cards. It's a medium advanced strategy with 2 serious flaws, though: big downtime (even with 2p) and the lack of almost any interaction. It means players are building their own villages, trying to get the most points out of them during each turn. It plays like a solo game even with 2 or more players which is not any good. If not the quality of components I doubt it would be such a great success.

RATING: 8.6
An interesting example of a game that has nothing wrong going on with it, has excellent production, illustrations and graphic design, and yet feels like it is missing something that I cannot pinpoint. Perhaps it needed to restrict the players more. I concur with JamesH that the cards needed staging. A good and short game overall that takes very little time to explain.

Imperial Settlers is the descendant of 51st State, a tableau building card game I didn't fall in love with (probably because it fell short in the comparison with Race for the Galaxy, an all-time favorite).

Imperial Settlers has more streamlined rules (and _unbelievably_ a great rulebook! The first time for Ignacy...), and more different factions than 51st State, and seems more appealing even if it swapped a cute computer-like quasi-historical theme for an actual rich post apocalyptic setting.

Gameplay is intuitive, enjoyable and smooth, and would be almost great if the graphic design wasn't so totally screwed: icons and text are soooo tiny! And, in such a game of tableau building, where you should be able to see what other players actually have in play, this is a sizeable obstacle to playability...
This is a shame, because graphics are actually enjoyable when you look at the cards in your hand, but absolutely not readable at the other side of the table!

Anyway, I love this kind of tableau-building game. And Imperial Settlers is a very very good game in its genre!

Played a 2 player game with my son and believe we played correctly.  It is obvious from the get go that the game is going to require a good 2 dozen plays or so before I have a good feel for it.  I feel that the game will feel more fun as I become more familiar with it.  So far, I'm going with a 7 as while I wasn't impressed by the game thus far, it left me feeling good enough where I want to play it again.

Initial Impression: The light, almost cartoony artwork in this game hide the serious engine building elements. Each of the four factions seem to emphasize different methods of play, highlighting various resources. Resournce management and conversion didn't seem overly fiddly, as it does in so many other euro games. Cards are a resource and the choices of which card to draw/use/discard can be excruciating. Overall, this is a fun game that works well with two people. I'd love to see what the dynamics would be like at the 3-4 player count.

It's amazing just how good this game is and it's just using cards.  I cannot say enough just how good this game is.  It's nothing as deep as TTA's which is a great game on its own but it's got all the things you want in a Civ game but as a lighter game.

Update: dropped a few notches for us mainly because the lack of variety.  Once the next big box expansion comes out I think it will have enough variety.

Elk bouwt zijn dorp uit met kaarten van eigen deck en gemeenschappelijk deck.
Hiervoor spaar je grondstoffen, en kan je ook plunderen.
Op het einde van elke ronde (5 stuks) moet je alle niet-gebruikte GS afgeven, dus je kan best elke ronde optmaliseren.

Het spel heeft veel leuke elementen en bevalt me wel.
Misschien zelfs om alleen te spelen?!

Minpunt: tekst op kaartjes is te klein gedrukt.  Verschil tussen algemeen gebouw en volksgebouw zou duidelijker kunnen.  Algemeen kon de vormgeving beter.
Op de inhoud weinig aan te merken.

Nadeel aan spelen met 2 is dat je vooral heel veel met jezelf bezig bent.  Met 4 vrees ik dan weer dat het lang wachten is op je beurt.  Te bekijken.

A very enjoyable and puzzley hand and resource management game with a flavor of civ building.  There is a small amount of multi use cards (faction cards can be played as "deals" for resources or to the tableaux for their abilities, common cards can only be played for their ability but can be razed (destroyed) for a one off award of resources and or points.  There are 4 different factions to play with and explore in the base game and now to extra factions available through expansions.  I like Bruges, San Juan and Race for the Galaxy much more and this feels a little similar to Bruges but different enough to have its own place in my collection and this is a great game.

RATING: 6
:d10-2:

UPDATE: The rating took a big hit - going from 8 to 6, with the potential to go down to 4 - after my most recent play. There's just not enough interaction to warrant the incessant micro-actions. And the tensions in gameplay aren't as interesting as I had originally supposed.

OLD COMMENT: Imperial Settlers is the latest reimplementation of the 51st State game system. Some have called it watered-down, but in my opinion, the refinements obsolete earlier versions. Resource management is smoother, the asymmetrical powers are more interesting, and the mechanics are more intuitive.

My only real issue with the game (and it's a considerable one) is that there is very little direct interaction for the majority of the game, yet you still have to take a billion micro-actions, one at a time, just in case the order of player actions will matter. With experience, I'm hoping that this both speeds up and proves more relevant.

Also, there is enough 'take that' in here that I would not want to play this multiplayer (although my first game was, in fact, with four).

I'm definitely going to picking this one up.

Love this game. I used to own 51st State and it was clunky and so many tokens and it just wasn't quite there. This is a great game that takes the basic mechanics of that game and makes it into something fun, light-hearted, but with deep strategic decisions. Loved it. Seriously. 

EDIT: raised my rating from 9 to 9.4 because this game has grown on me more and more!

Lightly-themed civilization game, essentially hand management card game. It gives off a similar vibe to Terraforming Mars for me, steady engine builder as the number of actions you can perform vastly increased every round. The cutesy artwork makes the game more appealing to me and I like how all the factions have their own personal deck so you must play to your factions' strength. I think I'll like the game more once I'm more familiar with the cards! 

One thing I had to nitpick about is the font size, which can be easily enlarged since there's so much space on the cards. I think the game is actually best suited for 2-players, can play a game under an hour and still have the feeling of satisfaction of a heavy game.

I had avoided the game for a while as I didn't care for the art style. After playing the game though, the art quickly becomes irrelevant. Having the different player powers is a plus. The game play goes quickly at first but in later rounds, as you build your engine, your turns can take a while. The components are solid and the game has several expansions. Very enjoyable.

First Play: excellent explanation and so our three player game started quickly. Different tribes have different set up and production so it's hard to see who is doing well.

Progress is determined by which cards in you deck come out. In my case swords and extra cards were in very short supply so I struggled. I managed to build five Roman building vs whereas the Barbarians built ten.

A game I would be happy to play again but I wouldn't buy.

Rating based on 2x 2P, 1x 4P and 6x Solo. No expansion. // This is a great game. Beautiful. Lots of fun Solo, milking the last bit out of your cards. Great 2P, although can be very mean and lucky (if you draw unlucky, ya toast). Even the 4P round added some different aspects. The winner won, because the others didn't pay enough attention to his machinery, so with 4, you really have to pay attention. 

Definitely going to look into the expansions.

Imperial Settlers is card based, lower complexity, Civilization game.

Each of the four powers has its own strengths and weaknesses.  I am not sure how balanced the four powers are; however, a whack the leader strategy generally balances things out.

Action turns in a four person game can take some time to complete.  I found it to be a little long for what it is.

Going forward, I expect I will prefer Imperial Settlers as a solo or two player game.

I thought this looked pretty good; I'd watched a review and it intrigued me. Having played it, I realize that it's not for me. I invested in production and then had it decimated by the Romans on the second turn and my game was basically over. That's the aspect of a Euro game that doesn't work for me. The player was absolutely right to do it and had I been paying better attention, I probably could have made sure not to let that happen. But, I didn't do that and it wasn't a great experience. Even if I could handle it in the future, I'd probably not want to bother trying.

In my second game I realized what was my problem with the game. I don't like to pay for cards the way it is realized in this game. I pay ressources I could use for building for a card that may, or may not be good. First this feals wrong to give something you have for a gamble. The problem is it works out. Secondly I am stuck with the card I get. This way the game determines a lot of my decisions. I can still raze, or play the card. Overall it seams that this random event is more important than my own decision. I think that is why I do not like the game.

This game keeps getting better every time we play. It's pretty light and easy to teach, but still gets players thinking strategically. The artwork is gorgeous and the game design is very tight and well balanced.

Edit: Having played it solo a few times I realized that there is quite a lot of luck involved in this game. It doesn't feel that way when you play the game but it certainly is the case. It's not a big deal but I still was disappointed to see that luck was more important than strategy in this game.

Good, but also rather random. Knowing the decks better would decrease the lack of control I am feeling at the moment, but I am not honestly sure if I want to put the work in to get to that level. It is certainly quick, and if you don't win the first time there usually the opportunity to get revenge by playing one more time, but we tend to move on to another title instead. Kind of doubt I will keep this one actually.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
What a cool card game!  I have not played 51st State or New Era, and have always wanted to, but it's not really something I can bust out with the wife.  This one I can, and it seems to play well with 2.  I am a bit concerned on 4p, as it seems like their could be a bit of down time, but my guess is 3p is the sweet spot.  The factions do feel very different, and am looking forward to exploring them all more.  I also REALLY liked that this game isn't multiplayer solitaire...there is a good amount of interaction in this one!  I know there are  planned expansions of this one, but my one concern is there might not be enough in the initial "core set" to really make the game shine.  Initially I am at an 8 on this one, and I think it's on the rise, but we'll see with more plays...

RATING: 6
It's a very tight variable player power and economic game of min/maxing.  You start with a small income every turn and need to try to build it into something great through construction of public and personal buildings (cards) that provide actions/abilities.  In this regard, it's a tactical puzzle game in which you do the best with what luck of the draw give you; however, the payouts and trade-ups are small enough that it's a rather painful (blood from a stone) min/maxing efficiency puzzle, and it can be slow and plodding even with players that aren't prone to AP because the gains each turn are so small/incremental.  There's some interesting stuff going on, and I'd like to try it again, but I'm worried that the faction decks are too dissimilar (making it hard to teach newbies) and that the game is too long, considering the luck-of-the-draw and possible turn order advantage in the card draft each round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game is amazing. I was ready to give up after a couple of plays, feeling the game was too luck of the draw driven. After about the third game, it clicked. A lot of thought and decisions packed with a great engine-building mechanism.

The campaign mode is great. It's difficult for me to get a group to play this game with (a little long and difficult), but my 12 year old loves it as well and we have played several games together.

To this point, I've only played with one faction. And I will many, many more plays out of this faction. Then there are three more in the base game alone!

I would recommend this to anyone who takes gaming seriously.

I usually play games solo first so I can get the rules down and make sure my first play with other gamers goes smoothly.  I played this game about 20 times solo!  I just couldn't put it down.

Very good game, I like the negative interaction, very mean interaction between players it provides :) I was a big fan of "The Settlers" when I was young so I find this very attractive :) If You don't like mean strategic decisions avoid to buy this game. Overall this is my favorite game by Ignacy Trzewiczek.

I can't imagine this game played by more than 2 players. It must be very long and chaotic.

Oh a wonderful low interaction tableu builder. Let's compare it to RftG:
 - slower
 - less freedom
 - more escalation
 - direct interaction via removal
 - more random
 - more tactical (order of actions is important!)
 - no role selection
 - better looking
 - more variety
 - better feeling of development
 - asymetric factions

Race has the more refined mechanics, but IS has a more epic and satisfying feel to it, when your action / production chains become very powerful towards the end of the game.

Fine card game with a little interaction, a little luck and average strategic planning. You can attack other players if they are winning. Still, building prices are similar and small, making resource management less important.

Not a bad game but just didn't click for me. Romans seemed more powerful than the other factions and the lack of knocking off faction buildings creates a bit of a run away leader issue. I like 51st state's game and theme better and since these are the same game I am giving this one up.

This is a fantastic game. I disagree with anyone who says that this game is boring in later rounds or drags, I find that it gets more intense. This game also has one of the best solo variants I've ever played, especially with the (free) addition of the campaign mode that adds lots of depth and complexity. I love it and find myself always wanting to play this game.

I bought this for the solo mode to practice playing card based games. I think I'm getting better at not being frustrated by how the card draws play out but I still need to see versus other people. 

Played a solo game and got 68 points with the Barbarian faction. Right now I'm nervous to try the other ones but I need to stop being silly! I told myself I can't buy the other 2 factions until I play all 4 in the base game and play with other people to see how it feels against real opponants. But honestly it'll be nice to have a good solo game to play.

Solid game, with nice engine building mechanics and a decent amount of direct player interaction. I think the fact we played with 4 players, 3 of which were having their first game, and that we subsequently took 3 hours to play dampens my rating for this game. If we could get the same amount of game in half the time, I could see this being an 8.

I'm not quite sure how I feel about Imperial Settlers yet. I totally bought it based on hype and because I heard it was similar in some ways to one of my favorite games: Race for the Galaxy.

I like that you can use cards for multiple things and I like the producing and spending different resources (which is different than RftG). Having two decks (common and faction) adds some more tough decisions.

Caveats: I have not played enough to know the faction decks thoroughly (like I know what I could be fishing for in RftG) and I've only played the Barbarians and Romans.

Conclusion: So far I think I'd rather just play RftG or Archipelago? RftG plays quicker and has the benefit that I know all the cards while Archipelago does the whole resource collection and civ thing better (and not that much longer with only 2 people).

My wife really likes Imperial Settlers so that means at this point it's here to stay

I'm leaving myself space to say I was wrong once I play more and play the other factions :)

UPDATE: I traded it away because it just didn't see enough play. It was too slow for what it offered :/

Tous les vieux briscards de l'informatique des années 90 ont connu le jeu vidéo "The Settlers". Un jeu où on amenait son peuple à la prospérité. Et bien Ignacy Trzewiczek (A prononcer à haute voix), l'auteur talentueux de Robinson (entre autres) remet ce jeu au goût du jour avec Imperial Settlers. Je ne vais pas vous le cacher, il va falloir développer sa civilisation. 4 différentes (Romains/Barbares/Egyptiens/Japonais). Et il va falloir faire vivre nos petits colons avec des cartes, et pleins de pions ressources. A découvrir.

   I judged the box by its cover & avoided this one for many, many months...

   With a pace that accelerates as the game progresses, Imperial Settlers is an enjoyable game with minimal downtime that is not all that difficult to teach.  The artwork is fun, consistent, and well done.

   Unfortunately, more time should have been devoted to play-testing this (and from what I hear its expansions), because I believe the factions are imbalanced.

Evaluo el juego solo habiendo jugado al modo solitario y las impresiones son bastante buenas. Con algunas partidas ya van controlándose las cartas y generando buenos combos. La mecánica del juego solitario está bastante lograda pero para subirlo el rating necesito probar el modo a 2 jugadores ¿Alguien se atreve? Los próximos pasos serán probar las FACCIONES complejas (EGIPCIOS y JAPONESES) mientras busco rivales y estudio el modo CAMPAÑA que liberaron los creadores. Tengo muchas ganas de jugarlo más a ver si me lanzo a por alguna expansión.  La de los ATLANTES me llama pero 30€ sin haber jugado al modo multijugador es precipitarse sin necesidad.

I've played a bit of 51st State again recently, and I think the thing which makes the various iterations of that game superior is the "rule of 3". You can't just ride one killer combo to victory; good combination get played out and you have to always be looking for the next upgrade to you tableau. In Imperial Settlers, you *can* just ride that awesome combo you got on turn 1 or 2 for the win; each deck has a few killer combos in there and you just want to draw them fast.

Plus 51st State and New Era just have vastly better theme :)

---

As I play it more, Imperial Settlers is losing its grip on me a bit. I still like it and am happy to play it occasionally as I have friends who are fans, but the painfully bad usability throughout the game - tiny icons, ludicrous font sizes, even the readability on the fonts is poor - is just such a drag, especially since awareness of what's going on in other players' tableaux is fairly important. Also, each faction tends to revolve around a couple key buildings and combos, and players who just draw the combos early - there isn't much you can do to cycle cards if you don't get what you need - will be the ones who are in it with a chance to win. Like 51st State, the early turns are really key - if you can't draw a production building early, or some other bootstrap, you will be lacking options for the rest of the game and there just isn't much you can do about it. 51st State had a similar dynamic, but because it was a smaller game it seemed less painful there. Finally, Imperial Settlers is mostly a puzzle-solving game; you have a hand of cards with building costs and benefits and you need to figure out the right usage and order for each card to squeeze the most out of them. There just aren't enough useful combos in the card space (combined with too many relatively uninteresting cards) to really reward creative play.

Anyway, that sounds terribly harsh, and in fact is probably harsher than it needs to be. I'm probably more frustrated with Imperial Settlers by the fact that it's such a near miss, and by the stupid decisions on the presentation front. In fact I still find it enjoyable, it's a decent tableau/engine building game, but certainly vastly inferior to its cousin-games San Juan or Race for the Galaxy (those games are, of course, total classics). I even think it's a step backwards from 51st State. Sure, the icons in 51st State could be confusing, but at least you could *%^#ing see them.
---
I like Imperial Settlers but I find it oddly less compelling than 51st State and its follow-ons. Where 51st State had an actual interesting and imaginative setting and world, and gameplay that made some sense in that context, Imperial Settlers is just generic computer-gaming quasi-historical empire-building with actually quite minimal flavor and certainly no resemblance to any real-world empires. The sad thing is, Imperial Settlers' totally generic and pasted-on theme seems to be more appealing to people than 51st State's actually thoughtful world-building.

Better fonts, larger icons, and generally less amateurish presentation throughout and more flair in the faction design could easily earn this another ratings point.
---
*Very* similar to 51st State, although with better iconography and a very slightly streamlined system. If you liked/didn't like 51st State, it's hard to imagine you'll feel that much differently about Imperial Settlers.

Absolutely brutal fonts, though - significantly less readable than Dominion, and that's saying something. Text size is punishingly small, even some the icons are hard to distinguish at anything further away than in your hand. Absolutely unbelievable, actually. Portal is not a new kid on the block, they've been around a while, they should know better than this sort of idiocy.

I love engine building games, and I also love games where you get what you get and make the best of it, so Imperial Settlers is right up my alley!

There does seem to be some potential for a runaway leader (we had a game where Egypt just trounced everyone with nothing anyone else could do about it), but I'm hoping that's the exception rather than the norm because I love everything about this game otherwise.

The multi-use cards are great and really make you think about the best way to play any given card, and the player interaction keeps you on the edge of your seat, hoping no one messes with your plans.

I really look forward to playing more, and also seeing what great new factions will be released in the future!

Imperial Settlers is well designed and I enjoy it, but I find it overstays its welcome at times for a tableau engine builder.  The game is certainly paced and balanced around the five rounds but when the game is stretching past 1.5 hours it's a bit much.  

I'm also unsure if it does anything really that innovative or new.  That's not a deriding comment but I don't see this one staying in my collection long term as there are other games I'd rather hit the table.

I had been itching to play this game for quite some time, and had watched various videos showing how it should be played.  Glad I did, because it meant I could launch in to the game very quickly.  It is very simple to play, but I am glad to see it has a lot of replayability in it, especially with a couple of expansions, which it doesn't necessarily need.  I want more of this game and I am looking forward to even trying some more 51st State.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 2 players as the Romans:

This is a nice little engine building/tableau game. It's hard to say based on one play whether or not it really outclasses any of the many existing games in its genre, but I would happily play it again.

The asymmetric element is the most unique part of the game but also what makes it so hard to judge after just one play. These types of games only tend to shine once you're familiar with the possible combos, and I'm definitely not there yet. With an asymmetric game, it's even harder as you want to have a good idea of what your opponents are capable of too.

I initially shied away from this game because of the "take that!" element (love direct conflict in games, but I find "take that!" stuff to be a poor way to go about it 99% of the time) but it actually handles it pretty well. The Razing mechanic works for two reasons: (1) the whole game is setup such that you're constantly tearing down your common locations to build buffer faction ones. So your enemies aren't tearing down something you were going to rely on for the whole game; they're merely doing something sooner than you intended forcing you to adjust your strategy for a different pace and (2) timing is EVERYTHING in this game.

Because you have a lot of flexibility around when you take different actions, strategizing purely around how you time your actions is absolutely key in this game. You're always optimizing your future turns in your head, and if you're smart, you can sometimes use this to avoid being razed at inopportune times. So while it's hard to be truly defensive, you do feel some sense of agency around when you get hit.

This game is quite a bit more fiddly than something like San Juan or Race (well, now Roll) for the Galaxy. There's an awful lot of just grabbing resource bits, shuffling them around, cleaning them up - it feels a bit much for such a quick, light-ish game. Given my preference for elegance I would be surprised if I ended up liking this game as much as those but for now it's really too early to say.

Great quick playing civilization card game with some cool art. It's a race to try and build a resource engine and whoever gets their engine built first usually wins, and there's not much anyone can do to stop it. It's basically a solitaire game because of the lack of interaction. The first 2 rounds of the game are kind of repetitive, it's the last 3 rounds when your faction starts to take shape. There's quite a bit of random card draws in this to discourage some players. My favorite aspects of the game are the quick setup and the quick gameplay, get a lot of civ gaming packed into a 5 round game.

Rated 8 after two back-to-back plays. I was hoping this game would deliver a fairly meaty card tableau type game, and so far, so good. My game group was interested, so I ended up playing this twice... once as barbarians and once as Romans. 

This is a slick running engine, with clearly defined actions, straightforward rounds (draft cards, gather resources, take actions... next round!) and a reasonable playing time. It strikes me that this might run so smoothly because it's essentially a 2.0 version of 51st State (which I've not played).

Everyone that played it enjoyed it, I think, and I look forward to trying the Egyptians and Japanese.

Update: Ultimately, I traded this one away. Each play I found it a little less interesting. I found myself wanting to play something like Glory to Rome instead, where the role selection is more interesting. With Imperial Settlers, it turns into "you take an action, I take an action, you take an action..." little decisions that don't really impact the other players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really happy to have this one even if I almost got beat by 50 points in my first game. It definitely is an engine building game and the 5 rounds seem just about right. It seems very important to get as many production cards out early as you can so you have enough resources to get many buildings out and the appropriate actions. I like how all the buildings work and interact, another hit from Portal!

My only worry is a player could be behind and not able to catch up simply due to the lack of production buildings they are able to get. I love the theme, the play time for 2 is just about right for us (~75 minutes) and the different factions provide some great variety.

The problems of this game are lack of interaction, too small font size, luck card drawing and imbalance from turn orders.  If there are 3 players, the last player will miss one turn to be the first player to choose the cards at the lookout phase.  The asymetric power of each faction is great, but it also depends on the luck you have during game play.  Whoever gets the combo first who will gear up with full engine to achieve more score.  
If you cannot obtain some great production cards in the first round, you may miss a lot of golden opportunities.

The game seems to be balanced for two but plays up to four. The game takes no consideration for how the game will play with more then two players. Cards that give something when an opponent takes a certain action are extremelly strong in 4 player games and cards that allow you to attack faction buildings are cool in two player games but are bad with more.

Even when playing with two players most of the game feels like multiplayer solitaire.

The game has the illusion of being asymmetrical. The factions do have different buildings but you don't feel like you are doing anything different. Yes the Japanesse get food and Egyptians get gold but what they do with those resources doesn't feel any different. They both use them to build buildings and generate points. Even the Barbarians that focus on swords you'd think they'd be pretty aggressive and want to fight but nope. The more efficient option is to raze your own buildings to gain points which makes all the factions feel very samey.

The biggest problem is the order in which you draw cards. Through the course of a game you should be able to draw through most of your faction deck (and if you are lucky enough to get a building that allows card draw you should be able to make it easily through the whole faction deck). However, drawing certain cards at certain times has such a huge swing in how well you will do in the game. Cards tend to be either geared towards the early game or the late game and you have no control when you will get these cards. It would have been really nice if the faction deck was split into two and you'd draw from the first pile for turns 1-3 and the second pile for turns 4-5 or something like this.

I want to give the game a couple more tries with two players but will probably not play again with four.

Has moved beyond 'Cult of the New' appeal, which I initially feared it may have been victim of. But not by much. I particularly enjoy that each card has multiple uses, the assignation of colours to places (which has an effect on other locations), and the variety between factions is readily discernible (my personal choice is the Egyptians). There is a lot of game here, with some good tactical decisions underpinning every round. Charming artwork compliment the theme nicely (and the insert is luffly and amusing), but... gameplay get repetitive quickly.

Dull, hollow-feeling quasi-empire building game that never really makes it on any front for me. The building part never comes through for me (theme is just not there which even variable player powers cannot revive), tacked-on "take that" measures only annoy, odd resource-management rules just puzzle. Calling it "insipid" seems too harsh but I cannot think of anything positive to say about this game.

Played in two, three and four player and I'm really pleased to say it's been fantastic fun every time. We're really only just starting to learn the most beneficial card combinations, but the fact that each faction plays differently means it's a different game every time. Recently had a game with the expansion and enjoyed it even more.

UPDATE: About to be listed on Ebay. It's too long even as a two player game.

RATING: 9
A really good asymmetric game. The different races all use the same mechanics but do play differently. the game heavily rewards experience. players familiar with their race and its deck will dominate less experienced players. it also seems to me that strong players can do well with all the races.

very simple game to teach. if you are familiar with New Era it is essentially a reimplementation with better iconography & scaled down complexity.

one argument against it is that you could argue that it's a bit solvable. there are without question optimal ways to play each of the races.

Without the "three slot rule" from 51st State, this game is too luck dependent. If another player gets a strong opening hand, then there is little one can do about it. Raising or attempting to mitigate luck with more draws won't do enough. The rich will get richer.

Very fun little game.  The barbarian stealing resource card was great, the deal and production phase is fun, I even liked the raze to build new thing action.  I was thinking of buying for solo play but after having only played a 3 player match, this is easily a great multi player experience.  Solo may still be fun but like most games, with buddies is always better.

Just really, really dull and a bit broken with the super power that you may or may not happen to draw. As others have mentioned, there is a 'way' to play each race and it's too restrictive. The cards are too cheap, especially the super powered ones, the text is too small, the gameplay too repetitive (especially during the 'kill me now' later rounds), and it's just generally boring. Nice artwork, that's about the only thing going for it.

51st State at its core.  More family-friendly in theme and art.  I prefer, after one play, 51st State due to theme and more depth of play.

Biggest complaint:  the fonts on the cards are WAY too small.  KUDOS  to Portal for not just using symbols, but the font is just not readable across the table.

Enjoy this, but I prefer it 51st/New Era a bit more.  More game in those, and more room for clever play.  But, sadly, most folks don't want to play 51st due to its theme and iconography (can't blame them on the icons).

RATING: 8
Well presented game from Portal.  Graphically similar to the old Amiga/PC game "Settlers", which was a draw for me personally.

Game seems well balanced, with each faction being tuned towards different approaches - Barbarians being more aggressive, Japanese being defensive etc.

Relatively easy to teach.  Quite a lot of text for people to read which can slow rounds down a little.  Game also requires quite a bit of table space, especially with 4 players.

I haven't witnessed a game of this where either someone steamrolls to victory, or anybody falling too far behind.  Japanese/Egyptian factions are a little more complex than Roman/Barbarian, but not by much.

What starts out as a regular snowball engine builder with zero interesting innovations [i]stays[/i] a regular snowball engine builder with zero interesting innovations. Resources = cards + resources; repeat ad finitum; cards = VP; done. To be honest it's not all that bad, and the amount of material supplied with the game has a nice appearence. That all said and done... the game has Issues.

One is that fonts and icons are ridiculously small, and impossible to read upside down. Yes, you do need to look at what others are up to from time to time; especially if you are [i]not[/i] a player who plans on playing this title so often he knows the cards by heart. Another is that the game begins to drag seriously once rounds 4 and 5 are here. There is very little game to consider save efficiently squeezing points from the engine built up and the cards still in hand and whatever is left from the resources. (Of course, people who like engines will love this spiralling-out-of-control feeling.) And the third and most important is luck of the draw. The point to consider here is not really the average case, where it can be shown without doubt that most actions are 'balanced'. No, what needs consideration is the [i]timing[/i] of the various draws, for example when one player gets agressive cards operational earlier than the opposition, or when good card combos are able to make it earlier to the table than the opposition. The positive feedback loops in Imperial Settlers make it virtually impossible to retaliate in an appropriate fashion if not straight away. In other words: it's not a problem that nasty cards, or some good combination [i]will[/i] be drawn. No, it is that the factions will not draw these [i]at approximately the same time[/i], when doing something about it takes the least amount of effort, and when damage is still minor enough to be repaired. There is nothing in the game to deal with this discrepancy, so probably the best solution is simply to limit the number of players so that the effect, intended or not, is minimised.

All in all I find it curious to play such a game with a present element of conflict, and then read on the box that it is a cardgame with [i]civilizations to care about[/i]. Like hell we care. Shamelessly beat opposition to a bloody pulp if you have the opportunity, that's what this game is about.

Kolejna rewelacyjna gra stworzona przez Ignacego Trzewiczka, zbiera same pozytywne opinie w recenzjach we wszelkich serwisach planszówkowych. Gra jest pięknie wykonana, obrazki na kartach są opracowane z najdrobniejszymi detalami, a drewniane znaczniki nie mniej urocze. Osadnicy są grą łatwą do nauczenia, co nie znaczy nudną! 4 cywilizacje i mnóstwo kart sprawiają, że każda rozgrywka jest inna i pasjonująca. Wariant 2-osobowy jest bardzo przyjemny i nie trwa zbyt długo (ok. 40 minut). Tytuł świetnie sprawdzi się dla par, ponieważ gra zawiera i pierwiastek męski (budowa imperium, podbijanie przeciwnika), i żeński (spokojna rozbudowa, produkcja dóbr). Gra bardzo dobrze się skaluje, jedynie przy większej ilości osób wydłuża się czas rozgrywki w związku z turami innych graczy. Wszystko świetnie się dopełnia, a cywilizacje są na równym poziomie i wymagają odmiennego podejścia. Idealna również do gry solo.

Incredible, after only a few plays it's quickly becoming a favorite game.  Extremely important to have a good understanding of the rules - production buildings/deals generate their resources immediately when you play them!

One thing lacking at this point is the absence of a true 'peaceful variant' as even the peaceful version still includes buildings that razing/steal opponent deals. If future expansions alleviate this with replacement cards it'll bump the game up to that shiny 10.

Lovely chaining-puzzley-building-things-and-swapping-resources-around. The different decks for each kingdom give them very different feels. And there's enough interaction give the sense that you're in a shared world (and to occasionally throw plans for a loop).

But man, those chains can get long, and there's the potential for loads of downtime if you pass early in a round. (At least you can go get a snack? :\ ) I'm apt to avoid this at 4p, could be convinced to play it 3p, and am actively interested in trying it at 2p.

(Also, the cards have terribly tiny print. Tricky to read right in front of you; nigh-impossible across the table.)

Me parece una genialidad! Primero comentaré un problema, del que se queja mucha gente: Bola de nieve. Como un jugador pille ventaja en los primeros turnos, va a ser MUY complicado quitársela, sobretodo si esa ventaja viene de sus edificios de facción y no está jugando japoneses. Pese a ello, las posibilidades que ofrece el juego, los movimientos y gestión de recursos y las diversas opciones que se plantean cada turno hace que cada turno sea un reto, intentando maximizar el motor para conseguir la máxima ventaja posible. Atentos! No es tan ligero como sugieren las desenfadadas ilustraciones! 
EDIT: Los bandazos que puede pegar el robar buenas cartas hace que no mire a este juego con tan buenos ojos...

Growing your empire and finding the best combinations to maximize your resources and VPs is really satisfying, while the different factions offer some nice replay value. However, due to player interaction being minor and usually not even worth its cost, Imperial Settlers is actually a multiplayer solitaire with horrendous, ever-growing downtime. Since there's an official campaign mode available for free, I'd only recommend it as a pretty nice solo game.

A fun card based game where each player is a different nation with your own deck of cards. These cards represent buildings you want to add to your civilization, combined with cards from the common deck.

Drafting each round gives you common cards, you get to draw from your faction deck each round as well and then the buildings give you the resources you need to build them, or you can sacrifice cards from hand to generate resources.

A fun, complex but easy to pick up, resource management/empire building game.

Amusing artwork makes for an accessible game, enhanced by a growing number of expansions.

My first 2 player game took 2 hours to complete.  While there is certainly strategy you can employ, you can't really plan very far ahead because you don't know what cards you will get.  And for the most part, you have to use all your resources before the end of the round.  So it takes quite a bit of thinking to maximize use of your resources.  Also, it seems like there a few faction cards that are way over powered.  My opponent was able to play his powerful cards at the beginning of the game.  But I did not draw my powerful card until the last round.  So this caused it to be unbalanced.  If this game only took 45 minutes to play, I'd give it a thumbs up.  But considering it takes 2 hours (and I doubt it will be much quicker on a subsequent play - especially if more players are added), there are many more longer games that I prefer.

While this isn't a bad game, I don't ever get the feeling that I'm making choices in the game.

Here's why this game is a solid "fine."  First, I'm not upset about the "take that" in the form of razing, which is (i) really infrequent, (ii) often a bad idea from your own perspective, and (iii) when it is a good idea, everyone recognizes that yeah, that point producing building needs to go.  That didn't bother either of us.

What does bother me is the "I go you go" turn structure for a game with minimal interaction.  The only reason to interrupt my turns is to give you an opportunity to raze my buildings, but it's pretty rare.  Otherwise, my turns are simply putting pieces of a combo together, but bizarrely our turns have to be interwoven for some reason???

With a game like Nations it makes sense, because one action is drafting from a common display.  Imperial Settlers doesn't have that (the closest would be drawing from the shared deck, but that's all face-down).

The second flaw are the combos themselves.  Despite the variety of cards, they're really basic: make stuff, turn stuff into more stuff, turn that stuff into points.  It's pretty pedestrian, and its simplicity is hindered by the aforementioned turn structure.  I have to do all of these simple actions, but interrupted by your own simple actions.

A game like this can't compete with Race for the Galaxy and Seasons as tableau building combo games.  Cute art, yeah, but vanilla gameplay.

Played with 4 players and it took 4 hours. The beginning of the game feels like you are handcuffed and can't do many of the actions. It takes too long to build up but once it does, then there's allot of fun choices to make, then the game ends. Text is super small on the cards. Also there's some over powered civilizations in the game. I'd play it again, maybe with less players but this is not a purchase for me.

Great way to get my 51st state fix when complexity/time would be an issue. I like engine builders and games that push you towards a different approach, keeping the game fresh. Imperial settlers does both well.

RATING: 7.5
PROS:
- the resource tokens are very cute;
- the graphics is very cute;
- you can make all sorts of combos;


CONS:
- feels like a solitaire game;
- the text on the cards is very small;
- to discard and produce new resources every round is annoying;

I am very attracted to this game and I'm looking forward to going through all the solo options. I will eventually buy every dang thing for it that they offer. I'll try it on Jake someday, but WAY too many choices per turn for AP prone Dave.

Imperial Settlers is a tableau-building game in which you play cards that represent buildings/institutions that help you gather resources and expand your civilization. The four factors have their own unique buildings that when combined with a huge stack of common buildings, give the players a lot of choices and make their civilization grow differently each time.

The cartoon-ish characters and structures depicted on the cards are adorable, but the text is rather small. Unless you have memorized the cards, you won't know the functions of each card at a glance. That poses a problem for non-veteran players, which are probably most people. There are also many nuances to the card functions, so it leads to confusion and necessitates frequent visits to the manual and online forums. These are just minor downsides to an otherwise solid game. 

Also, the solo variant is fun and serves as a nice bonus.

Played 1x. Didn't like it as much as 51st State but it could definitely grow on me. The factions are so different that I'm not sure I was playing right. Seems like there could be a lot of strategies to explore. However, the deeper strategies are not as obvious as in 51st State, so I can see that if groupthink becomes too powerful, this game can grow stale as people use the same strategies over and over again.

1-4 players, card drafting/tableau building, medium heavy game, 75-90 minutes.

Rating based on a couple of plays, both solo and with 2 players. I like the mechanics and flow of the game and the art work is really appealing, very colourful with nice wooden bits. Traded the game away, but decided to add it to the collection once again as I'd like to play this some more, try the different nations and perhaps some of the expansions.

Happy with this one, although wish it was less aggressive.  Probably less a problem in the multiplayer version, but in two player attacking feels more mean-spirited than I'd like.  

All that said, there is a lot to like here.  A lot of variety in cards and strategies.  I look forward to playing this one for a while.

I was excited for this when it came out, bought it at Gen Con and even had it taught to me and my son personally by Ignacy, who we happened to run into at Steak n Shake. We played a lot at first but I couldn't shake the feeling that the luck of the draw was overwhelming. Some buildings are simply a lot better than others, and if you get those early in the game while another player gets crap, no amount of good play will help. Every game I've played of this I felt at least one person in the game was favored by card draws. Tried it again with expansions, but still got the same feeling. I suppose deck building might help, but I no longer have the desire to find out. If it were shorter, you could play multiple games to even things out, but it's too long to have this much imbalance.

Each player receives a deck of own faction cards, and by drawing cards from this deck mixed with cards from the common deck they try and build an empire consisting of production cards, benefit cards and action cards. The faction cards (Roman, Egyptian, Barbarian en Japanese) are very different. Depending on which faction you play, you will play a different game.
The game lasts 5 rounds, each consisting of a card draw phase, a production phase, an action phase and a clean up phase. The action phase lasts as long as at least one player hasn't passed. Since each faction can only stock specific resources (people, gold, food, stone, wood, weapons) one has to try and spend all non-storables produced each round.
The draw of the cards is important. The order in which you receive certain cards influences your scoring ability. So you have to trust your luck. Sometimes powerful combos appear, sometimes you're just struggling to get some points on the board. This can be frustrating, but it is also what makes the game highly replayable. Even with the same faction you can end up playing a very different game depending on which cards you obtain early on in the game.
Conclusion: an enjoyable civilization builder card game.

Initially you are limited in doing much in your first couple of turns but the game ramps up really quickly and you start to produce lots of resources and are able to build a lot. There is some restriction but you can trade workers 2:1 to get another resource.

Despite the ability to raze your opponents and play location actions off of others, there is very little interaction in the games I've played. Despite being a 5 round game, the later rounds can go longer since players will have more resources to spend.

Primarily a hand management game.

Euro per 1-4 jugadors, ASSIMÈTRIC!!! i amb una barreja curiosa de mecàniques. 
A bote-pronto, i amb una sola partida, m'ha semblat una barreja entre el Caos i el Belfort però sense el factor majories/control d'àrees. Cada civilització té les seves característiques i es juga diferent (aventuro dir: Bàrbars = Khorne, Egipcis = Slaanesh, Romans = Nurgle i Japos = Tzeentch, ja veurem en properes partides).
Robes cartes que pots "equipar" permetent-te fer més coses, i donant-te punts de victòria. I amb els recursos estàs constantment amb el "cuento de la lechera" (igual que amb el Belfort).
Joc molt interessant! Però dubto que el ventilem mai en 1 hora. El draft a cada ronda ja pren un temps, i després s'han de quadrar moltes coses.

Fun, quick playing card game. First game a bit strange trying to figure everything out and making mistakes, but second game (Japanese vs Egyptians) was lots of fun. Japanese specialize in making food - or at least I did this game, and the Egyptians have a few powerful cards (one of which I destroyed with the volcano from another expansion). ~60 min 2p game, short-ish setup with pinch cups for bits.

The barbarian needed to keep the Japanese in check - as Egyptians I had no way to do it- but sitting on the other side of the table and with the tiny print on the cards upside down, he understandably decided to just do his own thing. Final score 120 Japanese, 90 Egypt, 60 barbarians. 

Fun to monkey with the cards but the result was a foregone conclusion. 

For multi-use cards and production chains Oh My Goods! does the same thing quicker, cheaper, better and in a smaller package.

Edit: rating of 5 is based on my single play, but reading negative comments, all the big, consistent  criticisms were already showing their ugly heads. Rating will almost certainly go down with closer acquaintance, which I hope to avoid.

a Rich civilization building game. It is a card drafting games with three main elements. You have cards for income which is one of my favorite mechanisms. Then you have ongoing abilities on other cards. And then finally you have cards that can be activated as an actions. There are common cards and then your personal faction cards. Simple clean elegant design and fun to play. It does remind me of Nations but later. An absolute must buy in my opinion

Boy do I love this game.  I've played it twice as a multiplayer and probably 4-5 times Solo.  Decision making is hard and more than once I have regretted a poor decision.  Each turn is just a bit longer which really adds to the feel of your city growing throughout the game.

I like the elements in theory but they don't seem to come together for me. The direct conflict in particular seems clumsy. It's not the focus of the game but you're still all but required to do it occasionally to win. I'd prefer a purer civ-themed engine builder.

I also have a bias against games where I have to keep rereading the text on my opponents' cards a la Magic.

Good engine building game with a light civ theme. There are better engine builders however. Game is quite parsimonious in giving you resources, it's like running your car on fumes for miles, some people may like that. It makes the game quite unforgiving of mistakes and you will know you are losing, which again is a good and a bad thing. Game is very well supported by expansions, but there is lots of material straight out of the box. Though I do think the main thing going for this game - it is good - is perhaps the cutesy artwork which hides a relatively brutal game - hey that's my fish like - as you can burn peoples stuff down if you fancy. The resources are also quite cute - though I do wish that every resource had been wood, rather than a few things which are cardboard chits. However there are better turn x into y and get z games out there - though these are mostly worker placement game -  and hence this one doesn't get played as much as it should. Jury is still out.

Offloaded this one with no remorse.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid civ-building card game which feels a little like a blend of Race For The Galaxy and Ora & Labora, although a little simpler than both.   The fact that resources clear each turn (apart from storage abilities) makes getting your cards played a bit of a puzzle.   The faction decks offer a lot of variability, and the game comes with a large number of cards.   Graphics and production are excellent, although the text is a bit small.   Plays very quickly after a learning game.   The ability to sack other players buildings will be loved/hated by some, but it provides most of the interaction (which is still fairly low).   Overall, perhaps not terribly original, but really well-executed and a joy to play.

(a note on the solo game:  the victory condition to qualify for points is far too easy, almost to the point of irrelevancy, so it just becomes a quest for high score.  Playable, but not really a challenge, per se.)

Wanted to love it, but just doesn't feel worth it after each play.

Love the theme and the production values/art is adorable... probably the best game I've played in this regard!  Plays well with 1-4 players and does engage you with constant decisions.

While it has many things going for it, I do not enjoy this game.  One of the biggest annoyances when playing games is having to read text on cards/tableaus that are in front of others around the table rather than seeing symbols or pieces that describe what you need to know.  Of course multiple plays would help alleviate but games have to grab me in the first 1-4 plays or its gonezo.

Also, the outcome in my opinion was based more on luck of the draw and politicking properly as opposed to clever tactical/strategic decisions.  Of course this could even out with plays, but the first 4 games of it... blek. 

Many other games that scratch a similar itch that reward intelligent short and long term decisions.

I usually like to play a new game twice before coming to a decision about it, but I was only two rounds into my second game (after not enjoying the first) when I concluded that I was done. We abandoned our (two-player) game rather than playing through to the end, which is something I pretty much never do. This just isn't a type of thinking that I enjoy at all: I have zero interest in performing precise calculations about a bunch of discrete cards. It's like the min-maxing at the end of a game of Agricola, except that here it's the whole game. Most resources can't be kept from round to round, which means that you have to figure out how exactly to spend everything you have in every single round, and it's extremely unpleasant. I will not be touching this one again.

It definitely feels like a streamlined version of 51st State.  While I don't think removing some of the convoluted aspects of its predecessor was a bad thing, I dislike the changes they made to player interaction.  51st State, surprisingly, encourages economic player interactions, where players can use an opponent's building, trading a worker for another resource.  In Imperial Settlers, you destroy your opponents' buildings and then get stuff.  Having such a directly antagonistic option in an economic game seems out-of-place to me, and I never used it.

while the gameplay isn't broken there are some serious game balance issues with the draw of the cards. It appears that a player can be taken out of the game with good/bad draws and there doesn't appear to much that can be done to mitigate this. While that alone doesn't make it a horrible game, the miserably small font on the card makes it impossible to play, as you have to know not only what your cards do, but what your opponents cards do too. So you are faced with the choice of either constantly leaning over your opponents cards or just ignoring them. likely will never play again in the current format. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic game with charming artwork and good quality components. Very addictive. The few issues I have with this are some internal balancing issues. I know it is meant to be an asymmetric game, but I can't help but feel some of the factions are very weak or too strong compared to others. I have yet to play a game where the barbarians did not win when someone played as them, nor have I experienced a game where the romans won. Maybe neither I nor my opponents have grasped the roman strategy yet? I also wish that the box insert was designed better to hold the different faction cards (maybe a bit like the dominion box).

Less civ builder, more card tableau management. While players each have a separate faction deck, gameplay really revolves around managing a balance of faction and common cards. The factions seem to stress a particular  strategy, but the common cards allow for some flexibility. The game seems OK, it just didn't grab me. Cute art though!

Thought 51st Stat/New Era had a ton of potential, but I just didn't like it compared to other tableau builders I've played, so I moved on. Imperial Settlers was announced. It was said to have streamlined play, text instead of iconography (I like RFTG's iconography, but 51st's was horrid), even better graphic design/artwork (imo), and unique factions! I was really excited. While it is much better than it's predecessors (again imo), I've tried it many times, but it's still not as good as some other tableau games I own. 

My biggest problem with the game is that faction deck sequence can really make-or-break your game. With faction cards, you really want your production buildings and/or card drawing in the beginning. Sadly, I've played games as the Barbarians where the 3 copies of the cards that produce 2 wood were all within the last 5 cards of the deck and that just majorly puts a hamper on things. Card draw is also really important to try and mitigate the faction deck sequence issues, but that in and of itself is a sequence issue with the common deck. If my opponent gets all of the Watchtowers and Castles (??), there is not much I can do about that. Yes, I could Raze those buildings, but that doesn't work if they just raze it from their hand. Finally, the game lasts just a little longer than I'd like it to and it usually seems like a winner can be determined by the 4th round, making the last usually inconsequential. It wouldn't matter if rounds were of equal length, but the turns naturally get longer as you build up your engine. 

This may sound really negative, but I do really like many aspects of the game. I even contemplate re-acquisition from time-to-time, but I think I've made the right decision by passing on it.

This game is currently #90, which is about a 1000 ranks too high. The game falls in the same category with Seasons: a multi-player solitaire extreme.

Every player does their own thing and you have no way - or even a reason - to keep up with what others are doing. This would be ok, except for the "razing", which means attacking others (or your own cards). Razing is super annoying both ways: when you're attacking you don't really know or care what to attack (in terms of hurting the other player best way you can), and when somebody suddenly attacks you and destroys your plans. Razing should be taken out of the game or made a bigger and better part of it.

Discarding all your resources at the end of the round is stupid and picking them all back again at the start of a round...

The game is boring and without any real decisions.

The Japanese faction totally ruins this game. Without the Japanese playing, I would give it a 7 or 8. With the Japanese, it just sucks. I will absolutely never play with the Japanese (not me playing them, if anyone would be playing them, I'm not of fan of awfully designed games), they aren't necessarily busted, its just ruins the game that their upper level building are the only ones that can be attacked. Just poorly designed. I've played several times with 3 players and no Japanese. All the games have been very enjoyable. This game is probably going to become decent if you add expansion races to it. I do hate games that are unplayable as printed though.

This games fun. But light and it seems like luck of the draw plays a lot into the power of the cards. The drafting doesn't really address the issue, as its easy to get a good card 4th, or a nearly unusable card 2nd or 3rd. Certainly the cards are not anywhere near balanced. It plays in about an hour, if people know the rules. The rules are pretty easy to learn and quick to teach, so huge plus there. The rules on some of the cards are confusing, and the rule books not a huge help there.

Initial Rating was a 10 after many play through edited it to 8 for a couple of reasons.

Some race, especially Egypt/Japan seem too OP in my opinion.

Slow game if your hand and drawn cards couldn't set up any combo you will be sitting there for a long time while opponent could spent many action performing the combo.

Plus side the art work is gorgeous.

The thrust of the game is hand management and efficient resource conversion that leads to a) a points engine on your end and b) the ability to throw monkey wrenches into that of your opponent(s). You do this by using cards to get resources to build cards that will give you more resources to build VP engine and attack cards. 

OK, I’m a gamer, I get it, it’s up to me to chain my cards as efficiently as possible in the evolutionary chain of “production to effects to VPs.” That can be fun. But I don’t find inspiration in this implementation. The arc of the game is set for every play; you’re going to be heads down in isolation for the first act and then look up for the last act with the Beatdown Finale. 

This last act requires you to now track your opponent's numerous powers as well as yours and is simply tedious and complicated by the unnecessarily small text. It would be marginally better if each player had the choice of building to lose himself (or ask your opponent to tell you which building they should raze and save us all time).

The whole thing feels clumsy and under-developed. The Igo-Ugo card drafting mechanism in particular feels like a gawky attempt at subtlety, as if that's supposed to add some sort of consideration to things; it doesn't. All the races do is provide the veneer of difference but it's all the same puzzle. The effect for me is a mildly interesting solitaire efficiency puzzle that I spend several turns working out and then some bitchslapping as we race to the end.

Note: I only played 2P and I can't imagine how chaotic it would be with more. I've heard complaints about card draws affecting the outcome which doesn't surprise me; just more clumsiness of the design from the Dan Brown of the hobby.

3-3.5 rounds of building/mitigating randomness and then 1-1.5 rounds of actually accomplishing something does not a solid game make.  There's some high points and good design, but we're just not a fan of the game being so back loaded on the game play we like.

RATING: 9
When this released at GenCon at 2014 I thought "that looks neat, and I like Race for the Galaxy, but I'm not sure it's worth the money..." it is, every penny.

The asynchronous play between the factions fells well integrated, as well as the color matching/set collection aspect of the game (want apples?  Collect reds.  want workers?  Go for pinks, and so on).

I'm a big fan of tableau/engine building games, and this is no exception.  The direct attack cards bring interaction to the game that would otherwise be missing.  Also, since you collect a wood for being attacked, and most likely needed a foundation later, it doesn't always feel like a bad thing to lose your building.

If you're looking for a new card game with lots of depth, then you should look into Imperial Settlers.

Számolgatós, odafigyelős, de egyáltalán nem nehéz. Csak azon kell agyalni, hogy milyen lapvariációval tudjuk kinyerni a legtöbb pontot, azaz a jó kombó megtalálása a lényeg. Kezdőknek azért okozhat némi problémát. Sok kártyával a kézben kifolyhat az ember szeme, szétéghet az agya, hogy megtalálja az optimális lépést! :-) De pont ez a szép benne! Egy kis vigasz, hogy jól elmagyarázható a játékmenet szinte bárkinek, aki játszott már modern társasjátékkal. Vonakodtam beszerezni, mert elrettentett a hossza, legalábbis amiket olvastam róla. pedig egyáltalán nem vészes: ketten 70 perc alatt letudtuk a partit. Sőt!

So far this fixes all of the things that kept me from getting 51st state to the table -- long turns, huge downtime, unnecessarily complex draft.  The direct attacks aren't game-breakingly powerful, and exist as a way to dismantle somebody else's engine if they're running away with the game.

5. [b]Inability to destroy faction buildings:[/b] Why can't you destroy a faction building? Why? Why? Why? Is there a single reason for not allowing the players to do that?

I always liked 51st State a lot, except that it takes hours to finish and is quite fiddly. But the basic mechanisms and the drive of the game appealed to me, and I generally do not like engine builders.

So playing IS was very easy for me, it's largely identical to 51st, just a touch clearer and limited to 5 rounds. A few of the anomalies in 51st are removed, and it's all smoothed out and easier to play.

Two criticisms, SUCH BLOODY SMALL WRITING ON THE CARDS!!!! Drives me crazy, the text is so bloody teeny tiny, who can reads this stuff??? And secondly, it's much more multi-player solitaire than 51st, the only inter-action is destroying an opponents building or stealing resources. At least 51st had the element of spending my people in your faction, which helps you too. So it's another engine building solitaire, but retains enough of the fluidity of 51st, it's worth playing.

[b]Card-driven empire-development-lite game. Every round is one long, growing combo. Leans euro. Despite apparent asymmetry of decks, games tend to feel similar from play to play. [i]Let a friend own it.[/i][/b]

Rating history: 8|9|8|8|8|6|8...

1p - 1 play - Decent, but not too challenging.
2p - 5 plays - This is the way to play it. No downtime.
4p - 1 play - Way. Too. Much. Downtime.

10+ plays (MAR/16) - This game is pleasant to solo, and I've made peace with the fact that the decks feel similar from play to play (i.e. you see most of your deck in a game, so it's just a matter of what order you play things in).

1st play: 8. OCT/14. I enjoy Robinson Crusoe, so another game by the same designer was a must-try for me. The artwork is a style I love (chubby toddlers on the Sumo card!), slightly reminiscent of Klemens Franz mixed with NES 8-bit RPG style. 

The game is essentially a pay-to-put-in-play card game, but of course there are a few wrinkles. First, the resources you need to put cards into play are very hard to come by. Second, some cards won't be played; they can be "razed" for a quick one-time boost of resources/points. Third, some cards won't be played or razed, they'll be used to make a "deal" - which allows you an extra (precious!) resource! Fourth, while all players have access to a common pool of cards, each player has their own civilization deck that give each player a number of different ways to approach the game.

The powers the cards give you are more euro-style than american: effects tend to be minor, similar, limited to one use per round (max five per game!), and revolve around exchanges of of goods/points/gold. This is not Magic, nor even Agricola. I'm not a huge euro fan, but this simple abilities allow players to construct a lot of inter-locking half-engines to produce points, etc.

I like this game. How much I like it remains to be seen. My 4p game took 3 hours, but if I can get a 2p game under an hour, I'll like this game. I may even love it once an expansion comes out.

5th play: 8. Oct/14. This could drop to a 7 in another 10 plays. Factions are not quite as asymmetrical as I originally thought, and I can see losing enthusiasm for the game after a half dozen plays of each deck. Needs expansions with more complex abilities and a new mechanic.

[b]6 plays in[/b] and my enthusiasm is waning. Every play of the game feel too similar.

Well... I thought that nothing new could shine under the sun, boy, how mistaken I was!
Imperial Settlers is a truly truly gem. The different uses you can do of a card put its replayability to the top! You can build cards from your hand, you can make "deals" with cards from your hand, you can raze cards from your hand and from other players tableaus. The way you play this game may vary strongly depending on the people you're playing with, but, also, depending on the specific faction you and your opponents are playing with (the base game comes with four different civs/factions).

I'm not tired at all... I mean, I really like this a lot!

Hármasban próbáltuk ki a játékot. Mindenkinek volt már 51st state tapasztalata így a megtanulása elég könnyen ment. Alig van különbség működésében az elődhöz képest. Láthatóan cél volt, hogy egyértelműbbek legyenek a szabályok. Ez sikerült is, bár nem volt nehéz túlszárnyalni a 51st state szabálykatyvaszát.

Az alkatrészek minősége vegyes érzelmeket keltett bennem: a nyersanyagok nagyon cuki fa alkatrészek, különösen az alma tetszett. Viszont a kártyák minősége nem túl jó. A kártyagyárban jobb kártyák készülnek. A lapok vékonykák, a nyomtatás messze nem tűéles, enyhén elmosott. Még a népek boardjának nyomtatási minősége is véleményes. A tokenek rendben vannak.

A játék most már fix 5 körből áll. Ugyanúgy lehet dealnek, expolitnak, vagy épületnek letenni egy lapot. Leginkább talán az exploit szabályai változtak: itt már rögtön megkapod a cuccot, nem kell várni a következő kör elejéig, nomeg elvileg exploitolhatod a másik játékosok felépített épületeit is. (ez lehet, hogy volt már a new eraban is, majd valaki tapasztaltabb megmondja a frankót). Azért írom, hogy elvileg, mert ez kétszer annyiba kerül, mint a saját lap exploitja, így mi az első játékban nem igazán láttuk értelmét.

Ami még érdekes volt, hogy a saját fajod lapjainak nagyon kis százalékát húzod fel a játékban, így az, hogy éppen milyen lapok kerültek a kezedbe, nagyban befolyásolja a játékodat. Ez egyfelől nagy újrajátszhatóságot jelent, másrészt, egy-egy rosszabb kéz eléggé nehézzé teheti a játékodat szerintem. Nem tudom mit lehet kezdeni azzal a szituációval pl., ha valakinek nem jut ponttermelő lap. Persze ezeket nehéz egy játék után megmondani, úgyhogy inkább csak érzések, semmint valós kritikák.

Összességében azt mondom, hogy ha már megvan és sikerült is megtanulnod a 51st state sorozat valamelyikét, akkor nincs sok értelme megvenned ezt a játékot, mivel inkább csak egy egyértelműsített változata az eredetinek. Ha viszont még nem ismered 51st state-et, de szeretnél egy elég komolyan kombózós, egyedi kártyajátékot, akkor mindenképp ezt válaszd az elődök helyett.

u.i.:
A négy faj elég más játékot igényel, így valódi variable player powers játéknak tűnik. Más a teljes paklid, más nyersanyagokat tudsz átmenekíteni a körök között, és másokat is termelsz a körök elején. A kiegyensúlyozottságukról nem mernék egy játék után komolyan nyilatkozni. Nekünk elsőre a japánok erősnek tűntek az olcsó, de ugyanúgy két pontot adó épületeikkel

---------
A második játékra más sokkal jobban tetszett. Bármikor jöhet még: ->8

Thought this game would be in the same genre as Settlers.  What a mistake!  It's far superior and hugely benefits by not allowing one player to destroy another player's work too much.

Imperial Settlers is a tableau building game that technically works but is seriously lacking some inspiration. For the most part, you are trying to build a typical resource conversion engine which is a very solitary endeavour - and then for some reason the single available opportunity for interaction is negative, allowing you to disrupt other players' plans by razing their buildings.

In general, having different factions with somewhat different starting powers, strengths and weaknesses seems like a good idea to add some variety. For the factions included in the game, however, the asymmetry seems to be so strong that you either follow the route your faction dictates or go under, ie. you're actually not in a position to choose which path you would like to take. With the strategy already chosen for you, it pretty much comes down to drawing the cards in the correct order (production buildings first, VP buildings later). In contrast to, for example, Race for the Galaxy there simply isn't enough card churn to overcome unhelpful draws.

Excelente juego de cartas sobre construir imperios y de gestión de recursos. Aunque tenga poca interacción entre jugadores, como una especia de "solitario", no aburre ni ocurre análisis-parálisis; todo el mundo está haciendo algo, pensando en lograr la mejor combinación de recursos para hacer ciertas acciones para ganar PVs, qué cartas saquear al rival, usar distintas estrategias para cada civilización, etc.

Lo recomiendo para quienes desean un juego con muchos detalles y rejugabilidad, pero simple en sus mecánicas.

Vier Comic-Völkerfiguren mit kiddy Knollennasen treffen sich in einem fiktiv herbeigezerrten Land und balgen sich um die Vorherrschaft in Form von Siegpunkten. Dabei ist auch das Zusammentreffen historisch wackelig: Ägypter gegen Japaner?!?!! Hä?? Auch IMPERIAL SETTLERS klingt mühsam gebogen und hätte genauso gut EMPIRE FOLKS oder NATIONAL MONUMENTS heissen können. Doch Textkrampf und Völker-Mix werden von einem patienceartigen, autistischen Kartenspiel aus Polen wettgemacht: aus einem Stapel individueller Völkerkarten und einem allgemeinem Stapel legt man Ortskarten dreier Grundtypen in gewohnter Kombi-King-Manier in die eigene Auslage, um einen Motor zum Laufen zu bringen. Dabei hat jedes Volk seine Stärken und Schwächen. Das Schöne und Angenehme bei IS ist, dass es mehr taktischer als strategischer Natur ist, was dazu führt, dass sich die Züchtung von Grüblern am Tisch in Grenzen hält. Der solitäre Multiplayer zum überteuerten Verkaufspreis schreit förmlich "Erweiterung" in Form von neuen Völkern und weiteren Karten. Allerdings gibt es auch inhomogene Elemente: die Downtime kann ziemlich krass und das Zerstören von eigenen Karten durch den Gegner verheerend sein, von daher funktioniert IS am besten zu zweit. In diesem Sinne darf die Knollennase auf dem Cover darf mit ihrem Wau-Wau weiter in den Krieg ziehen.

It's a combo generating light civ building card game with unique factions. one thing I really appreciated about it was that the cards, once played, were nicely organized so that it was far more straightforward to locate and remember to perform acquired abilities as the game moved forward.

Imperial Settlers is pretty nice! At the end of the day it feels simply like a resource management game, but there are little things going on here and there to make it feel quite pleasant.  I like the card play and was quite surprised how few card you go through and are able to build before the game ends, but it's a nice thing to have a shorter game that does card drafting and engine building.  I really like the art and the ease of play and that the factions are different and that there is a lot to explore. I wish it did something to make me feel like it wasn't just another resource management Euro, but at the end of the day it is just that.  However, it has Trzewiczek's signature design style that I enjoy and I think this one is a keeper.

I really like this game a lot. I was quite surprised at the solo variant which I play the most. It seems simple in a way, because you really just maximize your cards synergies by carefully picking them and paying attention to what they do (and it can get slightly boring after a few plays). It's still an enjoyable synergistic card manipulation puzzle that is quite fun to me. Every game is "slightly" different due to shuffled decks, and you can play 4 different factions which are "slightly" different. The first game was a bit baffling, but by the second game I had learned some tricks to keep the Virtual Player from knocking out so many of my cards, and also learned the power of using Feature cards to gain more Victory Points.

Card drafting, hand-management, each player has a different deck and goods generator. Cards have multiple uses. There is attacking in the regular game but sometimes it's helpful but may not be spouse friendly but there is a non-violent variant but I would think that is a different game.

After one solitaire play, I'm somewhat underwhelmed.  Maybe I need to play it more to get the nuances, but I didn't seem to have that many options.  I had a cornucopia of unused workers at the end of most rounds.  I have a feeling the multiplayer game is quite different in feel.

Scores:

Solo - Barbarian 32

I've played it 5 times multiplayer now, and I really liked the 3-player game.  The different faction strategies really come out, and our game was very, very close all the way through.  

Tried it with 4 players, and it does bog down a bit.

RATING: 3
I wanted to like this game, but I couldn't get into it even after several plays with other people who enjoyed it a lot. I don't like:

0) essentially zero player interaction aside from the bizarre raze mechanic
1) how similar all the factions are to each other
2) how rushed I feel to get stuff done in only five rounds
3) the combat is ridiculously shallow and should just be taken out, or expanded
4) confusing and overly long rules text (wait, how do I raze my buildings versus other players'?)
5) lots of "I gotta remember that this building generates this resource each turn"
6) way too much text to read on the cards, which slows down the pace

The whole game just feels "off" somehow. I love 4X type games when they're computer games, so I figured I would like this game, but it's in serious need of polishing the rules and gameplay flow. Maybe a revamped 2.0 version in a couple years could convince me to try it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very enjoyable, if somewhat peaceful simplistic card-empire building, with limited interaction. I find the euro-styled art work quite catchy and reminiscent of French/Belgian comic book style publications, so for me, it's aesthetically pleasing. Not sure if I prefer this to 51st State yet, since the themes are so different, even though they are siblings, mechanics-wise.

Very good resource collection/VP conversion engine building game. The rules are clear and all the bits are very good. The art is cartoony but fits the game well.

BUT:
The iconography and text are very small - impossible to see from even next to the player - leading to -
The game is very high on the multi-player-solitaire scale. There is a "raze" action that allows players to eliminate another player's "non-faction" card to get resources but this is trivial interaction and gives the owning player a resource anyway so basically you play these non-faction cards expecting them to be razed.

Only played solo so far and I find limited appeal in solo games where you are just trying to max your score like this one. I can see the potential for multiplayer being good though, so I will likely reevaluate my rating once I have had a chance to get it out with the gaming group
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Fills like a multiplayer solitaire game.
After the small (and not always so important) draft and at the start of every round, there is very little interaction.

The scoring is mostly based on the luck of draw of the faction and common cards. Your round is usually just try to build more production/feature/deals cards that generate more resources for you that round, so you can keep building more...

In 3-4P it is probably even more boring, waiting for your turn, forgetting your plan... Especially when you can barely read what others build, or even do something about it (except raze, about once/round, that barely change anything; and the very broken buildings that destroy faction buildings)

THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A CARD GAME!

Demo'ed this game this sunday at a con, I was the only one there that knew how this game worked.

The game was set up before I got there. Someone did that based on the image in the rulebook, not knowing that this is a game were you start with next to nothing, but end up with tons of cards on the table.  So my table was really too small and players had to build over and into each other.

Second, I guess because of the cute art, the organisers (who didn't know the rules nor the game) were placing "newbies" at the table.  By which I mean people who played Settlers of Catan once or twice.  For those that are calling this a "simple" game, I disagree completely.

To be clear: The fault of the above lies not with the organisation (they really did a great job), but because this game was brought in the last minute by the sponsor. Everyone (organisation and many visitors) expected it to be a not-heavy game because it says "card game" on the box, it has cute art, and you start with an empty board.


Great game though, but it's not because the rules are streamlined, this game is for beginning players.  This truly is a gamer's game.

It's a quick engine builder with a lot of interaction. I like the tension that razing brings to the game which keeps some very good cards in check. It transforms the game from a traditional euro with only resource conversion optimization to a more modern design with negotiation and tough choices with risk. I was worried that I wouldn't like the fixed turn limit, but that simply adds to the tension of when to start to shift focus from building a machine to cashing in points.

The luck of the draw can be a problem and some factions feel more fun than others, but  perhaps that will change with experience.

RATING: 5
This is a bit of an unfair 5-rating in that it's a personal 5, or a 5 for me, but I see how Imperial Settlers is a good game and why others would rate it much higher. I've just come to realize that deck builders/hand builders/tableau builders where turns take longer and longer so each player can "run" their area don't appeal to me too much. This might work better as a 2-player only game.

PROS
-Theme and art are fun!

CONS
-Card abilities are not that exciting; most are just point generators.
-Gathering resources to build three or more cards in a round felt like too much of a struggle. It reminded me of City of Remnants where I just spent 2/3 of the game scraping enough together to do one small action.
-Despite the "razing" mechanic, player interaction is pretty minimal. 
-Quite hard to keep track of what others were building or working toward in a 4-player game.

My biggest complaint is the tiny font, which was difficult enough to read on my own cards, but completely impossible to see on my opponents. I stopped trying because it was giving me a headache.

Excellent card management/engine building game from Ignacy Trzewiczek.
The replayability his great!  Each Factions plays differently!  With the expansions, you can build the Factions deck to suit your play slyle.
The solo mode is great to try your deck when building it even tough some of the cards work better in a muliplayer game.
You will need to play multiple games with the same Faction to tweak your deck to have a good combination of Production and Actions to spend the maximum of ressources and reach new high score.
The only complain I have about this game is that, with 3 player it takes more than 2 hour.  I can't imagine playing it with 4.  I'm used to play in less than an hour when I play solo.

This game has a special place in my heart because of Zinger from the The Chalk Boardgame Reviews.  During The Final episode of his podcast, he invited my girlfriend to play with me (unfortunately its not on iTunes anymore).  He contacted Ignacy Trzewiczek who also invited her to play!  She finally accept to play with me and she loved it and will play again!
Thank you Ignacy!

What a great game! It's a friendly looking empire/tableau building game with ruthless player interaction. In a way reminds me of Race for the Galaxy but it's so much easier to learn, and the factions give it a dash of personality.

Part of its ease of play is due to its graphic design, which makes everything very clear. The player boards are a great way to keep things organized and the building placement makes it easy to read.

As soon as you open the box you can see the amount of care that was put in every little detail. The components are great, the art is wonderful and there's even a video tutorial you can learn from!

RATING: 7
Quick and easy to play, and quite addictive. However, for all the cute artwork, it's not very thematic; it just feels like drafting cards. It's also pretty much one-player solo (I think; we haven't gone into razing opponents' buildings yet, but it doesn't strike me as a massive part of the game).

Still, it's an excellent game, gorgeously presented.

This delivered almost none of what it promised; the asymmetry wasn't interesting, the tableaus didn't feel like civilizations, it wasn't particularly quick or light, and it still had plenty of "you can't do that" rules. (But Ignacy's blog post talking about wanting to avoid the "everything is forbidden" dynamic, where experienced players are constantly slapping new players wrists over rules mistakes, was fascinating and I agree with its points. I just don't understand how an attempt to avoid it led to this game.)

I like a lot of games that get called "multiplayer solitaire" and yet I was bored senseless during other people's turns of this game. Worst of all, it pulled back the curtain and made me hate all other resource-exchanging 90-minute Euro games for a while.

Redeeming factor: I won by like a million points.

So far some better changes from the new era, some worse.  Rulebook not that great.  Need better reminder text on game such as getting a wood when building is razed and use a food to make a deal.  Not sure if factions are balanced.  need to play more.  Not really feeling the theme.  Don't really feel like you are doing meaningful stuff.  Includes why cant we be friends expansion.

A very good, strategic card game. The last rounds can be AP heavy, and it can be hard to catch up if someone gets a good engine going, but I think it's a great game. I look forward to the expansions.

A slightly improvement over 51 State, not quite as interesting as 51 State Master set, but very solid.
Just don't think it is for everyone as the nice portuguese? man in the box wants you to think. The game can be brutal.
As 51 State, it works well with all players counts.

Ładna grafika. Pomysł mechaniki skopiowany z 51 Stan.
Niestety gra w ogóle nie jest zbalansowana.
Nacje są bardzo nierówne i jeżeli dodamy do tego losowość z kart to wyjdzie na to, że gracz grający najsłabszą nacją będzie chłopcem do bicia.

We enjoyed this game.  We played the non-combat version where you can only raze your own cards.   It is quite a fun empire-building game with a lot of potential.  I'm not sure all races are balanced in the non-combat version, though.  Good game, overall.

Didn't do much for me. The asymmetry is nice, I guess, but the drafting and interaction is hampered by some of the samey-ness of the cards and the really tiny font. Normally I don't complain about font sizes, but how am I supposed to be able to look across the table to discern what my opponents can do and want when the cards are so difficult to read?
Smooth enough mechanically, but didn't grab me.

After some more plays, this game lost my interest. The first play was nice and fun with a lot of things to puzzle with. However, after that first play, I noticed how straight the game actually is. There isn't much to it, while luck is a big factor in this game. The lack of real interaction makes it even less interesting. Destroying one or another building doesn't change the game, it just slows it down.

Thought it would be cool, but it couldn't hold up.

RATING: 8
Beautiful art and design, fun mechanics. One major annoyance is the small symbols and text, it's almost impossible to see what the opponent's cards can do. I have to stand up and walk around the table to determine who must be attacked and who is (really) leading.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this game. Pretty simple mechanics, but many choices to be made which is neat, but can lead to some longer turns when there are too many calculations going on as far as resource usage. 

It's neat that the factions play differently from one another, though players may not know what each other have built unless they are constantly looking over at the others' play area. But players can simply announce what they are building and what the building does, so everyone can have at least some idea of potential actions/benefits the others will have at their disposal. 

Lots of cool cards to play, from both the faction and common decks. Though sometimes there can be some card luck where a player can get cards early that will have long-term benefits, while other times get cards near the end of the game that aren't useful at that point. But then you can decide to raze your crappy cards for the resources or make deals with some etc. 

I've played 4 games with others and 12 solo.

RATING: 10
Propably my favourite game since it's the one I've played far more than any other. The rules are simple enough to explain to casual gamers and everyone I've played this with has liked it. The only other game that I've seen getting that reaction is the gateway classic Ticket To Ride. Also, the artwork is really cute. For me the visuality of a game means a lot and Imperial Settlers hits the spot perfectly.

So basically every player chooses a faction of their own and draw cards from 2 piles: common and faction decks. These cards can be used in 3 ways. They can be built as buildings, destroyed for goods or turned into "deals" ie. turned into production facilities. Players have goods, workers and raze tokens they can do the forementioned with or activate the card abilities or destroy a building from another player.

Buildings come in 3 varieties: production buildings, feature buildings (ie. "every time you do x you get x") and action buildings (ie. "use a worker to get points or goods").

That's it. All cards have their own abilities and costs and players are weighing on which cards to pick, build and destroy. It's surprisingly addictive and ego-boosting to come up with chain reactions giving you buildings, goods and points.

The game also includes a solo game where you are trying to build more faction buildings than the "virtual player" has cards in his deck. Between rounds he attacks taking the cards he hits. The solo game works very well. It's quick and fun meaning you'll be doing it a lot. I love my Mage Knight but it takes a day to complete one game. Imperial Settlers' solo game takes 20 minutes.

There's some comments complaining how "uneven" the faction cards are. I can't agree with this. I've played with all of the factions and I've never lost playing against my friends. They all have a different flow, especially the Japanese which are more of a defending faction. Whether you win or not has more to do with how you are using your cards. Having said that, luck is playing a role. There have been times when someone is getting a row of bad cards and never really getting a chance to play.

All in all a great came! Only the expansions I can not whole-heartedly recommend. Why can't we be friends and 3 is the magic number offer more cards without messing with the gameplay but the 2 new factions (Atlanteans & Aztec) I'd pass.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Don't believe the hype. The game is pretty and has nice euro mechanisms, but each race has an overpowered (and worse, easy to build) building that you may - or may not -  randomly draw during the game. If you don't draw yours, you won't win - simple. A very poor design oversight in a very promising game. Also, later turns can really balloon and drag on in endless combos of cube pushing, which adds even more frustrations for those who know they've already lost (and before you ask no, it wasn't me - I was a close second!).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
excelent game. But as with all cards games, the player who knows the cards get a little ahead planning the strategy when compare to new players. But that is the only bad side that i can see. Also the expansion is awesome. Not only add another faction, but other cards from the basic factions and other mechanic, the "technology"

Easy to start, flows like oil, difference of factions is a huge plus but hit you in the head in the beginning, so there is learning curve. To optimise starting with this hould get everybody to play 2 player with romans and barbs once before a 4 player. Could one play with two sets 2rome and 2 barb? So there is a similarity with neuroshima right there.

This is such a fun little game.  You need to keep an eye on your neighbour and give him a few elbows from time to time (its limited to what you can actually do to opponents).

The most powerful buildings completly chrushes this game! They are way to cheap to build, and if you get one early in the game, for example the Roman card Engineers, their is nothing the other players can do to stop you from removing the other players more useful cards from the game (and in the case of that card, getting VPs for doing it :-/). Basically you are TOTALLY dependant on the luck of the draw in this game.

The game takes atleast one hour to long to play for what it is (both times I playes this, it took almost 3 hours!)

I would say that this game is roughly as deep as something like Takenoko, beacause a couple of lucky draws really changes the odds in your favor. In a short game like Takenoko it´s OK, but here it really is crappy.

I really like the idea of having asymmetrical factions, but it is hard to pull of designwise, and in my opinion they have not succeeded here.

And the Japanese faction seems to me to be heavily underpowered! If you play a strong building, the other players are gonna knock it down for you ASAP, beacuse Japanese faction cards are razeable. Then one might think that the Japanese faction should be compensated in some way for this, but I am yet to find the advantage they have (I have compared the different factions cards to the Japanese, and still no advantage found, quite the contrary!)

All in all I am really disappointed at this game! It feels rough and unpolished, unfinished even..

Much better than the designer previous game The New Era. The rules are clear and streamlined. You don't have to memorize the symbols which is a huge advantage. I feel like the previous theme was more captivating but i also like ancient history. It is a typical game that needs repeated play you need to memorize the cards to find an optimal strategy. Like in The New Era you have plenty of options to choose from which makes paralysis analyzis a higher threat. If you have played The New Era before it is easier to get into this one.

Pros / Cons:
-The rules are clear and streamlined, you don't have to memorize the symbols.
-The playtime finally around one hour. 
-A lof of options to choose from your strategy.

-You can atack your opponents but it is still a multiplayer solitaire. You will use your hardly earned weapons to build better buildings instead of atacking each other.

I really liked my first play though it ran a little longer than I would have liked.  Certain factions may be stronger than others but a lot depends on what cards get drawn.  I like the "use it or lose it" mechanic of resources though each faction can store at least one thing.  Some of the attack powers are annoying.  Losing your common locations to razing isn't that bad because at least you get a wood but some locations give abilities like removing someone's deal/income cards which can be painful.  Looking forward to playing this more.

Decent and attractive game. However, to do really well you need to just draw all your cards, at which point it just becomes a case of working out the best order to play your cards. It's fun at the start but the final turn can take forever and there can be a huge amount of downtime for players that didn't managed to amass their cards.

Very good. The variety in ways you can play cards and the different ways they interact provide for lots of different strategies.

I worry slightly that each nation would usually end up being played in the same (or similar) way because of the personal decks and attributes - I do wish they'd made the boards double sided. I also think this pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable amounts of in game text...

Finally don't play it with newbies and Mark in the same room - he'll rush people then complain when they make mistakes

A confusingly titled empire building game (nothing to do with the Catan series) that provides yet another entry in the list of Civ-games-you-can-play-in-an-hour. It doesn't quite come off for me as the luck factor is considerable, you need production buildings early, vp buildings late, if you don't draw them there's not much you can do but go through the motions. Dominion is a much better system as everything is available to buy, you just need to be able to afford it. Here you're building an engine by drawing parts at random, it might work, might not.

This is almost a pure card combo game.  Five rounds seems like it would be too short, but in fact it is just enough time to build up a nice engine and execute it a few times.  Having both a personal deck and a common deck available is a really clever idea.  Quite enjoyable; I'm looking forward to expansions. (1 play)

One of my most played games. I always want to play this. Really like the mechanics, theme, artwork. It's a very elegant design, I just hope the expansions won't make it too fiddly!

One of the only games I enjoy playing solo!

My major complaint about the game is that you can't put all cards from the expansions together and expect to have a balanced game. You have to deckbuild for that, otherwise it's difficult to come up with a viable long-term strategy as you have no idea what cards you'll draw.

Owned expansions : Why Can't We Be Friends, Exploration Tiles, Atlanteans, 3 is a Magic Number, Aztecs.

Un juego descendiente del 51st State pero reestilizado y estructurado de nuevo para hacerlo más jugable.

En síntesis es un juego de civilizaciones que se juega sólo con cartas. Contiene cuatro culturas (bárbaros, romanos, egipcios, japoneses) con sus ventajas y puntos débiles. Los jugadores deben construir estructuras que otorgan beneficios mientras intenta desarrollar un motor económico para conseguir PV´s suficientes que les permitan alcanzar la victoria.

Su grafismo me recuerda a los juegos de estrategia en tiempo real de hace unos cuantos años y en lo que destaca es en los combos de las cartas específicas de cada civilización. El conflicto directo es esencial para jugar bien aunque no es lo suficientemente duro como para dejar fuera del juego a nadie.

Lo que más me gusta es la idea de usar una carta de muchas maneras. Puedes construirla, firmar un pacto o saquearla y todo ello te permitirá obtener beneficios

After a few playthroughs, this multi-use card game is about engine building and indirect player edging. Though there are multiple different races, the initial strategy isn't as hard-coded as some would lead you to believe; the outcomes are largely a result of inter-player choices leading to a high level of replayability.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

Imperial Settlers is 51st State refined. I don't know how else to describe it unless it's to say it's been refined a little too much so. It's ironed out all the bugs and iconography of the original masterpiece, but has lost a lot of the original games complexity in the process. It's tricky to critique the game as overall I still prefer the original, but the combination of artwork, speed of play and the ability to quickly teach it to anyone has definitely pushed it ahead. 
However, it has quickly become a solo regular and I might burn out on the inherent simple-minded strategies of each race quickly. So unless a greater variety of strategies show themselves with add-on packs, or if they don't release at least one new race a year, it could quickly drop below 51st, especially since they have just announced the revamped Master Set.

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Very cute artwork and fantastic resource components
- Ease and speed of play 
- The ability to teach a civ-building game to anyone

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Strategies become very repetitive after 20ish plays, even with the "Why Can't We Be Friends?" expansion
- Desperately needs more variety.

A solid fun card building game. Always trying to get the most points with the cards you get. Sometimes the cards you draw aren't the ones you need or want, and you have to make the best of it.
Plays great with 2 or solo, more players make it a bit to long for my taste, but you have a lot of options for interaction.

Nothing absolutely spectacular at first, but it was all around a very pleasant experience playing it the first time and it kept getting nicer as you slowly got the game more and more. Whether that is because it does not have enough depth and is something nice but shallow or because it really is that good a game I don't know.

RATING: 8.5
Similar level (and mechanics) as in 51st State/New Era/Winter series, but the feeling is different.

IS is simplified.  It offers less choices and rules subtleties plus somewhat easier decisions.  The variability is smaller.  And when it presents itself it's not always from the bright side (like some folks gettig their most powerful faction buildings right from the beginning while others - late or not at all).  Randomness is introduced/increased by – paradoxally - fixed faction decks.  They were supposed to provide some stability/predictability, but at the same time they fuel the randomness: the order of drawing particular cards is very important for the final score...  Still, an experienced player can overcome it (to a substantial degree) with a good play so it's not so big deal. 

The game is a sheer optimization fun and that's why I recommend it.

I love it. I haven't tried the campaign play yet as I still enjoy trying to top my score with each faction. Quick, tight solo game. Can be dependent on card draw but easily a "one more game" type of session and it is incredibly satisfying to hit that chain of perfect draws.

Current high score: 94 (Egyptians)

RATING: 6
Suffers from a bit of randomness in the cards. Twice I've played against a barbarians player who has gotten four instances of the "1 point per raze" card who then proceeded to just collect swords and common cards and absolutely demolished the rest of us in points. Four points for a card and a sword as many times in a turn as you can afford is absurd. But when you get your deck doing what it's supposed to be doing it's a ton of fun. But even if you do get all the right cards fast enough, there are enough ways for opponents to blow up your stuff that it never feels safe. Sort of a weird hybrid of a resource management euro with a few brutal take that cards thrown in.

Update: I've reduced the rating by half a point since every time someone has suggested this over the last few months I've vetoed it. I think I just always end up getting frustrated by the card draw.

One of my least favourite things in games is when I need to know what abilities that other players have that can affect me or that will affect my strategy, but that information is not possible to see at a glance without very good game knowledge or by getting up, walking around the table, and physically reading everything that is in front of the other players.

In this game each faction has a few cards that can mess with other players, you need to know immediately when these cards are on the table. You also need to know what resource/points engine cards that the other players have in play for when you need to interrupt those engines. Finally(?) you also need to know what razable cards the other players have, their raze bonus and how powerful the card is.

The game plays great and has lots of nice mechanics as a card driven civ builder, but it takes a long time to play with 4 players (well over 3hrs), it's not so bad in that each players turn is fairly quick, so the downtime between turns isn't a problem, but the number of turns players can take in the latter rounds is where the ridiculous game length comes in.

Most of the luck of the card draw can be mitigated by having a lot of card draw and/or using lots of workers to draw cards, but unfortunately without the ability to search your deck for the important early game engine cards, you can be at a big dissadvantage if they are all at the bottom of the deck.

As for how cuthroat the game is, other than razing ability, each faction has:
Barbarians: steal resources, destroy deals
Egyptians: block locations, temporarily steal locations (can do a combination of these two 6 times per round for an additional 1gold each time if 2 swimming pool's are out)
Romans: steal deals, destroy locations
Japanese: destroy deals, destroy locations

Most of these attacking actions are cost effective so there is no reason not to do it every round, the problem is that whoever gets the destroy location ability card out first will have the upper hand (except the egyptians who steal/block and therefore will rely on turn order), especially if it takes several rounds before the other players draw their attacking cards.

This game takes too long as it is, so I won't be playing 4player again, even 3 is at the limit, in reality it's probably one of the best solo games around. But in multiplayer, I can't see this game being a long term keeper given the vicousness of the attacking cards (they feel imbalanced, overpowered, and like they are artificially adding interaction to a game that does need the interaction, but they don't do a very good job), but I shall have to play this a few more times with everyone knowing what they're doing before deciding for sure.

51st state with historic/fantasy races.

There is a lot more player conflict in this one compared to 51st state especially as the game plays over a set number of rounds as opposed to first past the point threshold. Expect buildings to be razed or straight up removed from game relatively often.

The game does have a pretty fast pace as well as acquiring resources is a bit easier but that may depend on your race.

With just one new or slow player, the micro-turns involved in this game can be quite a drag.  The rounds get progressively longer as time goes on, as each player gets a bigger and bigger engine cranking.  Attacking other players serves minimal effect, so there's very little interaction despite being able to destroy buildings.  It gives them a resource and a building site anyway!

I'm giving this an 8/10, which is my overall score. My more nuanced score for the game is:

Solo 9/10
2 Players ?/10
3 Players 7/10
4 Players - don't want to try it 'cause the 3 player game takes too long for what the game is, in my opinion. 

The game is well-designed and maintains interest and tension at 3 players, but after having played the solo rules, I can't help but feel constrained and impatient while playing multiplayer. The solo game is extremely entertaining and engaging. The only reason it's a 9, not a 10, is because some of the cards become useless and I've played Friday, which is designed for solo play (no wasted cards), and scratches a similar itch...albeit with less variety than Imperial Settlers offers.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2014)

At last I got to play Imperial Settlers. I didn’t have high expectations because I read the game was similar to 51st State, an ok game for me. To be perfectly honest I didn’t find the games much alike BUT I played 51st State a long time ago, now I want to try it again.

The art, components and overall presentation of the game are gorgeous, (Spoiler Alert) love the hidden ninjas in the box :D. Easy to teach. The playtime is relatively short and the game flows very quickly with little downtime. I think it is best with 2 players, but I would play with any number of players although with more than 2 players there can be “an attack the leader” effect that I have come to dislike. Also with 4 players I feel a bit of downtime.

The theme does nothing for me.

Imperial Settlers is a very good combo card game, it has some luck of the draw but I think it can be mitigated in many ways (production, deals, attacks) so for now I´m very happy with it. I love card games that have interesting decisions, and this one does because most cards can have multiple purposes, you can build, raze and make deals. Without spending cards you also have interesting decisions, you can attack or you can use your population as a joker. Love the drafting phases.

At first blush, it seems some of the decks are stronger than others (Egyptians and Barbarians), but I really don’t have enough plays to see if this is true. 

As it is a card game, it is easily expandable and I would love to have more factions in the game.

Bottom line, a good game I want to explore further. It´s like a simpler version of RFTG. I will buy it in the near future.

The only downside of this game is...its title!

The art is very cute :) which I like a lot. 

The civilization building aspect is very strong in this game. I loved how quickly your empires grow in size and I was so proud to look at my tableau at the end and say to myself, "I built this :D" 

As much as I loved Nations, the sense of achievement in this game is greater I should say. The strategy is not so light either, although it is not heavy enough to deter anybody away too. I was able to muster up average score (50+) in my first solo game. And I think that this game I can teach very easily to almost anybody and they will pick it up right away only if they are playing as Barbarians/Romans as rule book tells you too.

I am hoping to see more awesome factions and cards! This is very enjoyable game.

Nice game.  The factions appear to be relatively balanced and fun.  My only complaint is a few of the cards that allow for large unexpected point swings.  I enjoy games that allow you to beat up the leader, but if someone can play a card near the end of the game for 10 points (when final score is 70) then all the work during the game to keep players in check is wasted.

This game takes a few plays to really dial in how each faction works and how to counter the others.  My gaming group is large enough that accomplishing this would take far too many plays.

Overall, good design, but not for me or my group.

the game takes a little to learn but is simple enough once you get your head around it. The joy of this game is all the combos that you create. The game is only 5 rounds and the first one goes passed quite quickly, but the escalates quickly and before you know it you have a huge empire in front of you.  The cards all have multiple uses and the combinations can get long and creative. With four different fractions to choose from (five with an expansion) the game is diverse and feels different every time. I love that you don't get through all the cards and even after several plays we are finding new cards.

Each turn you draft cards, gather resources, play cards to your tableau using those resources and then using cards to draft more cards, get more resources, or to convert resources and card builds into points. 

Very pure engine building game. Very pure. I didn't find that this game offered any more than many other games that come in much smaller packages. The 5 rounds even feels a little short to develop your engine in a meaningful or greatly interesting way. Not a terrible game, just not worth the space it takes up in the WAY over-sized box.

I suppose what makes this game a little different is the faction cards which are unique to each faction. So you do need to fashion your strategy a bit to your faction, but you are still very limited by the cards you are able to draft.

This would work better as a two player game, and I would likely rate it quite a bit higher in that context, perhaps a 7.

I am not a fan of the balance through player conflict design. It leads to the dreaded meta-game discussion of who is winning and the unavoidable king-making. 

The factions do not seem to have much depth. They each seem to rely on a few key cards and combos, making the early card draws hugely important. Drawing into your factions main point engine early is a huge advantage. The solution is to beat this player down with negative player interaction, which I don't enjoy.

[b]My thoughts on Imperial Settlers[/b]
Imperial Settlers is a medium weight civ building game with an emphasis on card tableau building and resource management. You can either play the Romans, the Egyptians, the barbarians, or the Japanese. Each faction has a unique play style and its own deck of cards. There is also a common card deck that is accessible for every player. The cards can be used for multiple purposes: to build as buildings, to trash (raze) for 1-2 resources, or to use as a deal (thus providing you with a certain resource at the start of each turn). The game lasts for 5 rounds
I pre-ordered Imperial Settlers and picked up a copy at Essen 2014. Although the theme isn't very original, I really like the look and feel of this game. The artwork is incredibly cool and reminds me of some real time strategy PC games. There is a nice level of direct player interaction, as you can raze each others' buildings. The decisions regarding your cardplay can be very interesting. You are trying to figure out certain card combinations that will provide you with an resource engine that should eventually start producing a lot of victory points. Once you have a viable engine going, the game can get a bit repetitive, though. Also, I don't like that turns get longer and longer with each round, and its seems that some games of Imperial Settlers might overstay its welcome because of that. Other than that, a solid game.

On our initial play, we made the mistake of playing this like other euro-ish civ builders; keeping to ourselves and only occasionally poking the other players. This is not how the game is meant to be played.

What a difference some conflict makes. When played as intended, interfering with other cultures to slow their progress, it is a phenomenally engaging game. Player turns are quick as you are only allowed one action, and as a result the game clips along at a great pace. Depending on what your opponent(s) have built, the security of your buildings may be fleeting - so you need to be careful about how you plan your turns. It's very easy to have a big scoring turn shut down by the machinations of clever opponents.

Each culture plays a little bit differently, and lends a fair amount of replayability; certain to be enhanced by expansions. A runaway leader issue is certainly *possible*, but if everyone is keeping each other in check properly, it's unlikely to happen. 

Addressing the 'luck of the cards' complaint; looking through the culture deck after a game, a common phrase around our table has been 'if only I'd had that at the beginning of the game!' It's *possible* for someone to draw their deck in an 'ideal order' so as to have a perfect start, that develops into an unbeatable lead. But the chances of something like that happening are so slim as to be nonexistent. Furthermore, it ignores the influence of other players on their development.

Long story short, if you're not playing this while f**king with other players... You're playing it wrong. Conflict is one of the main ingredients that helps make this game great.

After three games I must correct my initial impression regarding razing. When playing the Barbarians, it's an essential part of the strategy. Especially the Japanese can suffer big time from this. Having played all factions except for the Romans, I had the most fun with the Barbarians. The Japanese can be fine when there's no too aggressive player around. The Egyptians seem a bit boring. Getting more cards early is key for any faction.
---
Mostly a multiplayer solitaire tableau building game. The only interactive action of razing opponents’ buildings was rarely used in our game. As the cards cycle slowly through the hand, it’s more a tactical puzzle to make the best out of your hand as opposed to a strategic tableau builder like RFTG. 
I like it but I’m a bit afraid that the order of the cards in each civilization’s own stack is too decisive if players are reasonably competent in solving their puzzle. In a game, probably less than half of a stack will be played through and when a few key cards needed to create synergies don’t show up there’s nothing to be done.

In our plays, the Romans have steamrolled the competition. I really have an issue with the most valuable (faction) cards being invincible. That makes it very luck based as the right faction cards at the right time can win the game.

I enjoyed this one for the first two or three games, however, in the end there was just too much math, and planning, especially in the final rounds. I just didn't enjoy straining my brain so much to figure out the best order to take my actions so that I could get get the most buildings out on the last round. I ended up selling it.

This feels like a card management / worker placement combo mixed with Smash Ups artwork and direct interaction style. Is a little bit too long, especially when played with newcomers (play one round less unless you are familiar with your faction). Expansions add other factions and deck-/theme-building aspects which makes replayability a big point of this game.

I really disliked this game as soon as we started playing. The rules felt too complex for a game with so much take that. The swinginess of the special powers also bothered me. I realize that this is probably the big draw for most people. But to me the theme means nothing.

The one saving grace of the game are the illustrations. I really appreciate the evocative art style. I also have to commend the publisher for using such a small font. I don't know if it's 6 or 7 point, but it is very small. this makes everything look better since the text is more sparse. Usability takes a hit, but I have to admire the emphasis placed on graphic design.

A very Good game with the big drawback that it can be very swingy. You could perform super or you can't get the right cards. I've seen plays where the winner was clear in round 2. If your in last place and still have to play for an hour, that's not funny.
I would suggest to play just the base game because that gives the greatest chance of a balanced game (imho). When the game runs balanced it is a solid 8 for me, but the unbalanced plays by luck of the draw really degrade this game for me.

Fantastic deck/tableau management game.

Feels like it finishes a bit quick, as you'll only just get your economy up and running and be able to do a heap of neat stuff right before the game ends (of course, this possibly just means that I'm horrible at it).

However, the designer needs to be praised for creating something this complex while almost entirely eradicating dead turns: you've always got the option to cash-in on alternative resources to pursue your strategies. That part, at least, is majestic.

And the doofy art is just great.

If I had known Imperial Settlers was based on 51st State I wouldn’t have played. It was probably better than the original but I thought the pre-built deck was so focused that I was forced into one viable strategy. There was also some unplannable randomness and take that. For me then, it lacked interesting decisions. It also took a long time to play so I consider it an experience game with little strategic or tactical decision-making. Of course I have non-typical tastes so my opinions needn’t spoil your fun.

The game takes some time to get into, but rewards you when you do. Simply excellent. 

Literally the only bad thing I can say is the card text is small, but once you know the cards...this won't matter.

The "issues" reported with this game are grossly overstated, and typically from players who didn't give the game a proper chance. 

The factions are well balanced and the best player wins 9/10 times. Great re-playability. Quick setup & take-down time.

It's odd... the game didn't really impress me on that first play but yet I do find myself constantly pulling it out.

Resource management game where cards have multiple uses (up to 4 or so?). Nice components.

I'm still not entirely sure about this game. It's a great engine builder, and I have enjoyed exploring this. Yet I seem to like it despite it having very limited player interaction. I tend to like games where it is clear that you're playing against other people. That's not really the case here. When players raze my buildings I simply shrug and treat it as some random event, rather than part of a larger strategy on their part. 

As a solo game this is terrific, but as an interactive multiplayer experience I'm still not sure what to think since it goes against so many things I appreciate in games.

2014-12-06 - After two games I can say that I like this game, but I'm not sure if it will get better or worse with more plays.

Anyway I will play again, I played only with Romans so far.

RATING: 7.5
Good engine building card game. The interaction is kind of paradoxal, is very restricted to the raze aspect and it can be very powerful (so it is a low interaction with high consequences when interaction occurs). Also, the luck on the draw can be very annoying and swingy. The art is kind of deceiving, because the game is too mechanical. Despite the problems, it is an enjoyable game to play and I'm curious to play and see the other factions.

RATING: 10
This is probably one of my favorite games that I don't get to win in much if any.  The game is chuck full of choices on each of your turns, and every choice just feels good.  You can use a card in a couple of ways.  So a hand of just four cards can net you roughly eight options.  You can build, make a deal, or raze common cards.  This is on top of the things you can do with your resources like meeples.

The game can play fast with the right group, but those that like to AP will grind this game to a halt.  That's the one gripe I have with it, but it's not the game's fault.

This game is very similar to 51st State, but the choice between the two for most is the asymmetry to the factions.  I'm for the asymmetry purely for the fact that you feel unique when playing the game.

The capability for direct player interaction adds to this game, and takes it a step up from an engine builder.  The game also balances it out by giving the attacked player resources when picked on as well.  You gain a foundation for other buildings, and a wood for losing your building.  This is great for even peaceful players to get acquainted in this game.

The components are great, the illustrations are in a a very cartoony style, and everything fits well.  There are those that had said the text is small, and that might bother some, but I have no issues with the text, and the symbolism is great so it makes it easy to recognize what does what.

Bottom line, this game has high replay due to the fact that you probably won't go through your entire deck, and commons are so varied game to game you won't be locked in to a certain strategy in back to back games.  Each time you draft cards, one is discarded, so you'll almost always have 1/4 (3 players) of your cards going to discard without ever seeing play just form that alone.

With high replayability, high production value, good expansion support, fast setup, low down time, there is little I can say about this game to deter someone who is curious.  The only thing I would say is, if you hate asymmetrical games, you might want to go with 51st State.  If you ARE about asymmetrical games though, it does not get much better than this.

I played this twice with my wife, Barbarians vs. Romans. Here is the primary issue I have: You start with two faction cards and draw one per round. This means that you may only get 7 of your 30 faction specific cards per game. Even if you trade resources to draw cards (which would mean that you would not have enough resources to build them) or happen to draw a common card that produces cards as a resource, you will likely only draw 12 of your faction specific cards. That means that more than half of you deck goes unused. I find this somewhat frustrating.

I am looking forward to playing this more and seeing if this is a deliberate design decision so that each of your plays requires you to adapt your strategy. I will update.

4/8/16 Played this several times solo and I really enjoy it. Looking forward to a campaign. 

Update 5/25/2016: I primarily play this solo and love it. Bumped from a 6 to a 7. 

4/1/2017: Adding the Atlanteans and Aztecs really ups this game for me. Loving it more and more. Moved from 7 to 8.

However to make sensible decisions you'd need to understand not only our own engine but your opponent's too, which with the tiny card texts is quite an effort from across the table. Also you are just flat out screwed if you don't happen to draw cards that allow you to actually score points.

Good thinker of a card game that takes Civ and throws an interesting card game on it.

Very well designed although it lacks a bit in the interactions between players - can't decide whether it wants to be multiplayer solitaire or have people at their throats (maybe it's letting them decide for themselves...)

03-12-2015 - First game was stellar.  Amazing variety and the perfect complexity and length for a quick evening game.  The second play revealed smaller variety than I initially thought, the actions the cards grant are all pretty similar (more or less) and a little ho-hum at times, but it's still quick and fun and I'm hopeful the future expansions will bring more variety.  In full disclosure I haven't used the Egyptians or Japanese yet which offer play differences.  Not at all giving up on this one, 8 for now.

Good game. However, I actually played 51st state before playing Imperial Settlers and I think that 51st State is the smoother and sleeker implementation of the two. The one thing I did like about Imp. Set. is that the faction actually dictated a little bit more of the gameplay and added some extra flavor, but at the cost of a bit of complication that may or may not pay off after multiple plays. If you only buy one, buy 51st State!

I like the basic idea of the game but the end game turns into a weird resource exchanging activity. Also, a bit too agressive game for me (need to destroy other people's buildings). Text and symbols on cards could be bigger.

Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.

I hadn’t played 51st State or New Era before I played this one, so I can’t provide comparison, but it could be felt that the game was long in development. Well, it’s a hyped Euro mostly played with cards; one about converting resources and cards a lot, but actually I found it was better than I expected. Nations had different abilities but those did not put them on one strategic path. Well, the cards you drew did have quite an influence on your winning chances but somehow it did not bother me here. I would not say no to playing it again when offered.

Engine building tableau game. Feels somewhat snowbally, especially with the very limited Razing mechanic (which seems prominent only in barbarian/egypt matchups). I've only played two 2-player games so far, would be curious about 3+ player games. Very attractive, colorful art.

Traded away after three plays. Couldn't shake the feeling that the game was missing something. The tension never built up, each turn feeling plodding and somewhat predictable. There are some OP cards with 'take that' mechanics that don't feel great to play with.

Was a 9 for me, until they released 51st State Master set. Degraded to an 8 because of the text on the cards. Don't get me wrong. The game is stellar and the building feel is like no other, but all the different cards can create situations where it is not easy to know what happens first. Aka the frustrating part about Magic.
Will never turn down a play of this, but will often suggest 51st State over this.

In the end, fairly classic engine building card game with solid but unoriginal mechanics.  Faction asymmetry is half the fun but opens the game up to balance issues.  Very nice art.  The take-that aspect turns games with more than 2 players into a mess of bash the perceived leader / randomly bash for profit.

RATING: N/A
Playable solo. After a video review: Has some similarities with 51st state but at least the whole rules are on the cards as text not just a list of icons.

Basically, each player has a civilization and place building cards that gives various resources and abilities. Don't like much the card drafting but it's not the core of the game and alternate solutions are available.

I just don't know how the solitaire version is different. It could still be an interesting game as I don't have much tableau building card game in my collection.

The solitaire version seems easier, it's basically a random razing building with a few twist. Stil the game could be good. I might have to read more or play this first. My only concern is when you have many special powers and abilities, it can become easy to forget.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
On further reflection, I still enjoy this game either as a 2-3 player game but one has to be prepared to deal with the luck of the draw in this game. Too frequently, I fear the game does come down to whomever draws the best cards (although proper utilization is also key). Some factions feel much stronger than others (Japanese & Atlanteans feel quite strong while I don't much care for Barbarians). The card art and theme just works for me in this one that I don't get overly frustrated if the card draw is not favoring me...at least too much. I do wish there was some way to draw a certain number of faction cards and draft a couple to start instead of just drawing two. Might try to house rule that and see how it goes. 

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Really enjoy this wonky, asynchronous card game with four distinct playing styles and decks.  Cards can have multiple uses between abilities, being razed for resources, being used as a negotiated production, etc.  I generally enjoy card games where cards can be used in multiple ways and this didn't disappoint.  There is also resource generation used to construct these buildings.

Interesting hand management game in which you find yourself taking actions to convert resources into new resources to produce more resources etc.  Lots of opportunities to develop efficient engines of various sorts and I imagine the four factions each provide their own flavors in this regard.

I really enjoy this every time it hits the table. There is some player interaction with the razing, but mostly, you just figure out how to maximize what you can do on your turn with all the resources you have at hand. It's not straightforward, and your strategy will vary depending on what is available and which direction you're heading in. I love this puzzly aspect of the game and very much look forward to playing it again!

RATING: 7
The first turn of my first game we had no idea what cards to draft, but that's ok since we quickly got the hang of it and I like how it is still much simpler in the early rounds since you have less buildings in play, which helps you ease you into the game.

There is some interaction outside the card drafting and razing, however by mid game it was hard to keep track of what everyone else could do at least in a 3 player game as there were too many cards on the table, making it difficult to know what everyone is capable of and which cards are key to their engine. However it is still possible to play this game almost as multiplayer solitaire in some situations.

The iconography is pretty intuitive, and the basic rules are pretty simple, it's mainly dealing with what card should I play and it what order that the decisions become difficult.

The factions feel pretty different, gaining different resources more readily and having some unique powers within their cards. However, there are still too many cards that feel like I'm just shuffling resources around to eventually be converted to points.

I feel like setting up a good draw engine is important, as relying on the luck of the draw to get the best cards for your engine is inefficient since you can only draw one card from your faction deck per turn, and there is no drafting mechanic for it. In fact, this game has a very strong engine building feel in general despite only lasting 5 rounds.

I've seen a lot of people saying they weren't a fan of razing, but honestly since you need to destroy your own buildings to play most of your faction buildings anyways getting razed isn't that bad, and in a game with more than 2 players can actually benefit you since you gain a wood for getting razed, while not all other players benefit.

3 players seems to work pretty well. I've only played 1 2 player game so far, but it didn't seem to have that much of a better experience.

The Japanese appear to be the hardest faction to play since their faction buildings can be razed, and they need to use samurai to protect them. As recommended in the rule book the Romans and especially the Barbarians (due to their ability to get a ton of resources) appear to be the easiest to play

I feel like this game sometimes has a runaway leader problem unless it is a 3+ player game with the runaway leader playing Japan. A person who designs a good engine can draw a lot of cards, and thus has a higher chance to get their victory point generating cards. Therefore, getting good cards to be able to produce the resources you need in the beginning is crucial. While the card drafting of the shared deck helps alleviate this a bit, there is still some reliance of the luck of the draw early game.

I am not a fan of the solo variant, as at least with my play style the dummy player doesn't seem to change up the game that much, making it feel like I am just off on my own building my own VP engine, abstracting the game to pushing wooden pieces around, instead of a tense me versus the game. Maybe if I play again with the Japanese this will change, but then the whole Samurai mechanic of the Japanese is mostly nullified.

EDIT: Depending on play style this game can devolve to multi-player solitaire. 2 players is definitely shorter than with 3, but besides preventing unwanted ganging up I don't really like it anymore with 3 (despite the BGG consensus). 
Even with the Japanese and the campaign mode I don't really like the solo variant. It definitely scratches an engine building itch, but it doesn't feel like I am playing against anything, more like I am just doing my own little thing, with some random event off to the side that sometimes messes with my engine (and yes I know you can mitigate by not leaving many common buildings at the end of each round). Some of the campaign provinces add significant variation to the game, but as your empire burgeons their effects make the game fiddly.

EDIT 2: So after I got rid of the game, I realized I hadn't  noticed that you get resources immediately when you build production buildings and make deals too, which is a pretty similar rule to miss, although having now played it with the correct rules, I don't know if I like it more, and the general feel of the game is the same either way. While probably more balanced (not as bad if you get production buildings later, making deals which previously seemed very last resort and some buildings that seem almost never worth it seem stronger now), you get an engine building feel sooner, and less harsh on new players, it makes the game quite a bit longer and doesn't reward long term planning as much. I think ideally I would like the game to be rebalanced around my previous incorrect rules. At least the real rules was satisfying in the fact that you can draw my entire faction deck, and it explains why I was getting such low solo scores?

I love this quirky little game with its quirky art, pink meeples, and bright red apples.  Why apples? It doesn't matter.  I love them.  I appreciate that this game can contain as little or as much conflict as whoever is playing desires. Either way, it's a good game (although the conflict makes it a bit better). 

Also, I was surprised to learn that the solo variant is quite good.  The different factions and large decks of cards keep the re-playability very high in my book.

Maybe I went into it with too big expectations, but it was a let down. The art is fantastic and fits the theme very well, but the gameplay didn't do it for me. First of all, it's a card game, so it's quite random. I enjoy quick games with lots of randomness, but not long ones. I would argue this was a LOT more random than Race of the Galaxy (which has many ways to mitigate randomness through exploration) and it played in 4-5x the time. Drawing cards with great synergy at the wrong time, or victory point cards in the early turns was very annoying.

The gameplay itself started from very simple (almost too simple) in the first turn, to insanely complicated in the last turn with all sorts of cards triggering in a tableau that hardly fits the table.

Worst of all, this was a heads-down experience. I never cared what my opponents were doing, except glancing at their buildings to see what I could/should raze. And that was the main player interaction: Razing each other buildings. I get why it's there, but it's not any fun (either doing it or receiving it). I'd rather have a game that is self-balancing rather than force players to bash the leader.

I love games that are fun and leave me with a sense of accomplishment even when I lose.  Imperial Settlers does just that.  Even when I lose, it is satisfying to view the empire I have created sprawled across the table.  

I also love the asymmetrical nature of the factions.  The rulebook states that there will eventually be a way to customize your faction deck.  Add to this the promise of new civilizations in the future, I can foresee that this gem is going to hit the table frequently and will likely remain one of my favorite games.  

I would highly recommend the drafting variant during the lookout phase (acquire cards phase).  Not only is it more entertaining, it also makes the phase fair for each player.

Some have dissed Imperial Settlers, claiming that it has a runaway leader problem.  Keep in mind that it is a card game, so luck of the draw can be a factor.  The runaway leader can also emerge easier if players are new to the game.  However, the more players know the game and the more they focus on drawing and building as many cards as possible from their faction deck, the less likely a runaway leader will emerge because each deck has the cards necessary to combo into huge points.

My only complaint against Imperial Settlers is that every game has ended with me thinking, “If we could just go one more round I could pull off something truly epic.”  But, this is minor and I suspect it may be an issue caused more by inefficiency of gameplay, and not knowing the faction decks well, than it is an inherent flaw of the game.  

I cannot recommend this game enough.  It is an instant classic and in my opinion should be a Spiel des Jahres nominee.  You owe it to yourself to give it a try!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very likable game after just one play (as the Japanese).
The artwork is cute and the ressource tokens are very nicely done. They rolled a fumble in making those tiny flat scoring markers, but they are easily substituted.
The print on the cards are, however, ridiculously small, which makes it impossible to find out what the other players have without asking all the time. And you need to ask, because the game is player balanced, and you need to trash the leaders best stuff or else he'll run off exponentially. The microtype and its consequences is why I don't start it off at 8.

Next game (as the Romans): This game sucks!

Third game (as the egyptians): Combolicious and I almost won with 87 points.

Conclusion:
The Romans have lost big time in all three games we have played, so until a 5th better balanced faction appears, they are out. 
The game is player balanced, but not enough to compensate for a shitty starting hand - or a very good one. There's a huge difference in getting your Pyramids and Caravans early or late - a difference that in my opinion /will/ make you win or loose if you otherwise play decently.
Also, due to the player balancing, it is very important to keep watch on your opponents playfields, but that's almost impossible, unless you have superhuman eyesight or perfect retention.

However, the game remains a solid 7, because in spite of the drawbacks it can be a lot of fun to make all the cogs & wheels fall into place (as long as you're not playing the Romans, in which case they will fall to the floor instead).

Imperial Settlers is a decent game. However, after one play it felt, to me, to have a lot of "take that" or neighbor screw-age in it. I have a strong aversion for games of this type, hence my lower rating.

Man, this game is a blast. There is so much to like about Imperial Settlers, artwork, theme, factions, card effects, overall smooth gameplay, love for details ... Sometimes it is hard to get your engine running because the card drawing is against you. If you are the happy owner of Imperial Settlers you must buy the expansions, they make a great game even better! So much variety!

+Tableau building
+Hand management
+Engine building w/ a great ramp up effect.  You spend the first few turns building an engine and then start executing it the last round or two. Feels good when all the pieces are in place.
+Combos
+Simple rules, but thinky game play
+Multi use cards

This is an asymmetrical game so you need to play to your faction's strength, if you want to win.  This makes the game highly re-playable, but also introduces a bit of a learning curve.  Add in deck building and you'll be able to enjoy this for many, many plays.

Excellent engine builder. Simple to learn, but every faction plays differently and rewards strategic thinking. Great game for family too, as it can be played friendly with kids.

Updated after around 5 plays: 6

Very little interaction (something bad in my book), and can induce a lot of Analysis Paralysis with to many options for a player in a given turn, and that could get very boring for the other players as there are not much to do in the mean time.

Appart from that, it has a very nice graphic design (if you like cartoonish characters), and it could be a very good game if you play with the right people.

I really felt that this game had a solitairey feel and moreover, the personal deck draws contained some very powerful combinations.  I also felt that the game was very fiddly.

Only real downside I've found so far is the font is small... it's really unnecessarily small on most cards.  And the icons on the faction boards should also be bigger.  I had several complaints about that early on when teaching a group of folks over the age of 40.

Otherwise, it may well be my new favorite game.

After 8 3P plays I find this game to be very solid. I like the system. I do wish we had 6 empires out of the box and larger text and symbols instead of large white space areas on the cards. The art is quite nice. Definitely has some luck (cards, duh!) and how you start does seem to affect how you finish. Also, the Romans in our games nearly always came in last. Not sure if that is newbies or if there is something else there. Will see more plays in the future.

My favorite new game of 2014

Can't wait for the new stuff coming this year, I suspect it will solidify this game as one of my favorite 50 games of all time (out of about 1500 played). Great design, quick playing, easy to teach, like the art, replayable. Anyone reading this who has hasn't tried it should give it a shot, a lot more game than it first appears to be.

We play two player with the peaceful variant, so take that into consideration as you read further. This is a great tableau/engine building card game in the same vein as New Era. I love the theme in Imperial Settlers better, but I feel like New Era might be the better game. IS is less restricted, and more of an open sandbox. Whereas NE had boundaries which led to more agonizing decisions. Still, Imperial Settlers is great fun. My only minor concern is the luck of the draw. With any card game, you should be prepared for this. However, in my plays so far, using the same race, I am getting very different, up and down, final scores. I need to keep playing to validate what's going on here.

Really enjoyed this game when I first played it multiplayer.  A very nice combination of tableau building, card drafting, hand and resource management.  Plus plenty of player interaction and great artwork, with different races having their own themes. 

Traded in a copy thinking that I might get some good solo play out of it - highly regarded.  4 solo plays in and I decided to trade it on.  5 more solo plays just to try out the different factions.

The solo game was very samey, and very random.  Basically if you don't draw a sword producing card early you are likely to lose.  It is possible to build buildings which are less likely to be attacked, but this again requires luck of the draw.  After these solo plays, the theme came across as a bit thin.  Looking at the solo campaign variant, the designer's justificaitn for releasing the campaign mode struck me:  "Everybody calls Imperial Settlers light civ game. It is not a civ game. It has no technology tree. It has no wonders. It has no leaders. Yes, some of this will come later in the expansions, but still – I don’t think about this game as a civ game. It is an engine building card game. Without technology and time progress I don’t think it might be called civ."

I completely agree.  What results is an engine building card game that happens to have cutesy Settlers (computer game) artwork.  The output from the buildings logically make sense, but the theme ends up feeling a bit hollow.  The game feels less like building an empire and more just converting stuff into other stuff into points with a lack of motivation behind doing so.  It just can't compare with the theme / tension / atmosphere of some of the other solo games I've got such as LotR, or the better mechanics and theme of Race for the Galaxy (the tableau builder I'll be holding on to).   Can't see it getting any play so time to trade it on.

Awesome! I played not knowing fully what to expect. Even though the game comes in a big box, with lots of wooden components and plenty of cardboard tokens, it really is a card game. And it's also a resource managing game. And an engine building game. And a tableau building game. It comes with four factions, each with a different faction deck, which contains cards that are used to make big scoring combos. Even though it allows you to play lightly, every faction has their own best strategy and optimized plays that will allow players to score the most points. It is indeed a very strategic game. And it can run quite long as well. This may not be for you if: you don't enjoy heavy resource management; you prefer more thematic games; you don't like long games; you really need to roll dice; you don't like games that heavily favor more experient and skilled players.

Rated a 6. Only played once as a 2 player game with my wife (which it was highly recommended for), but it felt like multiplayer solitaire. What did we miss? We'll give it a few more tries and hope it grows on us.

***update*** bumping this from a 6 to an 8. After more plays, my wife and I are seeing the potential here. This has become our two-player game of choice and every time we play it, our appreciation for it goes up a bit. We haven't even begun to dive into the fully interactive potential of this game. We realize playing a peaceful variant with little screwage is fun, but misses out on the full potential of the game... which is going to be a brutal exchange of "I'm gonna use this awesome card/combo to DESTROY your tableau" moments. It's gonna hurt, but it's going to be fun... or end my marriage ????.

I suspect folks who DO NOT LIKE THEIR STUFF F***ED WITH, will not be able to take the joke of having their opponent go for their jugular every turn. This game is really brutal when fully experienced.

Honestly I had higher expectations.
It is essentially more ressource managing than anything else.
The VP generation seems to be a bit underwhelming (building 2-star buildings and do VP-actions). Besides, there are too few (different) function-cards (the IMHO more interesting part of the game). The various folks are not that different and each folk is more or less determined by their specific powers. So after a handful games it feels a bit repetitive.
But the artwork is great, especially for an old The Settlers 3 fanboi!

RATING: 7
A fun game of cardplay and resource conversion. You can attack others, so there is interaction as well. Gameplay is smooth, short turns, not heavy, even a bit light given the length of play. With four players it certainly overstays its welcome, too much downtime and too light for the length of play. Asymmetrical set-up, each player has his own tribe with an own deck to draw from. There is a common deck as well. Would certainly not mind to play this a few more times, but not worth the hype either. It's also mulitplayer solitair in essence, although the attacks have been added for some forced interaction. But total scores are not easy to oversee, so it is easy to attack the wrong guy. And there is considerable luck in the cards as well.

One of the best games in my collection, dont rate it a 10 because there are not enough "races" to choose from (only 5 with expansions) and it would be nice to have different playstiles to chose (each one plays different, wich is another good thing). A simple civilization game based on cards that can be played in 3 different ways, it has huge depth and great strategy (with so many combos in the way you play the cards). It is biased that I only play it with 2, with more players is way longer and with a lot of downtime. But for 2, outstanding game.

This is a game that I feel like I'm trying really hard to like.  I think there's a lot about it I like, but a few key things that keep it from really clicking with me.  The puzzley nature of which cards to build, how to pay for them, which cards to sacrifice, what order to activate buildings in, etc. is super fun and I'm glad this game works solo because I'm very happy just building and running that puzzle.  With multi-players, the overall pace just feels too slow, although having other players certainly add to some of the card actions.  It seems to work well at 2P, which also keeps the pace reasonable, but I still just find myself wanting the game to be 30% quicker.

This is very enjoyable. Building a little point engine is fun and deciding whether to disrupt an opponent's engine or continue to grow your own is tough in a very good way because there are so many options for each card and resource.

Update: Don't like this any more. The winning player seems always to be determined by luck (i.e. who got luckier in drawing the "good" cards early). This could perhaps be mitigated by deck building but I have no interest in doing that for this game. Also, it might be better with 3 players than 2 but since we play mostly with 2, there's no point in our having this any more.

Update 2: Re-acquired because Atleanteans. And maybe it wasn't that bad. I'm nuts.

Update 3: I was nuts for getting rid of this awesome game. It is an absolute favourite!

Great game.  The only issue we ran into was, it was tough to remember if you had used the one-time-per-turn-only Actions from your locations yet.  There should be a marker or token to show that you've used it already.  

Other than that, a FANTASTIC game that was super fun.  

May 26th: I am adding 1/2 a point to this game's ranking because I taught it to my wife and mother-in-law and they asked to play AGAIN on the SAME DAY, they loved it so much.

Players have their own unique deck of cards, corresponding to the settlers they take: Rome, Japan, Egypt or Barbarians. In this card driven game, players play down cards to get more resources and earn VPs. The interaction comes through swords, and you can raze an opponent's card. There is also a mini draft of cards from a common deck of cards. 

It's an interesting game. The first game, you'll feel like it is solitaire, since the card text is hard to read over the table, so you just have to be aware of what your opponent's cards do. With experience, it should get better. I'd like to try all the decks to see what they do. 

Some cards have varying abilities and sometimes it is not clear how to interpret the card. There might be some downtime with more players.  This game has the potential to be good, and some people really like it, but I'm just in the category of willing to play again.

RATING: 4
Cute artwork and has a good reputation, but has two major flaws:

1. Your strategy is pre-determined by the faction you play, because each faction has a strategy pre-built into its deck. (Yes, with expansions you can build decks in advance, but that's not a genre of game I'm really interested in.)

2. When drawing from the neutral deck, card-drawing powers are massively overpowered versus everything else.

After first play at 2p beginner factions romans and barbarians, it was pretty average. You can get so many actions and cards but if you get them all and try to maximize them all, itll take too long and drag out the game, even at 2p.

It also felt like it overstayed its welcome, I felt like r 5 was a rehash of r 4 mainly, just more of the same and shouldve ended. It was 60-90 min too, even at 2p, which felt overly long.

The amount of text made it hard to keep everything in mind, and table space was uneven, so it annoyed me. The print wasnt as bad as it could be but the small symbols and coloration of point track chips annoyed me.

The combinatorial play was meh, not as interesting or engaging as I thought. Not a bad game but eh, Id take it or leave it.

A civilization card game that plays pretty quickly. Art and components are wonderful and the gameplay runs very smoothly. Drags a bit at higher player counts.  Love the overall combination of drafting, engine building, and resource management. All the factions play a little differently which is nice for replayability.

Marvelous engine-building/resource management game with many choices to make.  I particularly like the fact that you get meaningful compensation when an opponent razes one of your buildings.  I can't tell you how much it has in common with 51st State, though.

Side note of very little consequence:  The presentation of "barbarians" in much of Western culture is just absurd.  We're still looking through the Greco-Roman lens.

RATING: 10
This game just feel so good to play.On the first round, you might take three turns: by round five, you might be taking 10 or more!

Even first-time players will end up building their civilization into a little machine that allows your turns to be more and more productive. Once you understand the way production buildings work, you can't help but strategizing as you figure out which order to play your cards in. 

I cannot wait for the expansions, but this also has a tremendous amount of variety right out of the box with four factions to master and way more cards than you will see in most games (if you push it, you can draw almost your entire faction deck, but if everyone is doing this, you will still probably not see all of the common deck). Of course, the game is inherently hyper-variable since playing well depends on timing and your cards will come up in a different order each time you play. 

The most satisfying engine-building game ever, and it plays two in about an hour. An elegant masterpiece!

I like that all the tribes have a distinct flavor and strategy to win.  There's combos to be made and resources to manage, so it kinda feels like a mini-Nations.

My girlfriend has not been able to beat me in this game yet, but she does like it. 

I'm not too sure on Atlanteans or Aztecs needed, but I might get them anyway at some point.

Update 1: 51st State: Master Set is looking a bit better thematically, and I don't like the mess with incorporating expansions on Imperial Settlers.

Update 2: The expansions mixing issues and the fact that in this game you can be totally screwed up in one turn without possibility of recovering if more than one player targets you, made me get rid of it.  Maybe I'll try 51st State: Master Set as it seems to give players more options to gather resources rather than just the cards you build.

This is one of my favorite games.

It's an empire builder that uses decks unique to each player faction as well as a deck of common cards from which all players will draft.  There is not a whole lot of player interaction, but there is just enough to make it feel like we are not all playing solitaire without allowing people to regularly or devastatingly mess with my little engine.

The cards do a good job of sticking with their theme, both in art and text.  This means that each card looks like and does what the title of the card would indicate.

My only real problem with it is that the card text is tiny, so it is often difficult to keep track of what everyone can do, and can even be easy for some people to forget what is in their own empire!

That said, I have played it more than almost any other game of its length (about 20 mins per player for people who have played before), and still am not tired of it.

Excellent game, but best recommended with 2 players as 2 of the 4 factions seem really unbalanced! The Japaneses are quite hard to play while the Egyptians are overpowered, which is quite an issue with 3-4 players; the most experienced player will have to take the hit and play the Japaneses.

For a civilization building game, Imperial Settlers' Building requirements are easy to understand, its endgame scoring is simple to tally up, and warfare between players is not abstract.

I especially like the player versus player combat as it is handled very equitably. The attacker may reap a benefit, but the victim isn't left entirely empty-handed.

I have complaints about the selection of civilizations to choose from. Romans and Egyptians I get; they are historical civilizations from a similar era. The Japanese are a stretch though as a definable civilization they are about a thousand years separated from the Romans and Egyptians. The Barbarians as they exist in the game are entirely fictitious. With a slight alteration they could have been the Norsemen/Vikings or Mongolians and that would have been more thematic. Plus, when having a variety of civilizations to choose from adds so much to its appeal and staying power, it is pretty sad that so few were available in this initial offering. Portal should have taken a note from Terra Mystica, Summoner Wars: Master Set, Small World, etc. and not released IS without having included more races, like twice as many.

Unfortunately, IS needed more play-testing. The factions are unbalanced, scores can swing wildly due to bad card draws, and there are some really mean-spirited cards that can suck the fun out of the game when used round-after-round.

I've only played this one two-player, but it feels like it was MADE for two-player.  Take control of one of four different cultures that have their own decks for you, and your sharing another deck with your opponent.

After the beginning of each round where you pick new cards you get to build three different types of buildings in certain spots on your player board.  The actions are fun, engaging, combo-able, and can really get you into the game and wish you had just ONE more food or stone or whatever.

I really enjoy this 2 player card game!

Very very good little card-drafting, civ-building game that's not afraid to get a little hateful.  It's only going to get better as more expansions add more options.

[UPDATE: After one small and one large expansion, I can clearly say it keeps getting better as more cards become available.  Now you can tweak your deck to the type of victory you want to achieve.  You're still at the mercy of a bad draw, but you've got your marching orders now.  SO fun.]

        First thing which attracted my attention was amazing art. In the beginning I thought that It’s artist of Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy, but it’s different artists. Illustration for IS drew Tomasz Jedruszek and I should say big part of game’s popularity belongs to him.

	Imperial Settlers (IS) has streamline rules and you can easily start playing right after reading them. But first play for me was a bit harder (I didn’t play in New Era before). You should remember that after you build a building you get all resources which it gives. I think It’s one of the main features of the game – building a big combo chains. Another difficulty was that nation's cards are very different and from time to time you would be open last pages of rules with clarifications. It is minor inconvenience and after couple games you will have forgotten about them. Part of success depends of which cards you draw and sometimes fortune can be very rude and you can lose with big score.

 	In conclusion I should say that IS is a great game which play very fast and with low down time. I prefer 2 player game, with 4 player downtime increases.

Asymmetric engine-building card game with direct interaction? Sign me up!

Well, perhaps it's not quite as exciting as the above tagline. The direct interaction is pretty limited in scope, and there's a lack of positive interaction, so after a punitive strike each turn does become a little solitaire-y. We had some AP problems in my only play. But it remains an interesting game and I'd like to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
In its core it's an asymetrical game about making combos with cards. Every player has a different civilization and they all draw cards from a common deck and their own private deck, with special cards, more powerful, depicting the characteristics of his civilization.

The graphic design is just OK, but quite ineffective: the icons and texts are too small, and the illustrations a too similar. They are impossible to distinguish from afar, it makes it more difficult to follow what your rivals are doing.

You take most of the decisions at the start of your turn, depending on what cards and resources you have. It's quite straightforward, because each card only has 1-2 uyses at most, it's basically a question of deciding the best build order and a few things more. 

But it's very entertaining. You start with nothing, just a basic production, and each turn your civilization grows exponentially. At the end you'll have plenty of buildings around.

I think the replayability is quite low. I almost depleted my roman deck in my first play and I did not see enough cards to change the global strategy consistenly. It's a very expandable game.

It's definitly a game for 2 players, I would say 3 at most. Otherwise, it's very difficult to follow what your rivals are doing.

Criminally microscopic text for no reason, both on the cards and on the player boards, all this in a game where you are supposed to know which cards the other players have melded. How can you know that when you can't even read the cards in your own hand? The engine building here feels intriguing though, and there might be a game hidden somewhere but I am not willing to find out until a playable version is released.

The good thing is that Ignacy has finally had the sense to let someone else write the rulebook. The result is significantly better than before but there are still some essential rules hidden in side notes, which makes playing critically wrong way too easy. The overall layout of the rulebook could also use a bit of improvement.

ok card game, but not really balanced and relatively solitary. Having luck with the cards is crucial. And having enough people/meeples is required for drawing many cards to pick the good ones. Not all races have the ability to do this (some have a lack of people income).

RATING: 6
I was reticent to try this card-based civilization game, mostly because it just didn't seem like my type of game. First off, let me say that the game is brilliantly-designed; from the custom-carved wooden bits, to the synergy between cards and factions, Imperial Settlers is a great game for players looking for re-playability and card combos. But I can't see myself playing this game with more than two people and not tearing my hair out. While your turns are limited to just one action, the endless possibilities of how and where a card is played allows for too much AP to keep from people from enjoying the game. Maybe I'm a bit spoiled with a lot of the card-based games being streamlined and simplified by a sexy new app (Hearthstone, Magic), it would simplify a lot of your decisions and make everything more apparent for your strategy. Imperial Settlers is the AP juggernaut that everyone is afraid of: the game is four-person solitaire with no deference or care given to anyone around you. While the artwork and components are delightful and cute, the flow of the game is too much for me to recommend to any group of players above two.

RATING: 8
There's some interesting takes here on the engine building genre, mainly around the choices made on which cards to burn for their resources, which to build for their ongoing benefits, and which of your high-value cards you need to sacrifice to transform into resource producers. There's luck involved in what cards you draw, and therefore what combos to build (and protect), but with many choices on how to process those cards, careful play will do well. With so many choices comes the inevitable analysis downtime, and that can be significant - the down-point of the game. You need to expect that your best "common" buildings are going to get razed by an opponent, so there's a bit of take-that, but at least the person hit gets some compensation and the hitting mostly goes around the table. But it does present a hit-the-leader issue which can problematically decide games. Engine building is a well-worn path in game design and the card effects mostly follow the formula - get resources, turn those resources into either VPs or more resources. The game in feel reminds me of Homesteaders, where you have a ton of ways to convert your resources into different resources to get the buildings which will make your VP conversion as efficient as possible. Both games can get a bit head-spinny, which is not a bad thing if everyone's prepared for it. Having said all that, the game presents cleanly and provides a lot of avenues to explore, which therefore provides plenty of upside for repeat play.

Excellent 2 player game although it plays upto four...it also has a strong solitaire game ...I will only ever play either solitaire or 2p so can't comment on how it plays with more than 2 players.

One of the most exciting aspects is the promised periodic releases of expansions for the game through the introduction of more cards along with new civilisations this will only be a good thing ...adding more variety, and a bit of deck building/ tweaking marvellous !

Art and components ...the art will annoy some or them off the game because of its slightly comic cartoonish nature ...I happen to love this type of art...so it's a solid plus for me ...as to the components ...well here I have two downers, and they are both related to the cards...and when I say downers that's probally over stating it, as I have rated this game a deserving ten...the font size on the cards could do with coming up a couple of notches which I am sure can be done with future card releases if publisher desires it ...and the card stock ...this has always in my opinion been a slight failing in Portal games ...please please move onto linen finished cards it feels and works much better... I know it might be a tad more expensive but I would rather pay a bit more for the game and have lovely linen finished cards rather than know automatically if it's a Portal game I will need to buy sleeves for the cards automatcally ...I'd rather not have to sleeve my cards ...I guess it's too late now for this game but how about next years Essen release ...always assuming there is one ?

Game markers, player boards ...excellent cardboard nice an sturdy perfect thickness ...nice vibrant colours used...nice wooden pieces as well...

Rule book ...well written, well laid out and very colourful ...but too big would be much nicer A4 format ...much easier to handle...

So, over all 8/10 for components ( dropped two because of cards)

After first try: 

I didn't pay attention during rules explanation so I chose the wrong cards to start with, but when I understood the game I caught up pretty good, even if I didn't win. We made one major rules mistake, we didn't pay food for trades. This didn't do anything between me and the winner, but actually kept the losers less behind. 

This is just another resource-and build game, there are several similar games out there. I like the mechanics where you get to chose cards from different piles to get different types.

It's a very nice looking game, and also very easy to read and understand the functions of each card.

I love the theme, the artwork and streamlined gameplay. The playing time was an issue during my first (four player) game and it is hard to see the text on the cards belonging to the opponents. Otherwise, fantastic and I am certainly looking forward to the expansions

After six plays
Feels samey and a bit uniteresting.

Way too long with 4 players.  It may get better with fewer than 4, but I did not find it interesting enough to try.  It tries to add in some interaction that other economic tableau builders lack (such as RftG).  But the interaction seems forced and a bit silly.  Also, I could often see most everything I wanted to do in a round, but with everyone taking one action at a time, rounds just seemed to drag on and on and on.  I will stick with Race for the Galaxy.

Imperial Settlers is a pretty simple resource management card game, where you play cards to gain resources and convert them into other resources.  It's definitely more streamlined than its predecessor 51st State, in that cards are generally usable once per turn (instead of X times per game) and have clean iconology (albeit with tiny text).  That said, there wasn't anything about the game that really felt special, and the ability to destroy other people's cards left a sour taste in my mouth.  I haven't played enough to judge, but I'm also not convinced that the factions are balanced.

Rec'd on 12/27 via Coolstuff, $44. First play on 12/28. Learning game via son. First impression: this could easily replace Uchronia as our go-to game for a 30-minute (40 minute?) 2p after or before dinner. He liked it immediately, as did I. Love the custom deck feature, and confrontation is a more brutal than most German-style games.

Four player game took 2-3 hours. I love the theme and art. Amazing illustrations. Just pure looking at it is part of the fun. Some players don't like the 'Raze' part where you destroy their cards. I'd like to try the 'friendly' version where you don't kill each others cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Update: Alright, well after initially really liking it but still being somewhat cautious about it, it's dropped in rating from an 8 to a 6. The game is far too dependent on getting the right cards. I was absolutely hosed as the Romans and got 1 production building for 2/3rds of the game. I was able to pick up steam by the end of the 4th turn and 5th, but I was almost 40 points behind at the end. This game improved the overall clarity of 51st State, but it lost it's soul.



Not as good as 51st State/New Era, but it is smoother and easier to get to the table. I liked the different factions and the artwork is beautiful. No where nearly as aggressive as people are making it out to be. Sure you attack someones location, but you have to typically turn in a common location anyways to build a faction location. Except someone chose it for you.

My only complaint about the game is the extremely tiny font used and the very small icons used. I feel like they wasted a ton of space on the card and could have doubled the font size to make it at least legible from across the table. I also feel like this is another game that could have benefited greatly from iconography. 51st State is all icons and it becomes very easy to read across the table.

This should really be a 2 player game, 4 player game is too long for what the game offers. Also the razing mechanic does not work so well for 4 players - on one extreme it´s possible to gang up on perceived leader (so to not be one you should play sub-optimally). On other extreme the weakest player could get their locations razed also, because someone needed those resources. And if you don´t get a good start on production buildings then you might log behind the entire 3+ hour playtime with 4 players (no, it did not happen to me). The depth is also too shallow for that long game - I´d rather play some meatier game in that timeframe. I enjoyed my 2 player game though.

RATING: 7.5
Played Imperial Settlers last night twice. A clever asymmetrical design with good interaction. Definitely will be picking this up. The only downside is the general randomness one would expect from this kind of card game. Players that find the perfect combo can easily run away with the win. If you accept this going in, you can have fun. Game turns exponential take longer as the game approaches the end as players produce more resources to feed their game engine. This is counter to my preferred pacing preference. The font used on the cards could have been a bit larger as it is helpful to see other players tableau of cards.

I really enjoy this game. The theme and art is amazing, altough the text on the cards is quite small which makes it quite hard to see what the other players have. It's one of my favorite games as it offers a deep playing experience. However, if not all players are equally strong in boardgames or some got off to a bad start the game tends to have a lot of downtime for players.

RATING: 3
The game only lasts five rounds, but the final two rounds can involve 200-300 player turns, continuing for over two hours. Winning or losing is decided by the top few cards of your faction deck, whether you're lucky enough to get production cards during your first turn. If you're unlucky, then it's a hopeless slog. If you're lucky, then it's a slog and then you win. Either way, no fun at all for me.

This re-implements an older game called 51st State. This is certainly a more streamlined and improved design.

Not bad; artwork is certainly cute.

Initially, I was very excited for this Imperial Settlers as there are so many people on BGG that love it as a solo game. But for me, so far, this one is missing the mark. The production quality is beautiful and the mechanics are very straight forward. Judging from my solo games, I can definitely imagine that the game would be much more engaging with 3-4 players. As it stands, it seems that there is virtually no way to lose the solo game. I hope that the campaign mode will add some complexity to the solo mode, but I've only been able to play through the first episode. So, the verdict's still out!

Unbalanced 2 player game (5.5) - it really sucks when you don´t get production early (1st & 2nd round) and you see the opponent just takes off. And if you put too many production cards in the decks - the game becomes too long.

LOVE this game. Simple, Elegant and so much to think about when playing. The streamlined iconagraphy and card descriptions make it so easy to learn. You spend time playing and not trying to figure out rules. Player interaction is pretty good to as you are thinking about what to defend and what to "raze". Strategies are so diverse and dynamic in this one.

GF says that the "euro/resource engine/buildup type" of games are not her favorite (she despises agricola) but she enjoys this one.

3rd game: she likes it even more. We were definitely more aggressive with each other and it didn't feel unfair. If she razed my locations I felt like: "ok, no problem I'll tweak my strategy a little"... The get one wood back is such a nice touch and mitigates the loss. It's a good balance of psychological rewards and soft losses... This game doesn't have many things that ruin the fun and even the aggressive stuff is reasonable.

Overall:

This game has serious fun factor. So much to do all the time... 5 rounds of fun-fiddly goodness is very satisfying.

This is a really nice resource management game, where you are drawing cards from your personal asymmetrical faction deck and drafting cards from a general supply deck, to formulate a strategy, farm points and build your engine. There's a lot of attacking other players, but you can only take out their general deck stuff and not their powerful faction buildings. The faction buildings in most cases require you to take our your own stuff, so it's sort of acknowledged that you having that logging mill is transitory. I had a great time playing this. Punchy euros are something of a favorite of mine.

I quite enjoyed my first game of Imperial Settlers; the game mechanic was similar enough to other games I've played that it was fairly easy to get to grips with (though starting the game at 10pm and finishing after 1am probably didn't help my levels of concentration).

The artwork is very cute, and overall it's a nice design, which are things I'm perhaps overly invested in as a player.

(I will say that I'm not quite sure what to think of the factions chosen from a cultural portrayal/appropriation perspective, especially the Barbarians. Because I am That Person...)

UPDATE: I rated this a 4 but we were playing incorrectly! If you use a card's power to draw a card, you can draw from either your personal deck OR the common deck! In this game, the cards from your personal deck are far more interesting!

However, the game is still a cube-exchange one, and my rating for this will probably stay at 4.


Gameplay is smooth and moves at a brisk pace, but the core of the game is merely a get-cubes-to-get-more-cubes-to-get-VPs kind of game, a genre of game that I'm tired of.

In this game, the most interesting cards come from each faction's personal deck. These cards tend to be the most powerful in the game. However, in one game, a limited number come into play. So the game revolves around trying to get most of these cards built. I wished that all the cards in the game were as interesting as these faction cards -- most of the cards merely enable a player to get resources and/or VP at a somewhat better exchange rate.

Pros:
1. Believe the Unbelievable. After 1 round of this game, you think to yourself, there's no way I can get anything going. By round 5, you're dealing with this massive tableau. It's great watching your tableau grow.
2. Asymmetry. Every faction having their own deck keeps the game interesting.
3. Fun cards/artwork. The artwork is fun and the actions available on the cards are interesting.

Cons.
1. Not balanced. Some factions score more points than other factions no matter how well you play. 
2. Player Interaction. Player interaction is extremely limited.
3. Bored. I loved this game at first. Then played a few more times... then a few more... then just lost interest in it. 

Summary: A solid tableau builder. I enjoy this game enough that I won't get rid of it, but not so much that I break it out often. A good game to break out with new gamers to give them a taste of tableau builders. The solo experience is solid, but also gets boring after playing each of the factions a few times.

A neat little engine building game featuring nice art.   By end game, you feel like you've built a flourishing hive of production and victory points. 
However, the game breaking issue here is that every element of the engine you build must be drawn from one of two shuffled decks.   Given that this is a competitive game, this means that success is primarily dictated by your luck of the draw vs. others.

The art in this game, as Zee Garcia said, looks like a Facebook app. The art is corny and the theme is not my favorite, but the iconography/wording on the cards is certainly functional. Even with theme and art being important to me and missing the mark in Imperial Settlers, this game is in my top five games. The game play is brilliant and eloquent. Every time you think you are out of actions on a turn, you find another way to get more done. The back and forth of turns keeps you constantly engaged and taking actions. I have played one 4 player game, and I felt like it lingered a bit to long. I don't think I would play this one with more than 3, and that is only if everyone knew how to play, and played relatively quickly. I prefer two players. Once you start to learn how to make each faction do what they do, this game gets even better. ***Wife:9

A streamlined version of "51. State" with accessible theme. The post-apocalyptic setting of the predecessor was gloomy enough to scare off a lot of people (females especially). "Imperial Settlers" design & art won hearts of many ladies - my wife's included.

Is it a better game overall? Well, that's debatale. "51. State" is a gamer's game - more complex, with many diverse strategies. "Imperial Settlers", while being very similar, is easier to play. Faction decks do a good job in focusing your efforts (barbarians are good in conquering, romans in building etc.) But that doesn't mean the younger brother is mindless - no, it's still a very thinky game! And if you didn't play "51. State" - both of the games are engine-builders in which you try to set up a good production of resources early to  score lots of points later. Turns are fast, one action and next player is ready to go. Still, it can drag a bit, especially with full player count. Also, the number of turns is not limited - if you aren't doing well, you will be forced to pass early and than watch as everybody else play for what seems like eternity. But fear not! "Imperial Settlers" is a game that you need to learn and with time you will do better. 

To sum it up: the art's amazing, the mechanics simple, but the gameplay demanding. Learning new faction decks is a joy in itself, because all of them play differently. Flaws? There is some luck involved (card game, doh!) and watching everybody else play and do well while your empire's in ruins is not very fun - but can sometimes happen. Other than that, solid game!

EDIT: Sold. Played the base game a lot and the expansions unfortunately unbalanced the game - much higher scores, players not using cards from the expansions are are bound to lose.

This rating is very temporary. After one play I was very frustrated with the games length, not doing much each turn, and with the degree of aggression (it felt like one could work hard for something and have it destroyed with little benefit to self). We also got a rule wrong that slowed the game down so I can imagine why it may not actually suck.

You know? I really like Imperial Settlers. It's a very interesting, asymmetrical tableau building game. You've got your people (race, nation, ethnic group, sexual orientation (okay, not really), or whatever) and that has a deck and then you've got a common pool of cards everyone can draw from. You place cards which lets you get more resources (or more cards) and try to change those resources into other resources, cards, or victory points. It has conflict; you try to burn down your opponent's stuff while trying to stop him from burning down your stuff. It's not as big on direct conflict as I might be making it sound, it's really not, but it's there and an especially aggressive player might be able to really mess up your day. Also, this is another of those snowballing games, that is, you won't be doing much on the first turn but by the fourth turn the AP sets in and you've got so many disparate things going and so many actions to remember (and in what order to do them!) that it can be easy to get overwhelmed, specially' for new players. It's great fun though.

One of my favourite engine builing game. You can do 2-3 different things with every card, some choices are very hard when you have to pick just one way to use it. 

The game feels very solitaire like. It varies between different factions and games, sometimes destroying important building may swing the game but it may also be the only time you interacted with the other player. You get more interactions with more players but the game drags a lot with every additional one. It got to a point i consider it unplayable with 4 players. 

If you got any expansions deck building is a must. Without it game is just super random. It takes few additional minutes but after one time you may use it again if you are happy with the effect.

I don't mind solitaire feel since me and my better half like these kind of games, since we play it with 2 bad draging with more players is not a problem.

I am not sure why we needed a simplified version of 51st State, but Imperial Settlers does an ok job of introducing those mechanics to a wider audience. It definitely plays faster and I enjoy the way players can build their tableau, but I much prefer the grittier setting and the deeper gameplay of 51st State. The conflict in Settlers actually feels meaner to me since it is such a cutesy setting. It's a bit jarring to suddenly get attacked when you're out for a stroll in your apple orchard.

Very fun civilization building game with great components and faction specific decks. Even though this game has developed a reputation for being cut-throat, I've found that the occurrence of razing other player's buildings has been just a small part of the game. Also, this is one of the only games I own that I'll actually sit down and play solo.

Good engine building game.  Quick and engaging.

The biggest downside for me is that the text on the cards is extremely small and can be a challenge to see.

We've only played once so far, and we did a 'variant' of 'no attacking allowed'  Razing other's buildings is an important part of the game, so we'll play in attack mode next time we get this to the table.

Pretty, competent, but kinda unexciting? There's really not much to it after you strip away the 'cards do three things' hook... so gimmicky. Also, we found the Japanese player had a huge advantage unless attacked constantly, which is then not fun for the japanese player.

I was surprised how much I liked this game.  The different factions change the game dramatically.  I think it plays best as a 2 player game, but also feels like there is more take-that than with 4 players.

First game was a learn as you go type affair.  Luckily nobody seemed to mind and we had a fun time getting to grips with it.  Everyone enjoyed it, including me.
This is a keeper, but requires a players guide and a few rule clarifications before playing again.

2nd game. I'm finding that i want to like this game a bit more than i actually do. 2 games in and the barbarians won both.
The first game left me thinking i could have done better due to not knowing how it works.  The 2nd game left me thinking that i had lost by round 4.

Imperial Settlers is not a terrible game, but it is hardly inspiring as a multiplayer game.

Ultimately, a game of IS is nothing more than a long monotonous sequence of micro-conversions of resources into VP with no rewarding feeling of exponential efficiency... sure you get more resources to play with after a couple of rounds, and some cards bounce off each others but all of this is broken down into additional micro-actions, only adding to the procedural development of the game.

Solo is where Imperial Settlers shines, a little brighter at least, allowing combos to be uninterrupted by opponents turns, the AI pretty much razing your buildings as randomly as other players would (at least for factions other than Japanese).

Rating as per multiplayer experience however, as I expect most people buying to primarily be interested in games with 2-4.

Easy to learn.
We had about 5 plays with the different factions. So far it looks like one faction (Egyptians) looks stronger than another (Romans) and there seems to be a little bit of luck involved the way cards appear. For the rest we simply loved the game, the lay-out and the few pieces it takes to play (so you can take it with you on a holiday). Recommendable

RATING: 7.5
Incredibly fun and satisfying game, and while the structure stays the same, each round feels incredibly different from the last. The only issue is that there are some very powerful combinations that take more luck than skill to obtain, and the player interaction at times can feel more mean than it potentially could be.

when i was single, this was my favorite solitaire game. hands down. i thought the randomness would put me off, but somehow the game snowballs with a few extra card draws and ends up burning through most of your deck. i don't think that i've played this multiplayer since around the first month i bought it since it can draaag a little (or a lot) as people think. also, there's incentive to use swords or lose them which makes the take-that seem a little less strategic and more "sorry, don't hold it against me!" or random in the middle multiplayer rounds. 51st State re-imagined this sort of collect-build-destroy-replace cycle, streamlined it, took away the sting, and upped the theme ante. it's hard not to think that 51st State didn't replace Imperial Settlers for most people, and then Alien Artifacts replacing it in turn. beloved and underplayed though it is, i think i might purge this game in lieu of other resource snowball games like the Valeria series (with Mico art!!). now that i'm no longer single i haven't got the time to sit around and test my efficiency, so there actually might be a good deal more purging than replacing, however much i fondly remember these games and expansions.

RATING: 8
08-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Imperial Settlers has a CIV theme, but basically is a cardgame/ resource engine building game. In the game you take control of one of 4 factions (romans, barbarians, japanese and egyptians) and try to build as many cards as you can from either your faction deck (worth VPs, cool special abilties) or the general deck.

Each round you draft some cards, draw some cards, get resources from played cards and your faction abilities and play new cards. Each time you take an action, your opponent gets his action directly afterwards. So while turns can be longish, the game does not feel too solitarish. Buildings can also be razed, by yourself or opponents and are worth resources then.

Fun game, highly recommended. Wanted to own this game. Only downside is the huge box. This box could AND SHOULD have been A LOT SMALLER IGNACY.

Tedious, boring, without any innovation. 

Adding insult to injury, this game is easily twice as long as it needs to be due to players having to wait a round to build after trading for goods....which does not alter the game in any way other than making it excruciatingly longer. Excruciatingly because nothing interesting is happening in that time. I'll play Twighlight Imperium, Die Macher, etc., so length of game isn't an issue as long as the game play is INTERESTING.

Plus, don't let the cute artwork fool you, if played the way it is designed, this is a vicious game.

Bottom line, other games do the economic/civ engine much better.

This one is an engine builder through and through and while the theme isn't glowing, I like the cute artwork.

Early game, it really hurts to give up some of your cards since they have such potential...but you know what? You need that wood NOW or you are going to get behind.  Those are fun decisions.  I also like that you can't keep goods between rounds so you are always optimizing for what you have on hand rather than 10 turns down the road (though you get a few of those decisions as well).

The only negatives would be that you can get a bit card screwed if few production buildings get drawn.  If that happens the game may drag as you pass and everyone else has 30 things to do.  This is fairly rare though and most of our games have been close even when someone THOUGHT there was a clear winner.

I still need to explore this one more though.

Nice! I like the choices. Packed full of choices like which card to build and which to toss, and how. It's all very open. Mostly you'll go with production buildings to start with, but certainly not exclusively. A lot of the game is about seeing the path of resource acquisition and subsequent building acquisition.

The theme and simplicity of the card mechanic makes the game super easy to understand, learn and teach. One quick read of the excellent rulebook and you're away. With four different civilisations and so many cards you can get a decent number of plays out of this. Might be worth picking up the expansion sometime soon though.

The text is more often than not a lot smaller than it needs to be. Nothing I needed to bring out the microscope for (I'm thinking of one or two cards out of A Study in Emerald), but it would have been nicer if different not sizes were used and all the card real estate utilised. The contents of the box also needed a bit of an airing - the chemical smell is quite strong at first. Other than that the production quality is top notch.

The only issue I have with the game is that the last round can sometimes take an awfully long time. You'll have built up some decent production buildings and deals by this time. Combine that with current action cards and new buildings you'll build In the final round and the fifth round runs a little long with three or four players especially.

------------

With further play the game has bumped up another notch in the ratings. Speed of play has increased. Players are enjoying toying with the different factions and are hoping for some new ones in the future. Still some concern about the luck of the card draw, but if you don't get something good then you get something else good. It's all fun.

Sleeved. Bought like new from BGG auction. This was much easier to pick up after having learned 51st State Master Set a couple weeks before.  Mechanics are identical, just different theme.  I like the game a lot, especially after we started playing it correctly.  Between the four factions there is lots of variety and different strategies to pursue, from building up production to loading up on actions, including building machines that can cripple your opponents' options.  Look forward to playing again and possibly picking up some expansions.

My favourite euro! Excellent gameplay with empire building theme. Love the drafting mechanic together with interesting resource management. The conflict between players is muted. Razing other people's buildings just simplifies their decision about which building to scrap to build their faction building and gives them a wood to boot! The Roman engineer building (and a few others) is particularly nasty but it's just a one of and in many games you may not even see it. Great assymetrical balance overall even if initially the Egyptians may feel a bit overpowered. Also a great solo game!

I go back and forth with Imperial Settlers. The solo game is a fun way to learn the factions, but does not stand up to repeated play. Roughly half of the action locations do very little or don't work at all against the dummy player, the way the dummy player attacks discourages keeping common locations out for extended periods, and beating the dummy player is trivial.

The basic mechanics of Imperial Settlers are pretty good, although I think I would like the game better if it was a little less possible to combo chain into doing more and more stuff, and if it had a turn structure where you took multiple actions on a turn in order to speed up the game. Once I've planned out my next 10 moves, I would like an opportunity to execute it without having to wait for every step individually. In addition, the base game faction deck distributions were a bit too inconsistent. Some of the cards weren't very useful, and if you didn't draw the production you needed to get started in the first round, you were pretty far behind. 

I'm also not the biggest fan of some of the player interaction in the game. The rest of the game is about building your economic engine, but the way some of the more hostile actions work can be a little frustrating. I think the raze tokens work well on the whole, but I'm not always satisfied with the way the other attack options work out in practice.

The expansions help a lot with the card distribution issue, and allow you to make the faction decks more reliable. The addition of open production buildings also helps mitigate getting a start without the production you need. You want to avoid using open production if you can generate the goods you need yourself, since it also helps your opponent, but it allows you to get a lot more done without production of your own in case of a rough start.

Overall I enjoy Imperial Settlers when playing with people that play fast, but I think the expansions are kind of necessary.

i had a lot of fun playing, it wont make the collection it didnt wow me, i felt like i should have more choices when i draft if the game does not have you building many things during the rounds. empire building while only building just a few things felt off, the foundation mechanic was cool but also limiting, great game just not for me.

This is a reimplementation of 51st State and tho I love the post-apoc setting, this game takes the mechanics and does them right.  Really fun game.

After playing it again, I have to lower the rating.  It's a very fun game with 2p, but with 4p it really overstays it's welcome and can lead to ganging up - two things that really aren't fun for me.  I'd play it with 2p, but probably wouldn't be too keen on playing it with more than that.

This game was sort of a surprise. Both my friends and I said that the box art and the seeming inherent "Settlers" component to the naming caused us to dismiss this game. However, once I saw it being played and read some reviews, I picked it up. I'm not sorry I did. The game is easy to learn, but has a reasonable amount of depth. After only a couple plays (a 2-player game, a 3-player game, and a solo variant game), I would recommend this. It probably isn't going to knock the socks off hardcore game players, but the number of awards it's won seem justly earned.

Imperial Settlers treads down the familiar path of card-driven, engine-building games. What's somewhat novel here are the attempts to balance out elements in the game; there is some destructive interaction in terms of razing opponent's buildings, but attacked players are able to turn razed locations into a foundation for bigger things. Also, players are able to make deals to compensate for a lack of resource cards early on. 

My main beef with Settlers is that the last two rounds often [i]feel[/i] stretched because players are engaged in a gazillion micro-conversions as they wring their engine dry. This is further worsened if the cards have simply stacked in favour of a particular player, and you can only watch on as he steamrolls his way to victory. The tiny text fonts also make it frustrating to read the cards in your opponent's tableau. As it stands, the current rating is for 2P games in which the listed drawbacks are mitigated; the rating steadily decreases with more players on board.

#78 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Each player controls a faction of people with their own unique ability. Players draft cards to play into their tableau, accumulating victory points in various ways. There is also a method for attacking other player's stuff.
I definitely want to get in more plays of this because I feel like there are a lot of strategic paths to explore with each faction. I like it more on my second play than my first, which is usually a good sign.

Initial impression is that there is not a lot of interaction. There are a few annoying cards that increase interaction (eg, engineers), but the cost to use them is fairly high so that their use is more surgical in nature. I think we need to get more comfortable on how the decks work on their own before we understand when attacking each other is called for.

At the moment, we just bury our heads in our own tableau so deeply that we don't even know who's turn it is (which is just as well, since we rarely raze each other's locations anyway). Michelle commented that while the game is fun enough, it is not a fun way to spend time together. I can't see us ever picking up any of the expansions.

This game is a very fun cute and strategic game. It borders somewhere between a gateway and a heavier game. It's very satisfying pulling off a great combo with your cards and resources to maximize points and putting down buildings. This game rewards skill level and the more you play it, the better you'll get at it.

Really the art here, hits the "whimsy" spot really well.  The attacking isn't as bad as I feared - the fact that being attacked leaves you with a bare foundation and a wood makes the choice of what foundation to use for your next faction building an easy one.  My only and biggest complaint is that it is terribly hard to tell what cards your opponents have built in their empires until you are very familiar with the game.  Iconography instead of small blocks of text would have been very welcome.

Az 51st State játékot gondolta újra a szerző és célja annak javítása, eladhatóvá tétele volt. Nos, ez véleményem szerint tökéletesen sikerült. A történelmi, valós népek és gyönyörű grafika sokkal barátibb, mint a posztapokaliptikus sötétség. A játék hasonlóan zajlik, de mégis valahogy letisztultabb, egyszerűbb. Van egy saját és van egy közös paklink, amiből a kör elején lapot kapunk, majd termelünk és kezünkben levő lapjaink leépítésével fejlesztjük a birodalmunkat. A lapok ugyanúgy háromfunkciósak. Rombolhatók, körönként kinyerhetők belőlük termékek és használhatjuk a tulajdonságaikat is. A játék két fővel tökéletesen működött, egyértelműnek látszik, hogy ez az optimális játékosszám. 
Nézzük a felmerülő negatívumokat. 

Apró betűk a kártyákon. Tényleg kicsik, de szerintem tökéletesen láthatók. 

Hosszúság. Az 51-es szerintem hosszabb, elsőre nekünk is hosszú volt, de pár parti után, mikor minden kártya ismerős lesz, szerintem abszolút elfogadható a játékidő. Az utolsó kör nagyon hosszúra nyúlhat, számomra felvetődött az egy körrel rövidebb játék ötlete, de lehet úgy kiegyenlítetlen marad, illetve nem tudunk igazán kiteljesedni. 

Egyik nép erősebb, mint a másik. Itt érzek némi igazságot. Két játék alapján nekünk az egyiptomi tűnik erősnek és a japán kicsit gyengébbnek, de mindegyik játszható és mindennek van ellenszere, tehát nem is annyira a népek kiegyenlítetlensége a negatívum, hanem az a szerencsefaktor, ami a kiegyenlítetlenséget ellensúlyozná, azaz, hogy a megfelelő lap kijöjjön az erős lap ellenében. Két játék alatt kb. a saját paklink fele fogyott csak el, pedig próbáltam abból húzni, ha erre lehetőségem volt, mégse jött ki minden fajta lap. Ezt még további partik fogják eldönteni mennyire van erre ráhatásom és mennyi a szerencsefaktora a játéknak. De ha csak minden tizedik parti végződik nagy különbségű végeredménnyel, az szerintem elfogadható.

Összességében első játékra nekem két személlyel tökéletes volt. Két nagyon szoros partit játszottam, amit végig élveztem. Szóval én nem tudok belekötni igazán. Nagy újrajátszhatóságot érzek már az alapjátékban is. Nagyon erős 7-es. Ha hárman és négyen is ki tudom próbálni, illetve a szerencsét tudom még tesztelni mindenképpen nőhet a pont.

[2015-08-08]
Újabb két parti után, ahol sikerült kipróbálni a másik két fajt némileg romlott a véleményem a játékról. Egyrészt a japánok tényleg gyengébbek, mint a többiek, a másik három kb. hasonlóan erős. A véleményromlás két dologból fakad. Egyrészt a szerencse. Két hasonló képességű játékos partiját egyértelműen az fogja eldönteni. Nekem elég logikus minden lépés, adja magát melyik kártyát kell leépíteni, használni vagy szerződést kötni vele. Tehát kicsit mechanikussá válik. A másik dolog pedig a játék hossza. Korábban azt írtam nem vészes, de most újabb két parti egyenként másfél óráig tartott, ami kicsit azért hosszú egy kétszemélyes viszonylag könnyed játék esetén. 1 óra elég lenne egy parti esetén. A játék nem rossz, a pontján se rontok még. Szeretném többen is kipróbálni, utána mondok majd végső verdiktet.

Imperial Settlers is exactly my kind of game. It takes several of my favorite mechanisms, chiefly multi-use cards, engine building, and asymmetrical play, and combines them into a deep and highly re-playable game. While each faction is different, how you play is not. So rather than having to relearn the game for each faction, you simply have to discover the nuances that they add. It's simple to learn, but difficult to master. However you choose to approach it, it's a very enjoyable game and one of my all-time favorites.

This is based on just solo plays so far. It may rise or fall with time and multiplayer experience. I think that multiplayer would be much better, as some of the cards become uninteresting/useless during a solo game. Maybe I'll try removing those cards for solo play, or maybe keep them as there is still some worth for razing for resources. 

This makes a great little solo game. I look forward to exploring it much more in this fashion as well as playing it multiplayer as soon as I can!

Played once with 2 other new players at Dice Tower Con. 
The Egyptian player totally dominated the game scoring more VPs than the Japanese & Romans combined. Not sure if this is because I am terrible, the Egyptian player is a better gamer, or if the game is balanced. (Probably a combination of the first two reasons!) Some of the card descriptions were a bit confusing (e.g. Japanese Trade Routes).

The game lasted much longer than I expected (2 hours+), but that is probably because it was the first game for all 3 of us. Definitely need to play again with another faction but the overall first experience wasn't that much fun.

While I certainly like this more than 51st State, as the interaction is more prevalent (if also more frustrating), I still find the use-it-or-lose-it aspect of the resources to be more maddening than enjoyable.

RATING: 3
There's some take-that interaction, but Imperial Settlers is a mostly solitaire engine-building card game where players get goods, convert them into other goods, and pump out victory points. Most of the VP generation occurs around the mid to late game. General strategies are baked into the four faction decks, and successful execution depends on the cards players happen to draw in the early to mid game. Some cards are a lot more useful than others, and it's entirely possible that you'll never see your most useful cards, or you'll see them too late in the game for them to make a difference. In any case, it's highly unlikely that I'll ever see them. I'm just not interested in this sort of experience.

Pros
- Great art and component quality
- Good replayability with 4 factions to choose from

Cons
- So many cards that do so many things with small font that I sometimes do sub-optimal plays just so I don't have to spend the time to read the cards my opponent just played
- It often feels like I lose because my opponent drew better cards at the right time than I did
- Rounds can sometimes seem to go on forever because of the resources you get back constantly from playing certain cards

This is a fun little game that we still pull out from time to time, but ultimately is overshadowed by a lot of other games on our shelf.

RATING: 7.5
1 play, 3er

Players each have their own, nation-specific deck. In addition, there's a common deck of cards. There are 5 rounds in the game, each with the same sequence:
1. Draw one card from your own deck, then draft 2 cards from the common deck.
2. Produce resources based on your race and the cards in your tableau
3. In turn order, players use their resources and cards in their display to take a single action, continuing until everyone passes. Actions allow you to draw more cards, play cards into your display, activate cards (for resources, cards, VP, etc.), convert resources, etc.
4. Cleanup: discard all your remaining resources, except whatever your nation can store.

Each nationality plays differently, with cards that give everyone different abilities. The common cards can be built into your display, like the nation cards, but can also be raided to get more resources. You can also raze other players' common cards (and the Japanese player's cards) for resources. If a player's card is raided, as compensation they get one wood (resource). Also, razed cards are not totally useless: they flip upside down to become foundations, which can be used the help play other cards. Still, you do lose the card's special ability! Fortunately, there's not necessarily a lot of raiding -- the required swords are not so plentiful!

Wow, cool game! It doesn't seem particularly balanced, but that could just be inexperience talking. Or maybe the Egyptians are just too easy to play / strong? I definitely want to play this again!

I love variety and variability in my games and for that reason I really like this game in what it provides to players and how it plays.  However, there are certainly some balancing issues that keep me from loving it.

The game is a light pseudo-civilization building game.  Each player picks a faction which comes with it's own deck of cards as well as slightly different production and a different resource they can store (all other resources not spent are lost between each of the game's 5 rounds).  There is also a common deck of cards and each of these cards shows a different building that can be built and added to your civilization.  These buildings either produce a resource every round, provide a new action that can be taken during future turns usually at the cost of resources, or give your civilization a passive ability.

I call it pseudo-civilization building because what it really is is a much simpler tableau building game.  The game even at max players can play in an hour, is completely card driven and the card play is 99% of the game.  There is no other combat mechanism or technology tree.

While the decks aren't super varied they provide enough options and the asynchronous player factions/decks offer enough more variety that I am constantly interested and able to pursue different paths to victory with each play.  There's also a decent amount of player interaction, if you want there to be.  You can certainly play this game with a much more hermit-like mindset worrying just about advancing your own civilization and ignoring your opponents, hopefully they ignore you back.  All of this keeps me very engaged.  However asynchronous games absolutely NEED balance to work and this game doesn't have it.

The Egyptian faction is far and away better than the other three.  A new player playing this faction can beat even experienced players playing another pretty regularly.  The Egyptians in the hands of an experienced player will probably win 99 times out of 100.  Every time something like this is brought up you are going to see just as many or more people claiming no, the Egyptians are not overpowered.  They're wrong, they're just fanboys that can't stand to have criticism brought against a game they like.  The Egyptians make the game no fun for anybody.  Sure, you could just not play with this faction but then you are left with just 3 options and no way to play the full complement of 4.  This faction legitimately hurts the game.

In fact, in general the one thing I wish they did was put more factions in the game.  They announce unashamedly in the rulebook that expansions are in the works and not only will we get new factions but the ability to build our own faction decks by mixing cards from all the factions.  Until then though even with the varied different decks and playstyles playing the same 4 will get old and nobody wants to play with the Egyptians in the game.  I don't know how this faction got through the playtesting process with the pedigree of the designer behind it.

Has become less and less fun with each play. Seems like each deck is too small and only has 1 set of best plays.  this game has continued to worsen, the more i try to enjoy it.  it feels like playing mexican train, just line up your plays and wait for everyone else to make theirs.

Had a 7.5 rating for this game, played some more and raised it to 8, definitely gets better with more plays. One of my favorite games, love the cutesy art work, love the different wood resource pieces and satisfaction of crabbing and spending them, love the designer (gotten Robinson Crusoe after playing this game). It's a game ideally for 2 people, 3 max, solo is fun if you like to compete with yourself for victory points. 4 is way to long especially playing with beginners.

Fun game that takes some work to piece together successfully. Small learning curve and needs some familiarity to really exploit. Multi use cards creates lots of interesting decisions and combos. Like the assymetry, but needs a couple more factions. Can be repetitive until your engine is really ramped up, and then it can be fiddly and a bit longish.

Played with 2 twice, using a combination of all factions.  High luck factor, but it does have a relatively short playing time.  I enjoyed trying to gain the max efficiency of my cards and find some cool combos, but probably not enough to buy it.  

I'm not sure why I liked this more than 51st State.  I'd have to replay it to find out, and that may be unlikely.

I taught this at Spiel '14. It is a fast playing game that doesn't let you doze off because actions are quick and the turn comes back around to you quickly. The game slows down with more players, however, and I think it is best with two players. It's pretty cool to build up your empire and it is done in a different way to other games. The factions fit well into an antiquity theme except the Japanese who were on the other side of the world geographically. Egyptians seem to have the edge in the game but more plays will tell how balanced the factions are. Razing was hard to explain and many players got this wrong, it was difficult to understand that you cannot raze your own locations, but you can if they are in your hand. Still it was one of my top picks of the fair.

My rating for solo play. Will probably rate higher after more plays. Fantastic medium weight solo game. Variety of factions and action cards keeps this game interesting every time. Plays in less than thirty minutes and it's quick to setup and reset, so I usually play 2 or 3 games at a time. I like that I have to beat the virtual player, and also earn a score which is compared to a ranking. Every game is always so close at the virtual player is within 1 or 2 cards of beating me. You have to keep a constant eye on what the virtual player has, what it might collect, and what it might be able to attack. That makes this one of the most "interactive" solo games that I play.

Absolutely loving this game at present which is solely down to the solo campaign recently developed. This is probably one of my first games that I prefer to play solo due to the tactical nature of dealing with the cards you start at the beginning of each round and by using resources and combo's, trying to make those cards give you the most benefit, whilst also ensuring that you still pay the upkeep cost of the provinces you have conquered (campaign solo play) which makes the game tougher but more rewarding. Only have had a 2 player game once which was good, not sure if I would would want to increase to 3 or more due to the logistical difficulty of seeing all your opponents cards which rely heavily on a lot of (small) iconography.

Very fun and quick game (with 3 people). The factions feel very different and the game is engaging. My only problem is that it feels heavily luck based with skilled players and I question the balance a bit. However, I'm definitely enjoying it and want to see how long it holds up.

I kept reading about this game and I just had to try it.  It is not a good fit for my family so I knew it would be for solo play only.  I just finished my 10th game...wanted to try each faction a few times.  I love the components, the theme, and the art, but...I am terrible at this game.  On my last game I just gave myself some of the best Roman cards to start the game with and I still had a bad score...I topped 50 only once or twice.  On my last play I realized I was kind of forcing myself to like it.  I have too many games I really do like so sadly this will end up on my trade list.  I still think it was a great game it just wasn't a good fit for me.  Don't worry Ignancy I still have Hex and love RC!

This is a multiplayer solitaire - you can really feel a lack of player interaction in this one. Overall, its a fine game but I wouldn't go out my way to recommend it with great praise. Neat little game with some great artwork that's relatively fun and easy to follow.

Regarding player interaction, the ability to raze allows for a bit of interaction, and so do some of the cards, but overall it's a more solitary game in which you try to build your civilization engine. I was also not a fan that the cards were random and didn't change (read: upgrade/become better) per round, as this could have made for a more epic "civ building" feeling. Also, this game could induce some analysis paralysis. However, I will admit that it is a pretty decent game and might need more than 1 play to be judged fairly.

A játék jó, minden megvan benne, ami kell: igazgatjuk a kis birodalmunk lapjait (ami nagyon élvezetes), építgetünk, közben azért van interakció is. Ráadásul ez utóbbi nagyon intelligensen van megoldva: ha leromboljuk egy másik játékos épületét a romokat használhatja a károsult, tehát - sok más (rossz) játékkal ellentétben nem jelent egy vagy két épület elvesztése végzetes bukást és vegetálást a játék további részében. A különböző népek különböző tulajdonságai jó alternatívákat kínálnak a győzelmi utak megválasztásához. Szépen el van találva! Szóval a Birodalmi Telepesek egy igazán jó játék.
DE! Van két nagy problémája:
1. a magyar kiadásban a szövegek annyira apró betűvel vannak írva, hogy érdemes lenne nagyítót is mellékelni a dobozba. A saját lapokat is csak úgy látja jól az ember, ha egészen közel hajol hozzá. A másét elolvasni játék közben esély sincs, pedig ez igencsak fontos! Ilyen hibát!!! Nagyon gáz, elrontja a játékélményt.
2. Annyit el lehetett volna érni egy magyar kiadásban, hogy mondjuk ne barbárok legyenek a 4. nép, hanem hunok. Teljesen illene a játékba, szinte kívánja! Attól félek meg sem próbálták. Elég mostohán bántak a kiadással, lásd a c.a. 6-os betűméretet. Lehetett volna jobban szeretni ezt a játékot, ha már kiadják!
2. Hosszú, a játék előrehaladtával nagyon belassul.

Oh boy. This seems to be another overhyped Euro.

Yes, it has nifty multiple ways cards can be used. Art is clean, gameplay is probably enjoying. However, looking further down the road... this seems to be an absolutely forgettable Euro.

It really has nothing new, nothing it stands out on. Even the theme is just 'ok'. 

There is not much to pick on, but there is absolutely nothing that makes it stand out to me as in: "get it!".

Well, maybe I'm just burnt on Euro's. Now why do I like Terra Mystica and Eclipse so much...?

I enjoy this game despite its flaws.  I really like asymmetrical play in games, and this one does a good job at faction balance, in my opinion.  The mechanics are straightforward, and there's just a bit of "take that," without making being on the losing end of the affair too terribly punishing.  My main complaint is that this game suffers from what many card games suffer from; a substantial luck component.  If you just happen to get lucky and get the faction cards that will get your engine going quickly, you can make an early run and get a lead that's difficult to overcome.  Nonetheless, all of our games have played out fairly closely.

When [thing=73369][/thing] was explained to me as [thing=28143][/thing] but better, I got pretty exited, as that is one of my top 2 ever games. But after playing it twice, my review is more like: somewhat like RFTG but not nearly as good. They're both card games in which you build a tableau, but other than that they don't have too much in common.
I remember feeling that something didn't sit right with the game, but I don't remember what that could have been.
Imperial Settlers is a rethemed version of 51st State. Or so the splainer told me. That could very well be as some of the elements sounded familiar indeed, but it's been a couple of years since I played 51st State. But whatever didn't sit right with that game, didn't bother me this time around.
The mechanisms work fine and the game goes along at a very pleasant pace. Everyone has a different faction with a different starting set, which should add to the replay value. One thing that annoyed me slightly is that all of us only used a small part of their deck. I used every chance I had to draw cards from my deck, yet I only went through about a third of the deck. If the card's you are planning for are in the other part of the deck, you're out of luck.
A very enjoyable game, but I'm not sure yet about how good it actually is.

There are so many issues with this game. What if you never draw the cards you need for your engine/end game scoring? What if all the players decide to raze your buildings because they happen to give them what they need? What's to stop you pummeling endlessly on the player in last place?

If I want to stop another player building their VP engine how am I meant to know what their cards do if they're across the table from me without either walking over to them or asking them to explain, in detail, what each of their cards do? I can barely see what the cards of the person next to me do.

What if I want to do something different to the script for my race?

Just tedious, heads down engine building with random take-that and terrible design choices.

Fun. Shouldn't be as compelling as it is solo, but I'm determined to get every province in the campaign for some reason. The solo campaign adds some much needed meat to it, and randomly selecting an AI faction from the expansions is a good way to add challenge. I have yet to play with other players, which speaks volumes about my score: it's already that good, but I expect multiplayer to be better. Not sure I'm interested in 3-4 players, but 2 has got to be good.

Love this game, Group said they like it after 1 play but I wasn't really satisfy with the minimal players interaction (I was using Atlantian but it cannot raze arghhhh). Some enjoyed the raze action but some played defensively with aggressive faction. I think we need to play more games to understand how to taking advantage of the faction's ability, and which faction to choose from for each person's play style - I love how flexible this game offers in terms of the play style.

My go to tableau building game. This has replaced 7 wonders for me. It gives me that same feeling of building up my civilization but with really interesting resource management. Moreover, it adds both asymmetry between the various factions and much more interesting player interaction. Of course, 7-Wonders plays much quicker (with experienced players) and it can handle a much higher player count and so it will probably stick around in my collection.

Combo-building card game in the guise of a civilization builder. Learning the strategy for each faction will be key. I've played solo and 2-player. I imagine the "take that" aspect would only be greater in a multi-player experience. That said, I was a little disappointed by the overall feel of multi-player solitaire. The turns are quick, which is a positive that minimizes downtime, but this is really a game that is about optimizing lots of small interactions. I'm worried that it's all just too much chrome for what is essentially a straightforward concept accomplished equally well by other, shorter and smaller card games.

And a note about the components. The artwork is cute and creative, but hardly fitting for a civ-type game about invasion. Moreover, the icons and text are tiny -- and I mean minuscule -- which is really too bad.

Really fun, medium to light, tableau-building game with cute graphics. Really fun game play. I am a bit concerned about its replay-ability. 

The official solo variant is not that good. It actually does not work with some of the factions (Japanese, Egyptians). There is also a solo campaign variant, created by Ignacy, that I have not tried yet. It seems to be good.

I was pleasantly surprised by Imperial Settlers.  At first glance it seemed like there was too much going on and I didn't like the idea of razing cards.  After a few plays the razing doesn't bother me, although I think the game would be just as good with the food resource or deals.  I enjoyed how differently each faction felt and I like the drafting mechanism a lot.

Fun and relatively simple tableau building game with differentiated factions.  The art is nice, but comes at the expense of readability, especially when trying to suss out what the opponent has.

I definitely want to try The 51st State now.

RATING: 6
It's a game about making combos. Making combos once you have got your production started and the cogs of the machine work smoothly together. Bad for you, if you didn't get any cogs to boost your production with in the beginning and start with potential combo power cards you have no clue about wether it's worth keeping them on hand as you don't know if you get the needed cards to trigger the combos later on. Much, much too long for what it is. Compared to Race for the galaxy, a game I once rated 10 but dropped to an 8 for the very same flaw, this one takes the win concerning the empire building feel, but even when you know the game well, it'll never play as fast as RftG does. It's just too thinky for that.

As a fan of 51st State, I'm surprised by how streamlined this use of that system is. It's a lot simpler and fills a different niche for me, but I'm having a lot of fun with it. Four asymmetrical factions, difficult decisions over how to order your actions, and its breezier gameplay make this one of my current go-to games when I'm not in the mood for something heavier.

RATING: 7
Really just a top flight Engine Building game... it doesn't quite match to depth and complexity of a title like Terraforming Mars, but it also manages to be at least a little bit more approachable for casuals, and perhaps more importantly, runs faster and involves less cleanup/teardown. Also unlike Terraforming Mars (and many games of all stripes claiming to have one), it's Solo Variant is quite pleasing. My biggest issue is as someone who hates "Gotcha"/"Take That" mechanics, the the Razing mechanic is a bit too focal in play... there's a pacifist variant in the core guide that restricts this component I highly recommend if you're in a similar boat, but there's no wheedling it out completely... While I'm under the impression 1 or 2 may be out already, I'll definitely say it could benefit from some expansions adding factions... while not unbalanced per say, they four base civs all play different enough that it can feel like you're all using the same score system when playing differnt games. I'll also say that despite being pretty simple, teaching yourself to play from the guide or a tutorial video... murky wording and pacing doesn't help. If you know someone who has played before, try to get them to teach you

This game just hits a sweet spot for me. I love civilization building, this has it. I love resource management, this has it. I love card drafting, this has it. The theme is perfect for me and the artwork and graphic design make me so happy every time I pick up the box. The feel of the game is lighthearted but the depth will keep you coming back for more. Each civilization that you play will feel different and require you to make different decisions. There is a deck building aspect as well that creates tons of variability and replay value. Imperial Settlers also has the best solo variant of any tabletop game I have ever played. The solo mode keeps the same feel of the game play and allows you to perfect the strategies of each civilization without having to round up a group to play. There is an "AI" deck so to speak included with the game and separate rules for the incredible solo version of the game. There is also a wonderful free campaign mode released online by this game's incredible designer Ignacy Trzewiczek that you can download and print to create even more depth and replay value to the solo mode. This game is a masterpiece in my opinion and one that I will never get rid of. I believe in this game and I believe in this company. Portal games makes quality products and because they are not a major corporation with hundreds of employees they take personal care and attention to the details of their games and the passion shows. So if you have a chance, go out and buy Imperial Settlers. I don't think you will regret it.

Civ (well, Tableau) building with asymmetric factions is something that allways gets me. It helps if the game has good standing as a solo game, too, in addition to multiplayer viability. First solo play as barbarians to get a feel and this is an instant hit with me. Has chances to even go higher.

I think I'm prepared to call this a Top 5 game for me.  It's quickly becoming one of those "stuck on a desert island" games for me because of the solo mode.  I love this game so very much.  Still want to sink more into the mechanics of playing the Japanese faction (right now I go to Egypt most often).  There are just so many things to love about this game.  I love the card drafting, which I think more than adequately provides strategy around the "card luck" aspect of the game.  I love the art and the theme, and the extra care our dear Ignacy showed in giving each individual card a thematic sense.  It's just a beautiful game to behold on the table come round five.  Plus, and this always wins me over for a game (like Among the Stars or Machi Koro), I enjoy getting to tell a story of my tableau as it builds more and more.  This game gets me invested in my little empire and the types of locations they have running.  It's just a home-run, and I'd love to see it crack the top 50 on the BGG overall list.

**update: I've officially declared Japan my faction of choice.  I'm sure you needed that information for your records, reader.

I really quite enjoyed this game the first few times I played it then the more I played it the more I felt like it was a crap shoot. Shuffle that faction deck and hope that the quality early game cards come out early in the game and not during the last round. Sucks to see the Roman warehouses for instance hide away but then you draw it in the last round. Cards are such an important resource and to draw one late game that is basically useless is a big hindrance. For me it feels like the game really boils down to who's deck produces best for them. It's not so easy to mill that deck out either or I wouldn't be this harsh on the game.

There's a lot to like in this game (multiple uses of cards and resources, asymmetric civilizations, a strong building theme etc), but not everything is good. Our 4 player game took 3 hours, which is way too long for what a light/mid game like this is supposed to be. I was also not a fan of the "razing" mechanic.

I'd like to try the non-razing variant with 3 or perhaps just 2 players. I'd probably enjoy the game a lot more that way.

RATING: 6.75
Imperial Settlers waddles up to the table sporting an adorable cover. There's a smiling puppy on the cover! Everything seems so cute... until you start to play. As you listen to the rules explanation and how an opponent can raze your buildings to the ground, you start to realize that this might not be a cute and adorable game after all.

This is a game about building cards, to get stuff, to build more cards, to score points. Or... erm... you're a civilization trying to build the best civilization. Or something. But there's cards that do cool things that let you combo on other cards with all sorts of neat interactions.

I remember starting the game and thinking that five turns didn't seem like enough time to do anything in the game. It didn't really seem like there was much you could do on your turn... but as it turns out there are a lot of ways that you can build buildings that let you open up new opportunities on your turn and turns start to spiral out with everything you can do.

Some cards give you stuff every turn. Some cards let you trigger off things you've already built. Some cards let you do cool actions. Communal cards don't give you as many points as your personal faction cards, and your personal cards have civilization specific abilities, some of which are pretty cool. Cards can be built, but some of them can be turned into "deals" (a free thing every turn), or "razed" (sacrificed for a one-time payout of something).

To raze a card in your hand requires a sword token... but you can spend two sword tokens to raze an opponent's already built building. But it's not all frowns for the other guy as he gets a wood, and his razed building can be built over. As most of the building require you to build over an existing building anyway, that's not so bad. Of course, if it's a building you really needed it can be painful.

Apparently there are concerns about game balance. First, because there are a lot of cards and you may never see the "good" cards in your deck. And second in that some civilizations are just better than others. It's hard to have an opinion on that after a single play.

Egypt did seem pretty powerful, but the Barbarians finished right behind them. And while Rome didn't do so well in this game, the player who won with Egypt won with Rome in his previous play. Japan didn't seem to fare so well, but I wasn't really paying attention to what other people were doing very much, so I don't really know why that was. To be fair, Rome nixed a building that would have score Japan a lot of points, so that did seem a little unbalanced, but I'm not sure that it really changed the outcome very much.

I was worried at the outset that the "take that"-ness of razing buildings would be painful, but it only happened a few times and didn't really seem to put anyone out too much. The destroy a building power of Rome was a fear until I realized that I didn't have a particular building that really was key to my plans... something that probably bothered Japan a bit more. My one real frustration with the game is that it probably is a good idea to know what other people are doing, and it's hard enough to track everything you're doing much less anyone else.

I really enjoyed this game. Trying to figure out the cards and puzzle out a plan to make everything come together was a lot of fun.

RATING: 8
This game definitely lives up to its Hype!!  It is just fun to play.  

I do agree about the name of the game (not great), and some of the print although very easy and intuitive, it is too small to see across the table, and you definitely need to be aware and know what buildings you need to "raze".... (Eliminate) from your opponents empire....!!  You also need multiple plays, to really start knowing the combos and what to look for.

In the end this game will get smothered with expansions, and have great replay value, but then will be too much I think, although a few new Factions will be awesome.   

Buy it, and play it, very intuitive, and a lot of fun.  

Would be a 9, but can be a slight bit finicky, and the size of the print and symbols on the cards is too small.

But again, buy it, it is a great game!!

Overshadowed by the improvements made in 51st state. The double dose of luck introduced by drawing randomly from two decks (made worse with expansions) and no way to reorder things can make the game streaky and eliminate a player from the running to win before it even begins.

The game would be a "10" if these issues were addressed in the design. As it is, it has some warts that only get more glaring when you throw in expansions.

I've only played this twice. With both you can see the luck in the draw. Some people will get victory point engines going early in the game and some won't. Raising seem to hinder people who got their engines going early slightly as the common cards didn't make much difference to the victory point generation. Also raising meant that the player in last place got to decide which of the other players would win. I'm not a fan of that. The resource generation and management with the card building is fun but the frustration of doing everything you can and seeing your opponents burst to the lead in victory points is frustrating.

After ~25 plays, I'm still trying to figure this one out (mostly played 2 player, no expansions).  I don't mean the strategies, but rather what I like and dislike about this game.  In some ways, the game plays plays simply and beautifully.. and I'm hooked.  In other ways, it just feels like something is off.  Something is missing or not fully tested. 

My first 10 plays or so were with the general rules for the "Lookout Phase" (card drafting).  I recommend ignoring those and just diving in to the advanced rules.. this lets you base your success somewhat more on your strategy and less on luck of the draw. 

But still, some games everything can be running smoothly, and other games not at all.. and it's often just because you can't seem to get a single building that doesn't require a foundation (or other building) cost.... or no production whatsoever... or something similar.  These games aren't often, but when they happen they can be frustrating. 

Pros:
+Fun gameplay
+Love asymmetric "civ" game (though I use civ loosely)
+Some "take that" but it's not too strong nor even necessary in many cases to be effective
+Great artwork.  Unlike many, I LOVE the box art.. but I also love the card art. 
+Well balanced, overall

Cons:
-Some concerns about consistency of balancedness due to poor card draws.  Maybe this will be fixed with more plays... but I've just seen some starting hands that.. *shiver*  It's difficult to catch up.

Update: 7/12/2017
Really getting the hang of deals early on to make the best of no production card draws, as well as using workers to draw new cards.  The combination of these techniques has increased my love for the game 10-fold. Gets better every time.

Update 10/19/2017
Game continues to improve.  Solid game; give it a chance and let it grow.  You have to get familiar with the mechanics, especially Deals, to get things moving along well.

Imperial Settlers is a solid, fun, tactical resource/hand management game for 2 or 3 players. Each round is a tactical puzzle, building more cards and shifting around resources, in which you try to use all options open to you the best you can. And there can be quite a lot of options near the end of the game! I really like the (very) different faction decks and the interaction between them. But be aware - since you only get to draw part of your faction deck each game, the speed at which points are earned can be rather swingy. Just handsomely won a game through a card that I drew in my last turn.

RATING: 8
Imperial Settlers is my favorite euro style game and deftly combines excellent card drafting and worker placement mechanics with asymmetric faction abilities, and varied and interesting player interaction mechanics. It is in an excellent looking game which provides for a thoroughly engaging experience at all player counts. 

Components: The artwork on the cards is really vibrant and beautiful. It really draws you to the game and encourages you to stay at the table, if only to see what all the different cards look like. The resources are represented by tokens that come in relevant shapes. The faction boards are also well illustrated and functional. 

Ease of learning/teaching: The core flow and mechanics of the game are fairly straightforward. The 3 different types of cards can be explained quickly, with the bulk of the mechanics explained on the cards themselves. A lot of questions crop up during play regarding building interactions which are not quite adequately explained in the rule book. However, a quick search through the BGG forums will usually solve that problem.

Theme: The game does justice to its theme. The different factions play differently, according to the historic proclivities of the corresponding empires. The different designs on the faction cards are lighthearted and fun. The style of interaction of each faction with other factions is also designed to play along the theme. 

Gameplay: The game is essentially about building a tableau of common and faction cards which are fueled by the resources that are produced in order to generate points. However, unlike other tableau builders where your engine is continually growing, in Imperial Settlers, your tableau evolves. One has to discard common locations in order to build most of the faction locations, so that what your engine produces or does is continually changing as you build new cards and moves you in a different direction.

Once you have your cards in hand, the game boils down to figuring out the correct sequence of actions so as to maximize the number of things you can do and the points you can generate in a turn. Player interaction ranges from destroying other factions' buildings to stealing their deals, or just appropriating usage rights for a turn. They are varied, tempered and never quite so rampant as to breed too much unnecessary hostility at the table. 

The game is somewhat intuitive in terms of tactical play but less intuitive when it comes to long term strategies. New players will feel hamstrung by inadequate production cards in early game and not focus on drawing enough cards. 

The solo variant of the game also provides a very engaging experience and was recently augmented with  campaign rules.

Imperial Settlers is one of those games where the whole is certainly greater than the sum of its parts. It always makes for a fulfilling time and gives you enough to think about without crippling you. I greatly look forward to fielding it every time.

Fairly generic enjoyable Euro engine-builder.  An improvement on 51st State's ideas, but still has problems.

Turn pacing/design has definite issues - the game requires it with the occasional targeted ability, but it mostly serves to heavily slow the game down.

Imperial Settlers is a good game, but not one of our favorites.  It seems like a game where it's pretty easy to get lost in your own little world unless you're really focused on razing your opponents buildings.  The faction to pick is VERY important as this will determine what goods you can store between turns and what goods you'll be earning early in the game.  (The factions do make sense thematically, which is a nice touch.)  This does mean you might have a different strategy every time you play, but also means you're more or less forced into a certain strategy.  Despite that, it doesn't feel extremely replayable.  You're basically just building buildings every game, hoping cards that benefit you come into your hand and trying to get the resources to build them once they do.  Not a bad game...but not one that jumps off the shelf onto the table on a regular basis.

Provisional rating, one 2p play at Essen (Romans vs Barbarians). A very enjoyable tactical, engine-building card game, with clear iconography and pleasant art. Minor concerns are: that some cards (e.g. Engineers) are very powerful but not costed accordingly, so if one is drawn in the early game could give that player a big advantage; that a multiplayer game might seem more "take that" as a result of players razing opponents' buildings; that there may not be strategies to pursue other than getting out the most buildings.

RATING: 6.5
Definitely an adorably attractive game with slick gameplay.  I'm just feels like it's missing heart to me.  It's over so quick, and there's less interaction than I'd like.  Feel-wise, Bruges gives you a similar sort of, "here's your hand for this round, make it work" feel, and setting up long-term combo's, but the push your luck elements and competing for goals brings it together more and adds some excitement that I feel is lacking in Imperial Settlers.

Granted, I do need to give it a few more plays.  I just don't typically enjoy card games where it feels like everyone is doing their own thing with a forced mechanism thrown on top for "interaction".  Dominion is lacking for the same reasons, for me.  

I like confrontation but with no real way to prevent it aside from picking one immune building each turn, it was really frustrating in this game. So it's a largely solo experience where people can throw monkey-wrenches in your engine. Eh...

Base game is great, built to be mean though.  This is not a friendly game at all.  Even the no attacking variant isn't nice and complicates a lot of the cards.  Also own why can't we be friends, Aztecs, and Atlantians.  None of the expansions are necessary and should only be bought if you like the game already.

Not a complex or heavy game which is reflected in the super light, cartoony artwork.

Some player interaction but not at all the "mean" game that some people seem to think it is. Makes me wonder what kind of games they play if they think this is mean.

Each turn (there are 5 in the game) increases in time exponentially from the turn before it. Downtime between players compounds which is super frustrating in light of each player taking ONE action. Not for me.

Luck-based production engine building euro. Very streamlined gameplay that doesn't require player aids or constant rulebook lookups. First game was a good game, drew cards that gave me a chance to focus my play and gain develop. Second game that was likely my last game was ruined by bad card draws during the first three rounds. The game suffers from random draws very much even if we played with a lookout phase draft variant. For example if you never draw any cards that allow you to gain more cards and at the same time never draw any more worker production cards your game will inevitably stall and there's nothing to do about it, recovering later in the game is too late as the engine base needs to be laid in the first three rounds. Couple this with another player who is doing well and can raze any new good building you build and we have a game that I will never touch again, even if it would sometimes work out well. House ruling away the randomness is an option but a game should not need house rules to be playable.

RATING: 8
Excellent game, I've barely tried New Era but definitely see the descendance, Imperial Settlers is a very streamlined game,it flows beautifully and there are almost no rule exceptions/starnge cases (contrary to Robinson Crusoe ^^). I would not class it as a familly game though, it's easy to pick and play but hard to perform well in it.

[+] like the art, great components, love the faction decks, streamlined gameplay, lots of options, seems well balanced
[-] a single card can be huge if you can get it (the red scoring for japanese, the black one for barbarian, etc.); why such a big box :(, takes a lot of table space

realy want/need to try:
- expansion: Done
- deck building: Done
- fan expansion
- solo mode: Done
- solo campaign: Done

2015 will see a lot of IS plays ^^

UP: solo campaign: I tried it with all factions, it works really well (fast paced, short game, lots of choices), but as it is now, it is really easy. The virtual opponent is no threat at all, the border faction taht provides a few cheap deals is a huge boost and the achievements are too cheap for the amazing bonus they provide. The only challenge comes from the provinces with increasing upkeep (resources each round) and control cost (-VP each game), but at least for 5-8 games, the achievements makes up for them and it was never challenging to win (most of the time scoring in the 80-100 range). Probably need some tweeks to be more challenging (in my opinion a good solo game should be a struggle to make you want to come back and beat it)

UP: after playing IS a lot (and it seems getting good at it), the game tends to get way longer when you know what your doing. maybe also because of the expansions? because good players make good decisions in early rounds, there is a snowball effect, where the rounds keep getting longer and longer. Focusing on card draw has been a best strategy to maximize points, but also increase play time. I've seen games where all faction buildings have been drawn during round 4. For most factions, the best strategies are to draw cards and wait until a combo can be played. All in all, I still like the game but I don't get it played any more because I know it will be very long... it's curious, usually getting better at a game decreases playtime, IS is the opposite. (+ there is no fun in playing against someone new to the game, who will be crushed by an experienced player)

Wasn't expecting too much from what looked like a generic euro VP gaining engine clone, but this title has more character, more replayability, and more interaction than it appears at first blush.  The faction differentiation is a nice touch, and the ability and necessity to raze other players' buildings adds a significant bite that is missing from a lot of Eurogames.  Imperial Settlers is a pretty dumb name, and the whimsical art sometimes rings a bit false, but I'm quite happy to play this anyway.

(Dec 2014 after 1 3p game) - Hmmm.   Interesting Euro with player interaction and some screwage with card play.  It does build up into lots of actions each round.  Was just trying to get the feel of things on this initial play and we messed up a rule where actions were being activated more than once (through the first 2-3 rounds) if there was no mention of a limit.    Tie for first and I lagged behind by 10ish.

Un juego que si bien me parece entretenido no me acaba de convencer. Esperaba mucho de él, pero a medida que hemos ido jugando he visto un par de defectos que aunque en otros juegos también aparecen, en este en conjunto han hecho que para mi se convierta en un juego prescindible. Uno es el azar de las cartas que puede hacer que tu partida se desarrolle como un tiro o que te cueste un mundo avanzar las primeras rondas. La segunda es la casi nula interacción entre los jugadores, que hace que en ocasiones ni levante la cabeza para ver que hace el rival. Se quedará, primero porque le gusta a mi mujer, y segundo porque aprovecharé el modo campaña cuando esté sólo y quiera jugar algún solitario (este de verdad)

Update 2017: Maybe not my most favorite game of all time, but it's among them. It holds up to multiple plays, but not quite as well as I was hoping. 

The feeling of building up for the first turn or two, then stretching your limited resources as far as they'll go, then finishing the last turn or two with a ton of resources and trying to squeeze every last VP out your civ as possible is exactly what I'm looking for in a resource management board game. 

After playing expansion 1, I love it! Open Production is an awesome addition and added a bit more player interaction as well. Atlanteans is next up... not sure how to feel about that radically different faction!
Update 2017: Atlanteans actually integrated a lot better than I expected them to! Good addition!

Update Q4 2017: Oh no. 51st State Master Set showed up and it MIGHT bump this off my best games of all time. Hmmm, time will tell.

Not at all what I thought it would be. Engine-building game with the same underlying mechanism as Seasons re: card drafting and resource collection via card abilities. Then there is the attacking/razing ability which is potentially interesting but expensive to use because you need to forgo resources to attack opponents. Basically, once you familiarize yourself with all the faction cards, you can figure out a winning strategy to rack up VP's. It seems unlikely anyone would win the game solely based on an attack strategy. Would play again.

This is a super cute resource management and engine building game. The factions feels different enough. Every turn is a puzzle where you try to maximize your output of the resources you have. The first few rounds are a slow build up, but near the end of the game your civilization is generating lots of resources as you try to squeeze every last VP out of it. This is a game I need to play more.

I can see that this is based on the main design of 51st State, and I really like 51st State, but I was a little let down by this game.  It doesn't feel like the same sort of game, despite having some of the same mechanisms, and I was a little put off by the different countries' start decks.  I can see that it makes the game ripe for expansions (which might be the reason it's done that way), but I think I would have to play out the original game with all its expansions before I could give this one the shot it probably deserves.

Just brilliant! No matter if it is played solo, with 2/3/4 players the game is excellent! It depends a lot on the production cards that you are going to get during the game (and how early you will get them), but your decisions as to how to handle your cards in your hand can really make the difference. It's very addictive, quick, clever and with the expansions you can get tons of replayability (even with the core game you will play it more than 30 times without getting bored!). A must try game! Thank you Ignacy for this diamond!

This is supposed to be a more streamlined version of 51st state. I'm sorry to see the original post-apocalyptic theme let go in favor of an ancient civilization skin, but it's not a deal breaker. I'm still not sure how I feel about the art direction, whether it's cute and whimsical or annoying. Mostly because it looks like something you'd see in a banner ad.

The game play is smooth. Draft a couple cards, activate some cards and build what you can. Between the community deck and the individual civilization decks, there are a lot of cool interactions that make every turn a new puzzle to work out. It's a nice marriage of drafting and CCG/TCG style combos.

I don't quite know what it is about this game that doesn't have me running back to it. After a couple of plays, it was well entertaining, and I'm quite fond of playing card games where cards have multiple uses which this champions immensely... but I think it's missing something crucial at its core, something essentially instinctive about how games like Race For The Galaxy or Uruk play. Sure, unfair comparisons, they're all quite different, but I think I'm expecting this title to jump out at me screaming [b]here is my clever, unique power![/b] and it's strange because it really is quite unique... but the feeling is off - flat, perhaps, maybe a little... unexciting? I don't know. I have to play it more but then I don't remember the rules - and for everyone's constant complaining about Race For The Galaxy and its iconography, I've not ever forgotten a single thing about it.

Thanks to the wonderfull artwork this is also a lot more accesible and yet it's not an easy game. A lot of depth and actually more streamlined then his so called predecessor.

Solid engine-building game with a beautiful graphic design. This is my go-to quick solo game (I play it almost exclusively in this variant). It still works great with 2 players, but adding more people only makes this game longer and more static. I definitely won't touch Imperial Settlers again with higher player count as it's just way too long for what it is, the game can last up to 2 hours with four players and there are way better games to pick from with such duration time.

This game is a lot of fun. First, you have a tableau building card game akin to Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy. You build different buildings that allow you to do generate resources, use those resources, and interact with your fellow gamers. Next, you have factions—similar to Netrunner—where those factions all play out a bit differently: the Egyptians are about generating gold and turning that into points, the Japanese want to generate long term points and protect their buildings, the Barbarians want to pillage and destroy, and the Romans want to build. 

I'm looking forward to playing more of this and I'm very curious to see what the expansions bring.

I like it. I had to watch a bunch of videos to help understand it more. It helped it a lot. The video they send you to from the instructions in the box sucks. Sound is low and he does not explain it well in my opinion.
It will take more plays to get better at playing it. A lot to keep track of in the later rounds. Once you learn the game better and the cards better it will play faster and have more fun. It never seamed like I was getting anywhere but in the end I won. Art work in great. After I play it more I will probably give it a higher rating.

This game has adorable art and components, which makes the interesting combination of card and resource management that much more enticing. The existence of a peaceful variant means that it is likely to get played with much greater frequency among my friends, and the fact that it can be played solo boosts its chances of hitting the table even when I can't get a group together. I only wish the box were more portable.

I had high hopes for this game. The reviews were very positive and it had generated a good amount of hype. When I finally sat down to play I was expecting to be treated to a deep and entertaining game with asymmetrical factions and interesting decisions.  This wasn't the case.  Too many choices seemed overtly mechanical and weren't fun. 

I feel the game would improve vastly if the scoring were "race" like, with the winner being the first to cross a scoring line.  This would solve much of my problems with the mechanical feel as racing games can get away with the thinly covered scoring mechanics present in this game.

I doubt I will ever play this again and that makes me sad because I otherwise love the designer.

Interactive civ builder. Barbarians, Egyptians, Japanese and Romans race to build or raze locations (yours or theirs), make deals, or play actions. Most cards are played to your own player board from your unique faction deck or from drafted common cards.  The key is to take advantage of the unique strength of your faction deck. Build resource and power upgrades while fending off attacks from opponents. Pig pile on runaway leaders. Some factions are more aggressive and some have strengths that are more subtle.

RATING: 5
1 play, base game with Romans and Barbarians.

Suffers from way too much equivalence of actions leading to lack of meaningful and interesting decisions.  The AP prone will perish staring at cards with ten ways to spend two resources to get the same result.

There is no differentiation between resources which makes the build flexible, balanced, and also broken and *boring af*.  Play best available, consume what you produce, /game.

Also this game takes way too long for what it is/does.  Race For the Galaxy is vastly superior engine building and plays through quicker with more interesting decisions, better art and more fun.

Sorry if this sounds bitter, I tend to be a little harsh on over-hyped games that under deliver.

Really enjoying this so far! I love how different each deck feels and the combos you get to make.

This is easily one of my favorite games. I played 51st State first, so I'm unable to decide which one I like better, but I think they are different enough to own both.

Imperial Settlers is a simpler game than 51st State, but having two decks to choose from definitely makes this a compelling game. Highly recommend.

I like the way this game works. The multi-use cards are interesting and having production and the ability to make deals helps prevent super slow starts. Each faction also plays pretty differently, but because of that it's definitely a game you need to play a few times to get a feel for specific factions as the strategy may not be apparent at first. The components are nice and even the cards feel good and sturdy. The game doesn't necessarily drag with 4 but takes a pretty substantial amount of time. I would probably stick to 2-3 players because of this.

RATING: 7.5
I've played Imperial Settlers a number of times now and it has become more enjoyable with every play. It is important that you play up to the strengths of your particular faction as using the same strategy for one group won't necessarily work for another. This is where multiple plays becomes important as, not only do you gain a better understanding of how your own faction plays and when it's the most opportune time to play certain cards, but you also have a better understanding about how your opponents play and what you need to do to thwart their plans.

Don't let the 'cute' graphics fool you, there's quite a bit of interaction in the game, which is good... and in most cases... necessary.

I also really enjoy how the cards can be used in multiple ways. Do you want to build it for its ability? Can you not afford it and instead want to turn it in to a deal? Is it better for you to raze the card from your hand so that you can use the resources to undertake a better move on your next turn? Is everything that I just struggled to do about to get destroyed by my opponent?

While I've played this with all player counts, and I think that it works well with them all, I think that it really shines as a three player game. From what I've heard, the first expansion also seems to really add more friendly interaction in the game as the only interaction in the based game was generally destroying your opponents building.

And speaking of expansions... the game is designed for expansions and I'm already interested in picking them up as the come out. Given the mechanically sound nature of the game and its seemingly endless expand-ability options, I don't think that I'll grow tired of this game any time soon.

-- UPDATE --

While my comments above (2015) seem to love the idea of expansions, my current self has actually cooled on the game due to expansions. What was an easy to pick up game has all now become something that requires deck-building and additional time commitments. This is not what I had originally hoped for. (See comment on Atlantean's expansion)

RATING: 8
A 2-4 player card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.

RATING: 7.5
Played several solo games, not too hard but I love games that have a single player mode. Played Rome vs Egypt, soft version (without razing opponents buildings). Next time we'll definitely go bashing each other. I like this game with 2 players a lot. I think though it has quite a bit of potential for AP, so I am guessing it can end horribly boring with more than 2 players as you wait for the others to optimize their actions.

RATING: 6
Some nice VP scoring mechanics and player actions....BUT too much luck too many things to try to look at in your and your foes tabloes.  So take it or leave it, the art and theme + faction powers makes it feel like a PC RTS game (which is a great thing!)

6 after 1 play.

Excellent artwork and very good quality components. However, gameplay is average and player interaction is very low. The nature of the factions also encourages a particular play style, which may reduce replayability.

RATING: 7
Picked this up on a whim and I'm really glad that I did. I really like the art and graphic design in this game and I had a good time playing it. I've focused solely on improving my game as the Romans and after some low scores to start I think I understand how to do well with them now. Most of my plays have been the solo game.

Solo game scores (core rules and cards *= WCWBF card(s) included):

Romans  41, 38, 49, 52, 55, 127, 103, 131, 101, 134, 130*, 185*

Egyptians: 101, 48, 101*, 40*, 56*, 96*, 46*, 101*

It's been a while since this hit the table. I've played it enough to beat most people that want to try it and I win in such a way that it makes me feel filthy. This is solo only at the moment and I don't play solo often. I'd consider a trade.

Got tired of this game, solo play lost its lustre and games with more than one were overly long, bogged down and dull.

Have only played pacifism mode, the game is far too long for what it offers - specifically the last round often taking what feels like an age, without many meaningful choices to make. Mostly just "running" your tableau. 

Suspect pacifism may be the reason for this. Would only play again in the 'full' mode.

Has some interesting card play and ways to make compos between the cards.

The one thing that I didn't like was waiting for other player when I had passed - sometimes multible rounds. This happened too often for my taste.

Also I tend to not be so fond of games there your opponents has a lot of cards with a lot of text on them in front then.

The game is very nice, but I fell like I hardly can follow what's going on in my opponent's village. Therefore, I find difficult to be able to select a good strategy to stop other players and I focus only on my own empire.
Nevertheless, the game is good, easy to play and rewarding.

[after 1 game (1@1p)]
Got the gist of the game by playing solo Romans, and I might had a glimpse of why people said the game is unbalanced. Steamrolled the game, got VERY close to the 80+ point threshold.
I've found it an interesting resource management exercise, promising game.


[after 2 games (1@4p,1@1p)]
First multiplayer game with full rig of opponents, all new players. I try to avoid picking the Romans, the others insist on not choosing them (especially when I tell them about their reputation, I guess nobody wants to incur in the risk of being "the one who won just because of an unfair advantage"), so I end up playing them again.
Got two small rules wrong that probably didn't have a huge impact (i.e. the 1 wood compensation for being razed and the possibility of spending more resource to activate one action multiple times in a turn).
Romans steam-rolled the opponents after a very slow point start. By the looks of it, the Egyptian player played enough to the faction strengths, the Barbarian had some bad luck on his own faction cards (no production buildings at all until the last round), and the Japanese player - after an early lead in points - got simply stuck without being able to play on its strengths (had piles and piles of unused food and very few buildings).

I think that Romans really have it easy at this point. Once they manage to get out one or two of their buildings that reward them for building GREY and ROMAN buildings, they just start the engine at full throttle. Maybe I haven't seen the full picture, but they seem to be very very focused in what they do: produce stone, build point-generating buildings for faction and grey buildings, start building non-stop. Additional points come from action buildings that let you spend stone, and the additional raze tokens you can stack allows you to get extra points/resources and mess a bit of the opponents plans.
The only critical aspect is making sure that by the time you start the building chain you have the drawing capabilities to sustain it.
Problem is, you don't really depend on anybody or anything out-of-faction to accomplish this strategy, as most stuff you have it in-house. Except some early stone-generating buildings, the common cards you want are the ones which are cheaper to spend as foundations (and of course the ones that let you draw, which you should defend promptly).

I've read a very interesting and comprehensive piece by "PinkMeeple" about the game, and I do disagree with the statement that drawing cards is not the most important thing in this game, especially for the Romans, here's why:
- production cards usually pay for themselves (i.e. you get back what you spend right away), so... why not? Worst case you have a foundation to use on a better faction card right away... but you have to have the card in hand of course!
- common cards can be razed cheaply and gain you immediate resources: more often than not, I felt like I would have razed only my cards all day if only I had more in my hand, why spend more to get potentially the same and just give minor hassle to the opponent (remember that production buildings pay for themselves, so razing those usually is almost beneficial for the opponent unless it is a very valuable one);
- faction cards can be used to make deals, which generate resources cheaply and cannot be razed (although the Japanese can screw you on that), but you need to draw excess faction cards in order to have the "luxury" of using them as deals.

All in all, card draw is a very crucial way to enact production (raze and deals). Producing a lot of resources allows you to realise any strategy really, but you need - again - cards to make the best use out of them. At the beginning I'm more than happy to draw common production cards as they mostly pay for themselves and grant me at least an extra resource next round (or this one, if they get razed), if I happen to draw an action or feature card I'm not interested in, it's raze-fodder for more resources. The first two turns may be tough as you don't have the required flexibility and optimisation is tricky, but the more you go onward the more you become flexible... IF you have a strong card draw.

I want to play again with a different faction. My biggest fear right now is that most factions are one-dimensional enough to require expansions to keep the game any interesting.

[after 3 games (1@4p,1@3p,1@1p)]
Managed to play another game with 3, same group as last game but one less guy. This time we didn't take the Romans, but from my perspective the outcome was the same, and I think I actually got more points than in my last game playing the Japanese.
It has to be said that the girl playing the Barbarian did a couple of mistakes early on that completely ruined her game, and since the other guy was playing the Egyptians he was not really interested in messing up with me by razing etc.
I can see how in this base game each faction has sort of a couple of ways to do its thing, or at least a couple of aspects it excels at to increase its resource curve and then gather points.

All in all the Japanese were more fun to play compared to the Romans I think, and they have some really powerful special cards.
However I didn't substantially change my strategy in this game, as I have focused heavily on faction buildings. It just required different resources and different side-actions to increase the benefits of my strategy. Daimyo Castles helped quite a bit, and compared to the Romans I had many more cards that I struggled to use as deals because I really wanted to see built.

At the level of interaction that we've been floating around right now, I'd say that Imperial Settlers is very much a multiplayer solitaire, but a very good solitaire nonetheless.
Occasionally the fear of raze tokens does force you to consider your opponents, but on the other hand judging when the opponents are going to pass can affect your play if you are the one who wants to raze something.

I'm assessing a tentative "8" for now, but it has potential to fluctuate around that. Given my history with most games, the fourth game is kind of revealing: if it survives the fourth play with stable or increasing marks, then it's definitely a keeper and I'll probably consider buying expansions to increase variety.

[after 4 games (2@4p,1@3p,1@1p)]
Played a fourth game after a while, this time I used the Egyptian but still the same outcome: I won by a very large margin with more than 110 points. I guess I'm lucky and good enough at the game while the people I've been playing with are consistently worse... dunno.

In this game we had two new players and one who was at her third game (she came in last though, and with the Romans... the irony!).

I'm decreasing the score of this because the heaviness of the "solitaire" aspect for me, combined with the length of the game that we've been experiencing, is too much. I feel like I'm playing a 3 hours long Race for the Galaxy: I love race, but I love it also because it's meaty decisions and combos in a short amount of time.
Another game that I feel somewhat relates to this for me is another favorite of mine: Seasons. In my experience they are comparable in length, but the much higher level of interaction provided by Seasons and the very structure of the turn and timing elevate it to a much superior level compared to Imperial Settlers. One thing that I thought I could do without in Seasons is fiddlyness, but Imperial Settlers is even worse at this with all its beautiful yet numerous resource tokens that you are constantly spending and gaining.

Long story short: I feel two games that I have in my collection fill the same niche of this in a better way (Race being faster, Seasons being more tense and satisfying).
I still think it's a very nice game that will appeal to those who like low interaction (although to such people even the raze mechanism could be annoying) and don't like the space theme of race and the symbols.
Another game that I own that relates to this in my book is San Juan (makes sense since I compared this to Race): again, to me it feels very similar to Imperial Settlers with a simplified resource system.
I'm not trading it for now, but I'm not pursuing expansions. Would play if asked, but wouldn't probably propose it often myself.

[after 5 games (2@4p,2@3p,1@1p)]
Nothing new here, picked it up after a while and played the Barbarians (first time for me) against Romans and Egyptian: another win, although this was a bit closer than previous games.
I stand by my previous conclusions: in 3 it took us roughly 2 hours to finish a game. A bit too long for what it is, and I still find annoying the juggling of resources.

Man, this is such a cute little civilization builder. I've only played solo mode, which I fear is much different than the multiplayer I intend to play this weekend, but it's pretty solid. Five rounds makes it super short, and really forces you to make the best decisions and chain building abilities together. I've played against the AI twice: I lost the first one because I only half-read the rules and couldn't possibly win, and then I beat the pants off it.

Jól összerakott játék, könnyen érthető (magyar) szabállyal, szép színes, jó grafikájú kártyákkal. A tablóépítés miatt nálam előnnyel indult, de aztán tényleg rászolgált a nevére. Jók a kombók, jó ötlet a rombolás, néha ugyan erős a pasziánsz érzés, de ettől függetlenül simán polcon a helye, mert nagyon élvezetes.

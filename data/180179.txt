An inoffensive and unremarkable game of set collecting which gets old by the time you've finished your first game. That's not to say you can just wing it: you do need to be a bit on the lookout as to hope and try to force open particular cards creating larger sets which see spirits move into your possession. But that's all you do. There are better games to be had, using less table space too for that matter.

A fun little, simple, pretty and quick game.

= A good light card game

Nice easy light abstract set collection card game
Sometimes hard to differentiate the target cards
although we liked the understated design
(Hadn't heard of this one and came across it
in a Con library.)

RATING: 4
Still now only a "4"...,
 the card colours from the "ghosts" and the related playing cards are not matching... look at the white ghost... it makes to keep an overview during the game really hard... you have to look now especially the "tiny" symbols on the card.
Not really playerfriendly.

As two player this becomes really boring..., no real challenge without at least a third person interacting (or better 4). Everybody tries fast and easy to secure "his" three ghosts and then who is getting the remaining "fourth" to win this before the cards all gone... my high expectation as a fast and easy two player card game were not matched. Bad.

Will giv'em at least a change with four player soon before I give my "final" rating...
I'm still hope.

OK filler. Setup is a pain, and the game is quite random and ends abruptly, but the art is great. Can handle a playthrough now and then.

Very playable with 3 or 4 players. Haven't tested it yet in a 2-player game.
Rules are easy, the cards are really beautiful. And it's a small game, so I can take it with me wherever I go !

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This worked well two player and the artwork is quite nice. You basically are pulling cards from the tableau that are fully showing and not blocked to build sets to take over the spirit cards. Capture enough spirits to win. Two different ways to build sets - either the symbol or the number.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Unique game of collecting cards via sets of the same number, or sets of the same suit, to capture special spirt cards (one spirit card per suit). There are different landscape configurations for set-up, which is nice, as you have many of the cards face down, only revealed once the cards on top are claimed. The artist did a good job. The cards are nice to look at while playing. Enjoyed playing this at 2-player. The box says it plays 1 to 4-player. Not sure I would want to have more than 3 though.

A decent hand management set collection game with a focus on negative player interactions (stealing sets from each other).

Interesting and neat scoring mechanism and stealing mechanism, and a fun card-unveiling mechanism (overlapping cards).

Really beautiful artwork.

What appears at first to be a simple set collection card game turns out to have some hidden depths where card selection becomes important in order to steal Spirits from other players.

Typical Kickstarter-flop, the type of game that made I stopped backing on Kickstarter if it concerns publishing houses who haven't proven they are worthy of backing yet. Luckily I'm not the owner of this game and haven't paid 20 euro for it :-)

I've played the solo game and also 4 player and honestly I think this might be best with three players. With 4 it is too easy to start a set to capture a spirit and so there never felt like there was any tension in the game. I'm eager to try it with three players.

Neat little game with beautiful art and very open for both experienced players who just want something simple and short to play while enjoying cup of tea or coffee or new players who can jump right into the game and enjoy themselves.

I was excited about this one and enjoy a game that comes straight out of a deck like this but offers something different. Unfortunately the play unexciting and very difficult to actually feel engaged in. Didn't feel like there was much room for clever plays and the game doesn't build in a real fashion, just stops when the cards run out.

The art is very nice, but could be more functional.

(own by ale from Essen 2015).
Simple and quick card game. It's a good 2-player filler. The artwork is nice and the quality of the cards is OK. From a certain point of view, it can be seen like a 2-player version of the Solitaire (or Mahjong) game for pc.

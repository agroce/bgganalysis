*7* (Initial plays)
The graphic design of the cards could be better and the font on the cards is too small, but there's a good amount of card variety. The gameplay seemed good on initial plays. It plays in a good amount of time and will likely be play well with 3-5 players. I would definitely like to play it more with other card combinations.

A hidden Gem, in my opinion, 4 player perfection, and a plethora of qualities that I like in a good tame.  

Extremely low complexity makes it easy to understand, but emergent properties give it high replayability and the ability to discover new unforseen interactions. 

Simultaneous play means very little time is spent waiting for other players to complete their turns, games can proceed quickly.  Players start with almost the same set of cards, introducing some randomness but also making it feel like a fairly balanced start.  
 
There is more than one way to win, but it usually involves being unpredictable enough to your opponents while correctly predicting their moves.

I can't see playing this over and over. It works ok as a filler, but the clash mechanic is more annoying than the main effect is fun. There is never really enough information to make a good play until you are lucky at the end and everyone's options are limited. 

The red-on-black Clash effect text is not good graphic design.

I don't regret buying it, but wouldn't recommend it.

Battlecruisers is the great game of cosmic rock, scissors, paper... to be fair, there is a fair bit more to it than that.

In a game each player is assigned the same set of cards, the number of cards is 3 more than the number of players, however one card starts in the discard pile and another starts in the recovery zone.  If you play the same card as someone else, bad things happen; as you can see, we're running out of room for error!  Based on the cards you can see, the cards that have been played and the cards in recovery zones (which are visible), you are trying to execute a strategy while being a little different.  Each card offers a different carrot; victory points, protection, discards, steal and a bunch of other abilities.  The objective, be the first to 15 victory points or the last player standing with cards in their hand.

Battlecruisers has an exceptionally noteworthy level of replayability.  There are 21 player deck recipes listed in the rules and that's before you make your own, for which there are recommended guidelines to get the best experience.  While some of the recipes are similar, others require different strategies for optimal play.

Players take matching decks of 4-6? 6-8? cards and then use them for their abilities either trying to be the first to 15 points or the last player standing.

Battlecruisers is a fun little filler that has high replayability due to the combinations of different decks that can be used. Not sure I need to own it but happy that it is available at the DL.

Plays quickly enough to be palatable to non-gamers and offset swings in luck. The variable setup lends the game lots of replayability.

Battlecruisers is a confrontational type card game set in the Eminent Domain universe which basically just means that it re-uses some of the art. The game plays very quickly and is the type of game you'd play 2-3 times in a row using different cards. The bluffing/deduction aspect lies in guessing which cards other players won't play and avoid penalties.

Totally unimpressed. While there may be a lot of variety in the game due to using different cards each time you play, I can't say I'm all that interested in giving other card combos a try.

I really love this style of game, of trying to get into the head of the other players and try to figure out what they will be playing and trying to outsmart them.

That pretty much sold the game to me and it has the plus of being a much much faster game than Libertalia, this can be a filler game, depending on the setup of the cards, and there are a lot of different recommended setups and you can even do your own setups or just randomly select a few cards! So, the replay-ability of this one is through the roof!

I feel like there's a good game somewhere in here, but I'm not sure I want to spend the time trying out all the different combinations to find it. I like that this is basically a hard-and-fast version of Libertalia, but the game goes along so quickly that if you blink, you'll miss it. When you're eliminated it feels kind of cheap, despite the fact that it makes sense with the theme. I just wish that you were slinging damage instead of running out of cards while collecting VPs. Not a terrible game, but not a wholly enjoyable one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In this filler card game, everyone starts with an identical set of 7 cards. One is discarded, and one is put face up into your resource pile. Everyone secretly selects a card to play, and the card will go into your resource pile, the card in your resource pile returns to your hand. The trick is that if multiple people play the same card, you "clash" and generally bad things happen, like losing VPs or losing cards.  You win by getting to 15 VPs or everyone else runs out of cards to play. When you are down to one playable card, you enter the red alert phase which allows you to play the card over and over again.

There is some double thinking going on, a good deal of luck if your cards clash or if you get targetted by someone else. It's fun to end a gaming session with a quick game, as they last about 15 minutes. I think you try to survive the rapid fire and see if you are the last person standing!

I love Eminent Domain and since this uses the theme I wanted to try it out. I enjoyed it, but wasn't blown away by it. It is a game though, that if it didn't have such a time of sorting cards in the beginning, that I could see as a solid filler in our group.

First the players agree on which set of cards will be used this game a la Dominion. And then play simultaneous revelation rounds repetitively until someone wins or is the last one standing. Each card gives you its bonus if you're the only one to reveal it this round (usually VPs, or something similarly good) and a different effect if someone else revealed it as well (less good, might even be bad). The potential variety caused by the game sets is an obvious plus. The game play itself is pedestrian - reveal, resolve, repeat. You'll do better if you can concentrate on what other players can't play this turn (due to discards, etc). The big downside is the RIDICULOUS font size for the card effects - bring out the magnifying glasses - for cards that have plenty of space and could have been designed well, and then the STUPID decision to use red ink on a black background to magnify the mistake. It detracted from our enjoyment enough to bin it despite any potential it may have.

Players each control a battlecruiser.  To win the game, you must either acquire 15 victory points or be the last player remaining.

Each player has a deck of cards of which only 6 to 8 cards are used.  All players will use the same set of cards for each game.  Each card has a number which indicate the order in which its effect activates and an effect.  Each turn, all players choose a card to play and lay it face down.  Then everyone reveals the cards.  Cards take effect in order of the number.  If only one player reveals a particular card, the main effect happens.  If two or more players reveal the same card, there is a clash and the clash effect (detrimental to the players playing the card) takes effect.

Any card played will remain the recovery zone and cannot be played for one turn.  Then the next turn occurs and players play another card like before.  There is a discard pile where players put their cards if they are forced to discard.  When a player has to discard all of his cards, he is knocked out.

Very good filler game. Has large selection of cards. It allows you to customize the identical player decks by mixing and matching the different cards types (in a similar manner to deckbuilder card market selections). This gives you a ton of replay value since there are over 30 different card types in the box for you to mix and match.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Reminds me, oddly enough, of a combination of Coup and King of Tokyo. Everyone starts with the same hand of cards. Play is face-down and simultaneous. If you play a unique card, you gain a bonus. If not, then you clash with the other player(s) who used the same card. There are two ways to win: victory points or running everyone else out of cards, and therefore out of the game. In other words, you build or attack.

It's a quick game with some interesting surprises. That there is variety in the form of your starting hands helps replayability and keeps things interesting. I wouldn't say this is as fun as other titles in the same filler genre, but it comes close. Overall, a solid title and one I'd gladly play if someone suggested it.

Culled - First wave; Comics Place contribution

Why we culled it: I believe I acquired this as an add-on for an EmDo expansion KS campaign. I LOVE Eminent Domain, so I was originally intrigued to see another offering set in the same universe. The game itself is a card-based starship battle in which players have a deck of similar (identical?) cards with various starship actions, each ranked by an initiative value - stronger effects play later, etc. The game is rated to play from 3-5 players, which was the downfall for us. I can honestly think of no situation where I have acess to three players and we'd prefer to play this over EmDo itself, let alone all of the other 3+p games. A cool thing to see the IP expand, but this particular outlet wasn't for us. On to a better home.

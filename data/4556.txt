A decent solitaire experience with some tedious record-keeping. Still, the experience is captivating, and more than once, I was hoping to NOT see a tank -- which, when appearing close to the end of my mission completely took me out of the game.

Thankfully, all crew survived the encounter with one minor injury -- surprisingly.

This will see the table again, certainly.

Solitaire game along the lines of B-17 that puts you in the commanders roll in a Sherman tank. Interesting system that offers more detail and choice over what B-17 provides. In this game you actually get to make some good decisions. But in the end your just rolling dice and looking at tables anyway with a few choices thrown in. Not overly complicated but this is an old school hex n counter game so don't expect to breeze through the rules.

RATING: 6
The same designer as B-17. It does not feel like a simulation in the way B-17, The Hunters, Picket Duty and B-29 do. You got a lot more decisions to make. You move your tank on two different maps, scout areas, order artillery and air strikes, maneuver in combat, select ammunition and targets, lead your men. It is a little like the stuff Dan Verssen does with his leader series today, only focused on one unit and not a whole group. The game has that special AH/VG feel in it's components and rules. Well, if you started wargaming back in the time of the classic giants you know what i mean.

Old collection.

The individual battles are quite fun, shooting up enemy tanks, guns, and wagons.

Although not one I&#039;ll play again, I think this was the second-best solitaire wargame AH produced, after the top-flight Ambush!. Sometimes neat tactical problems, and really gave a feel of the decisions a tank commander made (to the extent a game can anyway). Head and shoulders above B-17, but somehow it never captured the imagination of gamers that (to me rather tedious) game did.

The second solitaire game I bought.  This got a lot of play during my summers off in college.  Found it difficult though as my tanks kept getting whacked a lot.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Certainly the mapboard is not attractive to a wargamerâ€™s eye; nor the counters. The rulebook should have been re-written; always going back and forth to find a specific exception or sub-paragraph to sort out oneâ€™s queries â€“ a mess in short. By patience and AH wargaming experience one should go step by step and play a couple of turns just to find out the mechanics of play. Then all game play flows smoothly. 

As the rules book states, this solitaire game recreates the limited perspective of the battlefield that a tank commander would have had and has managed to give you exactly this feeling. 

All the abstract situations are achieved by plenty of dice rolls on tables and player aids. You peak up the type of tank, your crew with ratings and your scenario. You will never have a clear knowledge of what goes on just adjacent to your area, you will never have a view of all the battlefield and you will never know where all the enemy units are located in reference to your position. You will only see just what can only be seen around your tank. You will confront light enemy units like MG, half-tracks or squads to heavy targets like STUG IIIg and Marder to an unpleasant Tiger. You will often witness an area being secured just by friendly fire (your own task force, artillery support or airstrike). 

The game gives you the option of commanding each member of your tank crew according to the situation. You can have an open hatch to spot enemy units, fire the main gun, repair a malfunctioning MG, place smoke, repair a thrown track, train your crew for the gyroscopic stabilizer of your main gun, refit and all that can possibly occur by manning a tank on a chaotic battlefield! It is amazing what the designers of this solitaire wargame have managed to achieve. 

The GENERAL issues can throw you more light on game mechanics and provide you with alternatives like using a German tank on the Russian Front or a Soviet tank on your way towards Berlin. Endless situations and variations. You can choose a scenario if you have no spare time or a whole campaign if you have plenty of free time to experiment with unlimited battlefield situations.

I liked B-17: Queen of the Skies and RAF, two other solitaire war games.  Alas, Patton's Best just never clicked for me.  I think it was just a tad more complicated than I liked, and I never got through the learning curve.  Traded away in February 2015 for Upon A Salty Ocean and El Caballero....

A fairly detailed (at least in terms of armor penetration and so forth) simulation and, unlike B-17 where you're just along for the ride, you feel in control of your fate.  As such, it has a good paper time machine feel: you fear every panzer and anti-tank gun that pops up; you can't stay buttoned up as being blind means being dead; every advancement in tank technology has a small but possibly crucial part to your survival (wet stowage!).  Plus, playing the campaign game, you come to care for your paper soldiers, and every wound and death becomes personal... especially if the green replacement flubbs a roll that leads to the death of the rest of the crew.  I've never gotten a man all the way through the war.  The main problem with the game is that the combats get repetitive, and your best chance of survival is often to bypass the enemy completely.

One of those classic games that really delivers on its hype, the game mechanic isn't all too modern and definitely to do with some fleshing out, but what is there works and I love playing the campaign.  On the whole this game is on par with B-17 for me (these games are different, but from the same era of offline gaming), this one has more choices, is a little more involved and fits a certain mood better, but B-17 is good to pick up when I need a break from thinking.  Highly recommended, worth the effort of buying and learning and rewards that in excess to your effort.

RATING: 3
Scores well for simulation -- if you want to drive a tank, load the ammo, and maneuver for a shot, then this is the game for you. Unfortunatley, because the game simulates being part of a larger formation, you'll often find events are out of your hands, as abstractly-represented "friendly forces" take out your target just as you were lining up your shot. I liked all the little tanky details, but realizing that the friendly forces table and the random event roll had as much (or more) to do with my success than the decisions I made put a damper on the game for me. Missions can also be quite long ... long enough for me to become bored with hand cranking this paper computer, and decide to put the whole thing back in the box.

Recently re-aquired this game after owning it many years ago. Originally didn't really take to it. I had B17 and was excited about the prospect of being able to do good stuff fighting in a tank in Europe. Never really got into the game. I never seemed to be able to kill anything and yet my task group was always killing stuff....felt very boring and was not great fun!

I now see it differently especially after reading the articles in the General and I think I was possibly unaware of some of the rules and just mis-interpreted some of them. My recent plays have been fun and exciting and the idea of getting the crew through the campaign is much more appealing now over the general desire to blow stuff up all the time.... not that I have passed up on a cheeky shot or two at the odd Panther or AT when the moment is right!

There is a lot in this game and it is certainly very,very immersive, It is a little rules heavy and more so that B17 but, I think on balance I am enjoying Patton's Best more than B17...time will tell.

Playing in the 4th Armoured Divison BGG Community game this year and it has been great fun indeed.

2nd August 1944  Sherman M4A1 'Bolton Bull' Advance Scenario part of Campaign survives with 2 exits achieved and a truck and LW team as credited kills.

4th August 1944 Sherman M4A1 'Bolton Bull' Advance Scenario part of Campaign survives initial action but day ends early due to being demobilised losing track in a mine field. Tank and crew otherwise fine. No exits achieved and no credited kills claimed.

7th August 1944 Sherman M4A1 'Bolton Bull' Advance Scenario part of Campaign survives initial action but day ends early due to main gun being broken in an intense engagement. Tank and crew otherwise fine. No exits achieved and no credited kills claimed.

12th August 1944 Sherman M4A1 'Bolton Bull' Advance Scenario part of Campaign Very near miss today as 'Bolton Bull' is hit in the turret from an anti-tank gun shot, round penetrates and knocks out 'Bolton Bull' but fortunately there is no explosion and the crew are all able to exit the tank without loss other than some light wounds. The tank brews up but all crew are safe! No exits achieved and no credited kills claimed.

This is way too complex for a solitaire game, and unnecessarily so. The concept is too abstract and the rulebook is a mess to read with every bit well-intended decipherment. I am not sure how one can manage to game. Virtually it is an individual tank simulation game under the disguise of General Patton. I wonder the use of the name is a marketing strategy for an otherwise overly-complex, dull and mechanic game. A typical example of doing more for less.  Sold in an auction for US$8.

Very good game of solitaire tank-to-tank combat in the Second World War
While I prefer its more exciting (but less complicated) predecessor, B-17: Queen of the Skies, it still possesses much of the same excitement, and it adds King Tigers!

Works OK, and not all dumb luck - however, it does demonstrate that sometimes you simply [i]will[/i] be blown away no matter what you do.  The overgame works fairly well, too; one is aware that high intensity combat is not the norm, mand when you get through those days you can breathe easier.

Great solitaire game for playing with a partner who can share the bookwork - almost every action requires reference to multiple die roll modifier tables. Really feels like you are with your crew is in tank combat (that from someone who has been in neither).

I've played this twice, so two of the After Action Reports have been filled in, but the rest of the game is as new. Some scuffing to the box as a result of its age, but only cosmetic. All components have been punched but are sorted and bagged up, and all of the components are in as new condition. I look after all my games, and considering this one is getting on for thirty years old, it's in very good shape.

As at 14 Jan 2014, pictures can be found on my marketplace listing for this game.

I really like the idea of this game. It is very hard to pick up from the limited rule book, however. I feel that subsequent attempts will improve my rating. Want to use the random generators in this game to apply to Memoir 44 game.  Somehow use this to generate solo scenarios.

Lots of charts to flick through.  And can take a while to get the 'flow' of the game.  But once it's up and running there is a lot of fun to be had.  Not a bad solitaire simulation of controlling a tank in the European theatre in WWII.

RATING: 4
A very dicey and dull game of being a Sherman tanker. Like many solo games it suffers from being very deadly to the player but without enough tactical options that the player can reduce the chance of being killed. It felt very much as if the house always won, as you required an incredible streak of luck to survive long.

RATING: 7
Hard to compare to anything out there since not many solitaire games available. Designed for campaign play which is well done as you get improvements in your crew, tank, etc and can lose veteran crew members. Rules apparently complex, but turn are summarized on the board. Good for snowy weekends when alone at home. Biggest gripe is the mechanic in which every unidentified tank is a Tiger and every unidentified gun is an 88. This was done to recreate the fog of war, but results in lethal ambushes that can be devastating if you don't identify the gun quickly and don't seem terribly realistic.

RATING: 7
A fun game in which you control a tank and its operators selecting each person's actions for the turn. The board is nice and functional having a variety of tables and references printed onto it. Some portions of the game I found harder to understand and could have used clarifications and sample of play scenarios. You have a large variety of tanks to use throughout your campaign as you travel deeper into Europe. The game has a lot more decisions, but still feels somewhat like a simulation like B-17, B-29, and The Hunters. The biggest complaint against the game is it can be hard for some people to accept that a non identified vehicle packs the same punch as the largest guns possible.

Somehow expected more from this game; it's much in the same genre as B-17. Your tank just sits there and things appear around the edges of the board to cause trouble. The research piece is outstanding, and the tank cards are excellent. I must not have had the imagination for this one.

2/19/06: Impression after three plays (two single battles, one scenario): Quite an interesting attempt at a solitaire tank-game. It tries very hard to simulate combat of a big force of which the player is only a small part. The problem with this is two-fold: First, the friendly forces are not visible on the board. You are all alone with the enemy and the friendlies are just simulated by a table to roll on. Second, resulting from this you donÂ´t really play such a big role in the game. For example: My second game was just a small advance-scenario. I encountered an enemy tank and MG-team. We enter the Battlefield, lay down advancing fire for no effect and are surprised by an enemy ambush. Both enemy units move, the enemy tank draws flanking fire from the US-forces and is destroyed. Now itÂ´s my turn - I spot the MG-team and fire the main gun and the bow-mg at it...but without effect. During the enemies turn the MG fires without result at friendly infantry and makes it unscathed through the friendly action-phase. So, last phase of turn 1: I roll on the random event table. I roll friendly artillery which eliminates the MG-Team. Game over, mission accomplished.
Still, this game is interesting and worth exploring. But your decisions are not necessarily going to effect the game very much. Sometimes you will feel that you are just a spectator or victim to the whims of chance. Both very realistic to be sure but not necessarily a very rewarding game experience.

Good solitaire game definately worth playing for anybody interested in subject matter. Rules are not long, but have a few spots that could be more complete.The best part of the game is the RPG element and the campaign game, trying to survive in your tank while fighting across France and into Germany. 

The only real problem with the game is that it can get repetitive after awhile because of its abstract nature, ie., killing the enemy is not based on manuever, using terrain in a traditional sense or a combination of units. It's prtetty much if you're within range roll the dice and check the modifiers. And if if you don't make the kill there's a good chance your invisible task force can get the kill with one roll of the dice. 

Like B17 the game creates a fun narrative.

This is the best solitaire wargame that I've played.  That's not exactly quite as high of praise as it sounds, as I can count the number I've tried on one hand, but it may mean something to some people that I consider it better than such notables as [gameid=1608] and [gameid=28829].  There's a lot of rules to internalize on the first play, but I found that by the second play, I was already internalizing the more complex situations without having to double check everything.  There's a nice tension, as you have a legitimate chance of getting killed whenever you run into an antitank gun or panzer, and you better hope that your squad makes it out.  It's a very interesting abstraction of what a tank commander would have to deal with.  There's even a campaign option for the truly dedicated.

Still trying to get into this solo title. So far I do enjoy it. Slightly disappointed in the activation/placement/movement of enemy troops. Feel that there needs to be more depth here and more interaction with my tank. A very abstracted battle board does not help. But still - this is a great title and another very good solo design. If reminds me (and many others) of B-17 but with lots more choices to make. It is table intensive with lotsof rolling but you feel you are having an impact on the game with your decisions. Another must have for solo gamers especially those interested in armor combat.

RANK: 806

RATING: 6.4
This is a true co-op in every sense of the word. Incredibly fun with new people and people new to gaming as player interaction level is high but ap potential is low. It's actually pretty tricky to win solo and the decision making process is just about right for light distraction. - Recommended by John L., GeekSyndicate and just about everyone else.

This is a great family themed game. It's made even better by the Wizard's Tower expansion. We like the Co-Op feel, where you have to work as a team to "win", yet it's nice adding up your monster kills at the end to see who was the better warrior. This is a great "thematic victory", as you can all relish in the victory, but still have a way to strive to be the best.

It's also nice how it plays out that if you are too focused on "winning" for yourself, you'll doom the team.

Great family game. A keeper.

Quick game that's more fun than average.  Kids love it and anything that gets them to the gaming table is a positive in my book.

Game is a punisher.  Luck of the monster pull plays a big role in the outcome, however cooperation goes a long way to helping sway the odds.

Great tower defense game.  Takes the concept and brings it to cardboard life.  It can be difficult, has a very strong element of luck.  The game isn't autopilot, but the best choice is mostly obvious.  We've only played with 3, and it has been fun each time but each game has had a lot of quarterbacking.

Sort of a bland co-op game. I felt like I was just waiting for the bad guys to get into their places so I could use my cards on them, and I felt like deciding what card to play when was pretty obvious. The red area of the board looks really strange, too (are those mountains?).

This is a cute little family co-op game that I would say is more geared for the kids than anything.  I'm probably a little bias about that considering I don't usually like co-ops at all.  For the most part, if I do have one it's usually for the purpose of helping to teach the kids how to control their emotions about winning and losing.

This is not my favorite co-op, but it's not the worst game in my collection either. I'm the ony one in my group to have any fun playing it, but I don't have any great desire to play it much myself.

It's like a better version of [thing=65532][/thing], namely because it doesn't go on for hours, and a game I could enjoy with my children.  I like the theme and the game play.  The only drawback was that it wasn't very challenging, at least in the 2-player version.  We lost one castle and never had a sense of impending doom.  I think house rules could fix it (lower hand count?  draw more tiles?)

This game is certainly fun, and adds something different to the table in ways of cooperative games. I like the element that you can also be competitive with other people in addition to working together, as you really have to choose your strategy carefully, and if you are too preoccupied with personally winning, everyone loses. Very neat and fun, and with a great theme. I plan to pick this up.

Love the random selection of enemy rushing towards your castle. The variation of enemy units and their associated powers brings more chaos and desperation to a crumbling defense.

Card play is simple but excellent for 'driving' this game to its climatic end.

RATING: 7.5
A coop game that has enough flexibility in the rules to let you play the way you want and still provide for a fun game. The completely cooperative game is a great family game. The rules are simple enough that younger kids can get in on the fun. The game does require some thoughtful planning ahead and that would be the limiting factor on the age level needed to play although I'm sure a young child in a family would still have a blast helping mom and dad kill the monsters to protect the castle. The coop with a winner version provides enough opportunities for backstabbing your fellow players to still make it fun. But it's a tough line to walk since not helping your fellow players here and there can end up pushing the momentum over to the monsters really easily. The game can have some wild swings in momentum. A couple of tile draws can really swing the balance in a big way so watch out and keep an eye on what nasty tiles are already out of the bag. The Overlord version of the rules takes the game in a new direction and adds full competitive play in a similar fashion to Scotland Yard or even Ghost Chase with one player against the rest. The game works just fine with a good range of players (1-6) but the planning aspect and card trading really come out in games with more players.

A cooperative game that is rather simple in concept.  Keep the monsters from knocking down your towers and you win the game.  The first day I played it twice with 2 players then once with three.

RATING: 7.5
I had shied away from rating this game because I had only played it a couple of times. This has truly been a year of co-ops for me so I was worried that this one would not stand out. That's not true at all. Although Pandemic is likely just as fast as this game and the decisions might be meatier, I would say that this is just as fun because of the fact that it is only semi-cooperative. I've played it about half cooperative half standard and I have to say I prefer the standard rules quite a bit.

It makes the game tense, but you have to have the right group to get into it. I'm interested to try some of the different variants in the game such as the overlord or the my castle is my home variant, or the variant where players do not start with any walls. Truthfully I can see this game being played a lot. Here's to hoping some expansion sets come out with different monsters or effects!

Castle Panic is a fast and highly entertaining game with some ingenious game mechanics. It is not difficult, takes about an hour but ensures fun and excitement.

This was a lot of fun.  The game is somewhat random, and defeat can be determined by a very horrible pull.  In the first game we played, we had the 4 tile chit come out of the bag, and two of those four were boulders, with another being one of the bosses.  The second game had 8 tiles come out on the second turn of the game.  So random, yeah.  But it has tension, which I like :)

Played without the master slayer variant.  To me, it seems absolutely silly to have a pseudo-cooperative game in which some people could tank the game just because they are going to lose.  

Additionally, the strategy/tactics of the game are painfully obvious after you've played a few cards.  Very little depth that suffers the problem of other non-timed cooperative games.  Space Alert is still the king of cooperative games in my book.

Das Thema ist gut (Tower Defender). Auf dem PC oder Spielkonsole ja schon seit langem bekannt. Diese Brettspiel Koop-Version sah in den Review Videos interessant aus. Als Koop-Spiel ist es kein schlechtes Einsteigerspiel. Mit der kleinen Nichte (8) ein paar mal erfolgreich gespielt (sie fand es schon sehr spannend gegen so viele Monster die Burg zu verteidigen). 
Mit 3 erfahrenen Spielern ist das standard Koop-Scenario jedoch nicht fordernd genug. Der Sieg war schon (zu) fr√ºh unabwendbar :-). Da hilft wohl nur die versch√§rfte Variante ohne fertige Startmauer. Meinen erwachsenden Mitspielern hatte das Spiel nicht so gut gefallen.
Als Solospiel mit versch√§rften Anfangsbedingungen aber durchaus spielbar. Vor allem mit der Erweiterung [thing=104590]The Wizard's Tower[/thing] wird das Spiel eine Herausforderung.

This game was not fun at all. I love co-ops but this game felt totally random and I was just dropping whatever cards I happened to draw. There was almost never an interesting decision that I had to make. I would trade a card that was helpful to someone, use any card I could and then pass. Even the board and art wasn't very cool looking and the components were lackluster. Hope to never play this again.

Very fun, puzzle-like coop game. Decisions are on the easy side, but this is the way to keep the game lighter and more family friendly. There will be tense moments which i like alot. The only cons i could think of are:

-the base game is too basic, you NEED expansions to play it properly

-for my personal taste, i would prefer to have harder decisions to make through the game. Although i understamd the reason of designing it this way, as stated above.

One play, six players, and the poll agrees with my suspicion that it's not a good player count for the game.  Really simple (too simple IMO) competitive coop game, which didn't do much for me at all.  I could totally see enjoying it with kids, though.

8th Board Game I bought :D As indicated, it really is a Family-Oriented Cooperative Game (not that brutal IMO) :P Seems pretty easier with fewer players since you hold more cards which gives you more actions you can take and makes anticipating movements of monsters easier :D Good Game :)

As an introductory co-op game, this is pretty good.  As an advanced co-op game, it is a bit too light.  Decisions are good but after a number of turns start to feel a bit 'rinse-n-repeat'.  The game balance is pretty solid and it really feels like the game has been well tested.

Tower defense done exactly as I'd want it done in a tabletop environment. Mitigate the randomness of draws with cooperative strategy. The game is so elegant because it all makes a lot of sense, very straightforward and you have that tangible, visible effect of losing the towers and castles, or reinforcing them. Superb game, I only wish there were a fraction more content and variety in the core set, but otherwise it's an instant favorite.

Loved the short quick and chaotic feeling this game brought the first few times I played it at a small convention. 

Later my roommate bought the game and we played it on and off for a few years. It seems to run between utter chaos and walk in the park but when you got the tension and chaos right the old spark was there.

Pro: Fast Pass, co-op chaos experience, players work together to stop a never ending onslaught of orcs, light hearted fun that is easy to teach and fast to set up and play with some good moments at the table.

Con: Can get repetitive, I think we over played it. Maybe more of a filler or intro game, I don't miss it since our copy moved to BC. 

We played it on and off for a few months, still super fun and easy to teach. But started to feel repetitive after a while. Still a great game, I don't think I would turn down a game per say but I am more likely to pick up the newer Dead Panic! for the new theme and card variation.

Bonus point for being family friendly.  Maybe a little too family friendly considering how easy it normally is to win.  It's the Kraft Mac n cheese of boardgames.

RATING: 4
A coop that just doesn't hit the mark. The base game is too deterministic as the choices are usually pretty obvious. The expansions definitely improve the overall gameplay giving the players more to work with and making the monsters more interesting...but it also adds significantly to the length to a game that was already overstaying it's welcome. Even with more stuff, the game starts to feel "samey" as the monsters really aren't all that different from each other. Also, the expansion content adds fiddliness and rules overhead and if you don't have someone who is very familiar with the extra rules and abilities, expect to refer to the rulebook often. If I'm looking to play a light/medium coop with a few friends, Pandemic easily is the better option.

I was very interested to play this after hearing about it being featured on Wil Wheaton's gaming webshow. It combines the current craze of tower defense games with a board game. I loved the concept, but I felt that there was not much you could do about the randomness of where the monsters spawned. The actions deck is evenly split between each of the sections, but if the monsters frequently end up spawning in a color that you have already used all the cards of then its just a matter of time before they get to your keep.

Played our first game today, 11/1/09.  It was a lot of fun, really tense.  A lot of thought goes into that 1 trade you get.  We lost on the last monster token drawn "move all green monsters"... moving the monster into our final castle.  I have thought a bit about this game over the past couple weeks and wonder just how much luck goes into this.  Playing again soon to evaluate this.

This is a very nice, streamlined cooperative game.  The rules are really straightforward, and it plays in a very quick timeframe.  Some of the decisions seem a bit more rudimentary, but that makes for a nice change for people who don't like so many options on their turn (which can slow down some players in a game like Pandemic.)  I think these aspects of the game make it an ideal cooperative game for young people.  If you play fully cooperative you can really teach them the mechanisms as you play and, even if it takes them awhile to understand how things work, they will still feel like they are contributing on their turn by slaying monsters and building walls.

As for playing with adults, I can see this one also working in that scenario as well, thanks to the Master Slayer rules.  Adding in that competitive element will challenge players to balance their own selfish desires with the needs of the overall team.  Personally I lean more towards the fully cooperative game, but I like having the competitive option.  This game has a fun theme that is very well executed (I especially love when a boulder goes rolling through crushing monsters as it makes its way to the castle.)  Sure the decisions are fairly straightforward and the game is a little lacking in strategic depth, but for a silly fun competitive/cooperative experience, I don't think you will go wrong with this game.

(KIDS) Seems quite clever... more so than I was expecting.  When we played it with the whole family, we didn't hurt the monsters when they took out a wall or tower and we were demolished.  My wife and I tried it and followed the rules properly.  We obliterated the game and it wasn't even close.  Hopefully, we can find some middle ground.

I'm finding that I'm just not enjoying this game.  It seems like it should be neat with a fun theme and some clever mechanics that keep the game simple and should create some tough situations.  Maybe I need to play the game with 10 year old boys, because with adults and younger kids it just is not working.  It never feels like everything stacks up quite right... maybe it's too random.

I've played it five times and not sure when (or if) I'll play it again.  Maybe when my son is older, I'll try it with him again.  Maybe not.  Seems like there are so many better options for cooperative kids' games (e.g. Forbidden Island).

In my two most recent plays with my 3 and 6 year old kids, the games were very close and quite a bit more fun.  The kids are really loving this game so I've bumped up the rating a full point.

I think my group likes this more than I do.  I like strategy games to have more difficult choices.  It's a good fairly light co-op.

I think more games should use it.

I guess Castle Panic makes for an excellent family game, as it isn‚Äôt either too easy or too difficult: anyhow, it lacks any appeal for veteran gamers since there are few decisions to be taken, insomuch that the game feels like it almost plays by itself, with seldom interventions by the players.

As a tower defense cooperative, Defenders of the Realm is still the better game.

Because this is so easy to teach and fun to play with kids I'm rating this higher than I typically would. It may be intentional, but a lack of options in one turn cascades to future turns since you only draw as many cards as you consumed in the previous turn.  I don't like this.  Sure the game is cooperative, but I'd rather feel like I am contributing just as much as the other guys even though my card selection sucks.

Fast, simple, fun co-op game. Haven't felt a real pull to play it more often though since there's not much interesting to do in it. We've never bothered to keep score to see who "wins," we just play it as pure co-op. Good filler game before or after the main event on our game nights. Played with two and three players.

Seem a bit easy. Once we cleared the board it seemed like we were waiting around for the meanies. Ok we misplayed it 5 times before we relized that it's not the color that takes out the meanies it both the color and code. Changes the game a whole lot.

A friend of mine swears by the "Tabletop" show for all of his board game choices. He pulled this out recently and we played it three times in a row... When it comes to co-op games you can do way better than this. I mostly found this game boring, not too much to think about. Luck (especially of the "bad" variety) is too much of a factor as well. Have no intention of ever playing this again, not when I could pull out "Defenders of the Realm" for a much more satisfying experience. Will Wheaton has terrible taste in games, and unfortunately, so does my friend!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As a game for kids, I'd rate it much higher, for adults ... very meh. There is little planning, little control and the game is just dull. It's all about trying to empty your hand every turn so you get more cards so you can do stuff. And with lots of play the chaos is extreme, you can't save a card to use next turn as there is no guarantee the monster will be in the right area by then.

So, worth considering as a co-op for the younger crowd, for older gamers if you want a quick co-op go for Pandemic (there's more game there) or longer Arkham. Although my favourite co-op at the moment is Space Alert.

While I've grown to really dislike this game, the kids love it.

I've always played this cooperatively, ignoring the "winner" calculation of who scores the most kills. This is a game my son wanted to pick up after watching it played on Tabletop, and he can still be talked into playing it on occasion.

Waves of enemies pour in toward your castle, and you try to fight them off. A little weird in that you often hope for a well-placed boulder attack: sure, it might take down one of your towers, but if it did enough damage to the enemy on the way in then it's worth it. Becomes more complicated and difficult if you add in the Wizard's Tower expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've rated this a 7 to indicate that I would probably play it if a group of adults wanted to play it.  With my kids, this is a solid 9.  It is a perfect weight for a 6 year old - it allows me to give guidance, but has simple enough game play that he can do most of it himself.  It does a good job of teaching the kind of decisions that are often made in gaming, and allows us to win together for extra bonding.  Just perfect.

This is a great tower defense game that is very simple to learn and pickup and can be played in a reasonable amount of time. This game is a coop which is a big plus in my book. It's also fairly hard to win at times which is nice to provide a challenge in that way. The generic fantasy theme fits well for what this game is, a light castle defense romp. The game can be played solo which is always a plus as this provides a way to learn the game and practice strategy while alone. There are a couple of great expansions out that add some depth. Overall this is a great pickup and one that I think a family can enjoy for multiple plays. I recommend getting this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an excellent game and has been a ton of fun to play with my boys.  They really get into this and there is a lot of tension.  We've won some, we've lost some but we've had a good time playing.  The rules were simple enough for them to catch on quickly as well.  The one concern I have is about the replayability of the game.  I can see it getting a bit stale after numerous plays, which is the only factor keeping this one from being a 10.  I'm hopeful for expansions one day, which would help rectify the problem.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is a hybrid between a cooperative game and a competitive game.  Cooperative in that, if the players don't work together, everyone loses.  However, once it's obvious that the game can be won; it's competitive.  Yet, by then it's too late, if you weren't getting your kills; you're in trouble.  There's a tug between trading to help the group and holding a useful card to help yourself. I like the game, but I don't take it seriously.  Card draws and timing have just as much to do with the final winner as individual play does.  More a game of tactics than strategy.

Great game to play with kid(s). With my daughter we've recently gone through Uno and Hey That's My Fish, and this is now one that's getting closer to a game I may play with friends anyway. We've only played twice so far and she's making good decisions and we won handily last time. We'll either have to make it a bit harder with house rules, or pick up the Wizard's Tower expansion.

You must play this with the Wizard Tower expansion. I am teaching my 4 year old to play this game which is very exciting. It is pretty simple to play, hence my 4 year old is picking up on it relatively quickly. Good solo play with the wizard expansion as well. I find myself pulling it out to play when I need a gaming fix and I don't have anyone to play with.

Family friendly co-op that is good for those times when you want to win. Yep, it's easy, but with the right group, it's a blast.

It suffers from the domineering/bossy player problem that rears its ugly noggin far too often, but with the right all-for-one, can-do attitude, this one is great.

The kids love this game, as expected, making it a good family game. Kids enjoy this a little more than I do, myself preferring Adventurers. This is a bit lighter, which may explain our preferences. Or it could be the monsters. Anyway, nice coop game with an option for competitive play, and just the right length of play. Still, fairly obvious choices are presented for each player, with a heavy coop element.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a collaborative tower defense game, with a "there needs to be a winner" twist. Only thing is that this "twist" (aka. the one who has slain the most monsters win more than the rest of the group), doesn't actually work that well a a concept, since the game doesn't allow for the players to make many "mistakes" before they all are overrun by goblins
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not a deep game.  Kill the monsters before they kill you.  2 year old daughter loves pulling monsters out of the bag. Great game for 6-12 year olds to learn cooperative play, basic strategy planning, and the concept of inevitable defeat.  Will play occasionally with my wife for some quick, relatively mindless fun.  Will keep this until the kids are grown.  Also a good quick solo game to play, which I know I will pull out every so often, but can see tiring of quickly.

I played X-Wing and a friend of mine told me about a tabletop episode about it with Wil Wheaton. After I watched it I skipped through the channel and got stuck with Castle Panic, my personal relaunch of boardgaming.

Kind of boring and way too easy. We kept house ruling it to make it harder, but kept winning. When we finally lost for our first time I was done with the game. Will play again if my niece and nephew are around.

UPDATE: The Wizard's Tower expansion is a huge improvement. The game is more difficult now (but still too easy, IMO) and has a lot more variety. Prioritizing one tower over the others makes for a more interesting game, as does the addition of the wizard's deck.

Two-player game. I like this! Very light. Very random. Not that difficult (except in spots). But relaxing and occasionally tense play, with some "take that" mechanic in stealing kills from your partner/opponent. UPDATE: 7 -> 5. On further reflection, this game is just wafer-thin. Every turn, you basically just play every single useful card that you can, and give one useful card to your partner(s) for the next round. It's pleasant enough, but not compelling, and I'm not sure we need to play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent enough die rolling co-op for families and children, which has a nice story arc as the attackers close in.  However, it's simultaneously too random and too scripted for my tastes.  You've little real option for the most sensible move most turns and little real affect on the outcome - unless you can guarantee die roll outcomes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed Castle Panic, but it's a tough sell. It manages tension quite well, and is fairly short, and so has a good fun factor. On the scale of coops, it's pretty simplistic, simpler even than Forbidden Island, and Forbidden Island is about as low as I think I'd want to go (although obviously Space Alert demonstrates that complexity isn't the answer either). The opportunity for meaningful player cooperation is fairly limited, just one card swap each turn, and the tactics are pretty straightforward and less intuitive than they should be. It's honestly a pretty fun game because it manages the drama pretty well, but as a game it's caught in the crossfire between Pandemic and Cutthroat Caverns, both of which are vastly more interesting and replayable in my opinion. Not bad, and I enjoyed playing, but not one I feel a need to add to my collection or one I would ever suggest playing myself.

Another decent entry into the co-op arena of games.  While I didn't feel as if there were any super hard choices and that most of the decision making was fairly obvious, the difficulty is set as such that the game experience keeps you on the edge of your seat.  So, they really hit the sweet spot as far as the difficulty level goes, which to me, is really what makes or breaks co-op games.

The game is fairly light, which makes it perfect for playing with the family.

Unless you are playing with the one person wins more than everyone else rule, there really isn't much of a game here for people who have mastered noughts and crosses.

Awesome game. Just played my first set of games yesterday. Rules are quite simple but the tension it creates with the never ceasing march of monsters towards your castle is absolutely riveting!
 
I lost my first two games badly, but on the third try I vanquished my foes with just two out of six towers standing. It was that close! I would like to think it was due to my impeccable game playing but if the truth is to be told I was lucky in drawing the right cards at the right time. Nevertheless you never know what's going to happen each turn.
 
Best thing I like about this game as opposed to playing with 1 to 5 other players is the down time for solitaire play is incredibly short - 30 seconds between each turn. And in those 30 seconds you are still actively involved in rolling the die for the monsters and moving them towards the castle.
 
Out of the hundreds of games in my collection I would say this is the [b]BEST[/b] solitaire game in the light weight category. (By light weight, I mean the complexity weight rating is between 1.0 and 1.6). Most games in that category offer fewer strategic options and lack the thematic atmosphere that this game so successfully provides! Beautiful board, menacing chits, quick setup, and standup walls and towers, makes this a winner!

I probably won't play the base game again unless I'm playing with children; the expansion offers much more decisions! In the base game, there are few special cards and only 3 kind of monsters (and some bosses) so I don't care much for it. There are many other co-operative games which work much better!

My recommended number of players: 3, 4

Not a bad introduction to cooperative games, especially since there is a slightly competitive element. However, the difficulty seems a little swingy, sometimes being too easy, sometimes being too hard, and not often presenting a balanced level of challenge. 
Its worst quality is that it creates a "team leader" scenario more than any other cooperative game I have ever played. You may as well give all your cards to the player with the strongest personality and just watch.

Semi co-op ruins this for me. "Oh hey, let me help you take down these enemies or otherwise we're going to lose. Oh you get those points? Oh, you scored way more than me? You beat me really bad? I WONDER WHY!"

Then it's just tower defense, and I've never enjoyed any tower defense game ever, electronic or otherwise.

Bought mainly because of the coop game mechanic. This was to give a family member who really only wants to play coops another choice besides Pandemic.

It's an ok game that I won't object to playing. However, there is not a lot of variety and the play & strategy isn't all that deep. As the rating says: I'll play sporadically mainly as a change from other coops. Any more frequency & it will get stale fast.

This is a fun, easy to learn, cooperative game.  Good for younger kids.  It's fairly quick as well, so it will probably see quite a few plays.  It isn't as interesting a solitaire game as Pandemic, but it's worth getting if you have elementary school aged kids.

Due to its easy-to-learn rules, this game can be enjoyed by everyone, while the solitary game really is as challenging as the rulebook promises. To me, this game is the perfect proof that a game can be more involving than Yahtzee without the need for extensive or complicated rules.

The balance of the game seems to be just right and the different variants (full co-op, semi co-op or 1 vs many) all change the game enough to change the experience, while the rules stay simple.

I would recommend this game to everyone except perhaps the most die-hard gamers.

I would say this would be a good game to use to introduce kids to the cooperative board game genre. For experienced adult players though, it's just not very interesting and is too simple to beat.

it also uses the cooperative with scoring mechanic which I find a bad design choice as given the ease of winning this one starts to wonder if it was intended to be truly cooperative or not.

My 3yo son cannot get enough of Castle Panic. We play with all the cards up, but normal rules after that. 

I am completely stunned and amazed at how this game has taken a hold on him. Every new monster that comes out is studied with questions like, "Daddy, why is he wearing an eye patch? Did the archer get him in the eye?!!"

When the Special Monsters come out we open the rule book to look at the big pictures of them, which usually turns into an impromptu story based around their appearance and their special ability. At night, the only bed time stories I tell are based on the Castle Panic monsters. In fact, we now have the adventures of Miyu (me-you) the Goblin, which is an ongoing saga from night to night - the story started (months ago) when Miyu was forced to flee back into the enchanted forest from the courageous Hero who was protecting the castle. (In the latest episode he and his loyal side kick - Spotty the Flighter Spider - battle the wicked witch to get her broom, because it was made out of a branch from the enchanted talking tree, which had been cursed and could no longer talk - the only thing that could lift the curse was the return of the branch (the witches broom)).

Recently I saw the Castle Panic rules laying on the floor up in his playroom. He had taken them out of the box and was flipping through them like it was one of his books and he was telling his little 2yo brother all about the wild and wonderful Castle Panic world!

This game is worth every single penny. We essentially use it as a prop to tell big elaborate stories over the evening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a great game for nearly any group, especially family or casual-gamer friends. My mom even enjoys playing Castle Panic!

To whom it may concern, this game is VERY random, with player abilities largely based on card draw. Monsters are (literally) drawn out of a black bag and placed randomly. This can make the game very swingy and chaotic, which I think is perfect for what it is. Some turns, everything seems to be under control, and then you'll suddenly draw the Draw 4 More Monsters token and a Troll King, and everyone around the table panics again!

The game can be played solo, which some people enjoy quite a bit. However, what I really love about Castle Panic is laughing and slaying monsters with some friends or family, cheering yourselves on when you're doing really well and groaning when that Giant Boulder doesn't mow down all the monsters for you. Trading with the other players around the table can also make a huge difference in your ability to deal with monsters, and if you're dealing with some pretty cutthroat players, it can quickly become a negotiation game. I've given Castle Panic a try solo, and it just didn't seem to have the same life and frenetic energy.

But still! This is a fun, light game good for almost any group. The rules are incredibly simple and intuitive, and everyone I've played with seems to jump in and have a blast every time.

RATING: 7
I enjoy Co-Op's quite a bit. Pandemic Legacy, T.I.M.E. Stories, and Forbidden Desert are among my favorites. Castle panic shines for its elementary nature. I don't actively seek out to play this one all that often, but would bring it out as a gateway Co-Op. I'm holding on to this so my kids will have another option to play.

Love this game. My SO and I play this at least twice a week. It's very straight forward to play. The chaos that ensues at times (drawing the Orc Warlord, Draw Three, and Draw Four tiles at once, for instance)can make for some very exciting, tense times. Even when we lose, we still have a blast. Looking forward to getting an expansion or two.
Also, introduced this game to middle school students and they love it. They've even put the 3D printer in the tech ed lab to work printing castle pieces so if the cardboard ones get lost, we have spares.

When played solitaire this game feels quite easy. You're really at the mercy of the monster tokens drawn, the dice rolls, and the cards drawn - the decisions to make are rather straight forward, thus is doesn't feel too strategic. However, playing with other players make add a layer of decisions since cards will need to be traded. I also like the concept of playing cooperatively but also trying to be the player who has slayed the most points worth of monsters.

This is a simple game in the impending disaster genre, but the components and rules are designed very nicely.  This is high quality and it shows.  Although I like the game, I don't love it - perhaps it's too simple?  But have only played it with 2 - would be curious to try it with more players.

UPDATE: Although this is harder with additional players due to card distribution and limits on trading, it's also more exciting.  So the multi-player challenge lives up to the games promise.  I'm upgrading the rating for this a bit.

Downside - you can win and lose on the die roll.  Roll the same number too often and you're just screwed.

I really enjoy this game. I find it too easy but with some variations it makes it fun and exciting again. I look forward to playing it. I find that I like this game much better playing solo. It is more difficult with 1 player and it goes real fast. I'm increasing rating since solo play is so much fun.

-Set up Towers and walls. Randomly place the Wizards Tower in place of a normal Tower.
-Shuffle Castle Cards and Wizard Cards.
-Remove appropriate tokens to play with expansions.
-Draw 6 tokens (before adding Harbringer Tokens) for each Archer space before the game, excluding bosses and effect tokens. Roll d6 to determine which arc they start in.
-Add 3 random, unseen Harbringer Tokens to the Monster Bag.
-If SOLO play, draw 6 cards.
-Begin Game!

RULES NOTES:
-Only way to get Wizard Cards is during step 2. Discard and Draw 1 card. The draw may be from the Wizard Card deck.
-NECROMANCER: Monsters....not effect tokens.

-SOLO PLAY NOTES:
-If you discard two cards during step 2: Discard and Draw, you may draw 2 Wizard Cards.

Okay party/co-op game. Has some dramatic moments. There is lots of potential for player interaction, but not a lot of depth. I don't like how the card play works, and the optimal choices are often obvious. The Wizard's Tower expansion significantly improves the base game.

Played it about 15 times and I like it but am getting tired of it.  If you are a gamer the wizard expansion makes it more fun and decisions harder.

It's an situational game for me. When in the mood for co-op with non gamers it's a 10 star game. When with 5 or 6 players gamers or non gamers and not mutch time to spend, it's a 8 or a 9. Every other situation it leaves the shelf only if we had wine or we are not in the mood to do some thinking/planning.

[Played only as cooperative] Fun, if susceptible to the usual cooperative problem of "the best player advises everyone else on what to do". However, adding a 30-minute game timer solves this quite nicely (if the group hasn't won by then, the game is a loss). It keeps gameplay scrambling, and turboboosts the AHGAD MORE ORCS theme. Once 30's no longer frantic, lower it to 20, and/or add some of the "make it harder" variants from the rules.

This is my 9-year old's favorite game (an easy 10 in her book). She wants to play at every opportunity. Several of her friends (all girls) enjoy the game as well. We win about 50% of the games we play and she's become a ruthless Master Slayer (sometimes killing us all in the process). As a Dad introducing gateway games to my kids, this has been a huge success. But, it is literally a castle-defense game and I personally enjoy more story-arc in my games. The game deserves a high ranking just for how good it is for kids, but for me, I'd rate it a 6 or 7.

My rating on this game started at 7, then to 8 solely because my wife would play this with me more than any other game we owned outside of Pandemic.  She favors the cooperatives.

Down to a 6 because it has lost its former luster for both of us.  It's still a fun game every once in a while.  But unless we play with someone new, there is little challenge left.  Victory is almost guaranteed in a multiplayer, even if you lose a few towers.

Castle Panic is a very light cooperative game where the player defend a castle from attacking enemies. I love the look and the feel of this game. It is simple to learn and plays quickly while keeping all players involved at all times. However, there are not that many decisions involved in playing this one. It occasionally feels like the game goes forward on auto-pilot. This makes Castle Panic especially suitable to play with children and non-gamers.

GREAT cooperative gateway game!
I use this one to introduce people to co-op games, because I've found Pandemic to be a bit overwhelming to people due to the high number of options mixed with strategy. Castle Panic still has options and strategy, but not so much to be confusing. The color matching aspect makes it easy to learn, and the board is layed out easily in the different ranges of attacks. Every new turn that brings more monsters ratchets up the tension, but it also brings more opportunities for strategic play. Being able to trade cards with other players helps, as does the player count going up to 6 people. I've played this with a 47 year old and a 9 year old at the same table, and we all enjoyed it!

It was kinda fun to try to stop the monsters from storming the castle.  The downside was that there was a lot special abilities of each monster.  Combine that with trying to use the right card which all are somewhat special...and it played a bit longer than I prefer.  But I left the table thinking it was fun..and that's a good thing.

RATING: 6
A solid game for small and large groups. I have played it from 2 to 6 players, and would say that it's most enjoyable with fewer players (more close interaction). It's an easy game to teach, which is a plus. My two complaints are that games can feel repetitive after you are familiar with the game, and the plastic stands are terrible. They are not made to fit the pieces very well and they fall off easily (I have lost a few because of this).

Such a fun little time-filler game.  So simple yet extremely fun to set up and play.  The game kind of plays itself a little once you learn how to manipulate the card system (ie. play as many cards as you can every turn - refreshing your hand is the key to winning on a consistant basis).  Still, it's mindless fun and was a good purchase.  There are enough variants in the rule book to challenge you once you become good.  Great "gateway" game for non-gamers.

A light, fun game that plays very well solitaire.  There are more important decisions in this game than it seems like at first glance - and the best solutions are not always the obvious ones.  There is more than just a little luck involved, but you *do* have to prepare for what is potentially going to happen if you want to win.  It is almost *always* a tense game right down to the last turn.

The 1st expansion is truly awesome and changes my rating on this game from a 7 to a 8.  Would never even consider playing without it now.

Gets bonus points simply because it is so good, fun, and quick to play solitaire.

Played once last night with the wife (non board gamer) and we really enjoyed playing it even if we did loose.  Love the boulder which can create havoc and have some funny moments and the boss monsters are a great touch.  

I can see this being a great family game and can't wait to play with my kids when they are older.  I would of liked more creatures but the expansion will sort that issue out and have already ordered it.  Can see this getting played a lot.

If adding the expansion this game goes up to 8.5 for me.

How is this not a mass market game?   It has all the right ingredients to be a successful mass market game with a co-op element to boot.   It's essentially a video game in board game form, and that's precisely why it misses the mark for me.  Would be far more fun as a video game.   I guess I don't like open-handed co-op puzzle solving games.  But, it's super simple and has great appeal to kids.

This was a great coop game to get my sons (8 & 5 at the time) into more advanced gaming.  We've evolved past it by now, though.  If you don't have children, this is probably going to feel like there's nowhere near enough useful decisions you can make.

Very simple game play, easy to get to the table and play when you don't have the energy for anything too heady. The coop also means there's no grumpiness from tired, cranky players losing to tired, cranky winners.

RATING: 7.5
A great game, has never failed to impress. After 5 plays or so, got a lot easier, and a little boring. We played the overlord scenario a few times, and that livened things up quite a bit. Great stand alone game though, would buy again.

RATING: 8.5
Terrific co-op game for children, young adults, and non-gamers. It's easy to learn and it teaches a variety of gaming concepts including planning ahead, teamwork, and even some simple probability. My 4 year old daughter loves the game. The violent theme may be a bit too much for small children, but it's easy enough to say that the archers and knights are "chasing away" the mean monsters rather than killing them.  

As a gamer's game, I'd rate this somewhat lower- probably 6.5 or 7- but it is still very enjoyable, with an interesting theme and fun artwork.  

One of the biggest draws here is the ability to customize the game in so many ways. For younger players, there are rules to simplify by removing some of the harder monster tokens. There are also rules for solitaire play, and a version where one player controls the monsters!  I expect my family will continue to have fun with this one for a long time, and as my girls grow older, we can incorporate more of the "regular" rules. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase.

Fun enough, but I'm sure it'll wear thin if I play too much. Also, I feel like you either get steamrolled or you win hard, regardless of some choices made. I guess it is one of the more solid light coop games still

This game is not my style, though my fiancee loves it.  I should also add that I'm not much of a fan of tower defense video games either.

Due to the cooperative gameplay, I do not feel likes it's multiple people playing the game in order to try to win as a group, but one person (or a brain-trust) playing multiple hands, while the others not included in the brain trust turn into yes-men. Maybe we're not playing correctly.

RATING: 6.5
Very entertaining albeit a very frustrating game.  We won our first co-op game by the skin of our teeth.  It's nice to have another co-op game in our library, but it probably won't be at the top of our gaming shelf.

Killing goblins, orcs and trolls will always be good fun though. :o)

RATING: 8
This is the one game my daughter keeps asking to play over and over again. More than likely, if you are a heavy board gamer, this won't be the number one game on your shelf, but it is very fun none-the-less. The beauty of Castle Panic is that its easy, its fun, and its coop. Much like Pandemic and Forgotten Island, you take your turn, then you take the monsters turn, so its coop, but there is no player that you are trying to defeat. I think it makes a great family game and the fantasy element is really cool. I just love when I see my daughter slay an orc!

Fun game for the family. Liked playing with the kids. Very basic game. Set up castle monsters invade...use your hand to kill encroaching orcs,  goblins, trolls etc. I do like that there are "bosses" that can enter the board with special powers. The art is bland making the game look a bit underwhelming. Overall a fun game but not one we are all racing to set up and play.

RATING: 5
This is more of a sit back and chill game with friends.  I don't like that the person who gets the highest point count in kills wins the game, as it seems to defeat the purpose of a shared cooperative win.  I've played with a few folks who take getting the most kills seriously and it makes the game not fun.

Also the game gets pretty repetitive after the fourth or fifth play when you realize that there's a way to win the game every time, but that's when you ramp up the difficulty with one of the many options listed in the rule book.

Despite all that, the game can be fun. I think this game probably works best as a family game or a younger kids game.  If I owned this when I was a youngster I would have been all over it, and when I turned old and grey (wait, that's starting to happen!) I'd look back and fawn nostalgically over it and weep for my lost childhood.

The expansion also makes this game a good bit better.

This is a light co-op game by a small publisher.  You're basically trying to fend off your castle from an onslaught of monsters by trading cards that either dictate the region where you can damage units or have special abilities.  I have a lack of interest in it because it's better suited as a family game, than challenging coop for gamers.  Being a small publisher the art could have better but at least the design is incredibly functional and it includes a concise set of rules.

This is a great game to play with kids. It can be a little easy to take over things, but that's sometimes a plus for my youngest (age 9), who feels like we are teaming up to win the battle. It's a very easy game to win, but there are always times when you are sure you are going to lose, which makes it exciting. The Wizard's Tower expansion improves it and makes it more of a challenge.

A great game to play with my young daughter. I look forward to adding the expansions at some point to make it a bit more difficult.

The whole 'it's a coop game but one one player wins' at the end really doesn't do anything for me. Additionally I think this mechanic will slow down any type of negotiation since players have really two objectives (save the castle, win the game). On top of all this, I really don't think there needs to be another coop game out there. What keeps me from really trashing this game is that it did handle six players pretty well.

I wouldn't normally pull it out with adults (thus the overall rating), but for my six-year-old daughter who likes cooperatives it is just perfect, and I really enjoy playing it with her.

Plus, rolling for boulders is just fun.

Fun light tower defense game.  I much prefer the basic game to the expansion.  The base game is a non-thinking beat-em-up type experience.  

The expansion tries too hard to make things difficult; it's the "gamers" expansion.  The expansion runs so contradictory to the feel of the original that my wife and I played once and never again.  For a game I intend to play only once every few months, there's no need to introduce an expansion that can force you to lose no matter how well you played.  Unless you play Castle Panic every week, don't bother.

My son likes this game a lot. It's good for kids since it is a co-op game and very simplistic but also fun for adults. As a word of caution, with hyper-active kids it can be challenging.  My son tends to want to control all the action and take all the "cool" cards (barbarian, draw two cards, etc) despite its affect on success and gets aggravated when we attempt to explain strategy.  He is only 9 so still needs some more game training but otherwise, this is good for us.

Not the most sophisticated game ever, and the Wizard expansion is an absolute must to make this game replayable. But Castle Panic is a fun change-of-pace for its uniqueness and plays well with any level of players. Work together to thwart the raving monsters attempting to storm your castle. Can be really challenging to win, despite its simplicity! A good, solid cooperative game.

Nothing really new here in this co-op game.  Easier, & similar Ghost Stories mechanics--a good game for a 10-14 year old, then they graduate to more intricate & exciting games.  Don't get me wrong--I will enjoy playing it occasionally when it is late at night or introducing new gamers.  It is a good game for what it is.

I just read the rules again and I see there are suggestions for upping the difficulty.  Nice.  That improves the game.

A graphic improvement I would make--sometimes easy to miss the green monsters on the green forest.  The monsters need to be a color that stands out more.

When played with The Wizard's Tower expansion, this game gets kicked up several notches on the Awesome scale.  Very, very tense and fun.  It is not unusual to lose all hope several times throughout the game only to somehow pull off a win against ridiculous odds.

This is good fun, inspiring lots of goofy table talk and camaraderie. It works well solitaire, but in that form it's dependent mostly on luck. Playing with multiple players gives a greater mix of tactics to dilute the luck. The excellent expansion adds a ton of stuff to the mix, making it a much more hectic and exciting game. In our last game I felt we were doomed the whole time, but we ended up winning with only the wizard's tower remaining. It was most satisfying.

Castle Panic is a cooperative game of tower defense. Cooperative games need to be challenging in order to entertain but Castle Panic fails on that front: the game is neither particularly difficult to win, nor are the player actions required to get there particularly hard to come up with. In fact, moves are mostly obvious and semi-automatic. As such, Castle Panic doesn't work all that well for gamers. I can see it become hoot with younger children, however.

I liked this game a lot more than I expected to.  A few friends of mine had played it and knocked it for being too simple.  I agree that its simple, but there IS strategy to it.  In both games I've played, there was a legitimate threat to us losing the game, but after a well thought out discussion on strategy and a few fortunate card draws, we were able to press on to victory.

The added game modes sold me on making this purchase.  Very happy with it so far, we'll see how it holds up after more plays.

But it's disadvantage is less of various event and enemy.
If you play twice or more, you will need more variant to make this fun again.

RATING: 2
One's ability to do anything is limited by the cards he draws. Any effect that doesn't damage a monster exists to try to manipulate its position so that you can kill it rather than another player, but since those players haven't drawn their cards, you can't rely upon those abilities being useful whatsoever.
As a cooperative game, it's too easy, but as a semi-cooperative, it is too random.

A light, co-op game with monsters, warriors, and a 3-D castle.  What's not to like?  Well, it is a bit light and random.  To be fair, the target demographic is probably a bit younger than your average BGG crowd.  Still, I enjoy it and wouldn't mind seeing it come out every once in awhile.

Played once so far.  Definitely simple, but a few wrong decisions means death for the players, so it keeps you engaged.  When you want a good filler dressed up as a board game with a bit more meat than most fillers, this fits the bill.  I think it fits a niche and will be especially great for family and non-gamers, while still engaging gamers.

RATING: 6.873
One of the co-op games that works because there is also a single winner element - - straightforward, but ok (29/12/10).  UPDATE: Been a while since I have played this, I think with the expansion it will probably be better, but till then rating is 6.873 (Feb 2015).  UPDATE: Still an ok game, although it plays like a cardboard computer game rather than a board game - still a rating of 6.873 (July 2015). UPDATE: Includes Wizard expansion, which yet (and unlikely to play) but treat both as this one entry (Sept 16).

RATING: 6
A fun time generally and a game that really promotes the co-operative spirit. The way the card trades is set up also helps build on the co-op. This game is very light, with the cards in hand pretty much deciding how things are going to go, with a number of other random elements as well. That being said, the game manages to sustain tension by the way the monsters attack the castle. As well, the way in which players must plan is effective and doesn't cause much brain-burning. The game doesn't last too long either, but can't imagine I'd want to play this more than a few times. Must get stale. However, I would definitely see this as a great entry game for kids who will eventually get into heavier games. For that it has my respect. We all won! Only one tower remained with the monster right on its base. Phew! Played regular rules where a player got to be named the 'Super Slayer'. Points system not really necessary, though, and could mess up the win if someone gets greedy!

I believe my wife got this for me as a birthday gift a few years ago. By no means a bad game, but after a few games I find it somewhat dull - the special abilities in the deck are the most interesting part of the game to me, but there seems to be too few of them. I think I would like this game far more (and it would have far more replayability overall) if there was a secondary way of obtaining/purchasing extra ability cards, rather than just hoping you draw them on a turn where they could be useful.

I recall reading that the expansion helps to keep this game a bit more interesting, so I may look into picking it up at some point, but for the time being, I think there are many, many other games that I'd rather play instead.

Bought this for just over 20 bucks at Barnes and Noble on sale, and it's been my best purchase for family game nights in quite some time.  Most games either seem to bore my wife, are too complex, or the theme is just too much for her.  This game was near perfect for her AND my daughter, and still appealed to the fantasy geek in me.

Our first playthrough, 3 players (wife, daughter, myself) was a loss at the last minute.  The last monster on the board took out the last tower on my daughter's turn.  After many discards, trades, etc. it came down to the wire, and we just had unlucky card draws (Being that the bugger was in the castle really hurt...lol).

Wife loved it, my daughter was disappointed at first that we lost, but then was glad that we came so close and immediately asked to play it again.  This game has been just the right fit for our "Family game nights", appealing to everyone (Which is REALLY hard to accomplish in this house...lol).

Second playthrough, we won with 1 wall and all but one tower remaining (a boulder took it down, but also wiped out the Goblin King, a Goblin, and an Orc on it's way in!).  The game was still very tense at times, especially when we first started, and it seemed like everything was just flooding the board from all areas.

My soon to be 7 year old daughter, was starting to grasp more of the "Strategy" of holding onto certain cards, and looking more into who to trade with, so repeated plays of this will only help her to grow in relation to strategy/planning in games.  She also won the "Master Slayer" title at the end, besting me by 2 points.

We got this game to have something to play with a much younger crowd. Many of our potential gaming couples have small children so we were specifically looking for a game that we could play with 5-7 year olds that would still be fun for us adults. This game works very well for kids and possibly even an introduction to pandemic for them. Very simple mechanics coupled with a quick playing time make this game an excellent recommendation for younger gamers.

What an awesome game.  The game is fun and tense at the same time. The game has a few variations, which allow you to play it to your liking, which is a very nice bonus. Their is even a solo version that is a lot of fun. I have yet to beat it solo, but continue to have fun trying.

The components are very nice and I love the monster chits and how you rotate them for their hit points. Absolutely clever, This is a great game for everyone including family, children and gamers. The game plays quick and most people will want to go at it again. Depending on the number of players the game can be tough. Especially the solo version, but it just keeps you coming back for more. If you find the game too easy. Well there are varients to increase the difficulty level for that also.

I highly recommend this game to everyone. You'll surely get your moneys worth from this game. Especially beings that it is pretty cheap to begin with.

Many thanks to boardgameswithscott.com and Tom Vasel for their excellent and informative reviews on this game.

Close, but just missing some extra rules to make it more fun.  It's basically pure coop and it's sort of silly that the different player positions even exist.  Decisions are limited and the only reason all the players don't get one big hand is because of an artificial limit on the number of cards you can trade.  I like the idea, but the execution just falls a bit short.

Maybe with some house rules?  Definitely a kids game in terms of density of decisions.

I've never understood the proliferation of 'tower defense' games, the only mechanic that's been more overdone is the 'remove matching sets' numbers.

This was the first "co-operative" game I have played.  I think that the key to games of this type is all players being in a similar frame of mind...working together.  If one player tries to turn it into a solitaire game while commanding others some of the fun starts to go away.

Fun tower defense game which is easy to understand and to teach. The mechanics are original and well-implemented, and if you enjoy cooperative games this is a must. For those who think that without the expansion is too easy, one of the goodies I got in the 2017 Tabletop Day was a new tower which makes the game even easier. The base game lacks variety in terms of monsters, but with three expansions so far there is no reason to complain.

Castle Panic is a simple, fun cooperative game. It's easy enough to play with family or non-gamers, but engaging enough to play with gamers.

The basic game may feel a little deterministic, with there being pretty clear correct actions, but it is very fun nonetheless.

I'd recommend, however, that if you're playing the game with a gaming group, you should consider getting the Wizard's Tower expansion. It brings the game to a higher level of complexity and difficulty. It will force you to really take some time to strategize.

Fun, but flawed. 
After you play a few times you realize that there is almost always one exclusive "right" action to take on any given turn. So, you perform that right next action, then the game takes a turn and beats everyone to a pulp.
Repeat.
This is a "boss" game players dream, because they can tell everyone what to do, ignoring any attempt at individual free-thinking, and then ignore suggestions from the group when it's their turn.
And that's the big flaw. There's no wiggle room for free- thinking. it's an on-the-rails roller coaster, but unlike a roller coaster, it's a little too long.
The game does provide tense fun for a cooperative group, who are willing to talk out the best move and not take advantage of more timid players.

Found it all rather boring.  The choices presented each round were obvious - no tension between trade-offs - and there really wasn't much excitement.  Probably a good game, as several reviews have commented, for a mix of young kids, and adults, but not much here for anyone older than about 9.

RATING: 7
This has been fun every time I've played it, but I find myself hesitating to introduce it to some adults because of its simplicity. That may actually be one of its strong points, but the lack of "meat" keeps it from being recommended every time. Still, I play games with a lot of teenagers and my wife enjoys the casual gameplay, so it'll be sticking around quite a while. Besides, none of my kids are old enough to play yet, and this one definitely needs to hit the table with them in another year or two.

RATING: 5
Seven plays, both with and without Wizard's Tower expansion. 

A tough game for me to rate, because overall I think most people would find it pleasant and accessible, but now after seven plays I'm pretty much done with it. I'm not a fan of cooperative games, and if you play by the "standard" rules there's always the chance that someone will get bent out of shape if you choose to lose to the monsters rather than let another player win.

I also think there's not quite enough going on, but that may add appeal for casual gamers.

Birthday present from H&C+A&B 2009. Played for the first time on 28/12/09 with I&K and family.  Everybody enjoyed it and the mechanics worked much as Scott described on his blog http://www.boardgameswithscott.com/?p=295 An interesting game mechanic where the hero's are fighting the game and co-operation is essential. We think it would work well with children in the 9+ range but had enough to be interesting for adults

RATING: 7
Fun co-op game (all the players vs. the NPC trolls, orcs, and goblins) with a decent strategy-to-luck ratio (around 50/50).  The biggest downside is that, as with many co-op games, it lends itself to letting one player take over as the General, directing everyone else how to play optimally.

We hadn't played this until recently because we had always assumed that this was more a kids game due to the game board building. We had some free time, I couldn't walk anymore, so we slid into the demo booth at BGG.Con 2016 to play the newest expansion.

We were very wrong and I am more than a tiny bit ashamed of how long we have missed out on this very fun and almost completely cooperative game. Our demo involved one very long chain of evil happening to our board and we laughed all the way through it.

The mechanics are simple and it only took a full round to grasp it all. It's the simplicity that ensures that the gameplay remains fun and action-packed. 

We loved this game so much we picked it and the latest expansion up and then walked over to the handmade bag vendor, I think Blue Fairy?, and bought a luxurious and bright red microsuede bag with a colourful goblin warrior embroidered on it to hold all the monster game pieces.

Basically, we enjoyed this game so much that minutes after we bought it we had already customized the game experience for ourselves.

RATING: 7
Good, simple little co-op game, that's fun to solo of an evening. Gives a good sense of impending doom that I can (usually) avert at the last minute. It becomes more gamer-y with the Wizard's Tower; I just wish it was easier to mix and match elements from the expansion and base game and preserve the balance.

Rated as a family game.  It has good fun play, with a few decisions regarding what to trade and discard before playing your hand, also whether to damage a creature, so someone else can get the kill points, etc.  Fun enough fantasy theme, not dark or dreary so not too scary for kids.  Too bad inspired games like this don't get the shelf space they deserve thanks to hasborg and mattel clogging the shelves with mostly unimaginative glut.  Hope to see this in a Barnes and Noble or Target next year.  Good luck!

RATING: 5
Simplistic co-op filler game; good as introductory game. Too rote and easy to win for advanced gamers. Younger players, on the other hand, seem to lose their attention as the gaming group size increases. Too much down time between turns. I would suggest to keep the gaming group small in this case.

I like this for what it is. I like the mechanics. It is too long to be a filler, but it is about that light. I would like to see variable monsters, maybe a quarter again the amount, but randomly draw the required amount for play. A lot of people told me that the game isn't really all that good, but I think that they are taking it/themselves too seriously.

Played this twice thus far and I was in a panic for real in the first game. We (myself and my 2 girls) were down to our last tower with 2 trolls in the castle and we were about to lose on the next turn, when my daughter drew the boulder tile and then rolled a 5. The boulder killed a couple of goblins before going through our castle and out the other side killing both of the trolls. We all creamed for joy! We went on to kill the few remaining enemies. The next time we played we won it a bit easier. I look forward to gameplay #3.

A co-operative game in which the players are trying to defend a castle from hordes of attacking orcs etc. There's a competitive dimension too it as well, as players compete to kill the most monsters.

I played it once with 5 other hardened gamers and we found the competitive side really hampered our ability to deal with the monsters... so we lost. 

I think it might work better as a pure co-op game.. and may be more suitable for a family setting, than for strategy gamers (unlike, say, Pandemic).

I have only played this with my 6 year old son and his cousin. They had a fantastic time playing even though we lost when the last monster remaining knocked down our last tower after he breached our walls and got into the castle ring.

RATING: 4
I like the idea of cooperatively defending a castle against an invading horde of orcs, goblins and trolls, but this is a strange case. The base-game is, disappointingly, too simple and too easy, even with the suggested difficulty enhancers. It may be good for children, but seriously lack interesting decisions and replayability for adult gamers. The expansion "The Wizard's Tower" is simply obligatory, as it makes the game a lot better and engaging. If it were included in the base-game box, my rating would increase to at least a 7, possibly an 8.

I just don't get this one.  As a true co-op it's too easy.  OK for playing with younger kids, but I don't see it really with 'gamers'.

Yet, when you mix in the Master Slayer rules, I don't see it as that good of a negotiation game. There are much better ones for that.

juego graciosete y entretenido por cuanto a lo que es el elemento central de juego (estamos en un castillo situado en el centro del tablero y enemigos vienen del bosque hacia el castillo, y el objetivo cooperativo de los jugadores es rechazarlos), pero ademas del juego cooperativo hay un juego competitivo entre los jugadores por conseguir puntos y en √©ste la interaccion entre jugadores no me parece de las mas satisfactorias.

Fun, a good laugh- not much of a game.  Few meaningful choices.  Really the only choice you make is what to discard and what to trade.  Your only consideration is a balancing of trying not to lose while also hoarding the kills for yourself.  I think it is a great kids game but not much replayability in a gamer setting.  Maybe if you did a shot every time a section of castle/wall came down it would be more fun?

RATING: 7
Yet another cooperative game provided by a friend.  We enjoyed the theme of the game and the rather simple ruleset.  There's nothing entirely too deep here, but one person can monopolize the strategy to winning if you aren't careful.  That's an inherent problem with cooperative games and it rings through during Castle Panic.  If you don't see a move right away, your friends will be sure to let you know what you should do for the benefit of the group.  This may detract from new players as they just feel like a pawn from another player instead of feeling like they're involved and belong.  

I'm way too guilty of thinking for others myself, always trying to see the win condition in my head.  All in all though, a fun game to spend some time with friends.  Doesn't require your utmost attention, but still feels satisfying when you win.

I love that you can play it alone. I find it most challenging when playing alone, or when playing in a group and starting the game with no walls. It can be very easy some runthroughs. Turning the monsters to designate how many hit points they have left is a brilliant and simple game mechanic. The expansion helps make this a harder game.

Great game for board game newbies but gets boring when you're with an experienced group.

Too bad some illustrations are sub par because the quality of components is quite good.  The game itself feels too random.

I like to think of it as a cooperative game with a bit of friendly competition thrown in. You have to get along and help your fellow players but at the same time you need to keep your neighbor in check so you can beat them.
We've gotten to where we play this at least once any time we have a group of friends over for a board game night.

Our first game, with 6 players, came down to the last turn and the game was lost by one damage point to the monster waives.  This was very simply taught and understood by a group ranging from 6 years old to 50 years old.

I recommend ignoring the "slayer" rule to declare a single winner.  It is best as a co-op game working towards winning against the onslaught.

After dozens of plays I enjoy this game for what it is, but could never see playing it competitively.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

Really enjoyed this charming co-op effort. Just random enough to keep things manic without feeling unfair or stupid and strategic enough to keep you thinking without feeling bogged down. The draw monsters from a bag mechanic is excellent and free reign on trading. The theme also comes out in spades. Can see our group playing this enough, and lots of replay value with the ability for one player to control the monsters. Well done

I'm not sure I'd play this again with three. The game is simply drawing cards and then playing them to kill monsters that are rushing upon your castle, from all six sides! This feels like that scene in Aliens where the marines are being attacked, and slaughtered, from all directions. The board even reminds me of the scanner in the movie. From that perspective, it is an intense, if not hilarious semi-cooperative game.

From a mechanics perspective, this is simply idiotic. It's dumb like War is dumb. Draw some cards, play some cards, kill some monsters. Where is the strategy? You can trade one, and only one card with another player--I suppose that counts as strategy. Leave me out of this one, as this smells like another 'zombie' game like Last Night on Earth, which I detest, or that other horseracing game that is all luck--I won't mention it by name.

Update (1/26/11): Who am I kidding? Never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

I bought Castle Panic because I thought it would be a good game to play with my kids.  I was right; it is simple enough for them to get all the mechanics and even some strategy.  It was a huge hit when we took it to a Cub Scout overnight lodge trip.  Moreso than maybe any other game I've ever played, it is VERY easy for an alpha player/QB to completely take this game over and make it less fun for the others.  I find that I really don't play this with any adult gaming friends.  I don't know if that is because I started by playing with the kids and know there is this stigma at our place that it is "a kid's game" or what.  I haven't played with the Wizard's Tower; I may pick that up and see if that spices it up a little bit.

I bought this for myself, but it definitely suits kids better, and it went to my nephews after a few play-throughs with adults. My nephews (age range 5-9) LOVED it, and trying to pull them away from electronic media is a struggle - so that should tell you how good the game is!

A semi-co-operative game about defending your (shared) castle while trying to claim the highest monster body count for yourself. A bit of fun, but all absurdly random. A rolling boulder in a bad place will finish off the castle however well you've played.

We'll have to play it again as we messed up some rules early on for the first play. I would have rated this game higher but for the apparent lack of balance between random chance and defense strategies. Perhaps it's better with more than three people.

Whole family likes this one. 5-year old loves it. Just worried about the board peeling and falling apart already. The game deserves better quality components.

Update: Looking forward to the expansion. Board hanging in there...

The expansion really breathed some new life into this game. After 20 plays, we were getting too good at slaying the monsters. Now it's a nail biter to the end.

I love the idea of getting rushed from all sides by the enemy, and having to keep your walls safe from them. My art friends won't play with me because the art is too airbrushed for their tastes. But it can definitely escalate and have you all standing up and shouting about what to do next before a goblin king enters your keep to start taking down towers.

Allrightey, got this to play with my kids and have only had one 2P game so far.  Still, we really enjoyed it.  The rules were clear and concise and no big questions came up during our first play that we couldn't find easily in the rule book.  I thought all the components were fine, nothing felt flimsy or cheap.  This is a quick game to pull out and get going without a bunch of set up and rule refreshing. ****Played it about 10 times more, 3P and 4P.  Still a fun game, have won twice so far, but always a close game.****

This is a well designed coop game, but I have never lost this game. (I have played more than my logged plays.)

This game is not so much "strategy" as it is "logic."  With only a couple of exceptions, you know the monsters' next three turns, so the game is essentially picking the right cards and trading them around the table to other players in the single advantageous order.

Good, Light, Fun game.  Has a big luck component but can be mitigated by trades.  Harder with more players.  

It's a good Tower Defense board game.  Original in some aspects..but can feel tense when several monsters are about to take down all walls at the same time. 

Overall a fun, light, multi-player. Perhaps I need an expansion though. 

Update:  My game hasn't been touched in a while now.  I just find other games I own to be more worthy of play.  I still enjoy the idea of this game.  Perhaps, I'll have to get an expansion before I play it again.

This is a great, light game to bring out with gamers and non-gamers alike.  It presents a challenge, but not so much that it is not winnable.  It's very easy to learn, little down time, and it is a co-operative game with a non-offensive theme - great for families (and not bad as a solitaire game either).

Think of this as "Tower Defense: the board game" with Goblins, Orcs, and Trolls.  If that sounds at all neat, I would recommend it.

A very well designed fun little game, although there certainly is a luck factor in the game it is also very important to work together to try and make the most optimal choices.

I freaking love this game. I've loved it since the moment I first played it.

I hate this effing game. People say it's "too easy" but I've never even com close to winning. I've played games that were completely hopeless in less than ten minutes.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2013)

Lately, I have been drifting away from this kind of Co-Op game. It is a simple game with lots of uncontrollable luck (a huge minus in my book), easy decisions and alpha player problems. It is fun to play from time to time, some people have a blast playing this but it is way too simple for my taste. IMO all the decisions are kind of obvious, so you win or lose due to the luck of the draw. 

The game has great components and art. The monster bag is very nice to look at. The game is way better than Pandemic and  miles ahead from Flash Point. I like the theme (love fantastic settings)  and the game mechanics are very easy to grasp and teach. This is a family game, perfect to introduce new gamers to the hobby. 

I won‚Äôt be requesting this anytime soon, I won‚Äôt say no if I‚Äôm invited to a game of this, but if I won‚Äôt feel sad if I don‚Äôt play Castle Panic ever again. Not enough game for me.

Castle Panic is an enjoyable co-op game that is best when not taken too seriously. There is enough challenge here to offer a satisfying experience, but I'm not sure about long-term repeat playability. While it is a novel game with a fun theme, I don't see it as one with staying power down the stretch in the already saturated co-op genre.

RATING: 7
My 5 year old son and I enjoy playing Castle Panic together, and I also play solo. It's a light, easy to pick up tower defence game. There is not a stack of strategic depth, but it's a great introduction to co-op gameplay for kids and non-gamers. I have heard that the Wizard's Tower expansion adds more depth to the game. The component quality is not great - the board was totally worn away along the crease where it folds when I took it out of the box - but the castle walls and tower are quite nifty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I like the idea of a tower defence board game, and this is a nice light game that does it well. The only problem is that without the expansion it is far too easy.
Still, nice cardboard walls and towers plus a cool way that the monsters spin to show remaining hitpoints. It's fun, but go get The Wizard's Tower to go with it.

5/26/11 Love the idea of this game, though since the number of choices one actually has from turn to turn is so limited, the tensions never approaches what it should. For the tense co-op experience, Pandemic is still my go-to.

Castle Panic is pretty super.  I like the design of having monsters flowing into the center of the board (the castle).  It's a really fun idea and plays out great.  We've had a lot of luck, and then sometimes we don't.  It really depends on how the tokens come out and how well established your team is at certain intervals.  I like that there's a good balance of luck and strategy.  Add to that the teamwork elements in the gameplay and you've got an excellent cooperative experience.

I was very curious about this game as I had lined it up to play with my girlfriend as she has gone past the gateway board games now and so I was wondering if this would be too complex for her or even worse too simple (Had this happen quite a lot recently) and then also if I would like it too.


I was very happily surprised although I could see myself burning out on it if I played it a LOT but compared to other cooperative games so far this one has been the best for both me and my girlfriend, great theme, different play options, can also play more then 2 players if needed and has expansions so this is on my list to play a few times and maybe purchase at some point we shall see.

More fun with two players than with higher count. In recent six player game it became clear well before game end that we were not going to win. Though this is not an uncommon situation in cooperative games, there isn't enough joy in Castle Panic to make slogging it out under those conditions worth the time.  That said, when the outcome is uncertain and you're playing in a group that is either young or young at heart, it's fun.

The epitome of a good family game.  Conceptually simple enough for a 5 year-old to play and understand, while challenging enough for an adult to still find worth their time and fun.  Very cooperative, non-threatening.  

Replayability-wise,
I can see this running out of steam at some point, but there's an expansion out there that is well-reviewed.  

If you're looking for a very wholesome, but not necessarily bland family game, I endorse Castle Panic.

This is a fun co-op game. My 7 and 8 year old boys loved the game. The castle is composed of towers in the middle of the board surrounded by walls. Lots of monsters attack moving from the outer ring one space per turn toward the center castle. Cards are used to fight the monster. Strategy often requires trading for a better card with another player. It seemed fairly challenging and we barely won our first game. Various recommended modifications to the game scenario can make it easier or harder.

RATING: 5
I think it's rather boring;  but the master slayer twist saves it.  We've played a handful of times and have never been in serious jeopardy of losing.  Thanks to the master slayer thing, though, there are some tough choices about how much risk to take in order to secure kills for yourself.  

Good for little dudes, and thus good for the fam.

I found this to be amusing. Not a whole lot of decision making going on, but rather an exercise in how the cards fall, with an entertaining fantasy theme. I suppose in a multiplayer game you can try to withhold cards from your allies and time bigger kills, but so what, that's not the part of the game engine that makes it tick for me.

So far I have only played it solo (3 times) and I have yet to win (although my last game was a lot closer) It's a decent, quick solo experience. There's not a lot of strategy but I don't mind that in a solo game (Dungeonquest being a favorite). I'm sure this will be more fun with a few more players. As for the price (and that's important these days) you get a lot fun for your buck.

RATING: 5
A cooperative game designed for younger kids.  We lost the one time we played it.  Rules were pretty simple.  It was an okay game.  At the end of it I felt like the outcome was completely determined by luck of the draw.  In other words, I didn't feel like we had much control over the outcome.  It might be fun for 10 yr olds, but I wouldn't go out of my way to play it again.

This feels like a kid's game, but it a little too difficult to teach to very little kids. Being cooperative and light means it should be better for ages 4-6 than it actually is.

Just got this game for the family for Christmas 2015, and it has been a huge hit -- among kids ages 8-14 and me!  A little tricky to figure out all the monster types at the beginning, but once we got through a game or two with frequent references to the instruction book, we had it all figured out and really have had a blast.  Have been on the brink of loss several times only to have fun roaring back to life and destroying all the monsters.  LOVE that players win or lose as a group -- very different and fun, many fewer sibling squabbles and sore sport feelings. Really loads of fun.

RATING: 7
We picked this one up after watching Wil Wheaton's TableTop. As far as co-op's go, this is pretty good. Trouble is, we almost ALWAYS win. I think, we've lost ...maybe...once? Would like to see some expansions for this, as once you've played it 10 times, there is little left to inspire.
In general co-op's take a certain kind of group to be successful -- and by that I mean, a fun time, rather than a win. Sometimes a type A personality (ahem...sorry) can ruin the game. If you are type A, resist the temptation to lead/tell everyone what to do. You'll have more fun if everyone get's a say.

Weakest co-op I've played. Looks relatively pleasant, but is somewhat boring. You're losing together, but winning on your own which is stupid in this case, as in times you can just weather the storm leaving fruits for others to pick and trading cards with other players is also awkward because of this.

Castle Panic is a special case game.  When I saw the reviews, I saw so much potential for co-op fun.  However, the first game I ever played gave me a couple of feelings.  One, it is harder than it looks (my wife and I actually lost).  Second, there seems to be more dictating than co-op work.

I caught the dictating right away and prevented myself from trying to coach the game as much as possible to let my wife enjoy the thinking process for herself.  The game is simple enough and we end up winning the second game.  Then the game became overly simple immediately after that win.  The amount of cards, types of enemy, special effect monster tokens etc. all became too predictable.

I then tried a solo game, it got harder again, however there is just no fun in a solo game.  I rather fire up the computer and play something else with less work.

We finally got to try this in a 4 player setup, and through my group's eyes, I can see their expression and the fun I found in the game the first time I played.  This was played as a filler between two bigger games.  We decided to go for it again and play a second game just to see how well we do after they learned the rules.  This time we played the hardcore mode with no walls to start.  We donkey stomped that game and pwnt the horde...

I found that in that second game, the dictating came back but I've always tried to control myself and everything turned out fine.  The dictating isn't so much one person forcing the other to do stuff, but it was that suggestions kept rolling in from all sides forcing the active player to feel uncomfortable about "breaking up the group" sorta speak.  That hurts this game a LOT!  The fear of not being a team player is making this game less enjoyable than I first thought.

My rating of a 6 means that it is a game that's better than ok...  There are good sides to it, but it isn't a game I would pull off the shelf to play because I craved it.

Now with all said and done, I'm still keeping my copy.  I see the huge potential to teach kids and gateway them to bigger better board games with this game.  I think if scored with kids in mind, I would totally give this game an 8.  This simple game to adults can be immense fun and challenging to a group of 5 - 10 year olds I presume.  I'm going to have a daughter soon, and my nephew will be 5 in 3 1/2 years. (2011)  This game will see a TON of playing time when they come of age...

RATING: 8
This is a quality game, with the caveat that it can get kind of boring without any expansion content (which we have not yet purchased). 

A major pro is the open cooperative facet - this makes it incredibly easy to get to the table and get people playing as soon as it's set up, without extensive rule-explaining. All but the most casual gamers will enjoy; the premise and gameplay is straightforward and easy to understand. The length of turns is a slight drawback, particularly with inexperienced players, but most of our players have picked up quickly enough that the game starts to move along at a good pace. 

I would actually say the low difficulty is a drawback, and it's a good thing there are built in "more panic" options. It's nice to introduce a game that is nearly impossible to lose, but it becomes rather boring to keep playing a game with almost certain win conditions. Fortunately, it is pretty easy to adjust the difficulty level, but I would advise more serious gamers to jump right in to one of the higher-difficulty options, just to keep the pressure up.

For a light game, Castle Panic is great if your having friends or younger family etc over and want to bring out a game that isnt too hard to explain or to play.
Castle Panic fills both of these requirements - rules can be explained in about 3-5 min (depending how fast you talk and the audience) and play is co-op and fast, so everyone can enjoy this game.
Of course, being a light "non-gamer" game, it doesnt have too much for the more serious gamer - for those types, i would recommend Battlestar or Pandemic, however if these serious gamers want to play with some non-gamers and not get the blank, dazed look during the rules explanation, then this game should be in their collection :-)

I couldn't get rid of this game fast enough years ago.  But I looked into Cooperative Games again really in depth when our son was about 7 years old.  Some of the very things I didn't like about it from an adult perspective are what make it such a great game to play with kids.  Our son really enjoys it and its one of the games I have a lot of fun playing with our family.  I do enjoy it slightly better with 3 than with 2 since there are more options for trading a card (something either you can use this turn or see they can use on their next turn once monsters advance or even both ideally!).  We have never lost the game, even once, though we almost did on one occasion.  It's for that reason that I suggest picking up at least one expansion for the game (And I re-purchased this game knowing this requirement which I was less aware of when I initially got rid of my original copy).  That said we have played the base game a surprising number of times and still have fun with it.  Despite what some others have said I think the game doesn't feel too long.  Just about when it starts to its over in another couple turns or so.  Our 8 year old is actually ending up with all 3 expansions as Christmas presents from various people so we should have plenty of new Castle Panic challenges to conquer in the future.  I'm fairly confident I'll enjoy the expansions enough that I'd now play and suggest the games for an adult only group as well.  The base game though, by itself, I still wouldn't recommend without kids.

Castle Panic is a cooperative, light strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up.

Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest, at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win.

RATING: 6
It's an interesting tower defense game where the player protect their castle from invading hordes of monster. The game is simple enough to be played with kids or non-gamers.

The game seems also very flexible because there are many variant rules and 1 expansion released so far. It's the kind of game that you want to have more stuff or more variety for replay value. Else, after a few plays, I imagine you could get bored.

My only complaint so far is that I think the boulder tiles are way too strong. I think the reason we won the game is because at least 2 boulders destroyed more than 3 monsters when passing. Monsters that would probably have done more damage than the boulders.

So I would probably buy the game if I could get it for sale or in a trade.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The multiple layers of randomness (draw cards, draw monster tiles) really didn't do it for me.  It offers a mildly interesting trade phase and how tiles are awarded (based on kill) versus cooperative defense of the castle didn't have a good mixture or semi-cooperative for me to enjoy playing it again.

RATING: 8
Early rating based on co-op game only.  This is a fun family game that even my 6 & 8 year old children can play well.  I think this one will get a lot of plays.

Edit -- Solid family game that has kept its rating for me. My children are 4 years older now but still enjoy playing it. We can usually win, but there are always some tense moments which make it good for a family game.

This is a fun game to play with kids.  there is not much depth, but if you have kids that are under 10, it is fun to play.  We pull it out every once in awhile.

RATING: 6
Solo plays only so far. The game kind of plays you in this one. Choices are very limited, but the game can definitely be fun and tense at times. I have to see what it is like with more than just me playing, but I think this would be a great title to play with kids. Rules are well laid out, and easy to understand. All the components are very functional for the game. There just isn't a whole hell of a lot there.

I've got to admit, this game is a guilty pleasure of mine. It is definitely on the lighter-side of the games in my collection, and is substantially luck-based, but I love this game. My lunch group at work loves this game, too. We added all the expansions, promos, Litko, and Etsy upgrades, and each one of those things just improved the experience even more.

I'd put this in the same category as games like King of New York, Escape, and Jamaica‚Ä¶ just really light-weight fun that any age group can enjoy.

Very fun, light game. It has a HUGE quarterbacking problem however. 

In order to win the game you almost need a "quarterback" calling the shots which makes it less fun for everyone else.

Great co-op game to play with non-gamers and gamers.  Skill is not as important as the order of cards and monsters drawn.  Usually if you can survive the first wave of monsters then you will win the game.

While there is strategy to win, there is not a lot of different strategies so everyone will be working towards the common good.

RATING: 7
Fun coop game that has a lot of randomness. This is not the game you can plan ahead and set yourself up for success. It really comes down to can you draw the right cards at just the right time you need them and can you work together with the other players to make the best moves possible every turn. There are many ways to change the difficulty of the game which is nice (similar to Pandemic). The suspense in this game is what makes it a lot of fun. Good game for beginners.

* Odd co-op game in that players work together, yet also against each other. The co-op part makes sense, that later part seems at odds with the game.
* Seems to work well for non-gamers. 
* I am not convinced it will have enough replayability to last. The title of this review may sum it up, "[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/464699/castle-panic-worth-a-try-but-not-worth-a-buy]Worth a try, but not a buy[/url]"

One of my favorite co-ops, Castle Panic has a great mixture of mechanisms and theme. I know that some people are played out with the fantasy theme, but I actually haven't encountered it done right enough to feel that way. And I love the variety of monsters and powers that the expansions have added. The Wizard's Tower is almost necessary, as is Abstojnjnerg from the Dark Titan expansion. I believe there's another on the way, and I look forward to whatever it is because I'm sure it'll add some new crucial element to the game that fixes something that I didn't even realize needed fixing.

My 6 year old really loves this game although I find playing it with him a little tedious.  Lately he hasn't needed as much direction in his game play so it is becoming a little more enjoyable for me.  I have yet to play this adult only and I really can't comment on how it would play without having to direct the whole game but I'm sure I would give it a higher rating.

A really basic co-op. Just not much game here.

Like Pandemic, it's as much a multi-person puzzle as it is a game. Unlike Pandemic, Castle Panic doesn't have nearly enough input predictability to allow strategic planning.

Well, there is a castle and there is a feeling of panic so it does what it says. Sure, it's a game that pretty much plays itself - there are no real decisions to be made - but it can still be enjoyable from time to time either as a solo experience or with children. Expansions recommended for variability.

A simple co-op game, your castle is under attack and only troops (cards) deployed at the right time will save your towers from been eliminated.

Very light, too light for a games group but an interesting game for younger players... don't rule it out yet... there's an expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very simple in its concept, you are defending your castle against an invading army. Insted of playing one against the other, players have to team up against the game itself, sharing resources in order to beat it.
This variation allows for a completely competition-free game, where fun becomes more important than winning.
Rules are simple and well designed. Games tend to be smooth and are rarely one-sided.
Variants, provided along with core rules, allow different versions of the game, with different approaches, and different difficulty levels.
On the down side, there's really nothing more to it: one or two games and you'll have experienced everything this one has to offer.

I wanted to play this with my kids, and got it as an early birthday present.

This is a light coop game that is great with kids or a "beer & pretzels" game.  The advancing monsters and twists and turns thrown at the players is fun.  

The theme, easy rules, and artwork make the game fun and accessible to anyone.  

My rating is based upon desire to play this game with my daughters.

Cooperative and Family oriented!!!
Excellent family appeal.
Light strategy made for families (and kids).
Challenging.
Very respectable amazon rating.

Might be worth getting, but first let's get some more plays of Pandemic, Flash Point, and Forbidden Island.

This game would likely be suited more towards ZB. See the review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/484106/a-review-a-week-21-who-would-have-thought-goblins

First play of this with my 4 year old, who is really interested in castles.  I think it will be a big hit. As soon as she finished she asked, "can we play again?"  We took out some of the specialty monster tiles for the first game, and of course, she needed help with reading some cards and some rules, but by the halfway point she was already saying, "oh, I should use this to kill that monster, since there are three over there and just one over here."

To be entertaining and not merely functional, cooperative games have to make up the lack of human adversaries with either clever and demanding puzzles (like Ghost Stories) or with lots of anchorpoints for storytelling (like Arkham Horror). Castle Panic nicely illustrates this by offering neither and, predictably, failing to entertain.

I feel a bit disillusioned about co-ops--usually one player steers everyone else.  In Castle Panic, if you play the variant that allows for an overall winner (if the players win, one of them is declared a champion), that keeps people from being able to push each other around--I want US to win, but I also want ME to win, so I'm going to make the decision that's best for me.  I wasn't so much a fan of the variant that has one player as the bad guys and all others as the good guys--the game doesn't really need someone steering the monsters, they do just fine without help, and that REALLY slowed the game down.  The good guys lost both ways in the two games I played, but that's usually how co-ops go, from what I've seen.

This game can be way fun.  I first played it while sipping a beer with some new friends at BGG.Con 2011.  Since then those friends have become good friends who we always plan to meet up with at the con.

The game itself is a fun co-op with a nice theme.  And unlike Pandemic where one person can control the whole game, Castle Panic seems lite enough that everyone chips in and has a grand old time trying to work the problem with what they've been dealt.

The base game of Castle Panic is just horrible. It's boring, and un-inspired. Every turn is played out with little to no decisions, and it gets very repetitive. Basically, if you buy this game, you're almost required to also buy the Wizard's Tower expansion at the same time. If you sell or trade this game, make sure to sell or trade the Wizard's Tower along with it. Don't be that guy.

I found it difficult to rate this particular game.  I've tentatively rated it a 7, because I really enjoy playing it with my wife.  With the two of us, we've found it enjoyable to smash up some goblins and orcs.  

With others, I've found it either boring, or aggravating to play.  They either get caught up on telling me exactly what I should do during *my* turn, or don't actually enjoy the game.  It is very unlikely that I will suggest playing it with not-my-wife.

RATING: 3
2 / 5 - Fair.

I hear this is a kids' game apparently. That's fine - it could be fun as a family outing. But I played it with adult hobby gamers and it was mostly awful. Decisions pretty much make themselves and there's not enough strategy or narrative or even variety to keep it interesting. One thing that might work is trying to keep an eye on "winning" by collecting most monster kills during the trading round, but it's not anywhere enough.

RATING: 6
Space Invaders-ish castle defence game. Works best if you don't let one player take over the game. I don't see the point in everyone winning, but one player 'winning more than the rest' though. Good for kids, but too easy for adult players without the Wizard's Tower expansion.

RATING: 9
Played 30-35 times.

Update 2: You know, this is a relly nice solo game, too. As a co-op with kids or as a ligt solo game, I¬¥m giving this a 9.
- - -
Update 1: Tried the standard, semi-co-op rules with 4 adults, and I was slightly disappointed. I think this really shines as a co-op with the kids, and it¬¥s quite good as a solo game as well. I¬¥m happy with that.
- - -
This was an instant hit with my 4-yo. We play the full coop-version without optional rules. A little longer than most other games we play, but the tension is there til the end. This game was all I hoped it would be and I can see it becoming a 9. The rules are very straightforward and the rulebook is very well written. Perhaps I will try it with adults one day, but for now I¬¥m happy playing with the kids.

Card sleeves badly needed. Yu-Gi-Oh!-sized sleeves fit perfectly. And you really just need 49 sleeves, because the rest are player aid cards with the turn sequence.

Castle Panic is a fun co-op game wherein players are working to defend a castle in the middle of the board from waves of attacking Trolls, Orcs, and Goblins.  Said castle is made up of pieces of cardboard on stands.  Each time the castle, or its outer walls, are hit you simply take one of the pieces away.  If you ever have to remove the last piece of castle you lose the game.

The invading armies attack in various sections around the board, as determined by a die roll.  These sections are colour coded.  There are also rings around the castle.  The invaders start at the outer ring and move ever closer to the middle ring where your castle sits.  To help players defend against the attackers, they play cards depicting one of either archers, swordsmen, or knights that can attack in their designated ring and colour.  There are other cards too that can reinforce or even rebuild sections of wall, or slow down or push back invaders.

Castle Panic is a fun, and easy to learn/play co-op game that can be played with young kids.  The tension builds quickly as more and more invaders appear on the board.  Right from the beginning you wonder how you will ward them all off and survive.

RATING: 6
Good one to play with the kids...  plays like a virtual "king of the mountain" type game.   It has a fast pace and tension built into the mechanics.   It's a co-op game, but you can add a scoring system if you really need to have a winner.  The game plays fairly quickly and not complicated to learn or set up. 

It won't satisfy gamers that want a lot of "think" in their games.

Edit:  wasn't fast paced with 6 players and the expansions,  ugh!

Fun game with appealing theme that's easy to win in full co-op mode but increasingly tougher in Slayer and no-walls versions. We especially like night mode where tokens are only revealed in the swordsman ring. May look for the expansion, lots of plays with the boys already.

The Castle Panic base game is reasonably pedestrian and not too much of a challenge for seasoned gamers.  But good for playing with family.  Not too complex.  Simple enough for me to easily be an alpha player and keep track of everything, while quickly moving through the game.

Then we all win or lose together (mostly win as I'd see the base game would be hard to lose).  My 4 year old really enjoyed the experience.

For gamers who like an actual challenge, I'd rate the Wizard's tower expansion as an essential purchase.

My, how quickly things can turn on you in this game.  Cleared the board of monsters thinking I had everything under control, only to draw two monster tokens and within one turn had 9 monsters on the board at once.

Still won, but had a lot of slaying to do after I lost a few walls and towers.

Heavily luck-based but the fun theme makes up for it.  The random monster draws can be brutally difficult to beat when they line up just right (or just wrong), but we don't mind because that "oh no" reaction is part of the fun if you don't take the game too seriously.  Simple decisions for kids and fun enough for adults to join in.

A gentle introduction to Ghost Stories for kids. It has a lower frustration level, or to be more precise a different kind of frustration, it's a much more forgiving game. My rating is an average of the intense fun the kids have playing it, and the mild boredom of a veteran GS player. The game offers some interesting choices, plays very fast, the rules are clear, easy to teach, the artwork is charming. I have doubts if it works with adults only, but it's a wonderful, lighthearted competitive co-op for families.

Game in a Nutshell: Co-op game of protecting your castle from mobs of baddies coming at you from all sides.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: Great theme that's well executed. The ability to play semi-cooperatively is a major part of the game that really brings the experience to another level. I like the presentation from artwork to graphic layout. No reason this shouldn't scale well from two to six players or even solo if that's your thing. Really, just an easy game to play with all types of people.

Cons: If played too cooperatively the game seems far too easy. So to that degree, the experience may vary greatly from group to group depending on how competitive they are among one another. On the other side, I imagine that played too un-cooperatively it could lead to an even more unsatisfying experience. As simple as the game is, there's just a few niggly rules requiring extra text on the board that seem to break the spirit of that nature.

Other: The game comes with a load of optional rules. I'd like to test more of those out going forward... especially all the ones that are supposed to add difficulty. Really, I think I've only left a couple of those difficulty rules out when playing, so likely next game will be all-in.

Best Use: Need more plays to say...

I found Castle Panic while walking around the vendor area this year.  My wife pointed to it, and she said "I heard good things about that one." Later (not long before the vendor area closes), my wife was doing demos for other games,  I figured that I'd have some time to stop back and grab a copy of the game with good things.

The sales person was there along with Mr. Justin De Witt (the game designer, development, graphic art and design, etc).  I was asking Justin about the game, and he spoke very passionately about all the details (this is definitely his baby).  I bought the game, and asked him to sign my copy.  Justin was happy to do so, and I thought to myself that this is everything I love about (and why I support) the board game business.  It's accessible, friendly, and fun.  Good people, good games.  Justin invited us to play the game and have a chance to beat him (and have some snacks).  As much as my wife loves snacks, we were sadly not able to make it back for a castle attack.

After Origins (and a stormy drive home), I busted out my copy of the game at around 9:30 pm.  I figured I would assemble it all together, read the rules (or absorb it through osmosis), figure out single player setup, then head off to bed and ponder the game mechanics.  Hopefully, I would get a chance to play it the next day.  After opening and assembling it, easy breezy like, I picked up the rule book.  There's really not a whole lot of complicated things going on here.  I figure, hey, I'll do the setup so I can get that down then run through a quick turn.  I do so, and I think to myself, I can beat these guys. 

Suddenly, someone messed with the time-space continuum (probably that pesky Q - when will he ever respect humans and their needs).  It's now midnight, and my wife is home from the late shift wondering why I'm still up.  I can do this, that's why.  I can beat these damn Orcs and Trolls - first play through.  I had some good breaks, and I've lost three towers, but there's not many baddies left.  Someone has to stay up and finish the job.  Oh wait, job, and I have one tomorrow.  I finished the game, and I won, and it was intense.  It was every bit as intense as the instructions claim.  Man, I can beat them, I say, and I did, beat them, yeah, and I will beat them ... again ...

So, I crack it open after work the next day, and I throw it all up in seconds.  Soon, I'm pounding out Troll guts.  I get the baddie that summons three creatures - no problem.  Uhhh, I drew the summon 4 more token.  No problem, I beat this game yesterday.  Uhhh, I drew the summon 3 more token.  After finishing all the token draws along with the bad guy that moves everyone up a ring - I'm going down.  I know it, it's plain.  I'm going down, but I'm taking as many with me as I can.  It won't be a personal best by any means, but that Hero guy is looking at me.  I can't quit.  Sure, HE'S the Hero, but what will I be if I amscray?  I have to run it through to the bitter end.  Even after a killer draw with Barbarian, Redraw a card (Barbarian twice), Tar, Fortify, and a wall spackling job - I'm toast.  It was a proud yet futile stand.  The Trolls will talk about it as they digest my remains.  The count for me is one and one.

Yeah, I'm hooked.  It's an incredibly fun game.  Solo play is fantastic.  I downloaded the monster expansion.  I will buy any expansion for this game.  My head is coming up with new monster abilities automatically - how about a Grey Dragon that moves forward and rotates?  How about a Kobold that can move two spaces?  How about a Siren that will heal one point to one creature occupying the space after she moves?  It's addictive.  

Well done, Mr. De Witt, well done.

Fun game, but as with most co-op games, not everyone is really involved.

The loudest most outspoken end up playing mostly, telling everyone what to do.  The quietest people end up not really doing anything. Still fun, but you need to consider this ahead of playing, especially if you are the loud one in the group, you can easily take the fun from the less outspoken ones.

As a family game (with kids 6+), it is a very pleasant experience.  The turn order is simple and having all the unusual monster rules on the board is great for keeping the pace quick.

Children can look ahead and anticipate their turn, and participate in trades to help out other players.

I would not consider adding the "Master Slayer" rule... it would disturb the peace that is so hard to find when gaming with my kids.

Edit Oct 2012: The wizard's tower expansion explores a lot of design space and makes each turn a little more tense.  Great addition!

Fun tower-defense game, one of several this year.  Our first 4-player game took 40 minutes, which is about the right length.

I can foresee high variability in the outcomes - we had about 5 tourgh invaders worn out by boulders in our game, so it was much easier than it should have been, no doubt.

RATING: 4.5
Not bad, might be a better game for families/non-gamers. I'm concerned that between the cards you draw and the monsters you draw, there are very few actual decisions to make and that most of the outcome is up to what you draw. 

We played open-handed, and I think any real challenge or interest would come from keeping your cards secret and playing for most points. I'll play it but won't suggest it.

Every once in a while, I feel compelled to rise and defend the honor of the co-op game from friends who dislike them.

They bring up the lack of tension.  "But wait!" I say.  "Clever games (like Betrayal at House on the Hill) weave elements of the unknown through the game, ratcheting up the tension!"

They bring up player quarterbacking.  "But wait!" I say.  "Clever games (like Elder Sign: Gates of Arkham) use a dynamic board and aggressive, quickly-shifting obstacles to ensure each player is the master of her or his own fate!"

They bring up uneven downtime.  "But wait!" I say.  "Clever games (like Space Alert) build in natural limits on downtime, and ensure that everyone gets in on the fun quickly!"

Then they bring up Castle Panic, and I have to go sulk in the other room.

I like this teamwork game much more than Pandemic. Tons of fun, laughing and yes....Panicing. 1st play wife and I barely won with 1 tower left. 2nd game with friends didn't seem as hard, not sure if it was because you can trade with more people or just luck of the tile draw.

I have played a couple of games of Castle Panic one where we were pretty much steamrollered by the monsters and another where it was a narrow loss.

Either I'm not playing this right, or it's incredibly difficult (ages 10+??). Defend the towers from goblins, orcs, and trolls. Simple rules, but requires a lot of planning (which is often screwed up by random events). Have yet to make it more than halfway to the end of the game before the monsters destroy the castle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There are almost no decisions to be made in this game:  you draw a hand of cards, trade unplayable cards for playable ones and then play all the cards you can.  There is no strategy, planning or tactics.  Players can sit back and watch the monsters appear based on die rolls and disappear based on card draws.  This is only the tiniest bit more active than watching TV.  (Note:  I've played this a dozen time or so before I started logging plays.  I even tried to come up with house-rules before giving up on this - for me, it's just not working.)

I have only played this as a two-player game, with standard rules (no expansions). This is definitely one of my favourite games ever! A session takes an hour, which feels like short enough to sporadically want to play it, yet long enough to work up a strategy. I also like the combination of luck and strategy, it's a good balance.

I've played this game 3 times now with all adults each time. While there were some close calls in the games overall I felt like we beat the game fairly easily.

Fun little family chaotic game.  May be a bit on the easy side for a coop.  I've re-read the rules to see if we were missing something, but haven't identified anything.  We lost our first play and won every other one without any serious danger.  We'll have to see with a few more plays.

.....or not.  We have SO MANY BETTER GAMES that I don't see this coming to the table again.  
On top of that, one of my children snapped the mounted board when they were younger so the components are in no shape to reflect any sort of trade value.

Great game for what it was designed to be. My six year old loves it. However, be aware that without the "King's Champion" mechanic, the game is exceedingly easy. We now play with half the walls at start, and while it is occasionally tense at the end, we still have yet to loose.

Play, plan or adjust accordingly.

EDIT: Got pretty boring, pretty fast. Kids no longer want to play.

EDIT 2: Or so I thought. Had a trade lined up and the kids balked. Staying for now.

My wife bought this as an anniversary present as it's a fairly quick co-op that she's happy to play with me. I'm undecided yet on if this will begin to feel samey (haven't tried adding the expansion yet) but it's a nice level of puzzle and with pretty pieces. It will also be good to play with kids to 'train' them for the heavier games (I hope).

RATING: 7
A really nice co-op game perfect for family play. Players need to defend the castle against hordes of Orcs, Trolls and Goblins and must trade cards and use hand management to fend off the most serious threats to protect the towers of their castle. 

What's really great is that it is easy enough for young kids (9+) to play without an adult. 

Only criticism after 3 plays is that the game may be a little on the easy side but time will tell.

Castle Panic is a fun and light-hearted coop, that serves the niche of entry-level genre games well. Often the game plays you rather than the other way round, but its simplicity elevates the level of table talk possible, so it's not a big deal for me. Gamers may have to adjust the difficulty of the game, as it tends to be a little bit too easy.

RATING: N/A
Fun Co-op game where players try to protect their their castle from approaching enemies.  At some point in the game there is almost always a rush that makes it difficult.  You are never assured victory even when players completely cooperate with each other.  Sometimes it's the luck of the die.

A really, really great gateway game for kids into coop and strategy. It is VERY "play-by-committee" but in this game it works really well. I have taught this to a non-english speaking 8 year old, who played it with a friend, without adults the second time around.
Very easy to learn, challenging enough to feel rewarding, easy enough to win, to not feel frustrating.

I highly recommend this to families looking to foray beyond the normal roll and move games.

Castle Panic is an wonderful family game.  It's a cooperative game with a twist since there can be only one winner - the "Master Slayer."  Everyone needs to work together to stave off defeat but, at the same time, keep an eye out for opportunities to maximize your own VPs.  The rules are very well written and the important information is right on the board.  A big plus is that it plays in under an hour which is perfect for my family or as a "filler" between heavier and longer games.  I picked this game up on a whim and it exceeded my expectations.

Someone compared Castle Panic to a C64 game and I'm inclined to agree. Monsters pop out of the forest and approach step by step while the player play cards to slay them.

Fun tower defense Co-Op game!  Very easy to learn and makes for a great talkative game.  Every one is trading cards to kill Orcs, while all cringing together as difficult bad guys are drawn and placed in the same quadrant, making for a hard game!  Occasionally the game gets bland if easy tiles are drawn, or if strong cards are played early on.  Also, our gaming group found that playing with the maximum 6 players proves to be a formidable foe!  We have yet to win with 6 players yet, even after a solid 8 play throughs. This is a game I am glad to have in my collection, and will come out once in a while.

My goodness, night and day difference between inclusion of Wizards Tower and not. It was also nice being able to have access to Any Color Heroes, but the inclusion of spells added a lot more to the game than I expected. Will definitely be coming back to the table more often than I expected. Gotta manage threats better to keep them out of the walls! Once a Goblin Cavalry got inside the wall, I was unable to do anything to it. Turns out because my Wizards Tower was gone, I only had 3 cards in the Castle Deck that could have helped (and only 1 would have solved the problem).

I want to love this, I truly do.  But the uncontrollable way that a single bad draw can deliver 10 you or more new monsters just hurts.  Even played as a solo, there's just too little sense of progress.  Suddenly it's over - you're either overrun, or you've won.
It probably doesn't help that co-ops just don't seem to thrill my son.

Huh. I generally don't like co ops because they're really hard and tend to beat down on the players, and some co ops just feel unbeatable due to luck (for example, drawing horrible events first+second turn in Robinson Crusoe), but this one was a lot easier to win, so I actually liked it more. A lot of people say co ops need to be hard to stay interesting, but I would prefer a smooth ride to the finish with my friends thats mildly hard, and this delivers.

Its still a bit simple so I worry a bit about replayability, and its not that many things you can do on your turn, but you can do enough that it kept me engaged and interested. Overall, I'm not crazy about co ops, but I would be willing to play this again if it hit the table, despite its lightness.

But... undefeated after five games (though there's been a few close calls).
The best option always seem to be rather obvious, and as long as players are willing to help each other, I have a hard time seeing this being a big challange...
From what I've heard, the expansion makes it tougher, so I'm probably going for that.

Box art is terrible.  Map is underwhelming but serviceable - I wonder why they felt the need to splash the big honkin' "FOREST", "ARCHER", "KNIGHT", and "SWORDSMAN" text in each ring.  A less intrusive icon could have worked better and been more visually appealing - and made it easier for my not-quite-yet-reading daughter. 

Play with 3D printed tower and wall pieces to spruce up the cardboard castle components.

The interesting co-op castle defense mechanic intriqued me prior to purchase. Throw in the fantasy theme and I was hooked. In my opinion it needs the expansion which adds magic to your arsenal. Can be very challenging and even includes variant rules to keep gameplay fresh.

Fantastic co-op game!  Kids younger than the recommended age can play as long as you have some adults mixed in as well.  We all really enjoyed it, and managed to defend the castle on the first try.  I like that you can adjust the difficulty by changing the cards and monsters in play.

The game is fun, but the difficulty highly depends of the sequence of what comes out of the bag. Generally, this game tends to be too easy.

Castle Panic gives the feel of a tower Defense video game in boardgame form. Whether played solo, or in a team, beating back the advance of orcs, trolls, and goblins is fun and challenging, and yet simple to learn.

Usually I‚Äôm not a fan of fantasy-themed games, but the defender and enemy classes better lend themselves to this game than those in its zombie clone, Dead Panic.

Funny kids play with RPG mood. Don't play It as cooperative, use the "master kill" rule to get a layer of competition in game and It will be more fun. A great filler if your players like monsters, castles, archers and surprises.

I really like the mechanisms in this game.  It's a great coop game and works well with more or fewer players.

Goblins and orcs and trolls - oh my!

Well...not so much 'oh my' as 'so what?', as it turns out. It's another co-operative game in a niche market that is in danger of becoming overloaded. The tacked-on competitive aspect is much derided, not least by me. And after being brought up on Hero Quest and its ilk then, frankly, three different types of monsters to fight isn't very many or exciting enough. I get the lasting impression that Castle Panic is really no more than a shell of a game - something that will be much better after proper customisation, but distinctly inadequate as it stands.

Kind of a let down, but easy enough to play with family. Interesting how it's both competitive and co-op, to a degree; if no one cooperates (and the towers fall), no one wins, otherwise the player with the highest score wins. Also interesting how you want to trade away good cards to help the team, but doing so can mean giving points to another player. It's OK as a family game, with kids.

Great introduction to coop games for kids. My daughters (eight and eleven) love this game and have introduced it to their friends who also really like it.  We have given several copies away as gifts to both family and friends with children. The game shines even more with the Wizard's Tower expansion (really a must have expansion).
Fun to play with my daughters but probably won't pull it off the shelf with my adult friends.

Forced to slowly start agreeing with the consencus that this game plays you more then you play it. Very much a kids game or for afew beers.

Very fun and easy to learn for childs and for non players.
The problem is that there are too many non-monster enemy pieces, so it happens a lot that a piece who were supposed to be powerful with many monsters, almost doesn't do anything because there's only 1 or 2 on the board.
It also generates that there's almost no tension.

Simple game that really anyone can pick up in moments.  Cooperative, which is nice (although you have to be careful to not let anyone to try to dictate other player's turns).  Components are mixed, with the towers and walls being realy nice but the board being ugly.  But overall an elegant game.

My biggest complaint is that it's just to darn easy.  I've never lost a game.

Castle Panic is a cooperative game that, in terms of play, bears a certain resemblance to Forbidden Island.  Castle walls come down, but may be rebuilt, in the former just as portions of the island flood, but may be shored up again, in the latter, and players may trade cards among themselves to improve chances of group success in both games.  Castle Panic has a monsters-versus-the-knights-of-the-castle theme that appealed strongly to the 12 year old boys I played with.  The artwork on the board and cards is colorful and attractive, and all parts seem sturdy enough to stand up well to lots of play. The game created enough tension to maintain these kids' attention (no mean feat) and keep their adrenalin flowing.  They are a competitive lot, and not overly fond of cooperative games on principle, but they took to this one readily--especially with the body count at the end to determine who had been the most effective monster slayer.  I had a blast playing with them and especially enjoyed watching the level of cooperation gradually increase as the game progressed and they warmed to the idea of enlightened self-interest.  I had played a couple of solo games to learn the ropes ahead of time, and although I enjoyed them, I would have to say that this game is definitely more fun with several players.(3+4) Solo plays:2

Pretty easy to learn, although the rules about entering walls, then tower spaces bear repeated reading for clarity. A good party/family game, but for seriously geeky people only.

This is a very simple fast cooperative game! The center of the board is the castle walls enclosing the towers! You must protect the towers from all invading monsters! The board looks like a dart board with the target being the castle in the center! The card play is extremely simple...match the card to the invading monster's appropriate space! Awfully good fun here in this game! Great and especially quick and easy to teach to new players!

Almost completely random. This is something like 99% luck, 1% skill.

There's too much down time (with larger player counts), and nothing to do in your down time because you can't plan ahead. When it is your turn, there is usually a single, easily identifiable best move, so again there is no decision making involved. 

Some have suggested Castle Panic will be fun for children/non-gamers/stupid people, and thus fulfil a useful role by introducing folks to non-Monopoly etc. board games. However that doesn't make any sense to me - why not just play a good lighter game in the first place (like Ticket to Ride or Dominion)?

Fun enough idea but too long as there are not enough interesting options to justify an hour's worth of play, especially when trading cards with other players contributes to downtime too.

Draw a bunch of cards and hope that they match to the colour and area where the monsters are, which will allow you to whack them - so it's pretty luck based. You get to discard and redraw a card, and get to do a single card trade to alleviate some of the luck. Play your cards, then all the monsters move one area closer to the centre and you draw two more monsters. If they get to the centre without you collectively killing them, they whack the walls, and then the towers, until they run out of hit points and they die (hit points will be 1, 2 or 3 depending on the monster type) or run out of towers to wreck, at which point you lose. As you have 6 walls and 6 towers, it means a number of monsters need to make it to the middle without you getting them first, which is largely a product of of whether you get unlucky with all the monsters coming in one colour, or particularly bad draws in either the cards or the order in which monsters come out. So there doesn't seem like a lot of tension, but the game turns are fairly fast and is pleasant enough, if a bit long for what it is. It's ideal for my boys though, aged 8-11, who love the theme, love the whacking, don't mind the luck and love the idea that they're likely to win.

It's a simple game about defending your castle from orcs.   It needs some dice or something. Rolling dice and killing Orcs is awesome... playing cards and killing Orcs isn't nearly as fun for some reason.  I'd say it's a good intro-game if you're trying to get kids or non-gamers to play something.

"The base game is cute and fun, but is very simple and random, with not many decisions (at least as a pure co-op). The Wizard's Tower expansion adds a ton of interesting elements to the game, as well as lots of interesting decisions."

What I like:
- The cardboard castle is great for immersion
- Base game is very non-gamer friendly
- Often very tense, with winning or losing possible

What I don't like:
- Base game lacks interesting decisions
- Base game monsters are kind of dull

The expansion adds a lot of decisions, so for gamers it is a necessary expansion. I would put the base game weight around 1.6, and with the expansion I think it goes to 2.4.

I'm a big fan of co-op games so this one is right up my alley. Two to three players seem to be the best amount for this game. Two players can be quite challenging, with three there is a decent chance of winning. 

I'm not sure about the Master Slayer rules yet. It seems the co-op part of it is taken out of the game somewhat. Yes everyone is still trying to save the castle but trading cards isn't as likely. 

I haven't tried the Overlord rules yet.

Based on one play: A very light game that i think would work quite well with children. It is a coop game and you take turns playing cards to kill off monsters attacking the castle. But you must play together as the cards are very specific and can only attach certain areas of the board. So you trade cards with the other players to ensure you kill everyone off. Cute, simple and fun (more for the young ones then for the adults though).

Just when you think you have this game under control the hordes come screaming in. I have yet to beat it with 2 players. 3 Seemed just right. My strategy is to burn through the deck as fast as possible even if it means giving up a card you can use later. The real short coming is there are only two cards in the whole deck that can get rid of a creature in your castle. It would be a little better I think if:
Add more goblin tokens (level 1) as its very top heavy feeling with the Trolls (level 3)
Heroes can hit in the castle too.

Also on Co-op I find myself taking over too much and I have been forcing myself to stay quiet and let other players make decisions. Its just hard for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
Not the best co-op game, but not bad.  It is hard enough that you probably won't win everytime you play, which is what you want in a co-op game.

RATING: 4
Alright, so I'm starting to warm up to the base game a bit more. I still plan on leaving the 6 rating because without the expansion, it's a bit lackluster in decision making. It's a fun game but a bit too easy with knowledgeable players. I like the pure co-op version much better than this semi co-op nonsense.

(5+ plays)  Really enjoying this one with my 6 year old son.  He plays a lot of games, so the wizard expansion was needed... but that takes it just a bit too far.  He doesn't care.  It's just me.

If it wasn't for my kids, I'd probably have to get rid of this one.  The plays are really hit or miss.  There are a lot of really fun nail biting turns, working out the puzzle, making gambles.  And then there is turn after turn after turn where you have the game under control and it's just long and boring.

A fun introduction to co-op games involving crisis management. It's a bit too easy as a straight co-op, so it doesn't have a ton of replayability there. However there are other modes of play, including a semi-co-op mode where only the best monster slayer wins, which can introduce enough competition to aid the monsters against you to bring the challenge level up a bit.

Co-op tower defense. Light strategy, use card actions to damage advancing monsters, you can trade cards with players, at turn end draw chits to place new monsters or trigger special powers. Doesn't have tons of strategic decisions, so lower player counts work a bit better, not terribly difficult.

RATING: 5.5
It's an ok coop game.  My problem with it is the game tends to play you rather than you play it.  After a few plays the best strategy is easily apparent and then it's just a matter of going through the motions.  Usually towards the end I am ready for it to be over.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As I have only been able to play the single player campaign, I find this game a bit too difficult. As soon as I play with someone else, I will probably re-rate this game. I do like the concept, it isn't too heavy in strategy beyond working together towards a common goal.

UPDATE: I have had the opportunity to play this game a little more with other people, and I didn't find it very difficult for us with 5 players. With two players it was also a bit easy, even when we put all of the enemy tokens in play. Maybe it was just luck that we didn't draw any of the boss tokens before the end of the game or that there weren't many enemies to fight. Unfortunately, the "Panic" part of this seems missing. As a one player game it was quite difficult to play because you are only one person and only get to do one action each round before the monsters move in. We didn't try to play the Overlord or Competitive version yet though. Overall, this game is still about a 6 maybe a 7, not something that I found terribly fun, but maybe it still has potential. After all, It is easy to fold up and carry.

One of my favorite co-ops.  It feels age appropriated for almost every one.  The Game mechanics are wonderfully simple.  I even had the pleasure of playing this game with Mr. De Witt. 

Over all this is a fun game with great mechanics that can be modified to fit almost any group of people.

When the Wizard's Tower expatiation is added, this game become a "gamer's game".  The difficulty and game-play become more difficult to manage, but in a way that makes victory all the sweeter.

This game wasn't fun.  Maybe as a solo experience, but it was a tedious luck-fest might have been okay as a simulation, but seemed lacking in anything resembling a game.  (Note: This was based on a 6 player game.  It might be a passable 6-rating as a 4 player game, but that's being generous.)

There's not a lot of strategy to this game. The right choice is usually the obvious choice and lot of the game comes down to luck, however, there are a few tense moments that can play out in a very fun thematic way. I love the boulders and the boss monsters. Looking forward to the expansion to add some more depth to the game.

RATING: 8.5
Rated after two plays (12/18/09) - Played last evening twice and had a blast.  I have heard someone describe Castle Panic as having a slight "videogame" feel to it and, after playing, understand what they are saying.  The action is pretty fast and furious as you try to keep the hordes at bay.  Game play is pretty simple and should work well with younger boys and girls (if they are cool with the fantasy theme).  

I agree that playing with closed hands when playing the "master slayer" version works very well (I prefer it over open hands because it introduces an element of bluffing into the game).  We also played a purely cooperative game with open hands - and still lost.

I have heard some people say this game is easy - maybe it is, but it certainly wasn't last night.  2 games 2 losses and we weren't even close.  Whether that is an indication of bad luck or bad play (nah.... couldn't be that :D ) we shall see over more plays.

Update 1/2/10 : Have played several times lately with my sons and still having a lot of fun.  We have been playing "full co-op" and have managed to win (but just barely) the last several times.  I think my initial problem wasn't recognizing the values of keeping walls up.  Seems obvious now, but we were discarding too many lone Mortar/Brick cards instead of holding them until we had a match on the board.  Still an 8 for me in terms of fun.

Great fun with the kids.  The "panic" in the name really works for children as they desperately try and save the castle from an onslaught of monsters.

To me, a low key cooperative game that's good for the family and casual gamers. I'm gonna give this a bump because as the kids have gotten a little older they love this. They even start to compete to see who can kill the most monsters, which I haven't actually seen grown-ups do yet. "No, I don't think I'll trade right now..." What?

YB read the rules in 10 minutes and taught me and his younger brother Ninja Boy [8yo] how to play.  Had plenty of fun killing orcs, goblins and trolls.  YB's comment:  "Good choice Dad."  Good game to have fun with the kids - I'd say 8-14 is the proper age range for this one.  If you are looking for a "gamer's game", look elsewhere.

A short cooperative that would be a good game for a group of mixed ages (including children). For a group that's nothing but adults, I'm not sure there's enough challenge here for it to be anything other than a novelty. Maybe we were playing it wrong, but from what I've experienced I'm pretty sure I'd rather play Pandemic or Ghost Stories if we're looking to do something cooperative.

RATING: 9.4
A huge luck component, but surprisingly fun for all that.  You'll often be sweating for a Barbarian or 'Barbarian Redux' (which for some curious reason is called Scavenge).

Yes, the strategy, such as it is, involves burning through your hand as much as possible every turn, and (for most of the game) trading to allow other players to do the same.  And yes, you can lose even though you all play a perfect co-op game.

But if you play a bad game then you'll almost certainly lose, so you do at least know that you've done it right.

And the co-op / competitive twist is just inspired.  You need to play co-operatively for most of the game to have any chance of winning, but at some point you have to make the decision to switch to selfish play, and the judgement of that is critical.

Do it too early and you'll all lose.  Do it overtly and the other players may freeze you out of trades.  Do it too well and one or more losing players might decide to throw the game and try to ensure that nobody wins.

I can't think of another game with such a subtle, neat mechanic that leads to such tense, emergent gameplay, and that excuses a lot.

However, I would strongly advise sticking with the basic game.  The Wizard's Tower expansion drowns the lilly in toxic gilding and detracts rather than adds to the basic larks.

8.3.14 Dropped my rating from 7.4 to 6.5. The drop is basically in that the game is just too simple. While there are some choices most of them are easily to see and the threats are imminent, so the only real issues is when you lack cards. Still a fun co-op or family game and this will come out time to time.

Want a fun, semi-boisterous games to play with kids?  Want a night-cap that can be enjoyed without thinking too hard?  This is the game.  Chaos and lucky breaks control quite a bit of the outcome, but everyone will enjoy laughing and having a good time.  (Yea, there are competitive rules, but most people I know play this more cooperatively.) 

Won't be interested in playing this over and over, but for the occasional change of pace and light-hearted fun, this one is enjoyable.

Game relies a bit too much on a proper combination of cards and monsters appearing in the right sectors to be viewed competitively.  Play cooperatively, and enjoy the ride.

Castle Panic is a very good cooperative game that offers challenging play and plenty of replay value.

Castle Panic is a good game.  Game play is hard describe though.  This is a light strategy game of central castle defense where monsters continually attack the castle from all sides.  Monsters are added with a chit-pull system.  Battle is handled through cards with a color coded and section system.  If the castle completely falls you lose.  The mechanics are simple yet elegant.  

But don't let the simplicity of the game fool you.  The game is rather difficult to beat.  The random nature of the game makes planning the defense of the castle impossible in the long term.  Players must handle each situation as it arises.  This is where players use the tool available to them to redraw cards and trade cards to mount the best defense each turn.  This forces the players to work together and really brings out the cooperative nature of the game.

I really enjoy the cooperative game play, but the game does have a slight element of competitiveness to it as well though.  While the players must work together for victory, the one player that fights and kills the most is the true winner.  For me this confuses the game.  I do not like when games are both cooperative and competitive.  A game should be one or the other, not both.  I take out the competitive part of the game and play fully cooperatively.  The players either win or lose as a team.  This makes the game much smoother.

The theme works well for the mechanics in the game.  It really elands itself to the environment.

The components are all nice.  The artworks cartoony, but well done.  Nothing extravagant here, just straight forward and workable.

The game is easy to learn and teach.  The rules are well written.  It is a great introductory game for new gamers, but still offers enough strategy to seasons gamers.



Pros - 
- Easy to teach and learn
- Simple mechanics that offer good strategy
- Difficult enough to keep you playing 


Cons - 
- Cooperative and competitive game play confuses the game.

[thing=104590][/thing] is the first expansion for Castle Panic.  

The Wizard's Tower adds to the game without detracting anything.  That is important for a good expansion.

And that is exactly what The Wizard's Tower is - a very good expansion.  

This expansion brings new, more powerful, monsters to the mix.  It also adds Mega Boss Monsters.  These are monsters that bend the rules a little and make the game more difficult.

The players get a second deck of cards to aid them in the fight.  These are Wizard Cards, or spells, that bring new powers to the players.  These cards are powerful and greatly help the players in the defense of the castle.

What makes this expansion so good is that the game remains perfectly balanced with the addition of the new monsters and Wizard Cards.  The power curve has not been thrown off in any way.  That is a true testament to the beauty of the design of this game.

I would say that not only it this expansion fantastic, it is the best way to play the game.

Adding The Wizard's Tower does change the score a bit

[thing=140681][/thing] is a single card expansion.  

It is exactly as the name says.  It is a Hero that can be used in any color arc.

Since the game runs in sets of 3's, I use 3 of these in the game.  Basically, all the other fighter type cards are in sets of 3, so I think this should be too.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


[thing=133814][/thing] is another single "card" expansion.  Except it is on a coaster.

The Crossbow adds a decent single-use power to the players, but it is done is a silly manner - on a coaster. 

Giving one to each player prior to game start is a nice addition.

[thing=106158][/thing] is another single "card" expansion.  Except it is on a bookmark.

The Feather adds a decent single-use power to the players, but it is done is a silly manner - on a bookmark.

[color=#CC0000]  

My kids had almost zero interest when I got it at Christmas.  I'm planning to bring it out again after a cooling off period, but I think for the most part they didn't feel like they were an important part of the play.  There's two things that fundamentally rub against each other in its concept -- 

1.  All are one.  There's no guy on the board that represents [u]you[/u].  Branham's Razor ("this is me, these are mine") is violated and I think my two seven-year-olds didn't feel connected because of it.  My nine-year-old just seemed bored.

2.  The decisions are pretty simplistic.  There's generally an obvious greatest-need on the board and likely one best way to address it, so you trade your cards away to whomever needs them most and it's as likely as not that's not your decision to make.  This is true "multi-player solitaire" -- everyone agrees on how to solve the puzzle.

The advanced rules put a bit of interest into the game as they allow you to be greedy, but fundamentally they don't provide enough pressure on the concepts I just described above.  When we played my kids kept track of the kill-count, and that just made things worse because they were trading cards away to help someone else (a brother no less).  Not making the trade likely meant group failure.  That didn't appear much fun to them either.

I was very excited on the game when I heard about it and it got some great reviews from adults.  Alas, like more than a few kids games on the market, the ones that got good reviews from adults got very different reviews from my kids.  Likely I'll trade this one away.  A shame really, it seems like such a nice package.

When you want light and fluffy co-op this is pretty neat. I enjoy a lot of the design decisions, the way the baord is divided into zones and rings, rotating the enemies to represent reduced hp. But ultimately it lacks a lot of depth. It's a decent way to introduce the idea of co-op gameplay to people, but falls short in terms of actual decision making or strategy.

great to play with my kids, a kind of game I don't play all that often...the genre of co-op where you won't lose, but you might not do as well as your fellow players. a far cry from my fave co-ops where you die early and often--my kids hate those (R. Crusoe, Knizia's LotR, Ghost Stories, etc). 

very light, and somewhat boring, but not so bad overall. an acceptable way to kill some time with kids.

This is like playing the Atari game [i]Space Invaders[/i], but instead of being attacked by alien spaceships, players are under siege in a castle fighting against hordes of monsters that keep coming and coming. It is nice as a cooperative game, but the mechanic of a winner between winners doesn't work at all here since creatures appear randomly, not necesary in the spots that you need, and there is not much control about what you can do in order to get points if you are not lucky, except exchange cards with other players. Then, well played, this will turn the game in a points transaction one. No one would ever give a card if he doesn't get a potential point in exchange, and no one will ever trade with whoever is in the lead. In fact, there is a chance that nobody ever exchange a card with anybody. And, since that could happen, then the game becomes a lottery, in which the surprise would be if the players are able to survive. So, [i]Castle Panic[/i] has to be played with the right attitude: Master Slasher, ok, but not to be taken seriously. Just relax, enjoy, have fun and slash some monsters, because life is just two days. And this is not because I'm not a "not so cooperative" kind of gamer. I like a lot [i]Cutthoat Caverns[/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=320&Itemid=1]Terra[/url][/i], and the idea of colaborate thinking in the moment to backstab your partners. I even like this mechanic in other games, like [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&Itemid=1]Arkham Horror[/url][/i] and [i]Defenders of the Realm[/i], but here it just doesn't fit.

Love this game.  It's one of my son's favorites, he loves pulling the monsters out of a coffee cup and seeing which ones we need to take down to survive.  Looking at getting the Wizard's Tower expansion to liven things up a little down the line.

Every time I play Castle Panic I feel like it's a nail-biting experience. Walls fall within the first couple of rounds, we are constantly terrified of monsters getting past the walls and into the castle ring, and God forbid the dragon comes out (in the Wizard Tower expansion) and starts blasting fire everywhere.

Honestly, I really enjoy this game. It's easy to learn and simple to play. It's a great filler game when you're looking for something that won't take too much time or energy. And it's good fun when collaborating with your friends to figure out how on earth you're going to survive the next wave of monsters.

Though the board and box art are lacking, the rest of the art is solid and the orc and goblin fantasy theme works well as a setup to the gameplay. Ultimately the game is worth keeping in your collection as a solid, but light, collaborative experience for your game night.

RATING: 7
This is a great game to play with kids.  It is easy to learn and yet provides a number of interesting tactical decisions.  The cooperative aspect is especially fun with kids.  I like watching them plot out the monster courses and make decisions about what trades will be best and help people on the current turn through 1 or 2 turns ahead.  My 8 year old can play without any help and, in fact, offers some really good advice.  This is a definite winner in the family game category.  It also has a very reasonable play time of around 45 minutes and has a built in mechanism to give the game a definite ending point.

A terrific "tower-defense" game, in kid-friendly clothing.  Plays very well, semi-quickly and has enough room for houserules and variants to keep it replayable.  We usually play with the Wizard's Tower expansion now which is practically required.

RATING: 5.79
A tower defense co-op board game that really shines with the addition of The Wizard's Tower expansion that makes the game a little more of a gamers game. Good game particularly with kids or new players without the expansion and very good co-op game for gamers with it.
Recommended for 2+ players.

RATING: 6
This co-operative game has the ease of play of Pandemic but the tension of Ghost Stories.  The art style is not so great, but it is fun.  I have only played co-operative and I am interested in trying the normal game that adds a competitive element as well.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very light semi-cooperative game that could be easily played with non-gamers and 10 yo-ish children.
The game is mostly random but has nice bluff elements.

Much too chaotic and too much downtime with 6 players, it's best played up to 4 players.

Played once, 2p... the system seemed easy, but I suspect with people being more greedy it would be harder. I don't see why the cards aren't private information though - sure it's supposed to be cooperative, but I could just see this happening:

"Sorry man, I don't have a Green Knight..."

next turn: "Dude, I just drew this Green Knight, I swear!"

An interesting take on the increasingly popular cooperative game, this time set in a castle surrounded by a forest full of monsters.  In one sense, this game has a feel similar to Ghost Stories, with a constant onrush of bad guys never giving you a break.  Unfortunately, all you do is play the cards you draw (and trade in a limited fashion) to defend the castle.  It lacks the movement with resulting choices of action from the previously mentioned game, which is something of step backward.  For the most part, you play every card you can every turn.  There are a few interesting tactical decisions to be made, which saves the game from absolute tedium.  I in general have a concern with any cooperative game that can be defeated by four newbies the first time through.  That does not bode well for future plays.

I think this would particularly work with younger players or those with less experience in the recent amazing crop of cooperative games.  This game really pales in comparison to that group.  Five years ago, things might have been different, though.  The other saving grace for the game is that there are multiple alternative rulesets included in the game, which may redeem the easy win we experienced.  So, the final verdict is that it is a pleasant enough distraction, but nothing I'm ever going to seek out. [01/13/2010]

Mostly harmless. It's a simple co-op suitable for young boys who need this sort of theme. Not as clever as pandemic, some weird graphic design decisions (I don't like the look of the board), but it does have a simple narrative that makes you interested in the game. 

The competitive part just doesn't make any sense (if you seriously want to win, then you won't trade cards, but then you can all lose), play it just like a normal co-op. It's tough enough as it is.

Very good as a light game. Theme is ok, not too exciting, but also does not feel extremely pasted on.
I doubt it stands up to long time replayability, but as a light game among friends its good. Alcohol can be had and it still will be playable. A longish filler really.
The game works very good with up to six people playing - that is quite a feature!
The solo version is fun for a few times.

Man I just finished the first playthough with this game and I gotta say, I'm super impressed. I didn't have my expectations super high---I just thought it would be on the cool side of 'decent'. We played with 6 castle heroes, and myself as the Overlord as we had 7 people over. It was super close the entire game through, and the heroes only barely just won with one tower left (and the next turn would have resulted in it toppling down). We all had a fantastic time and are excited to play again next week! Highly recommend.

I had a surprisingly fun time playing this game. Note that so far I have played cooperative, which is my favorite game mode. I like the feeling of dread as the forces close in from all around you. Game brings a lot of laughs and promotes good strategy to work out subsequent turns actions with fellow players. I'd rate it higher, but it's weighted a little much towards luck... all depending on what cards you draw (less so) and what monster chips you draw (more so).

1 play, 3er.

A very simple, somewhat bland semi-cooperative game (with variant rules to play full-coop, or 1-vs-many). Probably fun with non-gamers, but just wasn't terribly interesting.

--- Summary ---
The board is a set of 4 rings (forest, archer, knight, swordsman) with the castle in the center (6 towers protected by 6 walls), divided into 3 color zones (red, blue, green) and 6 wedges. Seed the board by placing 3 goblins (1HP), 2 orcs (2HP), and 1 troll (3HP) in the forest ring. On your turn, first draw cards up to hand limit (5). Then, optionally discard 1 and draw 1. Then, optionally trade 1 card with a player. Next, play cards from hand: most allow you to attack in a particular color/ring, doing 1 HP damage. Others modify attack, or allow you to rebuild destroyed wall, or other special effect. If you kill a monster, keep it as a trophy. Next, all remaining monsters advance one ring inward; if already at center circle, they move clockwise. If a monster hits a wall or tower, they destroy it and take 1HP damage. Finally, one at a time, draw 2 random monster tiles: if a monster, roll d6 and place in forest of appropriate wedge; if a special tile, resolve as needed (some move monsters inward, some around the board, etc.).

If all towers destroyed, players lose the game. If all 49 monsters are killed, the player with the best trophy collection (each is worth VP = HP of monster) wins.

I'm hesitant to bad-mouth this game because it was a gift from a well-meaning friend who knew I wanted more cooperative games but it just simply isn't my cup of tea.

Castle panic is a VERY simple cooperative game where monsters move along concentric tracks outside your castle each turn in an attempt to breach your castle walls.  Each player takes a turn playing cards that attack these enemies, repair walls, or deploy their own sentries to stop the onslaught.  The goal is to survive the invasion.

There's just not much to this game to hold a group of adults attention unless they really are after a simpler game.  You can trade cards with your fellow players to deploy them at the most opportunistic moment but other than that there aren't many interesting choices to be made.  You choose what cards to play but most of the time those decisions are obvious.

The components, especially the 3D walls, are nice.  And as a family game to play with children this is a good gateway.  Not for a group of adults with discerning gaming tastes though.

Nice cooperative game that is a tower defense. This game really needs the expansion Wizard's Tower to be more of a challenge. Like most cooperative games, this game is prone to having alpha player. I liked it as a solo game too.

I super duper love this game. It's quite simple, which just means that it's a great pick up and play game for newer players and older players alike. The RNG is usually not awful, though some games it can completely screw a player over, but the game is designed to be slightly forgiving even when the RNG isn't, and I would overall say that I quite enjoy it.

Nicely produced, easy to play. Lacks tension, too luck driven. A bit repetative. Card play is programmed. Might be better withmore players or in overlord mode.

I think it will work well with children age 9 - 10. 

Pandemic so much better (even though i don't like Pandemic....)

Feels like there is a good idea in here just not this game

Not sure if this is the original tower defense game, but it certainly exemplifies the genre.  Card-driven defense, with token-driven attacks and a very simple A.I.  Some of the randomness of the game makes it difficult to plan ahead, although the predictability (usually) of enemy movement means that you can optimize strategy through trading cards with other players.  I have yet to play at higher than a two-player count.

This is a fantastic game to play with kids. It's easy to teach, and the theme is a lot of fun. The decisions are mostly pretty simple--probably too trivial if playing with just adults--but there's just enough to think through that it doesn't feel as if the game is playing you.

We find the game pretty easy to beat with the basic rules, so we always draw 3 monsters per turn. Using this variant, our endings are almost always very close and tense, just as a co-op game should be. It also has the added bonus of making the game a little shorter, which is helpful when playing with kids.

This is the type of game I would have LOVED when I was a young lad!  In fact, if my wee one was older than 3 weeks of age, I'd purchase this in a second.  But being a crotchety old 33-year old, I don't find it to be the most compelling game.  It did instill a few moments of PANIC, but not a huge amount of excitement.  Mind you, I was playing with a couple of young kids, so we didn't pull out all the interesting critters.  The production values of the game are top notch - the artwork is very fun and I particularly enjoy the castle walls.  It's a very well put-together game that is a great co-operative experience for kids, and adults might enjoy it too if they're looking for a bit of low mental energy fun.  I was trying to think if it might fit best within the "filler" category for adults, but I think there are games that suit that purpose much better.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6/10

Ok, this game can be quite challenging. It relies quite heavily on luck and can be quite random that way. Eliminating unusable cards from your hand is difficult and can leave you looking at only 1 or 2 new cards every turn. We nearly lost because both of us found ourselves in that predicament near the end of the first play. It's not a bad game by any means, it's just on a lower level than many others.

Good theme play.  Easy to learn and play.  Game is a bit deeper than first glance and players must work together well to win.  Components are good - colorful mounted board, cardboard chits and plastic stands.  Cards are somewhat durable with fair artwork.  Rulebook is colorful and well written.  Game length is about 1 hour, which feels right.

So fun! A great, light family cooperative game that I'm very happy to have in my collection. The decisions aren't terribly taxing -- mostly you just make do with what you have. There is drama and tension, but frankly it's the "watching the game happen to you" kind of tension and not so much the "am I making the right decision?" kind of tension. But if you have kids (or if you are a big kid) then I recommend giving this game a shot. Full of shouts and groans...my kinda game!

Picked this up for $20 on Amazon and figured it would be good for my 6yo and I to co-op. It's really straightforward and just slightly boring for her.

I've heard the expansions offer more challenge, but there are so many other great games out there that I'm not sure I want to sink any money in. Not a bad game, just okay....

I originally bought this for my son when he was around 8.  He didn't like it because it felt like the best play was too easy to see.  I was going to trade it but my 4 year old wanted to play (she can with a little help) and it turns out she likes it.

A lot of people said that adding the expansion helps to give the players more options and increase the difficulty.  We have played twice with the expansion and it does make it more challenging and interesting.

My son has to be "forced" to play it with his younger sister but I really enjoy it with her.

Castle Panic can be fun, but most of the enjoyment comes from the players.  The game is almost pointlessly random, with few or no choices to make.  The 'master slayer' rule is best ignored, as it does nothing but cause confusion. I will give this a nod for being good when you want a mindless relaxing game, which is occasionally desired.

Holy Vanilla, Batman!  This is the most vanilla and themeless game I've ever played.  It's a fine game, but the "theme" is more tacked on than anything I've ever played.  It's a really ugly presentation.

Otherwise, it's a fine little co-op that's tense and seems really tough to win.  I'd play it again, but I'd rather play a co-op with some theme like Yggdrasil, Pandemic, or Defenders of the Realm.

The idea of having to work co-operatively to protect the castle whilst trying to hold back cards at the right time to ensure you score the most points at the end is a wonderful idea, but I'm not sure it really works here for me.

Castle Panic is a very simple coop survival game.  I love the concept, and when I saw it on Will Wheaton's tabletop I knew I wanted a copy.  At the time I would have guessed this would rank a 9 or 10 on my list, but everytime I play it I generally like it less and less.  I think it gets a bit old because it is simple color matching and basic play order logic that plays out the same round after round.

Overall, it is a good simple coop game, but I feel like it has a bit less replayability than other coops out there.

Update: I see there are expansions for this, that might improve replay-ability, if so I will update and it might raise this to an 8

I think a lot of people go into Castle Panic thinking it's going to be a tower defense game like the online Flash stuff. The thing is that those games have high casualty counts, scaling damage, cool effects you can upgrade into, and so forth. Castle Panic has "Did anyone draw the right color this round? Well, fuck."

However, for kids it's wonderful for those reasons, definitely something I will play when I have kids of my own : )

Really fun cooperative (or solo) "tower defence" type game. Fairly simple with just the base game, suitable for families.

Highly recommended.

Fantastic game!  I have recommended this for people looking for a fun co-op game.  It can even be played solo.  The setup takes a little bit of time (well, maybe not for experienced game players), but the gameplay is easy and well-paced.  Setup between games isn't bad.

Okay game. Quite good fun at first, but there is very little strategic choice here, but it is well balanced whether you all manage to kill the monsters or not, so from that point of view it works.

RATING: 5.5
I like this co-op to teach beginners slightly more than Forbidden Island due to its more straight-forward rules. However, the problem is that there's not a lot of tension here; anyone with even a little experience can win this easily most of the time, and there's no way to change the difficulty level. It's not a bad game, and it's pretty amusing with the right group of people. The castle set-up is neat and the concept's intriguing. But I could only recommend getting this if you have or play with younger children often, or as a gateway co-op game with non-gamers. Oh, and the master slayer rules are not any good to play with, so skip those and just use it as a pure co-op.

Played a full game. The game is okay but it does not have an "arc" at all, just you get what you get. Missing the climax of the best coops like Forbidden Island and Pandemic. Also, you can get beat just by all drawing red zone monsters b/c that happened to me twice.
I was able to easily teach kids under 10 and let them borrow the game to play on their own.

Played copy with friends visiting and their 5 year old. It was a hit and they bought us a copy. I love the art style and the simple gameplay so far. I printed the official and unofficial variants to put in the box.

Light cooperative game, with some slight competition. The master slayer competition keeps it from turning into the usual co-op with one player telling everyone what to do. The base game is pretty bland, however, so I wouldn't recommend playing this without the wizard's tower.

This is one of those games that should not be as much fun as it is.  For one thing, it basically plays itself at times due to the tile draw.  You can strategize, trade, wrangle, whatever.  But when it comes down to it, a terrible tile draw can decide the game very early.

However, it is easy to teach, plays quick enough, and moves along rapidly--provided someone does not try to hijack the game.  I enjoy it, and even got my uncle to play twice--and he probably hadn't touched a boardgame in at least 30 years.

This is one of the better cooperative games I've played, along with Forbidden Island.
Even when you lose, you really do feel like you were pretty close to beating the game if it weren't for those few unlucky moments, which makes you want to play again.

Bought this for the "castle defense" style of gameplay. Wife and I enjoyed this from the very start. Easy to pickup and learn and scales well with 2 to 4 players. 

Draw and hand of cards, play them to defeat aproaching monsters and defend your castle before they break through the walls.

This was a game that the more we play it, the more we enjoy it. Recently purchased the wizards tower expansion and looking forward to increasing the difficulty!

Only played with Wizard's Tower.
Great 'tower defense' game.  Takes longer than it says with every group I've played it with, but people tend to puzzle it out.  Either way, it's a really fun game that constantly feels like you'll lose (which I love in a coop) without actually being impossible.

RATING: 2
Wow - I think this has to be a 2.  I really don't think you could convince me to play this again.  I don't see how this is a cooperative game if I'm hoping to score more than my neighbors.  There was [u]no[/u] tension in the game and no opportunity to plan.  While not broken at all, this was completely unengaging.

This [i]might[/i] be palatable with 3 players, as long as one or more of them were small children (say four- or five-year-olds).  As a kid's (only) game, this might be alright.

I won't be playing it again unless invited by a grandchild (my only child is 11, so I have a while before I have to think about how to tactfully avoid that possibility).

I'm not generally a fan of cooperative games as I prefer to compete against individual people rather than against algorithms. That said, this is one of the better co-ops I've played. I prefer it over Forbidden Island primarily because I like the idea of killing monsters over shoring up land against flooding. My daughter is of the opposite opinion as she found the onward march of monsters very stressful.

Another co-operative game, and if you look at my collection you'll see a lot of them. This one is easier than many of the other co-op games on the list. But I like the tower defense feel to this game and the artwork fits the feel and weight of the game well. I wish that it were a bit more challenging (and sometimes it really is very challenging), as I've won quite often, but it's one that I'd breakout with people who haven't played it before, because it's very easy to learn.

RATING: 5
A pretty game with an highly interesting "tower" defense theme. It appeals to most players and is easy to get to.

Despite its simple rules, it manages to create sufficient agony to the players and does have meaningful, if realatively easy, decisions to make. It generally keeps you well on your toes, as it should be.

The result is in the end a bit luck dependant due to the luck of the draw, but not so much that it is spoiling the game. Although the game appears to be best as a co-op, I think this is deceiving. There are tons of better coops out there, though few are a match in theme. I believe this game shines in overlord mode.

In the end what wins the day for me is the different playing modes. A two player overlord game (that I play against my wife) is an entirely different experience than a 5 player full co-op for example. And there is the default master slayer variant that seems a bit strange and I've yet to try it.

This game hits the table at a pace I never expected when I bought it.

I went to BGG.CON with a list of over 100 games that I wanted to try, knowing that I'd never get to most of them. On the plane ride down to Dallas I was watching a new Board Games with Scott episode about Castle Panic, a game I'd never heard of previously, and that video alone convinced me to get out a pen and write Castle Panic into the extra small margins of my "games to try" list. Unlike most of the games on that list, I actually did get to try Castle Panic thankfully. I played with James, Lisa, and Brian, and I had a great time. I've been on the fence about whether to buy the game ever since. It's a cooperative game, and the fact that I already own and enjoy Ghost Stories, Pandemic, and Red November cuts both ways - on the one hand I might not need another cooperative game, but on the other hand I clearly like and enjoy cooperative games (and play them a lot given my 93 combined plays of the aforementioned three games). Castle Panic is simpler though, much simpler. It's actually so straightforward in terms of its gameplay that I think it only truly shines because of its competitive element. The players are theoretically working together to kill monsters that are slowly marching towards and destroying their walls and towers. However, like Krakow 1325 AD and Peter Hawes' upcoming War of the Roses, there is an undercurrent (or rip tide depending on who you're playing with) of selfish subterfuge. The player who individually kills the most monsters is named the "Master Slayer" (said best in a grandiose Scott Nicholson voice). I suppose it's up to the group how they want to interpret the "Master Slayer" appellation, but I personally think the game would thrive best by considering that person the sole winner. It injects into an otherwise overly simplistic game a wonderful element of tension and interaction. The players can't quite trust each other to always work for the good of the team rather than the good of themselves and thus won't take the optimal path to group victory by freely trading cards, but rather may horde them. You walk a dangerously fine line though because too much selfishness will cause everyone to lose and then nobody gets to be the "Master Slayer."

It is coop which falls outside my definition of a game.  However, I did buy it for and play it with my nephew who was absolutely thrilled.  He grabbed every family member he could to join him.  Had games going the entire time we were together.  If he is still playing at that rate, his parents will hate me.

A simple, cooperative game requiring players to trade cards to best hold off waves of goblins, orcs and trolls trying to destroy your castle.  If the castle is destroyed, the game wins.  Otherwise, the player who gets the most points gained by striking the killing blow on the monsters wins the title of "Master Slayer".  Not enough interesting choices for my taste, i.e. too light/simple.

Had a chance to playtest this in 2008 and couldn't get a seat.  Glad it got published.  My first play was a 4-player game, and for a cooperative game to have an MVP for killing monsters, there seems to be a disconnect between wanting to get the group win and becoming the MVP.  My score was less than half of everybody else's simply because I almost always had cards that everybody else needed and couldn't use myself.  Will have to see if there's a way to mitigate that.

Castle Panic isn't a game I knew anything about, other than having it heard called a kid's game.  So I wasn't really seeking it out.  I lucked into a copy of it with the Wizard's Tower expansion.  It was a big hit with my son.

I enjoyed it.  It wasn't the deepest game ever but it has enough going on to be interesting.  And I think the expansion, which we haven't played yet, may make it even better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played [thing=43443][/thing] together with the expansion [thing=104590][/thing], which I was told adds several elements to the base game, such as the named Wizard Tower, a deck of spells for the defenders, new creatures - some legendary - and some new effects; all of which make the game a whole lot better. The goal of the game remains the same: defend the fortress (walls and towers), while hordes of monsters come to attack it.

A player turn is pretty simple: first, draw cards until there are 5 in hand. Then is allowed to discard 1 card to draw another; and also trade cards with other players. Then, is possible to use as many cards as the player want - and most will attack the monsters, but several, specially when considering the spells deck, will have some neat effects. Normal attacks will cause 1 point of damage, and if the creature loses its last hit point, it leaves the board. Is important to know that the board is divided in sections (by colors - green, red and blue) and rings (by type of defender - archer, knight and swordsman - that can attack such place, plus the forest, where the creatures usually can't be hit) - so, for instance, a Red Archer will only be able to do damage to a creature in the red section in the archer ring. After the players uses his cards, the creatures on the board move (usually 1 space) in the direction of the fortress. If a one of them hits the walls, they take 1 damage and the wall is removed. If is a tower that is hit, the same happens, and once inside the walls, the creature start to move clockwise, destrying tower after tower, and only some special defenders cards can attack a creature inside the fortress, so be careful! Finally, 2 tokens are drawn from the bag (these can be new creatures or effects, like attacks from trebuchets and boulders, plagues, and so on) - if one or more of them are creatures, for each the player rolls a die, and puts the token in the corresponding place in the board, in the forest ring. Then, is the next player turn.

The game goes like this until the creatures destroy all the towers (keep the walls doesn't matter) or until the defenders kill all the of them (even after all the tokens in the bag were drawn, still is necessary to kill all that are on the board, threatening the fortress). In the first case, as expected, the players lose, in the second, players win. I know the game can be played competitively, but we didn't and, though I'm aware it enters in a semi-cooperative sort of game, in which everyone wins, but one is the win-est - this is not something I enjoy in games, with traitors I'm fine, but with "one win more" in coops, no, just no.

[thing=43443][/thing] counts, specially with the expansion, several effects coming from the enemies in order to breath some uneasiness, as the defenders can't really be sure, during the game (near the end, is possible), to know exactly what will be coming and when. Several creatures have special actions when they are drawn or in other moments (for instance, the Hydra, when hit, spawn new monsters; the Manticore, when it moves, it spits fire into the fortress; the Healer, when revealed, heals 1 point of damage of all the wounded creatures on the board; the Conjurer, when revealed, brings with him 1d6 Imps; and there are several others). The defenders, of course, also have special cards in their decks (both in the normal and in the Wizard deck), and with the spells they can cast fireballs, walls of force, hammers of light, chains of lighting, teleport, rains of ice, etc.

[thing=43443][/thing] showed itself as a better game than I expected it to be. What I read about it wasn't really all that good, but is likely that what brought the "surprise" for me was the expansion. Anyway, I was expecting a more childish tower defense cooperative game, with some pretty obvious decisions throughout, but, luckly, this wasn't the case (though, sometimes, the decisions is obvious, but not all the time).

[thing=43443][/thing] has its doses of luck, in the draw of the deck, in the draw of creatures and in the roll of the die to place them. But its main point is fixed: all the normal attacks, if able to hit, cause 1 point of damage - there is no chance of missing nor of not dealing damage. So, if a creature is on the board, it is possible to predict its advancement and strategize the best way to deal with it. And this is important to resist in some places and against some monsters. Also, the trading of cards is key in the game, and is the part that is really the cooperative in the game. This is true for simple situations like "Anyone has a Blue Knight, for me to kill that creature?" to some slightly more complex: "If I move this one together with that one, and toss some Tar in this one, I can trade this card with so in your turn you can use it when they are in the Swordsman ring to destroy both".

The components are good and functional, but nothing really pops (not a joke about the 3D towers and walls) too much, for good or bad. The art is well done and is made by the designer of the game, Justin De Witt, a talented guy.

So, overall, I enjoyed [thing=43443][/thing], as it has a nice level of challenge, and is possible, because of its easy rules, to be put quickly in the table and be played with groups ranging from kids to the veteran players (but, here, probably only really worth if adding the expansion). But I wasn't wowed by it, since I got to know much better cooperative games, with more meat and fun build into the gameplay - but most of these takes more time to be played. Anyway, I'm certainly willing to play [thing=43443][/thing] again, though I won't actively be looking for it.

I find it is always useful to have some cooperative games in my collection. There are always people who feel more comfortable playing with everyone, rather than against anyone. This one is the simplest of the cooperative games I own. Is is simpler than Arkham Horror, Pandemic, even Red November. That makes it a very good choice for people new to the hobby. I am not sure if I enjoy it, but I enjoy the fact that others do. That is good enough for me.

The forest is filled with all sorts of Monsters. They watched and waited as you built your Castle and trained your soldiers, but now they‚Äôve gathered their army and are marching out of the woods.

Can you work with your friends to defend your Castle against the horde, or will the Monsters tear down your Walls and destroy the precious Castle Towers? You will all win or lose together, but in the end only one player will be declared the Master Slayer!

Castle Panic is a fantastic game to play with kids or non-gamer adults. With the expansion it's even better, but the base game is still quite fun. I enjoy the feeling of encroaching doom as your walls and towers get whittled down in numbers, sending out your men in a desperate attempt to repel the invaders. Although I agree the base game does tend to be on the easy side, most times.

RATING: 7
A good game. Cooperative which means that you typically end up in the coop conundrum - the smartest and most outspoken person at the table rules the roost.  Fun and Iike the random bit of surprise the drawing from the bag yields.

RATING: 7
This is a good coop game with a team that just makes the game fun. Great with kids and adults with the expansions.

RATING: 6
Much better than I thought. Would be great for non-gamers. Kind of the feel that Shadows over Camelot without the traitor.

*** Update ***
The game seems to suffer from 'the journey to the Shire' syndrome. You know, the action is all finished but you've got another 100 pages to end the book because we need to get everyone home and strings wrapped up. Once you survive the initial surge, the game is pretty predictable.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoy this game a lot yet it just isn't getting played as much I thought it might.  It's just too easy to win and repetitive for us.  Also, when 6 players were present, it dragged on too much between turns.  However, this is quite fun with children.

My kids fell in love with this game after one play at a local board game cafe.  We ended up leaving with a copy for home.  Fun, co-operative game.  I have had a resurgence in plays of this game as it has become popular with my casual gaming friends.

Rating is for the base game. Add the Wizard's Tower and the rating skyrockets. 

The base game is a very simple co-op that you can teach to neighbor kids. Add the expansion and the difficulty ratchets up several notches.

Castle Panic might be a perfect introductory cooperative game. It is easy to learn and ideal for families with children. The board makes the objective perfectly clear, and the way the monsters' march toward the castle creates real tension. I don't play this one as often as I once did, but it paved my way to more complex and exciting games.

RATING: 8
Fantastic little players vs the board coop game. The one gripe myself and others have had is that there is no way to defend your castle once baddies enter the inner ring. I have resolved that by creating the following house rule: Heroes can defend the castle!!! Fun times!

I wasn't sold on this game in the first place, as it sounds and looks a bit too simple. But as I was looking for a cooperative family game, I finally bought a copy and now Castle Panic is one of our favourite games! While the rules are simple and can be learned/taught in just a few minutes, the battles can be heated and cause actual panic :)
If you are looking for a cooperative game you can play with your kids 7+, you should definitely have a look at Castle Panic!

I love the chaotic feel that's driven by the mechanic of flipping over two random monster tiles at the end of each turn, and by the dice rolls. You can have a great plan that gets ruined by having to rotate the monsters, or by having an unlucky dice roll that causes a boulder to go rolling through the only lane that you really didn't want it to roll through. A fun, lighter co-op game that plays well with 2 players.

So dull, and so basic. I can see where this would be fun for kids, but I was not impressed, and I had high hopes for the game prior to playing it. I won't trade it away because I am sure Rilyn will like it when she is older, but until then, it will sit on the shelf.

RATING: N/A
Simple co-op (or semi co-op). Play your cards to deal damage to the bad guys in various quadrants and distances, the bad guys move forward and attack your castle if not eliminated. I liked the hand management and trading aspect, as you decided which cards to keep, which ones to trade to other players so that certain monsters could be eliminated when it got to their turn. It was fun as a problem solving co-op, the competitive aspects of the game held no interest for me. As the game wound down, I knew that technically I should stop trading with one player, and let the monster attack the castle, so that I'd win. But, I passed him the card, he killed the final monster, and "won" the game. I rejoiced in our shared victory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Brainless co-op game that keeps you busy but doesn't ever stimulate the grey matter. Theme is fine and difficulty is well-judged, but there's not really enough game here for me. Lucky enough to draw the right cards? Congratulations! At least it's relatively short.

Played with five players today. Keep the rating at 7. Its easy with more players. Perhaps with the wizard tower expansion it will be harder and make the score go up for me. Was fun though. Will update for the last time when I use the wizard tower.

15-8-2014 *update 2*
Played it with my girlfriend for the first time. I liked it better than the solo experience but I think with 3 or more its even nicer. With 2 players you can start planning the defense of the castle which you cant when you play solo. I rate this game 7 now for the 2 player experience.

31-7-2014 *UPDATE*
Had some spare time and decided to play a solo game. The first rounds went well. I even had times when there were none or only a few monsters on the board. I thought 'this is going to be easy'. I was wrong. I forgot about the bosses and the ''draw monster tokens''. At one point monsters were advancing from 5 out of 6 arcs and I drew most of the trolls at the last rounds. In the end I lost with 1 wall standing up and 5 monsters left on the board. Nice solo experience I have to say. Curious how it plays with a group. I Think the interaction will only bring this game to a higher level. For now I rate this game a 6.5. Will update again when I play this with 4 or up which will be next sunday.

Got this in the mail today. After reading so much about it I decided to order it. Haven't played it yet but I will next sunday. Will update this comment after play. Components and artwork look very nice.

The forest is filled with all sorts of Monsters. They watched and waited as you built your Castle and trained your soldiers, but now they‚Äôve gathered their army and are marching out of the woods.

Can you work with your friends to defend your Castle against the horde, or will the Monsters tear down your Walls and destroy the precious Castle Towers? You will all win or lose together, but in the end only one player will be declared the Master Slayer!

Castle Panic is a cooperative, light strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up.
\13\\13\
Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest, at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win.

Great family game. Played with 4 adults and two children. Won the game with 2 towers left. Was almost an easy win right up until the end, until a troll broke through into the castle ring and played havoc with a couple of towers!

Castle Panic is an interesting and fairly simple game. There is challenge to it and it would make for a fun, family co-op game. Where it seems to suffer is in variety and replayability. I feel that CP would get old fairly quickly since nothing about the game (except the order in which monsters appear) really changes. Not a bad game but not a terribly deep one either and it does seem to take a bit longer than I would prefer for what it is.

Pretty straight forward tower defense game.  Every other player had played before and pretty much ran my turns.  Pretty cool concept but the fun was diminished because of the the way the game was ran.

This is such a great tower defense game, and a lot of fun for 2-6 players. There's even a solitaire option, which extends the playability and is even fun to spectate! The random "monster draw" mechanic keeps it interesting (and frustrating), and I wish the designers would've included a black velvet "bag of doom" for people to draw from. We created our own, and it adds to the ambiance of the game - plus, it makes it easier to pass to each player during their turn. I'm really excited about the Wizards Tower and Dark Titan expansions. I think either will be a great addition to an already exciting and unpredictable game.

Edit: Back to the dusty shelf it went after one play. I feel like I'm missing something with this one but no one in the family enjoys it.

A great cooperative game for families. A bit easy with just the base game (gamers just cycled the deck quickly to get the barbarian/scavenge combo to clear out the big monsters). The 1st expansion made harder and gave more options. Could be a bit anti-climatic at the end, but there are great moments of panic (and cheering for the lucky boulder rolls). The other expansions after that added more variety and challenge too.

What you can do is completely dependent on which cards you draw, and the correct plays are glaringly obvious once you actually have the proper cards.

Strike One: Castle Panic isn't great - or anything close.

Strike Two:  The game is only half-cooperative, in that the evil forces can be vanquished through equal contribution of labor - yet the "winner" happens to be the person who landed the most finishing blows.  In a "we all deserve to die" suicide run like Terra, that's fine; but in a family game, it's just dumb.

(For those desiring an obscure reference, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game has the same underlying problem: competition where there should be cooperation.)

Strike Three:  Forbidden Island exists, and it's the better family game.

As a social interaction game I found it enjoyable, but ends up being overly repetitive/ boring. Played a dozen times solo, felt like there was something missing.
 hopefully the theme and gameplay in the star trek version fixes this.

If you look up "BGG 6" in the dictionary, it has a picture of Castle Panic. Not great, but definitely not bad, and you can have lots of fun with this, anyway. I feel like there's a really solid game in here somewhere, if it had only been iterated on.

Castle Panic is a great cooperative gateway game. The rules are easy to understand and is light and fun. It's not a party game but is definitely light enough to allow some social interaction throughout the game especially with a moderately experienced gamers.

Update: 05/16/11

Not bad of a game. Fairly simple. Can't shake the idea that the game is for younger ages. The reason being, if played by competitive and logic oriented adults, we'd never defend our castle. We'd just go after the win.

Great co-op game. Very honest name. There is a castle and there is panic. Kind of. Sometimes not. I like the flow of the game, the circular rings are easy to understand and the concept of tower defense is well received. This is gateway game weight and almost everyone I've played it with has loved it. Most games come down to the wire.

Great defense tower game, it¬¥s absolutely essential that you play this game with the expansion (The Wizards Tower) in order to get a more challengin experience, otherwise the game feels rather blunt.

Best play with 2 or 3 players.

A good light game, but a little easy by the standard rules. Feels a little random, and not in a good way. If you house rule in a little more strategy and consequences this game could become great - in short what it needs is an expansion that adds the depth that was missing.

Or just leave it as is, a lightweight family friendly game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My initial assessment that this game would be fun for my family was correct.  The ability to trade cards both to the discard and with another player really adds to the co-op of the game.  My kids really got into the trading aspect by determining which cards would be best for what player at what time.  Of course, drawing monster movement tokens can disrupt those plans.  The random monster tile draws, random monster placement as well as the card draws will ensure an entirely different game each time it is played.  

I don't know if the game is brutal or if we just had bum luck, twice.  While the luck of the draw adds to the replayability, a bum draw could seriously hamper your efforts to defending the castle.  You need cards of both the right color (red, green, and blue) and distance (archer, knights, and swordsman) in order to damage the monsters.  And once they get into the keep, there are very few cards that can affect them.  A renegade monster in the tower without any cards to get him out spells disaster!
 
All-in-all, this is a great family co-op game.  I am sure with some of the more interesting variants it makes a great co-op game for adults as well.

I think this game is great.  It plays very smoothly and has some pretty interesting game mechanics considering how simple the game play is.

I personally do not care for the artwork though.  I think the colors are a little drab and the depictions are not at all very attractive.

Not sure what's to like about this game.  You do everything you can do (almost always), then you do everything you have to do, then it's the next player's turn.

There is not much choice and whether you win or lose usually depends on the draw of the tiles.  Not for me.

In the realm of ‚Äúco-op but not really‚Äù games, I think Castle Panic is one of the ones I like most. I‚Äôm not a fan of that subfamily of games, but with Castle Panic you can ignore the individual victory and go for a pure co-op experience. I have a feeling that some games could get very annoying simply because the cards and tiles turn against you, but my first game was amazing and right down to the wire. I would definitely play this again, although it‚Äôs not on my purchasing list.

A basic cooperative game that works well with a mixed group of seasoned gamers and casual gamers. The components could be better, as could the artwork, but the design itself works well, moves quickly, and leads to some tension. The solo variant is a fun diversion, but the 'master slayer' idea of awarding a single player the win is always either forgotten right away (if the players want to work together) or overpowers the system and breaks it down (if the players are too interested in the win).

Imperfect information maneuver warfare game from Richard Sivel - as good as it gets. More refined than its predecessor, Friedrich. I wish the designer would make more games with his patented Sivelian maneuver-combat system.

Maria is my all-time favorite number one game, hands down.
Maria blends all of my favorite mechanics into a single game with maneuver, bluffing, and diplomatic negotiations. It evokes a great war game feeling: it's much more important here to evade and maneuver than give battle with your opponents which are costly. Interestingly the side who fights the most usually loses the game, and those who lose battles the best (taking only one-hit retreats) usually win. You can definitely win the battle but lose the war in this game It is not uncommon for the winner of the game to only win 20 - 30% of all engagements, while the losers might boast battle winning percentages of 80 to 100%. I've seen several sacrificial attacks as well, where the winner of the game notably sent a general on a suicidal mission to draw in the defenders which freed up his other generals to sprint to objectives and put themselves out of supply. 
The game is wonderfully balanced as well despite any complaints against the Austrians - the Austrians just need to place more emphasis on negotiations and threaten/bluff on the political issues to force their opponents to spend TC on politics. The role of Pragmatic Army-Prussia is brilliant and creates excellent opportunities for collusion and weasely negotiating.

A refreshingly different "euro-wargame" for 3 players. Both the political elements and the combat system works really well, but the latter is too abstract for my liking. Although the rules are easy to learn, the game offers lots of interesting strategic possibilities. This is a game I expect some people will want to play again and again to become very skilled in.

Although the wargamers will likely say just how easy this game is, for euro players there is a pretty steep learning curve. It does come together well once you start playing but there is quite a lot in the rules to get through first time out.

It definitely needs three players who will keep the game moving - too much pondering over movements can slow this down considerably.

RATING: 6
I like the unique and simple game system.

What I don't like, is the lack of dramatic structure. Players just keep pushing back and forth for several hours until an opportunity shows itself and someone seizes it. Normally it wouldn't be a problem but Maria is too long for being one of those games.

Furthermore, the game left a feeling that Austria can't win on its own. It definitely needs political help from the other two players. If no alliance is formed, it's a race between Prussia and France who is the faster one to conquer Austria. If Prussia and France form an alliance, the forementioned race takes place even earlier.

A Great 3 Player game, My first game as prussian was confusing and not at all pleasant because of the schizophrenic role of the prussian. 
The second and subsequent experiences were excelent.

The understanding of the history of the Succession War of Austria helps players immensely to perceive the dynamics of alliances (France-Prussia?) And double plays of the powers involved.

It is remarkable how it was possible to design such a fun and playable game of a so complex military-political conflict.

Another good light 3 player-evening-session-wargame. 

The problems of card draw still persist here as much as Friedrich. It boils down to putting army facing each other at card advantage spots and play cards like a mathematical machine. Any winning or losing boils down to the number of cards and their value. Strategy is based on that. If you have cards, you fight. If not, move away. 

It's not exactly a bad thing. Not much difference if dice are used. But the randomness provides fighting chance. Cards don't. More cards, more value wins. No damage to winning armies. 

The political cards are an interesting sideshow that is helpful if the game drags on to stalemate fronts. Other than that, it's waste to throw cards there at all. Battle games are best with cards at hand. 1 box advancement in political does not equate to 1 lost battle in terms of severity.

The innovative and yet simple systems of Friedrich are translated to a scenario in which the positions of three players are more balanced.  The event cards that were game-changing in Friedrich now have more subtle, cumulative effects.  There is also an interesting system for bidding precious tactical cards for the choice of how to implement events.  All in all, a marvelous game.

The clean, thematic artwork and the component quality of Maria are up to the high standards set by Friedrich.

RATING: 6
Reminds me of early twentieth century wargames. I like it, but doubt that common play cards were a good choice for a wargame of this stature. And then those card color square regions. This should not be ...

More minuses:
* The winner decides where the loser retreats. Even if this makes no sense at all.
* No zones of control. You could easily bypass your enemy.
* Battle casualties should be based on ratio instead of absolute difference. The winner should also take some.
* Main roads have a too high impact on the course of the game.

Hint for the designers:
Play more traditional wargames to get more inspiration. I have the feeling that your game could have been great both in design and simulation.

I thought Friedrich was good - but this is better. On the down side it does rather fill up an afternoon and explaining the rules to a newbie can take a whole hour (yes you did read that right). On the plus side the combat system is exceptionally clever, the political cards are great addition and there can be a certain amount of intrigue and double thinking which are things I enjoy greatly. When do I get to play again?

First play was pretty average with three new players. The most complex game I've had to teach. It was more a game of 'can we get the rules right'. I didn't come away thinking 'that was great' as I'd hoped. Now the dust has settled and I've re-read the rules, I'm thinking this has the potential to be great but needs repeated plays to see this come to fruition. 

After second play it has shown itself to be a good game. We were concentrating less on the rules and more about strategy. I can't see a 3 player war game getting much better than this. The game can run long but it managed to hold my interest for the whole time. Rating moved from a 7 to an 8 and is probably lightly to settle there.

I think it's a significantly better game than Friedrich. More balanced.
The rules are definitely more fiddly, which makes Friedrich an easier game to play more often. But Maria is definitely the better game. In Friedrich, the fact that you could become a small, almost irrelevant country, was a detriment to multiple plays.
I like the fact that Maria does't have that possibility.

Milsims 3/2010. I'm a fan of Friedrich the original game. This has the added advantage of supporting 2 players.

Rating based on one play of the introductory game. Not as nailbiting as Friedrich is my first impression, but we'll see what the advanced game and full mapboard is like before passing further judgement. Components are magnificent, particuarly the cards.

Rating updated to a 9 after play of the advanced game. Very subtle mechanics but some agonising decisions to be made.(Nov 15)

As always in 3 player games, I think that the key is to let other people fight for you and minimize your losses.

It's Friedrich with a political phase and Hussars. I think that they are about equal. I'd pick this one with 3 players and Friedrich with 4.

One play of the advanced rules, liked the game better than Friedrich.

Overall, I think it's a very elegant game, with simple rules and very few pieces on the board compared to most wargames. It's also a nice depiction of eighteenth century war, with lots of manoeuvre to cover supply lines, while the fortress protection rules allow active defence along interior lines.

The combat system is quite inovative, fast and tense, although it can be argued that it's not incredibly realistic. The balance between the three players seems to be good and allows for a more intense game than in Friedrich, avoiding the all against one problem of that game. The political system is an added twist that provides a nice break in the war making.

A great game that seems to play fairly fast (took us less than three hours with three newbies, though two of us had played Friedrich before - Austria's collapse led to the end of the game at the close of the second year).

Edit: second play, another collapse of Austria, with Prussia winning this time. Seems Austria in Maria may play the same delicate role as Prussia in Friedrich. Need to play as Austria to see how much of a problem this actually is.

Richer than Friedrich with slightly more nuanced manouver and combat and a completely revised political phase with player input. The Austrian Hussars are great fun for the Austrians and highly annoying for everyone else. Also, limited diplomacy now an option for some of the powers.

Absolutely gorgeous.

My only real complaint is that like so many multiplayer games, it really requires players to know what they're doing and understand the shifting play balance.

Final rating pending. Our first complete game didn't go very well, since Austrian player (my wife) got overwhelmed and discouraged early on, which left a free path to victory for Prussia (me). Probably should've switched France and Austria players and it'd go better, but I have a stubborn wife who's determined to stick with Austria and do better next time. :)

There's a lot of potential here though. The game system is very intriguing and despite this particular game leaving kind of a sour taste, I can't wait for another one. But it might take some time to get it to the table again, as it's a pretty lengthy game (around 4 hours) and needs exactly 3 people.

Friedrich 2.0. Az elődön sokat javítottak, mégis ugyanannyi pontszámot adok erre is, mert a két játék lényegi része ugyanaz, és nekem az tetszik mindkettőben legjobban: a kártyákkal kombinált seregméret, a kártyaszínekhez rendelt területek, és az ezekhez kapcsolódó csatamechanizmus. 
Ami lényeges különbség, hogy itt van egy kezdő változat, ami kb. Friedrich nehézségű, és van egy haladó változat, amiben megjelenik egy politikai tábla is. Ezen a táblán egy érdekes titkos licitmechanizmus segítségével bővülhetnek vagy szűkülhetnek a lehetőségeink. A nehézség az, hogy itt is a csatában használatos kártyákat kell beáldozni. Nagyon tetszik, mindenképp a haladót ajánlom, főleg azoknak, akik a két játék közti különbségre kíváncsiak!
Ami még más, hogy kikerültek azok a történelmi eseménykártyák, amelyek nagyon durva véletlenszerűséget vittek anno a Friedrichbe, ezáltal teljesen a szerencsén múlt pl., hogy mikor esik ki egy szereplő, vagy lesz vége magának a játéknak.
A huszárok is új elem, de nem annyira lényeges, mint a többi újítás.

Így, hogy megvan a Friedrich, nem valószínű, hogy megveszem a Máriát, de akinek egyik sincs meg, annak a Máriát ajánlom. Mindkettő nagyon szép, de a Máriában van egy nehezebb játékmód is, ha valaki ezt igényli. Játékhosszra nem éreztem különbséget.
---
Jópárat aludtam az első Mária-partimra, és az fogalmazódott meg bennem, hogy ez egy olyan játék, amivel nagyon szívesen játszanék nagyobb mennyiségben.
---
A második partink hihetetlen izgalmasan alakult. A poroszokkal olyan jól álltam (látszólag nyertem) a 11. körben, hogy az ellenfelem fel akarta adni, én beszéltem rá, hogy azért játsszuk végig az utolsó kört. És egy váratlan vereség miatt a poroszok visszaestek (1-ről 4 pontra), ezután majdnem megnyertem a franciákkal (1 pont), végül az osztrákok (tehát az ellenfelem) nyertek pontozással. Nagyon élvezetes játék! Tanulság is van: a dupla akkora össz-sereg nem garancia a győzelemre, ha a másik mindig el tud szökni...

[b]Introductory game[/b]
Intro Maria shares the same manuever and bluff gameplay of Friedrich.  The action only takes place on "half a map" so it's missing Friedrich's epic scale, but the new force marching rule allows players to be at each other's throats fast.  Intro Maria only takes 45-90 minutes to play.   

In this version Austria is the clear defender.  However, Austria can still play aggressive, such as conquering Bavaria's major fortress in Munchen.  The Austrian Player can also have some fun by placing Hussars and eliminating supply trains.  As for the Attacking players, Saxony and France are competing for the same upper Fortresses, so I've seen a lot of blocking, which is something you rarely see in Friedrich.  
 
Austria, 5 plays!
Prussia, 1 play!
France, 1 plays!


[b]Expert Game[/b]
Unlike Friedrich, each player is equally involved in the game.  France no longer has to wait around for something to do and the Russian Player isn't reduced to a minor power from the random Fate Deck.  The Political Cards in Maria can still bite you, but at least you feel more in control.  
     
My favorite aspect of Maria is that each player has opportunities for playing both aggressively and defensively.  At one time or another, I have seen an aggressive Austria taking over fortresses in Saxony, Bavaria, France and even Silesia.  I love that Austria does not always desire an alliance with Saxony.  Although it usually is a blast when Saxony defects and puts Prussia on the defensive!     

At first I was a little worried that most of the action took place on the Bohemian side of the map and that the Pragmatic Army was used simply as a way for Prussia to drain cards from France.  After 10+ sessions, I am happy to report that the Flanders side has become extremely interesting.                             

Prussia, 5 plays!
France, 7 plays!
Austria, 7 plays!

RATING: 9
This is a step up from Friedrich, specifically due to the players having more control over the political events. In Friedrich it is truly random, while here the winner of the last battle gets to have a say in the outcome. I think Friedrich is still the better game for nonwargamers to play, but Maria offers additional challenges for those with experience.

Maria is a tight, well balanced, three player wargame that implements an interesting mechanic where four standard decks of cards (2-10) drive the game.  The board is split into two theatres and players control multiple European powers.  An interesting twist is that the different European powers are already aligned so that the players aligned in one theatre are enemies in the other theatre.  While Maria has an accessible ruleset, the game has layers of complexity that will keep even a veteran grognard engaged.

This games uses the basic mechanics of Frederich, but it is better and shorter. Richard Sivel has learnt the lessons from Friedrich and designed a superior game, cleaning all the downside of his first title.
The game is shorter, the reinforcement phase better done, moving by interior lines is faster and above all the map and the system is designed to reduce the standoffs that a bad hans of cards have. Some victory points come also by the cards use on non military stuff.
The game is still military campaign, but cards can be used to attack enemy resources forcing him to have less cards and/or armies simulating commitment on other fronts. 
As is always the case in free for all three players wargames, how good is the game experience depends mostly by the players attitude. The system is very good by the way.
It is nice to see a game designer have original and solid ideas, and keep improving. There are so many copied games on the market and this is not one of the lot.

Very smooth playing asymmetrical wargame. Allthough some of the roles are more difficult to play than others, this game seems well balanced. The two maps combined into one and the schizofrenic role given to the Prussian/Pragmatic player, are just brilliant design choices. This is a tug of war with a nice political subgame to spice things up. There is some luck involved with the card draw but good spatial manoeuvering seems to be able to balance this out pretty well. There are a lot of rules and thus the learning curve is pretty steep. But the game plays so smooth once you get it. A must buy for players who like medium/heavy wargames that don't take forever to play.

 A beautiful and excellent design; encompassing asymmetry, strategy, tactics, bluffing, spatial elements and a political subgame. It is definitely a better experience with competent players as it keeps the balance of the powers in check.

I can't review all the rules to this game because I've only played it once. It was god awful enough for me to realize once was enough. It's War the card game with three players, drawn out over three hours.

A few things people will argue make it less like War... and why these things are crap;
     -It has an auction at the start of the round that is suppose to change course of play. For Austria, all those roads lead to bad. You have to pitch cards(which are your troops) to try to maintain status quo... which is probably not good if you are pitching cards to win these auctions.
     -There are three players. This leads to king making. Once one side is trounced they get to pour all their troops into fending off the trouncer. That means they never get to go on the attack, and the third player gets to just run unchecked in their pillaging.
     -You get to choose where you fight your battles. That's just a lie. You need to fight where your opponents are attacking, and if you don't have those cards you are just SOL. At one point in my game, almost every card in my hand were either behind the line the enemy had already crossed, or located in the far corner of my map... so I could totally kill them after they conquered my land.

It's just all bad, for three hours. Stay away. Ditch one of the players and play something fun like Fog of War or Quebec 1759.

RATING: 8
The basic movement and combat mechanics introduced in Friedrich are here refined and teamed with an ingenious political events subsystem that is also tied to card play. Reduce the game further by making the game a struggle between three players across two maps and what emerges is a   game that is even more of a Chess and Poker match than Friedrich! 

Our first game saw the Austrians in a strong leading position at mid-game. However, Austria was bled dry by continuous warfare and both the Prussians and French went on to dominate the second half. Austria was still in the running until Turn 11, when a gamble to recapture lost ground failed. Both of her opponents were poised for a sudden death win, but France beat them to the punch.

Looking forward to more plays!

Some more plays. I really love the game. Its the perfect game for 3 players.
The balance is very critical and if someone makes a mistake it could mean that his opponent will win the game. 
Unforgiving.

-----

I played the Advanced game, and the rating went up. 
I thought the advanced rules with the political changes would have more influence on the game, but in the end I think the game improves a bit.
----------------

First Play: we played the normal game without the advanced rules.

I could have given the game a higher rate... but what note would I give it after I play it with the advanced rules.

Better than Friedrich because the players are always "ingame". In Friedrich the power playing Prussia was always in action while the others played a lot less. In Maria you are always playing, this makes the game much better and gaming time is better since you are never waiting for someones move.

I'm really waiting to try the "political" rules.

It's got a ton of moving parts and it'll take multiple plays just to begin to get a good handle on strategy.  The mechanics were easier than I expected (I made a cheat sheet that I think got all the particulars right) but the implications of the decisions... oh, my god!  

It is very much a card-driven game, more so than many CDGs.  Cards are used for resolving battles.  They are also used for buying troops and for bidding on the political track which can get you extra cards, extra generals, extra countries (or the reverse!). It's less of a wargame than I expected and more of an area control/conflict simulation game (e.g., there is very little negative impact for letting parts of your home be invaded).  It's also very abstracted.  That said, it still had a strong ConSim feeling.  I also can't stress the hand management enough.  That is where a lot of the game is.

The other place the game is (and the place that it will take a few plays to get a feel for) is the negotiation.  With 3 players, you are always working with one and against the other, whether you intend to or not.  Figuring out what those implications are and using them to get some concessions is huge but also almost impossible to do in the first couple of plays.  

This is one I will need to play at least a half dozen times, just to get even a general feel for the game.  I'm concerned about making that happen frequently enough that I am able to improve.

La continuación de Friedich. Es un juego de simulación histórica que recrea la guerra de sucesión en Austra. Hay tres bandos: Francia, Austria y Prusia-ejercito pragmático. El tablero está dividido en dos zonas. El jugador de Prusia tiene un papel muy interesante, porque en una parte del tablero se enfrenta a Austria y en cambio en la otra, con los Pragmáticos, debe ayudar a Austria contra Francia.

Las batallas se resuelven por comparación de factores, utilizando ciertas cartas. También hay componente política, y tiene un papel importante los suministros.

No es un wargame en sentido estricto, pero se le parece. Además, funciona perfecto a tres jugadores.

This was tough to rate. The way the cards are used in battle doesn't

which nags throughout.

I think this is my singular best game of 2009!

Take a great game like Friedrich and make it better! It's not all against Prussia; but rather 3 against each other. And the Cards of Fate have been dampened to prevent wild swings to the game. They are intriguing small steps that can be mitigated along the way.

All the tension and gameplay is still there.

It's a bit more complex than Friedrich but well worth it. And it is still a lengthy game. (4-6 hours) 

It's rated a 9.5 and not a 10, because it rarely gets played because of its game length.

Rating based on one incomplete game. I really liked the card mechanism which is simple but balanced. Game seems to be really tough for Austria because of the dual nature of the role on the board but that is probably something that can be mediated with negotiation and agreements.

EDIT: Second game did bring different approach to the game which was interesting. But I still haven't played full game. 3,5 hours is not enough to play the full version of the game.

The story of a Europe wrought with political pride and distrust comes through in both the text and mechanics.  The learning curve is remarkably gentle for a game of this strategic depth.  There is a high level of co-dependency; the game hangs in a relatively narrow balance, so a weak player is likely to throw victory to one of the other two.

Maria is better than Friedrich I think - Friedrich just didn't work for me, while Maria does. But it's still frustratingly long. If it goes the distance, it could take 5 hours, or about the same amount of time as a game of Civiliation does for us (we play 5p classic "short" game to the last triangle). Despite the fascinating elements of the game, there just isn't enough going on here in terms of drama or gaming interest to justify that kind of playtime.
---
Friedrich was one of those incredibly frustrating games, clearly exceptionally clever but it just didn't work and was much too long. Maria is still long, but its 3-sided nature seems to work much better, and after just the one game I'm optimistic it may deliver on Friedrich's promise. Unfortunately, it's definitely less elegant, with more rules and more rules grit. But hey, if it works, it's not that bad and I can live with it.

RATING: 6
A good war-ish game for people that want to play a conflict game without too many wargamey rules.  It still has some of those unintuitive rules that make wargames a pain, but at least they're manageable here.

The highlight of the game is really the battle system, where you need cards in the suit of the region your troops are in order to fight.  It seems pretty tacked on (and odd that standard card suits would be used in a wargame), but whatever, it works really well and really influences your movements, as you'll want to hang out in regions that you have a strong hand for.

Overall, the game is pretty solid but just doesn't get me very excited.  With a couple exceptions, these sorts of move-troops-around-to-take-control-of-a-map type games aren't really up my alley, but I liked this one alright for a game of this type.

[b]Maria[/b] - My first play of [i]Maria[/i] was the big gaming event looming large all week. I think Maria is a strong game, and I greatly enjoyed some aspects of it.  As with most wargames, however, I struggled with the unconstrained spatial movement. Deciding where to go and how to get there is simply not an aspect of gaming that I care much for, especially as the available options increase. Additionally, our game largely turned on inter-player signaling and psychology, which unnerves me to the extent that it feels like it takes the "game" somewhat outside of the board (similar to the way that table talk and unconstrained trade unnerve me). 

I become unnerved when the game doesn't provide a context in which the signals are clear. Maria seems to require players to cooperate, even while they compete, for the game to be any good. But I couldn't figure out how to commicate my requests for cooperation within the game, and I certainly wasn't picking up on those requests from others. I'm not saying that needed tools are lacking in the game, but, at least with this group, the signals were getting crossed in all directions. Very few particulr game acts were clearly a message rather than noise (imagine playing Chess where you can move multiple pieces a few centemeters in any direction each turn).

Consequently, the players at our table increasingly looked to their own self interest, at which point the outcome felt increasingly driven by the weakest elements of the game. The feeling was quite similar to watching a poor player contiunously benefit his neighbor in Puerto Rico: although everyone played by the rules of the game, I think few would find it a fulfilling gaming experience.

In our game, the Austrians made (what I would consider) a boneheaded move to aggressively attack the Prussians out of the gates, depleting the resources of both. Seeing this, the French held back accumulating cards and armies with little resistance. The Prussians nearly wiped out the Austrians in the early battles, but the crucial point in the game came when the Prussians decided to aggressively invade Silesia after repelling Austria, expecting the Austrians to be busy licking their wounds and preparing for the imminent French invasion. Instead, the Austrians marched another wave of troops against Prussia in Silesia, essentially conceding lower Austria to the French. By catching Prussia unprepared, they managed to cut the Prussian supply lines and retake most of Silesia, winning just one turn before the French would have. 

On the one hand, I enjoy games that make me think about how my posture affects my opponents' decision-making. On the other hand, I dislike games in which so much of my own success depends on whether my opponents are making good or bad choices for themselves. There is nothing worse than losing because of an opponent's bad decision.

Because of the inability to communicate those messages clearly through changes in the game state, I suspect that Maria is a game that would only really shine for me when played by a trio that is both intimately familiar with the game and intimately familiar with each other.

RATING: 7
While I'm not sure that I love the way that the cards work (I'm withholding judgement until I get another play or two), Maria pulls off the brilliant trick of forcing each of the three players to worry about two fronts simultaneously, working with and against both opponents. That 'feels' right thematically and makes for a fun game situation. Supply is challenging and careful planning, as well as close attention to the suit-regions that you're leaving your generals in, is a must. 

All in all, I admire how unique the game is and that it is challenging strategically without an rules overload. iIt would be an excellent intro-to-wargames because it sneakily reworks a lot of classic wargame concepts (supply, ZOCs, rebuilding units, etc.), making the transition to the tougher stuff easier for the budding wargamer. The Euro-style components and lack of chrome also help keep it newbie friendly. More-than-two wargaming at its best. Must play again.

Game 2: I think I'm starting to understand the coolness of this game. Things to remember:
-The size of your army is critical to having the flexibility to retreat in good order.
-The game is essentially a land rush; worry about your own homeland only to prevent someone else from winning.

Game 1: I had really been looking forward to Maria. Bluffing and maneuver in a diceless three-player wargame with one player actually allied against himself. Highly thought of by people I trust. An improvement on an innovative combat system. This was going to be great, right? Well, it was fine. It was interesting. It lacked a certain passion. I'll try it again, but it is not the game I expected to be crazy about. It was my wargaming Indonesia.

War on Austrian Succession - like its precedessor, Friedrich, brings another hybrid between euro- and wargame. Much more fun than Friedrich because use of political cards. Very specific Prussian/Pragmatic Army player situation in a 3-player game. 
That 3-player game is a serious flaw, because France and Prussia/Pragmatic may agree to race for victory in Austria, which is very frustrating experience.

UPDATE 4/15: Upping this to a ten. When the rubber meets the road, there's just nothing I don't like about this game. The old joke about sculpting comes to mind: [i]sculpting is easy. Just start with a block of marble and chip away everything that doesn't look like an elephant[/i]. Sivel chipped away everything that doesn't look like a great three-player wargame where every single decision you make is significant on a staggering number of levels. As a bonus, it's remarkably straightforward to learn (as wargames go), it looks gorgeous on the table, and the designer is indefatigably supporting the game on the 'Geek.

If you're the type of person that doesn't mind playing a brain-burny game that lasts 3-4 hours, put aside your preconceived notions of what "wargaming" entails (whether or not you personally consider yourself a "wargamer") and give this a try. 

---

:tobacco: :( :what: :D A near-perfect blend of simple (and mostly intuitive) rule set and brain-burning strategic complexity. Extremely uncluttered board: countries have between 1 and 6 generals (armies) each, and conflicts are only as common as players want to make them. Every movement is fraught with multiple decision points: do I maneuver to a place where I am safe from attack? Do I maneuver to a place that will protect my fortresses? Do I maneuver to a sector of the board that uses a suit in which I am long in Tactical Cards? Do I force battle in a weaker suit because I know my opponent is weak in that suit as well? And what if accomplishing one of these goals throws off several others?

The downside of Maria, such as it is, is that it is not a game to dabble in once. There are simply too many possibilities for errors both strategic and tactical, and a new player who plays Austria in "search and destroy" mode, especially on two fronts, will make for a very short game as he is routed everywhere while France and Prussia race for their VP goal.

A group of players who attempt it multiple times, committing to thinking about lessons learned from the previous game, will find this satisfying.

I'm going to start this one at a hopeful 8.  I'm a fan of the game's older brother, but I think Maria is clearly the more interesting and mature work.  

That said, I wanna hedge my hopes somewhat.  This is a game that demands some real exploration before I'll be able to say more.  But it's an exploration I want to undertake, so that certainly says something.

Wow.  Fantastic game.  I love that the TC management is tighter than Friedrich.  The same great maneuvering gameplay is still there, so are the tense battles.  The production quality is great.
What makes this a step up is that all of the major powers will feel like Prussia does throughout a play of Friedrich--under a lot of stress from attacks on multiple fronts (although, Prussia and the Pragmatic Army have to go on the defensive less than Austria and France, which is fair.)

Uses the same (great) basic rules as "Friedrich", but with more sudden changes on the board, interesting politics system, strategically and tactically deep, true to its depicted era.
Despite all this strengths, could never really make the breakthrough in my game group (although we love Friedrich). Can only be played with three players. Has the problem that often two players close to winning gang up on the third.

Overall: 
Exquisite game, one of the best 3p wargame experiences you can get. A staple of any wargamers collection. 

+ Negotiations galore, with tough to value choices
+ Ever-shifting alliances and back-stabbing
+ Razor-edge power balance for all 3 powers
+ Delightful hand management and battle mechanics
+ Even when out of the win race, lots of fun decisions
+ Easy to setup, not fiddly

= Unforgiving, mistakes can be costly
= Complex both strategically and tactically
= Card knowledge a must

- Can result in bad blood between players
- Needs rational players (easy to king-make otherwise)
- Quite long, 5+ hours
- Easy to cheat (but we don't play with cheaters, right?)

This was particularly cool. And I've only played the base game. It looks like the full game is where the party's at, but even the base game was quite fun. Enough that I played twice. I hadn't played Friedrich (sp?), which apparently uses the same basic system. This is supposedly better. I love the setup: two against one, where the one is basically defending and trying to not get crushed. But the two have a problem in that while they're both allied against the third player, they're competing against each other for how to carve up the territory between themselves, as they don't win as a team. So as the defending player, you can buy some time by making it easier for one player (usually France it seemed) to grab some land that otherwise the other player (Prussia) would have taken. 

There is a fair dose of randomness in this game, as armies have a small number of troops on them (max 8), but in a battle most of the force comes from playing cards you've been dealt, in whatever suit your current location on the map dictates. If you get dealt higher cards than the other guy, you're strictly doing better. There's no tradeoff or balancing aspect. When I played with the Czech Games guys, they thought each player should get their own deck to draw from. Given the different colored decks, this makes perfect sense to me. But reading the rules, it doesn't look like it's supposed to be that way. But you could certainly just do it that way. Unfortunately, I never did get to play the full version. Some people who had played the full version said that it didn't add too much time, but the box says 2-5 hours, and the base game takes about 2 hours. So it's hard to imagine tha full version doesn't add a ton more. 

Could see rating go up with full game, if the extra stuff doesn't make the game collapse under its own weight.

With only one play I've barely scratched the surface on this, but what I've seen I really like. Id never really appreciated the subtlety of the card play.

A few key victories in the Netherlands and a timely elimination of a supply train left me able to protect my western flank. All in all, very keen to play again. Worth the wait.

This is a war game for board gamers.

It's a pity this game isn't imported more.

In my collection it's one of the heavier games, so I don't play it as much as I'd like to, but I really think it's an awesome game. The only drawback to me is the fact, that the Austrian player has to play really carefully in the beginning to stand a chance with the enemy which makes the game seem unbalanced. In addition, the turns drag for  quite a while, due to the amount of things that need to be taken into account with each move. Nevertheless, the game is very exciting and fulfilling.

I love euros and generally dislike wargames, but I think Maria is brilliant.  You only have to keep track of 2 types of pieces and you don't have too many of them.  Each side plays differently, and having one player be a Prussia-Pragmatic Army turncoat is fun.  I don't give it a 10 because combat is card-draw based and you can sometimes get screwed by the cards, but hey, that's part of the game and you need to work or bluff your way through it.

Also, for what it's worth, the board and components are nice to look at.

Give this game a chance even if, like me, you could care less about the War of the Austrian Succession.

One play only so far, but will come back to the table again soon. FANTASTIC 3p war game. Would give 10, but refuse on principle to do so after one game. I doubt this will turn out less than a 9. More comments after more plays.

Update: 3 games now, and Maria receives the ultimate accolade- a rating of 10.  I could see myself playing this every week for months and months. (with a restricted gaming schedule, this is a big deal). A game of this really satisfies. The three way see-sawing in the balance of power between the players is excellent. You can think yourself out of the game, but you aren't... you might be, but you never seem to know! 

Feints, bluffing, trying to predict and read your opponents... this is as good a wargame as I have ever played! (Note, I don't usually play wargames, but in my experience, I don't find them THIS good!)

The only downside, is that this game only allows 3 players, and once the enthusiasm spreads more than that will want to play! (yes this is a tongue in cheek complaint)

I like this game. Still there are two issues I have with Maria (after our first game)

1.) As France you cant really do much to stop Prussia from winning and vice versa. This has to do with the fact, that an opponent doesnt lose a victory marker if his own fortresses get captured.

2.) The combat system doesnt punish a player (VP-wise) normally, if he intentially retreats from the battle.

Brilliant design.  Started right off with the Advanced game.  Very intimidating ruleset, but clicks after the first turn.  Seems to be lots of replayability even playing the same power repeatedly, but switching powers would be an almost totally different approach to the game (Austria, France, Prussia & Pragmatic Army).  I was a bit skeptical about the card play (4 suits), but it works excellent in both combat as well as for politics.  The fact that it's a wargame best with 3 is another huge plus. There is supply in the game, but no command and control to worry about. Movement is simple and unrestrictive (you don't have to play cards for movement). Excellent components for a wargame as well. It's fun to maneuver armies around the board.

Marries the super fun (if occasionally frustrating) mechanics of Friedrich with honest-to-goodness victory conditions (as opposed to winning or losing based on the order of the event cards). Complex and challenging play delivered by relatively easy to handle rules. Welcome to the A List.

RATING: 8
Good game. Interesting mechanics. Not necessarily good or bad mechanics, just very different from what I'm used to.

Feels somewhat like a CDG, in that you have cards that you must manage in terms of politics, battle and replacements, but instead of "Ops" or "Events", you get a handful of poker cards, which you can use to bid on and purchase events, or use in battle depending on which "suit zone" you're in. Imagine [i]Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage[/i] where you know your battle cards in advance, but then so does the other guy, and they only work in certain areas. Oh, and those battle cards are also used for replacements and political events.

At the end of the day I felt like I was getting roughly historical game play. Offensives and supply are both difficult to sustain. There's political management, supply, movement, replacements, and decent variation in terms of combat results even with the rather wonky mechanics. Is it really any worse than a traditional CDG? Probably not.

Anyway, I can say I enjoyed it and that I'd play it again. The fact that it's a 3 player game is a bonus. I do worry about the Pragmatic Army having too hard a time, though I have seen them win once, so I'm not sure.

The division of forces between the three players is absolutely brilliant. 3p area control is by nature broken; Maria fixes it.

Maria is Richard Sivél’s 2009 sequel the highly acclaimed game Friedrich. In it each player takes the role of one (or more) powers in the War of the Austrian Succession: Austria, France and Bavaria, or Prussia, Saxony, and the Pragmatic Army. Two major items separate the game out from the other war games I have played: 1) The Prussian player is a bit schizophrenic in that they are playing both the Prussians and the Pragmatic Army who are on different sides of the conflict; 2) Battles are resolved using an interesting system that is based on playing cards. 

Unfortunately, over my 2 plays the game failed to captivate me to any great degree. In fact, it reminded me a bit of Napoleon’s Triumph in that while I appreciated the craftsmanship and obvious quality of the game, the game failed to engage me after it was over or excite me in any way, shape or form.

Interesting evolution of the Friedrich system, including two maps, an interesting political sub-game and specifically made for 3 players.
The core of the game still remains hand management, with trying not to spend too many cards too fast and knowing when to give up on battles. A lot harder than it would appear at first.

Would like to get and play again after hearing about how I may have been wrong about my perceived balance problems.  If I do and I find this game is balanced after all, it will be a 10 for me.  It would be that good.

RATING: 8.5
Preliminary rating, this might yet rise.

Here is a fast-playing multiplayer conflict game that I positively love. If possible, even better than teh groundbreaking Friedrich by the same designer, highly recommended! 

Improvements over Friedrich: forced marches, removal of the old random events, a great victory point system, non-military objectives, and more. Especially great is the a new event system in which you bid away cards to win control over events like diplomacy.

Great game, but I still prefer Freidrich to this system.  The added chrome in this one did not make the game better to me , just different and slightly more fiddly and complex.  I really like this game and system, in my opinion it is better executed in Friedrich.

RATING: 8
I must say that so far i have only played the once and that game was cut short significantly due to my bad play as Austria. I'm sure this can be put down to getting to grips with the way the game should be played and not a true reflection of how Maria usually pans out. 
    It is immediately evident, however, that the game is superb. A point agreed upon by the other 2 players there that day! The 3 player interaction on top of interesting game-mechanics and card play on top of a beautiful looking map all make this stand out clearly as a brilliantly designed war game. The rules aren't too complex either, making it accessible with regards to other serious war games it sits with. I want to play again and I expect i'll want to play even more after that too.

RATING: 6.5
This is a difficult game to rate after one play; I enjoyed myself quite a bit (playing as Prussia/Prag), but the poor Austria player got severely beat up.

While mechanically simple, there are so many moving parts that it's difficult to figure out exactly where you want to go and what that might accomplish.  Managing and protecting your supply train(s) seems to be the key, but I'm left wondering why you can't trace supply back to your home country when you don't need to do so when you're in it.

I think this is just one of those games that becomes something of a brain burner when you have deep familiarity with the game.  For three new players sitting down for the first time, the victory came rather by accident.  It's clear that it was the result of new players not entirely understanding the impact of their actions; it seems that the game is balanced to the point that if everyone knows what they're doing, you'll find the required tension for a game like this.  However, without that intimate knowledge, you're left with the trap that simple mistakes can easily cost you the game.

I'm almost certain that it deserves a better rating, but it requires a dedication to the game that few people are willing to put in without the initial hook.  Since it's my copy, I will make it a personal mission to get this played more, but I find it hard to recommend it unless you've tried it and/or you're willing to put the time in to really know every possible outcome and get to the meat of the strategy.

2016-11-23 : Invariably you can't comment on this game without comparing it to Friedrich, its older brother. It retains the maneuvering and bluffing and has 2 main areas where it outshines its sibling : Friedrich lives and dies on the competence of the Prussian player - if he's good, you'll have a good game, if he's new or makes mistakes you won't. Maria is more forgiving in that regard. The additional are where Maria wins is the various political tracks, which do matter. Overall this is the better game of the two.

Update: I love this game!
--------------------------------
Initial impressions is that this is a big improvement on Friedrich. The good stuff is kept, and most of the stuff that didn't quite worked is removed. The nifty cardplay mechanism is retained. The political game puts a bidding mechanism into the game, which is a huge improvement from the random "political events" end-game of Friedrich. Yes, this is the most important change of all. Hurray! 

Next improvement is making it into a three-player balancing game because the game is now challenging for everyone. Let's be honest here, Friedrich is challenging only for the Prussians. But now, this game is brutal for all players. Any mistake made will be severaly punished. 

My only criticism - It's still pushing 4-5 hours, which means it can barely sqeak in for an afternoon or evening game (and this is precisely the sort of light wargame that would be great for a short session).

RATING: 9
A superb game that offers wonderful tactical play in varied ways in that you play multiple countries and are allied with and opposed to the same player depending on which country you're controlling at the moment. On top of that, there's a whole political system which has been abstracted through bidding of your cards, the very same cards you battle with so you can imagine the decisions there. Moreover, whoever wins the last battle gets to choose the suit of the political bid. The decisions are truly delicious and as someone who really enjoys tactical wargames -- put me in front of a map with units to move and I'm in heaven -- this is as good as gaming gets for me.

I was (and am) a fan of Friedrich, but Maria is a far superior game.  I realize now that I was more enamored of the mechanics of Friedrich than in the particulars of how they were implemented in that game.  Here are some of the improvements.  

1)  Gone is the war of all-against-one, replaced by a war of all-against-all.  You're no longer watching the 'other' war just to see what cards people are burning.  When one of the other two players gets the upper hand, you have a variety of ways to try to level the field.  

2)  Gone is the 'swingyness' of luck in the Fate Cards, replaced with a more measured (i.e. SEMI-random), introduction of political events.  More importantly, you are not entirely at the mercy of those events, because of the opportunities to bid to control whether they occur.

3) Gone is the extended geography of the Friedrich map with its several fronts that rarely intersect.  Everything is now packed into a relatively tight area, and players can get in their ally's way or even outrace them to shared objectives.  And in just one or two turns, because players can quickly move from one hot-spot to another (or create a new hot-spot, for that matter), the game is much more dynamic and exciting.  

My only beef with the game is fairly personal (and this applies to both Friedrich and Maria).  The Tactical Cards are of course quite important to the game, and they are randomly dealt, so there can be times when you feel that the game simply could not be won (or lost, perhaps!) because of the cards you were dealt.  This is somewhat mitigated by the large quantity of cards, which helps to balance the luck, but it can nonetheless be hard to accept for those of us who are luck averse.  (Not a good trait in a wargamer, I know). This will prevent the game from ever reaching perfect '10' status for me, but it is nonetheless one of my favorite games.  Overall, a fantastic experience.

Update: struggling more and more with the randomness. A couple of recent games were almost unplayable due to the imbalance of the card distribution.

RATING: 7
Maria is a highly asymmetrical multiplayer war game. The initial roles are firmly allocated through historical context, and it seems pretty much impossible for any side to win on their own merits alone.

The game requires careful balancing by the players. If you push one player too hard you'll make it too easy for the uninvolved player. Much of what happens, therefore, is a delicate dance in order to further your own agenda without exerting your enemies or yourself too much, both on the battlefields and in the political arena.

All of this is done with a remarkably spartan set of rules.

Maria has a very reduced rule-set to keep the movement/attack/defense system clean. The extra pizazz came from Political cards, the very small amount of chits on the board to control (which make attack and defense an either/or focus at points), simple attack system (if somewhat abstract to the theme) and interesting scoring mechanics. Unlike some of my other favourite wargames (I'm only a casual wargamer) I think Maria doesn't reveal its true nature until multiple plays are had. In this first game (playing with the advanced rules) I felt the tension was missing. In Sekigahara (that uses cards for attack in a somewhat similar manner) there is nail-biting, sweat-drenching tension. This one felt ho-hum at times and even a little too luck-based with what was pulled. A player could move into better positions given the cards that were drawn and augment their strategy at almost every turn, but again, I think Maria requires a few plays to consider the total options and make strategies work. Same with diplomacy- we never tried to make any deals and I feel that is supposed to be a crucial part of the game. Overall, I like what it did with the desperate feeling of wanting to secure home and overrun fortresses, but needing to move the precious few units across the board in order to secure more territory. There was strength in that idea.

I've thoroughly enjoyed my first play.  Comparing it to Friedrich I find that there is a lot more going on which makes it a very different game.  Despite using the same mechanisms the feel is changed.  The switch from all against one to...well, not quite a free for all but more two separate brawls in a bar means there's a situation of shifting allegiances.  The political cards only increase this tension.

Eagerly looking forward to my next play and mulling over the experience.

Edit: Second play only confirms the high quality of the game.

RATING: 7
A very unique game wedding traditional card game mechanics with a light point-to-point wargame. A bizarre combination that somehow works really well. The only downside is the game can be over somewhat rapidly if not all three players know the dance. If player A is beating player B, sometimes player C must get involved to keep things on track. If player C doesn't recognize the situation and react accordingly, the whole thing can collapse. But, once everyone knows the moves to the dance I think the game can be pretty awesome. All this means is, this isn't a game you play just once or twice and think you've mastered it. No, this baby will need some real attention if it's going to shine.

Really interesting. The movement of the generals and the card-driven combat is roughly the same as Friedrich. The political system is neat, and much more strategically interesting than the Friedrich event cards. The three-player game has a nice balance to it; all three players have two fronts to worry about, and a comparable number of decisions to make on each turn.

The map is gorgeous, maintaining the high standard set with Friedrich.

Maria is probably a slightly better game than Friedrich, unless you really need 4p support.

A counter intuitive wargame in many ways. Attacking a weaker general with a much stronger one could have exactly the opposite effect than it should, allowing the weaker general to strategically retreat without it getting hammered at least once by a vastly superior force. Having overwhelming forces immediately on three contiguous sides provides no advantage to the attacker whatsoever (how does this make sense?) other than forcing a specific escape route for the overwhelmed defender.

The political card play is brilliant, however, forcing a balance of cards played in battle with those played in political manuevering. It alone doesn't save this game from being one that I will never ask to be brought to a game table because of some of the 'gamey' elements that stray from wargame strategies.

My first session was rough, and it seemed like victory for Austria was impossible. Further play revealed the nuances of the system and situation; things are tough on Austria but not impossible.

Panzer pushers beware, this game is the absolute opposite of WWII!

Well here's what it has going for it: It's 3 player, it's pretty, and it's about the War of Austrian Succession.

Beyond that, the game seems to just be generally stuck somewhere between wanting to be a history themed euro and a wargame. Quite similar to Simmons games, once you get past the initial gimmick (schizo player!), there's not much substance left.  The tossed salad mixture of game mechanics just feels disjointed and clunky (constant rule checks), making a game that is already long enough (for what it is), even longer. The battle card system, that ever-delightful legacy of Hannibal: RvC, just drags the game out unnecessarily and has no sense of connection to any finite resources. I do applaud the game for using hidden forces, but the political system is shallow and the negotiation rules give no sense of the historical conditions (beyond wanting to win the game). 

For my Austrian Succession fix I'll be looking into Lace Wars and hoping that Bob Kalinowski will do the Clash of Monarchs prequel he's hinted at. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Finally, the game Friedrich should have been in the first place. 
Manageable in 2 to 3 hrs is just right for this sort of game. 

The political and negotiation elements press, for me, a sweet spot. 

My impression till now is very positive.  

UPDATE
Very good game! I'm very pleased with it and I want to play again. I still don't know how Austria can manage to get out of this mess, but it is a game full of tension and pathos.

The game seems balanced on a knife-edge in the bad way--if things so slightly off for Austria (bad draws, minor misplay, overly aggressive opponents), the game spirals out of control and one other player will arbitrarily win. That is the good possibility--the other, more troublesome possibility is that the game is plain unbalanced against Austria.
Has some interesting stuff, but it can't quite overcome the nearly inherent difficulties in 3-player conflict games.

-Friedrich on steroids
-Obscure theme

Minus:
-I can't get over the card system somehow and this drastically hampers my rating. If it would provide points that you coud use to buy armies or so it would be perfect. I will try to use the CRT and army point system from Amateurs to Arms.
-For me a non-issue but it plays only 3. (2 also possible but with 3 players this truly shines) 
-Playing Austria is very difficult (maybe a tad too difficult?)

Core of Friedrich but with new individual objectives, diplomatic twists, force march, Huzars etc.

The core system is very easy, however the mutual dependency and the conflicting individual objectives of France & Prussia makes this game truly unique.

This and the diplomatic mechanism truly simulates the influence on the battle field.

Prussia's offers piece to austria, gains one VP and Silezia becomes home territory. Austria can accept in order to kick the French out of Bohemia. Prussia can organise itself for a renewed attack while Austria can tidy up things to receibve the coming Prussian onslaught.

At the same time France can reduce it's military objectives and focus on the Flanders map.....

Multiplayer only.

RATING: 6
You might rate Maria higher if you're content with it as a game, not a simulation.  There are oddities about the combat resolution that may help its play balance as a game, but I'm not sure what they simulate.  For instance, the winning side in combat never takes losses and can never advance.  The winner gets to determine the retreat path of the losing side.   Perhaps this is ok, but I've never seen it chosen by any other game designer.  One is retreated as many spaces/cities as the number of factors lost, so you can get sent tumbling 4,5, or 6 spaces across Europe and parked on a 'slow road'.  What does this represent?  I like the combined use of tactical cards for combat, purchase of reinforcements, sometimes supply, and of course bidding for political cards.  And I can see that they add to the fog of war and unpredictability of battles.  But, the people I played Maria with are ultimately unsatisfied with the cards' effect on battles.

RATING: 7.5
I was positively surprised by this one. It was probably the first real wargame I ever played, and the combination of great combat mechanics, politics, the many fronts made it immediately appealing. In addition, coming from more Ameritrash and Euro games, the purity and simplicity of the components have a very unique appeal to me. It's a very elegant game, compared to component fests like Runewars (which was played in the other room - and is a good game as well). The difference between the two games' boards was almost surreal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The best 3-player game there is. Extremely suspenseful and exciting game. There is TONS of game packed into this design and I love everything about it. Brilliant game.

When I first played it, Maria reminded me of JP Sartre's short story Huis Clos (No Exit), which is about his view of hell: three people trapped together in the same room for eternity. Three is a crowd; the odd one out always interrupts and disrupts. Maria conveys that feeling of mutual interruption but on a big historical scale. 

There is an amazing vertigo in the game when you think about what's going on strategically, but the mechanics are fairly simple and streamlined (the rules don't get in the way). I loved the busy feel of playing on multiple fronts and on multiple levels.

The story that emerges from the game is full of twists and reversals. The change-ups make for some whirlwind gameplay and some interesting metagaming, which the game encourages with some tight rules for making contracts and negotiating deals. 

For example, the game seems to want you to make truces with each of the other two players at different times. But to do that you set the truces up by creating certain pressures on the board. You play not only for conquest, but to motivate the other players to do certain things. How awesome is that?

I love everything about this game: the look, the combat (wow!), the movement and conquest rules, the political shifts, the player interaction, and the fact that the rules don't get in the way.

Maria is an absolutely splendid game. I knew that I would like it before I played it, but I did not or could not know just how much. This game blends a whole slew of elements that I generally appreciate to create a game that is at once (mostly) intuitive while also being deep. Between the hand management and traditional-esque card-play, the explicit negotiations made between powers and the subtle communication of where one's strength lies, the military logistics, the bluff and counter-bluffing all come together to create a highly memorable Machiavellian experience for three (in roughly 3-4 hours). I can't think of a better game for three players within this time frame as it is lovingly designed such that all three sides must push against one another, keeping the others in check within ever-shifting relations, the whole length of the game. 

Furthermore, the elements which support the game only make it all the richer: the map and the cards are an absolute delight to gaze at; the introduction within the rules provides enough history to set the stage (but beg a personal exploration at another point in time); the designer's notes provide insights into how Maria was birthed from Friederich and what was required to bring the "third side" to this uneven balance of power.

This game is simply brilliant.  Such a delicate balance is required by all 3 players.  You really need 3 skilled players for this one but if you have the right table I couldn't think of a better game for 3 players.  Tension is present almost the entire game.  Love it!

It's good. Also finally a game you can play with three players.
Besides the abstract but very tense & enjoyable combat the game coneys a lot of theme through it's minutia.
One of the downsides is that defending your own provinces is utterly unimportant to claim victory. Your country could be half gone, but if you've successfully invaded you win.
And i missed a logical explanation for the card management, something like it's your ressources you have to allocate. But it's actually just that, you fight bad in one city and great in the next one.. hm..

But besides that very enjoyable, could've been awesome though.

Despite the length of this game it is quickly rising to the top of my favorite games of all time. Any game that can keep me engaged and interested for over 3 hours deserves a high ranking. This game is tense, full of strategy and planning and every move you make matters. There is also some amazing poltics and negotiations. By far the best 3 player game around. No other game out there can simulate the type of three player environment this game creates. One minute you will be crafting a nice little contract with player B against Player C and the next you will be making another contract with Player C against B a few turns later. The deal making and politics raise this from a solid wargame to a truly great masterpiece of a game.

I really like how detailed the board is. A lot of point-to-point movement systems don't give you nearly as much fidelity. Pretty simple rules that give rise to a lot of complexity in-game, which is the way things should be. Some concerns that the "diplomacy" part of it requires a certain mindset that many may struggle with. Just because Prussia was your enemy last turn doesn't mean they can't be your friend this turn...and then your enemy again next turn. A lot of people seem to think the object of the game is to crush Austria or to hold grudges for the entire game.

RATING: 6
A 3 player sequel to Friedrich and like its predecessor it critically depends on some non-intuitive groupthink in order to work. If France and Prussia pile in as history would suggest, then Austria's only tactic is to threaten suicide to obtain concessions and that's hardly realistic. It also unrealistically awards no VPs for defending one's own territory, making the game a straight race of conquest in which you simply need to cross the line first. Standard suited battle cards hardly enhance the theme (OK, it's not massively different from the battle card system in We the People/Hannibal, but at least they have theme pasted on). It's also overlong, the quoted 3.5 hours is an average that pre-supposes some sudden death endings, allow 5 if the game goes the distance. That's far too much for such a simple system. I just can't get excited about this series, at 2.5 hours this would be perfect, the designer just couldn't resist adding lots of chrome that extends the game to the point of tedium.

Beautiful point to point map with excellent manoeuvring possibilities. Game is deceptively complicated and deep for the very short rulebook. The diplomatic element is absolutely key - you can rule on the battlefield but lose the game in the delicate three-way balance. Last game as Prussia I destroyed 4 whole Austrian armies through encirclements (in the process paying about 50 points of cards to Hussars) but Austria still got the win, as France was collapsing in the South.

PbeM suitability: better than expected, but still not good. Battles can just be resolved via email (without going into the Vassal module) and then block discarding cards used at the end. But I think I'll avoid it by email in future.

It's rare to find a wargame that is richly thematic without being a) too scripted, b) bogged down in minutia, or c) both, but Maria pulls off the feat rather admirably.  The incorporation of playing cards into the game works impressively well, bringing hand management to the game while avoiding the whiplash effect you sometimes get in CDGs.  I also like the way events are handled, giving each player a chance to make an event as valuable as they want it to be.  My first play was as the Prussians/Pragmatics, which I was skeptical about at first but ended up quite enjoying as I was able to use each to advance the other's agenda.  Overall a very nice design, and one which I'm eager to try again.

Maria improves on its predecessor Friedrich by being shorter, a little faster paced and more balanced in terms of the opportunities for and involvement of each player. The political cards are a nice touch, far better than the event cards in Friedrich.

Slighty worse than 'Friedrich'.  Worse because there's too much chrome and mechanisms that complicate that game, but don't really add much to it and are, in fact, unneccessary.  'Friedrich' is more streamlined, which is better in this case.
Secondly - the role of Austria is absolutely crucial for the proper balance of the game.  The most experienced player should control it.  But with my expected frequency of playing 'Maria' (or strategy games in general) I would have problems with finding 'Maria-experienced' players.  I definitely prefer when the game balance itself, not thanks to the master play of expert players...

What I DO like in comparison to Friedrich: hussars (simple and effective chrome), victory by emptying your markers pool and length of the game (known from the very beginning/set duration: 12 turns).

I've got 'Friedrich' already and 'Maria' offers almost exactly the same gaming experience.  Barring that and the fact I consider 'Friedrich' a bit better (see above), I don't feel a need to possess them both.

Sold.

RATING: 9
One word sums up my thoughts on Maria, Phenomenal. Of course if I left it at that it doesn't help anyone a whole lot as to why...

I was always interested in Frederich, but the cards of fate terrified me for the most part for a game of that length. Then along came Maria, and I knew from everything I read this was going to be awesome, and man o man it did not disappoint. The quality of the design really reminds me of Napoleon's Triumph where you immediately know once playing its something special, but boy these rules are much more intuitive than NT's(and huge bonus just as short and elegant). What really makes Maria unique is the asymmetrical nature and especially the relationships of the 3 players. Austria and France are always opposed to each other, but 1 player (we dubbed the slutty skitzo) is playing both sides, literally, and as such the game allows negotiation and deals with this player so there are most of the intriguing elements here that normally come from such deals; trust issues, backstabbing, etc but all talks are open info/above board so to speak. All this creates an interesting tug of war of sorts, especially for the Prussians/Dutch player (Skitzo) as on one front they are attacking France for example, yet on another they are allied with them, and then they have this same relationship with Austria! 

Another great feature is here how Combat is resolved, basically it has a Taj Mahal auction like combat mechanism which of course I think is awesome (love Taj) and creates great tension, excitement and has a great push your luck element to it as well so just great fun. The really nice thing here too is like Taj, you can retreat/quit at any time which gives you some control over the battle and any loses you might have to take (won't always work, but at times you can retreat with a small loss). Forces have a Fog of War effect, the size of a force is unknown until involved in a conflict. Conflict rules are dead simple, compare force size, player that is behind has to cry uncle or play cards until that number plus forces are greater than opponent, then other player responds and this continues until someone eventually loses/quits. Getting into a big pissing match can really make you vulnerable as you might imagine so hand management is critical (know when to fold em). Winner forces the loser to retreat number of spaces equal to the loss, and damage is dealt also equal to size of loss. Loved all this. 

You also have a couple other very interesting things here, especially concerning Politics. At the start of a round 2 Political Events are potentially going to take place, players secretly bid on whether or not they want to control these using their same hand of cards (also for combat so you need to be careful). There is some more tug of war introduced here with countries like Italy swaying one way or another, and sometimes you may need to bid on a card to make sure the event does not happen to not suffer the ramifications of such an event (ie if Italy is too aligned with Austria France loses a card, and cards are power). A few of the other things you know and love about wargames are also here like supply, forced marches, winter, stacking, main and back roads, etc but note NOT the usual rules overhead thankfully. I really like the supply rules, and as it often does it made moving and spreading out tricky at times, if not careful your opponent could wipe out your supply chain and have you suffering loses for some time. Of course spreading out is exactly what you need to do to win.

There are exactly 2 things and 2 things only holding Maria back from a 10 for me (likely to go there anyway, its just that good); luck of the draw and the length. It seems to be very long for a 3 player, like the full game could easily run 8 hours for many games until familiar, though an ending condition could make it much shorter, but I'm thinking on average after some time it's going to be 5-6 hours full game. I'm not sure how much shorter the shorter game is, but it would sure be missing a lot without the Politics, I would rather leave all the good stuff in and play 3 rounds instead of 4. For the luck, the nice thing here is it does not come from dice like most war games, and due to how combat works you have some choice on how/when to get screwed when luck is not in your favour (vs just getting screwed). Having said that, drawing low cards for a while could really takes it's toll, I'm not sure how probable this is yet and just how much impact it will have. I may have one other very slight niggle here, in that the wargamer in me wonders if the cards are overly weighted compared to the units on the board. What I mean here is the size of the force is really backseat and for my tastes maybe not quite weighted enough compared to cards in hard and card play; if a force is outnumbered 8 to 4, it really won't matter if the underdog has more cards (even one more) and the unit ratio becomes almost totally nullified. Anyway its just something small I am currently deliberating, more play might silence this niggle. 

Overall Maria is a really outstanding, well put together and special package, and one I found deeply engaging as there were quite a few things to keep an eye on and you really had to be careful when planning your moves. I also found it to be very unique and intriguing and I look forward to exploring her and the period more.  

[u]UPDATE[/u] Got in a second game. Just love the asymmetry here, playing a different power changes things up nicely. I don't think the luck is too bad here, and way more tolerable and manageable than dice no doubt in my mind, its a little like Tigris when your missing a colour (here a suit) it forces you to adapt and get a little creative. I am surprised that Richard didn't suggest each player having their own draw deck as a variant, this would really lower any luck and just randomness would be left. At any rate, the card distribution seems good in my two games thus far and luck did not seem to be a significant factor. 

As for the length, damn. The thing is each player takes it's whole turn before another will go, and this is what slows it down and causes it to feel longer while you're waiting (and movement is half of everything here you have to be careful and can't rush it). You can plan while someone else is going but what they do is likely going to change what you do. Add to this Combat, Winter and then the Politics (nevermind a little potential negotiating) each round and it's easily 30 minutes for a full turn, x 12 rounds = 6 hours for the whole shebang (could end sooner on a condition but not often I'm thinking and not that much sooner if it does usually). My idea if not going Full Monty is to play with all the goodies but only for 9 rounds and not 12, there are potential balance implications here though that have not been playtested since this is not suggested in the rules. With more play while still being familiar with the rules and strategy, 4 to 5 hours should be doable I would hope.  

Maria is a real beauty, and in a way a bit of a hybrid, to me its mostly a Wargame (more than TS...) but the combat and Politics have a good bit of Euro influence, and if Euro gamers can fathom the length they will find a lot to like here.

Potentially long but highly involving war/political game using hybrid Euro/wargame mechanics from the designer's earlier Friedrich. In particular, the emphases on manoeuver, hand management and knowing when to fight and when to hold back shows through as a strength once more.

The political rules add complexity and length compared to Friedrich, but replace the randomness inherent in Friedrich's fate cards (which was actually fine by me) with a more predictable (within limits) political framework.

Designed for three players, but (unlike Friedrich) each player will always have at least one major power in play so avoids the downtime issue that could be an issue with Friedrich when France or Russia get knocked out early in the game.

RATING: 8
This is a three player wargame with slick asymmetry, smooth and engaging combat, an interesting political subgame with a tug-of-war feel, a little bluffing, and spatial maneuvering that is satisfying and open-ended without being brain-busting and chess-like. Oh, it's good. Maria is the painstaking 5-year development of a game already hailed as one of the best multi-player wargames ever, and the polish and confidence of the design are immediately apparent. This is not a difficult game to learn, and for once, you don't have to be familiar with several (stale?) wargame conventions to get into it.

At the start of the game, Austria is near victory but being attacked on two fronts by the French (with Bavaria as a minor ally) and the Prussians (with Saxony as a minor ally). The player controlling the Prussians also controls the Dutch ("The Pragmatic Army"), who are at war with the French. The Austrians also have troops allied with the Dutch. Austria quickly finds itself on the ropes, but at some point the French have to back off in the West so that the Prussians don't steal an early victory. Presumably, at that point Austria can re-group and fight back in the North while the French carve up the Netherlands. We didn't quite make it around this mid-game pivot, but our session was fascinating nonetheless.

It's possible that this is the best wargame I've ever played. Anyone interested in the time period and in the design (3-players, asymmetrical, 4-5 hours, great pacing) should check it out.

An interesting effort.  The fact that victory points are not zero sum allows a player to win the game even as the house burns down around him - I'm not sure how I feel about that.  I dislike the ability of players to pick and choose the consequences of the political events they select - I'd rather they had to take or leave the full event, although I did like the bidding.

The TC cards are an odd mechanic - it works, but it's not the easiest thing to accept.

RATING: 8
Worthy successor of Friedrich. The split role of the Prussian / Pragmatic army player is most remarkable and plays remarkably well. Compared to Friedrich, the luck swing of the fate cards was replaced by a clever bidding mechanism for political cards. It seems a bit more balanced although Austria still has a harder time to win than other nations. This is true at least with inexperienced players as Austria's best shot is going for the full length and winning by points. From first play my impression is that France has the best chances for a premature victory if players don't balance their forces and go the easy route of bashing Austria jointly. I'm not so sure what to think about the more advanced possibilities in the political phase such as subsidies, negotiations or neutrality of Prussia. These options call for experienced players. Always difficult in long multiplayer games. Friedrich is more accessible. For the time being Maria therefore scores a notch below Friedrich.

In my one and only play, I rolled my opponents with France/Bavaria, which tells me we must have been doing something seriously wrong. 

Anyway, it's much like Friedrich, in that it rewards careful attention to the contours of the board more than strategic play. If that's your bag, this is going to be an awesome game. If you'd rather play with a combat resolution mechanic less abstracted than playing cards, then look away, baby, look away.

I'm not sure exactly what the nodes on the board represent - do the paths between them imply actual routes that armies tended to take? Did the major routes actually exist? Are all the knotty little culs-de-sac reflective of any real-life tactical situation? I don't think so.

There is a lot of tension in the game and many different strategies and options for every country.  

What surprised me the most was that the game had a huge downtime but it did not seam to bother the players since it was interesting to see on your opponents turn what he was planing and aiming for. The game can take about 4+ hours to play but during that time you will definitely have a lot of fun.

Maria can be a cruel mistress. I appreciate the mechanic that encourages you to adapt your play on the board to the suits that you're dealt, but I prefer to make my decisions based on the board not my hand. You cannot send your armies to where you think is best and then hope to draw the cards to support it, you have to make sure you engage in the suits that are are best for you.

I find it a little strange that this 'gamey' aspect turns me off a little bit (I'd still happily play the game its just not a favorite) because I tolerate equally gamey aspects in other wargames.

Also, a little too much downtime for my taste.

Interesting game although a bit fiddle-ly at first. I was playing Prussia and the Pragmatic Army (it is a bit schizophrenic as Prussia as you are both an ally and enemy of Austria depending on the hat you wear although it basically two different map sections). We got through 3/4 of the game and ran out of time although Prussia was still in the lead. Beautiful board and card art. This is Friedrich++ with diplomacy, forced marches, and politics w/ bidding on influence.

The first game in the series Frederich calls for some interesting historical events, e.g. the sudden collapse of Russia following the death of Queen Elizabeth.  Not sure if I was into the history with that.  The movement system is interesting with the card draw though. 

Maria, like its predecessor Frederich, is very much a neat and playable strategic level game on the War of the Austrian Succession. The Austrians, under the young Maria Theresa (23 years of age), were trying to defend the country from two sides - the French on the right and the Prussians to the left. Ryan taught us the game, including the Advanced Game rules on politics, in half an hour and then we started off the game easily.

As many of you who know the system well, a very unique feature in the game is the use of Tactical Cards. They are used in combat as the players play them alternately, while following the suit on the grid of the map, in an attempt to defeat the enemy with higher score, having added the strength of the troop. The troop strength was recorded in a roster sheet and kept away from the opponents - conveying a certain sense of fog of war after the troops taking several battles. The difference in the score was the number of troops to the side who lost the battle and the number of cities they had to retreat.

The game board is gorgeous. It portrays the whole theatre of operations very well and comprehensive. When I played the game as the French in the first game, the sharp red cities and fortresses pulled me going and going from one to the next - Dijon, Nancy then Metz, etc. I won the game nicely when all the French pool of victory markers was emptied, meaning that they were already placed on the conquered cities and fortresses in Osterreich Niederlande to the north and Deutscher Nation to the east. In the second game, I was the Prussian going south to conquer Sachsen in the east and the Pragmatic Army flanking the French on the left from Lille, St. Quentin and Maubeuge. The map is certainly one of the strongest feature of this game.

Apart from the combat, the Tactical Cards are used to resolve the political swings in the game. The player who won the most recent combat determine which suit is going to play for influence over the political cards, which are revealed in pair at a time. The political cards can swing the position of Italy, Sachsen and Russia on the political display. The effects range from more troops brought into the map, expedition corps (i.e. removing troops), outright victory points etc. It is fun to see how politics come into picture as special chrome while not overburdening the players. Similarly, there are some rules on Imperial Election, whereas the Elector College gets to vote on who is going to be the Emperor - Austrian or French, decided by the majority of the votes. An extra VP on the box.

Another interesting concept is Subsidy Interest, virtually referring to one Tactical Card be given by a major power to an allied power. The players can negotiate with others and all agreements are binding, say on a subsidy contract, a vote in the Elector College, a coordinated strategy on the board, or even armistice.

I like the game overall. It portrays the War of Austrian Succession authentically, while elegantly being "chromed". It plays like Euro somewhat, with the trump suit stuff and card management - sometimes you have a handful of cards in your hand. You might feel your decisions are heavily influenced by what cards you have. Should I move to that spade area for a fight next turn when I don't have the spade cards? Or should I bluff that I have all the high heart cards while I actually don't? I confess I did it once in my game. But the enemy retreated. Sometime I feel that the playful Tactical Card system draws my spirit away from the "hard" decisions I am going to make.  On the other hand, Maria is definitely a game for the strategic thinker.

I liked Friedrich a lot so when Maria came available I jumped right on board. There is lot that is the same and a lot that iis changed...on the whole I really like the challenges presented.

In any 3 player game, balance is of utmost importance and that is certainly true here. It is all the more subtle as Prussia plays both sides - itself and Austria's ally the Pragmatic Army. So France must weigh what it does so that the Prussian player walks off with the game. Austria must do likewise but finds itself much besieged as Prussia was in Friedrich.

I love the tension introduced by the balance issues.

Best 3-player game ever. The schizophrenic role of Prussia (playing against the Austrian player in Bohemia and beeing his ally in Flanders) as well as the originally victory conditions make this game unique and outstanding. Manageable rules allow a fast access to the game.

RATING: 10
I've had a chance to play this twice so far and I'm impressed.

UPDATE: I've increased this to 8.5 for now as this is a fantastic game. Once I've had a few more games I'll reassess my overall score and see what I come up with.

UPDATE (Nov.2010): Hot damn! What a game. This scoots up to 9.5 for now and only because it takes quite a few plays to see how Austria can overcome its deficiencies; lessons learned. Now she's holding her own against the other powers and man, is this just an amazing, well thought out, sublime piece of gaming. I'm sure that I'm going to have no choice but to eventually give this a 10 but that issue with the required number of plays to get even competent at this still leaves a little wiggle room. It's damn hard to fault a 'wargame' that even my wife will willingly play.

I've gotten so many plays of this recently that I've sprayed all the playing pieces with acrylic, placed all the 'powers cards' in hard acrylic cases, sleeved all the tactical cards in their own colors and built reveal boxes for all 20 generals while also purchasing 1cm cubes for the troops (painted black). Well worth it as now Maria can be played FOREVER!

UPDATE: Jan.2011. Had to go the extra distance and upgrade this to a 10. I cannot see anything wrong with how this game plays. It's absolutely brilliant, quite possibly the most intense 3-player pseudo-wargame I own. Fantastic!

UPDATE: Mar.2012. This game is in my top-10 to stay. It's not often that you witness genius. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you MARIA!

UPDATE: Oct.2012. Still going strong. Even my mother-in-law has been bitten by the Maria bug. Treat this as a card game with plenty of bluffing and you'll get nearly anyone interested in at least giving this a go one time... and then two times, etc.

UPDATE: July.2013. This game has lasting power in my household. Just pulled this out the other night and with a quick refresh of the rules, it all comes flooding back again. What a great, great game! It's got everything I could ever want. As soon as she begins to show signs of wear (even just a hint), I'm buying another copy.

UPDATE: September, 2015. Best 3-player game that I own. Unique, engaging, and it's gotten to the point where no matter what cards I have in my hand I am able to devise a strategy to best suit those 'suits' and values. There is so much parry and dodge in this game and it's fantastic.

A worthy successor to Friedrich.  I'll need to play more before I decide if it's better, but it certainly adds some interesting twists.  The combat cards have less variation, only going to 10.  There are new ways to score a few vp's, including the political charts and winning battles.  The Deck of Fate is removed in favor of the political cards/charts, making swings much less sudden and give the feel of greater control.

MARIA有INTRODUCTORY GAME及EXPERT GAME兩部分，前者只有90分鐘多，只重佈兵打仗，似Friedrich。後者兼玩國際政治，可玩3至5小時，要思考的範圍多了，層次深了，與Friedrich是兩回事。

I played another game of this recently, and really enjoyed it, even coming close to winning (yes, I would have won if France & Bavaria weren't first to move in a turn - drat!)  This can be a 3-5 hr slog, but we managed it in about 4.5 hrs, with a 45min break for 'lunch', which I thought was pretty good going. Be warned, it is a time-sink, albeit not usually as long or as 'straight' as Friedrich... I'd plump for this over 'the big F' anytime, but it is limited to 3 players, which isn't ideal for every gaming group...

7/12/10: tentative rating of 9 after 2 games. Maria is a fantastic successor to Friedrich. It has all the tension in a remarkable made-for-three-player wargame. The politics cards add a little side-game, where one can cause problems for one's enemies by affecting theaters and events outside the scope of the map. For example, if the "Italy" track goes very far over to either the Austria or the France side, France or Austria, respectively, can lose a general (sent to Italy), lose a TC from their draw, and the other side can even place a victory marker.

The combat system is essentially the same as that in Friedrich, though with tougher supply rules and the wonderful ability to force march on main roads, to allow more rapid movement on interior lines.

Wonderful game. I can't wait to play again.

Rating based on 3 players.

Loved the combat system and cardplay, and the board is wide open for plenty of manoeuvring tactical play. The "schizophrenic" player adds an interesting quirk to the game. There are quite a few situational rules that increase the historical flavour/accuracy, perhaps more than I would ideally like as it increases the complexity and rules overhead... however the game is overall easy to understand as the bulk of gameplay only requires simple & straightforward rules, and once you get going it flows well. Play Friedrich if you want it simple, and Maria if you want to go a little deeper, but both are lots of fun!

Maria, I just met a girl named Maria!

06/12/10 Played once through turn 7, in 4.5 hours, within a hair of a victory. Very balanced. Some nice improvments (graphics and mechanics) over Friedrich. Other positives: Its designed for three players, which is rare. Also, the theme, The War of Austrain succession, is nice as its a period not often found in games. I look forward to playing Maria again.  
08/21/10 Played again. 05/28/11 Ditto. 09/15/12 Ditto. 04/13/13 Fifth game, finally won!  Play time highly variable due to which turn the game ends, how fast players take their moves, and how many battles you have. My games have lasted 4 to 8 turns and 2.3 to 5.1 hours.

For a non-wargamer this could be a very disheartening encounter so I usually go with '[i]See, it's just like Condottiere with a bigger map and more maneuvering[/i]' approach, and after a relatively short time you're knee deep in politics and negotiations.

GREAT game! Although it's a 3-player game, it might even be better than it's predecessor Friedrich (which is a 4-player game).

RATING: 7
A fun game with lots of promise. It's a game that got it all, sort of - you fight with cards allowing for a large dose of bluffs and games of chicken, you need to carefully consider you movement and supply-chains (on a somewhat hard to decipher point-to-point map), and you need to play your two opponents with great nuance, balancing where to push and where to pull away, and when of course. Add a sprinkle of extra stuff, make every faction asymmetric and you have the ingredients to a good and fun game.

This is no doubt the kind of game that grows on you, especially with a consistent group!

Clever (yet simple) mechanics and rules. A lot of things to consider here since all powers affect each other, especially in the near of the end game where every victory point is essential. Some bluffing possible too.

Have only played the 2 player once.  Considered it to be terribly unbalanced.  Maybe the three player is better.  I still don't know why folks are so enamored of "dice-less" games.  The use of Hearts-spades-clubs-diamonds as a randomizer is no better a randomizer than dice and actually worse in my opinion.

Uses the Friedrich game system but rather than everybody against one player (Prussia), it's a three player game where each player has alliances of some sort with the other two players making it a careful balancing act. 

The genius behind this implementation is that instead of having somewhat random events that drastically effect the game this one has events that are bid on when they come up.  There's also some mechanics in place where alliances with the smaller countries can change over time.

Another beautiful production with a lot of historical flavor.  I prefer this over Friedrich for the shorter player length and the fact that everybody has a somewhat balanced path for victory (I say somewhat because Austria looks like a tough position to play).  In Friedrich I felt like Prussia would always be the most fun and challenging to play.

1 play with the beginner rules and 2 plays advanced. The advanced rules make it a complete game and I would say that the beginner rules are not required for a first time play, but if you do use them, don't judge the game based on them.This an excellent light war game that really take sa play or 2 to understand the tactics. You can't win every battle so don't try to, otherwise you will likely lose the game. It's really about manouver and not combat.

I'm still not sure how I ultimately feel about war games, but I will say that I love this game. I realize it's more of a hybrid game, but I find it to be a more engaging play experience than a lot of more "traditional" war games that I've tried. The rules complexity is low, the combat is very streamlined but extremely tense and dramatic. There are some group dependent things that can affect how the game plays out (mostly negotiation based) but that's not a bad thing. It's also a really attractive game which doesn't hurt matters.

Play cards to engage in politics and move your generals to conquer fortresses in Flanders and Bohemia most quickly.

Plays: 7
Type: Wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map to destroy other military forces and/or conquer territory. Blocks and area movement style. Strategic scale.
Complexity: Medium wargame.
# of players: 3.
Playing time: 120-300 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict, Diplomacy and Misdirection.
Randomness: Medium – card draw.

Replayability: High. This has depth and you want to try to do things a bit differently next time. Assymetrical positions also increase replayability.
Fun: Good. Subtle bluffing in battles is fun. Balancing your diplomacy is fun. Outmaneuvering your opponent is fun. Killing his supply train is even more fun.
Memorability: Good. This creates a story about warfare in the 1740s. 

Thematic integration: Good. The named generals, the place names and the political game all add to the historical feeling. The mechanisms are pretty abstract, sometimes creating a thematic disconnect.
Components: Very good. This is a good looking game. It has very few playing pieces, a definite "less is more" approach. It's elegant.

Who will like this: Gamers that want a minimalist wargame for three players. It's very tricky to design a balanced wargame for three players that avoids a regular 2 v. 1 scenario. This does that very innovatively.

RATING: 9
Very, very good strategic/political wargame. The rules are actually quite simple but the game play is very deep and involving. Set in the War of the Austrian Succession players play Austria/Pragmatic Army, France and Prussia. The object of the game is to 'spend' all your victory markers from your victory pool by taking enemy fortresses, winning battles etc. Cards from 4 decks of modified playing cards(clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades) form the currency of the game. Its very elegant and, to say that it involves an element of abstraction, feels like a remarkably good simulation. The downside is its length. For our first game we played for 4 hours and only got just over half way through (in our 2nd session we got through 2.5 games in a 3.5 hour session!). Not a great game for those suffering analysis paralysis.

2-3 players

Reprint in autumn 2017. Which is better: Friedrich or Maria? 

[i]MARIA is a game based on the War of the Austrian Succession, where Austria was attacked by Prussia, France, Bavaria and Saxony, while only Great Britain, Hanover and the Netherlands (by forming the so-called Pragmatic Army) helped her.

MARIA is primarily a 3 player game. One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria's enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria's ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.

MARIA is derived from the award-winning Friedrich, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony's betrayal and Prussia's annexation of Silesia. Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory. However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin.

MARIA takes you to the era of the 18th century's ruthless struggle for power. It can be played in 2 variants: the shorter, simplified introductory game or the longer but richer advanced game, with its simultaneous campaigns in Bohemia and Flanders.[/i]

I think this game in unbalanced with Maria having to little chances of winning. I suggest a bidding mechanism, where you bid additional tactical cards (income) for Maria (or less tactical cards for your favorite power).

RATING: 10
I usually don't play war games, not any more, and usually I avoid playing games that are too long. There are exceptions and at the top of all of them there is Maria.

Maria is an absolute masterpiece. There is so much depth and so many interesting strategical choices that the game appears like a canvas in which the players can express their personal way of playing. And the interactions and the shifting negotiations between players are very tense and beautiful. 

In the game I have found some of the mechanics of Friedrich that I liked already so much in Friedrich. But it improves with respect to Friedrich in so many ways. So if you like Friedrich, please do yourself a favor, and try Maria. If you don't like Friedrich, do yourself a favor, and play Maria. If you have never played Friedrich, try Maria. If you like deep games (and if you are not afraid to play a game that in the worst case can last till around 5 hours), it is unlikely that you will be disappointed. It requires a bit more effort and time than the usual Euro game, but it is all worth it (and you don't need to be a war gamer to appreciate it).

Very very recommended.

Roger Leroux (leroy43) says that playing Maria or Friedrich is like playing chess and poker at the same time. 

It's more chaotic than Friedrich, there's more to carefully watch when it's not your turn, and it's more fluid.

Maria is a light strategic level wargame about manoeuvring and bluffing. Even though this game takes few hours to play, it is surprisingly fast paced. However, Maria is quite a brainburner and some turns can be long. You have to think your moves carefully or you are deep in trouble. The rules are light but the gameplay is anything but. I like the fact that this is a three-player game. There aren’t too many three-player games that are this good. In Maria objectives are asymmetrical but the game is well balanced. The situation on the board is constantly changing. Furthermore, each player is constantly involved in the war. Essentially this is a eurogame-like wargame with diplomatic twists. Don’t get me wrong. This is a wargame and even though it might not be a detailed simulation, it has enough historical flavour.

RATING: 8.5
Bellissimo gioco di battaglia con molta cura nel tentativo di ricreare l'ambientazione corretta. Apparentemente il gioco sembra non immediato, in realtà una volta partito procede lineare senza troppi problemi. Strategicamente bisogna sempre tenere d'occhio entrambi gli avversari perché, giocando a fari alternate, è possibile conquistare gli ultimi punti vittoria in maniera relativamente veloce. Per vincere bisogna adottare una strategia molto offensiva, ma scoprire troppo il fianco all'avversario risulterà poi irrimediabilmente rischioso. I 3 giocatori impersonificheranno gli austriaci (Maria Teresa), con una partenza decisamente in salita, i francesi (Luigi XV) alleati con la baviera che secondo me hanno un buon vantaggio e i prussiani (Frederick) alleti con la Sassonia ma anche con l'onere/onore di seguire le armate pramatiche, compito nevrotico dovendo spalleggiare a volte gli austriaci e a volte i francesi. Un gioco da provare, dalla durata variabile grazie alle possibili (secondo me frequenti) vittorie anticipate.

RATING: 7
I am conflicted on this game. I love the mechanisms, though the politics session isn't as "up my alley" as the wargame portion. The wargame portion is really, really neat, with card play that interacts with the map in very interesting ways. The two-part map and schizophrenic 3-player setup are bizarre but seem to work just fine. Very tightly designed, even if Austria does get beat up at the beginning.

But it's 5 hours long, which means it won't see much play, especially when compared with other 5-hour feature games. I do love it, but can't rate it too highly since I don't know how often I will get to play.

Superb not-too-heavy 3 player historical wargame. Designer Richard Sivél wrote somewhere on BGG how important tension is for him, and how much he's willing to sacrifice to make sure there's tension and roads to victory every turn in the game. Well, he succeeded with Maria. There's always someone about to win, and you're never really out ofthe game. And every victory point counts! I fear some games might end prematurely, when the first player who's about to win, well, wins (at say, turn 4 out of a maximum of 12 turns), but with some more experience that shouldn't happen too often. More likely is that every player will be at one point within just a few battles of taking the game. 

The game flows well, the ruleset is quite elegant, while maintaining a strong historical feel; there are always many options, different paths to victory. You have the freedom to go where you want, try different approaches. Battles can be swingy, but victory points are also easily lost; there's always time to right a mistake (or bad luck) and stop someone before it's too late. Diplomacy and politics play an important part, which was quite a suprise to me; I didn't really expect it in a game with only 3 players. It works well.

Recommended!

I’d been wanting to try Maria for a long time, as the combination of spatial play on a board with managing a hand of cards often appeals to me. And my recent obsession with Wir sind das Volk made me even more keen to sample another Richard Sivel design. My first play at LoBsterCon was... overwhelming. I was France, and got into lots of fights with Austria which ended up draining our cards and letting the third player walk into our undefended territory for the win on turn 5. It was one of those games where every time you do something, you learn why you shouldn't have done it that way. I barely engaged with the political subgame at all; it was enough trying to grapple with the huge map. I did really like the way the board interacts with the cardplay though, and I'd definitely play again. I just don't know if that'll be soon enough that I can learn my lessons.

This game is incredible.  Our first session, with players new at Friedrich, was a blast as we figured out all the rules.  Our next two games we shifted places, and each time we thought we knew what the game was about, it rocked us again!  The delicate dance between the three powers, and the brilliant Pragmatic/Prussia mechanic makes the game fresh each time.  Being a brilliant player at winning battles no longer means you will win, for every action that is made has an equal or opposite reaction somewhere else! Bravo!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game, similar to Fredrick but with its own flavour. The fate card phase has been improved and is not as devastating. Has the same tension as the original. We found that Prussia was hard to beat and had the advantage of a large hand of cards and not a lot of pressure from the other powers. Austria has two fronts so has lots of tension, as does France.

Brilliantly designed, each power has a different feel while playing. All seem balanced. Only drawbacks to the game are the length of play. It definately feels different to win at this game than a euro victory point cruncher.

UPDATE: The only caveat is that it takes us so long to play (9 rounds took 5.5 hours in our third game) If it continues to be this long I will have to drop the rating. The time commitment is substantial, the rules are intricate and hard to teach to newbs so the learning curve is substiantial as well. IF we spend too much time between games we will forget much of the rules as well.

Maria is quickly becoming one of my favorite games.  I like the battle system where "suits" represent battlefield terrains in a way and you have to fight in a field you're prepared for.

The politics system also makes this game shine more.  A great game.

I am really torn trying to rate this one.  Maybe I am just trying to get better at rating and more discerning.  I VERY much enjoyed the first play of this.  The secret army strengths is nice.  The card play is nice.  It has a good flavor.  However, it does remind me of placing cubes in a Euro game.  Also, I am not sure I "feel" like I am playing a wargame.  Does this really deserve to be ranked 11 of ALL wargames?

Hey, played again.  I am not sure it deserves to be called a wargame, but it is good.  Rating improved!!!!!

RATING: 6.5
I don't know what to think of this game. The combat mechanism is compelling but gamey. To win a battle, you have to play cards of the suit that matches the suit on the board where your general is. The two factions against Austria could try to conspire and have Austria fight against one suit of cards, thereby draining him of strength in that suit.

Another unique thing is that losing a battle by retreating is often a good thing. When you lose a battle you (simplistically stated) lose a number of troops that's the difference between the sum of cards that your opponent has played and your sum. So you could try to play cards so that the difference is only one, then try again on your next turn.

Consequently, I think the point of the game is to slowly whittle away your opponents. The interaction is subtle, but perhaps too subtle?

RATING: 7.8
(+) Intriguing set-up with complex political situations. This is a delicate war-game certainly not a brainless bash your enemies type of game.

(+) Asymetric set-up with the 3-player game in which one player controls Prusia and the Netherlands, on one map allies with Austria and on the other one opposing Austria makes for some interesting situations.

(+) Spacial element in which you have to cleverly place your troops and their supply trains in order to perform well.

(+) The game makes you feel like a real European power, deciding the fate of the continent. It gives you a lot of feedom in the way you try to accomplish your goals.

(-) This is a 3-player game, which in our group is a siginificant disadvantage

(-) Battles are mainly resolved by using classic playing cards (4 different symbols ranging from 2 - 10 and some jokers). This is significantly better than resolving battles with dice, as cards can be stocked and they allow a player to plan an attack or optimal defence on the map ([i]'I'm strong in hearts, so I can force something on this area of the map'[/i]). However, still there is great randomness in the way cards get distributed. If you're out of luck and you mainly draw low numbered cards, you won't stand a single chance of survival: you will not be able to make the difference: not in a military way, not in a political way. It can be frustrating not to draw the right cards necessary in order to attack a certain area of the map and there is little to nothing you can do to mitigate this type of randomness. Attacking is also a bit of a gamble - even if you win, if your opponent has the right cards in order to minimize the defeat, this could be problematic for the winner and again, there is no way of knowing...

(-) Playing this game takes a *huge* time investment: explaining the game and playing it is pretty time consuming.

Play time: Easily 6 hours and more.

PS: The asymetric set-up sure is intriguing, but I'm not entirely sure if it is really balanced - especially when players or not really familiar with the game... I would have to assess this by playing more often...

A little bit more complexity and chrome than its 4-player predecessor Friedrich, but just as playable and interesting, with the same fascinating characteristic look and feel. The rules are odd & subtle (e.g. one must pay careful attention to distinctions of major and minor powers, allied and cooperating and enemy and neutral, etc.), yet pretty carefully/precisely written and not too complex.

The card-based combat system is odd but fun with beautiful stylish components.

I suppose if you like one, you'll like the other! I like both. Maria seems easier for me to get to the table just because it needs only 3 players instead of 4.

====

But 2 complaints about sub-standard markers:

The 132 square markers are very lamely die-cut: They have white side nubs sticking out where they were attached to the sprues, which are very hard to try trimming off, and make the markers look cheap and ugly. :( Most modern game companies know to have the markers attached at their corners, not in the middles of their sides.

Also why do most fortress markers have fortress on front and question mark on back, but some of them annoyingly have question mark on front and fortress on back? Pointless confusing inconsistency.

A beautiful game designed with such care deserves better markers than these, which are not congruent with the rest of the game's otherwise excellent physical design.

Great wargame with some negotiation - variety of ways you can get victory points and you don't need to eliminate your opponents' troops to win, just push them back or sneak behind them. The historical aspect is really interesting - I like the politics. The battle mechanics, playing cards by suit, is just really novel and plays out like a great tug of war.  The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because of the length of the game, it doesn't hit the table very much.

Upgraded to 10. I just really want to play it all the time if I could.

A fascinatingly deep, medium weight war game. Great production values accompany some solid mechanics. I like the suit-based card battles.

I definitely look forward to giving this one another try, in addition to Friedrich.

I don't know why, but this grabbed me more immediately that did Friedrich. It had the great stuff from Friedrich: the emphasis on manoeuvre, a combat system that made battles on one side of the map relevant to those on the other, the beautiful components. 

However, to this it added a clever politics system far superior to the ticking clock in Friedrich due to the level of player control. In addition, as a three-player wargame, it fills an important niche. 

It is particularly well balanced. In my first game, each player came within one victory marker of victory, creating a lot of enjoyable tension. Indeed, it is so well balanced that each player must be very aware of how their actions will affect the other players and other parts of the board. Therefore, you have to be very careful not to hand victory to another player. As a result, in a way, its extreme balance gives the game the impression of being imbalanced.

Decent game; history grain of salt.

In some sense superior to Friedrich in that there is more politics involved and different ways to gain victory points. On the other hand, I like how Friedrich had surprise endings (just like real life!) and its starker, this is war, mentality.

Played with two and won as France/Bavaria, as the latter had an excellent initial deal and Prussia brought much weight to bear thanks to aggressive, thoughtful attack and an extra card from Russia for most of the game.  

Played with three and mucked things up with Austria, bowing to a Bavarian-fueled powerhouse from the West. Played again and exacted revenge as Prussia. Played again and was threatening as France when Prussia pulled off the win.

I still don't like the extreme abstractions--of generals, army sizes, combat--but the game does have a certain flair. The different ways of earning VPs makes for some fun. Austria seems like it will be hammered unless it makes a deal--quickly--with one of the invading powers. I'm not sure how they can actually win, though.

Lower raters' comments about card-hoarding and players eying each other waiting to swoop in for a quick win are other possible serious faults with this game. The latter, at least, seems to have some basis in reality. Maybe a three-player game (where only one player can win) of this war, or almost any war, is off-base? It's still fun to play, but...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably the best multi-player wargame I've played, and indeed it's best with three players see-sawing with alliances and teetering on the brink of victory, only to have it snatched out from under them... or not.

The battle system is somewhat abstract, but very clever and different from typical dice combat. Need to choose when to lose, especially useful are the Reserve Cards which allow you to choose the value 1-8, so you can lose by one and grind the attacker down with a string of slow wins for them. Throw in the little matter of choosing the best ground to battle on and it's super clever and works fantastically well.

Politics are more interesting than I first thought. There's the chance to build up for something really advantageous, or deny your opponent something they need. The simplicity of the system and how it bites into your reserves is quite clever.

Alliances - well, this is finally a war game where ganging up on the leader works.

Very rewarding and thematic game. Doesn't suffer the same issue I had with Frederick. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
I just played a game called Maria...

Though I enjoy the game quite a bit, there are two things which make it a bit wobbly for me (one shared with Friedrich).

First, the victory conditions are not zero-sum, by which I mean that defense gains you nothing and only denies points to your opponent. Generally you cannot win without offense. The effect of this is that so long as France (for instance) can hit Austria hard enough to score a win, it doesn't matter how many fortresses they lose to the Pragmatic Army. I am not against a non-zero-sum situation on principle, it works effectively in keeping erstwhile allies (i.e. France and Prussia) from being able to directly interfere with each other, but the general attitude it seems to provoke is one of racing hellbent to the VP finish line without too much care for historical consequences. I consider the jury still out on this one.

Second, and this is the bit Friedrich also gave me trouble with, is that the main combat resource (the tactical cards, "TCs") has no ceiling in usage. Certain situations (which always seem to come up for my opponents) allow a player to accumulate staggering amounts of TCs, many multiples of the seasonal "income". This sort of stockpiling is not only of questionable simulation value, but it makes battles foregone conclusions when the cards should instead be adding tension and variability. I wonder if a maximum hand size might be in order -- it would have to be carefully managed so as not to hamstring the minor powers further than they already are.

Still, Maria is a good time and the operational bits with the maneuver and fortress protection coverage are very very good and give excellent feel for the siege-oriented period, with a minimum of mechanical interference. The map and other components are wondrous. I plan to come back to it again.

Very good game. Extremely interesting scenario with the schizophrenic Prussian/Pragmatics player hindering and helping Austria. The battle resolution via cards make it important to choose where you will fight, and the additional political dimension enriches the game also. Austria probably the most challenging role in the game.

This game is to me as good as 3 player games can get. I especially like how this game is a game of positioning, politics and fighting losing wars while trying to eek out that last victory point. I thoroughly enjoyed the common short term alliances, the obstructive "teammates" and the hands of low cards that never win a battle, but win the game regardless.

There are two shining stars in this game. First and foremost the cards, and specifically how they are used in combat. The board is divided into squares and each square has a suit (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs) what square your army is in determines what suit you use as trump. This is perhaps the best way I have seen the simulation of generals picking the terrain where they will fight. The other shining star is the 3 player system where one player is on both sides. Yes sounds confusing but it just works. Basically (and it's been a while so I'm going from memory) they are terrain locked where their armies in one part can only reach one opponent where their armies in another part can only reach the other opponent. The downside is the advanced rules politics are a bit muddled and bog the game down.

Wow, what a great game! Takes the basic mechanisms of Friedrich and adds an interesting political element as well. The card distribution is also changed, with a smaller range (2-10) and Reserves being worth only 1-8 ... that should lessen the luck of the card draw a bit. In Friedrich, it's most fun when you play as Prussia; here, it seems that every power has an interesting time of it!

Really look forward to playing this again. Rating could definitely go up!

RATING: N/A
Introductory game. Played once with three players.
I think that this game has nothing but positive things. It seemed very well balanced and busy to all players. Everybody was involved in the game and everybody could have won the game which ended in the 9th turn with a French victory. 
It's a quick wargame. I guess it could be easily played in about 90 to 120 minutes which is quiet an achievement to a dense wargame, especially if we're talking about a three player wargame. 
Rules are very simple to understand, even more if players already know Friedrich because the heart of the game is almost the same with a few (even though strong) changes. 
The map is absolutely gorgeous! We could actually be talking about the most terrific map I've ever seen. Superb design and graphics. Also, the devision of the map with the Flanders zone is very cool and it manages very well the tactic aspects of the game by introducing some very important minor restrictions that cause a good technical feeling about what players/nations should do to balance strengths.

I'm really interested in playing the full complex game because it should add a much more historical flavor. It should turn the game into a much more rich and diverse experience in many other aspects such as diplomatic matters and strategy.

Played the full version. There are lots of things to think about and to learn about this game. The political version adds something really interesting in my opinion because players should know where to bet and search for new victory points. Nothing should be putted apart since every point can be a major point. 
I've played for the French in a major epic game of more than 5 hours and it was a hell of a game.
Luck can turn things easier or not (of course). I didn't have much of luck and but I still think I could have won the game if I had played differently.
The cards players have in hand represent money and power so they have to be very well managed.

Can't wait to try and play the game with Austria and Prussia/Pragmatic Army. 

I really think this is a genius design. What a game!

Played it again this time with the Prussians. Totally different feeling from the game with France. The Pragmatic Army also has a major role in the scene and I guess there's a lot to learn here.

This is my favorite game.  Period.  This is the one.  "Wargame" notwithstanding, just as a exemplar of what a history game can be, I can't praise Richard Sivel enough for bringing this complex conflict fully to life.  

Mechanically speaking, 'Maria' is elegant hybrid of asymmetric Chess and Poker, full of bluff, manoeuver, and political counterpoint, all played out against a vibrant historical backdrop.  It's an understatement to say that it's a strategically deep game, and yet just as much of an understatement to say that tactical execution really MATTERS in 'Maria'.  

When I finish this game, I always feel like I've just completed reading an exhilarating piece of historical fiction.  If I'm lucky, I'll be playing this game for many years to come.

I'm not normally a big fan of war games. 

The first few plays, Maria seemed like an okay war game. The movement and combat systems are simple enough. There is plenty to think about to keep players engaged. The politics cards are interesting, although at first they seem like they were just thrown in by the game designers. But overall, as I played the game more and more, I began to like it more and more. 

The reason I grew to like Maria is the subtle role communication plays in the game. Generally speaking, each player has strengths and weaknesses that are initially secret. Each action a player takes reveals a little bit of information about their strengths and weaknesses.

Once players become conscious of this dynamic, the real game begins. Should you go on the offensive, or feign weakness to draw your opponent into a devastating trap? Is it worth the risk to discard from your weak suit to get an awesome politics card? Should you stack your armies to obscure their individual strength? 

The game is phenomenal due to its potential for manipulation and intrigue. It is designed for three players, and it is very good as a three-player game. The two-player varient is longer and more intense--highly recommended for two experienced players.

While I enjoyed Friedrich, I really hate the scenario that this game puts you in.  According to all of the strategy guides, the only way for Austria to compete is for the Austrian player to threaten suicide in order to exact full concessions and full withdrawals by the other two players.  Any game that rewards dramatic and passive-aggressive play is unacceptable to me.  Another problem is that there is too much dependency upon player to player diplomacy and not enough actual action.  Despite my low rating, I can see why some people might like this, but I cannot see why this is called a war game.  This is a euro with a couple of war game elements.

Point-to-point wargame performed with so few pieces it becomes a dance, and a coy jab & retreat sequence can be very effective setting up big moves. The cardplay brings creative board decisions & bluff. The simple & constrained negotiating phase is a wonderful balancing mechanism in what is essentially a three-legged race.

The game I most want to get extensive play. A top game even with one play. It screams quality of thought, design, innovation, passion, components.

Although I am not a big fan of wargames, I really liked playing Maria (advanced game with three players)! After reading the rules, I felt that the game was pleasantly streamlined and straightforward. After my first play, I still feel it has a clean design, but nothing in the manual prepares you for the subtleties of the game! Even when you move a single army there are so many things to consider - the suits you hold in your hand, your supply train, your opponents' protecting armies, the balance of power in the area, the cards you will need for voting, etc! After the game, we all felt the need to extensively discuss what had happened, and immediately made an appointment for our next game. Next time we intend to play differently...
UPDATE: France won again. We do not have a clue how to win with Austria. Still a great game, but there is quite a bit of downtime involved.

A more involved version of [gameid=12891]?  I'll take it.  The great maneuver and battle resolution is still here from Friedrich, but there's even more good stuff now, including a better political system, and a slightly more interesting VP system.  I somewhat miss the purity of Friedrich, but the changes to the political system alone make this a better game.  The one drawback is that it isn't quite as accessible as Friedrich, which means that it's not necessarily going to rope in fresh-faced wargamers quite as easily.

Maria is an unconventional wargame.  Its presentation is unconventional because of the quirky & intricate map, the incredible art throughout, and that it's centered on a woman leader.  Its game play is unconventional because it is a three player wargame and primarily because of its original method of combat resolution.  The combat resolution involves troop strength coupled with card play.  The cards are suited and numbered (sans face cards) like a conventional card deck.  The melding of card game tactics with battle tactics is novel and adds a layer of strategy that is simple on the surface, but offers depth with experience.  The game basics are very straightforward and involve very few pieces (by wargame standards), but there also are a number of chromey bits (Imperial election, outside political influence, banking/spending political capital) to keep tabs of.  The aspects I appreciate the most are the map board (which creatively fuses two into one) with a big web of linked cities, and the schizophrenic role of the Prussia/Pragmatic Army player who commands the two factions who hold allegiances to Austria that are at odds.  By far the prettiest game in my collection and also a very original game design.  I foresee the rating going up with experience.

Only one play thus far, but I like the way it plays. I really like the tension felt by all nations. The end was reached in our first play in 1743, where three of the major powers all had met their goals by the end of the same stage (Austria/Pragmatic Stage). The Pragmatic League winning it narrowly over Austria by exceeding their VP goals with an additional French fortress captured and a 3-point battle victory. Although we made a lot of mistakes, the game still seemed to balance out. The board situation - along with the Political cards - will take time and repeated play to master. I definitely look forward to it.

I'm blown away, what a game. Could not believe it would be as good or even better as Friedrich. Friedrich is one of my holy grails. But after 1 play I know already, a perfect 10! If you have Friedrich, buy this game, period. If you don't have Friedrich, buy both! You can play Friedrich with 3-4 players and Maria with 2-3.

But if you have to choose? We played Maria and all 3 of us had played Friedrich and we agreed..it was a huge advantage for playing Maria in the 'profi-variante'. So maybe it's wise and play the Introduction game if you never played Friedrich.

Our first game lasted 5-6 hours. It ended without a winner, so the winter scoring was decisive. The Pragmatic Army had 22,  Austria had 19, Prussia and France both had 18!! Prussia won (if it's a tie, Austria always wins and France always loses). Nerve-wrecking and we loved it!

Recommended!

I like this one a bit more than Friedrich as it pits everyone against each other.  There's less randomness with regard to the events and more political bantering between players.

This one does not promote cooperative game play!

It's impressive when an already award-winning design can be reworked to the point where it makes the original (Friedrich) look almost pedestrian.

As part of Maria's design structure, all of the major powers have their particular strengths and special considerations.  Austria is fighting a seemingly 19-front war, but has Hussars to squeeze cards from invaders' hands.  At the start, Prussia has a strong military presence and a Saxon ally, but is tempted to sue for temporary peace to activate an off-map supply train. France is positioned to shift armies between fronts, but must choose wisely in splitting its focus between Austria and the Pragmatic Army.

The start-of-turn politicking is a slick evolution of the Friedrich system, as cards now have multiple uses and political outcomes can have dramatic board effects.  Also, it's refreshing that - even though military objectives are still the #1 concern - other historical objectives (e.g., winning the Imperial Election) and combat successes both contribute to ultimate victory.

Lastly (but not leastly?), Maria is a shorter game than Friedrich.  That's a good thing.

All in all, this may end up being the best three-player game that I own.

Maria is one problematic game. I really wanted to like it but I can't. It's massively unbalanced; don't listen to the fanboys who claim otherwise. There are many counterintuitive features: it's all about conquest and there's very little motivation to defend your home country; the card suit system creates abstract situations when an army is strong in one map grid but laughably weak in the next; alliances are forced and diplomacy is meaningless; the combat system makes losing purposefully an important goal; an army's strength has little meaning compared to the strength of the cards you happen to pull. Threatening suicide and throwing the game is actually a valid strategy, which is simply unacceptable to me. Damn shame. The subject matter and theme are very interesting, the rules are light and easy to remember, and the components are beautiful in their own minimalistic way. But playing this game simply is not enjoyable.

Vibrante, violento, rápido como una estocada. Las batallas se viven como los duelos de aquella época: Si vacilas te derrotarán, si te lanzas alocadamente estarás perdido. 

El tablero y las cartas conforman un cuadro de pura elegancia, emotivo y dramático, de líneas limpias y pulcros uniformes militares que se siente que pronto aparecerán manchados de sangre.

Un juego muy denso a nivel táctico y estratégico. Lleves el bando que lleves no olvides la famosa máxima de Bruce Lee cuando el enemigo te parezca inabarcable y el precio a pagar por las posibles batallas inasumible: Be water, my friend. 

Actualización:

Nada tiene que ver con mi anterior gran descubrimiento, Path of Glory.  Allí la acción es lenta pero con la fuerza de una ola, desgastando los frentes a riesgo de debilitar los tuyos, y de que tu rival lo aproveche con consecuencias devastadoras para ti. En Maria la acción tiene un carácter totalmente distinto. Toma a Austria y contempla impasible cómo Prusia entra con glotonería en tus tierras, mancillando tus ciudades a medida que sus generales las toman. Y su lacayo, Sajonia, lo sigue como un perrito faldero hacia Praga, insensato, piensas, si fueras tú sólo te aplastaría en un santiamén pero... Francia y Baviera también vienen a por lo mismo...

Y eso que todavía no hemos echado un vistazo al otro mapa... aunque allí tienes al ejército pragmático para enseñarle a Francia que también podría perder, y mucho. En ese escenario paralelo se parece más al juego del gato y el ratón. El ejército inglés no recibe tantas cartas cada turno como Francia pero su presencia es suficiente como para que los franceses atraviesen las fronteras austríacas sin la certeza ni la determinación con la que lo puede hacer Prusia, y los húsares se encargan de poner de relieve sus desventajas, sangrándolos en Bohemia a cada paso que dan.

Ahh... qué puedo decir. La mecánica es al mismo tiempo exquisita y feroz. Violenta y rápida como una estocada. La percepción de la fuerza que se tiene del rival cambia con cada carta que se juega. Tienes tus cartas. Sabes dónde eres fuerte y dónde no. Tengo picas y diamantes y sé que puedo parar en esta región lo que me venga. Miráis a vuestro rival y pensáis: Os creéis invencible, pero no sabéis que entre estos dos generales sumo dieciseis tropas y que cuento con estas dos cartas de refuerzo que serán vuestra ruina ¡Venid! Alejaos de vuestras lindes, dejad que vuestra avaricia os separe de vuestros trenes de suministro ¿Me atacáis? - Te pones la mano en la boca para disimular tu sonrisa - Prusia toma con problemas un aparatoso montón de cartas, tranquilo al pensar que serán más que suficientes como para zanjar ese pequeño obstáculo. 

Iluso. Empieza sacando cartas con cifras astronómicas pensando en resolver este breve e inconsistente trámite rápidamente. Las deja caer sobre la mesa como si cada una de ellas fuera la última palabra que oyesen mis generales antes de retroceder. 

Pero no es así. Pobres insensatos. A cada carta prusiana, Austria contesta con el suficiente envite como para bloquear y devolver el golpe. Prusia empieza a ponerse nervioso ¿Qué anda mal? ¿Es posible que Maria aún tenga diamantes en la mano? Los ojos del jugador austríaco permanecen inalterables. Prusia calla y teme. Entonces fuerza el empate. El jugador de Maria sonrie con claridad.

El siguiente turno será Maria quién tome la iniciativa. Los dos habrán acabado muy desgastados en los respectivos palos de cartas que hayan usado, y el oponente habrá tomado buena nota mental de ello. Para qué si no estarían los franceses, sajones y bavarienses contemplando la batalla, cuales buitres esperando ver tambalearse a su presa. Maria debe moverse a otro palo donde vuelva a ser fuerte y replantear el siguiente paso que será más duro y arriesgado que el anterior, teniendo en mente que con el tiempo será de obligada necesidad que sea ella la que invada a sus agresores, para inclinar la balanza hacia sí misma.

Maria es toda una joya. He vencido en muchas batallas pero he perdido todas las guerras. Y no puedo dejar de pensar en la próxima partida.

Maria adds a new level of strategy to the Friedrich system through the political tracks and cards. However, much as I enjoy Maria, I still prefer the simple elegance of Friedrich.

I suck at this game (too) so badly, but I still find it fascinating. Sometimes it just feels too dependant on luck of draw, but I guess that's just me. Definitely requires several plays to get the feel of the dynamics.

The natural evolution of Friedrich and even better in nearly every aspect. I also love the fact, that it`s one of the very few games that is (best) played with three players. Fantastic!

A tower building game where you are either trying to mess with other people's towers or building your own.  Points are based on the minion's number and your foreminion multiples the total floor amount by what floor he is on.  It's a decent game with some take that mechanics to it in that you can screw with other people's buildings, but the randomness makes it so that you are a the mercy of the draw and when big fights come up.

Fun little filler or light, short time game. It's cute, has some fun humor with the bit of take-that interplay.

RATING: 8.5
Great art, funny characters, and a good time.  You need to have constant prep since you don't know when a fight might break out - totally rearranging your finely tuned plans, when the game's going to end, or when someone is going to put their monster in your pyramid to cause mayhem.  Lots of fun, and the huge brawl (for better or worse) at end game has you always guessing about who's in the lead.

Jogo de cartas divertidíssimo! Mecânica que não vi em nenhum outro com efeitos imediatos ou potenciais que afetam todo o jogo. Nosso objetivo é formar a maior torre de minions para impressionar o nosso Mestre, quando ele chegar. Acontece que podemos ser traídos por nós mesmos, e pela sorte, por não fazer uma base forte o suficiente para sustentar a torre, além de poder interagir colocando minions mais sanguinários nas torres dos outros pra forçar que elas caiam quando chegar a hora de uma das Brigas Cabulosas. Tema excelente e muito, muito engraçado, com várias referências hilárias nas cartas e nos flavor texts.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game with great art and flavor. The tower building and collapsing mechanic makes for an interesting strategic element that usually ends in laughs. The game is solid and can support up to six people which is a bonus. Only thing to note is that is can be slow for sufferers of analysis paralysis. I recommend this if you want a small game that is full of both strategy, take-that and humor.

RATING: 7
I'm not much of a fan of take-that games, but this one did it for me: instead of attack cards ( "Hit someone with a brick! Ha ha ha."), you have monsters with various characteristics and violent proclivities; for the majority of monsters, whether they're "good" or "bad"  depends - sometimes heavily - on the context of where they're placed relative to what other monsters.

It's a competitive spatial puzzle with bloody, bloody teeth. The closest analogue I can compare it to is "imagine each player has a little tiny Neuroshima Hex-ish tower, where the units in it can kill each other, and everyone can alter anyone's board". 

At 3p, the game went roughly twice as long as I felt like it should for its weight - but was otherwise surprisingly good, and adjusting game length for # of players ought to be pretty simple.

[After a few more plays: it definitely wants deck scaling by player count, the Event Cards can be very swingy, and it's unsatisfying when a bunch of Big Hairy Fight cards cluster close by each other. But I still like it. Giving yourself points is often flat-out better than denying one opponent points, but you do end up with cards which might get you 1-2 points or cost someone else 12 (or which are just hard to play in your own tower without wrecking everything), which in 3-4p seems to lead to a good level of shenanigans.]

This has driven home how much I hate light card games where you try to avoid looking successful so that opponents will beat up on somebody else. Because this has some neat mechanics and spatial puzzles, with a cutely gruesome theme of monsters eating each other, and individual moments are a little fun. But the overall experience is still worthless for me cuz of the dynamic named above.

RATING: 6
Silly funny game. Simple game mechanics that still allows a person to do quite advanced strategies. Good as an introduction for people who are not accustomed to the board-/cardgame world. Showing them there's more funny games than Monopoly.

Though I've only played it a few time but I like it when I want simple games, I believe that you can get bored with it after too many gaming sessions and therefore I mark it an 6/10. Because it is decent, has some re-playability though not that much. But since it is quite cheap it still remains reasonably highly ranked for me.

Loved this game!  The art and text is brilliantly fun.  Just buying the deck to read each card makes this a worthwhile purchase at such a bargain price!  

Highlights:
* Inexpensive
* Great art and humor
* Easy to port around with almost zero set up time
* Huge amount of tactics for such a straight-forward game
* IT'S FUN!

You are a lieutenant of an evil overlord.

That's Good.

And your evil overlord has conquered the entire world.

And that's good.

But it's also bad.

Because Master is depressed now, because he didn't have an emotional endgame for "What am I going to do now that I fulfilled my life's ambitions?"

As such, you are worried that Master is probably going to kill you.

The good news is you have a plan.

The bad new is your plan is stupid.

What better way to cheer up Master than with a cheerleading competition?

This is a game I'd define as filler for gamers. The iconography and rules are a little complicated for such a light card game and mixed with a dungeon type theme the target audience seems a bit restricted. It's is a decent game with great artwork.

A take that game with some depth to it. You have to build towers of minions, but when attacks break out, minions kill each other, which can lead to some really chaotic sequences. This game would be a lot more tolerable if you couldn't play minions into others' towers. As it is, it's very difficult to get much of a tower going, and the minion values are so random that scoring feels like an afterthought. Some good ideas with humorous flavor text, but a little too uncontrollable for my tastes. Gave me a similar vibe to seeing your ship blow up in Galaxy Trucker, along with some tedious combat programming similar to Neuroshima Hex.

Three Cheers is quite wonderful. As a game, it's really enjoyable. But strangely, for a game I guess, that isn't the most enjoyable part. The artwork and theme of this game is just wonderful. Every card is just FUN to look at, read, study and go through. 

I don't think it's my favourite in the collection. But it is 100% worth a play through and the half an hour of your time it'll take to play.

I really like the mechanics of how this game works, but it is not a quick and easy learn. It also takes up a lot of table-space even with just 2 people. Set up doesn't take long at all, but takes about 2-3 games before you really start seeing strategies.

Cute and potentially fun with the right folks. My first play-through was hampered by no one being familiar with the rules (including Yours Truly, the owner) and we fumbled a lot. That took the edge off of the potential for fun, but I'm willing to give it another chance (after I commit the rules to memory).

[thing=175961][/thing] is a pretty weak game - there are choices, regarding the position of the creatures, which one will be up, or down, considering their pendor to agression, defenses and other special abilities or weakness. Still, with all the varied ways that players can attack and be attacked  - from messing with the structure of your tower to receive creatures put by the others, both actions that can destroy your whole work.

There is little in terms of defense - overall, you are just at the mercy of the others, and the more players you have, more chaotic the play will get and the less control you will have.

Gameplay is quite easy: play one or two cards, may discard one, fill hand to three. When a battle cards comes, the creatures in the towers will fight among themselves, which may cause ruin to some towers with the killings, as minions may fall down, puting them in position to cause even more havoc in the next fight, and so on. The winner will be the person that scores the most point with her tower at the end, and the creatures are worth more the higher they are.

[thing=175961][/thing] give decisions to the players, but only to take the value of them away almost immediately. Too bad, since the dynamic of the internal positioning of creatures and their powers could provide a better game experience. As it is, the greatest quality of [thing=175961][/thing] is its art, which is excellent! In the end, [thing=175961][/thing] is a weak game, quite random, with a lot of "take that", and one with few attractives to me. I don't recommend it.

RATING: 7.5
Evil but fun little 'take that' game - players create towers for the pleasure of the 'master' which their minion must climb to win. Fun variable powers amongst the 'cheerleading' minions making up the tower can be supportive if played on your own tower or evil played on an opponent's. Great fun, fairly simple rules, takes about 1/2 - 3/4hr.

Three Cheers for Master is a fun and light card game for up to six players. Thus far I've only played with up to three, but I can only imagine that the game gets better with the more people you add. The gameplay itself is chaotic and mean. Throughout the session you'll build a cheerleading tower of minions, while occasionally doing what you can to sabotage and destroy other peoples towers. The traits and gravity mechanic and where the game really shines, with some minions heavy enough to crush those beneath them, and some hungry enough to eat the weaklings. All in all, a fun and quick game of a very casual nature.

I'm not sure I had the best first play of this as we seemed to be playing off the idea of the player aid more than with the actual rules... but it seems that there is an interesting enough spatial card game with a lot of take that moves here.  Probably too much take that for my tastes in the end, but I do like that just about every card gives you the choice of using it beneficially or playing it on someone else as a take that card giving you a lot of choice over where and how you build yourself up and where and how you screw other people over.  The art is creepily charming and the quotes on the cards made me laugh a few times so I'd like to try this again once the owner actually reads the rules.

Rules are not really dynamic. Same rules will get blocked again and again and some others don't just matter anything. Also too long to this kind of game in which every round is basically copy of another. Also contains lot of kingmaking.

RATING: 7
Amazing game. It takes the idea of bridge (which I enjoy too) and makes it so interesting. The fact you have to decide what the rules of the round are on the board by elimination means that every hand you have might be a potential killer or dud. You can also hedge and try to steer the rules to ones that are safer or risk a risky rule to play and score big. The rules that people eliminate also tells you something about their hand if you are paying attention. 
Downsides are the theme is non existent although the art is very nice and also some people find it very hard not to transmit information about their hand to their teammates which breaks the game's fairness to those who do follow that rule. 
Overall, has strategic value, very fun and highly recommended.

RATING: 8
I'm really surprised by how much I enjoy Nyet, being someone that doesn't usually like trick-taking games - especially those that don't change a lot about the classic formula. Yet for some reason I find this one to be really entertaining.

Sure, I'll admit that part of this enjoyment comes from the stunning artwork, which is so beautiful that immediately draws people in, but beneath all the shiny pictures there's also a pretty good filler game. In fact Nyet introduces two simple but very interesting twists on the genre. The "rules-drafting", or Nyet Phase, brings a nice layer of tactics, as you have to pick carefully which rule to exclude from the upcoming round to get an advantage over the other players. This mechanism also manages to grant some variability to the game, which is always a good thing. The second twist is the fact that each round you play in team with someone else... and this is maybe the part that surprised me the most! I really enjoy this almost semi-cooperative element, that is able to spice things up, while still keeping everything simple.

Overall, even if at the end of the day you end up playing a few hands of cards and following suit, Nyet managed to win me over, where a lot of other trick-taking games failed. It's a very good game, splendidly produced and I enjoy it quite a bit!

Classic trick-taking game structure, with rules that change over time. Do you like games like Hearts? Do you like playing them over and over again? Can you live with taking massive hits to your points and not feeling too burned to keep playing? Unless you say yes to all those, there are better uses of your time.

The art and packaging is wonderful, and I was willing to stick it out to the end of at least one full session, but one bad round turned the BF off this game completely, and we require more than a couple mechanics to our games when they require as much time as this would.

Pros: I really like the start of the round - going around and eliminating results until you know the full rules of the hand you're playing. That was super fun (the game where the tricks were -2 points was particularly fun). I also like the variable partners.

Cons: Rules were not super clear. There were a couple parts (particularly scoring) that needed to be clearer.

If you are a fan of trick taking games with trumps but you don't know what to play, then this is the trick taking game of choice.  Every round is a new game with new "rules".  Prior to the round beginning but after the hands after dealt, the players bid for what will be trump, which card is highest, etc.  Every hand is like a new game and the result is a whole lot of fun.  The perfect candidate for an 'ultimate trick taking game'. [GTI: AGCL]

The bidding takes too long and could have had much more interesting decision (such as a Nyet on Trump and Nyet on super trump, or even two nyets that both have to be cancelled). The card play is fairly obvious. 

Strictly worse than public domain trick taking games, IMO.

Like Was Sticht? this trick taking card game has a set-up phase each hand, though in this case you are determining the rules for that hand.  That change doesn't stop it suffering from the same problem - too much time spent before playing any cards, and time spent making the card playing not that interesting.

-----------------------
The game has some interesting mechanisms, but seems to have a serious run away leader problem.  While the "team" aspect sounds cool, it can make it super tough for players to get back in the game.  Wouldn't mind playing more and exploring this one further, but at first glance the game does seem to have a few issues.

RATING: 8
Played as part of Mu & Lots More. I really like this one. The first phase of the game definitely alleviates the annoyance of being dealt a bad hand that is inherent in most card games. Tuning the rules of the game to suit your hand is absolutely brilliant. I love the tension of trying to get your opponents to make certain moves on the board to your advantage, and the agony of having to make moves that might help them. The importance of 0s also adds a little extra spice and strategy to what is otherwise a pretty standard trick taking affair. My only concern is it might have a bit of a runaway leader problem... need to play more to see how big of an issue that is.

I like this one.  It's a trick taking card game where part of the game is to set the rules of the game.  That is, what's trump, what's super-trump, who goes first, what the teams are.  That portion is where most of the bluffing and tactical manuevering lie.  Then it becomes a trick taking card game with many of the standard elements of that genre.

(Original Edition)

Njet! is an excellent partnership based trick-taking game. The central hook of the play is the initial Njet phase where players take turns placing chips that will govern what the trump suit is, what the uber-trumps are, who the start player is, and what books will be worth. The start player chooses a partner (likely based on their chip play in the early phase) and the trick taking proceeds. You are supposed to play X number of deals where X equals player count times two.

I like this game a lot, it presents an interesting twist on a genre of card games that I absolutely love though, so my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. I love variable partnerships too, and this offers that as well. The only tweak that I would prefer to see is playing to a set point total rather than X deals as the rules state because I think card games can be much too anti-climatic when they're played with a set deal count, as it can mean insurmountable leads are created which takes some players out of the game and makes it less interesting and fun for them. Otherwise cool game though, one I hope to play more in the near future.

Aside: playing to point totals is definitely preferable for me. 250 makes for a fairly long game. 150 is just right for a normal gaming session. I also prefer to have players use color differentiated discs rather than the black ones to bid in the Njet! phase so everyone can see at a glance what choices each player made initially. (Note that this is included as standard in the newer edition).

Trick taking-game with a twist. I like trick taking for short whiles, despite the fact that I suck at it because I cannot properly remember the cards already played. What makes this game even harder is the fact that you team up, so in addition to I have to glean information from the small board positioned between the players. I suck at [i]that[/i], too. Njet! is far too much a guessing game I do not do well at. It is by no means a bad game as trick taking games go, it's just not something for me.

Production: The production quality is excellent, with simple yet elegant cards (designed to look used and weathered), a sturdy board, wooden chips, and a nice, compact score pad.  Play: I enjoy the partners aspect of the game, and the fact that players have no incentive to not help their partners.  The trick-taking is straight forward; I find that the heart of the game lies in the token-placement phase, and I've yet to get a real handle on this aspect of the game.  As one commentator points out, the elimination of options leads toward mediocre hands for everyone.  (3+1+3) (2 plays)

Just ok. I like the idea of picking different team players each round and selecting the variable controls for how each round plays out. Just found in our ten plays or so there wasn't much variability in how the scoring worked and who was winning. Once someone got a lead it was hard to reign them back in.

RATING: 6
The 60-card version packaged in Mu and Lots More handles up to five players and, supposedly, as few as two, although the game for two leaves something to be desired. The five-player game, in which the starting player names his partner and then the two of them take on the other three, works pretty well. The pre-hand selection of parameters usually will not give you much info to go on in the choice of partners. Conventional bidding or naming a card works better. On the other hand, you cannot really "go set" (It's just points per trick with no target to achieve.), so the game is friendlier than some other partnership trick-taking games.

Nyet! grabbed my attention because of the Nyet! phase at the beginning of each round. Here, the players determine the rules of the round by eliminating all but one rule for discarding, trumps, supertrumps, start player and value of tricks. Reading about this, I thought this would be an interesting twist but after trying it, I'm a little disappointed: Once it's your turn, someone else has probably eliminated the suit you're strong in, so you kill a suit that you're weak in. If this doesn't work, you try to knock out the big points and so on. In the end, everyone seems to play with more or less the same mediocre hands. The starting player has the advantage to choose their partner and maybe you can select someone with a hand that complements your hand based on the voting but we couldn't make this work in our games. The selection felt more or less random, although this could have been because of our inexperience.

In the end, Nyet! was missing that special spark that makes me love a lot of "classic" trick-takers and I'm not sure if it will hit the table again, although I would really like to try it three players again. Maybe it shines at that player count (until now I've only played it with four).

Cool little board where after each hand is dealt, the player place their tokens to eliminate things like trump suits and scoring values.  Then the hand is played.

Light trick taking game from Stefan Dorra. After the hand has been dealt and examined, players begin voting off trumps, supertrumps, number of discards, points the tricks are worth, and who will be start player. An early form of reality television? Not too taxing, and seems rather luck dependant. Not too sure if it is though. Definitely worth a look.

Really interesting twist on a trick taking game. After looking at your hand you must quickly decide what to eliminate for that round and the second part of the turn is playing out the tricks.

There is a 2x bonus card when playing with odd numbers and it is not very balanced and skews the game slightly. The art work is really good and fits the theme well but ultimately when compared to Black Spy it falls a little short.

Njet is a trick-taking game for teams in which the players can change the rules (within limits) before each round by vetoing some of the available options. Who vetoes what sends some signals about the players' hands which can be valuable when teams are selected afterwards.
 
The game works perfectly fine, but ultimately runs a little long for the amount of guessing involved, especially in the team formation step.

Der Atem des Todes der Sowjetunion wehte noch durch die Welt als Stefan Dorra 1997 nach MARRACASH sein vermutlich zweites ewiges Werk erfand: NJET ist nicht nur ein auÃerordentlich simples-schÃ¶nes Stichspiel in postkommunistischer Gestalt eines herunter transformierten Doppelkopf, sondern auch eine Hommage an die unfreiwilligen Popcodes des Warschauer Pakts als Verzerrung der kommunistischen Idee in Form eines Staatsapparat, der sich kÃ¼nstlich klamm und arm hielt: die gestaltete Patina auf den Karten und der trashige Look der Legetafel mit den schwarzen Scheiben in der Goldsieber-Ausgabe war schon vor 20 Jahren genial. Mir ein RÃ¤tsel, warum das iello-Remake bei aller WertschÃ¤tzung dieses visuelle Zitat glattgebÃ¼gelt und den russischen BÃ¤ren und sibirischen Wolf zu lustigen Figuren degradiert hat. Andererseits spiegelt genau diese "SÃ¤uberung" eben auch das MissverstÃ¤ndnis vermeintlicher Konsum-Makellosigkeit wieder, die jede Kante marktkonform ausmerzen will und gleichzeitig so sehr nach IndividualitÃ¤t und Einzigartigkeit schreit. Das Spiel selbst ist einfach groÃartig: jede Runde definieren die Spieler selbst die Kriterien nach denen sie spielen wollen indem sie mit den schwarzen Scheiben einfach Dinge nacheinander ausschliessen: Startspieler, Trumpffarbe, hÃ¶chster Trumpf, PunktehÃ¶he pro Stich etc. Das spiegelt den Geist der Planwirtschaft witzig wider. Dazu noch die Ã¼blichen Bedien- und ein paar spezielle Trumpfregeln und fertig ist ein tolles Stichspiel mit Hammer, Sichel und Rotem Stern statt Karo, Herz und Kreuz. Auch wenn linke, gemeinschaftlich organisierte Gesellschaft nie so gemeint war wie in der alten Sowjetunion und ihren Satellitenstaaten, so ist NJET doch ein schÃ¶nes Symbol: wÃ¤hrend das Design von NJET absichtlich "kaputt" ist, ist es in Wahrheit der Glam und Glitter der kapitalen Waren- und Kaufhauswelt. Daher sagen wir Njet zum gestylten Reprint von iello und nehmen alle das Original von Goldsieber. DafÃ¼r findet sich in unserem Spielekreis jederzeit eine internationale Spielgemeinschaft.

A gamer's trick taking game. You start each game by "bidding" on the rules of the game and the point value (after seeing your hand)

Once the rules are set, the game is played in a team fashion, which is interesting. I'm not sure how much I like that yet because it can create some odd situations but I can see why they did it that way

I'm not a big fan of trick-taking games in the first place, but the pre-round rules determination (although innovative) makes this game take way too long to play. Run-away leaders and restrictive trumps are also problematic. "In Mother Russia, trick-taking games play YOU."

I haven't played many modern trick taking games and it isn't a favourite genre of mine, but I really like this implementation of it. I like the added loot rule and supertrumps, they're simple but adds some more interesting choices. I think the nyet round adds a lot to the formula and it means that pretty much any hand can be great. There's some group think during the bidding which is fun but can be quite swingy and while I like the shifting teams both for strategic and variability reasons, it leads to a big problem with the game. The final round will inevitably be anticlimactic, because once the teams are formed unless both players are exactly even in scores one player on each team will have no chance of winning the game. It also affects the bidding for first player in the final round a bit too much. Another smaller complaint is that the -2 will almost never happen since only 1 player needs to have a good hand for it to be denied. It also means that when it happens everyone will have bad hands, so it's not as fun. One of my favourite mechanics in classic trick-taking games is bidding 0, and while it's sort of in this game, due to the bidding it's not really a thing.

RATING: 6
The trick play is very light and straightforward, but the "Njet!" phase in which the rules are created is quite interesting.  I recommend coloring or numbering the markers so that you can easily remember which player played them.  Knowing how players have bid is very important for choosing partners and for predicting the card distribution.  I prefer to play once around the table (4 rounds) instead of twice.  I haven't played it with three players yet, but it appears that it would be better with three than with four (more interesting "Njet" phase, less chance of voids, more importance on being the start player, and the crucial decision of whether to play alone or with a partner).  Use the final-round variant linked at Rick Heli's website.

The card play is standard trick-taking fare (fun) with some hidden information if you're playing without a full complement (not all the cards are dealt for 2 or 3 players). That's fun and â¦ tricky.

The bidding adds its own element of subtle tactical bluffing, which is fun. It might take slightly too long, but if you can move the game along in this phase, Nyet is fast.

As far as trick taking games go, this is an absolute keeper for a quick filler game to us.  It plays smoothly, it adds the entire betting aspect (which traditionally we're not fans of, but it just works so well in this game), and it scales well with all counts of players we've tried it with.

RATING: 9
Nyet is a traditional trick-taking game with a pre-trick-taking round in which players choose what properties will not be in play for the round makes the game what it is: "Trump is Nyet red, comrade!" This becomes a subtle wink to those around the table, a means of jockeying for position when picking fruitful and not so fruitful partnerships. The shifting alliances in this game are a real riot -- the possibility for negative trick hands really make this game shine. A clever twist on a timeless style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Trick Taking with a strange bidding scheme, in which players forbid certain hand parameters, with the last item available being what determines the rules. Trump, super-trump, passing, and partnerships are determined this way. It's pretty clever, although the changing partnerships can lead to endgame issues--only the top player of each team actually has a chance, and their partners' play is largely meaningless on the last hand. It's not a deal-breaker for me but something to be aware of.

Not too fond of the Soviet iconography but the art is sweet.

1st played 1/7/08. Taught in ~5min, played (5 hands) ~1hr w/ 5 players. This is a team game & has some strategy in it. Deck has 4 suits each w/ cards 0-9 with 3 zeros & 4 sevens in it. Each player is dealt 12 cards then dealer's left places a disc over an option he doesn't want this round. Options have 5 categories with 5 options each. Once 4 of 5 options are covered for a category, the remaining option left is played for the round. Categories are: players (5 listed with last deciding who picks teams & who gets card doubler), cards discarded (1, 2, 2 w/o 0's, pass 2 to left, & void), trump suits (red, blue, grey, yellow & no trump), supertrump (4 colors, no trump) & trick value (1,2,3,4,or -2). Zero's captured are worth a trick unless it's used to capture the trick. Since there are extra zeros & sevens, ties are won by the last one played. Teams are two & three. The team is at a bit of a disadvantage since they are outnumbered, however one of them get the doubler which doubles the value of their tricks (counting zeros). This is a fun game that I'd recommend giving a try if you know someone who has it, however you probably wouldn't purchase for this game alone.

NJET Oct08: Now this is a cool little game.  I really like the bidding style of taking turns deciding what you don't want.  The only issue is that it reduces the likelihood of having a really lopsided hand since most people will down vote stuff they are short in very quickly.

Overall I am a little disappointed but I guess that is because I waited so long to play it (after seeing pretty high praise from some) and I have played quite a few good trick games already. 

The trick taking is standard fare and pretty light overall (and not as good or interesting as dorras other trick game Die Sieben Segal), the crux of the game is the NJET phase where players determine things like trump or no trump, tricks worth points or worth negative points, discard options, supertrump and start player, these are decided by players taking turns eliminating things one at a time until only one thing in each category is left.  These options are a great mix and I have a good mind to use this system in a couple of other trick-taking games (and some of them are already in other games like Doppercoff and Bridge [NT] ). It seems to me Dorra might have borrowed a little from Watten here, they are quite different but both have a scheme of betting (quite different though) and both use a trump suit and trump rank.  

I think two house rules will help this game a little, the obvious one is in the last round there are NO teams which solves the main complaint.  I also think that during the regular game the Start player when won can CHOOSE whether to go alone or be on a team so maybe no teams in certain rounds, makes the start player a little more powerful and spices the game up a little more.  

Not sure about the captured zero rules, usually you will want to throw them away unless clearing a suit so those are your choices for discard, also found the rule where if red was played and red zeros were supertrump you had to follow suit a little strange.  Still a good trick game with a nice unique take on it with the intitial vying for options.

I played the new version without realizing that I already owned this game as part of MÃ¼ & Lots More. That box has been sitting on my shelf for many a year as I love trick-takers and I want to play them, but I don't think the players around me love them as much as I do.

I really enjoy the bidding on the aspects of the game (trump, points, etc.) based on what is in my hand. Playing in partnership makes the game even better and the communication through bidding is similar to bridge, although you pick your potentially best partner when you go first AFTER the bidding. My instinct tells me this will become a staple in my collection, but I can't rate it any higher yet with the brief play that I had. Can't believe I've had this good trick-taker hidden in my collection for so long! There are some changes in the new version that look like good changes to me. "No trump" has been removed as an option (apparently it got picked too often) and the blocking tokens indicate who blocked what, which seems a serious aid in picking your partner. It appears the card distro might be different as well, looking through my deck for comparison.

Njet is a standard trick taking game except for the preparatory Njet-phase where players define the rules of the trick anew each round. Who is start player, what colour is trump, is there a super trump, how many points will players get and will cards be discarded before playing the trick. Additionally, the starting player gets to choose a partner for this round.  A solid game for fans of trick-takers that runs a bit long.

My old Goldsieber edition differs from the reimplementations in limiting the players to four, the number of cards, the distribution of numbers and a minor difference in the rules bidding table.

I like the idea of the Njet! phase, but in my experience I've had next to no control in choosing the trump/supertrump/start player etc.  I like the partnership aspect of the game, but with so few cards, it's very likely that at least one player is out of a suit before any cards are even played.  This seems like a nice step up from simple trick taking games.  It's not mindblowing, but can be a lot of fun and lasts just about the right amount of time.  I also like the Soviet-themed art on the cards.

I think the most interesting and fun decisions in trick-taking games are in deciding how you're going to play out your hand. Njet amplifies these decisions with the board phase and also makes you adapt the strategy of what you'll do based on how the board is shaping out and who you think you'll partner with. Great stuff, a classic game. I don't love trick-taking games but Njet! is special.

RATING: N/A
In each opening round of the trick-taking card game Nyet!, players take turns crossing out possible choices for starting player, trump, super trump, the number of cards you discard, and the value of tricks taken on a grid, leaving only one option in each category. Once the starting player is determined, that player chooses a partner, then the teams play out the round based on the conditions they collectively chose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun card game where you spend time eliminating people from being the start player, how many discards/passes, what is trump, what is supertrump, and how many points each trick and opponent's zero is worth.  Then, games play out according to those newly established rules according to usual trick taking convention rules.  A bit chaotic and hard to plan due to the nature of how trump and such is selected, its still an interesting exercise where observing what people eliminate gives you clues as to who to possibly match up with as a partner....but if in doubt, just pick Bruce!  After playing with three, I must admit that seemed to be a sweet spot where there was much more control.  Play with much more, and there will be much less control, particularly with five.  What's also interesting in playing with 4, is that set partners will become established if there is a significant difference in scores after one hand.  This may require a person to intentionally lose to be allowed an opportunity to break back into the game as someone else's partner and thus jump ahead from second place to first place.  This is something you must always keep an eye out for in your game.

While not as good as other  4 player trick taking games (e.g., Tichu) it is a good game that I would like to play again and can accommodate 3 or 5 players.  The bidding mechanism works well and is visual (hence not as dependent on memory or split second attention), and the loot taking is a nice twist.  Teams are variable and add another strategic dimension.  I can see it as having good replayability with all the different options.  It can be played in 3, 4, or 5, and is quick.  I would probably choose it when there are fewer or more than 4 players as an alternative trick taking card game.

The Njet phase really makes the game, but it can be hard to tell whether a player has is strong in an area or just weaker in the area that has been nixed.  If you are strong in a suit, you can be pretty sure that it will not be trump.  Scoring may require some tweaking to perfect the game.  The character art is a bit hard to differentiate.

A unique 4-player trick-taking game where players take turn eliminating the attributes that will determine how the round is played out.  Once one is left in each category: Start Player, Trump Colour, Super Trump Colour, Points per trick, Number of Discards then the first player pics a partner and a round is played using the rules determined.  Looking foward to playing it again soon and often.

There's nothing really wrong with Nyet, it just doesn't differentiate itself from games like Hearts enough to make me want to play it more. Yes, there's the whole process of setting parameters for the hand you're about to play, but I think only trick-taking connoisseurs are going to appreciate this aspect. I don't know that I get as much enjoyment from this as others probably do. So while I do think there is an audience for this game, and the idea of setting the parameters for a hand is cool in theory, it still feels too close to Hearts for me to get a lot of enjoyment from it.

MORE trick-taking! But this time, the twist has to do with setup at the start of each round. Players collectively determine the parameters of each round - what suit is trump, how many points each card is worth, who plays first, etc. It's a nifty twist on a classic genre.

RATING: 6
Standard trick-taking game with a prelude before each hand where players use worker placement to knock out the various options on offer for discards, trumps, supertrumps, start player and points each trick is worth. I thought this would be interesting, but in practice you get such little control - by the time your turn comes around, someone's probably already knocked out your big suit (because they've only got 1 of them), so then you knock out the suit you're short in, which means you need to get lucky when it comes around to your turn to have only two options left to allow you to finalise it with what you want. Or end up playing no trumps most hands. If the trumps didn't go your way, then knock out the big point spots, ensuring those with the best hands get limited points. All of which means the exercise falls flat, playing similar hands with not many points up for grabs. The start player advantage is that they get to choose their partner, which you do based on what they knocked out in a relatively blind hope that they've got something that supplements your hand. Or do it based on score (ie pick who's coming last). It's not very inspirational, and the game play is standard so there's not much to excite there either. I was hoping for more.

I've had the Mu and Lots More box for ages, but hadn't got round to playing this (recently reprinted) Stefan Dorra tricktaker. I'm a sucker for Tricktakers with a Twist, and I enjoyed this one too. The twist is the bidding round before each hand when the players gradually eliminate options for how the hand will be played (trump suit, value of tricks etc.) until only one set remains.

March 2017: Not good at odd numbers. Especially not at 3. Despite the solo player getting double points, the other partnership has a much bigger advantage by taking advantage of each other's strengths (i.e. passing the lead back and forth between yourself and your partner). There are many excellent 2-against-1 partnership games; this is not one of them. 

Being able to pick your partner is quite powerful, as long as you're paying attention!

January 2016: Upgrade from 6 to 7. This is excellent at three players. Much more control in the bidding.

I am agreeing much more with the comments criticizing the partnership rules in this game. Players should score for what their team took [b]and[/b] the number of tricks they took individually.

Too bad the card quality isn't that great, nor the art (other than the player ID cards).

November 2015: The new version is so, so much better than the one packaged with Mu: In this one, there is only one 7, not 3. Too many duplicate cards in a trick-taking game is frustrating.

But my feeling towards the game hasn't changed despite this; it's no fun to play average hands all the time.

September 2015: I love the idea of the game, but the trick play isn't that exciting. The mechanism that determines the nature of the game ensures that everyone has "average" hands.

Also, it's somewhat unfortunate that Njet! has been packaged with Mu, which implements a unique bidding mechanism and the ability to choose partners much better. 

The issue with trick taking games with bidding and variable partnerships is that the bidding might give away too much information ensuring that the most compatible hands end up on the same team. (Perhaps that's why a lot of traditional trick taking games with variable partnerships involve picking a player who holds a particular card, and that partner doesn't reveal him or herself until he or she plays that card.) Njet! cleverly solves this by the fact that that information learned during the "bidding" round is often very unreliable. But this unreliability makes the bidding round not as satisfying.

controlling a variable set of trick taking rules is clever.  Best when played in teams of 2, so that the team has a bit more strategic control over the board.  Played without teams, your agency over the rules is a little bit low (but the game is still solid).

Best trick-taking game I've played. The bidding phase where you get to nix which suits are Trump or whether tricks will be worth a little, a lot, or negative, or how important it is for you to choose your partner - ingenious!!! This kills Hearts for me, as well as Tichu.  People complain about the game length, but that's because most trick-taking games don't have a set # of rounds - it's not much longer than 8 rounds of Hearts (or endless rounds of Tichu).

As a French Canadian, though I don't actually speak the language, I spent my childhood playing card games with my VERY French grandmother. We played a lot of games, but the most popular one, when we had 4 players, was always Euchre. I loved it, and looked forward to the times I got to play it with my grandmother. Nyet takes most of what you know about Euchre and throws it on steroids, and surprisingly makes it playable with both 3 and 5 player counts in addition to the standard 4. I still love Euchre, but I can't see a reason to ever play it again when this is available, with the exception of sentimental value.

RATING: 9
Really great trick taking game. You can't say how you want the rules of the round to go, only how you don't want it to go, so you have to decide what's really important it isn't. And the first player picking their partner is great as well, as they have to use the board to try to determine who might possibly have a good hand to go along with the rules, often guessing incorrectly. The changing rules and dynamic partners each round keeps the game super interesting and a lot of fun.

Two minor criticisms: 8 rounds seemed like a very long time. I was kind of wanting the game to end after about 5 rounds. as I had gotten my fill, but then I had to keep doing it for three more rounds. It was great fun still, don't get me wrong, but the added phase of chosing the rules slows it down compared to your average trick taking game. Secondly, it has rules for a two player variant, and I tried sitting down to play it that way one night, and had an awful experience working together to try to figure out what it meant.

RATING: 5
I have played the MÃ¼ and Lots More version, but am commenting on the original version anyway.

Well, in theory the board should lead to some interesting choices before the card play begins, but the reality is that it's just not that tense and interesting. The board starts off with so many choices that amongst the lack of control a player can easily block off a suit or negative scoring or a starting player or possibly all three before they find the options have almost run out and it doesn't matter much anymore. What's left is a semi intelligent guess at choosing a partner, or just sitting and hoping to be chosen, then the familiar card play begins.

AT THIS POINT I SHOULD MENTION THAT SUPERTRUMPS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ROLLED INTO THE NORMAL TRUMPS SUIT - DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES STATING THAT COLOURS ARE FOLLOWED AND INCLUDE SUPERTRUMPS AS THEIR ORIGINAL COLOURS. IT SEEMS THAT'S AN OVERSIGHT WHEN TAKEN LITERALLY IN THE RULES. You'll enjoy it more if you do it this way, believe me.

The version of Njet! I played shares box space with MÃ¼ and it's main problem is that it's the clearly inferior game. They share this similarity of two separate halves to a hand, but where MÃ¼ is tantalising and agonising and teasing, Njet! is pedestrian and not really very interesting. It's okay for variety, but that's it.

What I would recommend is playing with an odd number - MÃ¼ and Lots More allows players to play with five. The dragon allocation adds a slightly more interesting element to the start player role and makes blocking other start players a more worthy choice than in a four player game.

Disappointing. On paper, the game variable selection mechanic seems like it would generate some intriguing player interactions, but in practice most of the choices end up shaking out pretty much the same way each time. The "loot" mechanic does add an interesting wrinkle to traditional trick-taking, and teases an extra strategic layer out of the low cards in the deck.

I've always had a soft spot for trick taking games as Euchre was a game I was taught at an early age by my family.

I was so glad to find a game that took the trick taking elements I loved and changed them up just enough to breathe new life into an already beloved genre.

I will never say no when asked to play this one which is really good as it is one of the most requested titles when visitors come over for game night.

Normaly I dislike trick taking trump suit games, but Njet allows for everyone to control the game based on what hand they were dealt.  There are so many fun decisions to be made to help your position as others cut down your hand, then you play the results.  There is a great charm to the game and the design works well with the theme.  If people are concerned about the endgame in the 8th round then they should just keep all points hidden until the game ends, and say that whoever partners with the winner comes in second. Third and fourth place are then determined by points.

Certainly one of the greatest hidden classics.

Owned in MÃ¼ & Lots More.  Nyet! is a Dorra-designed trick taker with a number of twists.  Each hand, before playing any cards, players determine the twists by slowly eliminating alternatives.  In the process, information is revealed and partners are chosen.  The end-game is an anticlimax; it becomes obvious who is and is not going to win earlier than I'd like.

[Goldsieber 1997 edition] {trick-taking, partnership, bidding; optimal 4p} Njet! is a special trick-taking game. Player need not bid for the number of tricks to make but they will have to determine several aspects of game (start players, # of cards to play, trumpt, score, etc.) before starting the trick-taking part. The 'bidding' part is unique and is the cornerstone of the game. Most of the tactics and strategies come from this part.

In all, a very good trick-taking game. Fun, interactive and tactical. It should be in every trick-taking collection.

[New edition] I am interested in the new rule of Njet! However, I already owned 3 of the 4 games in "4 in 1" :(

Played with the last round without teams, because it just seems a bit hard to be a 'team player' when you're behind and can't win. Another option might be to play to a score rather than a set number of rounds (opening up the possibility of a team member throwing a round to prevent their pertness getting over the line). Also could be an interesting idea to try a variant where you have the chance to choose ONE condition to occur, sacrificing all of your markers to make this happen (e.g. choose red as trump, but don't get to place markers anywhere else).

I enjoyed playing it as did the others at the table but I found the bidding process a little too slow.

--
On one hand the bidding provides quite a lot of information but the problem is that information is so piecemeal, even using colored tokens for each player, that it was hard to deduce anything useful. 
The game works quite by making things everyone's least hated option which serve to somewhat balance out the deal but in some respects I think it might make more sense to to play Da, where each player sets one of trump/discard/points/start player. The options for bluffing (for partners) or blocking would still be there but the process would be much faster.

A really nice trick-taking game, and with the addition of swapping teams and the changing rulestate for each round, there is some great variety in the gameplay!

Our group of 5 were able to get through 5 rounds in an hour, and I don't think we were playing slow, so at this rate, I doubt we'd ever play a full 10-round game (as stated in the rules).

This game is currently my favorite trick-taking game, hope to get more games in soon!

Da! Love this one, although the endgame does have a flaw: If your partner is ahead in score during the final hand, you can't win. A variant we've added: Adding a no-trump space (in addition to the no supertrump) allows all four players to place an even number of Nyet! markers - 4 - each turn, eliminating a very slight disadvantage for one player.

RATING: 8
Most trick-taking games try to deal with the luck of the draw in a couple of different ways. One is to try to make low cards valuable in some way (Sticheln, Bottle Imp), so that you don't get screwed if you get a hand of all low cards. Another method is to have some sort of system where you bid on how many tricks you expect to take so you can bid low if you have a bad hand (Wizard).

Nyet seems to take on a whole new approach. Before the game the players look at their hand of cards and then, one at a time, cancel out various factors until one of each type remains. The factors include how much tricks will be worth (they can even be worth negative points), which suit is trump, will cards be discarded or passed, and so on. 

Other than that, you have a very, very basic trick-taking game. You have to follow suit, high card wins unless a trump is played. Each trick is worth so many points (or negative points). 

I'm pretty sure I'm going to love it, but no rating yet until I play a full game.

I finally FOUND a copy!! and couldn't be more excited. The cards and components are really great, plus its a way fun game. I'm so glad to have a copy of this game.

Very dull.  The &quot;negative bidding&quot; system encourages mediocre hands, and the endgame is a big problem.

Fun changing partnership trick-taking game with Dorra's extra special genius. It's very frustrating to watch what could be a great hand turn into crap as people slowly eliminate the good possibilities. Very balancing in that way too, as it will be very rare to get a truly powerful hand from the luck of the draw, and if you have a really bad hand, you can just make the score multiplier for that round go down. There are some end-game issues and the 1-4 multiplier creates some wild swings, but this is overall a great trick-taker with a theme that works surprisingly well.

I love the art. I love the box. My first play was not impressive. I might try try again, but I'm doubtful it would change.

Has some fairly interesting and tough decisions, but the gameplay isn't as fun as other, similar options available.  The combination of full team scoring and a set number of rounds also leads to an almost guaranteed lame duck situation.

Has been a great trick taking game.  Great alternative to Spades and Euchre as teams are fluid and everyone is playing for themselves.  Nice mitigation between skill and luck.

trick tacking with advanced bidding, each player can use a bid token to prevent a certain from being trump. so that the remaining one not bidded one is selected. works same with points etc

A really neat trick taking card game.  You use a board and pips to set up the rules for the game, choosing the trump suit, possibly a super trump, how many point the books are worth and who goes first.  This process helps you identify who likely has what type of hand and the fist player then choose who their partner for the turn will be.  Really, cool idea.  Love it!  I understand the game has been re-done with some differences in Mu and More, but I don't see how you could hardly improve this game.  As a side note, the art and theme (while just for ambiance) is very entertaining.  Overall, a very fine game.

 Trick taking game where prior to the play of the hand players take turns selecting events that they do NOT want to occur, e.g. that red NOT be the trump suit. Players continue placing black chits on top of all the possible options they don't want to have happen until only one space is left open in each category, and those are the conditions under which the current hand will be played. The graphics of the cards are also amazing.

The vetoing of certain options to create the characteristics of each hand in this trick-taking game is something I've never seen in this type of game.  The fact that you have to pick a partner based on what other players have vetoed gives the game a certain dynamic that keeps you engaged during the process.  My only problem is the way the game gives both partners the same score; as such, it's easy for whomever's in the lead to guarantee a win just by picking the player who is just behind him in points, but if you make sure that the person leading the game never starts a round, this could probably be prevented.

I really like the Nyet phase, great idea. Unfortunately the rest of the game is a not-very-interesting trick taker. Sentiment was felt around the table as others likened it to whist or hearts, it really didn't feel this needed to be packaged as an original game. Art on the edition I played was nice.

Trick-taking with a variable partnership. In the last round you can be in a situation where you cannot win the game.

A fun trick taking game.  I am not an aficionado of the genre, so I don't know where it ranks in the pantheon.

I'd be happy to play this anytime someone wants to play a trick taking game, however.

The double layer part, first how the score and trump is played and then actually playing it, really makes it a lot of fun.

I like trick-taking games, as this one hits a sweet spot complexity wise. Players don't choose trump, but take turns vetoing certain options (and determine a supertrump, starting player and points per trick in the same way). After the settings are known, the starting player has to pick his partner for the round, where the vetoes really help to pick the right one.

The only trick taking game I like. The players get to decide the parameters of the following round (what is trump, how many to discard, who goes first, etc) and that is what makes it so interesting. Simple and fast.

Favors experience - first time players will be crushed. After that, it's probably just an extremely fast abstract that favors quick thinking over true strategy. Feels gimmicky to me like all of Looney's games. Stinky.

RATING: 5.5
I'm sure that chess would be a nice and quirky game if people would drop the whole turn-based malarkey, and played it real time, but would it be a better game?

It is tempting to think highly of all games in the Icehouse family, simply because they are based on a clever and highly flexible idea that uses damn sexy stackable pyramids, and because the family has Zendo sitting at the head of the table. In my mind, exposure to Zendo is like staring at the sun too long: you start to see halos in places where there are none. Sure, you can play lots of other games with this set, but none of that makes IceTowers a better, or worse, game. I've never seen anyone adjust their Go rating since the stones can be used to play a whole variety of other games on its board, I am not gonna treat IceTowers differently.

There aren't many games that are played real time, and IceTowers makes great use of the stackable nature of the pieces. The 3 basic moves open up enough options to make game-play interesting, and the amount of pieces seems pitched just right. But the real wild card is the speed with which the players work their ways through the opening moves, and the ability of players to spot these moves quickly. Strangely, after a flash in the pan opening, the game slows down rapidly, as the amount of moves available to players shrinks faster than the amount of tips left visible. I expected it to be played at breakneck speed all the way through, and it sure starts like that, but all of a sudden each game will pasue, when players take time to analyse their remaining options, and then analyse some more. It is inevitable that one or two players will gain genuine control over the remainder of the game, as their moves will dictate which opponent's pieces are liberated, and made available for follow-up moves, and which ones are kept permanently locked out.

It will also become clear that a fast-thinking player ought to win [i]every[/i] game, although a few standard opening moves should leave most players with the option to do [i]something[/i] later on. Just don't be surprised if the fast thinker will also spot the correct blocking move first.

I do feel that the game is let down by the one thing that makes it stand apart from just about all other "semi-serious" abstract games, its real time nature. It does make it a great and quick-playing filler, slightly chaotic, and fun on the first few outings. But it won't be long before players know exactly how the odds for victory are stacked, the same way that Ricochet Robot is also always won by the usual suspects. It is not the type of game that will see many instant replays for long, and games in which all players are closely matched are rare. I don't enjoy games if I know that the same people are made to feel that they are just there to fill up the numbers and create a bit of unpredictable variety in the opening moves.

Which is a shame, as the underlying stacking mechanisms are neat, but get covered up by an overbearing speed element before early strategic placement decisions really get to shine. As long as you play with people who know that a reasonable playing speed is needed to keep fun on the table, this game has far more to offer as a bog-standard turn-based exercise. Maybe not as eye-catching at conventions, but one that will be replayed long after the stand-holders have left town, whereas the presented game quickly loses its appeal. In our house, anyway.

I am surprised that the turn-based option wasn't offered as an obvious alternative playing style, considering this game was presented as a stand-alone in the Icehouse range, and durability then becomes an important factor.

The two player variant, in which 2 players play two colours, but decide in secret which of the two is the scoring one, is a neat solution to an obvious problem.

I guess this is the bit where you point out that anyone who owns this set, can use it to play a wide variety of other freely available games, and that you are only one easily compiled marker set short of the pinnacle of pyramid gaming: Zendo. The truth is, the same can be said after buying a family pack of coloured M&M's. It doesn't make IceTowers, the game, any better, and in its current form, its main function will indeed be, to provide pieces for other games. Which makes me wonder what made this the Looney Lab choice for a stand-alone release.

Played a few times with 3 and 4 players.  It's a pretty good filler, plays quick and is entertaining.  I've not played it enough to know if there is any strategy to it; I suspect there is some but not much.  Time to enjoyment ratio is still quite high for me.  Worth keeping.

A game without turns -- but which doesn't just devolve into grabbing pieces and trying to play as quickly as possible.  Very clever indeed.  I have no idea what the best overall strategy is -- but I'm sure there is one, and I'm sure that if I were to play an expert, I'd get hosed thoroughly.

Decent real-time game that's quick to learn and has high replay value. Playing with three of each size pyramid (instead of the usual five) makes for a shorter, but still interesting game.

IceTowers is a real-time game of set-collection using Looney Pyramids. While a single game typically takes between 10 and 15 minutes, there has never been a session where we didn't demand to play 2-3 times in a row. Our matches always run multiple rounds with the final total score deciding the winner.

This is one of the "real time" games, and as such holds a position above where it really should rank.  The real time mechanism makes experience important, and can really frustrate younger or newer players as they can never catch up to the other players.  The game is fun with IceHouse pieces, and fun to watch.

Dec08: Well, that was refreshingly different.  It was a real time game with actual decisions and choices offered to the players.  Not a "first to slap the pair" type at all.

I can see why this one doesn't get the love though.  The boxed version I have doesn't seem to have gotten a wide release.  And really, even though you can play with any IceHouse pieces, most people will just play zendo :)

Also, even though the rules are short, they are very hard to get your head around.  Once you've played it a couple times, they all makes sense (kind of).  Additionally, I think it was a mistake to include all that strategy information inside the rule book.  It just confuses new players and makes them think the game is more complicated than it is.

Anyway, about the actual game.  I had fun playing it and frequently yelled and cussed as my wife cut me off. We played with "Gus the Ghost" and that worked quite well.  The decisions were interesting, and you had to make them at a frenzied pace.  Once you understood the rules, you could implement them quickly.

So overall, I give it high on the fun ranks.  High on the interesting decisions.  And obviously very low on the downtime.  Heck, even the scoring takes just a moment to count your pips (make piles of 10).  Much quicker scoring than Light Speed.

So if you have the bits, then I recommend investing the 15 minutes it takes to understand how to play this innovative game.

After 2 plays.  Tentative rating (might go up by 1).

Real-time game, which is not intuitive at all at first.  In the second game you start to notice some strategy and tricks, but I didn't play more than that, so I had no time to explore them and make a solid judgement of the game.
If it turns out that these tricks are efficient and form some kind of general strategy *AND* prevail over chaos, my rating will improve.

This is one of my least favorite pyramid games.  I'm not sure I "get" it.  It doesn't help that my first couple of games were against somebody who's really, really good at it (Alison Frane).  And with giant pieces, which makes it somewhat akin to a sport rather than a board game.  I actually liked it a little better when I finally played it with the regular pieces.  There's hope for this game for me, but I may not give it that chance since there's a bunch of pyramid games I'd rather play.

IceTowers is an aggressively fast paced 'real-time' game of pyramid stacking for 3+ players.  The object of the game is to control as many stacked towers by 'capping' each with a pyramid of your own color.  The fun really starts when all players are 'mining' and/or 'splitting' the towers to their own advantage.  Fun, fast and great with kids.

Icetowers is a real-time simultaneous play game for 2-5 players involving stacking smaller pyramids on top of larger ones to control them. With the Icetowers set, you can play nearly any of the Icehouse games. (The color scheme of the Icetowers set -- purple, white, clear, and pale blue -- may cause some mild confusion for players reading rules that refer to red, yellow, and green pyramids.)Icetowers is an actual boxed game using Icehouse Pieces. It was sold for a while by Looney Labs but is currently discontinued.It was listed for 3-5 players earlier (e.g. in Playing With Pyramids) but now seems officially for 2-5 (e.g at http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/icetowers )

A real-time game like Icehouse, but more accessible.  "Playing with Gus" is a fun way for two players, especially with kids, who are tickled by the idea of a friendly gaming ghost named Gus.  Because the game is played real-time, players have to develop an intuitive feeling for the rules: early games tend to be rife with unnoticed illegal moves, until players have fully assimilated what is allowed in mining, etc.

Good game to play when waiting for other players to show up, or to round off the night. All but broken with 2 players, really shines at 4 players. 5 players works alright, but it's too easy to play opportunistically.

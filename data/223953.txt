excellent co-op game. It gives tension, but not anxiety. The kickstarter perks give more than enough variable game modes and variable difficulty to never feel like it is a stale game. While the board is a little drab. And the I could imagine a deluxe version that came with an insert and more art on the cards. It is an excellent game that I will never turn down.

My fiancé and I played 3-4 games of this over 2 nights and had a blast. It is the perfect co-op for us. The 4 minute rounds allow some planning/strategy at the beginning but you can't go through every available strategy ad nauseam because once the timer starts it really does feel like you are in a busy restaurant and simply don't have enough time. This really helps as someone "taking over" co-op games definitely happens in our group and I think this game mitigates that. Plenty of variety with the different objective cards (strictly making money vs worrying about prestige points alters strategy and decision making). Can't wait to continue adding expansions as we get more comfortable with the game. Overall very impressed.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this game.  This is the game that I have been wanting to design for years, and I have to say that the implementation is better than I could have imagined and the design is well thought out.

Imagine playing Overcooked on a board game (video game which I also love) and that is what Kitchen Rush is.

Big Con:  The timers are WAY off in the version we play.  I'm all for small variance (say +-10% of 30 seconds, so 27-33 seconds in range).  However, one of our times was at 18 seconds.  For a 4 minute game, that is 13.3 actions instead of 8, which can make a huge difference in what a user can do. I might consider getting different sand timers for the game if I buy the game myself.

Very tight, fast paced and frantic realtime coop that has you struggling for 4 min for 4 times, with timeouts in between. Quite a few choices here, and the presence of 2 workers per person (plus common workers available to everyone) makes for a challenging multitasking 4min play where talking with your friends before starting the clock is necessary but also thinking on your feet and cooperating with them during the clock being a necessity.All in all, if you like the real time aspect, it’s worth a try. The multiple cards about orders/objectives keeps it fresh and i assume you’ll get better at it the more you play.

Played at the UK games expo.
Played a 4 player game at Artipia's booth.
This was a LOT of fun, very frantic and goofy mayhem!. All of a sudden once we hit the groove ..arms where everywhere!, frantically attempting to collect ingredients, cook and get orders out. All the time buying more food ingredients, washing dishes, taking more orders. Wow, really , really fun game!

Highlight of the expo for our group :-)

I ordered this from the U.S. in great anticipation and at great cost. Waited, waited, waited. Finally the package arrived at my building, but... a low-life asshole who lives in the same building stole the package from under my nose. There's CCTV footage of it, and we know who he is, but the cops don't want to seem to do anything about it. Not a priority - to them, it's "just a boardgame". I'm not confronting the offender about it for fear of reprisal attacks - he's a dodgy asshole and I don't want to get on his bad side. I'm DEVASTATED, but I'll buy another copy at some point and have it sent to my office instead.

Kickstartered, picked up in Essen, first game played after Essen day 1. This is a lot of fun. We needed a couple of tries to get more than 1 order per player out. Needs some alignment between players before every round, then it is 4 minutes of mayhem. Light game, but loving this !

I'm not a fan of timed games. As soon as James started explaining the rules, I was "ugh, shades of Time 'n' Space". So many sand-timers. It was not bad. I suppose for a timed cooperative game it was good. But it was very chaotic and messy; it had a ton of bits with set-up and cleanup; and it seemed like the difficulty levels were a bit too high.
Would prefer not to play it again, but if the group really wants to, then I'll enjoy it enough.

Great game, love it!  Just as with the video game "overcooked" you finish a round reflecting on what you could have done better, and different approaches you could have taken.

I don't like the graphics - gradient vector fills or whatever they are, and strange uglinesses.  Box cover is nearly great, though.  I'm looking forward to an edition with a better look, generally.

Not as perfectly thematic as I'd have liked (e.g. anyone can look at the spice bag, whenever?  And the maitre d' can just cycle two customers out if you don't fancy preparing what they want to eat?), though in general the strong theme is definitely a big plus.

This has more legs than magic maze, though it has significantly more setup and teaching.  Less so than Space Alert, however, and I'm pretty sure the group will say "again!" right after you end the first game in failure.

On setup, each "setup for N players" case should have a nice big reference card with picture.  This would help the teacher delegate setup to the other players: "set up the board to match this picture, please", keeping them involved and speeding the phase.

Rule book is well laid out and reads well, though it doesn't help people on their first play as much as it could.

It's pretty hectic and I find it less tense in some ways because it is a cooperative game, but it is interesting to figure out how to get the right things in the right place at the right time together and I wouldn't mind playing it some more.

The game is fun. Seems like it might get old after a while. Biggest take away after playing it was unrelated to the game really. It is that every worker placement out there should use timers as players. 100% prevention of AP.

This game is pure fun. It's hard and stressful but the theme really shines through and it really seems like a game that you can really get better at. I like the mix of a rather simple but still strategic worker placement game with the stress of real time. The small detail that you need someone else to buy ingredients if you realise that the storage doesn't have what you need after you get there is brilliant and adds so much cooperative flavour.

This game is super cool in concept and I honestly did enjoy playing it. It just seems kind of impossible to accomplish the goals (specifically in regard to money since it is so hard to earn). Played at 3, but doesn't seem like player count would affect things too much. Open to tips for improvement. Really want to like this more.
Update: Played a 2-player game and it went so much better. This game has the love I wanted to give it now.

Should be called Kitchen Utter Freakout - It's more than a rush -- it's a mad panic.

An absolute load of chaotic kitchen fun as you work cooperatively to run a restaurant. It's hilarious how appallingly awry the carefully talked-out pre-service plans go about 30 seconds into the four minute round.

Would be great at parties.

I enjoy real-time co-op games with a frantic feel and this one has easily taken the throne as my favourite rising above both Escape: Curse of the Temple and Magic Maze.
I love the idea of workers with a timer and here it works so well. Additionally, I felt that the game gave a very good representation of what it can be like in a busy kitchen: stressful. But I would say in a good way. It's just difficult to keep an eye on everything.
I am super pleased I have played this one.

First Impressions: Really liked my first time playing it. We failed horribly, but we all had fun while doing so. It's pretty hectic, but not so screamy hectic as Escape from the Cursed Temple can be.

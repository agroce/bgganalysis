This is a very clever little trick taking game -- one of the most creative I have seen in a while.

The rules for a round are determined by the players, and some of the rules are really out there.  For example, one might have you passing all winning tricks to the player on your left.  Or, you score big points for winning zero tricks, etc.    What it means is that every hand can be played in many different ways depending on what rule you choose to play.

Now there's not a whole lot of control since all players input to the "rules", but it's a fun game. 

Initial rating an 8.

Chaotic, but the chaos happens before you play tricks. That means seemingly good hands become bad hands. But there's a ton of variety here.

RATING: 8
A very awesome trick-taking game, where each player gets to determine a rule that is in effect for the hand after checking out their hand at the beginning of each round.  The card combos can be totally wacky and rather chaotic, but in a very controlled manner, since you get partial input on the rules.

In the end, you get a semi-unpredictable set of rules where everyone groans when they see the rules everyone else put in, often screwing up the rules everyone else had hoped for!  Then, you play out the hand, trying to do your best to cope with the rules in play.

This all sounds very chaotic, but in the end, everyone is just trying to do the best they can with what they've got, which is what I love in a trick taking game.  Plus, you get the feeling that every hand is different due to the changing rules, which is just plain sweet.

Not as fun as cosmic eidex, but few things are.  This game puts the players in the position of determining how to play each hand based on rules that change before play begins each hand.  Players have some small input in how those rules change, too.  This can lead to unusual situations with rule vagaries, and can completely throw the scoring out of whack.  But even those things can be fun taken in the right spirit.

Fluxx: The Trick-Taking Game. Okay, that might be slightly unfair but it's not far off the mark. Maybe closer to a cross between Fluxx and Was sticht? The game is a fairly traditional trick-taker at heart but each hand players select rule cards from their hands that will alter the rules (be it trump, points scored, or passing cards to your neighbours) for this round.

As the rules selection happens secretly and simultaneously it gives the game a very chaotic feel, turning an interesting idea into a random luckfest that only allows for tactical play during a round. Good for a goofy laugh or two but very much unsuited for your serious trick-taking fix.

I'm a fan of wacky, mind-bending trick-taking games like Cosmic Eidex and Was Sticht. So I was immediately intrigued by the concept underpinning Stich-Meister. Unfortunately, the game's not much fun.

The main problem is the flat and unexciting scoring. One point per trick just doesn't produce enough tension, and the rule cards that modify the scoring aren't much help in this regard.

Another problem is that you just don't see very many creative and fun rule combos. This is because only 19 of the 60 rule cards change the basic gameplay; the others dictate trumps or scoring. So you typically only have one of these gameplay-altering cards in play each round.

Friese does a trick-taking construction kit. Each round, four rules are chosen by the players that modify the basic trick-taking game. These rules can be basic modifications, trump rules and/or scoring rules. Rounds can be pretty close to the classic rules or highly chaotic. Accordingly, enjoyment of playing out each single round will vary.

The player-chosen rules maintain the novelty factor which is the main attraction as the underlying trick-taking game itself is only of average interest.

A chaotic take on trick taking in which it's really hard for you to plan in advance based on your cards as the rules played by the players mix everything up quite thoroughly. Generates laughter and disbelief, but I don't think the idea could carry the game in the long run and hc trick takers probably aren't that pleased with this.

Not the first "players decide the rules" trick taking game I've played, but by far the best. The staggering amount of rule variations makes the game fun and some of the combinations can be quite mind bending even for players who think they've seen every trick taking rule variation ever invented.

Stich Meister and Cosmic Eidex are probably the only trick taking games anybody needs to own.

LIKE:

* Enjoyable filler that plays with traditional trick taking rules except for the rules players select to put in place for each round.
* Different rules make each round unique and interesting - but may detract from actual ability to plan ahead well.

DISLIKE:

* Not sure if it really bothered me, but I doubt there is much opportunity for careful planning.  This game is really all about tactical play of cards and hoping the other players don't choose rules that will mess with your best laid plans (and good luck with that! ;-) )

2nd best game of 2010.
I think Stich-Meister is the ultimate trick-taking game that makes pretty much all other trick-taking games unnecessary (except Haggis, for 2p, and Tichu, for partnership trick-taking). The games can vary wildly from serious to silly depending on the rule combinations, but it's always interesting - two games are never the same! 

2-Player Comment:
*Doesn't work for two. Haggis is a great game in this genre that's designed for two.

I like tricktaking games and this one is no exception. A touch of unpredictability in terms of what the rules for the round will be. The round start with each player choosing one of his three rule cards. The rule cards played together make up the rules for the round. It provides for fun surprises. When rule cards are opened up, you have to adapt your game play to the new rules. Very enjoyable.

A trick-taking game where every round has slightly different rules. Players have hand of 3 rules cards and for every round you may play one of them to help (or eventually mess up) your game. The core game is pretty basic trick-taking where you gain 1 point/trick. Rules can affect trump suit (actually without rules card there is none), scoring or general way game is being played. 

This can create very weird/fun rounds or sometimes a bit dull rounds. The game is more on the chaotic side as you cannot know really what rules there might be coming. Fun every now and then but many more trick-taking games are better for serious gaming.

Seems to work equally well (or not) on five and four players.

First time I played the game, it seemed like I hadn't felt so much hate against a game for a long time. As a trick taking fanatic, I strongly disliked not being able to evaluate my hand BEFORE the decision which rule card I should play. Now, I have to revise my judgement. Obviously, I had been in a bad mood or something, but the game is actually demanding and enjoyable when you realize that the mentioned decision doesn't really matter. The real challenge is to adapt your play to the rules. That is also tough and fun.

With 4 new different mini-rules applied every hand, every hand is like a mini-game in itself. Each player chooses a rule from a hand of 3, and they'll either be a change to how this hand is scored (eg +ve cards, -ve cards, etc), changes to the basic trick taking rules (eg 1's are now highest) or setting trumps (ie which numbers and/or suits). So hands can be straight-forward or wacky, but probably rarely what exactly suits your hand. So go with the flow, accept the chaos, score what you will and enjoy it because it'll be fun when played in that vein. But it's probably for trick-taking lovers only given the swings in fortune from hand to hand, and will probably drive anyone looking for a serious game around the bend.

A fun trick-taker in which the rules change each hand. I knew what kind of a game it was from the rule-reveal in the first hand. With almost no brown cards, I tossed in 'every brown card you take is minus 1 point' and was delighted to see someone else had picked brown as trump... until I read the final rule card: 'for this round, negative points become positive and vice versa'.

Jan. 2011: My only game was a six player game, even though it's listed for 3-5 players. It really should not be played with this many players.

Honestly, there is way too much chaos to take this game seriously. It's the Magical Athlete of trick taking games: the joy in this game comes from the unexpected and unpredictable rule combinations that emerge in each hand -- not the thrill of making any strategic plans (since it's next to impossible).

I really would like to try this at 3 to see if the the chaos factor would be significantly reduced. However, I don't foresee that this game will be as intriguing and challenging as Cosmic Eidex or Chronicle, both of which feature lots and lots of special powers.

Nasty trick taking game with a twist that the rules are generated again before each round using special rule cards played by players. So there is a little idea about the possible rules for the round, but in the end it is more or less random. I really like this kind of games and would like to play this more.

"This color is the trump, but the trump is the lowest color this round and also the trump (and one other color) cards give negative points."

Oh, you like trick-taking games?  And Stich-Meister has gotten your attention?  Well, beware, because this game also has some characteristics of everyone's least-favorite chaotic game, Fluxx.  See, at the start of each hand, players get to pick the rules that will apply for that hand, and what you picked may not interact well with what other players pick.  You might think that you can pick your rule after seeing what other players pick, but you would be wrong!  It's all pitched into the middle of the table at the same time, and they're revealed simultaneously.  There's some fun to be had here, but everyone needs to know in advance that this is going to be a chaotic game from the start.

I like most trick taking games and this is no exception. However, sometimes the swings can be really huge and there is not much you can do when you have horrible cards for a specific rounds. One should definitely play many rounds to average this randomness away. I like the way the rules mechanic works and sometimes the rules are just super crazy. Enjoyable, but maybe not for too serious gaming.

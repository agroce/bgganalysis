Glad to see the series is strong as ever! Not quite as fun as Tortoise and Hare but still very interesting as you try to figure out your opponents thinking. Love that it plays 2 different ways so it works for everyone

RATING: 7
For a kids game this works, played against another adult with it and it was okay, the trying to out think your opponent would be harder with a kid who doesn't always pick the best move, unlike with adults who can see the strategy and make better guesses.  I skipped straight to expert mode and worked well and it still played fast but I don't think it's a game for adults but more of a family game with non-gamers and kids.

The simple game is not a bad children game, the complex one takes itself too seriously. Fiddly and not that much fun.

Restons dans le thème nature mais passons sur les fables de La Fontaine. Yohan Levet, l'auteur, est une fourmi. Ou il a vécu dans une fourmilière, son premier jeu étant le fameux Myrmes, où on gérait son exploitation de fourmis. Ce jeu n'est pas un jeu pour les enfants mais pour jouer avec les enfants (subtile nuance), où il va falloir récupérer des provisions pour l'hiver. Je ne l'ai pas encore essayé, mais il paraît que c'est fourmidable.

RATING: 5
A bluffing game where the roles of ant and grasshopper pass around the table.  On a given round, the ant lays a trail of six pieces over a 4x4 grid of cards, then secretly chooses a terrain type to score.  The grasshopper tries to guess which type the ant chose.  If the grasshopper is correct, they get the points (and the ant stays ant), otherwise the ant does.  Points are tallied on a simple score track, and cards with insects are kept for hidden points at the end.

Simple game that works, but after wonderful bluffing games such as Skull, Coup, Cockroach Poker, and so on, this is definitely lower shelf stuff.

This is like an intro to bluffing game for kids and it works just fine.  There are two versions in the game, making for a nice level of replay value.  This works best with families but you could also break it out with a game group (though not likely).  Nice components too, I'd say this is #3 in the Tales and Games Series.

Czwarta część Bajkogier. Pasikonink i mrówka. Ciekawy pomysł, może być fajna dla dziecka, tylko trochę za droga jak na tę ilość komponentów. Zresztą w każdej płaci się za opakowanie i pomysł nie za komponenty w pudełku. Z drugiej strony jest i-szop i upusty w 3trolach więc da się kupić w rozsądnej cenie.

This game and Forbidden Dessert are terrible, and here's why:

Neither one has a rules book to speak of.  All the rules contain is a description of the bits, plus info about a few possible moves.  And occasionally they'll give you a slight hint as to how to keep score, and how to win.  But that's all!

(I guess I should mention that at least their illustrations are good quality. But how does that help?)

Let me try to find a few examples for you:

""She can ask for aid from her comrades."  OK, nowhere  are there any comrades. Plus this isn't a cooperative game anyway.

"The player when the player collects a PATH card..." "Path cards without insects are collected normally..." Okay, but you haven't mentioned collecting path cards, and it isn't mentioned later either.

"You acquire PATH cards..." Okay, and then what do you do wit them?

And from Forbidden Desert:

"Match up 2 cards to find the treasure." But the cards don't have any similarities, so how do you know which cards match?

""The launch pad is important." That's nice, but how is it important?  It's not mentioned anywhere in the manual.

"Tunnels provide shelter from the sun."  That's nice, but what do we do about it? I should acknowledge that dying from thirst loses the game, but where do we do anything about it?

And this one is a little difficult to describe.  Moving is described.  But nothing about how to move, or where to move, or why.  There's nothing like "Play 2 cards and move two spaces to the right" or "If someone takes your pawn, move an adjacent pawn into that space."

"You excavate for equipment.  Okay, and then what do or not do with it? It's not mentioned again after this section.

"Turn a piece over to mark it blocked." What do we do once it's blocked? Bocking is not mentioned again.

There is lots more, of course, but this should give you the flavor of these non-games.  Or, really non-rulebooks. I'm sure there's a game in there somewhere trying to get out.

I must say something nice, so I''ll mention that it's a cute idea the have the thirstiest player go first.

Summary: Do not buy. Or rather do not try to play, be cause you won't be able to. Thumbs down, negative 1 stars.

I'm trying to find out how to tell the designer about this. Wish me luck.

Comments welcome!

This is a nice bluffing game in Autumn mode, and a race in Winter mode. Not as nice as Hare & Tortoise but easily 2nd best in the series.

This may be my favorite game of the series. It's certainly the best with 2 players. The components are again quite impressive, as is the general production. The mechanics probably are abstracted from the theme more in this game than in Three Little Pigs or Hare and the Tortoise. To be fair, it's a fairly hard theme to make sense of in a game. Nevertheless, my wife and I enjoyed how quick and light it is. Most importantly, it's fun!

Betting

The more I play, the more I like this simple betting/guessing game. Basically one player secretly chooses one of four tiles, and the other players try to guess which one.  There is more to it than that, but that's the general idea.

And this was another surprise form Tales and Games...

They make this series of games based on Fairy Tales for kids, but they usually include some sort of advanced rules in them too to make them interesting to adults also...

And this one is pretty cool... We played the "Winter" version of the game, I think that's the name, the advanced version and in it one player is the Ant, another the Grasshopper and the rest are whatever you want  I don't remember if they had a specific name...

The ant makes a path in the tiles that form the board and those tiles are surfaces, like wood, floor, table cloth and another one... they can also have insects in them...

The ant marks that path with 6 ant meeples and then selects one of the surface type that the meeples he placed are on... 

The Grasshopper and the other players try to deduce what surface the Ant picked... If the Grasshopper is right he gets all the Surface Tiles that match that one where there are ants on... and no one else gets nothing...

If the Grasshopper is wrong, the Ant gets all those tiles and the other players that guessed right get one Random Tile from the tile deck...

These tiles are the currency to trade for objectives that we want to pick up and that require specif types of surfaces to reach... Each one is worth 1 Point, if you get 2 objectives of the same type they are worth 3 points, and the first player to 4 points wins...

You can only claim those objectives when you get the tiles either has the Ant or the Grasshopper... so you can see what a player has, what objectives are on the display and what he might be going for and you try to get inside his head and deduce what he's going for...

But that would be too easy for everyone to guess what the Ant wants... The twist is that some tiles have insects and when that happens instead of picking up the tile you can exchange that tile for another one that's on the board that has the same insect! and here is where the second guessing comes in... is he going for the obvious and easy to deduce tile? is he seeing that he can get the tile he needs by picking that surface that has the same insect has the one he needs? is he going to stall and go for a completely different surface?

And there's also another cool twist to this, if you pick a tile that has an insect, you can discard it and receive a card that has the same insect that gives you a special power, be it a +1 Point, being able to use 2 of the same surface as a different surface to claim an objective, being able to trade one of your claimed objectives with one from another player, etc...

The game is pretty darn cool!!

Another hit in the Tales and Games series, this one is a bluffing game that requires a bit of thought that I really enjoy playing with the kids (6 and 4).  As always, impeccable presentation and components.  I like seeing all four games in the series lined up next to each other in the shelf.

The inclusion of the fairy tale is a nice addition, but much like the one in The Tortoise and the Hare, I'm not sure who these are geared towards.  Multiple versions of the same tale - the Aesop version is extremely short - and the two other poem versions are just plain odd.  And I'm an English major.

I was hoping for the inclusion of a bonus card or tile for an earlier game in the series - much like Baba Yaga did for Three Little Pigs.  It was a nice touch that hasn't been repeated since.  Oh well.

Great components and art, and a neat little bluffing game.

Rating 7 is for the Winter scenario. The Autumn scenario is just a bit too quick and light for my tastes, though I'm sure it's fine for kids.

Outguessing your opponents, a mechanism I personally like. And this game uses it in a good way (with nice material).

A bit of a simple game, with basic bluffing. The two variants included should help sell this to kids and gamers alike. Not bad but not the best on the series.

Even the basic game is bit complicated for younger kids, but that doesn't make it unenjoyable, just easy to get confused. A good reading-your-opponent starter game. Hardest part if you play the different versions is remembering the rules changes between each.

1 play, 3er

This is the lightest of the series (of 4 so far), at least of the 3 I've played. And unfortunately, the basic game is not up to par -- the first two were much better. It's a guessing game, mixed with a some set-collection. There's a grid of tiles of 4 types. The ant player creates a contiguous path using 6 ant tokens. The other 2 players (a grasshopper, and a fire ant) try to guess which type of tile the ant player chose. If the grasshopper guesses correctly, he scores; otherwise, if the fire ant is right he scores; otherwise, the black ant scores. To score, count all tiles of the type chosen; advance that many spaces in the score track (max 4 spaces). The red ant draws off the top of the tile deck instead. Also save the tiles with bugs pictured. Then, refill the grid, and the roles rotate and you go again.

The game ends when any player gets two markers to the end of the score track. Score VP for each tile type (1/3/6/10 for advancing 1/2/3/4 spaces). Earn bonus VP for each type of bug collected, too (same progression). Most VP wins!

Very light, random, quick game. The advanced version is likely better? According to [user=Flightsurg], it is: " Advanced much better, suitable for adults. Doesn't use the score track at all. Instead, as you claim and accumulate tiles, they are used as "currency" to purchase victory point cards. Also, the bugs on the tiles take on special meaning, with each granting a special power." So I'll reserve rating this until trying that.

Basic game: 5/10
Advanced game: ?

RATING: 8
Better than the original since you can rotate the piece that shoots the laser.  The lasers are a gimmick though and totally unnecessary for gameplay.  I don't even bother to fire the laser any more and just mentally trace where the laser will go (which you are doing anyway as you are planning your move).

I’m not a big fan of most abstract games, even though I LOVE some of them. But, generally, I don’t fancy chess-like games, and this one sort of feels like chess. Admittedly, it’s faster and in my opinion a lot cooler with the lasers and mirrors, but it’s still not something I’m eager to play. Can be convinced to play again, but it’s not something I would seek out.

COMPARISON TO 1.0: 

I think I prefer the Anubises to the obelisks, but the new lasers make it harder to force your opponent into killing one of their own pieces.

Certainly, I prefer the larger board and side-rails of the original.  The packaging is a pain in the ass though, which I believe they rectified for 2.0.  It's a toss up; they're not different enough to recommend one aver the other.  Buy whichever version is cheaper.

I was first exposed to this game a few years prior to acquiring it at a friend's house.  They had just gotten it for Christmas and had boasted about never having lost a game yet.  I took it as a challenge and beat him after only about 5 moves!  It was great!

I would much rather play this game than chess any day.  The mirrors really add a nice twist in manipulating the laser beam.

I used to study chess in my younger days and played it quite well (can't remember my ranking, though, but it wasn't anything spectacular).  Perhaps it was the constant exposure to the game from the very first time someone taught it to me (I want to say I learned in grade 2 or 3.... but that was so long ago) that allowed me to do well with it, or rather, at least allowed me to play it proficiently; see, developing any modicum of skill with chess means thinking spatially and learning how to force your opponent to move in very specific ways.  Even to this day, thinking of strategies in chess comes by very naturally for me.

With Khet, however, my mind blows up.  I don't want to suggest that Khet is any more complicated or simpler than standard chess, but rather that it takes a very different kind of thinking even though the 'feel' of Khet is very similar to its ancient forebear.  Since every piece moves exactly the same and the only real difference between them is which sides are vulnerable and which sides are mirrors, you're not just thinking in terms of capture and value (hell if I know if value is even a concept in Khet).  You don't directly remove pieces by landing on them, oh, no.  You have to shoot 'em with a laser and oh, yeah, that laser is stationary!  Enter the mirrors, angled at 45-degrees - position them carefully and the laser will start making 90-degree turns all over the board, and the end goal is to hit your opponent's Pharoah.

For that reason alone, Khet is incredibly fascinating to play and can twist your brain in all kinds of directions.  Yes, being an 80s kid means that I was subject to the fascination of lasers - particularly the kind that drew awful pictures on the ceiling while 'rock' music blasted into my ears at the planetarium - but the draw of Khet isn't so much the technology, but rather in its use.  You could accomplish the exact same thing with a piece of string and some pins if you wanted to really cheapen the effect, but the strategy would remain incredibly sound.  The point is that you don't get this game simply because it has a novelty laser in it (okay, some of you do), but rather it's used so well and so simply that the game feels like it [I]just so happens[/I] to have lasers in it.

But really, if you need a reason to play this, well, Khet has lasers in it.

I own the first Khet & expansions.

I like being able to rotate the laser to either shoot the beam down the furtherest right vertical column or the bottom horizontal row.  The rules for the new piece Anubis are interesting.  Gone are the stacking Obelisks.

Unfortunately, also gone are the side rails, which shows where the laser hits when it doesn't hit a piece. I played today with someone who had trouble figuring out how the light would deflect--they were constantly looking for the light by running their hand along each side, looking for the where the light exits. This is fiddly and takes more time, because I think you need to always show where the light goes as a check to prove you haven't missed a hit.  With the black rails the results were confirmed immediately, and hunting was eliminated.

The game is more compact than the first Khet and takes a lot less shelf space. 

I haven't decided if I will keep both versions.  I don't think I need both, but Khet 2 is evidently not going to have the tower expansion which I think is nifty, and it lacks those important perimeter side rails.  It plays differently and I like the new Anubis.  So, if I keep only one, which one?

Used to be called Laser Chess. I'm sure purists want to scream, but this two player gem caters to the same likes and strategies as chess. This version allows players to rotate their respective lasers 90 degrees as an optional move, acting as a multiplier for dimension. Easy to learn, hard to master. If you like chess, you will likely find this entertaining. If you hate chess, you will likely hate this game too. If you absolutely LOVE chess, you probably don't play any other games anyway.

RATING: 7
An interesting 2 player game that has the simplicity of Checkers and a gimmick that is an actual game mechanic instead of a marketing tool.

Rules are very straightforward that both gamers and non-gamers can enjoy.  You simply have two options: Move a piece in any of the 8 directions, or rotate a piece 90 degrees.  Afterwards, fire the laser.  Wherever the laser hits, it's destroyed (including your own).  The game's objective is to destroy the enemy's sphinx.

I'm shocked that this is a game that has no mass market appeal.  The original Khet has been around for over a decade and even though the game is simple with an interesting premise, I don't see it stocked at big box stores like Target or Wal-Mart.

This is unfortunate because I find the game to be a fascinating casual strategy game like Abalone and Gobblet, but with a bit more meat.

My main complaints about the game is it can lead to some serious downtime towards the end of the game where pieces become scarce.  The other issue is there are obvious opening moves in the game, making the first few minutes feel like a chore.

There is a beam splitter expansion.  I highly recommend NOT getting it.

This is a really interesting game. I like that the setup is variable. It's easy to learn, but there seems to be a lot of depth to it. It's kind of gimicky, but the gameplay is still solid. That's what counts. 

That said, the AI of the PC version is atrocious. Even at the strongest setting it is absurdly awful at the game. Given that I learned the game by playing against it (Michelle won't even try it), this is pretty pathetic. I'm even afraid to give the android/PC version of Hive a try, because it's by the same developers.

I don't know if this is a problem with decent players, but it's not difficult on the standard layout (and to a lesser degree the Imhotep one as well) to set up a fairly robust defensive position. The mirror on the bottom left is moved in front of the left anubis, and that anubis is turned left. Move any mirror in front of the sphinx, and now only the right side of the back row is vulverable (annoying to get to). Of course, this doesn't work if you run out of pieces, but that could take forever.

[thing=91034][/thing] is a pretty unique game: because it uses lasers and its refraction in mirrors in order to create its gameplay. The idea is use pieces composed by angled mirrors to lead the beam of laser in order to hit the Pharaoh of the opponent, while, at the same time, preventing this fate to happen with yours. 

Pieces that are hit by the laser in any part that isn't the mirror (expect the Anubis pieces, that don't have mirrors and are only removed if hit on the sides, not in the front, and the Sphinx pieces), are removed, even if the beam comes from the owner of the piece. Normally the pieces have one mirror in a 45º angle, and are opaque on the other side, where they can be hit and eliminated.

The winner will be the person that hits the Pharaoh of the other person with laser.

[thing=91034][/thing] is exactly the type of game that slaps me in face: one of my weakness are games that require spatial awareness, such as Ubongo, and with [thing=91034][/thing] wasn't different, as I suffered dearly trying to cope with the positioning of the pieces close to a minimally efficient way. Usually, since I didn't want to take too long to make a move, I would lost track to where my beam would go, and, worst, what were the options my opponent would have, which windows I should close, and leaving opportunities for they to explore. My first games were ridiculous, almost shameful, but I did got a little better, at least to the point of actually giving some challenge to my adversaries.

And this happened because [thing=91034][/thing] is a game with simple rules: the movement of pieces isn't complicated, and the laser, always refracted in a 45º, allows, with some attention, to calculate where it will go.

[thing=91034][/thing] is definitely a good game to teach and exercise the spatial muscles, demanding forward planning, preparation and responses to the opponent's moves. There is no luck in the game, but, luckly, the learning curve isn't too steep, thus, after a few plays, the overall quality will became more balanced - and this is easier to achieve since games last around 20-30 minutes.

The manual comes with several types of possible set ups for the board, which is good, as I notice that, after a chunk of plays with the same formation, some optimal moves start to arise, making at least the start of the match more repetitive, though the second half is player driven, and even same starts can lead to different conclusions.

[thing=91034][/thing] isn't, normally, the type of game that, in a personal level, pleases me, due to my lack of fine-tuned spatial intelligence and since is 2 players only, yet it is so unique that I'm compelled to know it deeper. I recommend that you at least try it for the novelty.

very fun game to play. building new York in the way you can envision it! good buying mechanics and a good game strategy wise. you can move tiles and place them (ala Carcassonne). excellent game theme and not to heavy on the brain if your not into heavy thinking games. highly recommended.

Fun sort of gateway game. Don't care that it's a poor retheme of Alhambra; it works fine. I like the balancing act of paying exact for bonus turns but also not wanting to spend your entire time trying to draw money.

RATING: 1
Identical to Alhambra (which I gave a 2). Given the retheming and reprint there were some very very easy things they could have fixed (such as colors of money vs buildings matching but having no relationship). But they didn't.

The changes they made to the game made an already bad game even worse. If you want to buy expansions you can't. The "roads" instead of "walls" makes things harder to see. Artwork was worsened. Just a really bad job overall. 

It was a freebie at BGGCon which is the only reason I have it. Had I known it was just a worse version of Alhambra I would have taken the Shogun expansion (even though I don't even have the base game).

RATING: 4.5
Alhambra without any expansions is actually pretty boring and WAY too luck-heavy, especially with more than two players. The theme and artwork are cool, though. Too bad there's no Big Box for this.

RATING: 7
This game is a joy to introduce to new gamers. It requires some light strategy when planning your city and has a very rewarding mechanic for paying exact change for buildings. What keeps this version from being a monumental success is its theme. The New York theme is certainly pasted on and the box cover is pretty dry. All in all, though, a game I would gladly play any night!

Purchased at favorite local game store 11/18/12.  This is a very fun, easy game to learn and play.  It's full of interesting choices to make, and it's a great 2-player game that my wife and I love to play.  It's a great game when you have an hour to fill between the heavier games, or as a light but challenging game to either start or end your gaming session.  

Having said all that, I was highly pissed to find out that this was nothing more than Alhambra with a New York setting.  It's not Alhambra "re-themed;" it's "Alhambra goes to New York!"  It's still a great game, but I was NOT happy to find out I'd bought nothing more than a second copy of Alhambra!  That's a warning they should put on the box!!

A repackaging that was as unnecessary as it was botched.  Seriously, tiny numbers on the tiles and one space for reserve tiles?  My copy came via the generosity of an attendee of BGG.CON who had an extra copy.

Its the same game play as Alhambra, but I give it 1 rating point less due to theme and tile/board design issues.  There are many other BGGers who feel the same as I do.  However, it is in my collection, and Alhambra isn't, simply because I got New York in trade really cheap.

Great comment from user Gamemaster:

New York is basically the Anniversary (or Gold) edition of Alhambra. Since that version of Alhambra is out of print, New York is a fine substitute assuming that you don't own or care about the expansions of Alhambra.

I have both New York and Big Box of Alhambra. Whenever my group feels like vanilla Alhambra, I will pull out New York instead of the Big Box. New York is also a great size to travel to another house more easily.

Having said all of that, I would not purchase New York if you already own Alhambra. I received New York for free as part of the Big Box Alhambra Kickstarter.

From a game play and mechanisms standpoint, Alhambra is a good tile-laying and card management game.  The New York re-theme of it seems to be more intuitive and approachable to new players and family/casual gamers.  In addition, there are no expansions available for the New York version and that was a big bonus for me to get this over the original Alhamabra.  If only played from time to time, I don't think that the game needs any expansions and not having any available eliminates the temptation.  I do wish that more time and attention was put into the production of the New York-themed version.  The game board is nice, but ridiculously over-sized and doesn't contain a discard location for the money cards even though it has a spot for the draw pile. I like the names of the tiles, but a really easy thematic change for the money cards would be to label them after the boroughs of NYC rather than just NY North, South, East, West.  Sometimes it's the little things...

Picked this up at a local pickup geek auction. I haven't played the original.  I played it with the kids.  They caught on to it right away and really enjoyed building their city.  We haven't played much tile laying - just Quarantine (building their hospital).  It felt a lot like ticket to ride with majorities, not set collection/route making.

It gets Alhambra's 8 for game play.  Some mechanical changes that are great (central board, color-coded central tiles) and some that are poor (streets hard to see, money differentiated only by color, &c.) but still a great game.  Now I just need the diamond money with same back...

The more I play it, the less I like the art implementation.  Why are tiles not more distinct in color-coding?  Why are streets so hard to see?  Why are there not unique symbols for money for the color-impaired?  Boo.

New York, which has the same game play as Dirk Henn’s Spiel des Jahres-winning Alhambra, but with the Spanish architecture being replaced by the skyscrapers of Manhattan. As in the original game, players collect four types of currencies and use those funds to purchase tiles that they assemble into their own mini-metropolis, connecting the paved street edges on the tiles to create a coherent network of roads. The building tiles come in six colors, and players score for their holdings three times during the game, earning points for having the most of a color as well as for their longest road.

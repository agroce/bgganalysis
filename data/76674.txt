+ Definitely an eye-catching game when you get it on the table; solving the puzzle of your turn, figuring out how to maximize your string placement (and your actions, when playing the Transport version), is engaging and fun.
- For its weight, feels like it should take less time to play than it actually does.

It's fast playing and neat for the time it takes. But it can also be a little annoying with how "clear" the proper rules for laying string can be. That's sort of the intent (light fun). But it's also annoying. Players naturally bend the rules, which can break the actual game side of it.

Fun little filler game with what I think is a decently heft dose of strategy that didn't come out on its first play.

I think if this were played repeatedly, we could get some deep strategies going. Simple enough for the kids to learn, deep enough to be enjoyable by the adults.

I mean, not something I'd beg to drag out at every opportunity, but *pretty good*.

I don't really see the point in this game.  It seems to lack any real strategic decisions.  You just draw a tile, hope to randomly get a good station, and then try to set it down so you can trace a path to it with a piece of string.  The game had no fun factor, and with the thickness of the string, it gave way to a lot of confusing situations.  Knowing what was legal was tough.  I'm not sure what people see in this game.  I could have just as much fun tying my shoelaces.  There are almost no decisions in the game, and it all seems to come down to who draws the best stations.  If it's going to be pure luck, I'll take LCR over this because that is less work.  Big time bust!

This is a strange one - it's not bad, but it fell flat for me. I bought it to play as a short game with friends and family, but the rules always seemed just a little too complicated to explain relative to what the game ought to be - lighthearted and even silly. Math traded for Mamma Mia! - maybe that will be the game I'm looking for.

I just don't get the appeal of this game. Where's the strategy? Half the time, you are just drawing worthless stations and trying to find a space for them on the table where they will be out of your way. You are given so few train lines that you have very little to do with them. The "dexterity" element seems to be to try to make stations inconveniently accessible to your opponents, which is mildly amusing at best, tedious and annoying at worst. And let's face it: the game just looks stupid on the table. 

Now that we have strings and paperclips, I can't wait for the edible game: "Spaghetti Railways." Or how about a game that only uses items found in your trash can?

Draw and place a tile, and then place a string "railway" in order to connect your railway to as many tiles as possible while blocking others from doing the same.  Do this for 4 turns and you have String Railways!

Overall, I thought it was a cute gimmick, but it was nothing I thought was incredibly fun or interesting.

The first thing you need to know about SR is that you can't get hung up on exactitudes. The game is not robust. Strings and tiles will move during play and you just have to let it go.

If you can get past that though, you will be treated to an interesting game that is... different. I'm not sure if there is much to the game (there might be a bit as you certainly have incentives to try and keep people away from your home base at the very least) or if it's just about having fun laying out string, but either way, I had fun doing it.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Nice filler! The physicality is neat beyond the novelty factor (which is enormous, in a good way) and actually impacts the way you play. Pretty cool.

There's really only one decision you ever make but it's always an interesting one, which works just fine due to the length of the game.

Only negative I'd say is the first couple turns are a lot less interesting than the last few.

The cleverness here didn't actually translate into as good a game as I was hoping for. Perhaps my one playing was an outlier. But what I took away was that this is a gimmick, and a game much lighter than I had hoped. 

I'd be happy to play again, and wouldn't mind getting a copy. But I think its better thought of as a quick filler, rather than played as a serious game. There is way too much luck from the draw deck to take this game very seriously (which is fine, but a bit different category of game to me).

RATING: 8
String Railway is a creative new filler that should, hopefully, bring some deserved respect to Japon Brand.

A simple, engaging game where strings are used to represent the board, a river, a mountain, and the rails that players are constructing. Each turn players draw a card representing a location on the board and use a string to connect up to as many locales as possible. Some locations offer direct screwage potential, as they score positive points when you first arrive, but result in negatives if your opponents get there.

The game is short, sweet, and has no set-up time. Pretty much the ideal filler. The only real problem is that it needs to be reprinted locally, as it's nigh impossible to find right now. Gold star award for creativity here, and easily one of my favourite fillers.

11 Jan 2011 - Since this game is very hard to find, I made a prototype using the information found in the rules and posts here. It took me about two hours in Visio and a similar amount of time cutting the laminated cardstock and yarn.

4-3-2011 8.5>8.7 In 2p, this actually becomes an involved game of calculation, as you try to keep one of your opponent's players down. A fascinating game that actually requires you to think spatially in a new way, accompanied by the typical elements of basic arithmetic, looking a move or two ahead and a sprinkling of luck.

A fun game that I could probably enjoy over and over.

Unique experience. Rules aren't clear cut (in terms of station-touching and accidental string-shifting) but in a light-hearted game this doesn't really matter.

There's definitely some strategy to explore here and it's almost the perfect filler!

Build railway stations and connect them by means of strings of wool. Depending on the type of station a number of strings can cross, and points are scored or lost. And make sure your strings don't cross any other strings in places where this is not allowed !! Knitters' fun for everyone !

Players expand their network of railway track, trying to earn the most victory points over five turns.  Players on their turn reveal a "station" card, which represents a station along with victory points earned for connecting to it, along with restrictions on how many companies can connect to it.  The station is laid inside the playing area, which is defined by a couple of metres of string!  The player then proceeds to lay one of their five pieces of string out inside the area, which represents their track, trying to arrange it in such a way as to connect to stations while avoiding crossings (other player track, the river or the mountain - all string).  A totally odd, organic feeling game, that is incredibly simple, clever, and original.  Thankfully, it works too.  Fast, quirky, and totally charming.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
very simple game but that nonetheless has a certain weight and caries interesting decisions. The game is made up of several pieces of strings that represent the different railways the players will lay down along with the borders of the maps, a mountain and a stream. On their turn, each player takes a card which represents a station worth between 0 and 3 points. They lay down the station and then, using one of their pieces of string, attempt to connect it to their network to score points. Since the playing area is quite small, you'll be running your railway to already placed stations to get some additional points from what the other players laid down. Fun, funny and quite short. Love it.

A novelty item for sure, but a fun little connection game with shoestrings.   Cards are drawn and then connected by each player's colors.   Luck of the draw plays a big factor.  There are a variety of different types of "stations" on the cards, but it doesn't quite achieve the sense of company ownwership that you get in a proper rail game.   So, you end up with a highly distilled crayon rail game that functions like connect the dots.  Scoring icons are poorly implemented graphically.  Loads of opportunities for off-color humor. Neat, but I can't see playing it very many times.

String Railway belongs to the "cute ideas that didn't quite make the cut" department. The underlying mechanism of placing strings as railroad tracks used to connect various stations on the board is pretty ingenious. Unfortunately, the game that was built around that idea is lacking in several ways.

First of all, the longer the game lasts the more fiddly it becomes. Both stations and track will get bumped and ever so slightly move around in the playing area. Now, this is a game where you are building routes to block your opponents, and a couple of millimetres can make or break the deal. Still, as short as the game is, you might just cover your ambition for a little while and move on.

More of an actual issue, however, is that the actual route building is rather unexciting and obvious. There aren't too many opportunities to effectively block your opponents, so the most you can hope for is to score a point ot two more than the competition or make them lose a point here and a point there. With that in mind, the station draws have quite an effect on the score and nullify much of the string placement at the heart of the game.

SR makes a compelling game out of shoelaces. It's built a lot on luck, but there are opportunities to plan wisely when dealt your luck. It is a game that can be pleasant to play as long as it isn't taken too seriously. Good-looking game and easy to teach. I think I'm less enamoured with the scoring system now, even if I still enjoy the novelty of string placement. But the highly luck-orientedness of the card pulls, coupled with some frustrating moments of calling rulings on string placement, just sort of wears on the novelty. A nice idea, but again, the scoring system is quite boring and it kind of kills the string-world that you create. I know this is a filler, but I wish there was some other perspective taken here to make the game feel a little more developed and interesting at all its points.

A very quaint game, comes in a strange but appealing long box with lovely art on the front, nice cardboard tokens, nice tiny square cards, and a bunch of strings make of the stuff used for shoe strings.  It's short and limits you to five moves, making each one count.  There's not too much depth, but plenty of strategy.  Not to mention the big black loop of string can always be bent into fun shapes to make game play interesting.  Grab it if you can find it.

Another maximize potential points on your turn game. What makes it unique is the use of string as abstract representations of rails. It also makes it very fungible as where the rails actually are tend to get fudged as people try to adjust their string just right. I suppose it should be taken as a light filler game but it wasn't particularly interesting or fun. I found myself somewhat annoyed with it.

Playing this was a rare experience, in that it was exactly as fun as I was expecting it to be. No more, no less. It's definitely worth playing just because it's so unique. But it's also very good. It has that Carcassonne-esque feeling of building a map as the game progresses, though with a very different flavor. The country stations can be very nasty blocking devices. It's a refreshing combination of cut-throat silliness. You can play very competitively, but you can't get too mad at anyone because you're all just playing with string. A great idea, flawlessly executed.

RATING: 5
This game fits the bill for when you're looking to string another one in or when you're trying to string along a someone who might not play too many games otherwise. All puns aside, or in other words, this is a quick, mildly dexterous, and spatial game with a yarned-up train aesthetic which is easy to jump right into. Turns are very quick (i.e., draw a station, lay the station, string it up, and score) so the action keeps moving at a brisk pace such that the game owns up to its 15-20 minute play time (as per advertised on the box).  

However, it is important that is not to be taken too seriously! Of course you play to win, but the winning here is not the goal -- but rather to have fun, and String Railway delivers. This means that this will not be a game of tremendous control, but rather a go-with-the-ride train ride. The small box and the modest cost made this an easy purchase I did not regret.

Need to play more to determine exact rating. Even though the rules were a bit difficult to digest at first, the game seems to accomplish what it sets out to do.

RATING: 5
A classic piece of inspired barminess, the kind of thing that the Japanese do well. Gameplay is utter simplicity: draw a tile and place it, then lay a piece of string 'track' to connect the valuable tiles and obstruct other players. Like most Japanese games it really could use a rules translation done by a native speaker and a good player aid in English. Tiles and strings are vulnerable to being nudged and the game's won and lost in whether you draw high value tiles or not, so nothing to be taken seriously, but straight out of the top drawer in terms of originality.

String Railway is a crazy concept which somehow works quite well.  Being able to move your string around and create tracks however you see fit is a really interesting, non-linear take on the railway building genre of game.  Also, using your string as ways of blocking others to your station, or forcing an opponent into a bad situation is unique and strategic.  This also affects yourself, never quite knowing how things will turn out based not only on the card you draw, but how the table has been set up on your opponents' turn.  Being only a few turns also helps the game move along and not get overly congested, but just enough to make each turn feel like it really matters.  Very enjoyable and original game.

After hearing all the initial hype, I was very disappointed by this game. The biggest problem is that the rules are too complicated for what needs to be a simple, easy to explain and game.

I would like to try it again before making a final judgment, but my initial feeling is disappointment.

It's not the most intellectually challenging game, nor the most emotionally stimulating game, nor does its theme light (normal) people up with a desire to play - but it's a game you play with string, and that novelty will charm the pants off of a lot of people.  I'm not saying you're soulless if you don't adore this game, but you might want to double-check anyhow.

There are three things I like about this game. First how people react when you open the box and they see that it really is a bunch of string. Second is the organic feel of the board as it develops. Third is watching adults cluster around the table and try to lay the string in the most intricate fashion possible. This is not a great game, but it's easy to bring it out for lots of people and its distinctiveness is enough to make it memorable.

RATING: 5
Four player game. First impression, greatly disappointed by what is an attractive idea but never gets close to expectations.  I feel it is at least two turns short - the space starts getting interesting and at that point you finish - or lacking variety in station cards (of the 35 cards 16 are just vanilla point scoring cards while another 8 are take another card which leaves only 11 that pose real questions) or even too open a space.  Some aspects are easily amended with some customisation but some, ignore the pun, are terminal.

What intrigued the other players at the start quickly petered out.  It feels ripe for customisation and I have a few ideas but there is little that motivates you to spend any further energy on the game.

RATING: 7
A very different take on railway games using (as the name implies) string to mark out the playing field, features and the railways themselves. The Asmodee edition adds a couple of nice details: The play boundary and the mountain range have been clamped, so no need for knots any more, and furthermore the boundary has two sets of marks, for 4 or 5 players (with three players you make a triangle with some marks overlapping, quite clever).

Rules are simple, and can be explained in 5 minutes, and a game takes around 20-30 minutes for 4 players. Components are nice, station graphics clear and easy to read, but the stations should have been printed on sturdier stock, I think.

I really like this game for its simple, yet surprisingly deep game play and wonderful visual appeal. - But to be completely honest, I think I'd prefer it's sibling: String Railway - Transport

Funny route building game that adds actual physical aspect to it, you get to decide the shape of routes by laying strings on table. It's maybe built around that one gimmick bit too much, I would've hoped for more decisions to make it more fun beyond first few games. Would be nice to try String Railway: Transport, but it's very hard to find compared to this, so I'm happy with owning at least this one. It's a nice game to play every now and then.

2-Player Comment:
*It takes some extra work to play with two (2 colours each) and isn't quite as intuitive, but at the end of the day it does work for two better than most big train games do.

The idea of this game is almost better than the gameplay.  It's really clever, and it's fun, but I've found that it lends itself to min-maxing when playing with gamers.

If you can keep this relaxed and social, I think the game might play better... sorta like having fun with crayons rather than using crayons to draw an exquisite picture.  It's hard to resist using this design to create a game that is more strategic than it should be.

Hilarious premise.  Placing the string down for the rails led to all sorts of strange contortions to score points.  Can be quite a lot of fun in the right move with non-competitive players, although not a lot to think about.  I feel there is an awful lot of the decision on who will win by the cards drawn.  Make sure you have a larger table!

This was so-so. It was a 3-player game, and the board got crowded very quickly. The board is built with strings, the players railroads are strings, and the tiles you draw and place are very light and flimsy so the whole thing feels very delicate and unstable. We didn't have too much of a problem with stuff moving around, but I can see that being an issue.

It felt gimmicky; you have a starting station and each turn you draw and place a tile, then lay a string. The tiles will allow from 1-5 strings to connect to them, some reward the owner when other players connect, some will tax the owner when others connect (these are worth more points). Each player gets 5 strings IIRC. It feels pretty basic and kind of blah. I feel like if it didn't have strings (WACKY!!!!11) it probably wouldn't have been published with its ruleset.

Not what I would consider a "railway" game. I know it has stations and rails - well strings...... but I think this is more of a spacial awareness game and to a certain extent a dexterity game!
That said this is a really fun quick filler type of game. You need a "large" table, and people who are not going to be upset if someone "moves" a string during the game.

Sheer genius of game design. An absolutely brilliant approach to utilizing the physicality of the board game. Manipulating the strings is incredibly engaging. The game is a shining example of elegance, too: String Railway allows very intricate (while still accessible to anyone) strategic and tactical manipulations with only a couple of paragraphs of rules governing them â the intricacy is in the physicality which is perfectly intuitive. From the design perspective â one of the best board games in existence!

First impression (5 players): Connect station tiles with your own railway (strings). Needs a big table if you want to give every player equal chances in a 5 player game because the game area needs to be pretty big pentagon. The game is light enough for this to be a non-issue if you just want to have a quick fun gimmick filler. There is also big luck factor on how the station tiles are drawn.

String Railway gets high marks for sheer WTF factor. We had people crowding round our table at London on Board to see what was going on. If you haven't seen a picture, you literally build railway lines out of lengths of string, attempting to connect station cards. Some of the stations seem slightly unbalanced, and it's impossible to be rigorous about the rules when strings and stations are going to get nudged. But that's really not the point. This is a 5-turn, 20 minute filler with more to think about than you would expect, and it's a blast.

Nice micro game in which measuring distances by eye is really helpful, since you first build stations and then try to connect them with single string. So this is one of very few (non miniature) games, which really have continuous space as an element. 

The gameplay is fine, while there is quite some luck which kind of stations you draw and if just a situation arises, which lets you score a lot of points.

Two Player Value = Fair. With only two players each player must use two colors each which for me brings the game down a bit.

Three Player Value = Good.


String Railway is an interesting and new take on "train" type games.

However, it does not feel like a "train" game. While players do build track, they do not make deliveries. That is because at the games base, it is not a "train" game at all. It is an abstract game.

As a competitive abstract game, String Railway is very good. The game is simple to learn which makes it accessible to all levels of gamers.

Each turn the player lays a station inside the play area. Then the player uses one of his strings to try to connect the newly laid station to other previously laid stations. The more station connected the better.

This is a clever new way to build rails and manipulating the string rail is fun. Carefully bending the string to fit it around other tracks and obstacles is very cool.

The difficulty of the game can fluctuate to match the experience of the players. This is accomplished by changing the size and shape of the play area and is a wonderful way to change the game to adapt more or less experienced players.


Pros - 
- Easy to learn
- Fun mechanic of laying strings to connect stations
- The games difficulty can increase with oddly shaped play areas

Cons - 
- The game can lead to Analysis Paralysis for some players 
- The play area can big large and requires a large table
- The game just feels and looks like something you can make at home for free

Adorable and clever game. Place string as track to connect stations for varying scores. Not real deep, but quite thematic and does reward good planning.
Made a homemade version to play until the real one comes out. Anyone need a ton of spare string? :p

Finally have the Asmodee version, which is frankly disappointing. The string is great, but the art on the tiles is lackluster (even our homemade version looks better) and the score counters are much less usable than a score track.

tl;dr: a bit too basic

I like the idea for this game. A train game where you use strings to 'lay' track. But this was just a bit too basic for me, and there certainly is a big dose of luck with the stations you draw. This seems to have a bit impact on the outcome.
It is a quick and easy game, and it's not unenjoyable, I just hoped for just a tiny bit more.

Very cool rail game played with a set of strings. The "board" is a long looped shoelace looking string that is arranged in different shapes depending on player count. The set up also includes another smaller loop inside to represent the mountains and a long straight one that represents a river. Each player has a starting station that they must build from and each turn draws and plays a cardboard tile that represents other stations, junctions, terminals all with different connectivity rules (#players, awarded points). All players have a set of 1 long and 4 shorter strings so there are 5 total turns. There is a points penalty for crossing other strings. The complete free form nature of the route building is so great.

RATING: 6
A pleasant, fun game that is quick to explain and play. The game asks you to optimize placement of various railway stops and the connecting track. Track (along with the board boundaries, rivers, and mountains) are represented with pieces of high-quality string. You choose a random card, place it, and then lay down a piece of your colored string. The more cards on the table you can connect with that single piece of string, the more points you score. The player with the most points at the end of a snappy five turns, wins.

At its heart, String Railways is about spatial optimization. It's very light, but leaves room for clever plays. That said, the random card draws, especially in such a short game, can lead to windfalls. In addition, because everything is represented with string, it's very easy for things to move around on the table. This makes the entire affair seem more fragile and subject to accidental (or even nefarious) bumping as players try to squeeze their card and string onto an increasingly constrained play area.

It's a fun game, but not anything I'd seek out.

String Railways is a fairly simple game. There's a string border that defines the play area. You randomly seed the board with a mountain loop of string and a river string. Then on your turn you draw a card, play it on the board, and then use one of your strings to create a path. Cards score points for player in different ways, but are limited on how many people can touch them.

The game is fairly quick and more of a filler game than anything else. Unfortunately it doesn't feel quite finished. There's a different version of the game that includes pick-up-and-deliver and engine upgrading which may be what this game needed.

RATING: 6
A very unique game and quite a different take from the traditional rail building game. Players use string to represent train tracks and the board itself is limited by the string which represents the outer border of the play area. A decent-sized table is therefore a prerequisite for playing this game. Detractors for this game cite the ease at which components shift around during game play, leading to a small amount of frustration in string placement. While not a deal breaker, I can see how this can be frustrating since picking up and laying down strings can really cause a ripple effect that leads to component displacement. I also do not quite appreciate the spatial aspect of the game. Guess how long a string is needed to complete the track is not my cup of tea. There were several occasions where I failed to make a connection due to selecting an incorrect string. I will keep the game due its novelty.

Not a lot of game here, but it plays quickly and the gimmick has some charm.

Using strings as tracks may be imprecise but it's pretty innovative.

Interesting gimmick grafted onto uninspired gameplay.  Tile draws have a huge impact on the winner, and the rest is usually determined by chaos.  Players can definitely lose simply because the breaks didn't go their way.  This is okay in a less dry take-that game, but in a wannabe Euro, this lack of balance feels really out of place.

(after 1 3p game)  An interesting use of string in a game.  Ended quicker than I thought it would.

If you're looking for one-of-a-kind games, look no further than this one.  It's a routes-connection game that uses string as your line, and cards/tiles as your stations.  It probably isn't a perfect game (the random card/tile draws can lead to some powerful combinations), but there's a nice tactical edge to it, as only a certain number of players can touch some locations, and careful placement on the table will effectively block other players.  It's definitely worth trying, if nothing else.

Original idea for a train game. Do not play too seriously, and try to use some non-slippery playmat so strings would remain in place.

Light, fun, fast, and an interesting mess of a "board" by the time you're finished.

One the finest, most fun, and innovative games around. Only to be played with people of a suitably joyful outlook. Too much competitive spirit will suck the fun right out it.

This is a game that will get some laughs due to how abstract it is, but once people get playing you should expect some more laughs as people try to figure out the best way to finagle their "train lines" through all of your stations.

very fast and light game. Family likes it - 7yo, loves it! Gamer friends find it too light, too in-exact... but it is a good filler game.

Definitely on the abstract end of things - "imagine that this square is Japan..."

What a disappointment. This looked like a great little neat quirky design. The tactile feel and appeal cannot be understated--for that reason alone the game is worth checking out if you're interested.

However the game that's actually there is really disjointed from the string itself. There are so many missed opportunities for using string as a game piece. Connecting stations is mostly just boring. Interaction with other players breaks down into uninteresting decisions and most players stick to themselves.

I love this game. It tickles all the right parts of my brain. It's so much fun to figure out the best way to maximize points, and it's neat to see the "board" at the end of the game, sprawling across the table.

Cool toyish train game where you place strings on tthe table to represent your train lines. Stations are small tiles which you try to connect with the strings, and they're worth a various amount of points and may have a player (company) limit. As the strings move a bit, this can't be played extremely competitively, but it's a very cool game.

Original gameplay, but too random.
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

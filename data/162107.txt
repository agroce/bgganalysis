A neat quick-ish multiplayer puzzle game with the right dose of luck thrown in.

Some dice are cast, players draft dice in order to fill in roads on their city grids, and points are scored for those roads depending on what things you connect up and/or how long roads are.

Overall, a fun little game that I'd probably always play if someone suggested it.

RATING: 5
Doodle City is a simple, quick dice game in which players draft dice to build (read: draw) roads throughout their city. Each road built potentially triggers a different type of scoring. I was worried that the symetrical player boards would produce tightly clustered scores, but I was pleased by the amount of seperation between players (even if I was at the tail end of that seperation). I'd play it again if we needed to kill time, but it's not the sort of game that I would bother suggesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cute game, but ultimately harmless. Very very luck dependent. Feels like it follows typical game patterns, aim for infrastructure early on (houses, cabs, and connected roads) and point earners later on (shops and buildings). But you are sooooo at the mercy of the dice that you be forced often to builds roads in pointless areas, AND the penalty of losing a tree and missing a turn is brutal, and it happens all too often that the dice are rolled such that you can't make any moves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've only played this solo, but it feels like a blast every time. I look forward to the drafting aspect, especially if people are cutthroat enough to peek at others' cities to hatedraft them.

Very, very good. Drafting and the race to ever-higher numbers make this a great game, built around the classic conundrum: fewer points now, or a chance for more later?

Doodle City is a charming dice game in which you try to 'doodle' a profitable road system through a city based on a simple 2d6 dice roll. It may look simple, but scoring highly isn't as easy as it looks, as each and every square through which a road may be drawn can only be chosen once... so there's a lot of commitment in early stages of the game! There isn't a lot of actual game to be found here (apart from screwing each other over with careful dice selection), but as a relaxing game to kick off a gaming day with, or as a nice little one-for-the-road, it more than serves its purpose. I'm happy to note that the risk of a blind purchase has paid off handsomely for a change.

The fact that everyone I played with to date has requested an empty score sheet to copy for themselves says enough, really. I apologise to the developers as this more or less counts as lost sales, but perhaps you can make up once the apps finally make it out of the beta stage...?

[b][FirstImpression28thOCT2014][/b] An entertaining game in the same vein as Qwixx, which is a game that I'm fond of. Doodle City offers a slightly more challenging way of scoring, in a way that you have to create a certain connection to get higher points. Different feature scores differently and requires it's own way of connection.

I played 2-player game twice and I enjoyed it a lot. In the beginning of every play, you'll roll a die to decide the street for the green fields. This ensures that every game is different, which is pretty neat.

It's puzzly, plays quickly and is a lot of fun! Bonus that it plays up to 6.

A roll-and-write game in the vein of Qwixx but more complicated, a little too long, and feeling much more restrictive. Since you often need exact results to complete valuable roads and especially in the later seats the dice selection is much reduced (often quite purposefully because people don't get anything useful to do so they naturally choose the dice other players could use best) it seems to be less about making decisions and more about just getting lucky more often than the other players.

A clever idea for adding spatial elements to the Qwixx genre, implemented so painfully that I barely want to give it credit for that. (The problem being that too often the game plays itself, and the rate of "oh, I guess I'm stuck" turns goes up as it ends, leaving a bad taste.)

Redeeming factor: "How long is this path at the moment it reaches this space" is a neat mechanic.

Doodle City is an awesome little game.  I like how the game changes depending on the dice.  Even though there's that luck factor, there's usually a choice which adds an enjoyable factor to the route building process.  I also like how you create your own path, but you rarely get in a situation where you feel you're stuck.  Pretty darn fun, even as a solo game.

An original concept somewhere in between a game and a toy. Too long to be a filler, not enough to offer for a full-fledged game.

The solo game offers little but a push-your-luck dice-rolling procedure and high scores are, in the end, achieved by luck. I tend to think the multiplayer game will not be much better, since you will often have as little or less control, and there should be little satisfaction in inspecting the boards of other players to determine precisely whether it's worth it to make a worse move in order to hurt them just a little more.

This is so light, it could easily be a kid's game. Light, light, light. But man, I do enjoy it!  It's very satisfying to engineer your tiny city and over repeated plays you do get quite a lot better at doing so.  And, so far, there isn't one unbeatable route to victory, which is nice for such a light game.  You play tactically, based on how the dice roll, but you certainly have some control over how your city turns out in the end. *adore*

I've only played it solo so far, but I find it an enjoyable and even addicting game. I think I might describe it as a puzzle game with a push-your-luck element. It's reminiscent in some ways of other dice-and-pen-and-paper games like Qwixx and Rolling America (with elements of both) but the different ways of scoring brings it to a new level. A city-building element to a this sort of game is unexpected, and while it may not be the most thematic game, its scoring is not dissimilar to other light city-building games. It's definitely light, but recommended for people who like puzzle or spatial elements to their games.

Everyone in turn order gets a chance to draft a die, which allows you to draw on a grid to get points. The game was essentially a solo experience, where you had to wait for a long time while people figured out how to gain points.

RATING: 2.5
13-06-2015. Rated after 1 play. In this game, you roll 1 blue die, and X+1 white dice where X is number of players. Each player, starting with the starting player chooses one of the dice. You then draw roads in the squares, based on the coordinates equaled by the dice. The roads you draw may be into any direction you want as long as you connect two sides of the square. If you connect a road with a hotel and if this is the largest road you previously connected to a hotel you score VPs equal to the highest value you equaled or exceeded on your scoring sheet. Same goes for stores (only then you count connected houses). If you ever connect taxi's, they're worth 4 points each. If you cannot or do not want to pick a die, you lose one of your trees. If anyone ever has lost 6 trees or has obtained the highest score for hotels or stores the game ends.

I dislike it. It's very solitairish. I dislike drawing on pads as a mechanism and I dislike drawing. It's extremely light and I really don't care for it. Can be an interesting gateway or work great with children, but I am not interested enough to partake in more games of this.

Doodle City is a dice drafting game in which dice provide coordinates for a grid. What I find rather clever is that players have a choice in where to direct the roads in the box that they pick, and a lot of scoring depends on how well they can connect the roads. As the game progresses, each player will value combinations a little differently depending on how their roads link. The variable set-up is also handled simply but effectively.

By virtue of it being a dice game, there is quite a bit of luck involved especially when you have last picks in the draft. It would have been nice if there was some flexibility for those last in the draft apart from having to strike out a tree and miss the turn. As a result, the luck-tactics balance is slightly askew for a 'heavy' dice filler. This game is also meant for lower player counts as it moves at a sluggish pace with 5 players on board.

五人局，大家都非常投入，相當有趣！
感覺像是[thing=131260][/thing]的2D城市主題版，旅館、商店、計程車有不同計分方式，考驗玩家預留彈性的規劃能力，當然也跟擲骰結果有相當程度的關係，手氣不順只好用砍樹來抵分數，還算滿符合都市規劃的情境(笑)。
一局時間不長，每個人都很有事做，雖然互動不高，但是看到別的玩家路線被卡死會很歡樂。
推薦！
:star::star::star::star::nostar:

Feel like [thing=131260][/thing] with a 2D city map. Different scoring for Hotels, Shops, and Taxi lays a bit depth for players' strategy thinking. Although the dice rolls and player order (rotate clockwisely each turn) makes it luck-dependent, but you may always cut down trees to buffer your choices, which matches the city planning theme quite well.
Play in short time, keep everyone busy in their own map, little interaction but lots of laughs when seeing someone's streets got blocked.
Recommended!

I'm not sure who this game is supposed to be for.  It looks like it is for kids with the cutesy look and feel and kids love to draw on things but the scoring rules are a little more complicated than kids would understand.

But of course it can't be for adults, especially not gamer adults because there's barely any game here.  It's just rolling dice and being given options based on those rolls on where you can draw a line and then scoring points in somewhat convoluted ways based on where you drew a line.

In the end there's very little for this game to offer anybody.

This is a simple dice game and while there are some strategic choices to be made, it is mostly a luck fest. If people (or you) don't roll what you want/need, then you're screwed.

Very clever dice drafting game. Unlike dice games where everyone gets the same roll and has to make the best of it (see Rolling Japan), Doodle City sets people competing over a pool of dice where everyone will get to choose just one. Then you have to try to optimize your city streets for point-scoring opportunities. Combined with the progressive scoring requirements and you have a game that builds tension naturally without over-complicating things. Lovely filler.

Draw streets to your city. Good strategy seems to be having one long street collecting as many properties on it as possible.

One of those filler games that is all about fun and is not to be taken seriously.

It's an okay game for a filler. I'm not crazy about it but it's not bad. Worth the money at the very least.

Massively overhyped. Played solo and two players. If there is a game in here then I missed it. Dull as dishwater.

It's barely a game. Feels more like a pass-time activity.

RATING: 4.5
Not a great first impression, but willing to try again with 3 (or maybe 4) people. The problem was that the blue die constantly rolled a 1 or 4, so that got really annoying.

I played this at SPIEL as Daniel and I walked by the booth and spotted an empty table. It was very enjoyable, and upon leaving the fair I bought one of the last few copies for a great deal.

The game consists only of the scoring pad and a handful of dice, I wish they had included more variant scoring pads, but I'm sure we'll see some in the future.

Before Spiel 2014 started, I became interested in this game. The concept of it, was very easy to explain and there weren’t many components involved in the game. This could be a nice family-filler-game, like Qwixx. Just put it on the table, and people would grab the game, when they have some time left. Then I got to know the price of the game. 15 Euro’s for 8 dice and 100 small sheets. That’s just ridiculous, and way, way too much overpriced. Nevertheless, we played the game at the convention, and we liked it. But that price! No way, we would pay that. We brought home our sheets we used (which accidentally seemed to have an unused sheet behind it). We scanned in the blank sheets, laminated them, bought some dice and whiteboardmarkers and put the game on the table (we spend a total of EUR1.45). Now we play the game, as we have 15 minutes left. Use a whiteboardmarker to write on the laminated sheets, and a piece of paper when you’ve finished the game. In the last couple of weeks, this game became the most played game of 2014. But still, not worth 15 Euro’s. Great game, that could be a very big hit, when the price is lowered to less then EUR10,-

Kind of a big, wooden, Euro version of Gnip Gnop.  There's really not much here, so either you're into this or you aren't.  I'm not, mostly because I suck at it :)  Those loud wooden THWACKing sounds, though, are kind of fun.  Well, for a bit, anyway.

I've never seen anyone who could control the thingies at speed, so it becomes an example of large-scale brownian motion ... which is fine in the Science Museum, but not much of a game.

Oh My Gawd! This is about the most addictive fun that you can have in 30 seconds! Everyone and I mean EVERYONE that I've introduced this game to loves it and can't get enough of it. Games are fast and tense and you'll find yourself still playing "just one more game" an hour later. Great game!

A blast to play a quick five minute game any time. Guests, family and kids all alike enjoy it. Surprisingly, the kids do VERY well at it starting age 7 or 8 and often win against the adults.[Edit] I just started by 2 year old on it and he is having a blast! He is even able to send it through the trappe - although not reliably of course. It ends up being a source of real enjoyment for the whole family.[/Edit]

Worth Every Penny. I thought it would be a quick fling and people would only like it in passing, but my sister actually developed a blister over the holidays. I play it much more than Pitchcar. I love action/dexterity games---only Loopin Louie is as easy to dive into, but this is more competitive and just as much fun (not as silly though). By the way, forget the timer, play until someone gets all their disks to the other side (seriously upgrades laughing and drama).

I own the petit version.  I can't imagine that the game plays that much better on the grand version that it justified the additional cost and, more importantly, lack of portability and storage difficulties.

The game itself is simple, quick, and a whole lot of fun. Highly recommended to those who like action games--because it is not turn based, there is not much else on the market that plays this fast.  My rating could easily go up with more plays if i find that it doesn't get old too fast--it IS very simple.  I do worry that over time the elastic band could degrade, but I'm sure that it won't be too hard to replace at that point, even if I have to make the band myself.

The "Pucket" version from Et Games is beautiful, a thing of art. The sound of wood on wood and laughter is the sound of happiness.

One of the BEST games for hooking in game-sceptics. Some people seem naturally very good at it (myself included!) and some rubbish, which can limit the appeal for badly matched pairs - but on the whole excellent.

In childhood we had a much beloved [thing=5071][/thing] set. Pucket scratches the same itch, but its quick pace and portability make it a winner for me.

Kind of silly, but I could see this being very good with kids. The pucks don't seem to have as much glide as I think would be ideal, but overall it works pretty well. It is rather a large game to store and set up for how short and simple it is. Even so, it can be a pretty fun diversion. For the expense, Gnip Gnop can scratch the same itch.

I love Crokinole and I love Elchfest, but this takes dexterity games to a new level of excitement!!!  Not so much skill is needed though a good aim will go a long way. A rare gem that gets me hootin' and hollerin' while playing. This has gone straight to the top of our most played games at our youth group. The only problem I've experienced is that after a few hours of hearing the disks banging around, headaches abound!

Nice quick fun.  It takes some skill to do well, but it doesn't outstay its welcome due to the timer.  Very nice production, the discs slide very well.  It's fun to see them flying around, having your own bounced back to you as it collides with your opponent's discs.  I can see how some could take this very seriously and completely dominate their opponent, but for me it's light fun when you're in the mood for something different.

Fun game. Worth getting. BUT doesn't have many player playability like PITCH CAR or TUMBLIN' DICE.

As well, while the Micro version can be bought for about $25, the medium and larger versions sell for closer to $100.OUCH!!

Sizes:
Grande: 98cm x 53cm (38.5" x 20.75)
Petite: 60cm x 38cm (23" x 14.5") see www.pucket.co.uk
Micro: 34cm x 21cm (13" x 8")

Micro seems to be the size of a piece of letter-sized paper. I personally canNOT see how this can be engaging for longer than 15 minutes at a time.

I score this game high for 2 reasons. 1) The production quality (ET Games version) and 2) the joy it has brought to many of my family. I took this to a family event (Ihave a big family) and started to play it with my brother. We didn't announce it, we just sat down at a table and began to play. Before long we had people surrounding us, cheering, laughing and giving it a go themselves. A success for something so simple.

I wonder if I just didn't get it or I was told the "rules" wrong, but I see little in this game besides performing one thing exactly the same way over and over again as fast as you can.  You don't need to react to your opponent in any way and the games tend to be blowouts ending in an anti-climax.

This game reminds me of a quickie.  It is over before you know it, and thinking back you say to yourself "Well yes, I guess that was kind fun".  Fortunately, if you wanted to you, wouldn't have to wait a long time before you get to play again.  It is eye-catching.  Still, nothing too spectacular for the price, as it just feels repetitive to me.

The mini version doesn't have the panache as the large version.

This game is a blast -- fast, vicious, and chaotic!  If you like Crokinole, you'll probably like Passe-Trappe and yet it won't feel duplicative.  (On the other hand, if you don't already own Crokinole, I'd recommend buying that before you shell out the $$ for Passe-Trappe).

For what it's worth, we have the "mini" passe-trappe and it's certainly larger than the average boardgame (and a bit of a PITA to store because, of course, the playing surface doesn't fold).  I'm not sure that bigger would be better in this case.

RATING: 7.5

Super quick skill game -- it should be over in less than 5 minutes. Crazy, frenetic, and so much fun! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The game board is a walled rectangle divided in 2 by a wall with a puck-sized notch in the center, and an elastic band on each side.

- Setup: place your disks anywhere on your side, except in front of the slot. 
- Play simultaneously,  using only one hand, trying to get your disks to the other side by flinging with the rubber band THROUGH the hole. Anything going over the wall is returned. Disks in the hole may not be touched (must hit with another disk).
- Win: get all disks to the other side.

[u]Variants[/u]

- Best of 7
... use the (~45 sec) timer, play till someone wins 4 games.
... Win by having fewer disks on your side of the wall when the timer ends. If tied, tiebreaker = play another round with 5 disks each, first to get disk to the other side winning.
... If you get ALL your disks across before timer ends, counts as 2 wins. 

- Classic: best of 3

- Solitaire Madness
... solo, with timer
... place all 10 disks on your side your camp
... win by having fewer disks on your side than on the other 

- Solitaire Reflected
... solo, no timer, 20 tries
... try to pass as many disks as possible to the other side

- Not a laughing matter
... need 1 or 2 referees
... standard game
... if you see/hear opponent laugh: may lay down the timer, confirm the laugh and if so, place one of your disks on the other side. Then fix the timer and resume the game.

- Ambidexterity
... standard game, 2 rounds
... round 1: use your dominant hand, round 2: use the other

- THE BIG SLAM: play 4 variants, once each, earning points: 
... Solitaire Madness, Solitaire Reflected: 2 points per disk across the slot
... Classical: 30 points per round won
... Best of Seven: 30 points per round won

Petit version. Two player game similar to Gnip Gnop, except with wood discs, one opening and a thin bungee cord launcher. Addicting game that plays very quickly (<10 minutes).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In the realm of wooden games that you can buy in Target stores, this one isn't as good as Klask.

It does seem like a fun enough game to play on occasion though. You just quickly flick discs through a small opening in the middle of the board, trying to get all of the discs onto your opponent's side while they're doing the same thing in real time.

I didn't see it in the printed rulebook but online there are rules that suggest you should only play for 45 seconds per match and I think that's a good idea. There is potential for opponents to bat pucks back and forth with no real progress for a while.

I will also say that the construction is better than I expected for a mass-produced product like this. I was worried that the "string" might not hold up, but it is made of sturdy bungee material like you would use to attach something to a car. I can't see it getting worn down under normal use.

RATING: 5
Le Passe-trappe is a strange dexterity game where the winner is the first person to get all of the disks to the opponent’s side of the board. The trick is that there is only a small gap in the middle of the board through which the disks can pass. The second trick is that you have to bounce the disks off of a taut string at the back of your end of the board, rather than sliding them directly towards the other side. These two things combined make the game rather difficult for beginners, or at least for me, especially when you’re playing against Dan Karp, who later reveals that he owns the game!

The best way to play this is with a huge board - and those are expensive and difficult to transport.  Too bad.

Of the big four dexterity games-- here I am thinking of the most highly regarded table top dexterity games on bgg-- Pitch Car, Crokinole, Tumblin' Dice and Le Passe Trappe, I think LPT is my favorite.

The central difference between LPT and the other three is that LPT is 'real-time.' There is no down-time to think... no pausing and measuring and breath holding as one sets up the shot. This gives me the amazing feeling of "presence" as I play where everything else melts away: no thoughts about work tomorrow, did the kiddo eat enough vegetables, did I remember to call  this person back, did I make the appointment to fix the car? All of that disappears in the complex mash up of frenetic slings and relaxed ritual of pulling back the elastic over and over. I think it is the blissed-out joy of this perfect focus, the total absorption I feel in the few minutes this game lasts, that makes me love this dexterity game best of all.

There will always be a place in my heart for Pitch Car and Crokinole (Tumblin' Dice not so much.) But if I could only keep one, LPT would it.

**As an aside I have the big version, and while initially I wanted the medium to have the benefit of portability, I found it easy enough to carry the big one to game night. And, I am now absolutely thrilled to have the big size. I think a game this magnificent really deserves-- insists-- upon the meaty disks and the crushing thwacks. Playing small would be like chopping Texas in two: it just wouldn't make sense to take something whose orbit of metaphor is bigness and shrink it down for the dismal mandates of convenience.

War of attrition.  Still fun, but also tedious.

Mucho fun on a small board. I could see burning out if I play too often, but in best-of-five matches, it should be good for years. Best of all, I think it's a super way to get other people playing games. I mean, geez, who could resist trying this game if you saw someone else playing it?

Played Essen 2007. A fun dexterity game about firing wooden discs across a table. Fast and frantic.

Le Passe-Trappe is a great dexterity game and something we always play a tournament of at SPIEL each year. The object is to get all your disks over to your opponent's side of the board, and it is played in real time, just go as fast as you can, but accuracy is key. I highly recommend it.

Frenetic game that is fun, but just enough nerve-wracking that one or two plays at a time is plenty for me.

I have both the large and small versions.  The small version is quite portable and I bring it everywhere.  The big version's disks are nice and heavy.

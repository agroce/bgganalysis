Very good game, with a nice new mechanism of trading actions.  It adds some anxiety because of the continuous petitions from Rome, which cannot always be satisfied.  Looks like it has several different possible strategies.  Materials are quite good, it is not a too complex game, and offers about 60 minutes of really good game.

Fortuna is the second game I buy made by Game Master BV, after the very good Opera. The artwork is even better than in Opera, but it seems they manufactured the game in China, this time, and the overall quality of the production is lower (cheaper wood, opaque and lavish paint on wooden components, unusual sized unsleevable cards).
The game has a pretty unusual action selection mechanic, where every player has only 3 of the 12 actions available, and after performing the action must give it away anc take (and reserve) another action.
Fortuna is a lighter game, plays smoothly and is quick enough for a game of this weight. There's luck in the game, but nothing excessive: it's the right amount for a quasi-family game.
I am not the target of such game, but I can appreciate its merits and would gladly play it again.

RATING: 7.5
Surprisingly engaging and entertaining game. I like how no one can perform the same action twice in a row, and I think many of the mechanics are brilliantly done. Having the first player card is a huge advantage (especially in a two-player game, where screwage is crucial), but it can also cripple you in terms of limiting your choices during your turn.  I also like how getting to the city center first is not necessarily an advantage if you don't plan out a winning strategy in advance. 

What I wasn't crazy about, however, was that the only way to score points was by picking up the privilege cards. This means that the only way to win is to roll a die that enables you to take favors with tokens on them. I happened to get a couple in a row with two or three tokens, and since I had the Basilica, I was able to keep two privilege cards every time. By the end of the game I had twice the privilege cards of everyone else, all basically because of luck. But what else do you expect from a game called "Fortuna"?

I think the name is fitting as you need help from Dame Fortune to win this game... And that's bad! I like the idea, but the implementation lacks a lot. You can get screwed big time by rolling low numbers; I needed a 3 and rolled a 2+1. Later on I needed a 3 again and rolled a 2+2... Also, the role cards are cool but imbalanced and I had one which never got picked, so I was basically screwed in the game. Sure, it might be because I hadn't played it before so didn't know about the strategy etc., but overall there was just way too much luck involved in what felt like an otherwise fine eurogame.

Very surprised at how quickly this plays. There's a heavy advantage in turn order, and rolling well with dice gives rewards that other players will miss out on. The random draw of end if game victory cards bothers me a little. I applaud the mechanics of the game for being different and interesting. additionally, The game seems to play well with all player counts. Overall, I'll play it if in the mood because it's not a lengthy game and fits in as a change of pace from a usual Euro.

RATING: 5
Fortuna’s core ideas are cute. Although the game itself turns out to be a somewhat simplistic turn-resources-into-money-and-VPs title, the way the players are allotted their actions is interesting. On every side of the square board a player keeps three (different) action cards representing a simple action: get resources, purchase things, erect a building, and fo forth. When his turn comes, the player picks one of his own actions, carries it out, and then [i]exchanges[/i] that action card with another action card laying at the board side of another player. In order to prevent tit-for-tat exchanges, the card which has been taken is turned over before put in place: this locks it in place until the player's turn comes again. By necessity this game requires planning at least one move ahead, which is kinda cute.

There are other mechanisms at work, but the above is essentially what makes Fortuna Fortuna. When I played about to 2/3rd of the way through, my fellow players and I remarked that the game seemed to be a bit syrupy. We all wanted the same resources to start our various paths to VPs and money with, and given the small number of obvious actions to obtain them with the ‘friction’ it caused wasn't very pleasant. I asked Hans van Tol (the publisher) about this, and he explained that we hadn't been using the bribery card: this card allows the [i]use[/i] of an action card, even a temporarily locked one, for a small sum of money. The effect is obvious: more room to obtain core resources, and thus a (lot) more fluid game. 

All in all we weren't completely disappointed even with our somewhat restricted experience, but we weren't wowed either. This is simply to do with the fact that this sort of game doesn't really cut it for us anymore. No matter how you select your actions, it remains a somewhat simplified resource-to-VP engine with multiple paths to victory. If there was anything to gripe about at this early stage of learning the game, it is the minor errors and inconsistencies in the iconography; and for me personally the somewhat muted appearence of the game board. If I had to compare Fortuna’s complexity and scope to another game, I'd put World’s End high on my list, even though in execution the games are miles apart. I wouldn't say no to a few more games, that's not a bad result.

[b]Update[/b] In a subsequent rematch I found myself short on all resources and was not enjoying the game much especially since cards I needed to stock up again were continuously taken and locked. It wasn't until the end when someone pointed out that one card which is rarely taken by resource growers had an alternative function: free stuff. If only I'd known... In any case, the lackluster feeling Fortuna left on the previous occasion persisted, so I'm not sure I'm going to attempt a third game.

Fortuna is a good one.  The board looks great & it fits very well with the components.  It felt natural calling the resources by the proper names because of they were on the board...meaning to say that it was "pass me a water" versus "pass me a blue".  Minor, but more thematic.
You can not always do what you want, but there is most always something to do.  Good player competition, good choices on how to make your victory points, good decisions, and good end-game scoring.
Very cool game.

It seems there's missing a way to manage wrong throws. You can only add dice but you cannot add to the results. It does not matter whether you will throw 1 x 1 or 3 x 1 in terms of the outcome. Other than that the game is ok.

RATING: 5
The game is playable, and the rotating role selection works, but beyond that it fails. Lucky dice rolls and gaining bonus cards that give the right reward create WAY TOO MUCH of a point swing to cancel out all of your careful resource managing and clever plays.

For example, I played a game where the score between all players went from 22-34. In my last turn I rolled a '6' and was able to get 3 points that turn (had I rolled a 1-5, I would have gotten 0). That is a huge point swing on one turn compared to what the total score could be for the whole game.

Willing to play it again anytime.

Our first play didn't go down well with the group and I was considering moving this title on.  However we persevered and tried again and this time the group seemed to enjoy the game.  We've since played this several more times and I'll be keeping this title in the short term.

The mechanism is interesting in that each play has 3 action cards available on their turn.  Once they have chosen and played an action, it is then swapped with one of the two face up actions of another player (one action is kept face down - protected).   The resources that are used in the game are also quite interesting - Wine, water, Soldiers and Virgins!  I don't think there is another game like this anywhere :)

Even great game designers have some downs. This one definitely is.

There are some clever and innovative mechanisms in this game that are glued together in an almost unplayable mix. Some actions and their interconnections are so artificial that even an die-hard eurogamer may have problems with understanding why it is this way and not another.

Playing Fortuna was a hard work for me. Pleasure - none. Fun - absent. Joy - what is that?

I really enjoyed my first play with four people.  It has nice tactical choices and does not overstay its welcome.  If you are bothered by luck, I don't think you will like it.  Dice plus the privilege cards are a bit too much, but for a thinky family game, it is totally worth it.

The mechanic of executing action cards and then exchanging them with other players is interesting, but with usually just one action per turn, it takes a long time to get something done. And the excessive randomness - not surprising for a game whose name means "Luck" - can be very frustrating. You must contribute to Rome every turn or pay a penalty, but the range of what you can contribute is determined by how high is your die roll. The only other way to score is via prestige cards at the end of the game, but the same die roll may also prevent you from drawing them. Besides, half of them give benefits other than victory points, and of course they are drawn randomly.

Sort of an "Agricola Lite".  Action selection game with 3 basic resources (water, wheat, wine), 2 advanced resources (militia, virgins), money (for paying taxes), and 3 actions available on any given turn.  As an action, you can build structures (improvements).  After playing an action, you trade that action for one in front of another player, securing it as a possibility for the next turn.  VPs are represented by moving towards the centre of Rome, and picking up various extra point-scoring cards along the way.  First to get to Rome gets choice of an extra scoring card.

Simple and quick to play, easy to learn, with several possible paths to victory.  Much lighter (and simpler) than Agricola et al.  Best with 4 players.

Played at Ludo-Outaouais, November 2011.

Al wie binnen stadsmuren staat wanneer eerste speler in Rome aankomt, kan nog winnen. Leuk kaartenkiessysteem (eigen kaart spelen, en dan wisselen met een van andere speler). Geld bekom je door te trouwen, graan, water of wijn te verkopen; maagden en soldaten laten extra acties toe. Strategisch, met naar mijn smaak iets te  grote geluksfactor omdat je op einde van elke ronde moet dobbelen voor je punten.

A perfectly cromulent game - solid euro-y VP engine type game with some die rolling thrown in for good measure. I like how quickly the game plays.

So it's not one I'd seek out, but I'm perfectly happy to play it from time to time.

Can't believe my beloved Game Master used China components this time, esp after the all-too-excellent components in Opera!
The gaming components is simply sub-par compared with most German boardgames.
Concerning the gameplay, the key is the '12 different cards and you got to choose from 3' system, which is quite refreshing. However, I think the game drags a bit with 4 players (but won't be that suited for less than 4 because of action card distribution) with quite significant down-time. 
Overall impression is quite good and got good replayability. Just don't use China components again!

This is a fairly average medium-light Euro.  I like the player interaction, but in the end it doesn't feel like player interaction so much as simply a game mechanic.  As the name suggests, there is quite a lot of luck in the game.  It would make for a good family game, though I think it wouldn't be a great gateway game as there are a lot of symbols to understand (though the iconography is done well), and you have to understand most or all of the cards before you feel you understand the game.  I'll play it, but will probably choose other games before I choose this.

I really enjoyed this after one play. It is called Fortuna, so it's probably not a shock that there's so much luck in this game, from the rolls of dice to which privileges you get -- and to boot, these are game-deciding elements. There's an element of increasing your odds, but it still often comes down to a roll of the dice. It is possible that this level of luck will aid in replayability, my fear being that my delight after the first play comes from novelty value. (It's worth noting that my fellow players, some of whom favor heavy euros, were also delightfully surprised) The main weight of the game comes from the selection of actions and then the reservation of the actions in the following rounds -- there are a multitude of considerations, and the 12 available actions form a well-balanced, interwoven set of concerns, from supply chaining to making money to increasing one's odds, set against the backdrop of individual hidden goals. For a game with this much luck, you have to think 2, 3, 4 steps ahead in order to link your supply chain and build the thing you want, obtain the resources you need, in order to take maximum advantage when you roll your dice and have to satisfy the emperor's favors.

The action selection scheme is interesting and original, and you are always in a desperate need of a specific resource. Drawing the game end VP tickets early seems too dominant, especially with three players. And the cards are not even drawn for plotting your strategy but just because they run out quickly.

Very cheap Chinese production, with weird card size. The game board is of exceptionally low quality and its washed out colors look out of place.

The race is on to Rome, be quick though as there is only room for one winner! You there yet? You start with 3 actions cards and must swap the cards with the other players.  Once you swap a card with another player the next player goes and they cannot swap the previously swapped card.These actions allow you to build buildings, collect muses and the rest of the Rome miscellaneous based goods. There lies the dichotomy in this game, you are rushing to finish the game and not collect resources to get the most influence/respect points. Madness! The fall of Rome! Yes! There seems to be one strategy and that is to roll good dice. That's the least interesting part of the game, which I had not mentioned for the same reason. It's a shame for the game as I haven't seen the mechanic with cards anywhere else, this game was so close to positively utilising it.

Didn't make the cut as I felt there was limited strategy. It didn't go down well with my gaming group either. On the pros I would play it again as it was quick, which I guess in a race is the point- but not in a euro game?

Há aqueles jogos que nos contagiam de tal forma que apetece jogar, jogar, jogar e voltar a jogar consecutivamente – este é um desses! Fortuna é um jogo de grande complexidade no processo, cheio de escolhas, muito completo, mas também muito simples de o jogar, o que é raro! O tema encaixa perfeitamente e o artwork é magnífico. OBRIGATÓRIO!

This game has you racing to Rome, all the while fulfilling the insatiable and twisted desires of the emperor. You pick up resources of various types through selecting an action from cards you control. The spin is that when you use this action, you MUST trade it to another player for one of theirs. So unless they use it and trade it back, it's difficult to use the same action twice in a row. These actions may allow you to gain favor from the emperor. The favor cards either help you during the game or give you bonuses for specific things at the end of the game.
I actually enjoyed this and will look for it, if the cost isn't too wacky.

*Strongly* reminiscent of [b]Principato[/b] (and released the same year), both are light-weight, engine-building euro games that utilize an "activate-then-exchange" mechanism for its action cards. Ironically, our group played both games back-to-back and were astonished as to their similarities - if you played one you have the basic core concept of the other.

Which one is better?

Well, [b]Principato[/b]  has no dice rolling so right away it's less random... But, the action cards in [b]Principato[/b] is more random due to its card drafting mechanic as opposed to [b]Fortuna[/b]'s constant set of twelve actions to swap between, therefore actually making it difficult to plan ahead while long-term planning is quite possible in [b]Fortuna[/b]... That being said, the secret goal cards are not as overpowered and have a strict limit of two per a player in [b]Principato[/b] - whereas a single player could binge on collecting goal cards in [b]Fortuna[/b] - therefore making [b]Principato[/b] much more balanced... But, [b]Fortuna[/b] is clearly the more streamlined of the two, making it a breeze to teach newcomers...

It's a toss up!

[b]Fortuna[/b] may be the better [i]gateway[/i] game due to it being more streamlined while [b]Principato[/b] may be the better [i]gamer's[/i] game due to having slightly more control and complexity.

Both will remain in my collection as I am a sucker for engine-building games and both have enough unique subtleties to prevent both experiences feeling the same - only the same flavor.

This is very quickly becoming a very good game. There doesn't seem to be a lot of luck at all and that which there is can be mitigated by buying extra dice or building the building that allows you to choose more privilege cards.

It plays in about 40 minutes with 2 players and not much more with 3.

Wow.   I really want to like this game.  Like the theme, like the fact that it graced the cover of Speilbox, like the game board,  like the fact that you trade in Virgins, and get to have orgy's with wine...  

But...  Fidgety comes to mind.  And wow, it can drag sometimes waiting for your turn.  The back to back turn can be cool, but the 1st to last...  Waiting for 6 complete turns until your next, painful, especially if you are set with your strategy and victory points cards, and now exactly what you are going to do next turn.

In our game one player got the wheat and wine victory point cards, and got them early... had the aqueduct, and basically just racked up wheat and wine, while we watched helplessly and played for second.   

There is a HUGE luck factor obviously, based on what you draw and what you roll.  I of course knowing my luck in dice rolling games, immediately did my due diligence to get the three dice max...  But it all became too painful rolling , 1,2,1, and 3,1,1 and on and on, while the guy next to me kept popping 5 and 6's with one and two dice!

Anyway the good news is you don't have to worry about what you eat before game night (hell eat burritos), because you will have definitely have some spare time to use the restroom.   By the way in a 4 player game, good luck knocking this one out in the 60 minute box time.  

In the end I have tons of games, and I look for the best in all of them...  Call me forgiving, after all we are pawning Virgins in this one... Hail Caesar!

With all that said, there is some fun elements, and I believe it is thematic, and a bit fun.

Happy Gaming - Tiets

The players are ambitious Romans striving for influence in the Roman Empire. While striving for power, happiness and wealth, they leave their own village and travel towards the City of Rome. The road to Rome is long and there are many ways to reach your life purpose. As a hardworking farmer you can work the land and grow large quantities of grain and wine. A clever farmer irrigates the land to improve the yield of his harvest. Trading your harvested goods for the best price may bring you the means to move up the ladder of the Roman hierarchy. When will you decide to move on and buy yourself an army of Centurions? Or will you choose the sacred way of Religion and serve the ruthless Roman Gods? Along the way, you will have the opportunity to find happiness and wealth in marriage. Will you take this chance to become happy or not? If you contribute well to the Roman Empire, you will grow in the favor of the Emperor and move further to Rome. Will the citizens of Rome welcome you jubilantly?

Coming nearer to Rome and the Emperor's Palace the tension in the game becomes higher. Which of the players has contributed most to the Empire? And which of the players has saved the city in times of crisis? Just when water and food supplies become exhausted or Centurions are needed to protect Rome against a hostile invasion, only the most prestigious Romans show their courage and value. The Emperor will reward this Roman with golden Fortuna coins, and the deeper the crisis, the more affluent this reward will be. When a player has reached the centre of Rome, only the player who has done most for the Emperor and the People of Rome will become Victorious.
Make sure to be in the City of Rome so you are able to take that triumphal march to Victory!

A very nice way to select the actions, where just 3 actions are available to you, and then you can swap one for one of an other player. As the title suggests, there is some luck involved. But still plenty of things you can plan. The length and the level of luck involved are in a good balance, so it is not killing your plans, but forces you to adjust them.

RATING: N/A
Fortuna is an interesting action drafting game where there are 12 possible actions, spread around the 4 different sides of the board. On your turn, you perform one of the actions on your side of the table, then swap this action for one of the other 9 actions another player possesses. This action is protected from being taken, so you will always be able to perform it next round if you wish. So in this way, you chain your actions together to form your overall strategy. And if you know an opponent needs an action, you can take it from them, of course.

After your action, you roll a die, and can do 1 of 6 possible "favours" depending on what you rolled. Rolling a 3 lets you choose 1-3, a 6 allows 1-6 and so forth. Turn order is important, as each favour can only be done once per round, so if the other players have taken 1-3 and you roll a 3, you're screwed. Doing the favour scores you a point, so you want to do this.

I thought the game was ok, but the luck factor was a bit high for me, even though I'm usually very tolerant of randomness in games. I got married early in the game, hoping the extra points it would generate through the favours would pay off. But I didn't roll a single 5 or 6, and it never paid off even once. I spent several turns acquiring the stuff needed to get a second die to improve my odds when rolling, but that just put me far behind in the points race.

You also draw cards during your turn, some of which provide immediate bonuses, and some of which can score during the end game. Again the luck of the draw can be large here, if you can draw bonus cards that work together.

It's not horrible, I want to like it more than I did. The action drafting system is excellent, I'd like to see more of that.

I think this game deserves more attention than it recieves here. Im not sure why, because this is a nice little gem. 

There is much more in this little game then what it appears and I rather enjoy the subtle depths that are exposed as we play. It is not complex, or heavy, but it is engaging and fun to play without taking up too much time. With two, it could take about an hour and a half or less.

Mecánica bastante original y muchas posibilidades estratégicas. Las cartas de privilegio (que son bonus secretos hasta el final de la partida) hacen que se mantenga la tensión hasta terminar el juego. 
En la primera partida me gustó y le había dado un 7.5 de nota, pero disfruté más la segunda al descubrir otras estrategias de juego, por lo que la subo a un 8.5.

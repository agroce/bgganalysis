A perfect, ingenious speed-deduction game. Lovely wooden pieces sit on the table. A card is drawn showing several of those pieces in a variety of colours. Players must attempt to be the first to grab the piece which is not represented on the card, either by image or by colour. It is hard to explain in writing!! Variant rules crank up the difficulty/confusion level and you can even combine the game with the equally good Ghost Blitz to make it even more difficult. The fun in the game comes from the groans of players who thought they'd made a successful grab only to be shown otherwise by the slowed players. You cannot escape making mistakes in this game - the premise is deliberately confusing - and that creates a lot of laughs.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Cool speed game... and probably my favorite of the genre, because it's super tense and chaotic. Geistesblitz is a silly fun game, but it's also actually a pretty hard mind exercise, because there's quite a few things to analyze in very few seconds. This game might not be really innovative, but it has very nice components and it does its job perfectly. It's SO fun!

Just like its older brother, Geistesblitz 2 is a perfect party game, as it plays in just a handful of minutes and blends perfectly with the former for more difficult games. [i](June 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I still enjoy the original Geistesblitz much better: thus, since one of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to keep half-point ratings to a minimum and Geistesblitz 2 isn’t one of those, I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

More of the same, which is a good thing in this case.  The Ghost Blitz series does a great job of balancing rule complexity with playability in a way that is hard to define.  This game, when coupled with Ghost Blitz, just seems to create an atmosphere that leads to lots of laughing and "I can't believe I forgot that little rule" moments that just resonates with my family.  Those looking to prove their prowess with their brain melting strategies should look elsewhere... this is a light affair for laughing, smiling, and having a great time with some acquaintances.

Great concept. Very poor implementation. The first one is much better. 2.0 provides a fun expansion when combined with the first game but it's terrible as a stand alone. The components are much more cheaply made and painted without primer so the colors don't even match the cards. Get the original Ghost Blitz!

Does not get played as often as I'd like :( so I get my fix via the app. Still a fun game but probably better as a party game with more than 2 players. Deserves its rating of 8.

This is the only speed/reaction game in my collection (well together with the original Geistesblitz it's two) and I really love it. The two sets can be combined to make a bigger and more complex game. The problem is the other half is not fond of speed games :( 

However, I will keep it because - our collection needs some diversification and this is a category that is under-represented, we don't have anything else like it, the theme is fun and cute, the components are sturdy German made toys, it plays up to 8, the rules can be explained in 2 mins, the gameplay is simple and straightforward, and that makes it perfect for playing with children, small family gatherings or evenings with friends that drop by and don't normally play games. Can see this being more fun with even more players.

This is a small, portable, zero-setup, easily-taught reaction game with great cute components.

There are a couple of keys to teaching this one (or any of the geistes blitz series):

1: Introduce the rules only gradually - don't do a big rules dump up front.  Play the most basic game until everyone can demonstrate they understand.

2: Ask better players to restrain themselves temporarily when they've taken, say, 3 in a row, until the slower players start to win some.  (For kids, I may "freeze" and "unfreeze" them myself, and challenge them to play only in their head).  

Not only is it no fun at all if you don't take any cards, it also turns the game (as more rules are added) into a confusing blur.  If other players are consistently even a single second faster than one player, that player will not only NOT take any cards, but will not make the postive mental connections to improve.  If you instead let them take their own sweet time on a couple of cards at each level of rules, and they'll quickly come up to speed.  Take the players WITH you.

3: Leave a contested card in the middle until everyone has understood what the correct play was, and why the others were wrong.

This is my favourite gateway filler for younger crowds who enjoy reaction games.  It's also still good for older players because it's not simply the fastest who wins, but the fastest correct player, and that person can be slower and collect large penalties over time from impatient whipper-snappers.  

It's very portable, working well even on a picnic rug in the park.

Cons: 
You need decent lighting to play the game (on the cards, the colours gray and blue are too close).  The wooden bathtub is also not painted the same colour as its depiction on the card and so causes confusion.  Paint the tub from your copy, or wrap it in tin-foil, for a better match with the card.

Final tip: Don't play it with drinks on the table - they'll get spilt or broken unless your group are stone-cold killers (in which case you should probably not be testing them).

Great party game. Excellent for families. Children can play just as easily (usually better) than adults. Has a few more variations that can be played than ghost blitz 1. Game play is however essentially exactly the same. Can be played in conjunction with ghost blitz 1 for all sorts of chaos. Almost everybody i have introduced to this game has gone out to buy it for themselves the next day. 
Highly recommend.

Speedy reflexes and pattern/colour recognition are the two skills that are privileged in this game. Unfortunately, since the game plays out in a series of singular events, whoever speedily grinds and grabs the fastest will almost always be the winner (of individual events, and thus the game). Not quite as intricate as Set but certainly worthwhile (potentially more so as a children's game).

My favorite dexterity game.  Very clever in that the game is designed as a race but the higher level pattern recognition skills you need to win the race often get short circuited by the more visceral reactions and emotions.  Game clearly requires skill and players can improve with incremental plays.  Can be very fun, and also very intense, though best with players of similar skill levels.

Other things I really enjoy about it:
1.  Very simple to teach (~1 min), difficult to master, especially in competitive settings
2.  Flexible in terms of required time for game play - can go anywhere from a few seconds for just a few cards to hours if people are really into it!
3.  Flexible in terms of number of people - you can play with 2 and likely beyond 8 if you can fit everyone in to grab.  You can also play in teams or have a free for all.
4.  Flexible range of ages - I've played with kids as young as 4 and all the way up to senior citizens.  The components are cute and the rules simple, allowing the game to masquerade as a children's game but the gameplay gives it much wider appeal. Great teaching tool for young kids - would also recommend it for educational purposes.
5.  Modular design allowing you to adjust difficulty level through introduce advanced rules and additional sets - I have played with all three sets together (Ghost Blitz, Ghost Blitz 2.0, and Ghost Blitz 5 to 12) and all the advanced rules, resulting in a game where you flip a card and stare at 19 objects to try to figure out what to grab or say before your opponent(s)!

I love Ghost Blitz, so I (naturally) also love this game. It is the exact same game, except it has different figures and art. As I have played a lot of Ghost Blitz, the new cards in Geistesblitz 2.0 are very welcome. I particularly want to mix the games soon. 

For now, I expect to heavily play this game in the future, I always bring it with me :D.

I have played a lot of Ghost Blitz 2.0. I already ordered the next game in the series :D. The only problem I saw with this edition is that the gray color is different in the tub cards and in the tub miniature. This leads to some confusion.

Unfortunately I think we may have played out the game already in its previous incarnations (Geistesblitz and Knapp Daneben), so I hope this will see more table time. Right now, however, we haven't yet combined this with the base game, which could either be really cool or tip the game over the top of everyone's processing capabilities. So for now I give it the same rating as its predecessors, since played with the base rules, it is the same game.

This game is unique in the sense that it's a speed game that's playable with 2 players, unlike Jungle Speed or Anomia. I feel that the original Ghost Blitz was more thematic with it's components rather than these bathroom-themed pieces. Also, it's not really different...the rules include new variants, but they could easily be played with the old game and the rest of the rules are the same.

Comment from Blitz: Easily my favorite pattern recognition game. Especially with the expansion there are so many rules/exceptions going on that even best players can and often will stumble, evening the ground for worse players. Games like SET don't have that as they are all about the recognition and thus very hardcore, making worse players feel dumb. That's not a problem here. Components are cool too and make the game accessible for children aswell. 

If you're only getting one I recommend the first one over this, as 2.0 has slightly lesser components. Best and most fun to play is to get both Blitz and Blitz 2.0 and combine them according to rules.

2-Player Comment:
* The more the merrier, but Blitz works with any player count. Evenly skilled opponent is recommended.

Oltre a dare la possibilità di giocare al classico Fantascatti, questa espansione permette di combinare le due versioni per dar vita a partite ancora più combattute e avvincenti. A discrezione dei giocatori quindi si potrà procedere con il semplice e immediato gioco apprezzato da molti ma, per i palati più fini, c'è la possibilità di inserire alcune regoline e rendere il tutto meno ripetitivo a chi ci ha già fatto diverse partite. Le ultime varianti (rana parlante e combinazione di mazzi) sono veramente impegnative. Questa versione può essere giocata anche senza il base.

I actually have had a really good time with this game so it could be rated higher, but it's a speed game which requires instant solution recognition to do well, so the fun at the table is completely dependent on whether the other players are treating the game as a fun romp with lots of laughs, or whether it's treated as a ho-hum, who cares, I hate speed games type thing. You get out of it what you put into it. As speed games go, it's nice because there's two possible ways a card could score, so if you get stuck in a rut of only looking at one way, you'll be too slow when it's the other. So your mind needs to be open to both ways at once and be fastest in each. Someone who's good at this game should stomp over others, so that's another reason it might not work well with your group. Also, I suspect adults will stomp all over children so I'm not so sure it's a game I'd play with kids. But if you can get a group of participants who like this sort of stuff, it can be good fun as a filler.

English "Ghost Blitz 2" version.  Ghost Blitz was a good game, but I don't think it needed a "sequel."  Shrug.

The same game as Ghost Blitz, although I may prefer the first version as the rub piece will wear out! Gifted once.

This game is very cool. I thought it would be good for the kids but they aren't fast enough. I think this is actually a great opening game or even a drinking game. I actually found it at a thrift store for $3.

Novos desenhos e novos objetos, num jogo igualzinho, mas que tem uma variante em que se juntam os objetos de ambas as versões de Fantasma Blitz. Estranho o formato da banheira, além de que o desenho cinzento, à semelhança do anterior, não se distingue com facilidade. Interessante para quem for louco pelo jogo, ou para quem ainda não tem o primeiro. Creio que a maior parte dos jogadores esperavam mais qualquer coisinha…

Fun real time pattern recognition game that really created so funny moments. When some one picks the wrong item even after some already picked the right one can just bring in the laughter. Not much to it but was just fun and entertaining to play.  Plays like the original but with a haunted bathroom theme.  Also has advanced variants rules which really can make this on challenging.

Fun fun fun till people are of different levels, and then it's just bad, a real blowout. BUT the mistake-means-you-lose-a-card is a great rule for making players of similar but not exact skill have tight games. Best played with lots of grabby hands, so you can have tug o wars, fake outs, and scrambles for the bits. I like shouting out the names of possible objects as we play, just to add to the excitement. GHOST! NO, COUCH! WAIT, FROG! RED FROG! GREEN FROG! PEUSE FROG!

A game of discovering the pattern in the cards, in order to grab the correct object to score a point. It is in the same vein as Bongo.

For when you want to use your dexterity in the funniest/silliest way. Although having played enough times, I have a certain advantage over those who play for the first time, so I try not to play with the first timers.

OH MY, my brain HURTS!

This is one of those speed-recognition logic-deduction games. There are 5 objects on the table: free frog, red towel, gray bathtub, blue hairbrush, and ______. Each card in the deck shows a picture of these objects and colors, in various combinations (e.g., a blue ghost and white brush). The goal is to grab the missing item, unless there's a frog in the picture -- in which case you say the name of the item. Except if a towel is in the picture, in which case you grab (or say) the item that is the color of the towel and ignore the usual rules.

Err ... or something like that, anyway. Actually, I never did get the rules into my head! Fun little game which would really benefit from repeated play! Not one I need to own, though.

[Swan Panasia 2012 edition] {Children; reaction; optimal 3-5p} It is essentially the same as Geistesblitz.  People doesn't need to have both games, but I purchased this in case I need something refreshing with my elder daughter, or as a gift to my friend.

The twists here is the "Frog".  Players need to call for a name, rather than grabbing an object when they see a frog.

Adds more twists to the original Geistesblitz, such as now calling the piece in question in a foreign language. For the first game it appeared much harder than Geistesblitz, but we adapted quite soon.

However, we have not yet tried the combined game (1.0 and 2.0).

Exactly what a light filler should be; accessible, fun, funny and easy to explain.

We played the whole way through the deck of cards in a few minutes and were all quite happy to do so again.

I'd question how replayable the game would be as once you 'know' that the carpet is red and the brush blue, the game can be played instinctively making it unfair on new players, but this is a minor quibble overall as it is just so much fun!

Logging plays under regular Ghost Blitz. This is exactly the same as the base game but with different pieces. There are also several variants in the rulebook, including some that involve using both versions of Ghost Blitz, but they seem to complicate an otherwise simple game.

Original Ghost Blitz comment:

Really fun. The Ghost Shout version is the best way to play.

Update: I've played most of the major speed games out there and for me this is still the best "flip a card, grab something" speed game. The simplicity of the game, plus that subtle twist of grab the thing pictured [i]or[/i] grab the thing that [i]isn't[/i] pictured, keeps this one fun after many plays. The additional layer of the Ghost Shout variant (if a book is in the picture, you shout the name of item instead of grabbing it) just makes it even better.

Simple perception game with a simple but great twist: sometimes you have to say the solution, sometimes you have to grab it.
Combining the base and 2.0 sets makes it hard enough for experienced players.

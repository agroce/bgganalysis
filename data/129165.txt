GAME: Wings of Glory: WW1 Duel Pack
RANK: 3144

RATING: 10
Both duel packs are great ways of getting into Wings of Glory. You get two core planes and sufficient rules, counters, and game aids to start playing within minutes of opening the package. Truly a great way to start a collection.

For those missing the old Deluxe set for WoW WWI, you can get a couple of these new Duel Packs and you're practically there. It's hard for me to let anything from this game get by me, so when aircraft start to roll out—even repeats—I'm all over them.

Batalo-ludo (kun pentritaj peonoj) simulanta duelojn de  aviadiloj dum la 1-a Mondo-milito.

Ares took the right decision to make a stand-alone game that  can be used as an affordable introduction to the bigger (and vastly more expensive) series.

Absolute re-ludebla.

This is a miniatures game I wish I could get to the table more.  It is very easy to pick up and I like that the rules ramp up in complexity, allowing newer players to come into the game with ease.

A really good introductory pack for Wings of Glory.  It gives you everything you need to play straight from the box including planes, manoeuvre decks, damage cards, counters and rules.

Duel packs are a simple way to get into the game.  They contain the standard rules (but not advanced rules, which you will eventually want ) and enough for basic fighter duels.

Good models, nicely painted and decaled. A great starter kit and introduction to the game. Models also work well with Canvas Eagles rules. If you get these you may want to check out the Wings of Glory: WW1 - Ace Cards Promo Pack in the BGG store.

I own both duel packs. Very pleased with my purchase.

I had been holding off getting this one for a while but the ‘duel pack’ format was too good to pass up. Two opposing aeroplanes (one Central Powers and one Triple Entente), rules, counters, cards, measuring sticks and other sundry stuff all for about USD$20 gives the full game in a very affordable package - just right for ‘dipping the toe’ in this system without committing too much cash up front.

Well, the good news is that I really like this one. It is a simple, fun and engaging game. The theme is well brought out and the miniatures are simply superb; a little delicate (I have to look out when my nearly three year old wants to handle them) but superb nonetheless.

I was so impressed with the first duel box that I got that I promptly ordered the other duel box as well as a collection of other aeroplanes. This game is, I think, more fun with more players - there is the capacity for some monster games with this which I find really appealing.

I have played this seven times so far and enjoyed each game. I see this as being a real ‘keeper’ and one I’ll expand with the full rule set and (way too) many little aeroplanes.

Very highly recommended to anyone looking for a simple and fun WWI dogfighting game.

UPDATE:

Check out my review on the WoG Duel pack game entry.

High quality pre assembled and pre painted minis with a quick moving strategic gameplay mechanic unique to this game. One of the best Games I have ever played. I am just rating the game as a whole, not this individual packet.

A popular little game, have played with my brother-in-law and nephew and they both enjoy it immensely (I think). Wouldn't class the former as a gamer and the latter is only starting but overall a very enjoyable experience.

We play the most basic rules.

DAKADAKADAKA!!!

This is an EXCELLENT game to play with kids in the 6-10 age range.  Well in their reach.  I'm am very much enjoying playing it with my buddies too.  Well worth the money.

Update -- After 20 games I've discovered that everybody loves playing this.  I have the models and they attract attention, and when someone comes into the game they always enjoy it.  Age of Steam players, Agricola players, Bolide players, even Scrabble players smile after a WoW dogfight.  Well worth the purchase price.

Has the advantage of being teachable in three minutes, even if you don't share a language with your student.

This is a great starting point for the first world war Wings of Glory.  I have both Duel Packs, and the only thing I could wish is that the Fokker Dr.I had been painted in the famous all-red colour scheme!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

For people who love minis. Not a good enough game to justify the expense of getting into it. I'd rather play a hex and counter WWI game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
Great fun as always, and wonderfully accessible. Even when adding in some of the optional rules, this is still a game you can teach in a few minutes.

The game really is at its best when you have a lot of players involved and a 3v3 team game was great fun.

Update: I'm loving how accessible this game is. You really can be up and running in just a few minutes.

Rating up from 7.2 to 7.4.

An excellent introduction to the game system. Everything you need to get the two included planes on the tabletop and playing. Great for those that just want to dip their toe in and explore the game before making a big investment.

Finally picked up both of these self-contained sets just to get an extra two player placeholders and "A" damage deck.  Also, the paint job on the DR.I is different than the original released version for MvR.  Good for when you want to pull out two planes quick to teach someone the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an even cheaper entry point into the "of Glory" system - two planes, some counters and the rules needed for just those two planes - and you are all set to go. Great if you want to try it out, but if you like it you will need the full rules and accessories set.

The best miniature air-battle board game. The metallic models are very good made. The card design is improved. The maps, which are selling separately, are also very well constructed. The only disadvance is that someone has to spend a lot of money in order to build a big air-fleet.

Would play again. Only tried one on one dog fight but feel like this game has great potential to be interesting.

Kickstarted.  Interesting head to head card game, with an unfortunate name.

The wax and wane of the resource (whatever it's called) is an interesting mechanic, and I'm partial to Smash Up style deck construction. (Pick two premade deck halves, combine.)

Smash Up's ner-do-well little brother? Not huge fans of Smash UP but decided to give this a try because it seemed like it might be different.  You combine two decks (just like in Smash UP and there is really the only similarity) then compete in a fight that was so dull and predictable that we put it back in the box before finishing the 1st game. And can some one please tell me why the KS edition came with stickers?

I'm a backer. It's so great to have this in my hands. My son and I loved it from our very first play. It is simple, not deep. That doesn't detract from the fun. If you are the kind of person that likes deep and complex games then it is not for you. The complexity is on par with Fluxx where there are only basic rules and everything else is on the cards (but it is not the same style of game as Fluxx).

Cool little game. It feels fairly swingy, depending on how many good cards you draw, and character balance isn't perfect. Some characters have a HUGE advantage if they draw one of their permanent cards early. But the game is quick enough that none of this matters too much. I love the adrenaline mechanic!

i think i would perhaps feel more invested in this game (and therefore a higher regard) if bought this. It was a freebee from a convention. It wasnt a game id buy on my own before hand, and it didnt change my opinion. Its an admirable attempt.

The color scheme is muted. The characters are generic, the game play fast and fairly simple to understand with a unique flowing quality between players.

Imagine elements of Small world, Smash up, and Star Realms combined into one.

I like the concept: build your deck by selecting a mini deck for a class and a race, then go head to head with your opponent.  There are so many combinations especially when you add in the expansions.  Unfortunately, this game isn't very much fun.  It's OK and pretty easy to learn, but the entire time I have played it I kept thinking about how I could be playing other, better card battling games. And the list of those games is pretty long.

This game has a different mechanic where you don't put warriors or creatures into play like most games.  You play defenses on your turn, which then become your attacks that happen during your opponents turn, and then they disappear.  It is an interesting way to have combat, but very confusing for people who are used to other games.  So I can't even recommend this as a starter game before introducing someone to MTG, Pokemon Card Game, Dominion, or Star Realms.  Smash Up is the closest game to resemble this one, and if you want that kind of game, then go play Smash Up.  I not sure what kind of gamer would really like this game, and for every different type of gamer I would recommend something else.

It is fun. It is easy enough to learn if combat based CCG's are in your wheel-house. I went all in for the Base and 2 Expansion decks. You get whag you pay for.

It seemes pricey, and it is for a card game. However, what came in the mail exceeded my conservative hopes. The KS box is amazing. The different combinations is awesome. 

It is harder than Smash Up, but I feel it adds more depth as a trade off.  To me this is Yomi, meets lite customization, and throw in rather concise rules.

Satisfaction 10/10
Gameplay is a solid 9/10

It just seems too samey.  The "different" decks aren't different enough.  In fact most are almost identical.  The game play feels unoriginal.  Production quality was great.  But if I want a 2p card game there are simply far better choices out there.

I played this for the first time a couple of days ago and it fell flat for me, too. I think Tom Vasel nailed it by saying that everything felt the same. The special abilities almost never mattered. The characters were bland. There were no game-changing combos, no dramatic swings of fortune. Nothing broken or wonky, but no reason for me to want to play it again, either.

A card battling game, where you play "hits" and "blocks" each round. you blocks stop the hits, and then are rotated to be used as hits. the game forces you to choose between drawing or gaining energy to use cards, which adds a interesting dynamic. You also "create" your deck each game by combining "moves" from races (elf, ogre. etc) and a class (warrior, monk, etc). Thus each game you have unique fighting styles and cards.

This is the go to game now for the g/f and myself. Not because I request it, but because she does. That is a feat. It plays in 15min and is easy to set up and breakdown. They need to get a Sci-Fi edition in th works.

The only issue I have with it, is the instructions are not super clear on a few parts. Like how to use the multi-block and multi-attack cards. Also card drawing is not clear. Is it any aggression card or do you stack the aggression cards and pull from the top.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great filler and/or pub game. Discovering the race + class combos you enjoy as well as the attack + defense combos that go along with them make the game highly replayable. It will be fun to see what expansions have to offer.

RATING: 6.5
Very easy card game, similar to smash up in a sense but also has elements of Magic involved

The game can be very luck driven provided you draw the right cards at the right time, but otherwise it can be quite tactical in knowing when to strike hard and when to just build aggression and defend

Pros:
- Kickstarter box is BOSS!!
- Really fast to learn
- Really fast to set up
- Interesting combos to set up

Cautions:
The structure of the game is such that players have to be cautious of how they cycle their cards.  Since a player's draw pile is their move energy, it's imperative to have a pattern where the player adds cards to the top and remove (or draw) cards from the bottom of that energy stack (for example).  I've found that if I don't do this (and instead add and remove only from the top of the pile for example), my high powered moves could end up forever stuck in that pile and I could get knocked out because of that.

I backed this game because I thought the idea was cool, but didn't expect the gameplay to be all that great. I am happy to report that it actually feels pretty fresh and inventive. I love that your blocks turn right around and become attacks. It makes for a great back and forth that doesn't just feel like a "Take That" sort of game. The Aggression system makes for some fairly interesting decision making as well. Also surprisingly fun for more than 2 players!

This game is fast paced, has great flavor, and a lot of replay-ability. The aggression stack mechanic means you have to constantly be keeping your 'resources' in check, as well as your opponents.

There are so many combinations of class and race, I just can't get enough of it.

I backed this when the Kickstarter was on, and I don't regret it. We think of this a MtG boiled down to it's core (kill the other guy) and on speed. Way less resource management but just enough to be tricky. Practically no ability-wrangling, quick play, excitement and usually winners made in the last round or two.
Last game we played was a 1v1v1 which ended with one player dying in one turn and then the winner killing the remaining opponent in the next turn with 1 health left himself. THAT's close.

Only drawback: 2v2 games tend to drag out forever, with both teams just building and building walls of moves (that's what the "monsters" are called) back and forth. We played 3 of those games so far and all lasted for well over 90 minutes, 2 of them over two hours.

All in all a nice game to break up our usual routine, plus it works really well in 2 or 3 players as well.

Played the print n play. This game doesn't get me. It seemed more tactical than strategic. Most of the game is a slog between cards with an occasional special card you hope you have enough points to play. I found it tedious with moments of an interesting card draw. I don't think I'm the target audience for this one. Some may like it though.

The field for two-player combat sims is huge, even if you just limit it to card games.  There's MTG, Yomi, JAB (realtime boxing!), Flash Duel, Star Realms,  Star Wars: Clash of the Lightsabers, Shazamm!, etc.

Epic PVP isn't without its merits - the multi-purpose aggression/card pool presents interesting decisions, for instance - but the games listed above (and others) are all better.  So unless your buddy is paying you to play, there are better things to do with your goblin and ranger time.

I got a chance to playtest this with the Fun to 11 team tonight with my two boys (ages 11 and 13). I can say that having more decks beyond the print and play definitely made this a lot more fun. 

The decks play VERY differently - and it was fun seeing synergies and combos possible with different deck combinations. 

My boys are rather seasoned gamers for their ages. They aren't easily impressed by a game -but when we left tonight their only complaint was that we couldn't take a full copy of the game home with us.

This is going to be a solid staple in my collection. Good balance of luck and strategy. The art is fun and it has some mechanics that I have not yet seen in other games. 

Looking forward to trying more deck combos!

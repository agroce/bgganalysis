A pleasant enough building game.  Interesting separation between draft and build phases.  Some neat ideas here with pressing your luck on the build order.  If you have a good memory, you will crush your opponents, though.  Nice short playing time.

Heel licht spel.  Een monument nabouwen, met de juiste kleuren blokjes in de juiste volgorde.  Je zit te klooien met het leggen van de blokjes... is niet duidelijk.
Veel geluk, want je weet niet wat de andere spelers eerst gaan leggen en je kan er nauwelijks op anticiperen.
Ik wil het nog één keer proberen, maar dat is het dan ook.

Played at Essen 2016.

We were in a rather casual mood when we played this. It was a quick fun game with some light decisions. I guess you could play this with more strategy if you memorized all the stones the other players took, but this is not my style of play. (I'm not really good at trick taking games for the same reason.) 

Nice components, although a few stones were shorter than others. A bit of variety with the different buildings.

This game is all about turn order -- so much is dependent on having the ability to play and making sure your play does not set up the next player for more points than you received.

This is problematic for two players, where the starting player can be extremely penalised for going first. If the first two levels stack directly, then the first player plays and scores one point, then the other player builds on top and scores three, and the starting player is right back in the same position again. It doesn't seem like a design intent for players to want to do everything possible to [i]avoid[/i] taking a block (the black block for start player) but that's how the two player game can play out. Some boards are worse than others, but I still am confident not recommending it for the two-player game.

But it works well with three. Turn order is definitely important, perhaps the most important part of the game, but it's a bit more spread out as to who benefits and who's behind the eight-ball. I haven't played with four but I suspect it will be similar but with players' luck more dependent on what blocks they're able to play. I think three is probably the sweet spot.

A bit annoying to place blocks. The staggering on some levels encourages people to build haphazardly or along the edges, so others don't directly benefit from adjacent plays, but then it's difficult to fill in the gaps later.

As a positive, I think it does a good job of offering highs and lows, which many light German-style games fail to do. A game's biggest sin in my eyes is to pray at the altar of The Almighty Balance, and to not offer players the chance to make bad and good plays. In this game, you feel good when another player sets up a play for you to score a lot, and you feel bad when you do it for someone else. The drama in World Monuments is in a sweet spot for me, not too much for a family game but enough to make the game a little exciting and tense.

Played this with four players. The basic idea is simple. You gather building materials, store them out of sight and after that try to use the materials to contribute to a cooperate building project (The world monuments from the game's title). The building plan and the scoring per material placement require you to time your steps, somewhat like the four-in-a-row game.

But what could have been a simple and elegant game is hampered by not having much control. The gathering/delving part of the game leaves you little influence on what to get and the timing during the building phase is hard to get right with four players, because your opponents are likely to do unpurposely unexpected moves.

I'm clearly not the intended audience. It's a family game, I get that, but I have seen better.

At least it was over quickly.

For starters, I purchased this game specifically because it was the highest rated game by a designer with the same initials as me... Hey, I needed it for a challenge on BGG, don't judge me! Because of that I wasn't expecting much from World Monuments. I was pleasantly surprised, there isn't anything mind blowing about this game but the group did enjoy the experience. While it probably won't make it into next weeks game bag its one I would play again.

RATING: 6
World Monuments is a simple board game. It's not a great game but also not bad for some light play. I rather enjoyed the building aspect, but my husband found it somewhat boring. If you are looking for a light filler or an easier game for younger players, World Monuments may appeal to you.

RATING: 8
Initial rating of 8.  May be a little high.  After a few more plays may go down to 7.

What I like:

The completely unique concept of building something together with blocks.  

There is forward-thinking strategies you must employ to win.

What I disliked:

A certain level of determinism that you cannot overcome.  For example, as you start running the mental math, you realize that no matter what you do, you cannot place certain blocks before another person.  And the only way to compensate for it would be an impossible level of forecasting. 

Overall, I liked it.  If  there is little room in influencing your long term goal through strategy, then I may have to move it down to a 7.

Note:  There are more blocks that will be played. There is a balance of picking up 3-point blue blocks along the way.  What good is a point-less block at the end, which nearly every player will have anyway?  The players with heavier blue blocks took a noticeable lead at the end.

Nagyon tetszik az alapötlet és a megvalósítás is. Az külön hangulatos, hogy minden játékban más és más épületeket építhetünk, ami kis fantáziával még tovább bővíthető. A játékmenetet azonban nagyon családinak éreztem. Pikk-pakk lemegy a játék, ami jó, a szabályok is nagyon egyszerűek, de nagyon nehezen kalkulálható hogy mi fog történni, és mit érdemes vinni bányászós fázisban. Családinak szerintem ajánlott, gémerként még könnyed levezetésnek se annyira.

Game looks like a good fit for my family but the Kickstarter was an absolutely terrible value proposition, so I passed.

Base game (4 monument boards) + 4 KS "exclusive" monument boards at 50$ early bird + 10$ shipping does not appeal. At least some others agreed as campaign lost backers and value much of the last week.

An expansion pack of a few more monument boards and some blocks was priced at 35$ ?!

I am writing this comment to remind myself to look for this cheap at some point after it is out in general distribution.

Not really a game for two players. Just wasn't fun because heavily stacked against the first player. Haven't played with more than that. Maybe it would work better for 3-4 players looking for a light-weight game, but we have other games in that category that are more fun and engaging. On the plus side, the components are really nice, and it's interesting seeing the pieces fit together to build the monuments.

Good family game. It was a little too much for the 7 yr olds, but the 10 yr old girls really enjoyed this. 

Some nice strategy in selecting pieces, and building the building is fun...BUT it doesn't stay together really well, especially if you have some young, clumsy hands adding to it. 

Overall, I'd recommend it for 8 and up (or mellow 7 yr olds and up)

Nekem nagyon tetszett, de sajnos Anettnek nem annyira. Végletesen egyszerű szabályokkal és nagyon rövid játékidővel bír a WM, ezek mind pozitívumok. Ahogyan az is, hogy együtt építünk, figyelnünk kell, milyen anyagokat milyen sorrendben szerzünk be az épülethez, és fontos, hogy az előttünk lévők milyen lehetőségeket hagynak nekünk, mi mit hagyunk nekik. Ide tényleg kell a paraván! :)
Egyetlen negatívum, hogy kicsit talán kevés az a négy épület, ami a dobozban van.

Really fun 'brick' drafting and 3D building game. This is a light Euro that anyone can play and it plays really quickly too. 

Unfortunately, the base game only comes with 4 maps, which may get stale after repeated plays and the extra maps and promos released for the game are incredibly difficult to find.

RATING: 7.2
Light but with nice elements of strategy. It's pleasing to build the monuments, but it can be a little fiddly to slide the bricks in at times without disturbing the pieces that have already been built. I'm very tempted to dig out a bunch of Lego bricks to replace the wooden brick provided - I think the square bricks with 4 pips on top will be just the right size.

This game is ok. The block gathering and building is interesting and sets this game apart.  Unfortunately, there are only 4 monument options and I feel like with so few boards they should have made indents for the foot print of the buildings to make play easier.  Some information or educational value about the monuments would have been nice.  Game art is ok but doesn’t really wow you.  I will definitely keep and play this game because it is an interesting variance and works well for a variety of ages, but I wouldn’t say I was wowed

I have had a soft spot in the past for Queen Games, and I have backed a lot of their projects (esp. the 'Big Box' editions) on KS. I've decided tho' that this will be the last Queen project I back on KS. I entirely understand that new game creators find their publication timetables to be unrealistic, but it is inexcusable for a well-established game company like Queen to so often be many months behind schedule. This game, to be fair, was not far behind schedule but it was insulting to find that Queen have treated EU and UK backers as second-class citizens - offering a freebie to US backers to 'compensate' for the game being sold at GenCon before it went to backers, but ignoring requests from EU backers for similar treatment. I also found Queen unresponsive when I contacted them about a game box arriving damaged.

First impression of this game is that it is okay, and not really excited about it.  That written, my son (10) loved the game.  He really liked the building and the strategy aspect of the game.  Though basic strategy for me as an adult, I was thrilled to see him calculate how the pieces he collected or placed would affect me, and set up his future turn.  I look forward to trying this with more people, and I am positive I will be playing this often with my children.

The concept of the game is to quarry blocks and then collectively build monuments to score points.  This is a good concept but unfortunately for me the game fell a little flat as there seems to be a clear advantage to the start player in a three player game. The start player will always be able to get the start player block back again.  We played two games and the first player ran away with it both time because they just position the quarry pawn away from from the start marker and always had first choice on the monument.  The game really feels like if plays itself as there are a lot of really interesting choice because the monument are very bland.  the only interesting one is the Capital building because there are different colors in different layer.  This added a second layer to the game that it greatly needs.    Additionally, it needs a lot more maps because there is not a lot of replay ability with only four.  It feels same-y each game.  Disappointing that this on just feel flat for me.

Perfectly pleasant gateway-level game, a beautiful job on the production. Absolutely safe to get this out with a non-gaming crowd, if that ever comes up in your life, and show them something "Instead Of Monopoly."
For experienced gamers, this will need some house-ruling to capture interest. Certainly do away with the family-friendly screens, so that you can see what our opponents have, and what you can take to hose them (and keep from getting hosed yourself).
Even with that, this won't ever lift beyond a very light family game.

Game in which players collect different colored bricks to build 4 different buildings of the world. Blends resource management, worker placement and building/area control...yet it's very easy to understand. There is a significant amount of strategy involved when choosing the bricks and when to lay them for points. A light strategy game that would be excellent for a gateway game, or for a decent filler...could use more building boards though.

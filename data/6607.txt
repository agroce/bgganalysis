Munchkin Fu: Guest Artist Edition - Signed by Steve Jackson

RATING: 2
Light, simplistic, funny game that has an interesting theme (the only "Munchkin" series game worth getting in my opinion, due to theme and card variety).  Can quickly get repetitive, goes on a bit long, and lots of luck involved.

Own the [boardgame=14087]Monky Business[/boardgame] expansion, which is worth it if you think this game is worth playing at all.

The same old munchkin game with characters of Hong Kong movie styles.

Good points: You will like it if you enjoyed the original game with more cheesy pictures.

Bad points: Shall not waste money on this game if you have the original title.

I only played Munchkin Fu once at the end of a late gaming night and I couldn't get into it. I especially had trouble figuring out what all the cards did. 

For some reason, I could never remember that the Yakuza class is able to pick up an extra alley card after a monster kill. Also, both the alley and treasures cards are white, which can be somewhat confusing (albeit, the treasure cards have a red border). Overall, the Munchkin Fu cards are not as easy-to-read/understand or attractive as the original Munchin cards. 

I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but the original Munchkin game is more intuitive. For example, the backstab ability of the thief is easy to recall. And Kovalic's artwork is outstanding.

Since the one game I played was also very one-sided (I couldn't get any useful cards) and I was a bit too tired to really get into the game, I'll have to try this again.

Actually, I bought this game for my sister.

My choice of party game when you have crowd that is into RPGs, anime and other geeky stuff. Played it with 3 and up to 8 players. RPG feel of game is what i like about this one. Munchkin FU was edition i have because i used to play with people who where into anime.  Droping in ratings in my eyes, there are better games around this days that give better felling then this one. Will hold on to copy for sentimetal reasons.

Was pretty excited to get a second Munchkin game, finding the first one interesting after two or three plays. So far this has been played once by itself and once in a mixed game with Munchkin 1 + 2 and Super Munchkin. Didn't really care for the mixed game but thought the balance was interesting in Munchkin Fu itself, it's behavior concerning bonus strengths behaving far more erratically than the first game.

We've had amazing success with this as an introduction to "Screw your neighbour" type of games.  One Christmas we had shot-glasses thrown over this game!  Loud, boisterous, hilarious!

Ugh really?  I am waiting for Munchkin Flux so I can Die the most painful death imaginable!!!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

The kung fu, samurai and anime jokes are fun for a little while, but like the whole Munchkin franchise, it tends to get boring, repetitive and pretty stupid about halfway through the game. Of course, the game will continue on and on after that point. This is a problem with the Munchkin series in general.
An embarrassingly casual game, but if you want a minor to moderate chuckle and enjoy the other Munchkin games you might enjoy this.

Bought this after owning Munchkin. It's fun, but not nearly as good as Munchkin for some unknown reason. It may be partially something subtle, like the theme or the art, but I think the game is less interactive. It's a lot harder to hold your opponents back, so it turns into a straightforward race to level 10.

RATING: 5
(As of [b]?[/b] plays) I used to be enamoured of the Munchkin series, which was partially responsible for bringing me to BGG, but it is certainly a game where familiarity can breed contempt. The humour is great, the artwork is perfect, and the concept of reducing the role-playing experience to its shallowest component elements is fun. The fatal flaw is the directionless randomness and the tortuously prolonged time it takes to finish a game.

[b]5 year verdict:[/b] Munchkin was one of the first non-traditional games I bought, and I played a lot of it early on, but I have definitely moved on.

Sorry, but this gets the [i]actual[/i] rating for all [i]Munchkin[/i] games.  "Munchkin" [i]Munchkin[/i] works because the theme and gameplay are organically intertwined in a perfectly appropriate dance of mechanic and experience.  It models the fantasy RPG gone wrong brilliantly.

Hee-ya! Munchkin roundhouse kicks its way out of the dungeon and into the dojo with this set of cards that bases all of its jokes on the martial arts film genre. There are some chuckles here, but the transfer loses something.

Turtle Fu!  Clown Fu!  Toe Fu!  All the fun of a Martial Arts RPG without the role-playing.  Of course, role-playing is the primary point of RPGs.

A fun chaotic beer and prezel game, sure. Not the greatest games of all times, but an almost constant end of the evening game for my playing group. At frist you laugh about the images, later you start to laugh about some fun tactics and insder jokes of you playing group. Thus I disagree that it gets old very fast.

RATING: 6
It's almost like the original mMnchkin, but it seems more balanced. Moreover, I love everything that has to do with samurais, so that gives this a plus. Not innovative nor anything, but overall it's OK.

That said, if you're interested in a Munchkin, pick the one whose theme resonates better with your game group, because if you're playing Munchkin seeking a balanced game, you're doing it wrong.

RATING: 8
Fu-You! Plenty of great martial arts and Asian movie themed references (Geisha, hilariously named fighting styles, bad movie effects.) I find this is a little more slap-stick good fun than many of the Munchkin editions. It's my favourite. (Unless they make a Firefly Munchkin someday.)

RATING: 6
After the fantastic fun of vanilla Munchkin, this was actually a bit of a let-down.

The new game-mechanics (like Styles) work well enough. It seems to me that the humour just doesn't have the same "snap". Granted, it may be that I just don't find the Yakuza/Ninja/Samurai theme as whacky and zany as I thought I would.

I haven't tried any of the other expansions though, so I don't know how this stacks up against those.

RATING: 5
Funnier for me than regular munchkin because I'm an Asian movie fan, this game basically boils down to grunging for levels and picking on your buddies.

RATING: 6
Our trio of Munchkin, Munchkin Fu, & Star Munchkin have each seen about an equal share of game time (which is a *lot* for each)... unfortunately since the gameplay is the same between them all that means the burnout factor has added up quicker. Making a concerted effort to play less Munchkin for the time being...

The other Munkin game I aquired when I was in my Munchkin phase. Picked it out due to my love of martial art movies and interest in the oriental theme.

Also have the expansion and was not disappointed with the change over from standard munchkin - tend to be more enjoyable for non gamers with the cards being listed as Class and Style (instead of race) compared to their confusion between races and classes with the classic.

RATING: 5
The standard Munchkin game play typically involves a slow progression to lvl 7 or 8 then a frantic scramble by all players to stuff the leader, with the 2nd or third player then swooping in for the victory.  The game play is very luck driven, isn't particularly interesting, and the social element quickly follows a similar pattern.  It also runs too long for what it is.

With that said, in the right circumstances and with the right people, Munchkin can provide some light entertainment.  Serious gamers are not the target market - teenagers, non gamers, or drinking buddies may be.  

As for Munchkin Fu versus other versions, I found the cards harder to read than in Pirate Munchkin or Base Munchkin.  

Occasional epically furious action - much like a HK action movie.   Usually this was where the monster drawn had really bad stuff happen as a result of losing, one player would help out and the others would pile in to try and balance the odds.

I recommend only buying this version if you are a martial arts fan.  Otherwise I'd stick to regular Munchkin.

RATING: 2
Could a game be worse than Munchkin? Apparently so.
Just as annoying as Munchkin with cards that are much harder to read - thereby leading to EVEN MORE downtime as people take EVEN LONGER to read all of their cards every turn.

Always a favorite between my friends and myself.  Munchkin is a great card game that's not overly collectable like a TCG, but updates itself often enough to stay fresh.

This version of Munchkin is stand-alone from the base game but can be combined with it (or any of the other Munchkin sets).  Same humor as the original (but no the same artist).  The humor in this version is a bit more adult oriented than in previous versions so this one may not be best for kids (like the others).

KUNG FU SILLINESS - BEST PLAYED WITH THE KIDS
I know the Munchkin series is a whipping boy in these parts but seeing as how I'm a huge HK film fan I couldn't resist picking this up.  Initial (2 plays) impression:  great theme, fun in-jokes, so-so play.  Third play, this time with 4 players (prior plays with 3) - definitely plays better with 4 - increased rating to a 6 (from 5).  My youngest boy (now 8) LOVES it.  My daughter (13) really enjoyed it too (I was surprised).

Another Munchkin version I bought after one or two times of playing it (see my Munchkin rating). Suffers the same problems but increases them even more.

For itself it is balanced better than the base game it seems to me.

Yet another Munchkin. There are some solid jokes in this version, but the gameplay is still horrible.

I gave this to Terri for Christmas 04.  More munchkin is good.  Still don't think it fits as well outside the dungeon theme, but I still like it.

Without the expansion this makes the most solid of the Munchkin games with a few finite game ends.

Munchkin vacillates between a 4 and 6 for me.  If it hasn't been played in a while, busting it out can be quite  fun - repeated plays can get dull very quick.

Fun party game.  I prefer the original, though.

I bought this installment of the Munchkin game upon first sight.  I love action/adventure movies as well as martial art movies--so finally there was an addition of Munchkin that was based on stuff I easily understood.  I recommend this Munchkin for play with people who are not DDers.  It's easier to understand and play.

This was my first foray into Munchkinland.  It is still one of my favorites.  The theme is great, the art is great and the game play is, well, Munchkinly ;)

2005 printing.  Complete and in like-new condition - the cards are pristine.  The box is excellent too.

Out of the Munchkin series so far this is my favorite one. Its so over the top generousity of treasures and levels up for such low level monsters. (not to ment ion the bad stuff can be VERY bad too). Added also are styles which makes it more fun.

I think this one is the best of the series. More balanced than Muchkin, funnier than Space Muchkin.

Once upon a time I Loved the Munchkin universe. Now - not so much.

Update 2013:
Just played the original with my mates (several years since our last play). It was great fun. The game still has its flaws, but it has its moments. Plays well once a year.

Update 2014 (rating lowered):
After getting Cutthroat Caverns I probably won´t play Munchkin any more.

This is what the first expansion should have been!  It has the same "fun" of the original Munchkin, with a cheesy Hong-Kong-action-flick twist.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Interesting filler with some cool artwork (and hidden jokes), but not sure how much left fun is left in the box.  Wouldn't mind trying a few more times, but this one won't probably stick around in my collection long.  A fine game, and I wouldn't mind playing it from time to time, but didn't really do much for me.

In Game of Trains, each player is in charge for his line of trains. At the beginning of the game, the train cars in the player's train line — each with their own number — are sorted in descending order. The aim of the game is to be the first one to rearrange your train line so that the cards are in ascending order. Each card has a train car with a number and also a special power depicted on it.

Simple and super fun time killer. Rearrange your cards from descending to ascending order using a combination of card draws and special card powers. On your turn either select a card from the table for its special power or draw from the deck and add it to your line of railcars. The card it replaces goes out on the table available for use as a special power such as destroy the first card in the line, swap cards etc. The twist is that special powers affect all players so you have to keep an eye out so that you don't unwittingly hand them the game! 2 of the same special power cards cancel each other out and are discarded. A very cute little puzzle.

Has fun artwork referencing Game of Thrones and 80s TV series such as the BA Baracus van, K.I.T.T etc. and loads of airplanes. Compact Abacus Spiele box so it's perfect for travel. Quick and mindless to play. Although saying that, it's fun to try and figure out how to get those cards all in a line without losing to the use of special powers. Good for a coffee shop or waiting on people/transport etc., when you don't want to do too much thinking, or want to wake your brain up for games. Plays great with 2! Very simple though so wouldn't overuse it by playing it [i]all[/i] the time otherwise it would probably get stale. A little bit addictive and a nice diversion on occasion.

Érdekes, pofonegyszerű alapötlet, szép, jópofa kivitelezés. Arra nem sikerült rájönnöm, hogy mi lehet a jó stratégia benne, jó eséllyel nagy adag szerencse is kell, de biztos lehet valamit okoskodni. Nagy a szórakoztatási faktor is, többet talán nem is kell elvárni egy 30 perces, egyszerű kártyajátéktól.

An Essen 15 purchase. Its an ok card game redeemed by really nice art. I would not play with gamers, but as something light for a family distraction, its ok.

RATING: 4
An abstract card game where you are trying to reorganize your trains (cards) from descending order to ascending order. You either draw a card and put it down on your train or you take a power from the discard from previously discarded trains

Some take that but it was light in our game since that move doesn't advance your position.

Definitely boring and not much here. I don't really see anything that interests me

„Könnyed vagonrendezés”
A magyar nyelven megjelent kártyajáték előnye, hogy gyorsan elmagyarázható és rövid játékidejű, ami ideálissá teheti hosszabb játékok közötti szünet(ek)ben, vagy otthon családi körben több parti lejátszására.
A dolgunk egyszerű, mozdonyunkhoz csatlakoztatott 7 vagonunkat kell rendezni. Minden kocsi számmal ellátott egészen 1-től 84-ig. A cél, hogy mozdonyunktól emelkedő sorrendbe állítsuk be ezeket. A játék kezdetén 7 véletlenszerűen kapott mozdonyunkat pont ellenkezőleg, a legmagasabb számmal rendelkezővel kezdve helyezzük le mozdonyunk után. A játék során vagy lapokat húzunk fel és cseréljük ki egy már meglévő vagonunkat; vagy a középre lehelyezett vagonkártyákon található képességeket aktiváljuk, így rendezve a kocsikat, vagy zavarva, akadályozva ellenfeleinket (a képességek egy része csak saját kártyáinkra hat, mások mindenkire).
A grafika hangulatos, a lapok minősége jó, kis dobozában minden elfér, sőt még angol szabály is van a magyar szabály hátoldalán (a lapokon pedig egyetlen „bötű” sincs, így külföldi barátokkal is játszható).
Ebben a kategóriában több játékot ismerek és ez éppen a közepes kategória. Nem rossz, de sok újat sem tud mutatni a tapasztaltabb játékosoknak. Akinek bejön a vonatos téma, tegyen vele próbát, egynek jó.

Only played this once, waiting for the chef to prepare our Thai carry-out. Fairly unlikely to play it again except while waiting for a plane. Its main convenience is that the box, for once, exactly contains the game, and is little bigger than an external hard drive. The game consists of using card draws to race to sort an ordinal sequence from small-to-large to large-to-small, most of the moves being simple exchanges of neighbouring cards. Probably gets better as you get better at it.

RATING: 7
Kimondottan hangulatos, élvezetes kártyajáték. Főleg ahhoz képest, hogy alapvetően csak annyi a feladatunk, hogy a 7 csökkenő sorrendű számozott kártyánkból növekvő sorrendű legyen. :D
Mégis, bármennyire is tematikátlan ez a vonatosdi, a rajzok különleges hangulatot kölcsönöznek neki, és bár elsőre azt hiszi az ember, hogy ez így nagyon pasziánsz jellegű lesz, muszáj figyelni az ellenfeleket, és van is mód elrontani a mókájukat, ha nagyon jól állnának. Persze visszafelé is elsülhet, mert nincs mit szépíteni, jó nagy adag szerencse kell a győzelemhez. Egy 10-20 perces mókától ez azért elnézhető. :)

This is actually quite close to Completto, but here you'll find pasted on theme and six different special actions. Completto is totally abstract, a bit simplier get into it BUT far more fun.

It's a very cool card game were at the start of the game you order the cards after the Locomotive in descending order, they have numbers, and the object of the game is to have the cards after you locomotive in Ascending order... 
On your turn you can draw a card from the deck and place it anywhere on you locomotive by replacing the card in that place and that card goes to the middle of the table, or you can pick up one of the cards in the middle of the table use is special power and discard that card... the special powers allow you to move cards in you train, to remove cards from everyone's train and get a new one from the deck, swap card positions on your train, etc...
It's a very cool looking game with neat mechanics and cheap

Game of Trains is a fine game, it does a good job, but it's not enough to keep it in my collection. You use your turn to try and rearrange your numbered carriages into the correct order, randomly by drawing from the deck or by using powers from the carriages left in the middle. There is some strategy to this, but with all the competition it is just to difficult to get to the table.

Gioco di carte molto light, due regole niente di innovativo ma gioco che fila via liscio come un treno. La pesca delle carte e il caso la fanno da padrone ma il giochino fila via liscio che è un piacere. Nessuna pretesa per un giochino che si lascia giocare. In maniera ruffiana strizza l'occhio ai grandi classici della televisione, tutte le carte, differenti tra loro, hanno infatti sempre un riferimento a telefilm, film e tanto altro ancora.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I took a flier on this game because I love the artwork. The game play is Racko (getting numbers in a sequence) with some special powers thrown in. There is some added player interaction as you can cause everyone to have to discard cards from their train and possibly derail their chance to win. Game of Trains is feather light, but there is just enough there to make this a really fun filler with amazing artwork. I'd recommend it if you enjoy light, card game fillers. Game of Trains also plays great with two which is a huge + for me.[/i]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It sits quite nicely in the opener/closer niche. Easy rules, simple game-play, quick turns, the right level of messing with the other players' tableaus as a by-product of helping yourself. You start with your numbered cards in descending order, and your aim is to be the first to get them into ascending order. A turn is either to draw a card and replace a card in your tableau with it (a la the 10 Days games) or use a manipulation power to move things around. The neat aspect is that when you draw a card, the card you replace provides a power to the next player, and you need to be mindful of what powers they'd like to use, so it adds a layer of unexpected decision making in what is otherwise froth and bubble. The winning is over-dominated by luck, and there's not too much cleverness, but that's ok in a 15 min game if the process is a bit of fun, and it is.

Game of Trains reminds me very much of the 10 Days in… games, but in a smaller package and with a few extra twists. I really like the game overall and had a lot of fun playing it. The rules are easy to teach and understand, turns happen quickly, and the balance of strategy, luck, and chaos is feels about right for a short, light game such as this. The pop culture references on the cards are fun without being distracting and add to the overall casual atmosphere of the game. Game of Trains is a good game and great option for casual or family gaming as well. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if it showed up on the shelves at Target some day...

A nice little card placement/hand management game.  Each player's train is comprised of a locomotive card and 7 carriage cards.  The carriage cards have numbers on them, and you must rearrange your train so that the carriages are in ascending order (rather than descending order, which is how they start).  The carriage cards also have an action icon on them.  So each turn you can choose to pick up a card from the (hidden) draw pile, or pick up a face-up card and apply the action.  And that's all you do.

Have only played with two players, and that was relaxing fun that we both enjoyed.  You can use some strategy, but there's significant randomness in the card draws, and the other players' actions can mess your plans up.  With 3 or 4 it would be more frantic and unpredictable, which some gamers will like more.

Very small, nicely produced game with great artwork - the carriages' loads and markings are themed from Game of Thrones references, movies (Ghostbusters ECTO-1)  and 1970s television series (A-Team van, cars from Knight Rider, Dukes of Hazzard etc).

A good little filler between bigger games, or quick game for a few plays ("best of 3?").  Fun, but not too taxing.

[Brain Games 15 Edition] {Train; take-that; optimal 4p} Game of Trains is a good filler.  Players aims to re-order their line of display (rail cars) in ascending order (which is nearly descending at game start).

This game can be play in multi-solitaire way, if players totally ignore what other players are doing.  Or, it can have certain take-that you can screw the display of opponents by removing their cards.

The decision is simple in this game - tried to optimise the move to reorder your display.  Yet, players can try to manipulate the replaced cards to alter the available actions.  However, this may not be easy in most cases.  The easiest may be to discard certain action.

It's easy to teach and learn this game.  There are only 3 types of action cards (total 8 kinds of actions); so it's easy to remember.  It's easy to set up.  It is also easy to visualise.  Minor card-counting would be needed.

The card illustration is good.  I like many different rail cars on the cards, rather than the same one for all cards.

A good, simple, and quick game to play with 2-4 players. The instructions were not immediately obvious, but a quick look at a video found at the publisher site was very helpful to clear up the confusion.

Intensely thinky card game which is deeper than it looks and becomes more so with more plays.

Much trickier brain burner than it first seems. A heavier version of Dastardly Dirigibles.

Great graphics. Very bad game.
Rating after one 4 player game.

I don't know whether the game terminates at some point. The 'remove wagons from all players' cards just mess with the order. There was never any 'lock' card available for a player who could use it (action grabbed by other players, and card discarded after moving the wagon).

In addition, in a 4 player game, it is possible that one player *never* has an action card available, and just has to draw and replace from the stack each turn. Not just theorectically - it happened in our game. 

Maybe playable with 3. Don't try it with 4.

This a very fun game. It's like Racko but way better. The art work is fantastic. Easy to learn and quick to play. We played 3 games in 30 minutes. Buy this if you like card games.

A good little card game that we enjoy with my wife. Easy to learn and play but with a lot of tension, because the card you "throw away" can be used by the other player.
One more game made for travelers.

This worked well as a present for a friend of mine who works as a locomotive driver. You rearrange your train cars from descending to ascending order. This may sound simple but the game can get quite tactical. Every time you replace one car with a randomly drawn car from the pile, the replaced cars' special ability can be used by any player. So one decision to make is what special ability you want to set free.

The game is just made of cards in a very small box, but uses great artwork in a steampunk style. Especially the locomotives are very detailed and work well as a decoration element in your cupboard. The theme seems a bit tacked on becuase you basically just rearrange numbered cards. The cars themselves are quite funny. If you like this kind of artwork you may give it a try. It is a beautiful little filler game.

Aránylag rövid kártyajáték, mely elég pörgős ahhoz, h fillerként és partijátékként is definiáljuk. A vonatok sorba rakása és a kártyahúzások miatti izgalom sok kellemes percet tartogat, ráadásul magyarul is megjelent jó áron.

Acquistato 22/07/17 da Camelot durante una passeggiata del sabato, mi ha attratto qualche recensione. Lo provo da me per poi proporlo come Filler essendo fra altro portatile. Alle prossime per eventuali partite e voto.

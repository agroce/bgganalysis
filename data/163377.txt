RATING: 5
You could call this a stupid little game. I, however, enjoyed this puzzle like dice rolling quite a bit. It was fun trying to figure out the best way to assign numbers onto the map without locking yourself out.

Due to the puzzle like nature of the game, I can see that the Rolling Japan will not have too long of a lifespan. You will eventually find your standard solution to the puzzle. Then it is just a matter of dice rolls whether your solution works out or not Of course you have to adapt to the situation but essentially every game is a similar kind of a experience.

A very tight game with agonizing choices.  The dice are brutal and the decisions are all interesting.  I love the scoring, the game length, and the box size!  My only complaint is that I won't be able to make this a "dry-erase" game all that easily with such tiny boxes.

1st play: We played this on a really difficult layout, and there really wasn't much interaction.  I'm not sure any of the decisions we made were really decisions, as almost all of us were within 1 point of each other.  I don't really need to play it again, but I wouldn't be mad if I were pushed into it.

RATING: 6
A puzzle in which, with a little familiarity, optimal play is not difficult to calculate. Then it comes down to the luck of the dice. Nonetheless, I find the game tolerable because it's quick as a flash and because the dice do generate a nice degree of tension.

Not sure how much there is here to keep things interesting.  There are some choices on where to write in your #'s, but without additional maps this seems like it would get stale fast.  Reminds me of Qwixx, and at this point I have found Qwixx to be much more interesting.

RATING: 6
A good entry in the multiplayer solitaire puzzle genre. Dice are rolled, and everyone must fit the numbers rolled onto cells on their own personal player sheets, following some simple rules. If you can't place a number rolled, you have to put an X in a space. Least number of X's wins.

Overall, really simple, but fun to start or cap a night of gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is basically a solitary puzzle played out simultaneously. It is also somewhat similar to other dice games I've played recently, such as Qwixx. Players roll colored dice and then fill the numbers into correspondingly colored districts in a map of Japan. A number can only be entered if all adjacent numbers are within 1 of that number (e.g., a 3 can only be adjacent to 2s, 3s, and 4s). If you can't legally place a number, you have to mark a district with an X. Fewest Xs at the end of the game wins. 

The game is simple and luck-dependent, but it may have been the best game we played in terms of accomplishing what it set out to do. The decisions are non-trivial and become increasingly challenging as the game nears its conclusion. The game also does not outstay its welcome. I'd be happy to play again anytime.

A simultaneous puzzle game, so no interaction whatsoever. That said, it is a very fun puzzle and requires some subtly difficult placement decisions. It is over quickly and is fun to see how other players attacked the placements. Nice filler.

RATING: 5
Nice art.  Odds are it's not avoiding Xs, it's minimizing the number.  Sometimes it can be better to take an X rather than mark a number and prompt the need for more Xs.  
(Found the pad to be a bit small to work with - idea is to be mobile, and space and cost saving -- but could see making and laminating a 200% copy.)  It is nice to compete against others with the same numbers (vs playing solitaire).
Into the box of dice games with Quixx, 20 Express and others.
(Selling for $35 to $50 right now - but a good price point is more in the range of $8 to $15.)

Much better than I was expecting. It is, of course, a multi-player solitaire matching games like Take It Easy and Cities (both of which I love playing). Rolling Japan has the same feel in that all the players are doing the same thing at the same time, but each to their own. We found that we needed to check each other's sheets as mistakes are easy to make. But after playing a 4P game, we all said we'd make different choices, and try to avoid blunders.

Really interesting to see yet another game appear out of apparently nothing. Very interested to see the next maps.

An excellent and concise introduction to the "failure is fun" school of gaming. The (intentional) lack of any player interaction at all makes it clear that any frustration you have is with the game itself, or perhaps the cruelty of fate, rather than your fellow players.

If there ever was a game that could be accused of being "multiplayer solitaire," then this is it. That's probably the biggest complaint here as fans of Sudoku-like puzzles should enjoy this one (as I do). While there is certainly a lack of interaction, I appreciate flexibility in player count and game length and do enjoy seeing how different each player's solution ends up being. It's a unique game that I would certainly consider adding to one's collection of filler games.

Spiel 2014 - last copy of the fair!

Interesting Qwixx like game where you need to put numbers in different regions on an abstract map of Japan. It's enjoyable but in our 2 games the scores were very close to each other and we're not sure how much strategy there is. Overall a satisfying game that needs some more plays to fully grasp the full of it.

Qwixx is far better and more enjoyable to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another really clever dice game that feels similar to Quixx without actually playing the same. 

I say this because both games are about making the best out of dice rolls according to a set of placement rules on a scoresheet.

In Rolling Japan though, the scoresheet is more akin to a map, a geometric map of Japan in this case.

What also sets Rolling Japan apart is that each turn the players must place the same values as everyone else after a single roll is made. This simultaneous play allows the game to finish in a short timeframe regardless of how many are playing. 

And that's another strength of the game as it can accommodate up to 8 players! 

Clever dice play at its best. A great filler.

RATING: 7
I quite enjoyed this. The reason for not rating higher is that I suspect no matter how well you plan your placements, you'll probably just get shafted by the dice in the end anyway. But at least there's a process of risk minimisation which improves your odds, and that provides some nice decisions early in the game. Your options grow more limited as the game progresses, becoming more a process of seeing how your early decisions pan out. Still, it's a nice easy game to teach and interesting to play and comes in at a good time frame for a game of this ilk.

Based on one play: I am really liking these simple, dice based fill up your sheet games. They frustrate me to no end at each roll but are so much fun.

Véletlenszerűen 7 színű kockából választunk és a dobott értéket fel kell jegyeznünk a Japánt szimbolizáló térképünkre, amik színek szerint tartományokra vannak osztva. Számot beírni úgy lehet, hogy szomszédos tartományhoz képest csak 1-el térhetnek el egymástól. Ha nem tudjuk beírni a kidobott számot az adott színű területre a szabály betartásával, akkor egy X-et kell elhelyeznünk valahova. A 8. kör végén, akinek a legkevesebb X és üres mezeje maradt nyeri a játékot.
Rendkívül egyszerű, aranyos kis kockás játék, ami akár 99-en is játszható!

RATING: 6
A multiplayer solitaire game that reminds me of Sackson's dice rolling game Choice. Players roll two of seven differently colored dice and try to place numbers in an abstracted map of Japan delineated into six quadrants. Color of the die indicates which region to place number. Key is number placement cannot differ by more than 1. So, number placement is restricted. If no number can be placed, an "X" is put on the map. Players play 6 of the 7 dice each round and play extends for eight rounds before a winner is decided by the fewest number of Xs' played on the map.

The game is what it is: a solitaire exercise to score points. While all players share die rolling responsibilities, there is no interaction amongst players. Like Choice, Quixx, Mosaix and other dice games, this one is good for a few plays, a few laughs and likely to fade into the background in favor of the latests releases.

This is a fun abstract puzzle game. It reminds me of Sudoku in a sense, but of course with you filling in random numbers as you go, trying to abide by the placement rules. You quickly learn to love 3s and 4s, like 2s and 5s, and hate 1s and 6s.  :D

One to ninety nine players? Yes, no problem for this one. But you might need a really big room to do so. This is a really easy game. Rules are explained in less then 5 minutes, as all of them are described above. Is this one fun? Yes, it really is. You’ll learn to love 3’s and 4’s. Like 2’s and 5’s, and hate 1’s and 6’s. This is just a big puzzle game, with a lot of luck in it. Perfect as a filler game to play with experienced players when you’re waiting for the last player to come in to play a game like Advanced Civilization. As it is really hard to get, we made our own copy of it from a screen capture of a rules explaining video. Printed the capture out on a sheet of paper a couple of times and laminated them. Just write down the numbers on them with a whiteboard marker. Buy 7 colored dice and a cloth bag to put the dice in and you can go and enjoy.

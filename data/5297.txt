World War 1 in 100 counters (only 80 odd combat). One of my group was kind enough to sell me this for a pittance and I've played it loads. Yes the map is ugly as hell. Yes the cut off in Turkey limits Allied options but add some of the fine suggestions on the Geek for play balance and you have a super game and a fine simulation of a conflict that is playable in an evening. Brilliant game. There is a good reason it has been re-imagined twice in the last few years.

Best game SPI ever produced. Replay value is low if you like movement but the CRP chart gives a good feel of the futility of the trench warfare of the western front. You are battering away at the hindeburg line or verdun and suddenly you realise you might not have the resources to last the year.

This is the best WWI simulation I've found, as it forces the players* to experience the Supreme Commands' increasingly desperate frustration with a war that - just - won't - budge - from its mutual death-grip.  It's the 'extreme opposite in scale' visceral equivalent to playing "Trenchfoot".

*via the 2 mechanisms of:
1) starting after the West Front stalemate; and
2) restricting the players from attempting 'game-changing' strategies, such as unrestricted sub warfare in 1915, or a naval assault to open the Baltic Sea to connect Russia with its western allies

This is a game that treads a fine line between being brilliantly succinct and just plain superficial. Like an optical illusion it depends on how you are looking at it at a given moment. If nothing else it is quick, and surprisingly entertaining (even the Western Front despite there being almost no movement there), and paints a broadbrush picture that, like all worthy art, contains some Truth about its subject.

Impressive that this game covers such a great area, moderate level of complexity and outcome seems accurate.

At one time, I owned the SPI version. And later, the Decision Games version. The SPI version was the better of the two, IMO, and was for two decades my favorite treatment of the Great War in Europe for its elegance and accurate recreation of the meat-grinder that marked the warfare by attrition in Europe. This game has been completely eclipsed in play, production, and faithfulness to history by Phalanx's The First World War.

update: 

I've had to downgrade my rating after revisiting this title recently.  Competent play of the Russian forces in particular makes a Central Powers victory virtually impossible.  I've heard the DG version has a fix for the most gamey cause of this unbalance, but have yet to find details.  And so, the game's replayability suffers.

-----------------------

An elegant, approachable take on the first World War that remains fresh decades later.  I got the game almost 40 years after it was published and we played three times in a row ... something that can't be said for most games now-a-days.  Anyone interested in WWI needs to consider this title.  (comments re: SPI original edition)

The map portrays the European Theater of operations from Netherlands to the northeastern part of Turkey. It has few counters and the game rules allow for a fast pace wargame. Although time period does not allow great manouvres, the light action gives satisfaction and fun to wargamers. The game mechanics are easy and combat is represented in an abstract way giving accurate results. Almost all nations dragged into this war are represented in the game plus minor countries like: Serbia, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey etc. The game manages to give a taste of why and how things happened a century ago.

Very clever game that makes WWI interesting by focusing not on the operational manoeuvring on each front (which were static for long periods) but on the allocation of resources between fronts. Recording manpower losses on off-map tracks (rather than flipping units) speeds play and is chillingly appropriate for the first total war of the industrial age. Plays fast and you can finish the whole thing in a single session that doesn't leave you feeling beat to death (unlike so many war games). Perhaps the system can be broken by gamey tactics, but I avoid that sort of opponent.

RATING: 6.5
Great game at the time, but repeated playings have revealed optimum strategies.  Really only good for solitaire where you can trust yourself to avoid playing for the cheap win.  Still good for a newcomer who wants to learn about the war through a game, provided you are on good behavior because otherwise he will only learn about the game and your character.

As released, broken and unplayable. Lots of problems, including map and counter errata. (see CSW thread)

With months of volunteer beta-testing by purchasers of this broken game, some sort of playable game has emerged.

I don't enjoy buying half-baked games, especially those based on a venerable design.

Since I'm not in the habit of paying good money for the privilege of being a playtester, I will never again buy another "product" from DG.

RATING: 6
An excellent strategic model and a poor operational model combine to make a mixed bag out of this early Dunnigan S&T effort.  Countries receive a number of combat resource points (warm bodies), and when these run out, their armies start to disappear.  This strategic model works quite well, apart from the lack of victory point spaces in the Balkans, and the resulting game feels like World War I.  Everybody is running out of men; the only question is who will run out of men first.  The operational model, however, is quite poor and results in a number of gamey tactics.  Strong ZOCs and the six-month turn scale create all kinds of problems, but the biggest offender by far is the retreat rules.  These actually broke the original game, and SPI later changed the Russian surrender requirements to compensate.  They should have fixed the retreat rules instead.  The game in its current form still has a number of issues:
1) The Germans can defend the Western Front with only two armies without any concern for loss of territory.
2) The Balkans are nearly worthless.
3) The operational system is so incapable of handling the mobile warfare of August 1914 that the game just begins in September.

I've owned this three times.....I had a SPI magazine copy back in the 70s when I was a kid. In the noughties I picked up a Decision Games 2nd edition boxed set with (slightly) better production values (although not everyone will agree with that statement, especially those averse to hats). Just lately I've picked up the Decision Games S&T 2015 version with the larger map, counter sheet and rulebook which I've yet to get into. I guess you could say I've got history with this game!

It plays reasonably quickly for a hex wargame (these things are relative), and it reflects the grinding nature of the trenches by having 3 combat rounds for each movement round.

The effect of those combat rounds is generally to reduce the 'resource points' (or citizenry, if we're being blunt) of the combatants, making it a war of attrition. Only when a nation is out of resource points must it cede grounds or lose units (although it can voluntarily do so to preserve resources).

The western front is a meatgrinder, with the French and British trying to wear down the Germans. The game is more likely to be won or lost on the Eastern front, depending on how long it takes for the German player to knock the Russians out of the war. A careful Russion player will fall back rather than see his manpower resources bled white, especially as he will take double losses in combat with German forces.

Two scenarios feature: a historical set up which favours the Alles, and a free set up which (if played right) favours the central powers, as I recall.

While it's relatively simple for its genre, it's still one for the hex wargamer only. A liking for Settlers is unlikly to ensure you'll enjoy this one.

RATING: 7
(DG version) I am impressed, especially considering the age of the design, at how cleanly and quickly this game captures the essence of WWI. As the Western Allies, you will hammer your troops against the German trenches over and over again – not to capture territory so much as to drive down Germany’s RP’s in a desperate bid to drain its offensive power. As the Russians, you will try to bring Austria down before Germany can field a large army in the East. As the Central Powers, to win you must knock the Russians out as quickly as possible (not only for the obvious reasons, but also because you score more VP’s the earlier you do so), and you must capture at least a few resource hexes in France. 

There are a few “gamey” touches – Russia loses twice as many points in combat with Germans, for example, and the Allies score 75 VP’s at the end of the game for the Blockade – but they are required to keep the game competitive and historically accurate. 

That being said, the Eastern Front didn’t feel quite right. Austria-Hungary can hold its own against Russia without German help. Russian armies must outnumber the Austrians 2-1 to make any gains; no Brusilov offensive here. And, due to the higher loss rate, there’s rarely any good reason for Russia to attack Germany. 

Finally, the Near East is missing with the exception of the Caucasus(although I think it was included as a supplement in a later issue of S&T). Not only does that eliminate an interesting theater, it leaves Turkey and Britain with not a whole lot to do through the course of the game. 

However, those are little nits. This game will definitely be staying in my collection and hitting the table again soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decision Games 2015 S&T edition, updating this SPI old game.  Check the entry World War 1: 1914 - 1918 also. 

Note to self: Units in the game are army level. They did not die. Rather, casualties were reflected by losses of CRP's (manpower losses) on a track of the mapsheet. 

Having read some of the rules covering the sequence of play, movement and combat, it looks like Decision Game third edition is juicy and meaty wargame. 

No movement rating on the counters - they all move at the same rate in summer (five MPs) and in winter (4MPs).  They can entrench by flipping to the other side of the counters.  eZOC and fortifications can interdict Line of Communication (LOC) and supply. Units in OOS can be permanently eliminated.  Concentric attack would double the loss points (LPs) to the defender and often it is the way to eliminate the enemy units as a unit is eliminated when the LPs exceed its defense strength.  

Each side alternate its impulse by activating a Front, units in which can perform movement and combat.  The map is divided into Western Front, Eastern Front and the Other.  You complete one front before moving to the next one.  

With repeated plays, and having clarified and absorbed much of the rules, however, the game seems to grow on me with its strategic mechanisms well embedded within.

It was a fun and fascinating but somewhat broken game.

I think it had 1 movement phase for each side, and 4 combat phases for each side. An effective attack often required 2 or 3 attacking armies to mass against 1 defending army, so on the Eastern Front, it was possible to retreat from the 1st attack to spoil the 2nd through 4th. I think it would have worked better with more movement phases.

WWI is a fun game that can be played in a few hours.  Easy to set up and play.  Incorporated the rule where Italy on a die roll of six could still join the Central Powers.  Own all versions.

Good game, but watch for errata and variant rules depending on the edition you have.  I like allowing a free attack into an unoccupied hex if one's unit is not in a ZOC (in ZOC ok if Stoss, 1 hex advance).  Also consider using the max RP printed on the map as an absolute max to discourage hoarding and concomitant inaction, with an effect of discouraging fullscale attacks until turn four.  Require a 3 result for Stoss infiltration to reduce their game breaking abilities.  Use SPI folio rule that each hex retreated subtracts one from attacker loss.  Given to RW; copy traded.

Slightly sluggish but nonetheless provocative treatment of the Great War. There are certainly plenty of choices for players to make in an attempt to win...do I retreat, or pay the BRP (blood) price to hold the territory?

This is the kind of game SPI could produce! Potentially exciting, sometimes tense, easy, fast, replayable, and even the patina of history. This is ONLY true if the Stosstruppen do NOT have the special infiltration tactic given in the rules. Otherwise none of the game matters except the certain loss of ALL Resource Centers in France to infiltration during the last 4 game turns giving a CP victory. Without this change I'd rate this game as a 3, playable but why bother.

Update: Jeff Myers' suggestion to require a 3 result for a Stoss inflitration is excellent.

There are some quirky situations the rules do not address. Does a conquered Fortification only need to be in supply to be rebuilt so the one Serbia Fort/Supply Center must be garrisoned? Can Minor units on their Supply Centers be loaned CRPs even if surrounded by ZOC? Can a conquered but not in enemy ZOC Supply Center build units? These all come up in the Balkans.

The mixed AH/Ger attacks in the East, lack of Ger attacks in the west after turn 2, and the too easy lending of CRP really hurt the historic lessons of this game.

For a game with almost no movement it is interesting. The game is mostly managing your resources and forcing your opponent to burn resources, so your opponent runs out during the turn and you don't

The best WWI game I've seen to date.  Makes static warfare exciting.  Gives the right feel on both the east and west fronts.  One unit per hex makes for an interesting mechanic.  Deserves way more play than I give it.

Serious flaw in original magazine edition of the game, properly played Russians are impossible to defeat. However the flaw was fixed in the the DG version of the game, even though I found the counter art work to be disappointing compared to the original.
Oh, and of course I recommend the Cyberboard Expanded version in the Files list. This adds the entire Ottoman Empire, Lawrence, the Kaiser's navy, and many other things, including Mexico.

 Played the original and think the new DG version is a very good improvement. Still needs a few minor tweaks to be able to represent the European theater in WW 1 while the rest of the world war went on, so a Home Rules section will be added soon to consolidate the edits/additions our group has made to the DG version of the game (NOT A GAME REDO).

SPI folio series game of WWI in the West. Corps level treatment, with decent components, map, and fairly simple rules that do an excellent job of conveying the feel of the near static struggle in the trench lines. Players have limited numbers of attacks per turn, and generally lose ground instead of units in battle. A national will track may end the game if losses are too much for the populace to bear. A great game that can be played in less than two hours.

Decision Games version: Ok, perhaps it is a dicefest and there really isn't a whole lot of movement, but this game does a fantastic job of simulating the sheer number of lives lost and the crazy expense of WWI. Still, there is a real game here.  This really makes you feel like you are fighting for every inch. The game is all about how to take your losses: when you take the hit on the economic chart, how to diffuse the hits between factions, when to lose a fort and when and how to retreat.  

The CRT is so brutal for the attacker, that initially it doesn't make any sense to attack, but soon you see the brilliance in the game as you use expendable resources of others to wear down those that can do the most damage.  The best attack result is not all that great, but when things go wrong they are awful, what makes the system work is that the game compels the attack as you throw more boys to the front.

Most of all I like that the loss of men translates into economic loss rather than unit loss, this maintains the feel of the lines in WWI well and it doesn't create a snowball scenario.  Because of this, maintaining supply is most important, as that is the only easy way pieces can get eliminated. One of the real features of the game is the low unit count, which increases the tension of the manipulation of your fronts.  Losing a unit to supply when you are only barely holding the front is tough.

This game feels like you are sliding down a steep slope with only half a grip and you are constantly scrambling hoping to get a grip in the loose shale.  

Damn, those Serbs are pesky!

There is a lot I like about this.  It is simple, can be played rather quickly (especially given its scale), has counters with pictures of headgear, etc.  But I just don't find it a lot of fun.  There is something unexciting about destroying Resource Points.  I understand that the game cannot focus a whole lot on maneuver, given the subject matter, but I just feel that I don't have enough to do in this game.

Excellent simple SPI game (republished by DG) that works well as a true grand strategic look at WWI. This is basically a resource management game with little detail, but it really conveys the feel of the conflict. Probably the best addition to a collection possible if you want a game on the subject, but don't want to slog through the details. Rules are a bit vague here and there in both the SPI and DG editions.

Excellent game, covers the topic well at the right level of detail for grand stategy. Not a great amount of depth for endless replay, but nice to take off the shelf a few times a year for a Saturday afternoon. DG graphics were not appreciated by everyone, but I prefer it to the SPI original (one of the few times).

The original SPI title is designed to have you fight the war, drawing losses from your manpower pool unless you choose instead to take a retreat. This works well to duplicate the static nature of the fronts, because eventually one side or the other will run out of reserves there. The DG version added some needless chrome. The original is fine without modification. 

Basically a simple all fronts WWI for a single sitting, suitable for easy learning and playing within a 4 hour period.

RATING: 7
Super low-density chit game. Most grinding losses are taken directly by your economy rather than in unit losses, so the line does a pretty good impression of the static WWI lines, until economic collapse forces retreat. Novelty game.

Suggested fixes to address degenerate strategies: 1) allow free one-hex move before combat if it moves a unit not in an EZOC into an EZOC, 2) make the appearance of Stoss units conditional on Russian surrender (or maybe just army collapse). Saw both of these on the CSW thread.

The latter is somewhat historically justified in that eastern successes informed Stosstrupen tactics. The in-game reason is to prevent the CP from simply sitting on their RPs until they get Stoss troops automatically. The first change prevents a slow CP retreat from prevent all fighting (since CP always move second). You could disallow this free move in the first combat for units that used their full MP during the move phase.

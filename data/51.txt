RATING: 7
Very interesting multi-player puzzle game. The puzzle changes every turn. Whoever solves it first (or best) wins the point.

Very cool game but my feeling is that after a few plays, the game would get old fast.

RATING: 8
It's a brillant game that can be played by a theorically unlimited number of players. Few rules and a very deep strategy. Definetely a brain burning game! It's basically an abstract but it deserves a place in every gamer's board game collection!

Not for everyone, but I love it, particularly when you have an even group of people, which doesn't happen often enough. Usually, you'll have one or two people zipping through each mini-puzzle, which can frustrate the others.

Ricochet Robot is a great brain burner, but it is also quite tiresome (which I guess is not surprising for a brain burner). Some people will be mentally exhausted before the end of the game. Despite being a simple game to teach, it is only for people who love a good challenge and who have good spatial visualization abilities.

LIKE: Intense yet creative thinking.

OVERALL: Simple and very clever game. Quite fun to play and figure out the optimal moves. Fun to be an observer, too.

I didn't played a full game of this, but it was more than sufficient to understand the feel of the game. It is a simple and elegant game, with a lot of depth because it makes you think a lot in a path. This game priorize the fast thinking of the best route. So speed and perception is the key to win this game. I like this and recomend.

"Plays: 1."  Yeah, maybe since I was on BGG.  Scores of times previously.  A fantastic brain-burner.  Is there a lot of player interaction?  Of course not.

Perhaps more a brain test than a game. But if it is a game, then it is a terrific one. The game element is to solve the puzzle quicker than your opponents, which requires a more than good thinking in spite of the simplicity of its gamesystem. Not everybody can play this game well, so it won't appeal to everyone.

Wonderful game with the right crowd! However, a difference in talent for / experience with the game will cause great differences in points between players and can take away a lot of the fun for everyone.

I'm worse than no good at this game, but I'm more than willing to give it another try. I just can't visualize the routes, while my friends shout them out quickly.  This is an analytical game, not for the folks who like word games.

This game scales well with simultaneous play so there is no downtime.

What if Set was a game about Robots on an icy floor? This takes a classic video game puzzle and turns it into a race of pattern recognition, just like Set's perception-burning goodness. It's quite less portable, though, which is a big point against it, and additionally I got tired of playing it far quicker than I get tired of Set. I look forward to playing this again, though - just because a game can get exhausting doesn't mean it isn't great!

It's a logic puzzle game but one that is not very creative.

If you feel that competative labyrinth solving makes a good game, this will have you bouncing all over. If you struggle with visualisations, or are cursed with playing partners who are simply better at it, it might be frustrating or simply boring. Place yourself in the appropriate category.

p: to me this is genius, eventhough I'm not sure if speed-puzzling is a "game" as I would define it. But who cares? Boy this is fun. Playable by just about any amount of players you can squeeze around the table, and that number usually grows each round if you play it in a busy place. Highly addictive, intriguing and incredibly challenging. Amazingly, it has never felt repetative, when repetative bouncing from a to b is litterally all you ever do. Fabulous eye-opening game to play with friends and family who think that, apart from Trivial Pursuit and Monopoly, there isn't much out there, and for whom you know a straight jump to Settlers would be a bit too hardcore. And this is great fun for casual and hardcore gamers alike, and, dare I say, simultaneously.

When I have huge respect for the designs of Alex Randolph, to me they are either too kiddies or too boringly old school, with one obvious exemption. But just when I wondered if he would have been as renowed today if he had the competition that game designers face these days, this gem appeared and I firmly decided never to doubt the man's credentials ever again.

As for the game, I must admit, eventhough you can happily play it by yourself, maybe its additional appeal, and explanation why it has been such a success, is exactly because it is a competative game rather than a solitaire puzzle.

The real joy, to me, is without doubt the opportunity to impress the pants of your mates, by coming up with fiendishly clever moves and highly efficient combos, using as many bots as possible. The limited time element is a great addition, and the first call certainly focuses people's minds. It's infuriating when you just have puzzled out the only possible route as 11 when a few seconds later someone calls 4.... "What!?!" seems to be the most frequently uttered cry during this game, right before "you gotta be kidding, how?".

My favourite game-moment is still a call for "7312" straight after the goal was revealed, and how the immediate timer countdown confused the lot. Third round in our virgin game. People were still in stitches when the last grain of sand fell through, which unfortunately meant I actually had to come up with the solution ... and I cracked it without hesitation. Never to be repeated again.

For folk with little ones: my partner's nieces are getting a bit older, about 10, growing out of the kiddies games we spoilt them with, and I wondered if this could be their next step up into the wonderful world of games, x-mas coming and all. At first they struggled a bit, and I adjusted "the rules" to: if I called a number and they could see how I did it before the timer ran out, they would get the point. Which worked perfectly. Not much later one of them was actually underbidding me ("what!?!"), so it certainly eased them into it. It is also a simple-rules-game they can play with their mates unsupervised, and with something as unusual and perfect as this, they will be the envy of their peers once again.

2ND EDITION: we initially added this set for the alternative and interchangable boards alone, but the clever variation with the coloured angled screens was a welcome surprise. Another twist to burn your brains on. Fab.

ONLINE 1PL VERSION: I have occasionally dabbled in solving the daily challenges posted in the online Ricochet Robots, and always wondered how folk could solve it rougly in time in which it would appear on my screen. Surely no-one would be cheating there, would they. Great daily diversion though, and certainly beating mine-sweeper and spider-solitaire. Not that I would ever waste the bosses time having a few minutes of private fun with any of these, off course.

ANCESTRY: I knew I had seen the mechanism for RR somewhere before, and it has finally come to me, Alex Randloph's "Die Verbotene Stadt" had the same movement mechanics but packed it in a more colourfully themed family game.

Mukavaa järkeilyä, mutta kuitenkin melko simppeliä. Siis verrattuna kunnon strategia pelien tuhannen asian optimointisekoon. Menee välipelinä, joskin ainakin pienellä pelaajamääällä voi kestää kotvan. Menee myös ihan kunnon pelinä, on aika hyvä. (4.10.2009)

Pieni päivitys. Kyllähän tämä on nimenomaan välipeli, jos peli ensinkään. Jos esim. odotellaan jonkun saapuvan, niin tän voi pistää pöytään ja järkeillä siinä sitte. Tai jonkun isomman pelin jälkeen ei muutaku pöytään, ja järkeillään siinä sitte. Joka tapauksessa tyyliin "nostetaan pöytään, ja järkeillään siinä sitte, kunnes aletaan joku oikea peli". (23.3.2010)

This was a present from my 2008 International Secret Santa.

Very interesting. The board is able to be put together many different ways and the robots position is updated after each round meaning there are nearly endless possibiliities of puzzles to solve. While it would not truly be a game, there is no reason that you couldn't drag this one out and play it solo.

Certainly makes you think quickly and plan well ahead along the lines of a combination of Roborally and Set.

With the original rules I give it a 7, with this variant it is hovers between a 9 and a 10.

Check it out, especially if the game has lost its appeal for you.  Its a totally different and, IMHO, much better game.

Hi! I'm Doctor Steve Brule with another episode of [b]Brule's Rules[/b]

Have you ever played a game of Ricochet Robots with random board placement but wanted to place your robots randomly too? Just roll a 4-sided die and two different color 8-sided dice all at once: The 4-sided die determines which of the four modular boards the robot will start on (left to right, top to bottom). The 8-sided dice create a vector, with one color die determining horizontal placement, and the other color die vertical, both radiating from the bottom left corner of each board. Repeat for each robot used.  Why didn't you think of that, ya dingus?

Yikes. Totally not what I was expecting.

Played with two other people, and the gameplay was less than stimulating... Sit around the board in silence, stare at it, until someone comes up with a solution and shouts out the number of moves they believe to be required. There is, of course, a pressure to be the first one to find the solution, and that tension is arguably the draw for many players, but I did not care for it. It felt eerily similar to the stress one feels when trying to answer an essay question on an exam in the final minutes of the class period.

No obvious player interaction. Felt like an "I'm-smarter-than-you" game. No competitive strategy, other than that involved in solving the puzzle. Winner feels good, everyone else feels dumb. 

That was my experience. Not one you will find in my collection.

HOWEVER
This is, in my eyes, made to be a solo game experience. In that regard, without the stress of being the first to find the solution, it would be a nice brain exercise.

Ricochet Robots fills a great niche - you can set it up at the beginning of a game night, and people can join as they walk in.  It's very puzzly.  Everyone stares at the board until someone comes up with a solution to the current problem, and then it suddenly turns frantic as everyone else has 1 minute to come up with a better one.

It has a few issues.  The puzzles are random and this mostly works very well, but will occasionally result in a series of challenges that are much too easy.  Also, if one player in your group is just much better than everyone else, it's not very fun.  For that last reason, I've stopped bringing it to my main game night as often.

But it's very fun, and I still bring it out quite a bit.

Updated 10/30/10.

Ricochet Robots is either my highest 5 or my lowest 6. A simple, non-traditional party game, Ricochet Robots works because it doesn't try to be anything more than it is. It's also my favorite party game ever (I really dislike party games). Essentially the game just asks all players to solve a complex spatial/movement puzzle simultaneously in their heads, then shout out the number of moves in which they think they can complete the puzzle. If no one underbids them in the next 30 seconds, they get to demonstrate the solution for points. Simple, effective, and accommodating of any number of players.

There are some drawbacks, however. First, some people are simply better than others at the type of reasoning needed. This isn't Galaxy Trucker. You're being judged at your real-time problem-solving ability, which can really put some people on the spot. It's not much of a party to have one player sitting quietly off to the side knowing he or she has no chance, while super-spacial-reasoning guy underbids everyone else by 5 moves. Second, the game gets repetitive. There are 17 or so points up for grabs, which is probably too many, given that you're doing the exact same thing every time (even in games like Apples to Apples, each turn has some differences in thinking through particular associations). By the time you've done this 12 times, you're not really interested in playing any more. Finally, the game just seems to lack any significance as a game. Maybe this is a problem with all party games, but at the end of the game, no one really cares who won. Each round seems to exist in a vacuum, and it's always more of a personal challenge (to see if you can solve the puzzle) than a competitive game against others.

Still, it's at least as fun as watching TV.

A fun little brain burner. It took a little to get into the groove of this, but when we did it sailed along well for the 2 newbies. The veteran sailed form the beginning. It could have gotten frustratingly bad if not for us finally clicking with how to get those robots around the board. I want to find it. Not desperate for it, but a definite "Like to Own".

RATING: 9
Simple rules, allows an arbitrary number of players, quick to play for an arbitrary number of turns. This is fun!
BIGGEST DRAWBACK:
While it is the perefect game to kick-off a games evening while waiting for more players to arrive, it will never be the main game for a games evening, since you can only play it for a short time before it gets boring or people are burnt-out.
MOST IMPORTANT HOUSE-RULE:
Players with fewer victory points always get precedence, even if the find the same solution later. This strongly encourages newbies to learn the game at all. We always play it like this and the experts will win nevertheless, albeit by a much smaller margin.

Competitive programming. Sometimes a brute force solution is the most efficient, but usually you need to elegantly use those other robots. If you aren't into silently staring and occasionally calling out numbers, you probably won't enjoy this game. Oh yeah, and solving spatial problems. I mean, it's a game of trying to solve spatial problems faster than everyone else.

This is probably my favourite game to lose a round at. I love seeing the elegant solutions my opponents come up with.

I've always loved these types of puzzles, so I was really looking forward to this game. I was not disappointed. It's a great brain burner. And it's great for a large group (though you'd really have to have the right group). The scoring is a little funny since it allows whoever is in last to catch up really quickly when there's really obvious puzzles, but it doesn't really matter. My new second favorite brain burner (after Zendo).

Update: Upgraded to the Z-Man edition for the extra boards because this still gets a lot of play & love from me! Recommended.

Rules couldn't be any simpler but man oh man, trying to remember all the move variations in one's head can certainly be a brain twister. Not a game to play when you are drunk!

A quite unique game! It’s a solitaire game for 1 to as many people as you like, so that’s something you don’t see every day! The “game” is more like a solitaire puzzle in which each player try to get the same robot to a destination in as few moves as possible, but you need to think it through without actually move the robot, and there are some rules for the movement pattern which can make the game a real brain burner! Some people like it, some hate it, but with the right crowd it’s actually a pleasant game.

This game is pretty versatile in that it can be played for any pre-determined number of rounds to act as a filler.  It's something of a brain-burner though, and players who have more practice have a definite advantage.  It's not difficult to pick up the rules, though.

RR is a puzzle game which you play with other players. Each player is trying to solve the uniwue puzzle that is presented before their opponent. This is a competitive game, but don't think for a moment that there is any agreession invovled. It is the definition of multiplayer solitaire! For all that it is challenging and engaging and folks will wonder why you are all staring a game board in silence.

Zelda ice block puzzles on a board.  A fun party game, but frustrating when you're sleep deprived and slow!  Played with a catch-up house rule: a player leading by at least 2 must defer to another player who announces the same route length within the time limit.  Not a good choice for groups of mixed nerdiness level.

The quality that this game has is that you cannot just stand and watch people play - you immediately get sucked in and start trying to solve the puzzle with the people that are playing. If this game starts as a 2p game, it will likely end as a 4p game with more people hovering and participating! The longer I own this game, the more I start calling it a "must have" for any game collection.

Puzzle game that is probably the perfect fit for a certain kind of mind, mine not being that certain kind. Game seems balanced, well thought out, and seats as many people as you'd like. It can also play for any length of time, and seems like it would have great return value if you enjoy it. Just extremely dry for me, and nothing that draws me back. I prefer more interaction in my spatial puzzles (i.e.: Java, Pueblo)

I definitely recommend this game but it is one that you are either good at or you're not.  Since the game is a logic puzzle with multiple solutions certain people are more prone to finding those solutions and the rest are usually left behind and frustrated.  It's definitely worth trying but try it before you buy it.

Playing this game is just an embarassment for me, in that my train of thought is more like a snail. I've solved puzzles with the same goal (sliding a robot to a certain square on a grid), and while I think they translate well to a "bidding" gameplay and I wouldn't say no to a game, I still prefer the solo puzzle version.

The 1 min. sand timer is very useful in other boardgames too!

I really like this game. It is good for the start of a games night when people are drifting in. This game suffers from exaggerated differences in ability. The scoring system might help equalise it but it is usually a game between two players regardless of how many are playing.

RATING: 3
Not really a board game in my opinion - more of a competitive puzzle. It is quite intense trying to figure out the best move, or in some cases trying to figure out a move at all. The easy moves are a case of who traces the right way first - if you start the wrong way you lose the easy ones. All of us got one of the easy moves based on who went the right way first. Then we got to one case where the move was so complicated no one was able to actually call out a number to get there and the move had to be stepped through as a group in a number of stages (and that was after more than 10 minutes of thinking) with the easier setting with the silver robot in play. 

Flawed as a game - but if you are a talented mathematician and enjoy brain burning puzzles in a group setting this could work for you. Sadly, I am neither. Would still play again at some point.

One play - okay, this game is not going to be for everyone.  Really it's a speed puzzle solve with a 'Name that Tune' style bid (I can solve this puzzle in five moves ...).

When we first started playing I wasn't seeing anything and after three or four decided this wasn't for me.  But then all of a sudden I started seeing solutions and would get increasingly excited and interested as each token was turned over.

It's worth noting that we played with a so-called "newbie rule" that's not in the regular rules; that anyone with fewer tokens than the bidder could match/steal the existing bid if they could make it.  I like that rule as I think RR works best as a party game.  A thinking-man's party game mind you, but a party game none-the-less.

The goal of this game is to capture chips with the active robot.  Four double sided modular boards are arranged in a square to start.  Four differently colored robots are placed randomly on the board.  A goal chip is selected at random and put on the center platform.  This shows a picture of the space a robot has to move to.  The color denotes which robot has to move there.  The goal is to move the robot to that space in as few moves as possible.  Robots can move orthagonally.  If they hit an object such as a wall or another robot, they must stop, ricochet left or right.  Other robots may be moved following the same rules.  Then, the fun begins!  Players each think of a route to move the active robot to the goal.  Any player can make a bid of the number of moves this route will take.  The first player to do so flips a sand timer which gives the remaining players one minute to place their bids.  Players may bid more than once but each successive bid must be lower than the prior bid.  Another player may bid higher than a previous player.  Going in ascending bid order, a player moves the robot(s) along the routes.  If it is successful, they win the chip.  If it is not, robots are returned to their starting spaces and the next bidder resolves his route.

It was interesting as a solo puzzle.  I imagine it'll be entirely different with time pressure.

Khet for more players but then without the cool lasers. This game is not my cup of tea. For a game to be a game, I expect some laughter, activity, movement, interaction. I also expect there to be a clear goal on how to win. RR has a goal which you need to satisfy in order to win, but human-based heuristics are almost completely useless here. Ricochet Robots is about being entranced in mapping routes on the gameboard in your head in total silence, and then more or less losing interest as a player has found an efficient route which needs to be proven wrong within one minute. This blatant min-maxing is best left to a computer. It's not unlike playing Kakuro or Sudoku Challenge. 

If you want a fun and doable puzzle of this kind, I recommend Cities. Just as much puzzling, but at least interactive in the way that something is said from time to time, and that you can actually [i]see[/i] what the others are doing.

Highly enjoyable puzzle game for solo play.  I've never actually played it against others, and I doubt I ever will.  Reason being, I'm afraid my soloing would give me a nearly insurmountable advantage against any newcomer. Even without it, this is the type of game that tends to click with me more so than most others.

EDIT: I had to take the score up a tic, as I've become hopelessly addicted to the phone app, and the game has gradually become one of my favorites.  It's funny, because as a multiplayer game, there are some obvious issues with the rules, but as a solitaire pursuit, it's an absolutely flawless design.  More of a puzzle than a game, in truth.

Le jeu

Le plateau de jeu est composé de quatre quarts de plateau imprimés recto et verso. Vous avez ainsi 96 configurations possibles du plateau. Vous obtenez un tableau de 16x16 cases avec des obstacles figurés par des murs. En début de partie vous placez aléatoirement les quatre robots (bleu, vert, jaune, rouge) sur quatre cases différentes et tirez au hasard un jeton cible qui représente un symbole désignant une case unique sur le plateau (ex: triangle vert). Pour gagner vous devez être le joueur le plus rapide à amener le robot de la couleur de la cible sur cette case en un minimum de coups (ex: amener le robot vert sur la case triangle vert).

Les robots se déplacent orthogonalement et ne s'arrêtent que lorsqu'ils rencontrent un mur ou un autre robot car il ne peut avoir qu'un seul robot par case. Vous pouvez déplacer tous les robots et ce autant de fois que vous voulez.

Quelque soit la configuration du plateau et des robots il existe toujours des solutions.

Les joueurs sont ainsi tous en train de réfléchir simultanément au même problème, le premier à avoir trouvé une solution annonce haut et fort son nombre de mouvement et retourne le sablier. Les autres joueurs ont environ une minute pour trouver une solution avec moins de mouvements et l'annonceur peut aussi utiliser cette minute pour améliorer sa solution.

A la fin du temps octroyé par le sablier, le joueur qui a annoncé la meilleure solution la montre en déplaçant le ou les robots sur le plateau et prend le jeton cible qui sera comptabilisé comme un point en fin de partie. Il dévoile ensuite une nouvelle cible qui sera jouée avec la configuration d'arrivée du problème précédent. Si sa solution est incorrecte ou qu'il ne s'en souvient plus, c'est le joueur à avoir annoncé la meilleure solution après la sienne qui l'expose. Il ne faut donc pas hésiter à donner ses solutions même si elles sont moins bonnes.

Une partie comprend 17 points: 16 cibles régulières plus un cible particulière, la cible multi. Celle ci est figurée par un tourbillon multicolore et se joue un peu différemment : n'importe quel robot est concerné, il faut trouver celui qui se rend sur cette case avec le moins de mouvement. C'est le seul moment de la partie ou il y a un peu de hasard car pour l'emporter il faut réfléchir dés le départ avec le bon robot.

Mon opinion

Je considère Rasende Roboter comme un jeu exceptionnel, mais il n'est pas exempt de défauts. Le gros grief que l'on peut lui faire c'est que ce n'est pas vraiment un jeu de société, les joueurs réfléchissent chacun dans leur coin et l'interactivité est quasiment nulle. L'ambiance est tendue souvent électrique par moments, si pour vous le jeu de société rime avec rigolade débridée, passez votre chemin.

L'autre problème est l'homogénéïté des niveaux des joueurs. La rapidité ne vient qu'avec la pratique, et le novice n'a aucune chance de gagner une partie, il pourra au mieux marquer 2 ou 3 points. Certains donnent une pénalité de 30 secondes aux bons joueurs (ils découvrent la cible 30s après les autres). C'est un expédient qui devient vite ingérable surtout quand les niveaux sont disparates. La meilleure solution est bien entendu de s'exercer seul d'autant plus que Rasende Roboter reste passionnant en solo.

Alex Randolph à réalisé un coup de maître avec ce jeu capable d'auto générer des milliards de milliards de milliards (etc. ?) de problèmes différents et auquel vous pouvez jouer avec un nombre quelconque de joueurs, la seule limite étant le périmètre de votre table.

Vous vous rendrez compte que les joueurs ne se ressemblent pas, certains sont très rapides sur des coups en 8-10 mouvements, d'autres utilisent toujours plusieurs robots. Il est incontestable que ce jeu s'apparente à un univers mathématique mais derrière son austérité vous pourrez voir à la fois des idées géniales mais aussi apprécier l'élégance des solutions.

A mon avis chaque joueur doit essayer Rasende Roboter au moins une fois, ceux qui n'aiment pas le jeu le savent dès la première partie. C'est un investissement bien faible pour un jeu qui a le potentiel de devenir votre préféré.

Rasende Roboter est le jeu que je ressort le plus souvent, je ne m'en lasse pas c'est un gros coup de coeur qui mérite largement sa note. A l'heure où j'écris (janvier 2003) le jeu est épuisé et aucune réédition n'est prévue pour le moment. Pourtant une extension comprenant un cinquième robot est à paraître

I played this at a friend's house. He was very excited about me trying it because I like games (Caylus, Puerto Rico, El Grande, Tigris and Euphrates). I dislike this game very much. I won. In fact, in a three-player game with me, a construction manager, against two computer geeks I went on a five turn winning streak and won with 7 shortest routes, or whatever they are called.  I’d say more about this game but I don’t want to waste any more time with it.

An OK puzzle filler. This isn't a game I like to play for too long, but as a brief exercise between games it hits the spot. Essentially a spatial puzzle requiring players to mentally track possible moves, looking for the solution. Fastest and clearest thinking will win.

RATING: 8
Great game to introduce people to.  Seems very hard at first but then you start to see patterns.  My 7-year old loves it, he likes to figure out long, complex paths for each token instead of going for the shortest.  It's more of an activity than a game, no need to keep track of points.  Really fun.  

Some of my friends HATE it and others are naturally great at it.  Great game when taking the train to Pittsburgh, if you know what I mean.

Hey, this is fun. For a long time, I had a prejudice against this game, because I did not know anything about it and inexplicably thought it was a some kind of a spin-off of Roborally. Then I found out that the author of this game was Alex Randolph, the author of Twixt, which is one of my favourite games. I took a peek, and the rest is history. This is not actually a game, it's a puzzle. But a puzzle with very simple rules and sometimes very surprising and elegant solutions. It's quick, and it can play 1 to 20, how many games can boast that?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Brilliant puzzle/game and works well to while away a few minutes on your own. Record the total number of moves to solve all of the tokens and keep track of your best score to make it more interesting. 

When there are inexperienced players playing with more experienced players, insist that players cite the exact number of moves in their solution so that the less experienced players know when to look for an easy solution. This gives them more chance to catch up.

It's hard to rate this game. If played with opponents of about equal skill it's really great. On the other hand it can be rather frustrating or even boring depending on the other players skill level.

Update: Fun to play with kids. My 9 year old almost beats me which just shows how bad I am at this.

Update 2: Actually gets better the more you play it. Upped my rating to an 8.

RATING: 8
Rating after 1 play.  I don't think I like it as much as RoboRally but the game was a lot of fun.  I should say that I'm defining "fun" to mean "a challenge".  We played with hidden bids (used regular playing cards)...starting the timer as soon as the first bid is placed down.  A lot of angst as you wait for the timer to wind down, hoping your bid holds up. Richochet Robots stresses the "puzzle" aspect of RoboRally, but eliminates the interaction.  So if you like the idea in RoboRally of trying to get your robot to the flag, but hate when other robots bump or shoot you...this is a great game for you to pick up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Clever puzzle game where players must be the first to solve a maze of moving robots.  One of those games where some players will "see it" and win all the time, hence nobody else will want to play it with them!

RATING: 6
After more than a year of playing daily on ricochetrobot.com, I've gotten quite good at it, but I still find face-to-face competition too stressful to enjoy much.  And it's still not much fun if not everyone is roughly equal in skill.  I think the diagonal walls in the new edition are kind of lame, but maybe I'm just not used to them yet.

RATING: 7
It's a classic that is entertaining to introduce to new players.  It's nice to have a game without any player limit. Otherwise, it doesn't really have the game qualities I appreciate, so it's not something I would play often.

Update: This has grown on me a bit. It's not like other games but it has a certain charm. It has gone over really well with certain friends, but not so much with others.

It took a good 3 coins before I was able to get the hang of this, and still it's a little different thinking than I'm used to.  A friend owns this one.

One of those games that's more of a puzzle than a game.   Fun to play for a short while.  6 chips feels like too many to me, I probably like it better at 3 or so, but the game is flexible enough to play however you choose.   The robot bits are cool, and reason enough to get this instead of the Mutant Meeples variant.

Solid puzzle game.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing bad.  It's nice that it works with any number, and the race to find the quickest path can be quite tense when playing with good players.

Ricochet robots is an excellent addition to my boardgames cupboard, being completely different to anything else I own.

It's the ideal game for group situations given people can have a try and come and go as they want.

RATING: 2
"Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again." fits as a rather pretty good decription for me and thus my rating.  When I would attempt to play this game I was totally lost, spending several minutes to find things that other players were able to see almost immediately.  It's painful analytical work for those who's brains aren't built for that kind of processing.

Now don't get me wrong, for those that love this hyper fast logic exercise all the more power to you, but my mind operates almost completely on intuition and thus I completely suck at this game.

There are many arguments as to how one should be rating games, and some people say that low ratings shouldn't be given out for games that you "just aren't interested in".  I can see that point to some degree, however this game turns me off at such a gut level that I just want to put my .02 in and just say that this is not a game for a general audience, but a logic minded (and rapid quick thinking to boot) subset of the hobby audience.

This is one of those games that isn't based on the usual strategy brain centers.  You have to be good at scanning, visually computing, and quickly memorizing multiple groups of up to 10-15 ordered and sometimes disjointed steps.

This is another typical Alex Randolph game. I admire the mathematical ackground of his titles, and this one's similar.
Of course, for abstract games like this it is harder to get non-geek players interested, and I was quite surprised by how good a reception the game got in our round.
Not a very social game, as you spend all your brain capacity staring at the robots.

This is not my cup of tea. Too dry and calculational.  For my money, Fearsome Floors does this in a much more interesting and fun way by being able to eat your opponents' pieces and the threat of having yours eaten. More tension in that one whereas this is just a group puzzle to see who can do it quickest. They should've allowed the robots to shoot each other such that the first player to show a solution gets a shot. That would create some tension at least.

Strictly a puzzle game, how do you bounce your robot off the walls (you hit a wall and choose which way to go next but all the way to the next wall).  It doesn't seem open to multiple strategy levels.  It's made fun by racing against other players for the first lowest bid for a route.  Unfortunately, for a lot of turns, one player has an obvious winning route and it's pointless.  It has four quarter boards printed on both sides, which can be combined 8*6*4*2/4 ways so that every game is fresh for route finding.

This feels a lot like Repello, not in the particular movement rules, but in the general deep-search robot moving puzzle mechanic.

This game is way more fun than the photos on the box make it look.  Players stare at a board with obstacles, trying to find a path for a given robot to a given spot in their heads.

Very casual gamers may become flustered if playing with more hardcore types, though, so choose your players carefully.

Another instant classic.  A puzzle game.  Any number can play.  Great ice breaker for groups.  Can easily be played in teams, or make it a game of solitaire. Takes only minutes to learn.  Length of game adjustable.  Simple pieces & board, yet attractive.  The double sided, 4-section board can be rearranged 96 different ways.  Creative, clever--nothing else like it.  

Its brilliance: Throughout the game every round also creates a new board. (During a round, game piece(s) move and their ending position creates the new board.)

*I love this as a game of solitaire. 
*It is also an excellent game for a large group (easily a dozen), especially on game nights as people arrive. They can join in at anytime, they get refreshments and return. 
*It can be a brain burner for some, but it is impossible for them to slow the game down. 
*Lots of social interaction during the "Demonstration" phase which occurs repeatedly during each game. 
*There is an equalizer mechanic in the game. 
*You can determine the length of the game. 
*Simple rules are quickly explained. 
*Every initial setup can be different.
*Graphics & components are simple yet attractive. 
*This is another game many people request. 

Has seen the test of time--pulled out regularly by many in our gaming group.

Not so much a game as it is a competition to be the first to solve a puzzle. This is not a lively, interactive game that gets conversation going.

Ricochet Robots is a spatial multiplayer puzzle. The goal each round is to get a random robot to a random destination on the board in as few steps as possible. Everyone tries to solve it at the same time, and once somebody has offered a solution (ie. the number of steps needed) the other players get another 30 seconds to underbid. After that the player with the lowest number gets to show their solution, and scores a point if it's working.

The game situations sometimes require very careful orchestration of multiple robots. As there is no way to try your solution in advance other than going through it in your mind, the general difficulty level is rather high, and this probably serves to emphasize the effect that some people are clearly better at this kind of activity than others. Here, it's highly unlikely that one simply gets lucky. In a way, Ricochet Robots is the "look, don't touch" of Ubongoland.

After one play with my 8 year old grandson, I have to say that this is a good way to spend an hour.  He is now 12 and RR continues to be his favorite game.

Ricochet Robots was also a big hit when I showed it to 3 twenty-something fellows...the game went down to the very last chip, everyone had a chance to win.

Traded a copy of Magic Mountain for RR from a fellow BGG.

After playing the game solo, I've decided that there is something very satisfying about visualizing plexiglas robot figurines bouncing off imaginary obstacles and counting the number of moves.  The thinking process should appeal to Concrete Sequentials everywhere, and I are one of those.

This game isn't for everyone, but it's a fun, and sometimes frustrating ride.  I don't like speed games or puzzle games, and yet, I enjoyed this.  I've only played two player so far, but I look forward to trying it with more.  It makes for a nice brain exercise to get those brain juices flowing, and boy do I have one juicy brain.  Note to self: Martini's and Ricochet Robots don't mix.  (hic)

This is a very good puzzle game, which can be played in a group or solitaire. You really learn to think a new way. The trouble is that you often can't be sure that you've found the optimal solution, which makes solitaire play unsatisfying.

What a brain drain!  Ricochet Robots is a game in which you want to take your time and gradually improve your best score, sort of like a crossword puzzle, until you are happy with your result.  But you can't because it's a race, and that just *ruins* it.  Not a late night game when the mind is switching off and you just want something light.  At least it's over in an hour.  On the plus side, it's a very clever puzzle to solve and quite unique in it's mechanics.  It will challenge you to think spatially.  And given a leisurely Saturday morning you could probably enjoy it with the weekend comics.  But the idea is to do it the fastest and that just makes my head throb.

Ricochet Robot presents a series of visual puzzles that players compete to solve as quickly as possible.  It's as much a "mind sport" as a "game" in the usual sense of the word.  As with any sport, the experience can be frustrating if you're playing out of your league.  But there's a lot of trial and error involved in solving the puzzles, giving weaker players a chance to pick up a chip here or there.  And if someone isn't enjoying the activity, it's no problem, since players can freely drift in and out of the game with no repercussions.  This makes Richochet Robot a good choice for larger gatherings, but risky for smaller groups.

The game that first clued me in just how much smarter than me my partner is. The answer is "scarily."

I'd just chalk it up to my own density, but whenever we've played this in a group the general consensus after the first couple of rounds is "yeah, [my partner's name] has first place wrapped up, the rest of us are competing for second."

I asked how they felt about functioning less as an opponent and more as a timer. Their answer was "*BEEP* ROBOT," which you can interpret as you will.

An excellent game.  It is fun racing to solve the puzzle first.  I like the harder puzzles far more.  It needs to be difficult to find an optimal move.  Otherwise, most of the players at the table will arrive at the optimal move before the timer runs out.  

This is why I don't like the rule that ties are broken by the player with fewer points.  This just keeps everyone around the same score.

Maybe a shorter sand timer would solve this problem. For now, I'll just play that the first player to bid a number gets the prize.  Scores will have a wider range, but this is a game that everyone continues to enjoy even when losing.

RATING: 8
I like logic puzzles and this is one of those. While there seems like some people are always best with this, I don’t mind as it’s just fun to see the solutions. So what if it is a multiplayer solitaire? That just mean that more players can play it together and makes it fast regardless of how many players are present around the table. One other good thing about this game is that players can enter and leave it when they feel and it won’t disrupt the game balance. After a few game you will see how to use your robots effectively, but it’s still fun after that. If I have to make one complaint, the timer is set too long in my opinion.

How do you rate a puzzle?? The game is definetely fun to play but there is not a strategy to develop so if you are good at it you are good, but if you are not very spacially aware there is nothing to help you out. It is a competitive solitaire as really you are not playing against other players.

As a puzzle-like activity, it's fantastic. As a game, it falters because a slight discrepancy in skill level means that lesser players aren't even involved. I mean, I can play Chess against Kasparov and while I'm guaranteed to lose, at least I'm playing the game. But against a superior Ricochet Robot player, you might as well not even be in the room.

I really loved this game when I first played it, but my feelings have dimmed slightly. It is an abstract number puzzle, but it's the kind that anybody can play, and anybody can jump right in.

I'm borrowing this game from a gaming buddy and i'm really surprised by it.  I didn't think that a game where most of the time the players are just staring at the board, not rolling dice, moving counters, drawing cards, etc...could be fun.  I was so wrong!  What i thought would be boring is actually thrilling, as you race with your opponent(s) trying to find the shortest route, watching the little robots ricocheting along their paths in your mind.  It's especially satisfying when you find 20+ move combos involving 3+ robots to get the target robot to his destination.  Great brain exercise that isn't exhausting.

This game is a brain-burner!  I just don't have the knack for it, and often go nuts trying to come up with any solution, never mind a solution that will be better than my opponents' solution.  I guess it's the time limit that really kills me... it ratchets up the pressure, until my head is ready to explode!  (Maybe I just need to stop playing with such smart people...)

That said, this is an interesting game that some new gamers (especially puzzle-lovers) will enjoy.  And I like the self-balancing nature of the score, where a person who's behind in the points wins tie-breakers in deciding who can claim the next point.

Don't actually own this or have a desire to buy, but i've played it enough to review and i'm willing to play it. Very puzzely game that can make you feel dumb staring at a board with 4 robots on it and not figuring out how to move said robot to a spot. Makes me feel even more dumb when someone figures out an optimal path that i cannot see. I wouldn't say i'm terrible or good at this game, and for me to play i need others on my level. Someone dominating this game can break it IMO. That said i see the genius of the design and this is the sort of game that has very little middle appeal. You either love puzzles and programmable movement or it's a convoluted mess and want no part.

This is a wonderful family game, and a good mixer.  I have played it with people stepping in and out (leaving chips on the table of course).  It seems to be more popular with youth, who are more spacially driven.  

The downside, not a lot of depth.  Some don't like the mental gymnastics of trying to puzzle through a move. Also, limited number of people get to "move" the robot, so you can "play" a game without ever touching it (and lose of course).

Un juego excepcional de lógica y agilidad mental, no conozco algún otro que se parezca a su mecánica. En el juego intentas mentalmente llevar a cabo el movimiento de un robot a través de obstáculos para lograr llegar a su objetivo, el primer jugador que lo logre ganará un punto de victoria. 

Es un juego difícil, requiere de memoria y rapidez mental, no apto para personas que se les dificulte o les aburra llevar a cabo procesos de lógica mental. Será siempre uno de mis preferidos, en especial por disponer de espacio para cualquier cantidad de jugadores, sin que esto afecte de manera determinante la duración del juego, que en esencia es bastante corto (20-30 min).

Can be intense as you rush to find a path before anyone else, only to have them say the number a split second before you or to have someone else undercut your number.  I think you need to select your players carefully for this game, as this game will not appeal to everyone.  I only played once and one person left the game because she was frustrated with not getting any points and another person stuck it out but never received any points.  The rest of us (3 players) were having a great time finding the paths.

I liked the game...  It matches my style quite well, as it's more of a puzzle game than a random game...  You need to figure out how many spaces to move the robot to a particular space...  And sometimes that is more difficult to do quickly...

The 'game' definitely not for me.  It's a series of brain-burning puzzles ('Sokoban' on PC anyone?), but I don't want to solves puzzles like that in a boardgame.  It's just boring - if I want to solve complex puzzles, I'll choose to do it alone on PC or paper or sth.

Rules are on the verge of being broken in a few places if you want to follow them strictly.

I don't even think this should be a boardgame. It's a puzzle game and somewhat reminiscence of slide puzzles. What's the point of just staring at a board and basically play a solitaire game of finding the shortest path on the board? Your friends are there to basically be your "timer". Lame.

We stopped playing before the end of the game because I had clearly won - once a software programmer, always a software programmer(I'll admit that my past life may have helped!)

RATING: 6
This is a series of puzzles - in the most traditional sense - that must be completed solo in your head faster than the other players. This should be enough to decide if you'll love or hate this game. For me, I like the structure of the puzzles, they're interesting and challenging. But I just hate timed things, since I tend to think pretty slowly. And it's extremely frustrating in this game when every round you find the solution 5 seconds after someone else, and for that you get nothing. It doesn't feel like it's rewarding puzzle solving as much as it's rewarding speed. But I liked the puzzles themselves enough. If there were some way to do this without it being a race I think I'd really like it.

This might be ok as a solitaire puzzle (pro tip: there is a free phone app with exactly the same puzzle). As a multiplayer game it's horrible for the following reasons:
* No player interaction whatsoever.
* Less experienced players WILL end up with a total score of 0 and hate the game. I.e.  only playable with a group of roughly similar skill level. (The only way to score is to find the best solution in the shortest amount of time among all players. No chance for the new guy in the group.)
* There is no mechanic to influence the game state other than earning score. The players who fall behind might as well stop playing. They can't make any difference.
* Only one game mechanic. Extremely repetitive. Combine this with previous points, and half the players will drop out halfway through.

RATING: 8
Ricochet Robots is simple puzzle game with an irresistible combination of quick and deep thinking. Each time a token is revealed, the mind must quickly analyze whether the solution is obvious or complex. If it makes it past the point of obvious, the deep thinking kicks in and the race is on to find the best solution.

I plan on playing this more in the future - I could see it myself giving a slightly higher or lower rating for this one, depending on how replayable it is.

The first time I played this, I didn't like it much because one of the players was crazy-good at it.  I liked it better the second time.  I think this is also a game that I have to be in the right mood to play.  I find it a little problematic that games can be absolute blowouts if one person is just a half-second faster than everybody else.  It's more fun if you're the one getting all the tiles, but not so much if you're just a bit slow every time.

What a hard game, it is difficult for me to find the paths as quick as other players (as spatial skills are not my forte) but I really like it. It is a bit of a brain burner but one of the best I have played. A nice feature of the game is that you can play it with a lot of people without adding any extra time.  If you are not as good as the other players you can get a bit frustrated (I should know) :S.

I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG recommendation system. Ricochet Robots is a game like no other in my collection and I enjoy it a lot, I´m slowly getting better at it, however this is not a game I would like to play each week but I´m usually willing to play it.

I love the game, so I love this edition. It has some improvements over previous editions (read my thoughts in the other entry). It features more boards (more combinations) and some diagonal obstacles than only change the path of the colored robot, neat!

Not sure if I will buy this edition as I have the Rio Grande one, but if I didn’t had the game, I would buy it right away.

When I found out that the Zman Games edition came with new boards I had the desire to buy it and I finally did. However I was very disappointed to find that in many copies (and mine) the boards didn’t match due to a misprint and, worse of all, that Zman wouldn’t replace them. I get angry each time I see the misaligned boards so I finally sold this edition of the game. I still have the Rio Grande Games one.

I'd rather play this than most other fillers, but I don't have a high opinion of filler games in general.  Can suffer greatly from the "Set problem" of having one person who is much more practiced at pattern recognition than the rest of the group.

This is an excellent competitive puzzle game. The fact that more players is better is also the problem with the game. The more players you have, the harder it is to get a table full of the "right" players. Players must enjoy visualizing alternate paths traveling across the board, and this is very difficult for some people to do. If you can get a group of 4-6 who all enjoy this, the game is an easy win.

Este es un juego que no puede ser considerado como un juego de mesa estratégico (donde tienes que usar acciones), sino como un rompecabezas.

Es algo así como "descubre el camino para salir de este laberinto", pero en este caso, se pueden mover algunos de los muros (robots).

Cada ronda el objeto que se tiene que encontrar es revelado. A continuación, el robot del mismo color debe de ser capaz de alcanzar ese objeto con la menor cantidad de movimientos posibles. Los jugadores entonces empezar a pujar y el que encuentre la mejor solución se lleva el objeto. Para ello los jugadores pueden mover cualquier robot alrededor del tablero.

Reglas simples, sí, pero funciona. No me puedo imaginar a alguien que vea a otros jugando a este juego y no quiere participar.

This is a game that can not be considered as a strategic boardgame (where you have to take actions) but as a puzzle.

It's something like "discover the path to get out of this labyrint" but in this case you can move some of the walls (robots).

Each round the object you have to find is revealed. Then the matching color robot should be able to reach that goal with the minimum quantity of movements possible. Players start then bidding and the one who finds the best solution gets the object. To do so players can move any robot around the board.

Simple rules, yes, but it works. I can not imagine someone who sees a others playing this game and doesn't want to participate.[/color]

This game also seems good for a few laughs. I find it to be a bit of a brain burner, trying to mentally move the robots around to get them to the target as fast as possible. I like the catch up mechanism that once someone calls out a minimum number of moves, the timer is activated and you have a chance to challenge by claiming less moves. Also, if you can make it in the same number of moves and you have less winning tokens you get to get the chance for the win.

One of my all-time favorites. I love this game in that same way that others might love to do crossword puzzles or Soduku. For me it is mental gymnastics and is fun even without opponents.

I don't care, the entire concept just strikes the right nerve with me.

This game tests your ability to quickly and accurately send virtual robots skidding across icy floors, and that too is a valid skill, although this type of visual-logical real-time contest is not why I play board games in the first place. Each round is essentially self-contained, so almost any number of players can busy themselves for almost any amount of time. But in the end it's not very exhilarating or varied, and I'd hate to find myself compulsively bouncing invisible robots off cars and walls as I walk down the street, so better not do this too often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This isn't a game, but a puzzle. I like it, but it's difficult to think of circumstances in which I'd say, "let's have a go at Ricochet Robots".

The puzzle consists of finding a path between two points on the board. The path is constrained to be a straight line until it reaches an obstacle, whereupon it deflects left or right (some obstacles determine the direction of deflection). The setup involves placing a handful of pawns at random spots on the board. These pawns can be displaced (using the same rules) and upon reaching an obstacle can be left there as a new obstacle. The players thus have a limited but vital means of changing the topography of the board.

This game shares some of the flavour of Pac-Man, and has the same feeling of a primitive video game.

Checked it out on Android where you can move around testing pathways trying to solve, then simply reset when it inevitably doesn't work out. People seriously 'play' this in groups? Get together, stare at the board, figure out as many as 20+ moves in their head, until someone declares Bonanza! or somesuch, demonstrates their efficient route, then... everyone starts all over again? Wow. That's some tepid gaming sessions I'm missing.

A disclaimer- my wife and I do not play this game correctly. There is a bidding and time limit element that we leave out when we play. Instead, we more or less take turns trying to solve each puzzle. Whoever gets an idea first tests it, and, if it doesn't work, the next player tries. In the end, we each score chips we have solved, and there is a 3rd pile of chips we have solved together. So this becomes almost a co-operative game for us, and as that, it works very well. Replaying rewards with increased skill almost immediately. After a poor 1st session (using the new diagonal bars), I had instant buyer's remorse. A day or 2 later, we played the simpler version, and it clicked right away. A little different from other gaming experiences we have, but eminently satisfying, and a great mental exercise.

Ricochet Robot is a brain-burner-and-a-half. I can't see everyone enjoying this little puzzle-cum-game, but I certainly do. It rewards a kind of thinking you don't usually find in EuroGames -- spatial thought. One downside is the lack of player interaction, the deathly silence that falls on the players as they begin searching for the solutions. This alone keeps the rating from rising any higher for me, as it's not always that I would want to play a game without talking.

Juego diferente a casi todo, me recuerda en alguna cosa al Set, pero más lento y la gente con la que he jugado no les ha acabado de convencer.

RATING: 4
I have come to the conclusion that there are different levels of players and I fall into the bottom group, fortunately at the lead of the bottom group, but I will never beat those in the top group. It is more of a joint puzzle solver than a game and one that I can leave. For those that do not know it, there are 4 coloured Robots, and 4 different coloured gates. On a turn a tile dictates which Robot is trying to get to which gate. Then against each other you try to fathom a route through the maze which enables the robot to get to the gate in the minimum number of moves. Walls are fixed but there are 3 other robots which you can move to act as mobile walls to help you achieve the target. When someone believes they have solved the puzzle they call the number of moves, others have a minute to try to beat that number. As a solo game it works well if you enjoy puzzle solving, but for the same money I can get a years supply of puzzle books which I can solve whilst having my bath - or laying in my bed, the game does not transfer from the table so well. In group play you will either be one of the 2 people gaining most of the points or one of the others sitting around watching the two puzzle-solvers battle it out so from an entertainment point of view it fails, as a medium for showing who is the best route finder - it succeeds.

Bought from Essen 2007. Oh yes, I like this one. It has a very little "game" inside it, but fast paced problem-solving-puzzles are always nice ones. What you will need is same skilled gamers and then you will have a winner here! Otherwise Ricochet Robot doesn't work at all.

My second favorite game. 
Any number of people can play, they only need to see the board. 
It is fantastic to play on a boardgame and/or role playing convention, because people stop and look, and within minutes they play too. 

I have the revised reprint, which isen't as good as the other versions (I don't like the reflectors).

I can understand the appeal for some, but this visual spacial stuff just makes my head hurt. I just sat there like a ninny...wasn't able to even suggest a way at all. Sorry folks! It's a good game, I can see that, it's not broken or anything, but it's something I would need to practise a LOT to even have a go!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Rated this a "1" since, in my opinion, there's no game here, just simultaneous puzzle solving. The only decision one makes is whether or not to "play". From there you all just stare at a board until either someone solves the puzzle or the sweet release of death saves you from more "fun".

Needs a lot of thinking, and a very fast eye!
There isn't any player limit, and that makes it great to play with a lot of people at the same time!

I brought this from the bring-and-buy stall at GenCon UK 2003 and have had no regrets.  A puzzle with a competitive element it is up to you to decide how much competition you want by how stringently you stick to the timer and bidding mechanisms.  A great puzzle/game for any number of people.  R.R. draws people in and with its quick downtime keeps them hooked which is illustrated by its first play with me and a friend but quickly had attracted four others (none who could be described as gamers).  R.R. also benefits that it can be played on your own increasing the likelihood of it reaching the table and that varients can be easily imagined and executed giving it greater depth and durability.

Objectively speaking, I think this is a brilliant game with different layouts possible and too many possibilities of starting positions thereby making each game unique. However, I find that there is almost zero interactiveness with mostly a ooh and a ahh or a good find, I can't believe I didn't think of that with most of the time spent playing (or thinking) in silence. This is definitely not a game for me.

My friend Jim calls this the sit and stare game. Last time we played it was with his copy at a coffee shop.

The more you stare at the board, the more people want to join you.

This is what makes this a game for me: there can be multiple solutions, some are better than others, and there's a bid to win. Contrast this with Ubongo Duel, where it's a straight race to any finish.

I might rate this higher, but it's the kind of game that flops with new players as often as it shines.

This type of game desperately needs a handicapping mechanism.

really enjoy this game for a lot of the same reasons I enjoy Set.  Though it's very different, I like the real-time game play and busting your brain, and deciding whether or not to call your number (or call "set") before double-checking in attempt to get your call out before your opponent.  Very happy to own this one.

It's one flaw is a few unclear things in the rules.  Such as that stupid angle right up against a wall (just flip that piece over to avoid it) and can you move a robot against a wall, move another, then come BACK to the first and move it in the opposite direction?  Oh well.  I still love it.

When one of the challenges is espeically hard it is just fun to watch someone find the solution and not be competitive about it.  Played only with my husband, so it will be interesting to see if my opionion changes when played with others.

Enjoy the mechanic that helps those behind stay even as long as they can see the same solution as the winner.

Very competitive puzzle game that I wish I could say I always win :(  Everyone is in a path-planning race and the game strongly favors the underdog, which is a bit irritating at times.  The "learning curve" for this puzzler makes it a bit unfair the first time it's played.

Now this is a great coffee game if you have the right group of people! I can see how the "stare in silence, say a number, prove your case" thing won't work for everyone but for me this was a pure delight. Maybe if I play it more I see patterns repeat too much but I doubt I'll get to that point so. A real treat of a puzzle, not so much of a game but who cares when it delivers a great time! Could be played in cooperative fashion just to puzzle with.

Game in a Nutshell: Be the fastest to figure out the quickest way for a robot to make it to its destination.

Played as: 3,4 player, Solitaire online

Pros: Extremely easy to teach and start playing. You can stop playing whenever so it's easy to play a couple rounds to fill some time. Exercises the visio-spacial cortex like no other game can. Scales well from a solo game all the way to as many as people can crowd around the table.

Cons: This isn't a game that's going to be fair at all, and the chances of it being competitive seem slim. One or two people are probably going to be superior to all others playing due to how their brain is wired and others may be frustrated because of this. 

Other: I don't mind playing this game myself, but I don't think I've ever played a game were there wasn't at least one person who was miserable. 

Best Use: When you have a group of people who all love puzzles or there's enough people that the ones who hate this style of game can get together and play something else.

This is a very good abstract game that plays a lot of people.  The major advantage is that everyone plays at the same time.

The disadvantage is that you are all just trying to solve a puzzle with effectively no player interaction.  This is the kind of game I'd enjoy playing on a mobile device, but it's not the kind of thing I want to be playing socially.

It is a good game.  It is a game I can enjoy.  However, I want to play this kind of thing by myself on an iPad.

Small game, only a board with some boxes and walls, 4 robots and a changing target-tile. There you have to bring one of the 4 robots within as few turns as possible. You can activate all the robots. By moving one, he rushes forward until he is stopped by a wall or another robot. Then you can move him or another robot again until the one robot finds the target...
May seem easy, but you are not allowed to touch the robots and try several constellations, instead you have to imagine all the moves the robots do. 
Fast explained, but very challenging. Perfect short game for players in the mood for a little brain activity.

Dazzlingly elegant puzzle-game. Some solutions are actually beautiful to behold. I often mix in the silver bot (without variants) and play mostly solitaire, or at the RR Challenge online. There is such a pleasure in starting a new puzzle, despairing at first of finding any solution at all, discovering a convoluted 19, then gradually whittling it down to 17, 14, 12.

Game where you think how to get the selected robot to the randomly drawn home tile. Once someone sees a solution, they call out how many moves it will take. There is a 1 minute timer that allows others to place lower bids (# of moves). Lowest bid starts. If they do it, they get the point. First to an agreed upon number of points wins.

Probably won't get it. This is a time sensitive puzzle solving game.

A Turbo Taxihoz (útvonaltervezés) és a Swish-hez (agyalós logikai) hasonlítanám, ennek megfelelő a pontszám. Igazából baromira élveztem a játékot (szeretem az ehhez hasonló logikai feladványokat), de nem érzem hogy olyan baromi sokat játszanék még vele.
Ha úgy játsszuk, hogy sokat gondolkodunk, mi a megoldás, akkor egyszemélyes logikai játék gyakorlatilag, amiből még telefonokon is van sok hasonló. De ha azonnal bemondunk egy számot 20-30 környékén (mint én), akkor bizony mindenkinek csak 1 perce van, és mehet a licitálás, kockáztatás! Na így még szórakoztató is!

I used to think this game was awesome...then I realized how one sided it could be and how repetitive it could get. As a mental challenge, its kind of enjoyable...for about 15 minutes or so. Still, nice different little game and I like the idea behind it. Gameplay is fine, and I like how scalable it is, but it hardly excites me.

Its also a bit isolating. At, say, 6p or 7p there will usually be one or two at least who will always dislike it a bit because they are so much slower. Thats just not as fun for them. Maybe if this was a co op of some sort, and players were getting different robots to different goals. Itd be a bit better for that.
Plays: maybe about 5 or so sessions at 10-20 minutes each or so?

My dad bought this game for my brothers and me many years ago, sometime around when it came out. I've introduced it to several board game friends. I would have to call it the most underrated board game in existence. Very few people have heard of it, even hard core board gamers, which I think is a bit of a shame. The fact that it was published before the eurogame fever is more testament to its genius. 

It's amazing for its ability to accommodate any number of players but to also demand intense, sharp thinking from your mind. I'm unsure of anything else quite like it. However, the intensity of thinking required, especially against good and experienced players, will drive away some people. The time pressure and also the sheer matching of mental prowess will be disquieting to some. 

The weight rating of this game is misleading. Similar to chess or Go, the rules are simple. However, the strategy and mental demands are super heavy.

It compares to chess and Go for its ability to allow players to compare the quickness and creativity of their minds, but it does so as a group game.

A puzzle game where you are trying to get different robot figures to different spots on the board in the least amount of moves possible.  When a round starts all players stare at the board until someone calls out how many moves it will take them to get a robot to the designated spot.  After this the left over players have a chance to do the same thing in less moves.  You do this for a certain number of rounds, than compare scores.

I found this game to be quite tedious and boring, especially if you are playing with an expert that does not take their foot off the gas.

With different extra rules this game can be extremely varied. I like to play with robots passing through the outer edges of the play area as though there were no walls, and coming back on the opposite side, moving until they reach a hurdle or another robot.

It's really a multi-player puzzle. It's in the same vein as Set, in that all players are looking for a solution at the same time. It's more ponderous than Set, but still fun for a pattern recognition kind of mind. Add that it's easily played by effectively an unlimited number of players, and it's a great addition.

RATING: 9
(I own the older edition without the black robot and "reflectors" on the other side of the boards)

One of those games where some just are good and others aren't. Visualizing the right answer to puzzles is still fun even if you're not the best player around the table (as long as you win at least one round). Especially if solving correctly some 25+ monster solutions.

Update (15.3.2010) : House rule: At beginning of the game give fifth robot a rule that it will do when/instead being moved. It will obey this simple special rule until it is moved as a part of shortest solution. When that happens the player moving it thinks a new rule for the robot. (examples : Instead of moving: (5.) robot swaps place with another robot, it can move once through the wall, only moves 1 step/move, etc.)

Of course this must be done in the least possible moves and as quickly as possible.

Not so much a game as a competitive logic puzzle. I found the game outstays its welcome- there is absolutely no strategy. It requires quiet and players who are in the mood for intense concentration, and yet there is zero interaction.

Man, what a hard game this one is... you really have to rack your brain, figure a solution real quick, before someone else shouts a number. Because after that you'll have to think even harder, trying to figure how to do the same, but with even less moves.

The beautiful thing about this puzzle-like game is that the more you play, the better you literally become, so in this sense it's a very good excercise for your brain.

It can be quite frustrating at first, but by seeing the more expert players' reasoning you can learn and improve your own way of approaching the problem.

Fun game. Can look and look and look for a solution and then see it all of a sudden, or not.  I like the "slap your head" factor when your opponent smotes you with a bid way lower than yours & you realize the solution was right in front of you.

I think there are probably a bunch of ways to make this even more interesting, once you feel you have played out the regular rules.

Nice game.  It usually takes me a few rounds to warm up, but after that, it's all good.  The last game ended with a very exciting finish as I was tied for 7 tokens each with my opponent (in a two player game you need to go to 8 to win).  He found the solution in 10 moves, then 8.  Then I found it in 6!  What a great game!

A great puzzle game. The time pressure makes this game thrilling and painfully enjoyable! However, it's a type of game that I think requires a certain kind of innate mental ability to do well at, so some people tend to do consistently well at it while others don't.  For this reason, people tend to either really like or really hate it. The card game "Set" (1991) requires a similar kind of ability, although being good at RR doesn't guarantee one will be good at Set, and vice versa.

This is a mildly interesting set of spatial reasoning puzzles which have been jury-rigged into a game by adding a Timer to make it a race to solve the puzzle first, or to find a better solution than the first inside one minute of the first solution.

All the fun of taking the S.A.T. or G.R.E.  This game could produce a short circuit that would leave you comatose.  I believe it should come with a Surgeon General's warning.

RATING: N/A
I have an admitted soft spot for games that could have been designed at any point in history, things that feel like they have no connection to the modern focus on lineages and mechanism refinement. There's an awful lot of overlap in that world, and I'm tired of spending time with it so that I can better spot the microdifferences between games I'll play once or twice. Some people like tracing ideas like that, but to me it feels like prepping for a trivia game that never comes; I simply don't need to know anything about the evolution of deckbuilding or dice placement. No one I game with gives a shit. 

Ricochet Robots is a weird one. As a competitive game it's a bit lacking since there's nothing you can do to directly compete with or influence another player. It's a modular board where you're sitting still, dead quiet, trying to figure out how to get one robot on the board to hit another space purely by ricocheting off of obstacles. So it's quiet, thinky, planned sequencing. You're envisioning boardstates that don't exist, and then performing spatial experiments on them. I don't know of anything like it (other than the Mutant Meeples blatant rip-off), and it's a really cool puzzle game. 

I have played this opposed, and it's OK, but I really enjoy it as a thing I set up in my office and play periodically to get a little logic or puzzle fix. I have a few games that fit this purpose, and they'll likely end up my most-played titles.

Brutal puzzling.  Those that grok will crush the opposition.  It is scarcely a game as there is virtually no player interaction.  However it can fit large numbers of people, players can come and go, and solving the puzzles is fun for some.   I like the system dressed up as a game in Verboten Stadt better, though that game has a lot more randomness and less interesting moves.

RATING: 3
It seems that you either get it or not, and I really didn't get it.  I can understand what you need to do, but I couldn't manipulate the robots fast enough to be even the slightest bit competitive.  Which is fine, but I always thought I was decent at spatial relations - so the whole affair was a giant frustration.  Nevertheless, the design is solid and if you like spatial relation puzzles you owe it to yourself to play this.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

Simultaneous puzzle game.  Also has the advantage that it can be set-up and others join in mid-game.  A good opening game while waiting for others to arrive.  But a little puzzle solving can go a long way...after a few puzzles, game just is more of the same.

the best recommendation i've heard for this game came from a devout cooperative-only guy in my group who said "i don't play competitive games, but i will play this. let's finish and then play again!" family can play this, even after a little wine. sure, it can be a little daunting to play against some people who're really good, but honestly i've found that the competition really hones my play. also, you'll find that players get more and more intensely into the game until suddenly everyone erupts upon seeing some really clever solution. i had ignored this game, thinking it was something else. i had ignored this game to my detriment. play this game. buy this game.

Ben's game. 
An interesting path optimization game, at which Ben and JW are both better than me. Ben is better at this than most people, actually, so it rarely gets played (or played more than once). Additionally, this is another game where my bad first experience (11:30pm: I wanted to go to sleep, Ben and JW wanted me to play with them) has turned me off from the game. 

Edit: After another play, I realized I don't like this game at all. I can see why people do- it's clever, simple, scalable, and attractive- but I don't want to play it.

This is a great puzzle game of figuring out how to get a robot from one square to another in a maze, using the fewest possible moves. Some people are real good at it, others not so. As many people as want can play at once; for each draw, whoever figures out the moves soonest scores. Technically, every single human on Earth could play in one game at once. I think they have an Internet version for that...

Acquired at Oasis of Fun 2010 prize table. One of those puzzle games in the category of "Ready, set, aneurism!" There are four (or five, with the optional silver) robots placed randomly about the map. The map is mostly random too. There are various wall blocks and "targets" about the board. Someone turns over a target tile and off you go, mentally calculating the movement of the robots in your head, hoping no one notices the blood dripping from your ears. Each robot can be moved in any orthogonal direction. It continues until it hits a wall or another robot. The target tile indicates which robot and where it has to arrive at. Players stare at the board cross-eyed and bleary until they come up with a solution in their heads. Someone announces they can do it in X turns, and the timer is turned over. During the remaining time, anyone can throw a number into the ring, or revise their number with a lower number. When the timer ends, the player with the lowest number Y called out demonstrates (this time physically, with pieces and everything) the solution in Y turns. If they are correct, they get the target tile, and you start a new round. If they're wrong, you reset the robots back to their initial positions and the player with the next lowest number demonstrates their solution. Etc. Often you're setting up elaborate robot movements to block other robot movements to cause additional robot ricochets and then someone shows you a ridiculously simple solution. And then you curse them. Play until all target tiles are gone, or until someone gets three, or until someone gets bored. This is a great game for passersby because they can jump right in and join the game, or just announce their own numbers for the fun of it, demonstrating their solution after the round winner is determined. Rating could rise or lower depending on how much I like giving myself a migraine.

UPDATE Dec-3-2010: I always enjoy bringing this to the table. Rising half a point to an 8.

One of our favorites.  It has an instant appeal to computer programmers, but I've found that many people are surprised at how good they are at it.  My wife, who is very un-analytical, can make huge inductive leaps that leave everyone else behind in this game.  It's more of a puzzle-solving problem than a turn based game, so it works well as either solitaire, two person, four person, or twelve person come-and-go.  It's funny to walk in on a large group playing.  Everyone is sitting totally silent staring intently at the board!  It's the polar opposite of games like Taboo, but that doesn't mean that the same crowd won't like it.

RATING: 7.5
Probably the geekiest party game ever – if your idea of a party game is having a table full of people silently staring at a board for a tense minute or two before yelling out a number. But don't get me wrong – I love puzzle-solving games such as [thing=16986][/thing], and sliding puzzles remind me of old Nintendo Gameboy games. Ricochet Robots simply adds another level of brainhurt by introducing a competitive, timed element. It took a few games, but I can now at least claim that I finally got the hang of looking for viable paths.

#9 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

The ultimate speed puzzle game. I feel engaged and challenged each time I break this out. As I've gotten older, I've feared my memory and processing capabilities are starting to lack. This is a perfect game to combat that! You could even place this game on a table at a gaming meetup and allow players to jump in at any time. I have found that it can be tough for some people to play with those that have more experience, while others seem to pick it up quickly. I love the feeling of surprise when you think you've found a great path with 14 moves and then all of the sudden someone shouts "Four!" and you're left dumbfounded for not seeing something!

Some suggest it as a good party game, but it would really depend on the type of party:  If no girls show up and none of your friends are jocks, perhaps this will get the party going.

Gameplay involves staring at the board setup, trying to visualize moves.

OK, I can't stop playing this one solo! It's a great puzzle to try and find better and better ways to get to the target space! I'm rating it strictly on my addicted need to set up the game and play it alone... I'll re-rate it after playing with others.
Just played with friends, the rating actually went up. They may not have liked as much as I did, but I lvoed it!!

It is hard for me to try to rate this game in comparison to other games.  It just doesn't work the same way.  There is a puzzle. There is a race certainly. But there isn't any activity.  There are a number of multiplayer-solitaire, puzzle/racing games out there, but because there really isn't any movement this feels more like a council of removed examiners confering over the concept of a game rather than a group of participants.

It does get a six though because there is a satisfaction in trying to move all the pieces around in your head to make it work.  It is rewarding, but more in a "job well done" kind of way rather that big fun.

This game is simply a lot of fun and one of my favorite games. A competitive puzzle- two great things in one! We play that the smallest path possible is 5 (if someone points out a smaller one, we throw it back and pull a new puzzle- also no doubling back). Another rule we use is that the multicolor puzzle must be done with silver.

More of a puzzle than a game, this is incredibly fun and addictive if you've got the right group of people.

Something prompted me to think of this 'game' 6 years after my only play, so I downgraded my rating to remind myself never to play it again.

The game? Every player looks at a picture, then someone says "I can solve this in 5", then everyone gets a minute to make a better bid, then everyone watches the winning bidder to see if they can actually deliver, then everyone does it all over again.

Cravat, there is a small attempt made to balance this for differing levels of skill (if two people bet the same thing one after the other, the one with less chips can play first) but everyone does NOT have the same chance of winning.  Either you just loose to someone or you just win, neither is very satisfying; So what's the point in playing? As a result I can't rate this highly and it looses at least 3 points. I am aware that this characteristic presents itself in other games I like, but it's just so transparent here that I won't own this. 2009/05/17

People either seem to love this game or hate it.  There's not a lot of gray area here.  You can see where I stand.  This game is right up my alley.  I love punishing my brain with these types of spatial relationship puzzles.  And it's always fun to impress your competitors with a particularly elegant or clever solution.  I've played the daily puzzle of this game at ricochetrobot.com for the last 3 years and I still enjoy it.  It's become part of my daily routine and it's been fun getting to know the community of players that has grown over the years.

This game requires that you play with people that have the same skill level as you do for solving the puzzle. Otherwise you have six people sitting at the table, but really just two or three people PLAYING. This doesn't make the game bad. If you and your friends played some sport with professional athletes it would be a similar situation.

However, when you play with someone of the same skill level, it's really is fun.

Oww - this makes my brain hurt - badly!  But what a great challenge.  There's a guy that played with us recently that just amazed me.  He could literally look at the board for 10-15 seconds and solve any combination - even some where the path took 25+ steps.  I'm absolutely baffled how someone's brain can work like that.  I don't think I'll ever be very good at this one, but I enjoy the challenge.

A competitive puzzle. While that label would normally turn me off, I like this puzzle. The time element creates a lot of tension, even if some of the puzzles are mind-bendingly complicated in the number of moves required to complete them. The major downside to RR is the skill gap between new and experienced players. Someone with a lot of practice can annihilate new players. Be sure to play with evenly matched opponents.

Juego sólo la mayoría de las veces, lo tengo puesto en mi escritorio, con una partida montada y un par de veces al día, busco el camino más corto hasta el punto donde tiene que llegar el Robot.

Cuando juego con más gente (¡no hay límite definido de jugadores!), me encanta ver quien es el más rápido o como es posible que una persona haya logrado encontrar esa ruta que parecía imposible y en menos de 10 movimientos.

Para mi es una maravilla, pero otros lo odian, por eso lo único malo que tiene este juego, es encontrar el grupo de jugadores adecuados.

Tough to say after a partial initial game in which I got worked by my two brothers.  You HAVE to be able to think quick and visualize solutions efficiently.  I really want to enjoy the game, and I think I will after a few more plays.  It is so stark and so bare, it is difficult to see how tough it can be at first.

UPDATE:  OK, it is a very unique game, it has that going for it.  However, if you are like me, and cannot process think at a rapid rate later in the evening (hard for me to do past 8 pm) then it has to be played earlier in the day.  Don't hear about too many games that are "time-of-day dependent", but for me, it is one of them.  I will even avoid games that are played later in the night.  No thanks, I will play No Thanks instead!

Great fun trying to solve the ever-changing puzzles. What makes this even better is the timer, which gives everyone a chance to find a solution. Having a fixed time to find a better one than the first 'bidder' works great for keeping everyone in the game, but not making things impossibly long.

RATING: 8.75
Excellent warmup for puzzle fans.  As with most puzzle races, this one can be dominated by those who can quickly solve visual puzzles.  The timer keeps people in the game well at first, but some people lose interest if they are never the first one done.  We've experimented with some handicaps to even things out as well, with varying degrees of success (mostly based on the interest level of the players).

RATING: 7
I love games that can melt my brain. RR is definitely one such game, there's just a few problems here:
1) There are not many people who are interested in playing this. Or at least I can't seem to find them.
2) This game requires a specific skill or way of thinking, and develops it rapidly as you play it. As a result, there's is a huge difference between a new player and someone who has played a few times. This is very bad for improving the situation with 1).
3) RR quickly becomes too simple if you play it a lot. As a result, me and one of my friends houserule it to provide an extra challenge - we set two, three or (very rarely) four goals at the same time.

4 of the logged plays have used my copy of the game.

Ricochet Robots tem apenas um objetivo: fundir seu cérebro de uma forma deliciosa! Um jogo com regras simples e de curta duração, mas que desafia sua capacidade de raciocínio.

Não indicaria esse board para pessoas impacientes ou sem muita força de vontade para raciocinar (ou indicaria, para exercitar o raciocínio).

RATING: 6
Speaking of my preference for things that are actually board games, Ricochet Robots is just a puzzle masquerading as a board game. It reminds me a lot of Set and Jungle Smart (also known as Crazy Circus), in that all three games pit players against each other as they try to be the first to solve a puzzle presented to everyone simultaneously. The first thing that can tip you off that these aren't really board games as we generally understand them is the fact that players can come and go as they please during the game and it won't have any detrimental impact on the game. If someone wants to leave in the middle, no worries. If someone shows up and wants to start playing, no problem. That makes for a great joint puzzle solving activity, but doesn't really make for a board game as I understand them. The second tip off is that you can play for any length of time you feel like. You can play for 10 minutes or 10 hours, whatever you please. I appreciate designers who finely calibrate the length of their games to the depth of those games, so the games don't end prematurely or overstay their welcome. Karl-Heinz Schmiel seems to be a master of this often neglected, yet very significant skill. He has given us the four-hour Die Macher, the 90-120 minute Extrablatt, the 45-60 minute Was Sticht, and the thirty minute A La Carte, all of which fit their timeframe beautifully. It's a fine line that games have to walk as you can easily feel as if they end prematurely (e.g., Cuba) or overstay their welcome (e.g., Marvel Heroes). Ricochet Robots eschews the entire dilemma. As a result, like Werewolf, it's a group activity that your group may or may not enjoy partaking in.

About [thing=51][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
I admit: I once, and until a few time ago, thought [thing=51][/thing] was a dexterity game in which players needed to flick the bots in order to hit others to order to take them out of the board or to a given place. I truly did. Now I know how wrong I was. Because [thing=51][/thing] only uses the dexterity of the mind, in a very puzzle-y type of game.

There is no luck in [thing=51][/thing], just thought - hard, continuous path-making, number counting, 1000 brain-rpms. A good computer program will probably crush you, so if you are those that don't like games were computers are simply better, well, skip this one.

[thing=51][/thing] is a game for those looking to challenge their spatial awareness, coupled with the time pressure of beating the others to the answer - but it doesn't have to be the "correct" one, just the smallest one anyone could find.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The round starts when a token is revealed and put in the center of the board. The token says the color of the bot that must be moved and also the place to take it. The goal of each round is to take a given bot to a required place on the board in as few movements as possible, considering the bots always move until they hit a wall or another bot. Other bots can be moved also, even if, say, the goal is to lead the green bot, you can move the red and blue, to allow the green to reach its proper place. The person that calls for the smallest number and actually delivers the bot correctly in that number, takes the token.

The bots moved stay in the place they finish. Then another round starts.

The winner will be the person with the most tokens when all of them were taken.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Where to move the bot and if moving the other bots will help (most of the time, it does). Do this as fast as possible.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Nice production value - the tiles and tokens are OK and the bots are neat;
- Straightforward gameplay - small set of rules, easy to teach and to play, with no exceptions to the main rules;
- No luck;
- Can work both as a game for game night, or as a teaching tool.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Playing time is short, but can be extend due to lots of thinking;
- Can be frustrating (more on that bellow);
- With the no luck element, different skills will normally provide the same end result.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like you are in a math contest, doing equations. The chalk hits the blackboard with fury, as you try to do the calculations faster than your opponents. You can't say if they are ahead of you or not. The tension is high. You finish first, yelling to the jury: "Fourteen!" You notice you are the first to speak and are beaming with joy. Then someone else says: "Twelve." You freeze. The jury rises, walks to you both, slowly. Then she extends her hand, to shake the hand of your opponent.

For the most part in a play of [thing=51][/thing] you will be staring at the board, in deep silence, making additions and paths in your head, trying to figure out the best way to lead a bot to its required place. Then this can turn into three possible scenarios:
a) elation: you said a number no one else could lower, and you actually were able to meet what you said and get the token;
b) frustration: you are still crawling your way to the proper place for the bot, when someone else says: "Twelve!". Wait, what? Twelve?! You are still in the "three" and leagues away from the point you want to take the bot to. You then stare at the board, dumbfounded, trying to come up with a miracle, but the added pressure of the timer only helps to make you have even more difficulty to do the task. You accept your destiny and just let it be, frustrated;
c) elation to frustration: you said a number, the lowest one, that you simply couldn't fulfill, due to a mistake. You are ashame and frustrated with yourself.

I get similar feelings with [thing=16986][/thing] and its brothers - and this is why I usually avoid playing them. Not that other type of games don't have these feelings also: when a long-planned strategy fails due to a wrong action/move, I also get frustrated, and when it works, it rocks. However, the frustration usually only happens once, while in [thing=16986][/thing] is an exercize in how much of it can i handle in 45 minutes.

[thing=51][/thing] allows for some great quiet times, and works really well to develop spatial inteligence - a friend of mine used it in a teaching program used in several schools, with big success: it was amazing to see a whole class of loud-mouths kids and teens stop and be silent while trying to finish the puzzle.

Overall, [thing=51][/thing] isn't a game I'm keen on revisiting, but this is due to my shortcomings and preferences than about the game itself, as it works perfectly for its intend purposes, being smart, clean and challenging. It can truly be a total winner for you, in more than one way.

First played this in May of 2011 and it quickly became one of my favorite games. Excellent game, a real brain burner. Every point is hard fought and rewarding on it's own. Even when you lose, you can still feel good about having found your own solutions, even if they were sub-optimal (or you just found them slower). We prefer to play without the catch-up mechanic, and we don't allow robots to "rebound" at all, which makes the game much more difficult.

RATING: 8.5
Nice, clean, fairly short, simultaneous multi-player spatial puzzle, where the time element gives slower players a chance to find a better route.

I don't particularly enjoy the reflectors; I feel they just mess up the clean nature of the game.

Instead, buy both editions (or the latest version which includes all the boards) and mix the non-reflection board sides from them together for lots of variety (486 setups).

Most people in our group don't like this game.  The original owner is extremely good at it which makes it frustrating for them I think.  If you're playing with new players, use the rule where if someone is ahead by a few points and they say a number first, someone else can steal the point using that exact same number to help keep the new players in the game.  Otherwise you may end up like our group where this game is generally hated and vetoed.  It is more like a multi-player puzzle than a game, but even though I never win I love this game.

Ricochet robot's most attractive aspect is that many people can play this game simultaneously and people can come and go as they please during game play. This alone makes it worthwhile to keep in my collection. However, the downside is that this game can become really brainy and bogged down. Not everyone will like this game because it does require a significant amount of concentration. Still, I give it a 7 for being a party-esque game.

The gameplay, such as it is, reminds me somewhat strongly of Set.  Plus, there's one of the more heavy-handed "screw the leader and keep everyone close" mechanics I've seen, where the last-place player basically breaks all ties.

It's not quite as bad as Set- there's much more actual thinking- it just defines a genre I don't care for.

Played:  Many times.  This game is fantastic fun, and a real brain burner at the same time.  Simply a puzzle game, but its ability to play 2 to infinity and the short amount of time needed really make this a must in a game library.

RATING: 6
Brilliant idea. I really enjoy puzzling these out and it's important to have time pressure, but as a game, it's pretty poor unless you're playing people of roughly equal experience/skill at it. Otherwise it can get pretty frustrating as one person  (or persons) always gets them way ahead of the others.

I played the daily puzzle at ricochetrobot.com for several months before it ceased existence, and making the transition to the physical board was quite hard, as my short term memory is too poor sometimes to remember the first half of a solution I'm currently working out. I don't know how I feel about the new diagonal color gates either. They are a little zany.

RATING: 10
This is a WONDERFUL game.  People who don't like games will like this game once they get into it...but you have to have someone teaching it who gives the new players time to get acclimated to it.  It can be difficult until you get used to how to spot moves.  This is a puzzle more than a game, but it's fun either way.  You can play it solitaire, but I don't like it that way...no competition.  There are a million board placement variants as well as variants with additional bots...and by giving bots properties (like nega-bots that cancel out a bot's movement).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is fantastic! One possible problem is that an experienced player can completely dominate a game.  When we play, we remedy this by requiring that the best players look at the board only after someone has identified a solution and the timer has started.

This is a wonderful, abstract, mathematical board game, that will build thinking skills to see many moves in advance. You have to calculate how many robot moves (which are a bit like chess moves) it will take to get the correct robot to the desired square. You can play this with 2 or with a dozen players. Competitively or cooperatively. 

Make sure you get the newer Z-Man edition, because it includes all the previous boards, so you have the most options.

Warning: this is really more of a puzzle than a game, but it's fantastic for building thinking and logic skills for kids, and is good for building chess skills.

There's something about Robot Ricochet that makes me giddy as a school girl.  You can teach the game to a dozen people in 2 minutes or less, than watch them all twitch their eyes and necks counting moves in total silence, but perfect competition.  An absolute classic-to-be.

A great game but just too much of a brain burner for me to play it often.  Basically you're trying to get a particular robot to a particular destination.  Robots move until they hit a barier and then the turn 90 degrees and move until they hit a barrier, etc.  You have to figure out how many moves it takes to get from point A to point B. The first person to see it calls out the number of moves. Then the sand timer is activated and everyone has a chance to call out a number that beats the original.  When the timer runs out whoever called the fewest moves gets to show everyone.  If they're right, they get the token, if they're wrong then the next lowest gets a chance.  It's a lot of fun but don't forget to bring your ibuprofen for the inevitable headache this will cause :).

RATING: 7
A puzzle that masquerades as a competition.  It's a neat puzzle, and the thing that sets it apart from games like [gameid=1198] is an ingenious catch-up mechanism where the people behind can find the same solution as the people in the lead, but they get credit, even if they're slightly slower.  The best player is still more likely to win, but not as likely to become a runaway leader.  The puzzles that players are repeatedly solving are just the right level of difficulty.  Not so long that players start to despair, but also not so simple that it becomes a speed game, or overly simple.  I have to figure that Ricochet Robots  would be almost infinitely replayable.  The final good thing about this game is that it works well with children, particularly ones with a strong spatial sense.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This game is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of players possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots which will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves. There are two versions of this game: Ricochet Robot (the original, in a maroon-ish box), and the reprint Ricochet Robots (in a blue box). Gameplay is identical in both cases, but the Robots version has slightly more involved maps, with reflectors that will affect some colors of robots but not others. The components from the two versions can be mixed and matched to produce many new boards. Re-implements: Moonstar

RATING: 5
You know what I don't understand?  People who can look at a Ricochet Robot board for about ten seconds, and then announce "32!" for a move.  But what's even harder to understand is their ability to remember those 32 moves when it comes back around to when they have to prove it.  Me?  I get stymied when I have a move of 6, but then can't remember how I did it.

I must be a masochist, but I like this game.  I just tend to lose every time I play.

I gave it a high rating because we're likely to pull this game out and just have it sitting around when people come over. It's very easy to attract non-gamers because anyone can jump in at any time and there's no limit to the number of players.

It helps if the players enjoy puzzles..but sometimes the least likely people win!

This is a unique game. Every gamer should have a copy imo.

I think that one has to have a liking for logic puzzles and the like to enjoy this game. What it kind of does is allows people to experience that logic puzzle feel but in a competitive multiplayer environment.
I feel the game plays better with higher player counts and it's a bit of a struggle getting many people who like this kind of thing together. But if you can it can be a great experience. If not then it is still OK with 2.

The game suffers in that if two people are playing and one is so much better at this kind of puzzle then that one will always win so it's best to have similarly matched players.

Well, the mechanic of this game is unique and I truly enjoyed playing it, but if give me headaches, I don't like much the time pressure, the hurry and thinking too much, I need something more easy to play. But, of course, this is the only option to play with a lot of people, and you can make home rules without destroying the fun.

Bueno, la mecánica de este juego es única y de verdad que disfruté jugándolo, pero me provoca dolor de cabeza, no me gusta mucho la presión del tiempo, las prisas y pensar demasiado, necesito algo un poco más sencillo de jugar. Pero, por supuesto, es la única opción para jugar con un montón de gente, y puedes hacerte reglas caseras sin destruir la diversión.

After having played Robo Rally, which is the first thing I'm reminded of playing this, the box and board both look pretty ugly by comparison.  The game itself is extremely well done though but is pretty hit or miss depending on the people playing.

Probably the only game I would consider worthwhile as a solitaire game.

More puzzle than game, which I don't dislike, but it seems to be the ultimate antisocial activity which is very different from what a boardgame is suppose to be.

Fascinating, and at times extremely difficult:  You not only have to solve the puzzle-of-the-moment, but must do so entirely in your head, which has you trying to memorize 17 steps of an experimental attempt to shuffle various robots around, in order to get a particular one to a goal.  ...and speaking algorithmically, discounting intuition, you must use a brute force method to find a solution.  Great material for a newspaper/magazine puzzle, though!

I played this game up to the point of getting sick of it. It's really realy good. We play with our 'high five' variant. At each turn the target robot must touch or pass  near the black (silver) robot (no walls), or the contrary (the black robot must touch or pass near the target robot) so they can do a high five. The solutions are thus a bit longer.

Excellent game. Unfortunately girls are not very competitive at this game (maybe it only happens in my gaming group), and when you get very skilled most of the puzzles are resolved too fast (no more than 20 seconds); in many cases, you will give the solution only a split second before your opponents. Good solo-game (but don&#039;t play it too much that way, or you will never find equally skilled players!).

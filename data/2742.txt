Wings captures very well the history and romance of aerial combat during the Great War. The attention to flavorful detail makes the subject come alive, and results in a very entertaining game. I would much rather play a game with plenty of interesting detail like Wings, despite its relative slowness, than its faster but blander competitors.

Updated 8/13 - Score from 9 to 8 due to the fact that it takes a lot of bookkeeping to play.  It was fun in the short term but over time it's tedious.

Updated 6/14 - Score 8.5 - Good complex gameplay - I think I kinda enjoy the bookkeeping sometimes!

As of this writing, this is my favorite WW I air combat maneuvering game and I've played nearly all of them.  The Exalibur edition is a real disappointment over the Yaquinto original.  Same game but the first edition graphics are far better.

The Airforce equivalent of WW1 air combat.  Huge number of planes and many variants.  Tedious to play but each plane is simulated to a degree not matched since.

I own the Yaquinto edition. I played it a lot some years ago and now play it again with my two sons, 10 and 12. 
A game full of heroic adventures : your crew can pass out, your plane can catch fire or enter a spin. You can fight the zeppelin, throw torpedoes on battleships and slalom between hills. A not so realistic game but so fun !
A lot of optional rules that improve greatly the game and allow you to build your own gameplay by selecting what you like the most.

Supposedly the best WW1 airplane game-- I've played it a couple times.  It is nice and detailed, but a little clunky.  Lots of nice data on the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Yaquinto's attempt at WWI air combat, the only way it knows how--lots of tedious rules and charts. The system appears to be based heavily on the WWII Air Force game by Avalon Hill (both plotted movement games).

Game Played: #20705.

Played this game regularly in high school, the first real wargame I learned.  This is the best WWI air combat game. 
  
Once you've grasped the basics definately add the advanced and optional rules - they're easy to learn and vastly improve the game experience.

A good WW1 aerial combat game...but in my opinion there are better ones. It's not helped by the fact that Yaquinto never published the companion game with the extra aircraft and campaign rules like they promised.

I read the ZOCo review with interest.  Although a reasonably fair and balanced review, wherever complaints were seemingly lodged against the game system, rules or playability, the lacking explanation is clearly linked to the attempt to represent actual period conditions.

For example, the reviewer bemoans the simultaneous movement system and the fact that it's difficult to know what your opponent is going to do.  Isn't that precisely what the pilots of the era had to contend with?  The reviewer does elude to the fact that attitude and the like will help tip you off to a certain degree.  This translates directly into player experience.  If you play the game enough, you will begin to anticipate your opponent's intentions.  Additionally, as you begin to learn how functional or not the planes are, this will add to your instinctual abilities.  Again, the way it should be in my opinion.  

When the reviewer criticizes the fact that you find yourself better off flying off once your plane has taken too much damage to climb and engage, this too strikes me as exactly what should be represented.  Unlike the shooting gallery convention games, this simulation realistically recreates the fact that many engagements ended with pilots fleeing with their wounded aircraft.

These kinds of player experiences wherin you become more experienced and hence, more skilled, are exactly what sets "Wings" apart from other games on this subject.  Personally, this is precisely what I want from a tactical simulation.  

Potential players should know that "Wings", like so many other Yaquinto titles, is not a lightweight treatment of the subject matter.  And if you prefer beer & pretzel shoot'em up games, "Wings" should definitely not be your first choice.

This is a game design that stresses detail and period feel. And it is a game which rewards players for their increased experience.  But admittedly, these rewards come at a price.  The popularity of highly abstract rules systems at game conventions is completely understandable. You strive to provide a quick-playing, fun game for players.  Although I will say that when the game first came out, I used to run it as a miniatures event quite successfully.  But I confess that "Wings" is not a good convention set of rules because of the learning curve required.  It is best utilized as a club event.  It is especially adept as a campaign game.

Yaquinto titles are some of my favorite games.  And I make no bones about the fact that I am biased toward them.  I love the detail of their tactical games, am a big fan of the 'Data Card' titles and find I like the approach of moving miniatures rules to boardgame simulations.

"Wings" is without a doubt, the last word on WWI air combat.

Still the best for WWI air games, though there's room for somebody to come in and do it better. I've done up a lot of home-brewed mods for this one, but the game in the box is sound enough.

RATING: 7.5
For an Airforce/Dauntless player like myself, this was easy to pick up and play. It added more choice to the flying, e.g. the ability to tighten a turn when in a vertical bank. It made a good job of simulating the performance of the aircraft, and our dogfights always spiralled downward as we tried to keep speed up while turning. Some rules added complexity for little benefit, such as the handling of defensive guns, but on the whole it worked well. A map showing the landscape looked good, but the counters were unattractive (although an improvement on Airforce).

The mass dogfight option was a welcome addition, but we waited in vain for the campaign rules to come out.

The best tactical air board game ever. My copy is in tatters from being played.

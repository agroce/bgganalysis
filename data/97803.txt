Suffers from a positive feedback problem, in the sense that the boss cards are the BEST cards and you have to be winning to get them. Doesn't have much staying power, like a lot of cryptozooic games, it leans heavily on its license without bringing anything new or particularly interesting to the table. Mildly fun, but traded my copy and couldn't miss it less

RATING: 1.5
Incredibly unbalanced and the theming makes no sense, so that's a start.  Also, the Light bosses either suck or are brokenly game-winning depending on what you roll.  VP on stronger cards makes the game extremely snowbally, and even then it manages to last longer than it should.

I love the comic strip, I love deck builders, this was essentially a predecessor to the engine Cryptozoic used for later games like DC, Naruto, etc, and while it's not quite as good as those, I still enjoy it, and there are some minor differences. Just understand that it's drawing on a lot of PA references, so you're in this for Mike's art, the humor and a pretty functional game that scratches the basic deck building itch of an Ascension or Dominion.

Based on the IOS app: 

A lot better than I expected.  

Some really good ideas.  Still derivative of Dominion, but the designers have done a good job making this game their own and developing some novel/theme-y mechanics, too.  

The theme is well implemented, while keeping the game playable.  And although the crude humor limits the audience for this game, it wouldn't be a PA game without it.  In fact, a generic gamer theme slapped on this engine would really diminish the experience, in my opinion.

If I had a friend that was a big PA fan, but not a heavy board-gamer I would definitely get this for them.  If they were big into gaming, they would probably own Dominion already and I would be forced to try to convert them to Ascension rather than get this title.

(+) Good job blending the theme (Gamers and the evils of gaming) with the mechanics (rolling 20-sided dice, etc)
(+) Some novel mechanics that I enjoyed (boss battles, etc)
(+) Great game for PA fans, but case-by-case for serious board gamers and the general public

(-) Runaway leader problems (IOS games are quick, but playing in person might be painful for the losing player depending on the length of the game)
(-) Potential balance issues with some cards
(-) Crude humor limits play-ability in general

*UPDATE*
Gaaah!  Can't even play the silly app anymore... the runaway leader problems and the balance issues with some cards are just too much ("Natural Twenty" is particularly obnoxious).  I'd play it with a friend to humor them over a beer or three, but otherwise I give up on this one.

A decent Ascension-esque deck building game. Certainly more enjoyable if you like the PA comic and style. Difficult to explain cards like Touching Wieners and Scrotum to neophytes. That said, you can just play without cards. I feel like game equally supports both sides of gameplay (power attack versus token collecting). Boss cards in either direction and a lucky or decent dice roll often seals the deal and then, the card playing gets outrageous.

The best thing about this game is seeing the initial array of cards for the game and choosing your character knowing what strategy you plan to employ.

The worst parts of this game are:

the positive feedback loop of purchasing boss cards as they are both worth the most and the most powerful cards in the game, so lucking into one early can give a player an insurmountable lead;

the characters, some of which are useless, others meh, some great, and one, potentially, broken.

Basic deckbuilding game - plays like Dominion with the following differences: two kinds of resources (power or money, like Ascension), unique player powers (some seemed amazing all the time, some seemed amazing in certain situations and therefore not so good in other situations), buying the expensive "boss" cards gave additional boosts (helping the winner win more.)

Fast build of deck potency, balanced between tokens & power, (despite power seeming superior, in fact well-played Tokens can slaughter the Power branch).  Boss loots keep things random, names & art are hilarious if you're into that.  Rare potential exists for unsatisfying runaway of people with the first boss loots, but this is reasonably well controlled.  Would be nice to have more bosses, as well as the ability those choosing Power to have the ability to prune tokens out of their deck (multiple options exist for Tokens).

Penny Arcade is basically a hybrid between Dominion and Ascension, that or someone wanted to try and make Ascension more like Dominion.

If you're familiar with Ascension, I'll explain it that way (as I like Ascension and am not overly impressed with Dominion):  Penny Arcade takes the 2 types of resources from Ascension (money/attack) and makes cards require one of these resources like Ascension.  Unlike Ascension, each unique card has a set of 9 copies.  Each game you'll randomly choose 14 sets  of unique cards and place them in Dominion-esque piles.  It doesn't have to be an equal distribution of 7 power sets and 7 money sets.  It's similar to Ascension, in that there are no limits of card acquisition/playing of cards.  Unlike Ascension, cards that you beat using attack, are acquired to your deck and not placed in a discard pile and these cards function similar to the money cards but are worth VP, often give +attack, and can be interactive like the Dominion 'Attack' Cards.

The game can end by depleting 6 piles of card sets.  Unlike Ascension, there are also cards that are the equivalent of Dominion's curses which counts as a stack (despite being more than 9 cards).  The game can also end by completely defeating a boss.  Each game you will use a random boss that can be beaten by attack and another which can be beaten by money.  You need to acquire the cards from the piles to be able to beat them.  When you beat them, you gain a random loot card which are better than the cards you can get from the piles.  After they have been beaten so many times, they will 'level up' and become harder to beat.  After you beat them again a few times, they will level up a final time.  If they are beaten again, the game will end that round.  I think the boss cards are similar to the high cost cards that are available in Ascension except they're always available to be acquired.  Once people start acquiring them, the game quickly spirals to it's end.

The only thing this game really does different, other than mashing the Dominion/Ascension games together is that each player has a unique personality that will give him a special benefit throughout the game (ie +1 money, or a unique card in their starting deck) and has their own starting deck with a different distribution between basic attack and money cards.

This is a decent game.  I personally find it more enjoyable than Dominion.  That said, I've only played this game on iOS, which alleviates the annoyance of randomizing piles and placing them out.  I may have liked Dominion better if I had played it digitally.  While I enjoy Penny Arcade, I don't think it's as good as Ascension.  This is especially true if I were to play PA in the physical version.

Played this combined with its sequel game, and was pleasantly surprised by how good it is.  Admittedly, I'm pre-disposed to like deck-building games, and I'm a fan of Penny Arcade, so I'm pretty much the exact target market here.

Mechanically, it seems closest to Barbarossa among other deck-building games. It uses the same dual economy of money/power, and the boss cards are similar to the objectives of Barbarossa. 

Interestingly, the way boss cards are handled here is similar to the way that the Mastermind cards are handled in Legendary.

A dominion clone with two currencies, basically money and power.  Lots of special actions.  The end condition is victory points, but throughout the game if you have a big turn you can take special boss cards.  It desperately needs some expansions to really differentiate things but overall its one of the better deck building implementations, keeping things very simple and fast which is the strength of such a system.  The variable player powers (you play a character with a little ability) add tons to the game and are a great idea.  I also really liked the humor on the cards, even though I'm not a fan of the website / webcomic, whatever it is.  I'm sure people who are fans will find it hilarious, I got a laugh even though I didn't get half the jokes.

This is by far the best thing Cryptozoic has produced, I would play again, and I'm interested to see what else comes out for the game.  I wish Cryptozoic didn't have shill accounts rating the game to boost its' BGG rank.  This one is a fun game and stands on its own.

This is a legit deck-building game. The Penny Arcade art and random humor are present in spades, and if you like that stuff, the game will appeal to you.

By comparison, the Thunderstone base game came with 8 monster types for much greater variety, and variety really is key for this type of game.

Nice Dominion-style deck builder with a humorous theme and a neat deck randomiser (which decides what cards will be avaible during the game, or not); there is player interaction, but in a very moderate dose (and there are ways to counter the PvP attacks), so overall the game has a friendly, light feel. The boss loot system is interesting and well worth gunning for. Overall, the game is not as simplistic nor lacking (as some of the others comments, imply), but it's clearly designed to be easy to pick & play out of the box - if you know what a deck builder is and how it generally works, you already know how to play PA. And that's a good thing - when you pick such a theme, building a deep, intricate game would be a mistake - ppl are playing it just for laughs anyway :) A good no-frills deck builder.

Clever tongue-in-cheek theme on the deck building mechanic.

I love deck-builders, and enjoy the utter sillyness of the game, but take issue with some of the mechanics. The high-cost "boss loot" cards not only provide a lot of VPs, but also tend to come with very powerful effects. So there's never any reason to not take a boss loot when you have the chance, and there is a smidge of a runaway-leader feel. Also, the character cards (you choose a character to start with) and the boss-loot cards don't seem to be at a very consistent power level.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2013)

This is my first approximation to the Penny Arcade Universe, I’m not sure why, but I just heard of them recently. 

This game have no new or innovative mechanics, in fact the mechanics are very similar to Ascension, HOWEVER, it has the potential to be my second favorite deck building game (after Dominion) just for the fact that it has a static card offering (like Dominion), for me this is essential as it is fair for all players and open the way to optimize your strategy independent from the luck factor. I dislike the way other deck building games (Legendary, Ascension, Thunderstone`s Dungeon, Resident Evil) handle this issue as the card offering is variable inducing a very high and uncontrollable luck factor. 

The bosses in the game are very fun to play with, but they add some (unwanted for me) randomness because each reward card is different. As the cost to defeat them is high, I generally accept them as they come. At least the cost of defeating the bosses is (usually) the same.

Another very good point, the cards are hilarious, it is great when you play a Scrotum :D. Also the game is very easy to teach and learn. I hope an expansion add a little more meat to it with harder decisions. 

Bottom line, Penny Arcade: The Game - Gamers vs. Evil is a good deck building game, it is less strategic than Dominion (which is why I continue to love Dominion) but it is a very fun game to play. If I was a fan of Penny Arcade, I believe I would enjoy the game even more. 

One of 2011`s favorites.

I imagine this is what Dominion must be like with Boss Fights added in. The game is pretty basic and all the cards are pretty much built around getting more power of coins, and in the end this just doesn't make a very interesting game. Sure some of the site gags, and the humor in the game can be funny at first, but after that you really have to have a game that has more meat to it. I will quote the old Wendy's lady "Where's the beef?" Nothing is particularly wrong about this game, and it works rather well. The problem with this game is that nothing really excites me about it all that much and it just ends up being flat out of the box. Thunderstone still rules the roost when it comes to DB games.

Box has been opened but never played. Cards have been sorted and stacks of cards organized into a "sleeve pack" to prevent scattering (cards are not individually sleeved, the stacks of cards that are used in the game are simply put into sleeves to keep them all together). This should make it much easier to quickly setup a game since cards are not scattered everywhere and you can just grab the packs of sleeves you need and start up.

Just like any other Cryptozoic Deckbuilder, this is yet another Ascension rip off with barely any interesting mechanics and tries to pretend the game has depth with it's "dual currency" system.  Most of the cards simply give more of the same currency, so you buying cards for the sake of buying more cards instead of making an interesting decision or going for a strategy.

Avoid it.  Get Quest for El Dorado instead

3 / 5 - Good.

Oddly, although the Penny Arcade theme is completely wasted on this largely abstract effort, I've enjoyed this more than other deckbuilders. It's just more vibrant and exciting although there's still plenty of strategy to judge by the number of games I've lost.

In a way, this feels more streamlined than Dominion because it does away with the action and buy limit. I also like the boss mechanic, even though it may increase the luck factor.

It certainly is a good game, but I see no reason to choose this over Dominion except for the theme. For me that's not enough.

Another deck-building game. There doesn't seem to be a lot of depth but for what it lacks it brings a good sense of humor along with some cool twists. It's got good interaction with PVP cards that attack players, of course these can be blocked. Additionally, there are two types of currencies and in this edition cards require one of those currencies (some of the expansion cards require both). What's really great though are the boss cards. Blind decks of cards that cost a lot but have very strong powers and are worth the most points. I found it refreshing that each boss card is unique.

I must say that "Touch Wieners" is a great card and hilarious. You play it and everybody else who has one in there hand can play one too -- each player receiving an additional card draw.

Nice, silly, Dominion-like deck builder. The market is randomly generated but fixed for your play. Two separate currencies on two separate markets and end game boss characters (which are also powerful cards). This can lead to the rich getting richer, but it's quick enough to not get out of hand.

I wouldn't seek this out, but it's available very cheaply (I paid a fiver) and worth it at that price.

Also a shame that the box is so big for the amount of cards. Clearly they were hoping it would lead to many expansions, but just one 'hard to get' (read: not worth the price as it stands) combinable second base game (with another oversized box) means it stand fairly hollow on my shelf.

Edit: Someone finally sold a cheap copy of the other game on eBay so I have a complete set now (which still only half fills the insert :().

I like this set a bit more than Rumble in R'lyeh, which I played first. If you enjoy this system, it's worth getting both for the card variety. I could see this system being a great introduction to deck builders if it wasn't for the adult content. Still, this is quickly becoming a guilty pleasure game for me. It takes Dominion and turns it into a bit of an abomination, but I like the result of it. I only wish some of the playable characters were more interesting and unique.

I own the IOS version and it feels like another Dominion clone done wrong. It builds upon Dominion and Ascension and failed to capture the essence of both. It became lost its deck building elegance from Dominion and became clunky. The two resource mechanics favor power instead of coin. The PVP aspect doesn't add player interaction. I can see this game is made specifically for the fans of the web comic.

Above all else, this game is boring.  A deck builder where almost every card is money and victory cards are incredibly powerful.  It's boring with a touch of runaway leader and a little pure luck thrown in for no good reason.  Also, there are not very many cards to choose from, and many are in play each game -- combined with how similar the cards are to each other, there is not a lot of variety.

Less strategic but more fun version of Dominion. Also kind of a cross between Ascension and Dominion. Pulling off crazy turns is fun, and you don't have to worry about your deck getting weaker just because you're taking victory point cards. Boss loots add a fun element, and I prefer them to Provinces. If the other players aren't playing well, Penny Arcade can have a runaway leader problem, but it is short enough that I don't mind.

This game does not add much to quickly crowding deck building pool of games.  However, it does refine and rearrange some things that have already been done before.

The most simplistic deck-builder ever. In a bad way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A deck-building game that blends the static setup of Dominion with the resource dichotomy of Ascension and the boss fight end-game condition of Legendary.  The neatest thing to me about this game is how there are two "bosses" that you can defeat to win the game, one with the money resource and the other with the power resource so two entirely different courses of action can still race for the end game since neither one seems to have better cards overall than the other (though one may be better in a particular game's setup).

I love the references to the Penny Arcade comic (which I also love) but the cards themselves are kind of uninteresting which overall makes the game kind of uninteresting.  With so many great deck-builders out there I recommend most people (even fans of the online comic) pass on this one.

Another Dominion/Ascension derivative; there are two types of currency, Tokens and Power, which buy green and red cards, respectively. Attack cards (discard, get a [-]curse[/-]PAX Pox etc.) are all red. The novelty is that there are green and red "boss" piles, face down, which start out costing 8 and go all the way to 13. The boss rewards are substantial and the game ends with one of the 13-cost final bosses is taken.

Green boss rewards have a varying effect based on a die roll: on a 1 (fumble) your opponents benefit; on a 19 or 20 you get something spectacular. Some boss rewards are simply better than others, which -- even without the dice -- injects a hefty dose of luck into proceedings. This might be tolerable if not for the runaway leader problem.

Barbarossa used a similar "boss deck" concept, but in a more thematic way, the deck representing the army's march on Moscow through progressively more-valuable cities. This is worse in every way. A waste of time -- and I am a Penny Arcade fan so I do get the jokes. I can only imagine how abysmal it would be for anyone else.

I really like deck builders ever since I tried Dominion.  Penny Arcade seems like Dominion with training wheels.  There are no restrictions in how many cards you play and how many you can acquire into your deck.  Also, cards worth victory points with the exception one actually do something, so you're not stuck with a deck of VP cards and fail to draw anything that can do something.

PA is a light deck builder that is a pure deck builder.  You acquire cards to put into your deck and some of those cards are worth victory points.  When the game ends, just count out the victory points and whoever has the most wins.

PA does have some interesting features.  Each player is a different hero.  Each hero has a different starting deck and powers.  Depending on what hero you are playing, your strategy would change to take advantage of your hero's unique powers.  

The two types of currency to buy gamer or evil cards is an interesting twist.  My first play of the game had different players taking different roads to victory.  Even though we went in totally different directions, the game ended up being very close.

Although I prefer heavier deck builders and games with some higher complexity, I like PA for what it is.  I enjoyed playing it and would play it again.

All deckbuilders face a hurdle of finding something to distinguish them from the rest of their genre, since otherwise they are basically thematic re-colors of a potentially over-familiar game. You'd think as one of the earliest entries to the genre back in it's day, the PA game would have an easier time of this, but... it does not. The big "innovation" that seemed intended was to rather than have aggression and currency, essentially have two forms of currency that both double as aggression as well, but for different stacks of both market and target cards. If it sounds interesting... it really isn't, frankly? The game seems to want you to feel like it's a strategic choice if you go for one currency, the other, or a mix; but really the obvious choice is to lean one way and just splash the other. The game is pretty easily broken... due to the fact you put bought cards in your hand, I was able to make what was damn near an infinite combo, where one of the most expensive cards could damn near pay for another copy of itself. Essentially, a game with dull concept and broken mechanics and lacking in the humor you'd hope for, I can't recommend.

Goofy and fun. Deriviative of Dominion, but encourages more diversification, it seems to me. That's noble, but not really what I look for in deck-building; I enjoy imposing order over the chaos with deck-thinning, specialization, and interactions. I could be wrong, though-- it certainly took me a while to figure out what the hell I was doing in Dominion. Might give it another try.

As a deck-builder, it shares some things in common with Dominion and Ascension at the same time.  Like Ascension, the game has two currencies, one to buy things, and one to battle things, but instead of having a fluctuating set of six cards to purchase, you're purchasing from a static set of 14 cards, like Dominion.  The addition of the bosses is different, and doesn't even mimic the boss decks of games like Resident Evil or the DC Comics game.  Instead, the bosses grant prizes, which are added to your deck.

So far, I'm not sure what to think.  I like that there are two sets of bosses, one for each currency, but I wonder if that will grow stale over time.  It levels the field if you choose to pursue one over the other, but it might also level the field so much that it's difficult to get an advantage in the game.  We'll see.  So far so good, though.

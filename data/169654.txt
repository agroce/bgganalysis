Deep Sea Adventure is a tiny game that fits in a box not much bigger (width/height) than a credit card. When I got the box in the mail, I was disappointed, but there's a great filler inside this tiny box!

I have really enjoyed playing Deep Sea Adventure (it's our go-to filler) and have even come to learn that there's a little more strategy/decision-making than their first appears in a competitive dice-chucker. 

You are your opponents are divers, hoping to strike it rich with some treasure pulled from the ocean floor. Unfortunately, you're all [I]poor][/I] divers, and are forced to share a submarine and air supply while you're diving. Treasure is your goal, but it also sucks up your air and slows you down as you try to make your way up to the surface!

The game is played in three rounds, and the person with the most treasure at the end of the three rounds is the winner. No kidding, this game plays in about fifteen minutes and is quicker and easier to set up than Hey! That's My Fish -- another of our filler favorites. 

You can do a whole lot worse than the $20 Deep Sea Adventure costs. We've found it to be a fun and engaging filler that's perfect for vacations, restaurants, and casual play. Deep Sea Adventure is a fast-paced yet competitive press-your-luck game that plays quickly and provides enjoyment for gamers and newbs alike. 

My rating for Deep Sea is a nine: this is a good game, and a very good filler game. Like any game, you'll probably burn out after 40 or so plays, but still, what more could you ask of a good filler?

LIKE: A wonderful gift. I really enjoy how players are competing for a limited supply of air resource. The dice randomness adds fun unpredictability.

DISLIKE: The submarine is small to see. Competitive players will only allow short sprints in each round, making it difficult to grab the deeper tiles.

OVERALL: For a family game, it's fun! A light filler.

What it does, it does very well. A straightforward push-your-luck wonder. The mechanics are so streamlined and so clear - and the theme integrates extremely well. It can be explained to and played by anyone. And it is quick and thrilling. So much packed in such a small, lovely box. A winner!

RATING: 5
Push your luck type of a game in which you really cannot push. At least with 5 players the winning strategy was basically just to grab a treasure and swim back in one or two rounds at the latest. It might well be our group thinking but going any deeper or picking up two treasures was basically suicidal because everyone ran out of oxygen in two to three rounds and since swimming up with treasures is more difficult than diving down, you have to reserve at least one more round to swim up than what you spend diving deeper. I would probably do some balance fixes to this so that the end would come so quick and we would see more players going deeeeeeeep.

But I really like the idea and the basic mechanic. Just little tweaks to the balance would be in place.

Love the small box.

It comes in a dinky box and has cute pieces, but the game packs a punch considering it's so simple.  Essentially it's a push your luck game with screwage and a bit of randomness, but that all just adds to the fun.  It's much harder to get back to the sub with more than one piece than you might think.

Cute little push your luck game. It's very fast, it has a nice theme and it does deliver some tension. However I don't think there's much in this little box to keep me coming back to it.

Nice but nothing to write home about.

Not amazing. Looks nice and plays reasonably well, but I feel like the rounds are a bit too short to really give you enough time to feel the dread as you're coming back up. You feel like you're going down maybe 15 feet, 20 feet at most. Like yeah, you might still drown, but it's not very glamorous that you only went down that far and it's a bit pathetic if you don't actually make it up.

Double the length might be just a tad too much, but expanding the length and the air tanks by 1.8X would probably make the game really achieve the panic of trying to run a great distance, while the meter just keeps shrinking. But I'm not sure I want to buy a second box to test that out.

A game that has that enjoyable balance of pushing your luck and looking to screw your fellow players over by deliberately depleting the oxygen supply. The adventure is always thrilling as you try to decide whether you'll dive deeper, get more treasure and hoping you'll make it back to the sub in time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple dicey push your luck game.  It's a nice idea that the players are all draining the same oxygen supply and are able to accelerate its consumption through greed or malice by loading up with treasures.

This game has a high cuteness factor.  Like all Oink games it is compact but well made.  The English rules are reasonably well written, though lamentably silent on whether divers should all return to the sub at the end of each round.

A group of poor explorers hoping to get rich quickly heads out to recover treasures from some undersea ruins. They're all rivals, but their budgets force them all to share a single rented submarine. In the rented submarine, they alll have to shore a single tank of air, as well. If they don't get back to the sub before they run out of air, they'll drop all their treasure. Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.

I almost feel strange giving this a great review because it's such a tiny box and simple concept. That said, it's a beautiful tiny box, and a brilliantly-executed concept. It feels like there should be a solution for not dying at the bottom of the ocean, but it's interactive enough that it doesn't seem to be the case. Punish your friends for pushing their luck, but whoops, maybe you are carrying too much as well...

Six-player game.  

First round: Nobody realizes how quickly the oxygen gauge goes from 'safe' to 'zero', everyone dies.  Fine, this happens at times.
Second round: I go last, pick up a single treasure, and immediately return to ship.  I am the last player to do so successfully, and three other players die again.
Third round: Repeat second round.  I spend a single turn going down, and immediately return.  

I won the game.

It felt like a push-your-luck game where I had zero opportunities to do so - I obviously couldn't stop on turn 1, and if I hadn't "stopped" on turn 2, I would have busted.  I might as well have not even been there.

Excellent small box 'press your luck' game, the first I've tried of the Oink titles and from what I've heard, it's among their best. The visual aspect of the game is lovely, and the rules are simple, but as that air supply dwindles because you're carrying treasure chips along, the game gets pretty tense. Great stuff here, you can teach it to anyone, and one of the better games I own with a 'roll and move' mechanic.

Great push-your-luck filler where the chances of success are dependent on your decisions, the roll of the dice, and the decisions of those other idiot greedy divers who just had to go for a bit more treasure. 
Gets extra points for the small box - there's no wasted oxygen in there, which seems apt for a game in which players die from asphyxiation.

Fun push-your-luckage - but, at least with 4/5 players, the win seems almost always to go to the early player who turns round almost immediately and returns to fight again.  Pushing your luck = death, almost without fail.  Which seems to me to defeat the object.

Yes, it's a tiny game from Japan that has a lot of love poured onto it by gaming hipsters.

Does it warrant it? Well, it kinda does. It's an excellent push your luck game about greed and death. It is when I play anyway. Pick it up if you can find it but no need to pay lots of money for it. It's also a great game at that awkward 6 player count too.

Deep Sea Adventure is a tiny Japanese import that packed a big boat (well, submarine) of laughs in our first few plays. In this simple rule set, easy to learn, push-your-luck game players share a sub and air tank (cheap, poor saps) who dive for treasure. The more one collects the more air consumed and the slower one swims. Make sure to turn back early enough and get back to the sub or you escape with your life as your treasure drops to the bottom of the deep.

This is a fantastic game with a tiny footprint.  The press-your-luck is high with this one, as is the ability for one player to screw over the others (both good qualities).  But it's all worth it when, against all odds, you make it back to the sub with an armful of treasure!

Push your luck where players are all going underwater to pick up treasure with a shared air tank.  Once the tank runs out, anyone still underwater loses their treasure to the bottom of the ocean. It's roll and move and push your luck in an elegant design. I don't love the game, but it is a short bit of entertainment.

Push-your-luck games are not among my favorites and adding on the randomness of roll-and-move makes it even worse.

Deep Sea Adventure is so shallow that it hits the bottom as soon as the game begins: basically it’s a push-your-luck game where pushing your luck makes no sense, as taking risks doesn’t yield better rewards but a sure demise.

There’s not even a single relevant decision to take over the whole game as it kind of plays by itself: the only source of fun here is lingering along the trail with as many treasures as you can grab just to watch the other players hurry to the safety of the submarine, hopefully in vain.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
This one is more "thinky" than you would think.  It is a push your luck game, but the push your luck element has a huge factor on how greedy your opponents are as well since they share the same "air".  I enjoy many push your luck games, and have played a bunch, but this one felt very different.  One I would like to try more at different player counts.  Seemed to work well with 3 players so far.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game is amazingly fun and tense. The push your luck element comes from deciding both how deep to dive before turning back, and how greedy to be, as the more treasures you're holding the more air you use and the slower your movement. All the while you're weighing that against how deep others are diving and how greedy they're being. Plays slightly differently with each player count, because it affects how quickly the air will get used. I enjoy it best with 5 or 6 players. This light, puck your luck filler feels like a classic.

This is a very good filler game in my opinion and is my go to filler. It's quick, easy to grasp, and fun. Sure the roll of the dice can screw you randomly and statistically unfairly... But did you really need FOUR god-damned pieces of treasure you AIR-HOGGING DOG FART!!! The choices you make aren't what will decide if you win or not, but your choices do decide if you CAN win or not... Maybe... Or the dice/air-hogging players could screw you. I don't know, but I do enjoy playing this game.

This is a light filler that is the most fun push-your-luck game I can think of. And it is so thematic to boot. 

Our group is SO greedy trying to dive deep to get more valuable treasure and all end up running out of oxygen and not making it back up to the submarine.

Our group howled in laughter playing this.

Wow. What silly fun.

The only roll and move game that is this much fun. Possibly the best roll and move ever. 

Presented in a super small tidy little attractive box with nice components.

Can't say I cared for this; it struck me as a typical Japanese minimalist design - a clever idea executed in a simple way, but which left not much of a game. Because of the odd way your movement "drafts" off other players, there is only one decision point in the game - when to turn around - and generally there is only one right answer. It's not really the push-your-luck game it appears to be because the actions of the other players really dictate when you have to return, and there is no possible upside that could be worth the insane risk of leaving the pack. Once you've made that relatively simple decision, you're just at the mercy of the dice. I can see that this would have some appeal as a featherweight activity/game and the game's chrome is appealing, but for the hobbyist gamer - even a social gamer - this is closer to LCR than a real push-your-luck game. Doesn't mean it can't find a niche, especially for gaming with kids.

Really fun for such a simple, light game.

This is a push-your-luck game where you're essentially pushing your luck based on how far you think the other players are willing to go.  Once other players start picking up treasure, more and more air starts being used.  If you find yourself too deep or too loaded with treasure once the air starts depleting, you're screwed!

I can't imagine a group I wouldn't be able to teach this game to in a couple minutes and be having a good time.

Treacherous little game, where greediness gets punished. Bigtime. The goal is to get treasure from underwater and get it aboard, but treasure also reduces the limited shared amount of oxygen. More treasure carried -> faster depletion. Staying alive is a challenge in itself, heh.

Seems to be a very nice push your luck game, but with srewage and interaction.
There seems to be a lot of luck too. With the dice but even more with the treasure points
A bit expensive for what it is!

RATING: 10
The tension in this game is about the question of when to turn back. You have to ask yourself, have I collected enough treasure to challenge for the win and is there enough oxygen for me to go deeper?

Add to that, your opponents who are going to be jerks about the whole thing. If they've gone too far, they will take treasures just to use up the oxygen faster. If they are closer to the submarine than anyone else and guaranteed to get back, they'll take up treasures to score more points and to use up the oxygen faster. 

How do I know they want to use up the oxygen faster and not just trying to get more points? Because when they are one away from getting into the sub with a couple of treasures in hand, they are muttering, "roll snake eyes, roll snake eyes."

As for the presentation, the box size is perfect. I bring the game with me almost all the time because it is tiny and I always have room for it. And in play? Gorgeous. Austere. Perfect. Even the meeples are minimalistically awesome.

This was my very first gateway game during my rediscovery of the board game world, and I wouldn't have had it any other way! One of the fastest set ups I've experienced, and also the quickest clean up. The portability of this game is probably one my favorite things about it, however I do wish there was a more organized way to keep all the pieces inside. Overall. this is an awesome luck, strategic, and slightly competitive multiplayer game to play quickly.

A cute little push-your-luck game with a cheeky twist: you're all pushing your luck together.  You and the other players pull oxygen from a common pool as you dive into the ocean and search for treasure, then try to get back to the surface before your air runs out.

Pour aller chercher des trésors au fond de l'eau, il faut plonger. Et il faut de l'oxygène. Evidemment, les meilleurs trésors sont au fond. Si j'y vais, je vais devoir remonter. Mais aurais-je assez d'air ? Car les autres joueurs, en plus de me pomper l'air, ils pompent sur la réserve d'oxygène commune. Donc si je suis trop gourmand, je vais couler. Mais si je n’y vais pas, j'aurais que des trésors pourris. Ahhhh le dilemme !! Deep sea Adventure est un petit jeu minimaliste japonais de "stop ou encore", joliment désigné, et où on va détester quand un autre joueur va dire "je prends le trésor".

Fun for a half dozen plays or so, but games tend to play our similarly each time. Unfortunately a single player's actions have too great an impact upon the game, forcing everyone else to follow. One player who turns back forces everyone to turn back or die. Too bad there isn't a subtler effect--there's just not enough impetus to go deep, since you know the risk won't pan out. Needs a variant rule tweak to push it over the edge.

A fun push your luck game trying to mine the most points from the depths of the sea. The production value on the game is top notch but the gameplay is mostly mindless filler. Would have picked up a copy but it's a bit more than I want to spend for something so light. Really needs higher player counts to make it fun.

[15 Dec 2017] - 6.5 (4 plays)
I like this as an easy game that I can pull out with people who don't play lots of long games and teach them. The game offers lot of chances for players to poke each other with threats of turning around and starting to consume air. The more players there are, the quicker the air runs out! I like the small box size as well for a quick game like this. It's easy to throw in a bag or coat pocket for play on any semi-flat surface.

[28 Dec 2017] - 7 (5 plays)
I was able to teach this game to 4 new players in a matter of 10 minutes and complete a whole game in 25 minutes, which included a number of dessert table runs. The stress of being in the middle of the cycle and making the decision to continue down, hoping for a lower role, was reported by a number of the players. While some of the game may be difficult to get just listening to the rules, one round and the rules are firmly understood by all. Given the small size, this is now one of my regular goto games to bring to parties and social gaming events where a quick game is needed.

I usually hate push your luck games as being too simple, but this one seems ok. While there's definitely no deep skill in it, you can usually get good probabilistic feel for what's going to happen. Plus it's fun to laugh at your friends who got too greedy and couldn't make it back to the submarine without drowning. Every roll takes air from a group supply, and you can roll once on your turn so turns go fast. Thus, there's very little down time unlike some push your luck games where each player goes through some whole process on each of their turns. Its definitely not a game to be taken seriously, but it's a good way to spend 10 minutes for other players to become available for something bigger.

Deep Sea Adventure is a nice little push-your-luck game. It's greatest strength may be it's tiny footprint which makes it a game you can play nearly everywhere. While there's quite some luck involved, I never had the feeling that my moves were meaningless. Someone has got a lot of potential valuable treasure? Well, pick up some more treasures and use up their oxygen. It feels like there's always some kind of counter strategy that might or might not work depending on the rolls of your dice. It's fun!

Players are diving to recover treasures off the ocean floor.  There is a fixed budget of oxygen that the players share, and the more treasure the players carry, the quicker this oxygen burns out.

Superbly high-quality yet minimalist production from Oink Games (Japan).   The big treasures at the bottom of the line are quite tempting, but unless everybody agrees to work together, you will surely die trying to claim them.   That works fine until one player falls to the temptation of grabbing earlier treasures, then everybody else is screwed.  And that's the game in a nutshell.   (It's basically a dice-driven version of Diamant/Incan Gold).

[thing=169654][/thing]  is a gem.  Think Incan Gold but with an added twist.  You are deep sea diving for treasure with a limited amount of air which is shared amongst your fellow divers.  You go treasure hunting in the deep sea and at some point you need to turn around to come back up.  You have to make it back up to the submarine before you run out of air.  Unlike in Incan Gold, where if you decide to turn around you instantly get home with your treasure, in Deep Sea Adventure you have to roll your way back up, and the more tresure you carry the heavier you are, the slower you rise up through the sea.  This leads to a wonderful game of push-your-luck tension.  Is it worth going down for one more sparkling treasure or start heading up now?  And as the air runs out the tension mounts.   

A great game, good for the family, good as a fun-filled 20 minute filler and excellently packaged in the smallest of boxes with brilliantly simple artwork.  The Japanese versions of their own games are always packaged so perfectly.  Lets hope it gets picked up and the design is kept in tact.

RATING: 8
This is a light-weight, push-your-luck, roll-to-move game that comes in a tiny box.  Players are treasure divers that share the same oxygen supply from the same submarine.  The game is played over 3 rounds in which players roll dice to move and decide when to pick up treasures.  The more valuable treasures are deeper, but carrying treasure slows your movement and uses up more oxygen.  

Players need to decide how much treasure to pick up and how deep to go before returning to the sub.  However, keep in mind that all players share the same oxygen supply, so other players' decisions will have a great impact on your own plan.  Do you play it safe and return quickly to the sub?  Or do you push your luck and risk running out of oxygen?

Don't let this small box game fool you, it packs a lot of fun!  If you're not opposed to the luck of the die roll, this one is highly recommended as a quick and fun filler!

One of the best fillers I've come across, and I generally am not a fan of fillers. Fast playing, easy to learn, and fun press-your-luck mechanics make this a great casual game for me. Also, the best use of roll-and-move that I've come across so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Brutal push-your-luck microgame. The game is played over a number turns per round with 3 rounds in the game. On your turn you decrease oxygen (based on what you're carrying), roll the dice to move (decreased by what you're carrying), and grab treasure where you are (or drop some off if the treasure had previously been grabbed). Basically people go out and start grabbing stuff and between oxygen going down and having stifled movement, people die very frequently. The thing that bothered me the most was that the 1st round is almost inconsequential.  You can't really acquire good tiles in the first round because they are too far away and the ones that are close enough, probably won't matter too much to your score over the next few rounds. Definitely other games I would prefer to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A surprisingly enjoyable push your luck game. Very simple decisions (only 'when do I turn back' and 'do I puck this treasure') actually make quite an involving game, with the usual hilarity that stems from push your luck failures...

RATING: 6
The way the game mixes press your luck, and player interaction (via air supply), is brilliant, and can easily catch players off guard. This plays to the game's strengths and prevents it from growing too simple or intuitive. Each round escalates very quickly as picking up treasure accelerates the reduction of air while also slowing down the divers. You can easily teach and play this gem in twenty minutes.

RATING: 6
A quintessential game of push-your-luck with a semi-cooperative element of group brinkmanship. Since all players share a common pool of air, you have to consider how much air they're using up before deciding how deep you want to go. Can you convince others to go with you? How far do you dare go if everyone else is bailing early? Conversely, do you want to start using air up to try and kill other players? 

The other killer here are the dice because you can't count on what you're going to roll (sometimes higher is better, sometimes actually worse) but it's a filler so you can't expect too much control here. 

Sit back, go for the good stuff, and see if the dice will cooperate. Even if you die horribly and lose you'll have some laughs.

RATING: 9
A fantastic game by Oink where you and your friends traverse deep into the sea for treasure. However, the more treasure collected, the more air you lose. The risk of taking more treasure also makes it more difficult to get back, so odds and the luck of the die are your only options for survival. 

It's a wonderful game for kids, too! My 6-year-old son absolutely loves it, and somehow, he defeats the rest of us pretty regularly. It's a great way to see how it quickly teaches kids statistics and odds. 

For the price and how easy it is to travel with, I can't recommend this game enough. One of Oink Games' best.

RATING: 6
Press your luck games are not really for me, but this one is the best that I've played. I like that the players determine how much pressure is applied, I like how different it feels for different player amounts. I really like the small range and distribution of possible dice results (2-6 with a bell curve); probability management is the main drive behind these types of games and I'm shocked at how few games use reasonable distributions. 

The one thing I don't like is the distribution of points on the tiles. It's fun to have them random, but there's a big range of points on every level, which also means that the later tiles can give a bit too many points. Sure, there needs to be a reason to dive deeper, but a roll just on the edge between 2 areas can be a difference of 7 points. It's also annoying to land on blank spaces multiple turns in a row, but that's not really a fault of the game.

RATING: 7
A very elegant push your luck design with the theme well integrated, in a tiny box that punches above its weight. Plays equally well with all player counts.

Sadly the component quality (Oink first edition) is not ideal - after a dozen or so plays the treasure chits are peeling. Bought April 2015.

RATING: 6
Components: really good components in a small box
Complex: really easy to learn
Weight: party/ light
Players: 4 or 5
Length: less than 30 mins
Mechanics: roll the dice and pick up treasures
Decisions: just have to decide if you pick up the treasure and if you are going back to the boat
Opinion: funny filler game, could be a party most of the times depending on the group, but could be a more tense game if players start to think on probabilities. Roll the dice, move your pawn and decide if you pick up the treasure. Then you have to decide if you go back to the boat or continue down for better treasures.
The point of the game is that you need oxygen to survive, and there is a common pool for all players... no oxygen and you will die. You move with treasures, you consume oxygen, moreover, you will move less...
Funny filler that can be explained in 5 mins and played in 20, and can be played almost everywhere

this game was awful ... we died like every round ... on the last round one person made it out with 1 little piece of treasure 

we were all like .. "did we play this right?" "This was a waste of time" etc.

I have no idea why this is on the hotness chart at the moment ...

There is no reward for pushing your luck like in other games ...in this game, unless you play it super safe, you are absolutely going to die.

They might as well have titled this game "the first ten feet of water under the boat" ... and how are you finding treasure before you get to the bottom anyway?

An enjoyable little game that works well with the right crowd - this is a bit deeper than it looks and paradoxically comes across as a bit boring to people who think it's just a roll the dice and move game.

What a great push your luck game! This one is about diving for treasure to get valuable (and heavy!) loot. All players share one oxygen tank so they can coordinate or backstab based on it.

Deeper loot is better, but it's heavy and there's a long way up. 

The presentation and components are lovely as well, and I really like the loot pieces. The more sides it has, the more valuable it is.

We did get better at it as we went along, and I get that is is supposed to be hard. I do want to play it again. I really love the components and the tiny box.

RATING: 3.5
There's just not much game here. You can't choose how deep you go, you can't really tell what each point chip is worth except that one type is theoretically better than another and unless you pay no attention at all there's no actual danger of running out of air. The end result is that every decision feels blindingly obvious and victory is simply te result of better die rolls.

My brother likes this game, so that we had to play it...

I had my doubts that this would be a game for me and man, this is like a collection of things I dislike in games. It looks like a prototype, it's random and doesn't offer much of a game, as there's no depth.

Oh well, just get away with this!

This game is just a fail for me, everytime I played it we all ended up dying.

There is nothing fun in the fact your actions are dictated by the others.

If 1 guy decides to haul a ton of treasure, you nearly never make it back unless you stayed very close to the sub.

the mechanics just don't appeal to me.

Deep Sea Adventure takes the time-old tradition of simple push-your-luck games and adds a clever twist which elevates it - tying the players' fate together. Divers delving downward are doing so at the expense of a shared tank of oxygen -- which means that every decision made is one that is at once personal and collective. Even better, the collective decision vacillates between competition, collusion, and collaboration. Carrying more treasure means less movement, as well as sucking back more oxygen from the shared tank (making it more difficult for you and, more importantly, anyone else to get back). The stakes raise every round so dropping treasure on the first round doesn't mean you're out of the game! The twist is just brilliant -- and like with other Oink games, there's a lot in just its aesthetically pleasing little box.

Played a three-round game with three other people and really enjoyed it. We were all new to the game and everyone suffocated at the end of the first two rounds. We all survived in the third round, and the winner picked up one treasure.
Went to buy the game and didn't find it in a FLGS nearby. Amazon said it could arrive two months later. So we could play in the meantime, we opted to make a copy using cardboard, color, and clay. With our oversized version we've played a couple times since and really enjoy it for how accessible it is (needn't put a lot of thought into it) and for the emotional roller-coaster of the push-your-luck element.

Deep Sea Adventure reminds me of Dungeonquest: measuring your greed vs luck against others in a quest for treasure.

The deeper you go, the more others can squander air on the way back to the sub - this is definitely interactive in a neat way.

I like this as well as any of the Oink Games- a neat and straightforward little game, with some depth.

Behind a friendly exterior hides a really dark game about hurting other people, and drowning. So much drowning.

An interesting gameplay mechanic is that, once you think you've pushed your luck too hard (typically because of a very high die roll), then you can give up, and start taking actions that hurt the other players: If I am drowning here, the rest of you are drowning too. Time to take a 4th treasure!

So much of the game is down to the dice, and the dice of all the other players, that really, the games is about goading the other players into pushing a bit too hard and laughing maniacally when they do.

If you enjoyed throwing people in the volcano in Pompeii, but wish it was shorter and deadlier, this one is for you.

RATING: 6.7
The game is very simple to teach/learn and plays in 15 minutes. It is a game of push-your-luck and live with your choices.

After a few plays though (or maybe even the first), you realize the key to not losing badly is to move down twice, pick something up, and then turn around. Rinse, repeat, and whoever has the best dice rolls/secret numbers tend to win.

So if you play with the same group of people over and over, this could wear itself out. However this game is very cool to show to new people, so if you're constantly playing games with different people this is a must-have, especially considering how tiny the game is!

This is like Diamant/Incan Gold, in that you're pushing your luck trying to get better and better treasure, but if you push your luck too far, you don't get anything.

Deep Sea Adventure is a take on luck-pushing mechanics with a unique feel. Whereas many games in this genre can pay real dividends for playing aggressively, Deep Sea Adventure brutally punishes players for pushing their luck even a bit too far.

While this is what makes the game stand out, it is also what makes it frustrating to play at times. Most rounds tend to devolve into "get out quick, grab one treasure, and grab one or two on the way back." As a result, it can turn into a game where rolls of the dice are more important than having a keen sense for when to escape.

Still, it's a quick and easy-to-learn game that brings a new feel to the table - and I respect that.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2017)

Many friends rave about Deep Sea Adventure so I had to play it. I knew it was a light game and I had fun playing it, still the game is not for me.

The rules of the game are very simple. You can explain them under 3 minutes. Playtime is around 30 minutes.

The theme is cool and the idea of the game works very well. I really like the shared oxygen concept mixed with the “push your luck” mechanism.

The game´s components are good, still, I feel the game is rather expensive for what comes in the box. I was expecting a big game for the price and I got a very small one. I think the price is due to the importing process as I believe it comes from Japan.

The game´s decisions are pretty easy. You roll a die and you move, then you have to decide if you will pick up the treasure or not. You also have to decide when to return to the sub (the only important decision), and that’s it. If you are carrying treasure you move more slowly and you spend more oxygen. It is pretty simple, but it is a fun game with the right crowd. 

Luck is very high but I don’t mind much because it plays fast.

Bottom line, Deep Sea Adventure is a light game, too light for me. I feel it has obvious decisions and low replayability. The luck factor is through the roof and the player who plays the safer moves will likely win, a weird thing for a push your luck game. I will sell it ASAP but it can be a good family/casual game, perfect to introduce new gamers to our hobby. My desire to play it again is low, but I would play again if requested.

Decent little game. Can be a little too luck based due to dice rolls. Also, it's very easy to get a little too greedy and end up with nothing! That aspect of it definitely kept some of my group from really enjoying it.

2015-07-26 - First impression: This is a neat little push-you-luck game where you are diving for treasure. As you pick up treasure, though, you use up the group's oxygen faster and make it more difficult to make it safely back to the sub. This gives the game a bit of a learning curve, though, because it takes a play or two to get a feel for how deep you can go. We had fun with this one.

2015-07-20 - Dropping my rating from a 7 to a 6. It's a fine push your luck game, but I'd rather play other examples of the genre.

Deep Sea Adventure is a really fun game.  I'll start by saying it's WAAAAAAY smaller than what I thought it would be, but big things come in small packages.  I really like the idea of having a modular board and how carrying treasures "weighs you down" in a way, meaning your trip back to the submarine is slower and also takes up more air.  It's really a push your luck game all the way.  Deciding to go further down into the sea or turning back to the submarine are crucial decisions that make this game great.

Push-your-luck game in the mold of Incan Gold, where your choices can affect the risk/rewards that other players face. In this one, everyone shares the same oxygen and if you don't get back to the ship before it runs out you get nothing that round. The family enjoys this one. It lacks the potential bluffing element that Incan Gold has (as in, artifacts only go to those who manage to leave alone), but I'm pretty sure if you enjoy that one, you'll like this as well. 

The reason I score this a point lower than Incan Gold is that the amount of points available in the 3rd round of play can make the points acquired in previous rounds feel negligible. That's a weakness. It's the exact same reason I don't care for Alhambra, but for some reason it doesn't bother me as much here.

RATING: 7
As press-your-luck dice games go, this gives you a good little punch and a great number of components in a very tiny box.  Your greed will be put to the test as you basically trade treasure for time and air to return to the ship.  We've left many tasty treasures at the bottom of the ocean being only one space shy of getting back before running out of air.  While it is an easy to transport game, I wouldn't go getting it out on an airplane or something. There are alot of pieces and the path of treasure does require a bit of table space.

- There are hardly meaningful decisions to make as several aspects to the game are random. I only ignore this issue in regards to push your luck games because the emphasis of the game is luck.

Fun game for everyone. Super easy to learn and fast to play. One of the best "press your luck" games ever!

I love the overall design of this game. I pretty much bought this just because I love the Japanese style of graphic and package design. It's simple, modern and it doesn't have any unnecessary parts.

I love this game in many ways and the only thing that concerns me might be replayability. I feel that the best strategy is pretty much discovered after only 2 plays. And when the people and I are all polite when playing this, there's not much excitement as we were all playing it safe and want to make sure everyone gets back to the submarine in time.

Deep Sea Adventure is perfect for what it is. A light push your luck game with an interesting theme. The game takes about ten minutes to play, and has a really great balancing mechanic in the game. The further you push, the more treasure you take on, the slower you will go. Which is not only thematically correct, but is also makes the game as interesting as it is. Getting back to the sub is pretty hard, but is rewarding when you get there. The graphic design is well done, and speaks to the publisher's Japanese roots. I don't know if I need anymore games in the same line, but I am glad I picked up Deep Sea Adventure when I did.

RATING: 6.5
Quality presentation. Very travel friendly. But honestly, I feel like the balance is a bit off. There really doesn't seem to be enough freedom for players to explore and 'play' the game. It feels too easy for players to not make it back to the boat if they venture further than the 2-pip tiles (especially in the first round). Perhaps the oxygen tank should have been larger to allow for a bit more of the 'adventure' that the title of the game implies, and more time for players to 'get a feel' for the game in the first round. From my experience after the first round, most people either didn't grasp the concept because they didn't get a chance to do much, or they feel deflated after having achieved absolutely nothing. That feeling it multiplied of course when nobody at all makes it back (it happens a lot). Needless to say, we then get that awkward moment of 'Another round anyone?'. I do want to like it, but it feels as though the devs at some point focused more on the 'cleverness' of the design and forgot about the fun-factor. Somebody else put it very well; it's a push your luck game that does't let you push your luck. That pretty much sums it up for me. Weird.

This was game of the month for me. What a great, fantastic and simply brilliant game. Everyone we played it with really enjoyed it. It is light, quick but has enough depth to the decision making to exactly fit the length of the game. 

None of us are any good at it mind. But I just love the way the game plays you all as you find yourself groaning as the first diver starts nabbing treasures in their grubby mitts and, with their extra weight, starts breathing heavily, consuming your collective (soon to be rapidly decreasing) oxygen.

The mix between co-operation and individual play works excellently. You find yourself making bargains with other divers to push on deeper. When it comes to your turn you might find yourself rolling a 6 and heading down into the dark depths alone, realising how far you have gone you turn around to see your fellow divers silhouetted in the shallower, lighter waters above filling their pockets and heading back up leaving you with the knowledge that you are now very unlikely to make it back to safety ... and if you are to make it back it will have to be with empty pockets as you can't afford to carry anything that might weight you down.

The mechanic where the sea gets shallower after each dive works very well as well, encouraging you deeper with each of your three dips of toes in the water. None of us had made it down to the fabled seabed where dropped treasures are said to accumulate in mysterious piles of three. I said none of us had ... that was until the last game when one brave soul was last seen to make it down there before he disappeared in the dark waters that encompass the seabed. He never made it back and was never seen again.

After playing this three times in one day, with two and then three players, I love it. It's probably the most interesting push-your-luck game I've played.

I especially like how difficult it can be, and that it's kind of a game of "You've doomed us all!" When someone takes a treasure before they really should, it shifts the whole group into a different mode (or at least it should; anyone who doesn't shift is likely going to run out of air). My first game, with two, we both scored zero at the end of the game.

There's a layer of "playing the players," which I also like. Who's going to grab treasure too soon? Will she gun it for the sub, or pause for treasure just to drain the air for the rest of us? It's full of moments like that.

Add to that a charming -- yet effective -- presentation, a small, durable box, and simple rules, and this is a winner. I love that it's absolutely no bigger than it needs to be; that plus supporting six makes it a great travel game.

Having played at low player counts, I'm surprised how well it works at 2 and 3. But I can't wait to try 6. I think it'll actually make it easier to score, in some ways, because everyone will be leapfrogging and clearing out the line.

I played this with my partner in Japan when I got it (2-player) and thought that it was terribly boring. So much so that I didn't play it again for a year. 

The next time was with 3 players and it made quite a difference. We had a blast playing this - I think the game really needs more of a party atmosphere.

Jumping over other players gives you greater range and incentive to push your luck while making it dangerous to be the one too far from the sub when others are turning back. Great little package - probably one of my favourite push-your-luck games (overtaking Diamant).

Collective push your luck game of greed under the sea.

There is a basic strategy that will almost always triumph if other players are reckless, but if everyone plays with the 'best' strategy, then the reckless player can run away with the game.

I really like this little game.  The theme is great, the art and components are simple, but beautiful.  It's quick to teach and plays in 20-30 minutes.  The only tricky part is that it's very easy to fail in this game, which makes sense for push-your-luck, but it's often too easy for EVERYONE to fail, especially with new players.  Having said that, I kind of enjoy that moment in the round when everyone starts counting spaces and switches from "We have plenty of time!" to "Uh oh, I'm doomed."

Deep Sea Adventure is, as a friend of mine said, a game about drowning. That makes it sound very unpleasant, when in fact it is the opposite.

I have no idea how much it costs, but probably less than a gigantic Eurobox thingy with ten times the wood and 10 percent of the fun. This is shouty and stabby and push-your-luck fun, especially late at night when other people are tired and would prefer that you shut up, but no, it's a convention and we have every right to scream obscenities at the person who just used the last of the oxygen so he could get his stinking treasure into the submarine.

This game puts the "fun" in "drowning," which is literally false because of the obvious reason but also because there is no "f" and no "u" in "drowning," for reasons that probably made sense a long time ago when somebody with no sense of humor was making up words.

Quite a fun press-your-luck game with some nice double think.  Is he going to return to the boat or not?  Just one turn more?  Just one more treasure?  We were all very greedy, and my last dice roll was one short to prevent drowning, so out of fifteen chances to score, only James managed to survive with a whopping two points.  Very nice, compact box.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/e2DnwZwSXnQ

Deep Sea Adventure is a push your luck game about diving for the most valuable treasure. You do this through roll and move but as soon as you pick up treasure two things happen, the shared air starts to deplete and it becomes more difficult to move. This is a game of exquisite timing - when do you grab the treasure? How far do you go? For such a little box to go up to six players, be highly portable and have a game there is incredible.

Jeu push your luck vraiment sympa.

Les joueurs jouent 3 rounds, celui qui aura ramassé le plus de trésors gagne. Il faudra aller chercher les trésors et les remonter tout en ajustant l’oxygène commun au groupe.  

Préparer le sous marin- avec 25 oxygène quelque soit le nb de joueur. Il y a 4 lots de 8 trésors de valeurs variables. Disposer le premier lot (donc les plus petites valeurs) face cachées et aléatoirement à la sortie du sous marin, ensuite le groupe 2, 3 et enfin le 4. Les trésors ont des valeurs différentes. Lancer les 2 dés (face D3), avancer son pion de couleur du nombre exact de cases indiqués par la dés (- le nombre de trésor deja detenus par le joueur, ex: si le joueur `2 tésor et roule 3 en points de dés il va se déplacer 3-2=1 case), s'il y a déjà un autre joueur sur l'une des cases comprises dans le jet des dés, alors ne pas compter cette case. Le joueur s'il tombe sur un trésor peut le ramasser en le plaçant devant lui face cachée sans le regarder, s'il tombe sur une case ou le trésor a déjà ramassé (pont) rien ne se passe. Il passe les dés au joueur suivant. 
A son tour

1) Il faut déclarer si on poursuit la quête au trésor en descendant plus profond ou si on remonte. Une fois qu'un joueur a décidè de remonter il ne pourra pas redescendre jusqu'au prochain round. 
2) Réduire l'air commun, en fonction de la quantité de trésors détenus pas le jouer actif, (1 trésor= -1 oxygène, 2 trésors=-2 oxygène...) 
3) Lancer les dés et avancer son pion du nombre exact de case.
4)Explorer. Quand on s’arrête une case il y a 3 possibilités.
A) Ne rien faire
B) Prendre un trésor, face cachée sans regarder et le placer devant soi et le remplacer un 'pont'  chip.
C) Replacer un trésor.

Les trésors sont révélés quand il n'y a plus d'oxygène dans le sous marin et seulement si le joueur a réussi a rejoindre le sous marin. les points sont comptés en additionnant les valeurs des trésors. Les joueurs encore en exploration ne révèlent pas les trésors et les place face cachée empilés pour former un seul trésor à la fin des gros trésors, il sera possible de les récupérer dans les rounds précédents. 
Au round c'est le joueur qui a ramassé le plus de trésors au tour précédent qui commence. Celui qui totalise le plus de points a la fin de 3 rounds gagne.

Fun little game!  Played it with different number of players.  With 6, it becomes very difficult to score points as soon as that first player picks up a treasure.  It then becomes a scramble to get up to the submarine.  It created a think tension as players scrambled to get back :).
With 2 or 3, the game runs smoothly and doesn't feel as tense.  
Overall, a great filler game to play between those long intense games.  Highly recommend

Extremely annoying with 5. Seems like I really couldn't push my luck past 2 rolls down. And if that's really the case, I don't really have choices to make. Even if I didn't get a treasure, my opponents will still make it so I can MAYBE only grab 2. It's all up to the dice. There are no choices here.

Great light game to get things started. It is heavily reliant on luck, so if that’s not your jam, you might want to avoid this one. However, there is a slight bit of strategy involved. Only problem is you won’t figure out those strategies until your second play through or if some kind soul tells you.

RATING: 7.5
Excited to get this one as it looked like a light fun push-your-luck game...but it fell a little flat after initial plays.  Not enough oxygen - even with three - to do much of anything, and with a dice range of 2-6, anything more than 2-3 treasures is near certain suicide.  It certainly bears more plays, but it wasn't the instant hit I was hoping for.

Great art and components as are to be expected from Oink Games.

[b]Deep Sea Adventure[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm just not a fan of how this game plays out. For a push your luck game I've found it to be too punishing which sucks all the fun out of the game. It can be funny to watch your greedy family and friends drown on the way back to the sub, but when this happens round after round it gets old fast. Since you share a common pool of air you can suffer just as much as your greedy friends even if you're trying to play a bit more conservatively. I much prefer Diamant (Incan Gold) since you alone are responsible for how far you want to push things before getting out of the temple with your treasure. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Can be taught in under a minute, plays quick.
- Small box packed with some nice components and is easy to travel with.
- Potentially a good, light weight family game depending on how random you like your games.

I definitely got caught up in the hype with this game and got a copy as soon as it was available in the BGG store. I thought this game would replace Diamant/Incan Gold in our collection, but so far I'm less than impressed. I really don't care for the shared oxygen mechanic because all it takes is one player to completely screw everyone else over. I'm also not a fan of the randomness found in the die rolling combined with the random points distribution on the treasure tiles. Also Diamant plays up to 8 and is still very fun, Deep Sea caps out at 6 and I really disliked the 5p game I took part in.

I would recommend TROLL over Deep Sea Adventures if you want to try a push your luck game published by Oink Games.[/i]

Deep Sea Adventure is a simple push-your-luck microgame. Reward tiles are arranged in a line, with the "deeper" tiles being worth more (though their exact values are obscured). Players begin with their pawn at the surface, and roll two d3 to move, skipping over spaces with other pawns. If they land on a tile with an unclaimed reward, they can take it, but each reward they take gives them a -1 penalty to their movement, and reduces the communal oxygen by one at the start of each of their turns. At some point, the players can turn around and head back up to the surface. If the oxygen runs out before one or more players get back, those players die and the treasures they were holding go back to the bottom for subsequent rounds. There really aren't too many decisions in the game, and it's really easy to get screwed over just because of a bad die roll or even turn order. The game can overstay its welcome as well. There are better short push-your-luck games out there.

I like that there is a strong narrative, but concerned there may be too much of a tactical motivation to use up a lot of oxygen and 'kill' the others.

Deep Sea Adventure is another entry in the cute-but-mean genre, and another beautiful production. Like Incan Gold, it's a push-your-luck affair of deciding whether to venture on for greater rewards or turn back to keep what you've got. But instead of being able to get out instantly, you have to fight your way back up before the collective supply of air runs out. Very clever.

RATING: 5
Very very light game that verges on the nonexistent. First group of tiles should only be picked up on the way back as their value is overall too little for carrying 'outbound' with the oxygen penalty. The luck of the die rolls for movement combined with the variations in tile values make this game a bit too random for me. OK to kill 10 minutes but nothing I would purchase.

Our play of this game had a player who couldn't grasp that fact that we shared oxygen.  As a result, nobody survived.  I know that isn't exactly the games fault, but the design ALLOWED for this kind of stupidity.  This is a poor design, in my opinion.

Although this game might go over better when not playing with retards, there wasn't enough there for me to consider playing it again.  It's a pretty simple-minded push-your-luck game and there are plenty of other games like it that I think are considerably better.

I expected more from the publisher.

The game is a press your luck game with far too much luck and too little pressing.  There is a lot of randomness beyond your control, and many turns spend doing nothing because you cannot move.  So, for a genre a bout quick tense rolls, this one is slow paced, plodding, and unsatisfying.  I like the shared pressure of oxygen and how the O2 pressure changes based on what other players are doing, but not on how little my response to that pressure matters.  Flipping up good tiles and rolling high is what matters most, and you have few opportunities to even respond to swings of luck or catch up if you fall behind.

A game of tiny size but very original and accomplished. This game measures the degree of greed of players, and it does in a very fun way.  
Because of its size and its simple rules, at first look it  seems a childish and easy game, but nothing is further from reality: to die is very easy, and it´s very difficult to return to submarine with any treasures. Everyone at my group of board games love it, and it´s one of our favorite little games.

Don't play this with 6 players - total randomness.  But I have no interest in playing this again with fewer players to find the fun.  Can't Stop is 100 times better as a push-your-luck game.

Update: Raised my rating from 5 to 6.5.  It's definitely better with 3 players.  Still not a lot of choices to make, but it's an ok push-your-luck filler as small player counts.  The Adventurers is basically the same system (move slower when carrying more treasure) but without the randomness of being affected by other players using up all the air.

I'm not sure, now after several plays. I think there might be the same game flow/turnout.

Round one, everyone dies
Round two, one person picks up one treasure, everyone else dies
Round three, everyone pushes and the person who picked up in round two wins. 

Even at two player, I don't know I think it seems to follow the same sort of trend.

Fun little push your luck game in a little box. Very cute. Go deep sea diving out of a submarine and get greedy trying to pick up treasure and then more treasure. But will you make it back to the sub? The more treasure the divers carry the more oxygen they use from the collective supply. So the gaming trick is to try and judge how far yu can go based on how much treasure they're picking up and how much assistance you'll get hopping over their spaces. Throw in a healthy dose of dice rolling luck and you've got a good laughable romp. Worth it for the schadenfreude alone.

RATING: 7
In a cliché movie scene, a motley crew is trapped in an enclosed space. One of them eventually panics and begins ordering the others to stop breathing in order to conserve air. This is pretty much Deep Sea Adventure in a nutshell.

What's interesting here is that the game's timer is largely influenced by the players. Players can venture as far as they can, but the clock starts ticking down once someone picks up treasure, and then it's a race back to the submarine. There's even a sense of progression throughout as the path gradually shortens and valuable chips become more accessible.

There are two caveats though. First, if a player has ventured too far when the tipping point is reached, then she is condemned to helplessly watch on as the others scramble back to safety. Second, there is less room to maneuver around when playing at upper player limits. As the air supply does not scale with the number of players, conservative play is favoured as air runs out extremely quickly. But despite the flaws, this game has gone down well with my group. You may not make sense, but we still love you anyway!

[i]Quick tip:[/i] This plays best with 4 players. It also plays well with 3, but we house rule it to start at 20 air units.

Played a full 6p game and it was brutal - very easy to run out of air, especially with our group that delights in screwing each other over.

Deep Sea Adventure has been compared to Diamant/Incan Gold, but it reminds me of Infiltration. The virtue of this game is that it's quick to play and dead simple. But the title is a misnomer; there's nothing deep inside the admittedly beautiful box. Calculate how likely you'll be to survive--this is not at all difficult--and roll dice to see if you do. That's the game.

1 play, 4er

This is a fun little game! It's a tense little push-your-luck roll-and-move game of diving to collect treasure. 

The players all share an O2 supply, marked on the boat. The treasure chits are in a line descending towards the ocean floor. The backs are color coded into several VP ranges. The best ones are deeper, of course. You roll a modified d6 to move, skipping over occupied spaces (so traveling in a pack is better since you help each other move). You have to go down, grab treasure(s), and make it back up to the boat before the O2 runs out, which can happen surprisingly quickly! You need treasure to score VP, but every piece you carry takes away some of your movement! When the O2 runs out, everyone still in the water drops all their treasure (placed at the bottom of the line, I think?). 

Each round (of 3?), people keep pushing downward until someone finally thinks the O2 is too low. When they turn back, almost everyone else SHOULD do so as well -- or risk being stranded trying to claw their way out alone! There's a lot of tense fun packed into a tiny little package here!

Cute push-your-luck filler where players descend from a submarine to collect treasure. Carrying more treasure consumes more oxygen (from the supply shared by all players), but the best treasure is much deeper and much riskier to get.

The English rulebook is horrible.  It shall be rewritten from the ground up.

A typical minimalist design - but I prefer Bunte Runde with similar design and feel.  

My first game play is not satisfying, we may got some rules wrong and we play with 6 players.  However, I don't think I would like this game even if we got every rule correct.  This game has too much luck for my taste, even though I generally like dice filler games.  Don't want to play again, I would rather play another round of Diamant.

Good idea for a push your luck game but the distribution feels like it fails to deliver. The dominant strategy from my games of it was to just jump in and grab a ton and deplete the oxygen as fast as possible so no one could go far down and anyone who did would be stuck. Getting two or three tier 1 or 2 pieces seemed much better than going for a single 3 piece.

This is a fun little game! Clean, simple ruleset, some luck of the dice and mixes a 'push your luck' with a 'screw you' in a setting that fits surprisingly well.

Doesn't have a lot of components, but those it has are of good quality. Really liked the game, hopefully an English copy will be put out. Will be on the lookout.

Great thing is I can see it play well with kids, non-gamers and gamers alike. In other words, VERY family friendly.

[UPDATE OCT 2015] Bought an English version in Essen. Played this with my wife, plays great with two and the theme matches the mechanics so well.. you're literally rushing back to that sub, feeling dragged by too much weight carried while air is running out... rating revised upwards by 0.5 point.

[UPDATE NOV 2015] Brought this to a 10 person Gamer weekend and it played well with 2, well with 6, was requested and replayed even as we all tended to die due to the cutthroat nature of our group. Great, great package, sheer strength of this minimalistic game design keeps to amaze me. Beautifully integrates the push your luck mechanic with the theme as you are 'gasping for air' and struggling to get back to the sub before air runs out. Also, small box is a plus. Really, really recommended. Rating revised upwards by full point.

[i]A nice push-your-luck filler[/i][/size]

This is a game about deep sea diving where you try to get as much treasure as you can.  Push your luck comes in because there is a limited oxygen supply that is shared between all of the players.

There's only so much you can say about push-you-luck fillers, but it hits all of my criteria:
:star: [b]Portable[/b] - It comes in a nice pocket-sized box, which is where fillers belong.
:star: [b]Pretty[/b] - The components are fairly simple, but it's nicely visually appealing when its all set up.
:star: [b]Meaningful Choices[/b] - It's no [thing=96848][/thing], but the decisions were tough enough that I had to pause for a couple seconds to think about it.  That's basically all you can ask for in a game like this.

Deep Sea Adventure is an evil press your luck game. Players are crew on a submarine, rushing out onto the sea floor to gather up treasure and then dash back to the submarine. But we all share the same air supply, and really you're hoping that your crewmates die before they get back to the ship.

On your turn you roll two dice (which have values of 1, 2 and 3). And move that many spots out on the treasure row. If you encounter a crew member in front of you, you skip that spot. Which is good, as the better treasures are further out... but is bad as you now have further to go to get back to the ship.

Then you choose whether to pick up treasure or not. If you pick up treasure, then your movement value is decreased by 1 for every treasure you're carrying (which makes it harder to get back to the ship). Additionally, at the start of every turn you decrease the oxygen supply for every treasure you have in front of you.

Which means that at some point someone will start taking treasure and from that point the air supply will start diminishing. And that encourages everyone else to grab a treasure and start heading back to the ship. At which point it becomes a mad dash to make it back before the air supply tanks out. If you were the last person to continue forward, then you're likely a dead person... because when everyone starts heading back before you, you won't have any fellow crewmembers to skip over on the way home.

The game is played over 3 rounds. If you die in one of the first two rounds, then your treasures are added to the end of the treasure row. Multiple treasures stack (up to 3 high) and count as a single treasure. Any treasure you get back to the ship is banked and can't be lost.

The game is quick and evil and very press your luck-ish. But seems fairly random. Sure, there's some decision about how far to go and when to pick up treasure and when to head back, but it's really a lot about being lucky.

If you like light push-your-luck games (like Diamant/Incan Gold), than this is the game for you. Period. Still have to play a game without someone crying out after a successful or failed dice roll. Also, after each of my first two games there was a player who decided to purchase it himself - that's how much they liked it. It's incredible how well this game works with different player counts. And the divermeeples from the last edition are supercute!

Deep sea adventure is a push-your-luck filler akin to Incan Gold or Diamant. However, both these two push your luck games are different and varied enough in style of play that keeping both games in your collection is warranted. DSA involves a more group think approach. If every diver decides to turn tail and surface, you will not survive the trip going further down. Carrying loads of treasure in a single dive also slows you down considerably when resurfacing and is a sure fire way to perish.

The downside of the game is that newbies often overestimate the amount of oxygen available for the dive. It is quickly depleted and for the first round, almost everyone dies. Unlike Incan Gold, my decision to push further into the caves is not at all related to the players but linked to the probabilities of flipping a similar hazard. Whether others pull out and head back to camp does not influence my chances to escape live. In DSA, player actions to carry more gold or to resuface directly impacts my chances of survival In that sense, DSA slightly deeper game.

Overall, it is a filler and nothing more. I prefer this to Incan Gold but there is just something about Incan Gold and exploring deeper into the caverns that is not replicated here.

This game is easy to teach and simple. The rules could have used a little editing but it's not bad enough to ruin the game. 

Now... this has to be one of the most frustrating games. What your opponents do plays such a huge factor in whether you win or lose, score some points or no points (as well as the random component of dice) that this game screams frustration. 

The games keeps you wanting to try it again because you simply don't want to lose like that. It's a press your luck game that is won simply by not pressing your luck more often then not. Now I know others might have a strategy that works for them, it could be a winning strategy, and that's good.

All in all, I like it. I'll probably get frustrated wth it. But despite its simplicity I would rather not use it to introduce someone to gaming.

Great little push your luck game. Feels like the player group behavior will have a significant impact on the game state and the possibility of two games playing out identical feels unlikely. Even if the few decisions look easy it still feels like they are meaningful and that skill is required with a bit of risking.

In Deep Sea Adventure, you go deeper and deeper to get the best treasure. However, you need to breathe, and the reserve is common to all player. This is the good idea that makes the game working great.

Do you want to get the biggest reasure ? Do you want the race to be short by taking the first treasure and start using the air the sooner you can ?

A very good filler game :-)

Push your luck and "Groupthink" boiled down to it's essence. You can only make it back with a big haul if others are going with you... but the farther you all go, the less likely it is that all of you are making it back! Very interesting, very elegant interaction of  simple mechanics and decisions.

I thought this one was fun, but it seems awfully difficult to make it down to the deeper levels for the better treasures without running out of oxygen.  This also seems like it would be a fun replacement for Incan Gold, which is starting to wear a bit thin for me.

This game is intense!! Simple mechanics to follow but nerve racking because of the oxygen.  More often than not you feel like there is enough oxygen so you go deeper down, but then you turn around and some one else turned around sooner and all of the oxygen is running low, and you keep rolling low numbers...IT'S SO STRESSFUL!!!

This is a great push-your-luck game. I really adore what this does to people as they perhaps roll poorly, and get left behind in the leap-frogging, and all of sudden start picking up every crappy ruins tile they can in order to suffocate the others. There are many similarly fun situations that happens in play.

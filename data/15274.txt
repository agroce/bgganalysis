GAME: La Bataille de la Moscowa
RANK: 4689
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rules are a revision of the award winning system developed by Marshal Enterprises and cover the full range of features that were characteristic of the Napoleonic battlefield. The game is therefore designed with serious gamers in mind. - 
Its a real tactical fight of Napoleonic Warfare!!

Check http://www.tactiquesnapoleon.com for "Tactique Napoléon" as a Spanish variant to these rules, by bringing together the best of both!

The rating is just for the game series.

RATING: 7
Played this game with 8 players at our gaming club and found it to be challenging and fun.  Lots of chrome and fiddly rules but once you learn them the game moves quickly enough.

Shrinkwrapped with slight tear in shrinkwrap on front but no damage to box

Label on back of box under shrinkwrap reads, "La Bataille de la Moscowa, Collector's Classics Release 1, Copy 1349 of 1500 from Weekend Warrior"

Another label on top of shrinkwrap on back reads, "Stratelibri s.r.l. 187,500" and is near another label on back on top of shrinkwrap that's in Italian

BIN: 125

I played this once with 3 other friends once a week over several months. We were playing the French.  After the first few weeks I wondered why our two opponents didn't quit because we were winning so badly.  Then we hit the redoubt and fleches and I was almost ready to turn in the towel because I thought there was no way we could win.  In the end we squeaked a victory.  You might say we experienced the battle the way Napoleon must have.  Great game!

Possibly the greatest Monster game of all time.  Elegant system, yet pretty simple. Just big.  Following games went way over the top in detail.  Coupled with the fact I love to play both sides.....it adds up to my having a 'play' copy AND a mint copy.  And multiple copies of games I normally consider a joke; but not here.

This game is in like new condition in the original zip lock bag that it came in.  The counters were never punched.  Copyright 1975, 1977, Game Designers' Workshop.  I bought this at the U.C. Davis bookstore when it was new.

An excellent treatment of a tough, bloody scenario. The first 'monster game' (though bigger monsters followed).

Not quite as involved as SPI's Wellington's Victory or TSS either on the map or in the rules. This is a slugfest, and easier to play.

Costly and uncertain contests for the redoubts. Good fun. Would play again any time.

Only ever had/played the GDW second edition, which was very cluttered & hard to find units once the full game was set up. It was quite a monster, but the gameplay was interesting. Mostly artillery barrages followed by frontal assaults, while the French probed the Russian left.

I bought this for seven bucks at a closing sale for a store at a local mall. Boy, do I miss the days when you could walk into a local store and peruse shelf loads of wargames. The Internet is nice but I sorely miss doing that. Anywhoo.. I have played several scenarios for La Battille and I do like it. I just do not have the space to lay it out any more. I like the different color representations for the different nationalities in the French/Allied force.

Fantastic gaming experience ,especially if you played it with three other guys. Work fine with teams play.
No big rules problem. 
Also I remember one of my best die roll ever: The polish horse artillery firing on Russian jager deployed in tirailleur in front of Utitsa, bang 66, the first cannonball of the game...

You might be surprised to see the "La Bataille" series actually dated back to 1975...yes 1975!  The series is still continuing.  I hope Clash of Arms game can someday get to reprint this game. After all, who isn't interested in Moscow?

The first of the La Bataille series games and one of the most celebrated titles ever. It's miniatures on a map; all the things players want in a grand tactical Napoleonic battle, without all of the tedious painting, and crawling around on the floor with your tape measure. The Battle of Borodino at the level that many miniatures rules were employing at the time: Regiment/Battalion level units, 100m per hex, 20min per turn. Counters are a little ordinary compared to later games in the series, map look good for the day. Engrossing gaming, and possibly the definitive system for this period and scale.

Marshall Enterprise, Or GDW, this is the real thing. Make plenty of time to play like a long weekend and a day. Be prepared with supplies, snacks, real food, water, your favorite beverage. as long as it doesn't impaire your movement time. It's fine though if it does. If you screw up the game goes faster that way. This is probably one of the best hex solitaire games that's not specifically designed for solitaire. I never found one like that worth salt anyway so that does make this the best game for solitaire. LOL!

RANK: 4072

RATING: 9
Fun and fast paced 2D fighting game. 4 fighters each play a little different.  Uses similar mechanics to BattleCON, but has a faster set-up and play time. Compared to BattleCON this game is much more about hand management and hand advantage than strategy and opponent reading.

Different enough from BattleCON that I can see the market for both existing at the same time.  Faster-paced, yet almost as strategic.  You spend less time attacking and more time preparing, but at the same time, some triggers from BattleCON were removed, making it easier to score hits and prevent null beats where attacks miss.

More people should be checking out this game. I have Battlecon but for me this system is just plain BETTER. If you like Battlecon, but want something that plays faster and simpler but still has strategic and tactical bite, CHECK this OUT!

This speaks to the game system overall, not just this expansion.  It's basically battlecon lite, with slim downed rules and a bit more luck driven mechanics.  It's fun and quick, and if you know how to play battlecon, you pretty much already know how to play this.

I do like the self contained nature of the decks for this game, as opposed to having to switch cards in adn out like you do for battlecon.  These decks are just pick up and play.

At first this might seem like an overly complicated card game, but once you get your head around the way it combat works you'll realise it's actually surprisingly straight forward and actually quite elegant. It captures the feel of a classic fighting video game in a more streamlined fashion than some similar ones on the market, and combines it with amazing anime-style artwork.

I didn't expect much from this, being that it is from Level 99 Games and Jasco, two companies that have been very spotty for me in terms of quality. Excuse the pun, but Exceed really exceeded my expectations. I've played a lot of these board/card game conversions of fighting games, but I think Exceed is easily my favorite. It doesn't do anything that new or noteworthy, but it combines a lot of the best aspects of games like Yomi, Battlecon, and Flash Duel into a system that works really well. I'm a little annoyed that you have to track down all the individual sets, and having foil cards mixed in with regular cards promotes unintentional cheating while shuffling, but otherwise I think that this is the best fighting system Level 99 has come out with yet. It really feels like Magic: The Gathering if it was a fighting game. I hope this continues to get support, as well, as this really makes Battlecon obsolete for me. Puzzle Strike is pretty close to the same quality as this, but this game avoids the pitfall of the luck of the draw far more, in my opinion.

OK. Not a bad dueling game. Some unique aspects. 

Near pornographic card art will turn away some.

This game hits all the sweet spots of card gaming. Low barrier to entry, high level of mastery, wide variety of play styles, and flavorful characters. It even mixes turn-based gameplay with simultaneous actions in an elegant fashion. I'm completely hooked and playing this every week now.

This is my new fanaticism. Provides the best fighting game feel of anything in the genre in a package that's easier to pick up than BattleCON and much more exciting than Yomi. I'm excited to see what future characters and IPs join the roster.

See the first box of Season 1. 
This offering is the weakest among the 4 that constitute season 1. Eva (while very pretty) is a very weak character. Kaden becomes interesting with time, but ,ight not be the most exciting. Miska is my favorite here, with Lily next (a good player to give to new players).

The Exceed system is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Fast, hard-hitting, and brutally immediate. In a lot of ways, I like this even more than the BattleCON system. Though I wish some of the art weren't so, um, tasteless.

Note that my rating is for the system as a whole. I've mixed the characters from different sets and so far none of the characters stand out as exceptionally bad or good, so they all get the same rating.

BattleCon is dead, all hail the new BattleCon!

Seriously, I loved the idea of BattleCon but hated the game itself. My biggest issues were the lack of any randomness, massive AP, and the complicated timing structure of each round. Exceed fixes it all and makes even more improvements.

First is the much-needed randomness. Now instead of having a huge hand of cards that has to be analyzed by both you and your opponent (your hand of cards in BattleCon is essentially open-information), in Exceed you just draw cards from your deck and work with what you have. It's much more tactical and much more satisfying. In Exceed each card now has two different uses so hand management and setting up combos is more important.

The timing structure is much, much better and flows so much smoother in Exceed. When it's your turn to attack you just look for any Before effects, any Hit effects, then any After effects. Then your opponent does the same. No more "beats," no more ante tokens, no more needless complications of BattleCon.

The "timer" has also been improved. In BattleCon you had to remember to advance a timer each round, and if time ran out you would then determine a winner. It was almost impossible to ever remember to advance the timer. In Exceed, if a player's deck runs out for a second time they lose. Very simple, and there's nothing to track.

BattleCon also eventually added rules about using a hit gauge for various effects and different ways to perform your special attack. Exceed simplifies all of that: when you land a hit, you put the card into your "gauge" area. You can eventually spend your gauge to perform your special attacks. It's that simple.

It feels like Exceed is what they originally wanted in this system but they just didn't know how to make it work, so we had to suffer through BattleCon until the system could be refined. I'm glad they finally got through the rough draft, because now we have a really good game. Can't wait to try the other Exceed fighters.

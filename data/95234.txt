A mythos twist on the Atlas classic family friendly card game about torturing and murdering your relatives. Because nothing says fun like familicide! In Cthulu Gloom you do your best to play cards that make your opponents family more dead and or insane than yours. Whoever declines least into gibbering insanity and death wins. Well until the great old ones come back. Then everyone loses. The game is as cheerful and upbeat as any mythos theme I can imagine. Definitely kid friendly. I also like the layering semi transparent cards that you play over other cards. It is a simple and as far as I know graphically unique take on cards in gaming.

Gloom with a Cthulhu theme!  WHICH MAKES IT AWESOME!  I love the theme here!  SO COOL!  But the game is essentially the same, and, while decent, it doesn't knock my socks off.  Best when played with others in the correct mindset.  Don't take it too seriously, tell a story, and see how it goes.  Can be a nice, quick, fun play.

RATING: 6.5
Probably they should just have called this Gloom 2.0. It improves on the rules of the original game a little bit, e.g. to allow people to dump their hand, to not have to flip a stack of cards when someone dies, to offer some bonus cards if you want to hold your hand for an action.

Gloom plays well as either a card game or a story game. An experienced player can beat a novice pretty handily, but I suspect that the learning curve to get to that level is fairly short.

I enjoyed my time with this game but won't be buying it. I love the storytelling at the see-through card mechanics but there's a lot of daft things to keep track off and plenty of down time.

More complicated than Gloom.   Still not sure if I like that or not.   First game underway.  We still haven't utilized the storytelling aspect of either Gloom games.   Perhaps that will come with further familiarity with the game and the characters.

RATING: 7
Gloom is awesome but sadly, I found out the game needs quite an in-depth knowledge of the Lovecraftian creation to be meaningful. And ofc creativity, but so does the original Gloom. Anyhow, I personally with some above average knowledge about the Lovecraftian setting (cause I actually love to read the guy) enjoy it almost any time.

Fun re-theme of Gloom, another light filler game that can be played with non-gamers.

Cards are more detailed so they help facilitate the story telling element better than games like Once Upon a Time because it gives players the option to tell more involved elaborate stories or to simply explain what happened as a card is played (less social paralysis)

Dark theme, cute art and adds colour to the gloom family. Cthulhu Gloom was my first gloom game/introduction so I liked the clear cards and how the game is played by stacking cards on top of one another adding a spacial element to play (as certain cards will cover up previous scores either blocking good scores or erasing penalties)

Con: Card backs are different then all other Gloom games so while you could combine them together, the backs wouldn't match which would drive some people crazy.

I didn't know what I was getting with this game. I think my knowledge of the mythos is lacking because this is a storytelling game and if you aren't with people that aren't going to do that then this is not going to be fun. I still enjoy the game, but it is not for everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Like normal Gloom, but with slightly more appealing theme. I understand the fancyness of transparent cards, but the gameplay is still not engaging enough, it just has this one trick. I don't play Gloom often enough to remember good strategies, it always feels very random when I play.

Same gameplay as standard Gloom, but with a focus on HP Lovecraft.

Gloom is a fun, silly game best played with creative people who don't mind making up elaborate stories while playing.  Knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos is a benefit for Cthulhu Gloom, as otherwise a lot of the jokes will be missed.

I am torn between the original Gloom and this one.  I like the characters in this one better since they are more recognizable to anyone who has read H.P. Lovecraft, but the modifier cards do not seem to have that dark humor that went with the original Gloom.

This is a fun game once you start getting into the storytelling part. I can forgive people for not doing this as they learn the game or start the serious thinking on modifiers though. 

It's certainly something that I think might rival Love Letter as a pub game. But then, I do like to be optimistic sometimes...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This really is not much different from Gloom, but adds a nice twist to those familiar with the Lovecraft mythos.  Plenty of inside jokes and bad puns abound for your entertainment!

One marked change are the "story cards" which add a nice bonus to a player that can claim one.  But these are easily stolen - do you decide to use one of your precious actions to take a card, knowing it could be taken back soon?

Nice new art, this game is worthwhile for those that like Lovecraft and don't already have Gloom.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I really enjoy the cthulhu theme, but most of my friends don't know much about the mythos, and some of the family member names are hard to pronounce thus making it a little hard to play and enjoy. I will be at some point getting the original to play some.

Humorous game with amusing alliteration, a bit weak on Lovecraftian theme; fiddly bits.  Transparent cards are an interesting mechanic.  Labels, icons and text will be hard to read for those with less than eagle eyesight.  Flimsy packaging a disappointment in a game with otherwise good production quality.  I prefer Mythos in this niche instead.

I would consider this a gateway tabletop game for people who enjoy the topical Lovecraft, Addams Family or any horror-inflected dark comedy. It certainly has a unique physical aspect and the twist of losing to win suits the quirky flavor. Some folks I've introduced the game to are actually a little put off by the morbid notion of killing characters, especially their own, which makes it a party game for less prudish guests.

Gloom is excellent and the production of this is fantastic. The artwork and thematic cards are wonderful, but to tell good stories, it does benefit from a knowledge of Lovecraftian stories and lore.

I do still look through the artwork, though; it is so pretty... And, in colour! =D

While I prefer using Gloom (standard version) for teaching the game to people, if you love Lovecraft's stories & the Cthulhu mythos, you'd have fun with this once you recognize the theme & characters. I like the design of this Gloom better as it has some good elements of bringing people back & others that make it more fun between the two.

Same comments as regular gloom below. Cthulhu theme helps but still not enough to move me

Game can be cool with the right people who enjoy the thematic element of the game and get into the narrative of their characters. Otherwise the game will fall flat.

Mechanic wise, seems just chaotic and a lot of take that.

I love the Cthulhu mythos and Lovecraftian horror as much as the next guy, but a lot of the cards seem like nonsense to me. It's hard to get into this game when you're unable to adequately describe what happens to each character. You end up numbly playing card after card, without the intrigue that comes out of ordinary Gloom. If you've read a substantial amount of the Lovecraftian fiction out there and can understand all of the terminology and key terms, go ahead and get this. Don't invite anyone over who isn't on that level, though.

Great rethemed version of gloom. I'm not very familiar with all the lovecraft references but the art is great and the game is a blast. The 'story' cards really add a nice element to the game (which was later added to regular gloom in one of the expansions) and the new design of the untimely death cards is much easier to use as opposed to the old idea of flipping your character.

This game absolutely needs players who can get into it. Judged by the mechanics, it's an okay Take-that-cardgame. The semi-transparent cards are cool, but may lead to a rather crowded look.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (December 2012)

I love the Cthulhu mythos, however I don’t like this game nor the main objective (be depressed and suicidal). Lots of mindless “take that”, bash the leader and also lots of uncontrollable luck, almost no interesting decisions as the better play is obvious. The game is way too light for my taste. The clear cards and art are awesome, however that´s not enough for me. The game can be fun if played with the right group. 

I suppose I could play again if requested, but this is not a game I will seek actively.

I can’t stand this game. It has many things I deeply dislike. 1. Lots of uncontrollable luck. 2. Attack the leader mechanic. 3. Awful theme that goes against my personal life principles. 4. Obvious decisions (almost no game).

This is definitively not made for me, the only reason I have it is because a great friend gifted it to me. Will NOT buy anything from the Gloom game system.

I'd like to play this one a bit more, but the original Gloom is just a bit better in my opinion.

I've had Gloom on my wishlist since it came out (2004?) but never bit the bullet. Well, the Cthulthu theme pushed me over the edge and I'm glad I finally got my hands on a copy. The transparency aspect is a neat aspect and addition to what would otherwise be a normal fun take-that style card game.

I can't wait to play it with more players, especially those who will get into the theme. I'll probably pick up Gloom now as well and all the expansions.

I bought this after watching Geek and Sundry's Tabletop episode on the original Gloom game, which seemed like a lot of fun. Being a huge Lovecraft fan, I figured Cthulhu Gloom had to be even better. While that may certainly be the case for a Lovecraft fan, the story telling component is so important that we've come to find that it's really difficult to play this version if you don't have a pretty healthy knowledge of Lovecraft's works. This one does introduce some cool new mechanics like story cards, but if your gaming group isn't big into Lovecraft, I'd definitely reccomend the original Gloom set instead.

A revised and much improved Gloom, not just a re-theme. That said, the theming does go deeper into Lovecraft's back-catalogue than just 'lol, Cthulhu!'. Fewer instances of useless cards, more cards which do dual duty or help your opponents, so much better!

Very interesting game but it doesn't draw me back in. This game has a lot going for it but for some reason I just never feel like playing it. I thing the theme is to disconnected from the gameplay...

Just like Gloom, but with a Lovecraftian flair.  Hampered only by play style, this game is a load of fun.  You can kill your adventurers in the most painful, horrid ways possible.  Watch out for the Wordsmiths in the group, and for the quick to slam down a card, and move along.  Both will screw the rating.

So far a solid game, kill the people, make your opponents lives happy, and win the game.

A neat gimmick obscuring an underwhelming game. You've got 5 family members you want to kill off, all starting with 0 points. Most negative points wins in this game, so you want to play negative points on your cards and positive points on opponent's cards. If you're lucky enough to draw a kill card, you can play it at the start of your turn and kill off one of your family members, hopefully one who has lots of negative points. The game ends when someone's killed off all 5 of their family members, and whoever's scored the most negative points on dead family members wins. But there's so many take that cards, including undeading people, that there's no lock ins. The neat gimmick is that the cards are transparent - the points are placed on three spots on the cards, so if you play a card with points on spot 1 on top of a family member who already has a card on it with points on spot 1, the points of the latter will be covered up and replaced with the points of the former. So it provides a card management decision. There's also lots of icons that get referred to on card text - bonus points and other stuff usually. Lots of card text effects, which is generally ok. But really, it's just another Munchkin or any number of stupid take-that card games with little control, where you play for the experience and expect to be stymied and hit. The gimmick doesn't save it and the experience isn't interesting enough for replay.

This is not my style of game. I knew that going in, but nonetheless indulged a friend that wanted to play. There is very little strategy and a lot of take-that card play. The humor was okay, though I expect it would wear thin after a few plays. I do like the transparent cards and I think someone could make a good game using them, but for me, this wasn't it. The owner suggested that the game could be a good storytelling exercise, and I guess that's true, but why not just play a storytelling game or RPG that could do this better?

Ive always avoided the Gloom games, thinking they were in the same category as games like Munchkin and Killer Bunnies.

Interested in seeing what the expansion adds.

Gloom is one of the unique type games that everyone looks for. You want something new and exciting, and they definitely took a new approach to card game design. The gameplay is certainly different in theory from other games, but I found myself getting lost in all of the card descriptions and back story. I blame part of this to the timing and environment to which I played this in, but ultimately the stars would really have to align for me to play this again. Just not my cup of tea.

Cthulhu Gloom takes the game play of Atlas' Gloom and puts a Lovecraftian spin on it. Each player controls a group of protagonists, and your goal is to make them as miserable and insane as possible – preferably with them dying quickly while your opponents' heroes remain sane and (at a minimum) alive. In the publisher's description: "While your characters Gibber With Ghouls and Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you'll encourage your opponents to be Analyzed by Alienists and to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points. When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins."

A simple re-skin of Gloom, the Lovecraftian inspiration makes it slightly more palatable to play but only just so. Gloom isn't really that bad a game. I just find its pacing to be far too slow and I think part of the problem lies with the game's design (graphic and otherwise). There are too many circumstantial and interdependant cards and mechanics for what should be a light, silly card game and the resulting experience does indeed end up sapping your enthusiasm, just as the game's name might suggest.

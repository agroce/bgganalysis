A great market mechanic where you compete with other players to optimize your end game score through manipulating the sequence of selling commodities, their collection, and distribution. The theme and art are good as well and the components are top notch. I really enjoy this game.

Kickstarter deluxe - nice coins, components and artwork.  Simple mechanism, but engaging strategy.  Can be very competitive or not, depending on your game group.  Mechanics do a good job of balancing out first player.  Really like the market mechanics. (Most market games seem to move the market too slowly for my taste - but the adjustment per mining board here seems to work well.)

Stock market/economic games are some of my favorite games ever, but this missed some main things I like about such games. Primarily, I like the buy low/sell high aspect of stock games, and the risk/reward of when to hold and when to sell. Nautilus Industries doesn't really have much of this going on, as you just acquire gems, and when to sell them is usually pretty obvious (or some times even required if you don't have somewhere to store the gems).

In addition to making money from selling gems, you can buy shares of stock, which increase in value the more of the matching type of gem is sold. While this mechanism worked, it just didn't feel super exciting, and it seemed that stock values tended to be fairly even when everything washed out.

Also, not related to the rules, there are some mind bogglingly bad graphic design/component choices:

1) The subs. What the heck? The colors on them are really tough to distinguish in some cases, and they blend into the board making it tough to see who is where. These should have been the showpiece of the game given the theme, but they seem like an afterthought.
2) The cost of the stock certificates, which is really important but nearly impossible to read unless you hold it right up to your face.
3) The cubes that track stock certificate values don't physically fit on the track.

Overall, everything is still solid game play wise, but perhaps I'm prone to being more critical as stock games are my favorite genre, and the problems with some of the production choices were irritating as well. I'd still play if others wanted to play, but would rather play other games in the genre.

This game a has great balance of gem value vs Share value (end game multiplier). There are many tough, but fun decisions to make. A little bit of "gotcha" gameplay, but nothing an opponent does to you feels so painful that you feel bad. Loved it. Played it 6 times already and will keep playing it. And Deluxe version has AMAZING components

RATING: N/A
Backed the Kickstarter at the $5.00 level to get access to the PnP. Artwork looks fantastic, and I will almost certainly be putting together a copy within the next month or so.

Will still be watching the Kickstarter closely and will almost certainly back if they hit the $25,000 mark as the stretch goal upgraded components look really great, particularly the coins, custom dice and customized meeples.

--
Upgraded pledge to include the Deluxe copy of the game on Backerkit. Still not 100% sure I'll keep the upgrade, have until December to decide, however it's a type of game I don't presently have in my collection and almost everything about Nautilus Industries appeals to me.

--
Ended up pulling out of getting a physical copy. I will probably regret missing the deluxe version at some point in the future, however at this time I just can't justify the cost for a game I don't know if I would ever get to play. I will work on getting a decent PnP copy done up at some point in 2015 and see how that goes over at board game night.

Can't fault the production quality (though I did have the premium edition, so YMMV obviously), but the game itself ended up being bone dry. A lot of obvious stock-market-esque mechanics were missing for no obvious reason. Couldn't honestly recommend. We'd play Gnomes of Zavandor or Power Grid any time we'd want to play this (and both are better games).

Decent economic, stock game.  But tracking commodity and stock prices on the board is kind of awkward and the spaces on the board for tracking the stock prices are too small for the chunky cubes provided which seems like a bad design decision.  Would play again though this isn't really my type of game.

Just found this game on kickstarter. Only hours to go.

While the game should be right up my alley. I won't get it.
Reason is while reading the description of the game, possible actions and having a look at the prototype picture of the game. This looks like a 20 euro game, maybe 25.

the stretch goals with the metal coins is tempting though. 100 metal coins that adds a lot of value to it. I added coins to my fief pledge 51 coins for X dollars. the fief coins look brilliant. I don't know about these. The mockups certainly don't convince me. If I did I might have pledged for it.

So basicly I didn't pledge because I value the game to be around 20-25 euro. And while the extra's really add some value to it, much more than the difference between the basic and deluxe edition. 
I hope I am proven wrong.

Might still make a last minute PNP pledge. depends on a friend who has a decent printer

A quirky, light stock market game with a somewhat ridiculous theme. The core of the game hinges on balancing the current market value of the goods with their associated share value for endgame scoring. This gets trickier later in the game when higher valued shares drop automatically without market activity. There are also some nice opportunities to mess with your opponents and build temporary alliances.

I do wish the investment component was a bit richer (as it is now, shares are only bought, never sold), but the way it's implemented is certainly appropriate for the game's weight.

Unique blend of worker placement and economic manipulation. I do use gems for the stock market instead of the over sized cubes. It's a little hard to read the stock market values, as well, I suppose. Also note that I have the deluxe version with metal coins. This is a great medium weight market manipulation game, though. I highly recommend this indie "gem."

RATING: 6.8
Simple market game.  Sell high, hold out for the best price possible, but sell before your opponents flood the market and drop the price, which could make your stockpile worthless. (Or flood the market making their goods worthless).  Try to get a monopoly if you can.

If you hate player interaction (weird, but ok) or you hate having to watch what other players are doing (really weird, but ok), then you will NOT enjoy this game one bit.

There is a simple stock market that players can invest in.  But there is no trading or divesting of stock - it's more like a bonus that gives you extra points if a particular good sells enough during the game.

Rules are simple with nothing fiddly to remember. Easy to teach.  Kids 8 and up should be able to handle the rules fine though they may struggle with a bit of the strategy, when it is good or not good to buy stocks and may need help with the math.  Non-gamers should also have no real problem and this is probably a good gateway game.

Continually adding and tracking the goods and their values is a bit fiddly and not sure how well this scales with the number of players - probably the more the better, but I've only tried with three.

One last issue is the summary on player cards and back of rulebook which both omit a critical step - you must raise the price of each good that doesn't sell as each mining tile is resolved - that means, over the course of a round, a good could raise several times in price - if you fail to do that prices will never rebound properly and the game would get very stagnant.

My rating might go up - there is really nothing wrong with the game, its just a lot lighter than what I typically want to play.

Nautilus Industries is a stock game in which players operate a submarine company that collects and sells various colored gems.  The sale of each gem decreases the market price but increases the stock price associated with that gem.  Players must decide whether they want to spend their three actions collecting gems to sell, buying stock, or doing various other things like manipulate gems or increase their warehouse size.  The game ends when one of the stocks maxes out in price.  While there's not really anything wrong with the game, I found it to be a bit too dry and calculable for my tastes.  I kept feeling like I could do the math to figure out which actions were better if I really spent some time thinking about it, but ultimately didn't want to be bothered.

Deceptively simple rules mask a brain burning math game with lots of player interaction. Fantastic game, want to play more. It's telling that the majority of the negative comments about game play (rather than components, see below) as of this writing are that the game is "too brutal." That's a positive in my book.

All this is marred by absolutely awful components in the non-deluxe version which simply must be replaced to make the game playable. The small cardboard player markers are virtually invisible against the cluttered background of the mining zones. The cubes to track the current value of each gem type are twice as big as the spaces in which they are to be placed. The colors of the gems, certificates, and cubes don't match. No markers are provided for upgraded mining robots, meaning gems must be sorted out from the draw bag, and are prone to being jostled and mixed up with the gems to be mined. The quick reference card is missing a crucial step (adjusting stock prices after each mining board, rather than after each complete round). The font and decoration choices on the stock certificates make them difficult to read during play, and impossible to fan out to display all the information when stacked. Note that most of the pictures in the gallery as of this writing are the deluxe components, which replace the cardboard player markers with meeples, though it's not clear to me how you would mark an upgraded meeple with a gem, since they can't be stacked.... Fortunately, all of this can be fixed with some minor component additions.

Nautilus technology opens up an interactive, worker placement, deep sea mining exploration. Randomly seed the sea floor ore fields. Ores have different rarity. Interactive sub placement. Business actions includes a changing harvest order and swap resources that will catch unsuspecting players off guard or force them to swap back.  Upgrade storage to time the market AND take rare ore out of production.  Sell harvested minerals and ore in the price adjusting commodity market. This phase is done sequentially for each ore field which greatly amplifies the feel of supply-demand forces on the market adds a another layer to placement and business decisions. Bravo. Ore supply increases processor company size and its stock value. Vertically integrate by using mining profits to buy stock in the processing industry. Very thoughtful commodity/stock sim.

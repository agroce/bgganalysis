Nice filler game or game to play with your growing kids. It's not all that deep, but there's something to think about and it's quick and works well.  The cards are fun and you've got to love the Dragon and the mechanic that goes with it...mess up your neighbour!

RATING: 5
Gobble food, but not as much as the King.  Uncertainty added by a dragon who steals from the King's plate.  A light as air set collector.  As someone else commented, all the mathematics at the end is out of character with the rest of the game.

I had played this a long time ago and found myself thoroughly unimpressed.  Later gave it another shot on BSW and grew to like it.  After more in-person plays, I'm left wondering what it was I ever disliked.  I think it's a very decent light filler with rapid-fire choices and resolution.  Really like the cardstock too.

Quite enterteining filler.  The aim is to collect different kind of food, but always less (or equal) than the king is receiving of that kind, otherwise, they are not valuable.  Interesting collection mechanics for a portable card game that plays in 15 minutes.  Fun to play.

The play is almost as fun as Coloretto, but the ending math mutes the fun a bit.  I prefer more easily scored games in this category, like 6 Nimmt! and Coloretto, as this speeds up play so you can go for more rounds in one setting.

RATING: 7
Clever, light game.  I like the way you have to decide between increasing your count or letting something go by in the hopes it makes it to the king's table.  Card counters have an advantage, especially in how to use the Emerald cards.  Still, an enjoyable game - especially with families.

I played this one with a local game group. Once we discovered the value of keeping the pets on the table for use late in the game, the scores were much closer and counting cards became more important. It made for a nice filler game that would probably scale well. Since I think my family would enjoy it, I would like to trade for a copy.

Components: These cards are typical of Abacus Spiele: great, linen-finished quality, with (somewhat) attractive art, but with some horrid Abacus Spiele logo scarring their back sides.

Experience: This is a game of negative value, in the sense that collecting an item devalues it, similar to the route-planning in Paris Paris. To increase the value of one type of food, I must avoid collecting it. I find this mechanism difficult to strategize around, and disappointingly implemented in this particular title. Probably the first Moon game I haven't taken to.

kort kaartspel waarbij punten gescoord worden door verschillende types voedsel te verzamelen. Het aantal van elk type wordt vermenigvuldigd met het aantal van datzelfde type dat tijdens het spel aan de feestdis van de koning belandt, met dien verstande dat men niet meer kaarten van een bepaald type in de hand mag hebben op het einde van het spel dan er bij de koning liggen.

I like the tie in with the emerald game but I'm not certain the kids really understand how the scoring works. My youngest son refuses to pick the fruits as he doesn't like them for example. :)

I think this game will actually play better with adults.

Update: After some more plays the game gets better. There's more to it than you think at first.

RATING: 5
Players are setting the table, trying to match their meal to the King's.  Basically a card drafting, set building game where you're trying to accumulate as many of a set as possible without going bust (i.e. taking more of a set than the King has).  Fast, luck based and very fluffy card game.  Harmless enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick and easy, but non-trivial.  Love the theme and artwork, and especially the way the box art is integrated into the game play: stand it up on end to show the king and his portion!  Could potentially be played open-handed for added strategy, but I haven't tried it that way yet.

Set collection game by Alan Moon where you are choosing cards from a display or the top of the deck.  Sound familiar?   Trying to keep the right pace with the King's cards is what makes the game interesting, and the dragon is what makes the game fun, as it most certainly screws other players.   Can be played by kids or grandparents.

Another fun game for kids in the 9-12 age range, as well as adults. It is a card taking game with a dummy player, the King.  The goal is to eat more than the other players, but less than the king so he doesn't behead you!

RATING: 2
Played 2 times. Felt a bit like the decision making in Coloretto and the "auto-set" building in Mamma Mia, but it just didn't click for me. I find there to be more control in Coloretto, which should make King's Breakfast a better family game. But somehow, it just doesn't grab me. It seems difficult to manipulate the foods in such a way as to ensure you score well. Light breezy filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For something so simple, we ended up having a lot of fun.  Of course having the memory of an elephant would ruin this game as keeping track with what the other players are holding is key.  Fortunately, I do not have such a memory so it worked out fine.  Nice light filler.

[Filler rating: 7/10] Nice little filler. Not a lot of interesting decisions, but just enough speed and small complications for a quick five-minute game for three to five players. King Lui isn't really a mainline filler; it's more of an opener, a closer or a travel game with a reasonably small footprint. Works very well with newbies, nongamers, casual gamers and even older kids.

Decent but extremely lightweight filler.  Dominated by the luck of the draw with little room for skillful play apart from memorization.  In theory I don't like it, but I always have a good time playing.  It holds its place in my collection because it's a good choice to play with those with extreme gameophobia.  If you enjoy something like Mamma Mia, there's a good chance you might like this.

A good degree of chance in this one detracts from good planning. The dragons are good in a sense, but in another way, they just mess your plans up even more.

Played one solo game, 3-player, and nearly fell asleep going through all the cards.

This cycles on too long for what it is, at least with smaller numbers of players.  It does some potential screwage with the dragon, but for the most part it seemed a little dry.

I'd definitely think of this as a game to play with a younger child, because the strategies are not that complex, and the play is fairly simple.  Timing is a key- when to use a dragon and on what.

Collecting cards of different colors; the score at end of game is the amount you have of that color multiplied by how many are collected by the King (the cards no one selected go to the King). If you have more of a type than the king though, that type of card scores 0 for you.

Cute and quick card game.

Rating based on playing with children.  It's a fun, light family game that moves quickly.  It seems like it has the potential to get a little aggressive through the use of Emerald, the dragon, which is fun.  I like the theme of the game and setting up the box (a la Beest) is a must.

A light, quite quick, filler card game. It has some difficult decisions and enjoys simple to understand rules. The scoring is quite complex and might need a pen and paper for some.

This is an interesting balance game.  You basially can take whatever food you want, but you have to make sure that you never take more food thatn what the King has.  If that happens you can lose all the points from that kind of food.  This is where the strategy comes in.  People are constantly trying to manipulate the cards to screw their neighbor.  Good simple card game that you can take with you anywhere.

I have not played with many players yet, we only played at 2 with more cards so far. It's a quick filler game that seems interesting. 

The only draw back I can see so far is that most of the time, scores are tied.

Also, there is no good reason for not diversifying. So like somebody else said on BGG, you pickup at least 3 cards of each suit and end up not busting,  scoring all the cards, and good chances to win.

So there might be little strategy in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick playing filler which is about acquiring as many cards of each type without going over the quantity that the king ends up for breakfast.  Five dragons can be drawn which can eat two items from the king's breakfast to cause much anquish to others.

Best with kids and/or casual gamers.

The play is reminiscent of Coloretto for set collection with limits. My kids prefer King's Breakfast for theme and chart-less scoring. I like how the points and limits increase for unpicked items while they decrease just a little from "take that!" plays (dragon cards).

The three-handed game might benefit from fewer cards.

Played 20-25 times. This is really light. After 9 games, there doesn´t seem to be many meaningful decisions. Even when I win it doesn´t feel very satisfying. I have tried different strategies but the best strategy is to just make short-term decisions. Don´t use dragons too early. Don´t pick up a 4- or 5- card-course early, because everyone will notice. I will be happy to play this to wind down after a meaty game, but not more than one session, please. I have yet to try it with children or with 5 players.

You try to take slightly less food than the king. Points are calculated by # of your cards of a type of food X # cards the king has; sum different foods = your score. However, if you have more cards than the king, you are disgraced and get no points for that food.

*每人的一個動作後剩下的卡片給國王
*牌不夠擺滿桌面就結束，這些牌棄掉

It looks like a kids' game, and certainly kids can play, but there is some depth here.  Players collect cards representing different foods.  The "king" gets whatever cards are not chosen each round.  At the end of the game, players discard any sets containing more cards than the number the king has.  Remaining sets are scored by multiplying the number of cards the player has times the number of cards the king has.

Purchased at Essential Games in West Pittston, PA on 10_4_06, impulse buy. Like Alan Moon games, but oddly only noticed he was the designer after purchase. Saw the Rio Grande label though. 10-5 First game with wife and son, played twice. Excellent little family game! Described by one of my GeekBud's as an "opener" as opposed to a "lighter" game, I could see this as a Sunday night family game that will hit the table a lot. Cute artwork takes nothing from the game, rules clear and simple. 

2014: a year or two ago, I brought this to my inlaws, and got some kids to play this, Coloretto, Flowerfall with me. I asked them when we were done which they had liked best. They ALL chose Coloretto! And they liked KB the LEAST. Well there you go. Dropping to a "4".

Interesting card game in which players draft cards, the remainder increasing the values of the cards held, so there's alittle tension with contradicting needs.

Very easy and entertaining game. The strategy aspect is in knowing when to let the king have certain foods, and when to play the dragon. sometimes you can dragon your own food to push others over the limit. Beer and Pretzel level. I really like it.

RATING: 6.5
15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Cute game about eating with the king. In the game you try to eat as much as you can, of several dishes, while not eating as much. 

Each round, a number of cards equal to the number of players X 2 is flipped onto a central offer. Cards of the same food type are stacked together and are eaten in 1 go. Food that is not eaten goes to the king for food. 

You score food types, if you have equal or less of that food type than the king, and each food is worth the number of points equal to the amount the king has eaten. (so if you have 4 puddings, and the king has eaten 5, your puddings are worth 20).

There is a draogn in the game, that eats two food cards from the king, and introduces some more player interaction. I actually enjoyed my game of this, it's so light if floats, but I felt it was enjoyable, light filler.

Great fluffy filler.  Easy to learn, easy to teach.  Has a fun theme that makes sense. I suspect people are playing it wrong and not setting up the box as the King. Seeing the king in front of you really makes a difference knowing that he has graced you with his presence as you eat a meal together.  

I like the tie-in to Emerald (the board game). 

It seems best with three.

RATING: 7.5
Nice little filler here.  The gameplay is simple.  There is some luck involved, especially toward the end, as a nice set could end up in a player early in turn order.  However, it has some nice balancing strategy as you try to remove stuff from the king but not so much that you fail to score at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Nice filler, well-implemented on BSW. It plays pretty quickly but there are some fun little decisions all along: take a big pile of cards, or give it to the king and hope you can collect more later? The addition of the dragon is especially nice: allows you to mess with people a little!

--- Summary ---
Each round, place several cards face up in front of the king (on his table), sorted by type (cake, turkey, etc.). Each player takes one group, or draws a single card from the deck. Any remaining cards go to the king. Occasionally dragon card(s) may be available: if you choose this, discard any 2 cards from the king's table. Play through the deck, then score VP for each type of card that you don't have more of than the king. Each card is worth as many VP as the number of that type of card with the king. Most VP wins.

RATING: 6
A good idea for a game that translates into a quick playing card game that's fun and easy to learn.  Easy enough that children can play with adults and casuals can play with serious gamers.  Fun to break out every once in a while.

[RGG 2003 edition] {Filler, Food; card drafting, set collection; optimal 4-5p} King's Breakfast is a nice family card game: cheap, cute illustration, thematic, fast-paced, fairly tactical and interactive. It's short (around 15 minutes per game). It's easy to teach and learn; children have no difficulty in understanding it. There is nothing special but it is a fun and satisfying filler.  Light confrontation with the * limited * Emerald cards, with which players can hurt the score of other players.

Good card counting skill is advantageous. Sometimes, choices are limited because some actions are obviously bad; e.g. taking 5 cards of a food isn't good.

[House-rule] A more aggressive variant can be used - each excessive card of the too many portion deduct 1 or 2 points.

King's Breakfast should not be used as a main dish but is best served in the light weight filler department. 

This card game is fast and fun with a nice balance between luck and calculated decisions.  The experience is quite unique,  yet it is as streamlined as a design can get.

Each player collects food from a pool of cards,  with all remaining unpicked foods moving to the king's collection.  Upon completion of the deck, the players compare their hands to the king's tableau - scoring in each category - unless they have amassed more of a particular type.  In that scenario they score nothing,  So,  the idea is to get as many as you can in a type, without going over.

With it's straight forward approach,  King's Breakfast is a strong candidate to rule in the accessibility department.  I suggest you don't pass up the chance to dine with royalty.  Just remember.....that gluttony comes attached with a very high cost.

I have played this once.  It was fun, but I did not get a strong impression of the game, at least not enough to rate.  By the end of the game, I could see how the game works; how gambling could pay off and how I could influence the King's portion, but by the time I saw all that, the game was over.

I just played again, and it is a nice enough, fluffy game but there just doesn't seem to be enough turn angst to really capture me.

First introduced to the game by Rob & Ramone.  It was the 4th game we all (John was there too) had played that night, and the 4th time that I came out as the winner.  Whereas earlier games had seemed a bit dull (esp. Kings in the Corner) I really liked this one, so I planned to ask for it for Christmas, but it was out of print, and I couldn't find any place selling it still.  So when I saw it on clearance at an online store one day (with only 1 copy left!) I knew that this was not just the only time I'd ever find such a good deal on the game, but perhaps the only time I'd ever find the game for sale period. And thus I bought my own copy..

One of those games I discovered through playing on BSW. King's Breakfast is a cute and fun filler, with a nice dose of tension (so often missing from lighter games). I'm unsure how many non-obvious decisions there are, but the game is quite enjoyable nonetheless. I can't see it not being a hit with casual players, so highly recommended just on that basis.

This is an odd Rummy variant that leaves something to be desired.  It's a little too light for me, with your choices being fairly obvious each turn.  I've bought this game three times, and sold it each and every time.  It's oddly appealing, but not so that it ever makes the cut when I have to decide to keep it or ditch it.

Moonish in speed of play, simplicity, and fun. I am worried, however, that play of the "Emerald" (Dragon) cards is actually so counter-productive that seasoned players will not play them resulting in an end-game situation where players wreck the king's portions. Hopefully repeated play will prove me wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple quick game that's good for adults or a mixed-age group, even with youngish kids. I tend to avoid the dragons since they typically hit only one player instead of cards that let you earn points relative to everyone, but they can turn a game sometimes. Play fast and avoid counting cards unless you want to spoil the game for everyone else.

Nice, light, semi-abstract lunchtime filler. Fills a similar niche to Hive.

RATING: 7
An abstract with a well integrated theme, if such a thing is possible.  Building up a critter so that it can move faster and/or fight better also makes it more vulnerable as it needs to be surrounded by more empty spaces.  That's the very clever core of this game.  Strategic options seem abundant.  My one concern is that the first player advantage is quite strong.

Can't say I'm a fan of the mouse mat board, though the adaptoids themselves are nicely done.  It was much too tight a fit squeezing everything into the pencil case the game came in, so that has been dispensed with.

RATING: 8
Really good abstract with theme.  Your bugs may move, attack or develop themselves in order to kill a certain number of the other side.  But the stronger you are, the more freedom you need...
Really clever game, to play slowly, with a nice presentation.

RATING: 10
One of the most interesting and original game designs that I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Masterpiece! Now if I can only master the strategy!

Please note that my comments are for the "Super Adaptoid" edition which is beautiful and very functional. The high cost is justified.

Not bad at all, but Adaptoid is a very hard game to play from time to time. I prefer more forgiving and less tight abstract games.

RATING: 6.5
Relatively low rating is after one slightly unsatisfactory play, but I expect it to raise with more.  The rules seem (and are) quite simple and elegant, yet we had some confusion regarding a few of the details (which were only clarified afterward, by checking threads here).

The pieces are on the small side, yet an adaptoid with appendages is too large to be contained by the circular spaces.  Add to this the necessity (since they're fragile little things) of sliding your pieces around, rather than picking them up, and the game becomes somewhat fussy, with pieces being pushed around, errant appendages falling, and needless repositioning.  With all due respect to Nestorgames, this game really should have chunkier pieces (which [i]are[/i] available, but for an exceptionally high price).

Still, it's an interesting game, and shows signs of greatness, so it's worth putting up with a bit of bother.

A cool abstract with, paradoxically, a well fitting theme.  There are many trade-offs to balance, do I go with fighting power or mobility,  a few strong units or many weaker ones.  Adaptoids with more legs and pincers can move further and fight better, but are more vulnerable to starvation.  

There are two ways of capturing, a chess-like move-on-top-of capture and a go-like take-away-liberties capture (eat vs. starve in terms of the theme.)  This makes for some interesting tactical possibilities.  So far I'm enjoying it very much.

RATING: 7
A brilliant abstract that actually makes a perfect sense thematically. Simple rules, engaging games, coupled with an ingenious rule to make the strongest pieces the most vulnerable. I am enjoying this game immensely.

Played this when I first got it, and didn't comment until years later...

It's a good lightly themed abstract.

Reminds me of Dvonn or Tzaar (games I like), in how 'strong' pieces become fragile, but here there is a theme too.

Implement with IceHouse:

Rules card needed,
Each player: 2 stashes (Lights & darks) etc.

1: Raygun (for capture)
2: Base
3: Boosters (for movement)
Mining: must have space to mine (eat)
Upgrade (or your oppentn getws piece)

2x can trade one of your pieces for your base captured by opponent.  (Gives effective 12 bases)

Use hex on Martian Chess back, or Poker Chips for bd.

序盤の定石が決まっていてそこからズレると即負けというのがちょっとしんどかった。駒を強化するのもロマンがあるというより勝つための必要最低限だけ強化するという感じ。

The deluxe edition is expensive, but it is worth it!

Adaptoid is a very nice and refreshing abstract. Each turn, your game pieces may grow in strength or speed, but at the same time they become more vulnerable to death by starvation.

Strong pieces are most powerful when the board is empty, but as soon as new pieces spawn or the battle reaches a table border, strong pieces become suddenly weak, as smaller and faster adaptoids are able to kill them by surrounding and starving them. 

So while you combat, you have to balance properly the evolution of your pieces and avoid stacking all evolutions on the same dude.

In theory there's a lot of ways to equip and position your pieces, but in practice your moves are mostly constrained by your opponent's - and in particular the second player is responding to the moves of the first, as there seems to be a significant first-player advantage. It also seems the game would often be settled after the first mistake, since a player who is ahead can just go for exchanges.

Well I respect Nestor as a publisher making lots of abstracts available through his company.
This was a really tough evolution game where it easy to make a mistake.
As a design it really works.
Pretty good

Bought at Essen '09. Good looking 2-player abstract, comes with a foldable and washable board. Easy to take along.

Very nifty mechanism: the "better" your pieces get, the easier they are too kill. Very thematic game for an abstract by the way.

NL: 2 persoonsspel waarbij je elkaars "adaptoids" (een soort aanpasbare microbes) probeert op te vreten.

There is a wonderful balance here between the power of the pieces and their vulnerability.  Thematically, it works very well also.  

Rating may go up with further play.  My one reservation at present is whether the first player has a significant tempo advantage.

I'm not usually a fan of abstract games but this is the exception. A brilliant little abstract with theme! Plays quick so multiple plays in one sitting is possible, allowing you to try out multiple strategies without feeling bad about losing. One of the many gems in the often overlooked nestorgames range.

A lot better than I initially thought from reading the rule. It is very clever that stronger piece can be killed easily by having not enough free neighbor spaces.

Quick, addictive and just as compact as anything on the GIPF series, Adaptoid has two players putting their own pieces onto the board and then developing them in order to eliminate rival pieces either taking them or occupying a certain quantity of spaces around them. Players must "grow" or develop pieces in every turn and the more powerful pieces are, the easier they can be attacked, so that the first movements in a game (especially by the first player) can lead it to very different routes: one powerful piece sweeping the board, many slow pieces building and/or eroding barriers, suicide attacks...

The whole catalogue of Nestorgames is full of refreshing, portable ideas making any fan of abstract games dribble in anticipation; Adaptoid might be its very highlight.

I like this game. It has some neat mechanics that fit in directly to the theme - as if an abstract can have a theme! - that also creates some interesting decisions.

Awesome! A really cool 2-player abstract strategy game! Yet again, a great Nestor game with super components and storage! This game is like no other, it's tricky and fun creating little clever Adaptoid creatures that move and attack! Having to feed the little guys is the tricky part! You might create a wonderful little Adaptoid or more, but if you don't leave enough surrounding spaces free...the poor thing will starve...making your opponent gain points! While my wife is not fond of abstract strategy, she enjoys this game quite a bit!

Abstract where you build adaptoids, giving them legs (movement), pincers (capturing opponent pieces), and free space (feeding, required to stay alive).

RATING: 6
I wanted to like it more than I did: the physical implementation is too cumbersome (trying to add new legs and claws to an adaptoid; trying to move an adaptoid without its legs or claws falling out). This distracted us from the gameplay itself.

RATING: 7
A good game, players seek to move and grow their adaptoids around the board to capture the opposing side, of course, you capture through starvation as well so the more powerful the creature, the more easily it starves to death.

A little too paralysed by thinky moves, but still an interesting different little abstract that goes strongly against intuition of what you should do. Probably area control under the hood. 

With a few more plays, there are multiple different strategies and ways of playing simply to react to the other player. Suddenly the 'obvious' bad moves can be useful after all.

Original mechanics, quite interesting indeed. Fantastic material gives you the feeling of something moving and pinching. Unfortunately , it seemd to me quite a brain-burner in the negative aspect of the word. It seems, from a 2 plays experience, that after you win the first "skirmish", it's much much easier to win the entire game. it seems rather difficult to catch up .... i'll play it again for sure

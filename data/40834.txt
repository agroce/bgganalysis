Rating based on 2 plays.
Seems like a great follow-up to Dominion for those who have exhausted the potential of the original Dominion cards.
For people like me who have only played the original game a couple of times I'd see little point owning both of them.

Edit:  I now own both of them!  But I have played the base game quite a lot now....

Without a doubt one of the best games I own, including the sister game and all add-ons. This game has a simple basic rule-set but the cards provide variety. While other games have variety from game to game, Dominion almost seems like a different game every time you play. Critical thinking skills are both demanded and exercised by this game. The wording on the cards is clear and precise and requires players to have similar thinking to play. I generally use this game as a litmus test to see if others can think precisely, cleverly and deviously (as opposed to thinking fuzzy and using language lazily).

Excellent expansion for Dominion, adds variety and works also as a stand-alone game.

[Despite being playable on its own, I think it really should be listed as an expansion for ranking purposes rather than a game. Having Dominion twice in the TOP-10 is just stupid.]

Rating of 7 includes the various expansions that I've played as well.


By far, my favorite card game.  The number of card combinations makes each play slightly different from the last.  The winner tends to be the one that can adapt best to what's currently available.  A nice blend of solitaire and interactivity.

After countless games, this one has dropped a little.  It's now in the realm of "fun to play" but never do I look forward to playing.  Still enjoyable though.

The cards added in Intrigue put a twist on my favorite deckbuilder.  I like the multitype cards and how some cards utilize that well such as "Tribute" which makes the player to the left of the user discard the top 2 cards from his/her deck and rewards the user depending on how many different types of cards are discarded; an action card gives +2 actions, a treasure card +2$, and a victory card +2 cards.  The victory point cards with other uses also make the game more interesting.  This expansion adds quite a bit of fun variety and makes several new engines possible.

RATING: 9
This expansion is more like "Dominion: Round Two."  The new cards are *extremely* nice.  Possibly overpowering in a few respects, but they shore up some of the weaknesses in the base game.  I like how they mix up the gameplay and change things.  The combo cards (VP + something else) are very nice, while the new attack cards are just mean!  Best effect likely obtained by mixing this with the first/base game.

Still not deep or strategic enough for me to rate a 10.  Can be pretty random and unforgiving.

Some of the cards in this expansion flat out improve on cards in the base set with the most notable one being the Ironworks vs. the Workshop.  Why would I bother with the Workshop ever again?  The expansion totally outmodes some base cards and that doesn't strike me as a good thing nor as a good game model.

An excellent game that is well worth playing.  I like this one better than the base game.  Improves on it in almost every respect.  People new to this "series" should probably start with the base game as it is simpler and, more likely, easier to follow.  For those of us experienced with the base game, this expansion simply rocks!

Slightly more complex than the original Dominion. The biggest difference is the presence of more cards with double function (Victory/Action, Victory/Tresor, etc) and the presence, in general, of more text in the cards. I was initially skeptical and preferred Dominion cards, but once I got used to the Intrigue cards, I think that they offer more variety.

RATING: 3
Pretty generic like the core set but with worse cards. Essentially just a less interesting Prosperity. The only real notable non-vanilla things are Duke with Dutchies, especially if you have the Dutchess card in your collection.

Overall, it's further plagued by my major point against Dominion: EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME EXACT STRATEGIES. Meaning if you find a good Harem strategy which gets countered and you counter that then everyone counters the counter and it fucking never ends. The only safe thing is to again, ignore the Kingdom stock and just buy money. Except it's worse in this expansion for two reasons:

1. There are even MORE self-countering strategies
2. All the cards are walls of text and more complicated which means it takes a lot more work for actually less impact.

Just avoid this piece of shit.

This adds a lot more variety to the card sets in Dominion, but if you pick cards at random from both sets, it also sets up situations where you may have no +Card cards or no +Money cards.  This can lead to some longer games, but forces players to develop strategies with limited options.  Also, you can combine both sets to have up to 6 player games, which is pretty fun in my opinion, but definitely creates a longer game.  I think it is a must have for fans of Dominion.

I do really like Intrigue, but it's got a bit of wonkiness in that a lot of the cards stack pretty abusively due to the whole "make a decision to lose this or that" removing artificial limits like on Militia.

In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

Well, it's Dominion, but with slightly more complex decisions from the cards (e.g. pick 2 of the following options...).  Not quite as streamlined as the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simply superb!  Over 60 plays...

Adds so much dimension to the original.  Probably not quite as easily accessible for new players, but for those familiar with Dominion already, this is just the ticket.

So many more options available and decisions to make.  The game really feels a lot more interactive.

The fact that you can mix and match with the base set offers even wider possibilities and many, many more enjoyable games.

Dominion itself has been an enormous hit with all my friends, and Intrigue is proving it's worth even more so.

If you like Dominion, I would heartily recommend Intrigue, as it adds so much extra flavour and extensibility to the original game.  

A definite 11 out of 10 for me.

It played completely differently to the original game, with a more random kingdom effect.

Juego de construcción de mazos (deck building), muy entretenido, donde se debe lograr el mejor mazo. Gana el que tiene más puntos de victoria al final, pero estos puntos de victoria (en cartas) sólo estorban durante la partida en tu mazo,ya que no sirven para nada más (con excepciones), bastante entretenido y muy rápido.

Esta versión "Intriga" trae cartas diferentes al Dominion original, generando estrategias más agresivas, de puteo a los demás con cartas que afectan su juego, desarticulan su mazo y lo traban.

Si no te gustan los juegos de sólo cartas, evidentemente no te agradará.

This game is for people who love card games with medium strategy involved.

Intrigue adds a lot of attack cards. I'm not a huge fan of attacking other players; it's better to just have a more efficient deck than it is to ruin other players' decks. Saboteur can go right to hell as well. But, the half-victory cards are super sweet and an excellent addition to the game. Intrigue and prosperity go well together in my opinion.

Kellemes meglepetés! Az alapjátékra néhány játszma után ráuntunk, nagyon lapos volt. Ebben az újabb változatban megjelenik néhány olyan lap, ami kicsit több taktikai lehetőséget nyújt, gondolok itt pl. a Herceg kártyára, ami a pontozást teszi színesebbé.
Egyébként maga a játék egy nagy lenyúlás, a lapoknak kb. a fele ugyanaz, mint ami az alapjátékban volt, jobb helyeken ezt kiegként adnák ki. Többek közt ezért nem is vettem meg. A BGG-n eleinte nem is került fel önálló játékként, aztán pár héten át hol önálló játékként szerepelt, hol kiegként. Ennyi erővel bármelyik power grid pályához adhatnának játékpénzt és bábúkat, és mind szerepelhetne önálló játékként.
De a lenyúlás ellenére is az alapjátéknál jobb mindenképp!
---
Elég sok kártyán lehet akár 3-4 dolog közül is választani, ez tetszik. Ami még érdekes, hogy bizonyos kártyakombináció esetén akár olyan stratégiát is lehet játszani, ami egyáltalán nem igényel kincsvásárlást (legalábbis nem a klasszikus réz-ezüst-aranyat). Egyértelműen változatosabb az alapjátéknál!

The first expansion for Dominion can be played as a game by itself. The new cards allow a more sophisticated play experience, and give more depth.

My favourite Dominion part so far. It was incredible to play this after playing over 70 games of the base game - it really brought up the idea to a whole new level. I love the fact that there are much more choices in the game. You not only choose what to buy but you also have several options to play an action card. I love the victory/action or victory/treasure cards. I love the fact that the rule from the base game (who first buys gold wins) is much more rare with the expansion. I love cards like Courtyard which allow you to decide if you want your current turn to be as good as possible or do you want to make your chances bigger to have a great next turn.

Initial Impression: This is a great gateway game, being very easy to teach and learn. The number of cards in the set make for a lot of variability. The Intrigue set allows for some direct interaction and nastiness. This is a perfect game to showcase the deckbuilding mechanism.

10 Plays: Coming back to this game after a long hiatus, the game feels cozy, comforting, and familiar, like an old, favorite sweater. With only 10 games under our belt we haven't even begun to explore all the different combinations of cards. We've experimented with a few strategies but found that the cards on the table will dictate the winning strategy for that session. I can see this game staying in our collection for a while.

Dominion Intrigue is based on the theme of OPTIONS and CHOICES. Being that this game is already about options and choices of which cards to buy, then layering in which cards with which options to buy, and then having to exercise only one of those options at a time is a bit too much for me right now. I can see why people may rate it higher than the base game, but I appreciate the original in its state and I may edit this rating later, but it's too many options for me now.

Dominion was the first game I purchased after discovering BGG.com and Dicetower.com  Between Tom Vasel's reviews and praise of the game, its high ranking on the BGG charts, and my search for a game that I could play well for 2 players (my wife being the 2nd player), this game looked like a home run.  It turns out it was a Grand Slam.  My wife really likes card games (like Bridge, Cribbage, etc.) so this wasn't such a far stretch in that there would still be cards in your hand.  I like customizable card games so it seemed like a fitting game.  In the summer of 2011 we played this game every day during our then 18 mo. old daughter's nap.  I got so addicted that I went and grabbed Dominion (the original game) and Prosperity.  Though the novelty has worn off and my rating of the game has fallen from a 9.5 to an 8 (edited 2.8.12) it still stands as a wonderful game to introduce to people who like gaming and non-gamers alike.  The game mechanics are easy to master and it plays quickly once everyone has a feel for the 10 Kingdom cards that are in play.

A great expansion to an amazing game.  It adds a little more interaction and color and expands the amount of players to 2-6, however the game does slow in pace a little with 5 or 6 people.

I played the first 2 games of it by its own. I did not include Dominion base game.

There was obviously some effort put in to address some of the shortfallings of the previous editions.  The addition of multiple win conditions (Duke/Duchies) as well as the utility victory cards is nice. The addition of cards that allow multiple different actions is good too as it allows for more choice for card play.

However, the improvements are not major enough and it still feels like most of your important decisions are made in the first minute as you decide on how to construct your deck.When playing your cards there is almost always no tough decision.

I can't say much one way or another about my first game of dominion.  I do have to say, "what's not to like about it?"  There's a few cards that I think are too powerful, but, not bad overall.

If you'll pardon the pun, I think this is an intriguing expansion to Dominion.

Intrigue is a very good expansion, it adds heaps of variety to the base game, without adversly affecting it in any noticable way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
this is a fine expansion to dominion, although it can be stand alone. but i would not recommend it as the limited variety of action cards results in less synergy between cards. this basically means that a pure money strat (rin) can often dominate. this is infuriating (rin). so in conclusion, please combine with other sets for optimal experience. small children(rin) will enjoy the fanciful artwork on the cards. some of the cards are pretty fugly tho, looking at you shantytown. also harem. also explaining to a small child what a harem is could get awkward so consider that before buying.

Some of the cards in this expansion give you a choice between different options. This is a nice addition and it adds some flexibility to your strategies shich is a good thing. Some of the other cards, while not being really overpowered, add a lot of take that feel to the game. I'm not sure the game needed that. I prefer the Seaside expansion.

What makes Dominion one of my favorite games is the variety, and this expansion adds tons of that.  It also adds some fresh money/victory cards which is a treat as well.  And, thanks to this expansion, I finally got hooked.  I found myself dying to play another game of Dominion as soon as I finished the last one.  I actually have passed up on playing games that I really enjoy, or even the opportunity to play new games, just so I could play more Dominion.  Call it addiction if you want, but I am having so much fun with this particular addiction.

Some of the fun in this expansion is in the cards that give added value to some of the less important cards.  Suddenly a Coppersmith makes Coppers something desireable, or a Duke makes Duchies almost as useful as a Province.  And the added interaction is a treat as well.  If I were to level a complaint against this expansion it would be that the choice cards can sometimes slow down players who have analysis-paralysis.  Still the added variety is delightful, and I will always have these cards in the mix when I'm randomly selecting kingdom cards for a game.

RATING: 5
This is (supposedly) the "player interaction" set.  I find it only moderately succeeds at this.  Most of the interaction cards are underpowered (Minion, Masquerade, Scout, Secret Chamber ...) and thus just get passed up all the time.  Most other cards are just average in power, a few highlights (Saboteur, Torturer - all attack cards, hmm) , but Intrigue cards are more likely to fade in the background if there is a power card on the table.  Also, Coppersmith?  Really?

It does have enough variety to make it worthwhile if you play a lot of Dominion (I do).  However, you should purchase Seaside first, and then move on to this if you still get a lot of play.

This expansion's goal was to increase the interaction between players.  It's a great idea, and the expansion pulls it off fairly well.  Some of the cards make it a lot more fun, but I roll my eyes sometimes when others come out (Swindler).  Obviously, it depends on the players, but this expansion has lengthened our average game time.

RATING: 4
Multiplayer solitaire. The attack cards are symmetrical, so you play them regardless of your opponent's state. The only other form of interaction is the cards running out, but that barely matters in my experience. Still fun though, the strategy is interesting and the play diverse.

Even though I’m not a Dominion fan, I already conceded it’s an enjoyable game: sadly though in my experience none of its expansions is remotely as good as the basic game. In fact they add an excessive and unnecessary layer of difficulty and, mainly due to the frantic pace they’re being released, feel kinda rushed: actually, as a casual Dominion player, I think the basic game plays fine enough; sadly though a hardcore Dominion player never has enough of it and wants ever more, even better if the newly-published cards are filled with convoluted and obscure abilities only an expert player such as himself can master.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great expansion to Dominion for more advanced players.  The cards do more and therefore can have deeper strategies attached to them.  However this does add a new level of difficulty to the game, though it doesn't raise the bar too high.

RATING: 9
Full disclosure: I was a playtester. So very good, both by itself (as it contains some familiar card archetypes twisted from their original incarnations) and mixed with the base set (as there are plenty of completely different cards as well.) Lots more decisions, not only on what to buy, but how to play cards during your turn. Cool instances when you need to decide how to play the odds in a specific situation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Better than the original base set, as the cards feel more subtle somehow. Many of the cards have a number of uses, upping their utility. There are no cards as universally useful as a laboratory or smithy, but cards like Baron or Steward are amongst the most powerful when played correctly. I strongly recommend that if you can buy only one Dominion set, buy Intrigue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
More good cards for an excellent game.  I don't think we will every play just Intrigue, but mix the two games together as that is how I look at this game is as one big expansion.  The cards we used were quite good and fit in well.  A worthy buy and expansion.  

I will continue to mark all my plays under the original, Dominion.

RATING: 5
Jó játéknak tartom, de mégsem kedvelem annyira. Alapvetően az a bajom vele, hogy az akciók láncolásával át lehet forgatni az egész paklit, bármekkora is van. Pedig pont az lenne a számomra a lényeg számomra, hogy minél több kártya, annál ritkábban tudjuk használni és így megkeresni a megfelelő arányt a játékban. Már sokszor játszottam és nem mondom, hogy nem játszanék később. Nem véletlen, hogy sokan szeretik. Egyszer szeretném ki próbálni azt, hogy egy típusú akciókártyák egy körben csak egyszer vagy kétszer lehessen használni. Kicsit unalmassá vált az, hogy egy-egy játékos egy halom kártyát tett le, és még a 8-10 darabig tudtad követni, de onnantól már az azonos lapok érdektelenné tették a másik játékát.

Some of the cards in this set are very nice.  I like the cards that have victory points in addition to coins or actions.  I still feel like the game strongly encourages the trashing of the weak "start" cards (copper & estates)... there are at least 2 new cards that permit card trashing.

I'm glad that official rules for 5-6 players are provided.  I have only played one game with 6 (experienced) players so far, and it had the same feel as 4 player games.

9.5 --> 10. I realized that I'm always willing to play Dominion, and that will probably never change. This rating is for Dominion and ALL of its expansions together. Each game is a puzzle to solve, and the luck of the draw makes the journey to realize your plan that much more interesting. I prefer this as a 2-player game, but I can't see myself turning down a multiplayer game either. There is so much variety in Dominion and each game is quick. This is a wonderful game.

A very interesting expansion to this already classic deck building card game. I enjoy the more choices that are available is using all the cards, and the more interaction and scheming you can do with you opponents while still keeping with the same spirit of the base game.

Terrific expansion.  I tend to think of Intrigue as the second half of the base game.

The inclusion of modal card effects and playable victory cards while a bit more complex than needed for Dominion's introduction are basic concepts that add a lot to the Dominion play experience.


The inclusion of rules for five and six players is a nice touch, but unfortunately do not provide as satisfactory a play experience as the base two to four player game.

Fixes my main problem with the original - actual game play is more interesting. With the original biggest decisions were at the start, what deck would you build? Now you have decisions to make all the time, how best to play the cards you have.

Wouldn't call this an expansion, as I'd only play it standalone.

La mecánica del juego es la misma que en el Dominion tradicional, solo que incluye nuevas cartas que permiten nuevos combos. A parte de eso, no se aporta nada al juego.

Es más de lo mismo. A mí si me gusta, por los mismos motivos que me gusta el dominion. Eso sí, no alcanzo a entender porque éste está mejor valorado que el dominion tradicional.

Had an opportunity to get introduced to the final playset in prototype form a GCOM: Games Days. Many decision making points have been moved from the selection of what card to buy to the play of action cards, making a very nice addition to the first set.

Intrigue builds on the base game by adding combo cards that can be used as two different card types (e.g. victory point/action cards, action/treasure cards, etc.), as well as a slew of new action and victory cards.
This expansion blends seamlessly into the rest of the game and adds even more interactions and possible strategies to the Dominion game.

Un juego que ha gustado mucho entre mi grupo de jugadores habituales.

RATING: 5
Interesting new cards and adds new ways to play Dominion but I've run out of fuel with Dominion and thus am not so interested about the Intrigue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the new options, but they do tend to turn a very fast game into something that moves noticeably slower, which is not good for the Dominion engine.  I don't mind playing with a few of the new cards, but would probably limit them to 3 or so, the rest being base Dominion.  Someone in my play group owns this, so I don't see any need to own it myself.

I think companies should just release what really works (see Pillars expansion, Ticket to ride Europe, Kingsburg, Race for the Galaxy - Gathering Storm, etc). This follows that pattern , taking Dominion to a new high.
Great cards, better strategy and interaction. Some of the artwork is a little off (why is the Scout a hunchback with dysmorphic features?) but overall it's candy. For your brain.

This one is rather interesting. A lot more attacking type cards then the other sets which adds a lot of strategy and depth but makes my wife not enjoy it as much. Still it's a great game, I definitely recommend this one over the original starter box.

RATING: 9.8
Although I love this game I only give it a 9.5 because the original seemed much more coherent, you felt like each deck had 100 strategies.

Intrigue does not disappoint, don't get me wrong. It's a wonderful game even when standing alone but I always felt I'd like one or two of the cards from the original.

So from me a full 10 as an expansion but only about a 9 or 9.5 if it stands alone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The interactive "screw you" cards (e.g., Trickster, Saboteur, Torturer) add something to the game, but not enough. While I'm glad that I own this expansion, I don't see it as necessary (whereas that *is* how I would categorize both Seaside and Prosperity).

It's not my favorite Dominion expansion, but it's a good one.It adds a lot more attacks to the game, which is interesting, but not popular.

The additional decision making in this version of the game is great.  The value of cards changes more than before, and there is more risk vs. reward analysis to make in each game.  The split cards 'action/victory' really add a new dimension to the game, and the new attacks are even better.

I keep wondering what the heck is going on with my Dominion games, too many of them seem to have problems. And I wonder if it's actually Intrigue that's too blame ... for it works really well stand-alone, but I wonder if its more complicated powers are not combining well with the other complicated powers in Seaside and Alchemy? I dunno. Still, I rate Intrigue an 8 for its good stand-alone experience.
---
Early days, but so far I'm pretty impressed with the new Dominion set - it really does have a different feel from the classic, and it almost feels like it plays better. A little worried by the complexities of some of the cards, since Dominion is  a game that really needs to be played fast. But the new card combinations (action/VP, money/VP) are particularly welcome and can change up the pace and so the desirable deck mixes. New combinations are obviously welcome. I'm not exactly sure how far this particular train goes and how much it can really be milked - I doubt very much more, and too many expansions could very easily strangle the game - but so far so good.

I am rather irritated that RGG did not take the opportunity to upgrade the thoroughly mediocre physical design on this game. Text is still to small, iconography is poor, and it's idiotic that the treasures and VPs all have identical designs (sure, keep the highlight and text box colors to indicate category, but make the coin and background colors distinct). The contrast between Race for the Galaxy and Dominion is stark.

A more enjoyable set than the base game, this provides the optimal starting point in my opinion.  The action cards offer some strong combos and alternatives to the big money strategy dominant in the base game.

An essential expansion, in my opinion. Intrigue really shows you how varied Dominion can be.

LOTS of attack cards in this one. There's a few that are pretty annoying if you don't have Reaction cards in, but nothing super broken. If normal Dominion is too interaction-light for you, this may not change your mind as Dominion's form of interaction is still pretty passive, but it's definitely worth a play to see if the attack cards help.

See my comments on the base set. This feels less like an experiment in how the system works and more an attempt at making interesting cards to fit that system. My ideal setups are typically 3 cards from Intrigue which interact in different ways or lead down different paths, and then some simple utility cards from the base game to support those strategies.

[u]January 10:[/u] Bought the expansion in november as I was getting tired of the original after 30 plays and Laurène kept requesting it. The expansion did revive my interest for a moment. Also, the cards in the expansion are a lot funnier (that's my opinion) and offer more things, specially with the mixed cards (kingdom/action, gold/kingdom). Also, some multiple choices cards add a lot of decisions to take which is a good thing.
I prefer the expansion to the base game.

RATING: 8
A good stand-alone Dominion variant. The cards are much trickier than those in the base game because there are many cards where you need to decide between different actions, and I like that aspect. I especially like the combined VP and money/action cards. 

I think Torturer and Bridge are pretty neat cards too, but I still need to play with a lot of the other Kingdom cards in order to give a better evaluation of this expansion. Overall I think I like the base game just a bit more, but this is still a pretty good game.

A great improvement over the original - which didn't even need improved.

This expansion adds an entirely different dimension to the game, as many of the cards force you to actually make decisions (such as the Pawn, Nobles, or Minion).  As such, it also increases the player interaction a bit more with the attacks cards.

By the way, I think Tribute is broken by not being listed as an "Attack" card since it mills your draw deck for 2 cards - not fair, and I should have the option to be able to respond with a Secret Chamber/Moat.  If the Bureaucrat is an "Attack" then so should Tribute.

[b]Includes Dominion Intrigue upgrade pack[/b]

This is our third Dominion purchase, after the base game and Prosperity. And, though it's early, it appears to add enough variety and unique feel to justify yet more Dominion plays. This game seems to introduce options. And, for an experienced Dominion player, options are fun and good. Not sure how this would work with newbies, but for myself and my wife, it has a lot of promise.

We played the base game 50+ times, and Prosperity almost 40 times (though most plays combine sets), so I'm not terribly worried about whether or not we'll get our money's worth out of this purchase.

If you are going to start making the investment in the  Dominion line, I strongly recommend a minimum of the first two.  While Intrigue can be played standalone, there is a synergy between these two.  After this expansion, things start to get a little more weird and complicated with new mechanics that are still enjoyable, but alter the game from its roots.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a standalone, this is a perfectly cromulent alternative to the base Dominion game -- though I would advise newcomers to start with base Dominion. As an expansion, it's OK (and a nice gentle step up complexity-wise from base), but not in the first rank of Dominion expansions. Its rep as the nasty and attack-focused expansion has a germ of truth but is grossly exaggerated on BGG. The really interesting aspect of Intrigue is the cards that offer a choice of multiple uses.

RATING: 8
I haven't played this much as the original so time will tell if my initial reaction stays the same.  Also, I have only played this combined with Dominion (5 decks from each game).  There are some cards/decks that are brilliant in Intrigue; others I would be tempted never to use...like the Saboteur. But overall a positive gaming experience.  Without a straight up defense card Intrigue does seem a bit more "take that" oriented.  But it is far far from being a disaster.  I like it...but I prefer pure Dominion at this point.  But I would still consider purchasing this since cards like the Harem and Duke are such a great addition/idea.

Also, I played one five player game (which can only be done with both games combined).  The only difference is the pace of the game.  It is slightly slower waiting for your turn...especially if the Black Market is in play.  Otherwise it seamlessly created the same gaming experience...just taking longer.

Update: Made the purchase.  There are too many good cards not to own the set.

Slightly more complex than the original Dominion, Intrigue adds significantly more interactions to the game and spruces up formerly lackluster strategies.  I'm not sure that it's better than Dominion as a stand-alone game, but it's worth owning both Dominion and Intrigue.  Really worth it.  It's still the cheapest, quickest, and most elegant CCG experience without actually playing a CCG.

A significant bonus is the ability to play with more than four players if you own both Dominion and Intrigue.  I've played with 3-6 players, and it's great in all cases - though the tempo changes slightly, it's still far from a slow game!

Need to play more to get used to the cards.  First couple of games was like a light kick to the groin.

I love Dominion because the card combinations are always different and it leaves a lot of room for player choice in terms of strategy. That said, I find that there are a few cards in Intrigue that limit my choices. Minion, for example, is a must play in just about any game. Shanty Town is another card that just always seems to work. Other cards, like Wishing Well, just don't have the same impact on the game. I like Intrigue a lot, but I feel like it is losing some of the enjoyment by itself. It needs the other sets to stay relevant.

RATING: 7
Dominion overall is better than I expected. Intrigue is a decent follow-on expansion. I'm glad the cards are increasing in complexity.  If my son didn't like this game so much, I probably wouldn't play it much....but I rather like it (to my surprise.)

RATING: 9
Loads of interesting cards here, too.
And - to do the name "Intrigue" justice - some pretty mean attack cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I haven't played a lot of D:I, but I have played enough Dominion to know what I think of the basic concept here, and it's solid enough, but attack cards are generally my least favorite thing in Dominion (slow the game down and make it more confrontational than I like when there are more than 1 in the mix) and this set has a number of them.

On the positive end of things, there seem to be a higher density of cards that have decision points involved, on the downside, many of these cards are attack cards and the Dominion universe still does not have cards that adequately punish the playing of attack cards; I'm waiting for something that allows you to search the offending player's hand and force them to trash something of your choice, or something that doesn't allow them to buy anything for the round or the like.

Some of the attack cards in this are onerous to deal with because they change the composition of your deck, particularly Swindler. There are now additional ways to sift junk out of your deck as well, but I still find it annoying.

On the balance, there is a decent mix of new stuff here. On the main I prefer the original card mix to this (and greatly prefer the original + Prosperity when I'm in the mood for a slightly longer game). If you're getting this as an expansion only it's certainly a nice thing to have as you will be able to more effectively tailor the game to your liking. Just don't make the godawful mistake of playing the game with too many attack cards, it will slow the thing down to a crawl.

The 4 here reflects the fact that I find this slightly worse than the base game by itself. It's not terrible, and I would be willing to play it, but I would lobby for other options.

Dominion plays extremely fast and is very easy to explain to new players as there are very few rules to explain beyond the action printed on the cards. Where it can fall down is in the lack of player interaction (deck dependent) and necessity for a well organised storage system.

The deck-building mechanic is fun and gives a decent re-playability. I like it better then Dominion because I felt dominion was about building a deck that would allow you to go through 15-20 cards every turn. This is a little slower, and some fun attack cards. Not to mention I love the Minion (I want to replace the picture with one from Despicable Me!)

I was skeptical, but it's not bad at all. Only played a few times so far, but enough to play with all the cards. I do like that some of the cards have effects that feel "bigger". I don't like that some of the cards require more "effort" to execute. Or maybe that's just my bias having played 99% of my Dominion games on bsw, where execution is very fast. Disappointed that bsw only got 5 cards from this expansion. Can't blame them, though. The Dominion implementation was so good that I had no desire to play the physical version. And having been so spoiled, I can't really bring myself to pick up Intrigue either, although certainly would play someone else's once in a while.

What is it about this stand-alone/expansion that sees me losing more than I win?  My son and I tried an experiment: we played the following games in one session:

- straight Dominion (I won)
- straight Intrigue (he won)
- random where there were more Dominion (I won)
- random where there were more Intrigue (he won)
- exactly 1/2 and 1/2 (I won)

What did this prove?  I excel at Dominion and he excels at Intrigue/I suck at Intrigue.  I will change this!!  LOL  Still, I like this game.  Perhaps the fact that my brain has not quite grasped it is fodder for my enjoyment of it.  I love a challenge!

A lot of new cards here, and that provides variety to those bored with the base game (as I was for quite awhile).  The big plus to me here is that several cards add to the interaction level, making it less of multi-player solitaire.  This game needed that badly, in my opinion.  Few of these interactive cards are devastating - they just are annoying and can thwart someone's short-term plans.

Although I can see the marketing value of making this game playable on its own, I think it lacks balance and is improved by having some base game cards that are simpler.

So far my preference on expansions goes to Seaside, which offers more interesting choices.  Still, this is a nice solid expansion.

I'm a big fan of the "Minion" card. There is a nice blend of cards though a couple are so so. "Saboteur" seems a bit over powered. I found we tend to have less fun when someone uses it and we tend to avoid it most times.  I think the game is a solid 8 as an expansion but get's a nice boost for being playable by itself and adding an extra potential player (max 4 to max 5). Bought this after my friend got Dominion it was nice to have two separately playable games that can be combined.

Intrigue adds a lot of player interaction into the base game. If you primarily play at two players, Intrigue may not be the strongest expansion. It adds a lot more into the mix played with three or four players, with cards that seem weak in two player blossoming into valuable cards with more players. (more meaning three or four, never play Dominion with more!)

I can respect that Dominion was the first deckbuilder, but it is as interesting as watching paint dry when compared to newer deckbuilders.

I don't know that you'll go wrong getting this over the base set if you're picking one or the other. This one adds options to your choices. You get to choose one of three options and things like that. I prefer the base set over this, but it's still fun. I've taught people Dominion via this set and with the base set, and the base set is always the way to go. Choices are nice, but if you're new to Dominion or deck building, the choices get to be overwhelming.

Some of the art is confusing if you care about that. Some of it looks really sharp, but then some cards look more cartoonish. Not sure why the difference.

Overall, it's worth having in your Dominion collection as an additional set. If you're just starting out and you haven't played the game, I would recommend the base set first.

Intrigue is a very viable alternative to the standard base game of Dominion. There are some nice cards in Intrigue. They both increase the playtime a bit and add more decisions for players. This is both a good and a bad thing. If you like Dominion you probably have it already. If you have Dominion and want more replayability, get Intrigue. If you have Dominion and play it only occasionally, you might not need this expansion.

Expansion for Dominion.  Adds in another hex card and some defensive cards.  Deck seems somewhat more watered down compared to original set as in many of the cards from the original deck seem much more powerful.  This deck kind of "fills in the edges" and gives interesting effects as opposed to provided many "core" cards.  Also gives you enough cards to play with 6 players instead of 4.  Same downsides as with Dominion in that it is ruled by card counting.

To me, Dominion was an acquired taste. Starting to like the game more and more.

Therefore, although I do like the Intrigue expansion, I consider trading away this one.

Adding this to the base game improved on an already interesting mechanic, mainly by adding more interaction. See my comments on Dominion.

With both a core set and Intrigue a good game party could have 2 games of Dominion going on. Intrigue is obviously more cards for the Dominion game, but I really like the new card set. It has some new mechanics that I really liked, such as the combo cards which were both victory points and an action or gold. I also really like the cards with choices, such as the new Pawn card. All in all this expansion is a great and is more than simply "more cards".

Definitely not as good as the original.  Cards are too powerful and not balanced as well.  we'll need to integrate it into the original game at some point but am afraid to offset what is already a great game in Dominion (original).

Got this soon after our purchase of the base game of Dominion.  There are a lot of really 'mean' cards in this set that my wife doesn't like us to play with, but she really enjoys the dual kingdom cards and I enjoy the kingdom cards with options.

RATING: 8
This expansion is special because it is the only expansion that can be bought without the base game.  It also can act as a 5-6 player expansion in a way (the rules explain how to set up the 5-6 player games).  I personally don't enjoy games as much with more than 4 players, but it's nice to have if needed.  The cards themselves are a very good addition, some nasty ones in the set that can cause some hostility :) but that's not a bad thing.

Intrigue adds some amazing cards, I especially love the cards that are both victory points and actions.  There are some excellent degenerate combos you can do in this game which I appreciate.  Dominion with Intrigue is probably my favorite game to play, although I really find Dominion best with two players.

Has some interesting cards, but I cannot stand the artwork on a majority of the cards.  What the hell happened?  The first Dominion set had maybe 1 or 2 cards with what I would consider sub-standard artwork.  Not only is Intrigue's art terrible, it's inconsistant.  Why do 2 of the cards look like Simpsons artwork?  That is just insulting to me. Did they have an art contest at a local high school to get the artwork for this expansion?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some interesting and brutal new cards here.  I have only played with the expansion alone but I suspect that especially when combined with the original game, a few of these cards will seem drastically cheap.  We've found even so far that there are a few highly favored cards and several that get ignored.  That said, we will enjoy adding variety to the game.

Great expansion, adds a lot of variety to the turns. In the base game, a turn is simple... just throw all your cards on the table (well... sorta). Now you have to choose during you action phase, which increases the level of tactics.

Overall Dominion comments, not necessarily this expansion. I enjoy Dominion. It is a fun deck builder. Sometimes we leave out attack cards so it creates less of an adversarial approach. Can play back to back to back games and not get bored. Better with cards which are less wordy.

The cards produce more interaction --- much of it nasty --- than those in the regular game, and it's not as easy to figure out how they should be resolved. Once you get the hang of the cards, though, you'll probably want to be sure a few are in the mix, in particular the hybrid cards.

Good expansion with some nice choices within the cards and some nice interaction.

Not as good as the Prosperity expansion, but good.

All in all, Dominion: Intrigue is a nice addition to the Dominion-family. Somehow it doesn't really grab me like the base-game, but I haven't played it even remotely as often as vanilla Dominion. Since most of my games are with my girlfriend and she doesn't really enjoy the game when it is played too cut-throat, I guess I haven't even started to explore the full potential of the new cards yet.

* There seems to be more interaction due to the cards of this expansion. But since a good deal of the cards from this expansion can potentially mess up the cards of the other players, the game loses a bit of it's friendliness. This is something I don't mind. But similar to my girlfriend, there are people who don't like this quality in a game. So I guess, you have to be a little careful not to scare people away by adding this expansion.

* The new double-function cards are a great addition. I do especially like the Noble-card.

I liked this at first but then it went stale. No real player interaction. If you buy cards to combo you either draw them together or you don't. If you buy more generic cards you just play them and buy more of the same.

I'm not a big fan of any of the Dominion expansions, but I'm such a Dominion whore that I'd rather play the expansions than most other games.

---edit---
I dropped the rating from a 7 to a 6.5.  A game of Intrigue takes 2 or 3 times as long to play as Dominion.  It's fun to have new cards, but I only enjoy playing this set if we remove the cards that take a long time to play.  For instance, some cards have 3 or 4 options on them.  Couple these together with things like a bunch of Minions and 1 turn can sometimes take 3 or 4 minutes.  

---edit---
Dropped from a 6.5 to a 5.  I'm really not a fan of Intrigue.

Follow up game to the excellent Dominion.  Players start with a 10 card deck of crappy copper and estates, and must sculpt a game winning deck stuffed full of victory points.  You get a bit wary of expansions to blockbusters, but this one is great.  Basically a self contained game that can integrate with the base game.  Played three games of the new one and like the branching decision tree that the new cards offer (the OR option).  Still plays like lightning once you know what the cards do.  The Bridge seems amazingly good, but not a game breaker.  Zero theme, but good game play.  Again, crappy cards with too small text, but I guess we're committed to this look now.

This has some of my favourite Dominion cards, but also has some really lame ones as well (wishing well is useless!).  It would have been a lot better as a small, more affordable expansion with more consistent card quality.  I rate this slightly less than the base game both because of the inconsistency of the card quality, but also because I appreciate the elegance and simplicity of the base game card set. I would still recommend this expansion to Dominion players though because there are some really great cards.

Card Drafting; Deck Building; Hand Management

Card game based on building and balancing your deck to give you a high probability of drawing good card. Practice makes perfect. I will play this game again, but I think it needs expansion, which will give the game a greater variable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The new cards really introduce a lot to the game, in particular the victory/action/coin cards. A money strategy isn't as dominant as it was in the base set. I have decided to rated Intrigue lower then the base game due to a conversation I had with my cousin; As a lot of intrigue cards have a +1 action, it removes some of the decision making that comes with the base game. For example, if you have a thief and a smithy in your hand, which to you play? Isn't as much of a deal in intrigue.

Adds some slightly more complex cards to the mix.  A pricey expansion, when you think about it.

RATING: 7.75
(Up from 7.5 base game)
Intrigue improves on the basic dominion formula in a number of ways.  First, there are cards which have 2 or more types, an obvious but still welcome introduction.  Then there are cards which have multiple functions, and the player decides which to use each time it's played.  Lastly, there are just more complex types of effects and interactions.  This makes it a more tactical and competitive version of the game.  As the first of the expansions, it started to show us what could be done with the design space carved out, yet unexplored, by the original.  

This is as good a spot as any to put a word on player counts.  The base game plays well with 2, 3, or 4.  The expansion includes enough starting deck cards and extra victory cards to play with 5.  DON'T.  
There aren't any more of each kingdom card in the supply, so your strategy is heavily restricted by what the other players are doing.  And more players just means longer to get back to you and more waiting for people to shuffle.  If you have 6, I suggest you do what our group does and set up two 3-person tables with different card sets, play separately, then switch.  If you have 5, play something else.

Played this as a stand-alone for a couple of rounds to try out the new cards. This expansion contains just a little too much bizarro to really be fun on its own. Both my wife and I have found that this version really works much better when used in conjunction with the original game. That way, the bizarro is diluted into tolerable levels by the normal base game. When used in conjunction with the base game, this expansion really begins to shine. It keeps the games fresh and exciting with the new and interesting dynamics without overwhelming the gamer with too many strange mechanics. Good expansion to a great game, but the base game is a must own, imo.

Intrigue brings more to Dominion. Double colored cards, more Victory cards, new brutal Attack cards (e.g. Saboteur which everybody hates) and a whole basic set which makes it a standalone game. It can be further combined with the core set for a game for 6 people.
It's one of those must have expansions which is more than that.
Still brings no theme though. For me that was never an issue.

Did a game day of Dominion with one of my best friends. Did 8 games in one day.

It help me see some of the cards in this expansion.

Dominion is very enjoyable like always. Looking into getting this expansion.

Got the expansion in a game trade.

Update:

Played again in a long time. Still had fun playing the game. Thought that I was pretty much done with this game. Playing it again makes me want to get another expansion.

*Update 2*

Got a deal with a friend. I got every expansion of Dominion. So, I now got the basic set a 3 expansions twice. Going to trade what I have as double.

Or maybe bring Dominion to my brother's place and play with them to see if they enjoy it. Might give basic game as a gift.

Really should be classified as an expansion rather than a standalone board game, but.. semantics. This is a great collection of additional cards for the base game - probably the best in my opinion. They aren't too complicated and integrate well.

First expansion I got from Dominion and the general feel of this one is more satisfying. More interaction, more fun cards, the double cards are also awesome. If you only have the money for one Dominion, I'd say get this one (since it is the only expansion that also works as a base game).

We played the core Dominion for ages! But it was borrowed. Whilst we liked the Seaside expansion, there were three real choices:
1. Core
2. Intrigue 
3. Core bundle and an expansion (more money)
After reading all the reviews and chatting to friends we settled for Intrigue. I like the fact they make Estates and Duchys more a part of the game!

I don't like the cards as much as the base game, but they add a whole new dimension to the game.  Some feel to swingy for their cost.  The game definatly gets more interactive, which is only a partial bonus since it also greatly slows the game play down.

Still a great game, just not quite as good as the original, and not as eager to jump into the new card pool as the origional.

I really enjoy enjoy dominion despite its solitaire like tendencies.  Intrigue is great if you already know you enjoy the game and have a friend who has the base set. It comes with the base set cards, but if you don't have access to the first base set, I would recommend it first.  Intrigue is certainly more complicated and harder for someone new to deck building games to "get" at first. It can be great for the more gamer minded groups but is not for someone who is constantly introducing people to games. (at least not without first acquiring the base game)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Dominion is easily my favorite game of all my collection. It is the game all deck-buildings games wish they were. I have to say that I am not an enthusiast of card games (I'm more of a boardgame gamer myself), but this one is simply fantastic. There is not that much luck, and a lot of strategy, all packed in a thirty-40 minute game. 
Then why do I only give it an 8.5? Because you will get tired of it if you only have one box. You need at least 2.5 boxes (there are small expansions) for it to get real sweet. Although the boxes will start taking a lot of space, and it is a bit cumbersome to carry. Try any of the good ideas given by other bgg'ers!
Dominion intrigue is one of the two stand-alone Dominions, and it is clearly more replayable than the base set, which is pretty straigt-forward as far as strategies go.

Dominion, 2008
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

From the back of the box: "Something’s afoot. The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret, or like you think he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you’re sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs, “The eggs are on the plate.” You frantically search your codebook for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent. Everything is going according to plan."

Dominion: Intrigue adds rules for playing with up to 8 players at two tables or for playing a single game with up to 6 players when combined with Dominion. This game adds 25 new Kingdom cards and a complete set of Treasure and Victory cards. The game can be played alone by players experienced in Dominion or with the basic game of Dominion.

Great Hall is our favourite card. 

My primary school aged kids and I typically use an App to randomly select the Kingdom cards, then we can each swap one card for another card that we'd prefer to see. This allows variety while also tending to fill in any gaps in card types and limit the attack cards (which my daughter hates).

Most of the cards in Intrigue are a little more complex than the base set, so for those like me who were so used to the base game, playing with this set requires some gameplay adjustments.  Also because of the added complexity, playing with the Intrigue set is not as snappy and streamlined as with the base set, and the games tend to run longer.

For those looking for more however, Intrique is an excellent addition.

(Note that these comments refer to the first edition of Intrigue, which came with a full set of Treasure and Victory cards, plus all the other core components. If you're new to Dominion now, you'll want the want the [thing=209418]second edition core set[/thing] before getting [thing=209419]the new Intrigue[/thing], which is purely an expansion.)

The core set is great, but it was Intrigue that made me a Dominion fan for life. I love the cards that give you a choice of effect (the Minion, etc.), as well as Victory cards that can actually be used for things (e.g., the Noble and the Harem). I think I actually prefer Intrigue to the original set, although the latter is still the place to start.

We've played one 6-player game, and it was fine. This is an easy enough game that you can't slow it down too much. Still, 2-4 players remains the sweet spot.

Recorded plays are for games using only Intrigue cards, recommended sets from the Intrigue rules, and for 5-6 player games.

See Dominion for more background. This expansion strikes me as, literally, "intriguing." The extra player interaction with the new cards takes care of one of my "sadnesses" (I can't say gripes) with Dominion - that buying money tends to be more important than buying the action cards. It also makes the game take longer. I really hate the Swindler card, but I've got a whole forum thread about that. 

Overall, I find that using this expansion in combination with the original Dominion is the way to go. If they were one game together, I'd probably rate them a 9.25.

First - why are my comments and plays here, rather than on Dominion proper?  Well, that's because my son owns the original.  Granted, at the time of this writing he is 12, but eventually he will go away to college and take his games with him.  D:I, on the other hand, is my game.

Dominion is a great game. It has its interactions without being too confrontational.  The card play combinations are very interesting, and with several more kingdom cards in the box than are used in any one game, the replayability is high.

A nine rating from me on this one is somewhat surprising.  I normally like very thematic games.  But where this game has almost no theme, it makes up for it in great play.

Nice expansion, which works as a stand-alone game too. If you're not interested in buying all the expansions to come, get first Dominion instead. It's more balanced and easier to teach for newbies.

I have Dominion base game, Alchemy and Prosperity as well but I will log all plays one Intrigue since its the one I got first. I usually also decide cards out of all the ones I own.

I like Dominion, I find it to be quite a relaxing game. There are of course strategy to be had in there but it's not as taxing as many of the other games that I own. I'm a bit on the fence about Alchemy, given a choice I would probably have had the big box come with another expansion instead of that one.

It seems I only have two modes when it comes to this game; either I get obsessed with it and play it all the time or I'm annoyed with it because of stuff like "Big Money" etc and don't want to play it at all. Of all the games I own I think this one fluctuates the most in popularity.

Bought the update kits for basegame and Intrigue.

Some people complain that the Dominion base set isn't interactive enough. That's certainly a point that is remedied by this expansion. It contains a lot of cards which directly impact other players' decks, usually not in a good way.

It looks like the target has been missed by a mile, though. If we had played a random setup and ended up with a bad mix that would at least be understandable. We did, however, play one of the recommended setups, and it was completely unplayable. No control whatsoever. If you were lucky you got to use a useful card once before it was downgraded, destroyed, stolen, or morphed into something completely different. Countermeasures were not available. Great fun. Not.

Making the construction of the deck the primary mechanic of the game was a stroke of genius. The shared supply of cards makes this title incredibly strategic. Its modular structure makes it easy to play over and over again.
Perfect for 3. Good with 2.

More interactions than dominion, which I don't own but have already play several times. This game is interesting during the discovery phase (seeing new cards, making combos, aso), but I'm not sure interest will long survive. I don't have this feeling when playing RftG, for example. Anyway, that's a game my gf and father agree to play (previous game was settlers of catan...), and that's enough to make me happy to have follow the hype and buy it.

I don't like the complex action cards. Dominion is not about making decisions when you're playing a card, Dominion is about reading a strategy from the 10 action cards on the table. This expansion slows the game down by upsetting the flow of play while everybody figures out what sort of penalty they're taking this time. I decided I didn't want to ever suggest these cards, so traded the game away.

I think this is a game worth owning not just because it's so different from everything else, but because it's about how to build an economic engine that will help you rake in the victory points, while being a race game at the same time. "When do I stop getting money so that I can start grabbing victory points?". It's important to be able to adapt to different combination of cards on the table, and there can be a variety of paths to victory.

This is a must have. It doubles as a stand-a-lone game or an expansion to the first. The cards add a ton of more options to the original and some more player interaction and the possibility to play with more players. If you liked the first, then you will love this.

Thanks to my friends Josh, Dave and Chris for introducing this game to me and teaching me how to play.

Multiplayer solitaire that is repetitive, unexciting, fiddly, and too long for its own good (esp. with saboteur cards).

How do people get a sense of sharing a game experience with other people in this one?

As an expansion, Intrigue is great because it adds the much needed player interactions to the base game. Moreover, tougher tradeoffs have to be made by each player when certain cards are played.

When combined with the base set, Intrigue can allows up to 6 players in a single game.

The downside is that some of the new "attack" cards are way too chaotic and can totally mess up your plan. I think it is at the borderline of getting too random.

I prefer using Intrigue as an expansoin, adding a few Intrigue cards to the base set, rather than playing Inrigue as a standalone game. 

However, Intrigue does generate much more laughters than the basic Dominion.

Bottomline: more fun but less strategic.

[b]Dominion Intrigue[/b] [i]Donald X Vacarinno 2009[/i]
A new Dominion version that is playable by itself, but an expansion at the same time (and honestly I think it shouldnt have the status of an independent entry in the ranks). Anyway, I think that Intrigue is a tad better than the core game in the meaning that it offers a more interactive and complex experience. But that also means complexity and thus more playing time and it is also a bit more unreacheable for the newbies. I recommend to play Dominion core game first and, if you like it, add later some Intrigue cards. In short, Intrigue is a game for the people that liked the core game and are willing to add some spice and interaction in their games. The cost is downtime, but I think it deserves a place on my shelves.

Obviously this is the expansion that opened this whole thing up.  Just so many amazing cards.  It's hard to think about the game without the cards contained in this expansion.

I will say, however, that advertising the ability to play with 2 extra people is sort of stupid.  It's just not a 6 player game.  If you have 6 people, play 2 3p games of dominion.

Note that I'm rating this as a Dominion expansion, not a standalone game.

I don't like the extreme randomness of the Saboteur.  If you want to buy a super-volatile card for yourself, that's fine.  But when you're doing it to someone else's deck, it can take some of the fun out of the game for many players.  Otherwise, this is a great set of cards that really fulfills the initial promise of Dominion.  Basic Dominion was all about which cards to purchase, with very few other decisions to be made.  With the addition of the Intrigue cards, players will often have interesting decisions to make during the actual card play.  That makes the game more satisfying for me.  Simply doubling the number of cards does a lot for Dominion, by creating a much broader array of novel and challenging card interactions.

You want to play five player dominion, even though you know it't not going to work. 
It doesn't. 
But, because you keep lending your copy of Dominion to everyone, and they never give it back (let's face it. This game is like crack) you'll always have Intrigue around to scratch that itch, because it has a full set of beginner cards right there in the box. 
Of course, it also allows you to expand the game from four to eight players. 
You could go ahead and play an eight player game.
You could. But that doesn't mean you should.
Oh, doing it anyway?  
Even though I told you not too? 
Go on, bastardize Dominion for all to see. Sully it's good name by making a travesty of the quick, "it's your turn already" game play.
You sick-o.
I hope you're happy with yourself.

My first experience with it was with saboteur and swindler with newbies. The game took long time to finish and felt random. The reason behind this they did not play strategically and were not experienced gamers. I will never introduce those cards anymore. Like treasure map in seaside, the saboteur can strike very differently depending how the game turns out and it is hard to defend against it.

Generally, I like the cards in this set. The main game grew a little stale with the same combos all the time. New cards infused new strategies and many of these cards have options in it.

There is an option to play five or six player games and I have done that a few times, but nothing I really enjoy. You have to be more careful when having more players and choosing the kingdom cards, since some cards (especially attacks) can be quite powerful in this environment.

Having played a lot of Dominion, if I was to start all over again, I'd begin with Intrigue. It's such an excellent "next step" beyond the original, and I feel it has more replayability than the base set because of the options given by several of the cards. It's not earth-shattering originality (at least not by today's standards), but it brought so much more to the original that I'd rather begin here and then add a few cards from the base set were I to re-collect everything bit by bit.

Intrigue is a great addition to any Dominion set. The cards add some great interaction as well as many choices. Definitely a way to spice up any kingdom setup. The only problem I have with this set is that it doesn't work well as a stand alone. 

I have yet to try out the 5 or 6 player game, however, so someday we'll see if that affects the high score I've provided in any way.

A more brutal and competitive version of Dominion.  A fine place to start, but honestly I prefer basic Dominion more.  A lot of the cards and combos just don't do it for me as much.

After one play it seems to be a very good expansion. The added variety make it great. I also think that the complaints that it makes the game take much longer aren't for my mind relevant, I see it as a good thing that there is added playing time as it means that more strategy can be developed and the gameplay is more rewarding, particularly as dominion has a large set-up time anyway, so it is good to get some more meaty play.

It's a more-complicated version of the original.  The new cards are interesting and well-done.My biggest concern is that the newer cards seem to just be more powerful than the old ones, and they seem to lead to even more absurdly powerful chaining.  I've seen people have buy two Provinces in the same turn and still have money buys leftover that they didn't use.  The rules for five and six players seem to work, but I don't really like the game with more than four; oddly enough, it makes the game seem more hectic and even MORE of a solo game.

This expansion adds enough victory, curse and treasure cards to be able to play with more than 4 players.  Supposed to be a stand-alone game, but I don't think I would have liked it as much if I had started playing with this set.  Not as strong as Seaside,with cards that center on more interaction with other players and giving choices of what can be done with the cards.  Cards like Masquerade (pass a card to the left) are especially good for the "random" player that just likes to do things so they can say, "Let's see what happens when I do this!"

It obviously addresses the "multiplayer solitaire" complaints about the original game. It does add a lot of direct interaction between players, but in a bad way. Such interaction is usually very random and destructive, forcing other players to trash cards and to take unwanted cards into their decks. It turns what was boring into annoying. As a "bonus", now you have some ugly and inconsistent artwork. Simply awful!

Better than the original base set, which is great already. Some of the card combos get a little wacky, but overall great game. 

--Upon further reflection, I've decided I don't like this set as much as the original. I still like it, but there are a number of cards I almost refuse to play with and others I'm just not that excited about, I don't go out of my way to make sure Intrigue cards make my games. Still fun, but in a comparative setting I give the base set a slight nod.

This adds some much wanted diversity in the base game, which is hugely positive point. The problem is that it also adds to the logistical problems of putting the cards in some kind of container, where they can be easily reached. I use sleeves for easier shuffling, so the box doesn't work and CCG binders have too small pockets. Photograph pocket binder pages are large enough, so I use them for now, but they are a little too big resulting in card-valanches if you are not careful. Also, these start to take too much space in a backpack for a filler game.

I still like to play this, but I rarely use my own version anymore.

RATING: 7
Intrigue is okay.  I especially like the introduction of dual-type cards (Action/Victory cards are especially good).  Scout works well with Great Hall, Nobles, and even Harem, and would probably work well with other expansions with these dual-type cards.

Because there are a full set of Victory and Treasure cards in the box, it's possible to play with Intrigue and true expansions (without the base Dominion game).  In general, I'd say that the base game is better -- Village is better than Mining Village, and there's nothing as good as Market or Festival or even Chapel in this release.

Some cards give you many choices (like Pawn).  For only 2 coins, Pawn is quite a flexible and powerful card; with a +2 actions card like Shanty Town or Mining Village, the Pawn can be quite good (choose +1 Card, +1 Coin, for example).  However, this is actually a pain -- it's hard to keep track of what choices were used for each played instance of this type of card.

Intrigue has a bunch of vicious attack cards, and even cards that are not Attack cards (and so can't be defended against by a Blue card like Moat or Secret Chamber) but which still affect other players (like Masquerade).  One card is truly evil -- Saboteur.  I hate playing with this one -- it can unfairly attack a losing player who has barely managed to get enough treasure in a turn to get one Province in their deck, for example.  Maybe it should only be played with Remodel and Moat in play.

By all means this is a great game and gives good variety from the original, I just didn't enjoy the game as much as I thought I would or should.

Dominion isn't really complete without Intrigue. While I'm not particularly intrigued (hurhur) by the thought of getting more expansions, this one was a must-buy. It adds more cards with interactions between players, a bit backstabbing if I may say so, and IMHO that's much needed to make the game a bit less dry and solo-is.

A notable mention to the inlay again. It's great.

Nevertheless, this is for trade. It just doesn't see enough table time, and I'd rather play other games, too.

We always enjoy the Dominion sets. Always something different depending on the kingdom cards that are selected. We usually start with a random pick and then change out a few each game. It's a rare occassion when we don't play at least three games of this in one sitting.

Intrigue has some cards in it that let you mess with your fellow players and definitely give you some interesting options depending on the combination of kingdom cards that are on the table.

This is a great “expansion”.  Actually, it is probably not officially considered an expansion (since you can play it by itself without the original Dominion), but we treat as such, since it is essentially another (very nice) collection of additional cards.  It provides a variety  of new (25 or so action and victory) cards.  While I cannot think of any completely new concept they introduced with this expansion (like the “duration” mechanism introduced in Seaside), some of the cards provide more interaction with other players.  Some of the others provide a choice on what action(s) to take.  For example, Steward lets you choose one of the following:  (1) draw 2 extra cards, (2) receive 2 extra coin to go towards a purchase, or (3) trash 2 cards from your hand (handy for when you have curses).

And while there are few cards in the previous expansion (Seaside) that my family and I never choose (we have our own way of “randomizing” the 10 action piles), I cannot think of any card that does not get used at least every once in a while (although, now that I think about it, I suppose we rarely use “Shanty Town” and “Wishing Well” any more).

Oh, and there is one other benefit that I alluded to at the beginning.  This game comes with a new set of treasure and victory cards.  These are the same as what is included in the original Dominion game, but this is very nice as it provides a fresh set of these cards that get used (and worn down) often.

In any case, if you like original Dominion, I highly recommend adding Intrigue to your collection.

Depending on the cards there can be limited interaction between players..
First time i played this, i played against a human computer who prolonged the game even though he owned everyone at the table.. with his endless turns taking several minutes to finish.. everyone else was just trying to kill the game by emptying those 3 piles.. luckily i gave it another go with normal people, and that was pleasant.

I enjoy Star Realms better.

Dominion: Intrigue defintiely makes base Dominion more interactive, with more cards to pull items out of others' stacks, and more cards which expend cards from players' decks.

Nevertheless, I'll give this a 7.25 for a lift in interaction, and more variance in card abilities.

Played it for the first time at a meetup tonight. Fascinating new cards to explore. Intrigue has a number of cards that allow more trashing, more interaction with the other players, and dual-purpose cards, such as victory+treasure or victory+action.

Because of these new cards, the game seems 'klunky'. It's not as smooth as the base game, or perhaps it is simply because it is my first game? We'll see how this grows on me over the coming weeks. Incidentally, the base game rarely comes out now.

Update (09/12/09) 5x F2F plays: Started random mixing of base and Intrigue cards, for slow introduction of Intrigue cards. Also played 5 Player game for first time.  5P game is admittedly longer, but still fun nonetheless. The new Intrigue cards cannot be ignored, as some of them are simply devastating. It's kind of like evolution: if you learn to use the new cards, they have a good chance of overtaking the old base cards. In the end, it is how one strings together dissimilar cards, or ignoring them completely, from the two sets to work together synergistically that causes a win or loss.

Update (10/24/09): An interesting thing about Dominion is that it is possible for several other players to join a 2-3 player game that just started, and has only gone 3-4 turns in. The late players are given the starting hand, plus a gold, and one or two silvers. This may give enough of boost to catch up with the other players. We have yet to work out the exact numbers, but the games have been close with this catch-up mechanism.

Update (11/28/09): First two-table 4P each session of Dominion+Intrigue, with four newbies. Went over well. First 6P game also. Length depends on type of kingdom cards--with Saboteur, Witch, and Tribute, game ended in 20 minutes with 4 piles emptying out. Scores ranged from -6 to 12 pts. Second 6P game lasted a bit longer. We even modified the ending rules by upping the condition to 5 piles, but this didn't matter. Still having difficulty mastering Intrigue cards, as they are constantly mixing with base cards (we don't play the preset layouts anymore), so this is frustrating. Because of this, Seaside may be my last expansion for a long time--I'm getting off that wagon.

Update (06/18/10): Downing this to a "7". See base game for explanation.

I got to play the prototype at a game convention with a playtester.  This game is a much more thoughtful and deliberate game that the base game.  The cards are very interesting and creative.  Having pretty much mastered the base game at 250+ games, it felt like I was starting over with these cards.  There is a learning curve for sure.  It was a very different game - very enjoyable and fun.  I will purchase this game!

Dropped from an initial 9.5 due to around 150 plays

I stopped buying expansions in 2016 but before that I played every single one multiple times.
Intrigue, Seaside and Prosperity are hands down the best ones by far. The new Features they provide are fun, reasonable and implemented elegantly. Every other expansion ultimately doesn´t.

The cards are more precise and strategic than in regular Dominion and it will take some serious thinking to figure out how they all work best together. The game, however, is really fun and intuitive.

RATING: 7
Very much the same game, a mixed bag of enhancements. There are some more interesting cards this time, especially Nobles (hybrid Action/Victory card) and Harem (hybrid  Treasure/Victory). There is some rather game-jarring clunkiness in among the fresh ideas though, such as Swindler (other players trash the top card from their deck and you choose for them a card of equivalent value) and Saboteur (others turn over cards from their deck until they reach one costing 3+, trash it and choose another costing 2 less) which have the effect of substantially slowing down the game and rather defeat the purpose of a deck-builder, in my mind at least. A reasonable expansion, but some later ones are much better.

I think this is an improvement on the base game; I think the addition of more ways to score victory points makes the game more interesting.  There are some neat variations on the cards too--cards that are more than one type are (including cards that are victory points AND something else), and cards that give you a choice of what you want to do.  The Great Hall is amazing and the Pawn is pretty good too. I don't like the Masquerade as much because it seems to disrupt the premise of the game. Will never play with the Saboteur again.

It may not be the most popular expansion, but I love what this added to the base game. The multi-use Victory cards are my favorite element of this set, but all the other cards which give options add some much-needed depth to the gameplay. This expansion also includes cards with very fascinating effects in the right circumstances, like Coppersmith, Mining Village, and Masquerade. Not a card I don't like.

Cartas con varios efectos a elegir uno.

Es un Dominon "Big Brother" para jugones. Casi una secuela más que una expansión porque reinventa el juego. Las decisiones ahora no están sólo en qué comprar (como en Dominion) sino que también aparecen en qué hacer con las cartas que ahora ofrecen varios efectos de los cuales habrá que elegir uno. Esto hace que la condición que aparecía en mis partidas de "gana el que consigue el primer oro" desaparezca en gran medida. Dura más, pero el juego es más dinámico y siempre se cuenta con el aliciente de tener un 5º o 6º jugador en la partida. Poco amigable con los novatos. PROS: cartas con opciones y más interactivas que eliminan la sensación de "solitario multijugador". CONS: añade más azar, caos y al juego y esto no gusta a todos. Sigue la estela de Magic (más combos gordos, usos alternativos en las cartas...). La interacción sigue siendo algo forzada. Sigue sin gustarme que las monedas tengan el mismo color y los PV's el mismo diseño con independencia de su valor. 

Con tantas expansiones, parece útil jugar con 3 ataques + 1 carta de victoria + 6 cartas de acción. Tantos ataques, dificultan mucho la estrategia big money. La carta de  victoria extra añade más profundidad y hace obligatorio pensar estrategias distintas. Las 6 acciones, mucha rejugabilidad.

For a while, I preferred Intrigue to the original base game, but lately I've been enjoying the original plus one or two expansions.  In fact, for the last few months, I only include Intrigue when playing randomly with ALL my Dominion expansions available... which has recently become the norm (Dec 2011).

The first Dominion expansion introduces several action cards that have different effects from which you must choose: Pawn, Nobles, Steward, Minion. Torturer and Saboteur are two of the nastiest attack cards in the entire series; Swinder can wreak havok in many situations as well.  Nobles and Harem are kewl Victory cards that also have very useful functions during the game.  What can I say, it's awesome, get it!

Slows the base game down more than I'd like. Neat cards but some of the beauty of the base game was its speed and ability to be played multiple times in a row. Now a game takes 45 minutes? Hard to play that 4 or 5 times in a row.

My base dominion game, the person who got our group into gaming owns the original so I started building my collection with Intrigue, I really enjoy it and feel like it adds a nice amount of flavor to the game.  

I do plan on acquiring the base Dominion set but HUGE PROPS go out to Rio Grande Games for putting at least 3 suggested games for each base set in addition to an expansion.  The suggested setups are generally a great way to play, they are balanced and have a nice mix of play styles.

A worthy addition to the base game, and can also be played standalone.  The cards follow a similar framework to the base cards, but some have more interesting effects.  Such as the Duke card which earns a victory point for every duchy in your deck, and the Baron card which allows you to utilise the Estate cards you have in your hand at the start of the game.

The 'Intrigue' part of the title seems to refer to the attacking cards in this expansion, none of which I am particularly find of.  One of them simply makes another player discard two cards - this is just annoying for the other players and often creates a long pause when the AP sets in.  I don't really enjoy this type of negative interaction and I much prefer the other cards that come in this generous addition to an already great game.

Another of the many dominion expansions.  I play with all of them (I have an app that lets me randomly select cards, and I can specify certain sets, or all sets, or choose by many other other criteria).  Anyway, the point is that this makes it is hard for me to rate this separately or in isolation since I don't use it that way.  So, I am giving it a rating of 9, since it adds enjoyment to the brilliant base game but isn't a necessity, other expansions are good too.

Dominion was fun for a while but at this point I would rather not play it. I can be convinced to play it 2-player on the computer but on the tabletop the setup is a chore for a pretty short 2-player game and the game is a chore with more players.

Got bored and played this a bunch of times on my phone, bascially Dominion with all the expansion thrown in.  Its neat seeing all the different cards but honestly once you know how to play most of them are insulting and just not worth it.  

Play becomes fairly scripted once you realize the quickest way to get Provinces, I am no expect but the results I see seem pretty clear.  Some cards are actually good, and this is what makes it a little interesting, when to buy them (usually obvious) and how many (also obvious). As I mentioned for Dominion to me the game has only one really important and not so obvious decision which is when to start collecting the VP's. 

Good gateway or filler game, just doesn't hold my interest and certainly doesn't have the draw to keep my coming back

I own only the base game.  If you REALLY love it then I think you can go for the expansions, though not necessary.

If the lack of interaction is Dominion's biggest flaw, than Intrigue will fix that in an instant.

This set features a number of cards to interacting and interfering with other players, as well as some cards that begin to provide alternate paths to generating Treasure and Victory cards. As such, it makes a great companion to the base set.

DISCLAIMER: My rating and comments treat this as an expansion and not a stand-alone game; it assumes ownership of the base set. I have not tried playing this as a stand-alone set.

Very interesting expansion. Apart from the sheer boost in variety, I like all the multi-use cards, eg. VP cards that also count as money or act as card-drawing action cards. A good expansion - but of course, it's essentially "more of the same". :)

Initial Rating: 8.0 (August 2011)

When you have played Dominion a long time, patterns begin to emerge and one tends to follow the same paths as before. Enter Dominion: Intrigue. It adds a lot more possible card combinations and gives a lot of life to vanilla Dominion, all with very little extra complexity. It also offers a lot more interaction between players (which increases luck). If you like Dominion this is a must.

Without a doubt Dominion is the best deck building game out there.

I consider it a Dominion Expansion, not a standalone game.

I prefer to play this over the internet due to the constant shuffling.

To this day, I continue to love Dominion. For me, it is still the king of the deckbuilders (many copycats didn’t grasp what made Dominion great), so it is no wonder than I like Dominion: Intrigue. I don’t have anything negative to say about the game. If someone pointed a gun to my head and made me find a flaw in the game it would be the card Saboteur. Perhaps the card I like the least in all the Dominion world. I found it amplifies the controlled luck to uncontrollable levels. I hate to play with it, but sometimes I do. I always play with random sets.

As I wrote before, Dominion is best if you can play it online (due to the shuffling), however I won’t say no to a game of Dominion (face to face or virtual). It’s a shame Goko didn’t deliver on its promises because this is the game I most want to play online on my iPad. Also I have bought all the physical cards and the virtual counterparts are very expensive on their website, so for now, I’m not playing online. 

For me Dominion is a two player game only. With more players the luck and the downtime begin to creep up to unmanageable levels.

One of 2009´s favorites.

Current Rating: 9.5

RATING: 7
The set appears more complex than the base game, which is a good thing.  I especially like the cards that combine card types, like the Harem and Great Hall, and the Duke which makes Duchies a viable primary path to victory.

Unfortunately the set adds two deck-destruction attacks, Saboteur and Swindler, which increases to three the number of Kingdom cards I'm not willing to play with.  That makes it more difficult to find a good game of Dominion in practice.

I probably won't be buying Intrigue though; the base game flamed out relatively quickly for me so I'm not eager to invest more money quite yet.  Perhaps if I didn't have to buy more treasure and victory point cards I might take the plunge.

I have only had one person tell me they think soso about this game for the rest like me this game is just perfect. Ive had people after simply one play go out and buy the game for them selves so much they liked it. Its a crowed pleaser no doubt about it. It hits the table pretty often being on average a 45min game. I would say the only time it doesnt hit the table atleast once during the night is cause were 5 and its a 4 player game! but no worries the game wouldnt work with 5 since i found it is best with 3

One of the first tabletop games I got into at college. I was always willing to play this and my group was as well. Fun game to drink during and screwing people over with some of the attack cards is rewarding. Love this game but not the deckbuilder I'd go with first anymore. If the rest of the group wants to play I'll happily oblige.

RATING: 10
More than an expansion, it plays extremely well (equal to the original, IMO) as a stand-alone game.  "Fixes" the complaints on the original that there isn't enough interaction and that the play of the hand is automatic.

Interaction is the raison detre of this game, with the addition of 4 new attack cards, a new reaction card, and three other cards that are not attacks, but require actions from other players.  Also, many of these cards do much more to interfere not only with opponents' current or next turns, but also with the composition of their decks.

Hand play is also intensified with well over half of the cards requiring a choice to be made as part of card play, or requires a risk to be taken as part of the decision whether or not to play a card at all.

Increases the length of the game somewhat in proportion to the number of "Intrigue" cards included in a 10 card action deck, as many of the cards require thought to play and/or react to.

The thing I loved about Dominion was the "make my deck awesome with skill" part, not the "make everyone deck and strategy terrible" part. I heavyily dislike this expansion, and recommend that if your least favorite cards in base were the witch and the thief, DON'T EVER BUY THIS.

If they were your favorites, I dislike you strongly, and you should buy this.

In Dominion: Intrigue, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can "buy" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

Intrigue adds some welcome layers of strategy and more meaningful player interaction to the base set. The greatest strength of this set is including cards with multiple options.

Tough to say if I like Seaside over this expansion.  Intrigue added cards so you can have more players, plus it added a slew of cards that have multiple uses.

Dominion took a long time to grow on me and had its ups and downs from initial interest played with other newbies to disappointment when confronted with experienced players to liking it again after climbing the learning curve to a reasonable level.
Intrigue is more goodness but initial impression is a bit below the base game as the confrontation and chaos factor is increased with the Saboteur bothering me particularly. On the positive side, the cards giving a choice of actions add more decision-making and the combined points cards make early points strategies viable.

Some Attack cards are maybe a little bit too cruel. Especially Saboteur and to a lesser extent Swindler.

Gal kiek žiaurokos kai kurios atakos. Ypač Saboteur ir gal kiek mažiau Swindler. Tiesa, yra ir įdomių kortelių - ypač tos su įvairiais pasirinkimais. Na, tikiuosi aš dar prie jo priprasiu, nes kol kas man pagrindinis žaidimas ir Prosperity patinka labiau.

Finally picked this up to add more variety to my dominion plays. With this and dominion I might have my first to 10/10 games... I doesn't matter how much I play this I will play it again if given the chance... if that holds up for the next month, I'm bumping it up.

Only one card should never be used: The Saboteur. As a friend of mine stated (and I agree), "It turns Dominion into Mario Party."


My only problem at this point is Dominion has ran its course with me - I mean the attacks cards are hardly fun anymore. Making a concise fun deck of cards with all the expansions is pretty unwieldy... It is a great game, but I have very little reason to care to play this anymore.

A great addition to my Dominion collection. This game brings a lot of interaction to a game whose only flaw was that it lacked interaction.

The only bad thing about the game is the cartoony, out-of-theme artwork on some cards (Harem, yuck).

More Dominion, basically. It's not so bad rushing through games on the computer to see what happens, but it does kind of press home that I wouldn't want to play this with people if anything else were available. Most annoying card: Saboteur.

The first expansion that is also a base set.

Unified with the core set, you can have more than 4 players game, though it is quite slow.

In my opinion it is far better core set that the original if you cannot purchase both.

Saboteur is a nasty card.

Makes the "autopilot-mode" much harder to achieve. And that's a good thing. The new cards in action combos most certainly will make player turns last longer, but they give you a better chance to "recover" and adapt if things are slowly turning against you. And best of all, they give you more options to hurt your opponents with. Overall feel: Better than the original.

I like it slightly less than "vanilla" Dominion. Reason is quite simple, lot of cards have special texts and all in all it plays slower (only bit) and is not flowing so well and so smoothly. Games I played were longer than I wanted them.

A sweet set of Dominion cards, and a standalone expansion to boot for the same price as the other full size expansions.  I have since lent out my base set, and I can't say I miss it much.  I would still recommend base Dominion to newbies, but if you've played it already and like it, or have a friend with the base set, this is a great one to start with (unless you plan on trying to teach other newbies or use it as a gateway game).

I got this game as a gift after playing the original Dominion. However i never actually played the game as the base set came out every time and we never required further cards and expansions.

Update, December 2011.  Really plays well with Dominion alone.  The two games together have some great card combinations.  Once you learn some of the tricks by playing several hands, you can figure out some good combinations.  And with the short playing time, it's easy to gain the experience needed to learn those combinations.

Adds more variety to Dominion.  I like the dual VP-action cards like the Nobles.

More yummy Dominion goodness. The Dominion world will start to suck as they add more and more expansions with more and more gimicks and schticks, I feel sure, but it ain't there yet. This first expansion adds some neat stuff.

Loses half a point for Swindler and especially Saboteur. Adds too much to the Dominion experience to lose more than that.

Not recommended for those that don't like Dominion, natch.

Dominion was the best Deck Builder when it was the only Deck Builder.  Pretty much anything else I find more enjoyable now, particularly the reworked Thunderstone Advance (Which looks like it might be reworked yet again).  A Dominion base set might still be good for introducing someone new to Deck Building, just as it was for all of us but I'd probably still skip it and pick something with more theme (Trains?).

RATING: 9
A nice stand-alone expansion to Dominion that adds a number of cool cards. I think everyone should own the base game though as it's much easier to teach to non-gamers (games that I can easily get non-gamers involved in is a huge plus for me), and Intrigue has cards like Saboteur that can drive new players bonkers.

I think this makes for a good first expansion as it adds just the sort of decisions that the base game wanted more of, and many Intrigue cards feel like they have more use when you are playing with a higher proportion of other Intrigue cards.

I liked the interaction in Intrigue, but this game was too light for my gaming group and had too much screwage to be played with my family. I do think that the entire Dominion family of games are about memorizing the optimum combos from the available stacks of cards, which is disappointing. This just makes it a deck-building bean counter. These days I much prefer Fantastiqa.

While it's a little more adversarial than Dominion, a larger percentage of the cards seem to be built with more than 2 players in mind, weakening the core of the game.  However while that diminishes the game slightly, overall it's perfect to add onto the original game.

On its own, I don't like: the abundance of attacks increases downtime and gives Dominion a weird feeling, as it's clear it wasn't designed to be a confrontation-heavy game. Not to mention how many great confrontation-based games are out there in the wild.

Said that, when diluted with cards from other sets, Intrigue is a very good addition.

This expansion does a good job of offer choice to the players. 

It somewhat ameliorates my issues with vanilla dominion which is, bar your card purchase, there is little choice for meaningful strategy. Instead by allowing you to do a. OR b. it makes the manner with which you play the cards far more meaningful.

I shan't be playing dominion without this expansion, ever.

There are a few nasty attacks in this one. I find Minion to be a 'buy it or lose' card. I usually don't mind my opponents buying saboteur since I find it weak, but it is swingy and it really hurts to lose 2 provinces in 2 turns to them, as has happened to me more than once. Swindler can be swingy too but that is more dependent on the board.

Intrigue adds some interesting elements to the base game of Dominion.  However, considered on its own, it doesn't seem as balanced.  It has a lot of complex, slowing elements, as well as more randomizing effects.  Games can drag on quite a bit or finish up pretty rapidly (though not always predictably).  There are a lot of Intrigue-only setups that players will see and dread playing, which was a bit rarer with the base set.  Combined, the distribution is a bit better.

RATING: 8
A refreshing addition to Dominion, in terms of game mechanics.

Some cards lengthen the game, compared to the base game (Saboteur…), and, when present, they make the game drag too much, for us (the percentage of time spent thinking was too low, for a game that lasts as long as Race for the Galaxy).  However, most of the cards are not like this.

Downgraded to 9 because I find that Puzzle Strike has a few advantages over Dominion.

RATING: 10
If you're considering which one to get, a base Dominion or Dominion: Intrigue - go with the latter one. Much better and more "intriguing" decks. And it's not really an expansion, since you can play it on its own.

By far, the least favorite Dominion expansion I own. None of the cards are super special or make the gameplay so much better. The only plus is that it comes with victory point and money cards so it can be played on its own. I am definitely looking to trade or sell in the future.

I own the original and got this for my brother in law so eventually we could mix and match.  I always heard Intrigue had more interaction and was more cuthroat and its true, its great!

A great entry deck builder, I prefer the Intrigue set to the original Dominion as it requires a player to develop a more interesting strategy.

Attacking purely mitigates players and it more detrimental to yourself.
The extensibility of the game essentially adds layers of complexity.

Love the depth this adds to the base game.  Also it's stand-alone.

The ONLY downside is lots of the cards have choices, so you have to think more carefully about how you want to use them.  Also some of them appear a little weak.  And some of them just are weak.  But still a great set in terms of the average usability of each card.

This is the Megaman 2 of the board-game world: A polished and timeless expansion, upon an imperfect base game. A close third-favorite expansion, behind only Dark Ages and Hinterlands (and that's saying a lot!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cards have a lot more text than the base game, making this less suitable as a gateway game. I feel like because the base set was simpler the cards in Intrigue take a little bit more finesse to use properly.

EDIT after playing all the other expansions: By itself, Intrigue feels kind of clunky to me. Base game's cards are much simpler yet seem to combo easier together, while Intrigue's seem like you need more pieces, while having more disruptive attacks and having a weaker reaction card to protect yourself. However, I have really liked how Intrigue has integrated with other sets. Unlike other sets who usually have cards that work well together and do a bit more poorly when diluted, Intrigue has cards that splash just as well within the expansion as out of. Also, the finesse needed to use the cards adds more tactical decisions in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The deckbuilding games just got boring real quick and the original is no exception. Glad I have this for the occasional play but the superiority of the gold strategy (proven against players who have played hundreds of games) really makes all other cards and combos irrelevant.  

A great game that incorporates deckbuilding will come out of this Dominions dominated era though and then we can rejoice.

Good quick game. The concept of the game is really interesting but I really find that the theme is boring and bland. 

There is not a lot of choice each turn except which card to buy. But Intrigue is better in this regard than plain Dominion because some cars in intrigue offers choice of action.

Many prefer this game to base Dominion, but I am not among them.  I do see the appeal in this game, and I do in fact like it a lot.  However, if you own only one Dominion, I would go with the original and treat Intrigue instead as an expansion (even if, you know, it isn't.)  What Intrigue does is it makes many of the tactical decisions more complex (fixing a complaint for many who felt that hands played themselves) and changes the victory conditions somewhat (not actually changing the rules, but you are far more likely to draw out with Intrigue than buy up the Provinces).  A good addition to to the series, but not a replacement core set.

Plenty of good stuff here, though some cards that I downright dislike, like Minion, and others that slow things down too much, like Tribute and Saboteur.  But the victory point cards are all winners in their own way, as are things like Coppersmith, which open up entirely new directions.

2/2010 The cards in this expansion are more complex with more options and possibilities. Use the base game for introduction then move swiftly on to the expansions.  Stay clear of the no-interaction setups for introduction as they quickly become booring and solitare.

5/2010 Further play haven't shown further depth.  The game consept is too solitare, and the little interaction is mostly one-way and not inter-active nor subtle enough.  Intrigue is the better box at 8 while basic Dominion is a 7 at best.

Generally the extra variety of cards help, but there are a few really bad ones in this set (eg pawn) that give players choices during their turn which slows the game to a crawl an also are a pain to remember what options you chose when it comes to buying.

I felt this made our Dominion games actively worse due to the overuse of modular cards. Several cards with lots of choices within the text added downtime to a game that really can't afford it. Moreover, they really shine a light on the themeless play. Art is not my cup of tea. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a brilliant expansion to a brilliant game, which addresses many of the perceived flaws in the orginial. Cards offer more choices, making each player's turn less "automatic", and the new types of victory cards make the "3 empty piles" ending much more common. I consider this a must-have.

Dominion introduced the mechanic of deck building. It really needs a theme though, you could easily have put pictures of toilets or farm animals on the cards, the theme is non existent. Draw hand, buy a card that helps throw all of your cards down and get "money" and then buy a green card. Most overrated game on BGG.

Love this expansion.  Really interesting choices (and "choices" happens to be the theme for this expansion).  Cards count as two things (points and coin, or actions and points).

Great stuff.

Dominion is an EXCELLENT game! If you can count you can play. With 25 decks in the base game and four expansions totally over 100 decks the replayability is incredible! You play play with 10 decks at a time, I can't even do the math on how many different configurations there are.
It is a deck building game, you slowly build your own deck. Each turn you get one buy, a chance to spend your treasure on new cards. And one action to play an action card, these include picking up more cards, or getting extra buys.
This is one of my all time favourite games!

RATING: 9
Almost as good as the original.  More player interaction in this set, which can alternate between fun (Minion) and annoying (Swindler).

I don't understand why this has a higher rating on BGG than the Dominion base game, though.  It's not as good, and I think it could be frustrating for players rather than fun if you played with these cards all the time instead of the base game cards.

Love the game and like the expansion a lot, though I don't love the game with 5 or 6 players.  Too much downtime, which takes away one of Dominion's great strengths.  I haven't played it with big groups like that too often though, so maybe I need more playtesting of the big group Dominion.  The other plus/minus about this expansion is that the choices make it harder for my daughter to play the game.

Intrigue does exactly what it should do: adds to Dominion in interesting ways without needlessly complicating things, going off in a wildly different direction, or otherwise fucking things up.

The new cards are great, and they mix well with the base set. This is a must-have expansion; I haven't tried it as a standalone game.

Not as fond of the Intrigue cards as the original set.  My wife's first comment was, "Oh so this is how they make an easy game difficult".

She didn't like the more complicated text-based cards. Tended to slow down play when people had to remind themselves how to play out a card.

Liked the dual purpose victory point/action cards though.

Great game.  Prefer it to the base version of Dominion as there are more options for screwage - a greater number of cards that can sabotage opponents. 

Some of the art sucks big time - I'm looking at you, Shanty Town and Harem.  The Simpsons style cartoon art just doesn't fit with the rest of the art in the set.

My preferred entry point to the Dominion system.  If you like it then you can always buy the big box which includes the Base and two expansions.

Plays quickly and doesn't outstay its welcome.

My wife's favourite game at one point.

This adds a lot to the base game.  The major complaints that some people seem to have about the Dominion base game (not enough interaction & your hand is auto-play) have been addressed.

If you are new to Dominion, I think you would be better served by getting the base game first and adding Intrigue later rather than playing Intrigue as a standalone game (which is possible).  The cards in this set lack some of the "plainer" powers of those in the base set, and I like having some of those plainer powers in the game.

While not quite as exciting as Seaside, Intrigue is certainly a good expansion for Dominion.  It adds some new decision-making cards and different strategy options, but it doesn't quite add the pure excitement and variation that you get with Seaside.  However, it pairs well with Prosperity, and the many of the cards are worthwhile to mix in with the other expansions for a change of pace and more interesting decisions.  This wouldn't be my top choice for a Dominion expansion, but it's still solid and worth playing.

Game in a Nutshell: Just like Dominion with all new cards to build your deck.

Played as: 4 player

Played with: Mixed in with base Dominion only.

Pros: Has most all the positives of the base game with the addition that I think the designer put some more effort into the decks having a stronger interactive element. Points go to the publisher also for choosing to make this a stand alone game by adding the appropriate cards needed to do so.

Cons: On the flip side, some of the simplicity of the base game was lost while coming up with ideas for new cards.

Other: If deciding one or the other between this and base Dominion, it's basically a little trade off of simple accessibility vs a bit more player interaction. Really, you couldn't go very wrong with either one and then there's always the option of having both.

Best Use: Grab if you want to play Dominion with a touch more interaction.

The real challenge of Dominion lies in deciding which cards to buy.  But once you've bought them, the cards tend to play themselves.  There is little to actually think about when playing the hand you're dealt.

Intrigue adds a breath of fresh air with the mechanic of choice.  Cards may be played to give more cards, more actions, more buys, or sometimes a combination.  This makes each hand more flexible and can give cards extended life, as they have an important place in both the early and late game.  Great expansion.

[i]Play comments are listed under Dominion base game[/i]

01/12/2013: See my comments under the Dominion base game for my thoughts on the general gameplay and quality.

This is the only expansion I own, as of this writing.  It can be played alone though, as it does come with all of the standard money and victory point cards needed in any session of Dominion.

From my experience, Intrigue specifically address the lack of player interaction "issue" with the base set.  To me, it's not a big deal.  However, there are very few cards that directly involve the other players when using just the base set of cards.  Intrigue adds many, many cards that will interact with the other players on the table...discard cards, trash (discard permanently) cards, steal cards, etc.  If you want to have others involved more in your turn, then this is a good set to add to your Dominion set up.

However, depending on which Intrigue cards and how many there are compared to the number of base cards in the game, this could cause two things: play length can increase just because there is more going on each turn and you can lose any random card (including large victory points) due to just a random draw of your deck.  This can be a little frustrating when you have a "good" deck of cards that builds up your victory point total, and then because someone else played a card where you have to trash a card from your deck, 6VP are lost for no real reason.

Generally, we play with five random cards from each of the sets I have, and more often than not, things are fun and not too randomly decided.  But it does happen on occasion.  Overall, this is a good addition to the base as it adds even more variety and fun to a very solid game.

Yep. Don't see any reason to rate this differently from the original... there's more going on, and yes for the most part that makes it longer, but I think that's a reasonable trade-off for a more interesting game. In particular, Gold not being an automatic buy on $6 is a good thing.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/423502/dominion-intrigue-intriguingly-complex]Dominion: Intrigue Review: Intriguingly Complex?[/url]

This is the first expansion to [GAMEID=36218].  It is also listed as a stand alone game, which is why it has it's own ranking.  I really like intrigue because it gave me more desire to play dominion again.  I had 150+ plays and was starting to feel like I was playing the same game.  With intrigue there is a lot that mixed that up.

In intrigue, just as dominion, all players start with 7 copper cards, worth one coin each, and 3 estate cards, worth one vp each.  The object is to use the 10 kingdom cards in play to build the most efficient deck that will get you the most vps by the end of the game.  In dominion all vp cards were dead cards in your hand, but intrigue has added 4 different vp cards, 3 of which actually help you during the game, two of them are actions, and one of them is treasure.  The game comes with 25 kingdom cards, as does dominion, to choose your 10 from.  We usually do this randomly, and they have supplied one extra card for each deck to shuffle in order to do this.  They also have some pre-defined setups, or you can come up with any method you want for getting the 10 cards to play with.

I really like the interaction that intrigue provides.  It definitely has more than dominion.  Most people say this is just more luck being added to the game and it hurts the concept.  However, I feel it is a good change of pace.  I also like the options on the cards, there are now more hard decisions to be made more often.  Some say this means you don't have to build as good of a deck, you just buy this card and it acts like anything you need it to be at any time.  I disagree and think it just means you now have harder decisions to make during your turn, which is one complaint from dominion.

I don't know if I would suggest intrigue as a stand-alone game.  We played it stand alone at first so we would have a better chance of seeing all the new cards, but I really feel like combining the two really gives the best play.  We usually do 5 random cards from each.  Also, the cards are a little more complex for somebody just learning the game.  For those reasons I'd say get dominion first, but definitely look into getting both, because the two together really make the playing experience the best.

I gave this an 8 rating, because there is too much luck for me to rate it any higher.  My most favorite games have less luck involved and I really think the more strategy involved the better the game is in a lot of cases.  This is a great game and as a expansion to the 2009 spiel des jahres winner, you can't go wrong.

Definitely a great set, but not for a beginning gamer, or those fearful of attacks!  Ordered some of the Blank sets and have changes two cards to make the game less ...unpleasant... to myself and some other people I play with.  "Harem" has become "Jeweler", snd "Torturer" has become "Bribe".

Played once.  This is an expansion to Dominion, and the rules are functionally identical.  As with Dominion, this game is thoughtful yet extremely quick.  

This expansion adds a variety of cards, and the set I played with was extremely well thought out.  There are now cards that are both victory points and action/gold cards.  The set also included a card that gave bonus points for each Dutchy (3 VP card) that the player has; this makes a previously not-very-useful card into a highly sought after one, and opens up a second track to victory.

All in all this seems like a great addition, though I need to play with more of the expansion cards to know.

Draft and play cards to improve your deck and collect victory cards for most points.

Plays: More than 500, counting online play against humans.
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: 2-4.
Playing time: 45 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources – action and victory cards. Sometimes conflict, which always affects all opponents equally.
Randomness: Low – card draw, but you decide what cards make up your deck.

Replayability: Very high. Often everyone wants to play again immediately. There are millions of variations because the design is modular, so no game is exactly the same. There is also depth to explore.
Fun: High. Making high value hands is fun. Drawing your entire deck with action cards is even more fun. The endless shuffling is not so fun. Intrigue has slightly more fun cards than the base set.
Memorability: High, you’ll remember the wicked combo that you managed to get off that one time to buy three Provinces and a Duchy. You’ll start remembering the less spectacular ones as well after a while, hoping for your pet cards to appear in the Kingdom next time.

Thematic integration: Strained.
Components: Not so good unfortunately. Cards are good quality, but the art is bland.
Expansions: Expansions in order of increasing complexity/fiddlyness: Hinterlands, Cornucopia, Seaside, Prosperity, Dark Ages, Alchemy. Get Hinterlands first.

Who will like this: Family gamers that want to do a bit more thinking.

Great first impression. Mixed it in with the base game immediately. VP cards that do things are a big deal for me, as are cards with multiple uses. I like that there are more decisions to be made during the action phase now.

I'm logging all plays of Intrigue under the base game since it's expansion. I haven't played it alone nor do I plan to.

I did play it as a standalone at Gen Con (it was set up at one of the tables in the Rio Grande room and we had some time to kill.) It's much better as a supplement to the base game than as a standalone game.

RATING: 5
Ok, yes. The new cards kick much ass - they add some much needed complexity and interaction missing from the basic game. But the same flaw still exists: a player that focuses on a simple cash-upgrade strategy will almost always outpace a player who is exploring some alternative strategy (ex: Duchy + Duke) offered by the new cards. This is a critical flaw! It means the most efficient path to winning is the most boring and simple, and it invalidates the need to even bother purchasing or playing this expansion. Furthermore, after playing a round of this, the owner who brought it informed me that the THIRD expansion is already announced for ESSEN. It seems this is just a high price-tag version of a CCG now. I will certainly play it if others suggest it - it's a nice social game (reminds me more and more of Skip-Bo or Uno) - but in the end I know I will not be purchasing any new expansions for it.
-----------------------------------------

Without continuing to buy expansion after expansion of this, it starts to feel really rote and uninteresting. It's basically Deck: The Shuffling.

RATING: 9
Had we gone the popularly recommended route of starting with Dominion and then going to Seaside, I might not think as highly of Intrigue. It would have just been a little more variety and perhaps felt a bit redundant with the base set.

But in our case, after playing the original a few times, we went out and got Intrigue and played the shit out of it instead. The cards provide more options and are generally more interactive. We simply got more mileage out of this set on its own than I think we would have gotten from the base set, and I recommend it over the original to non-casual gamers who don't think they'll be introducing Dominion to a lot of new people. After this, Seaside added some nice variety, but the base set already seemed stale.

[i]Note: All our plays are now logged here, even if Intrigue itself contributed no Kingdom cards to the board, though I will continue co-logging plays under new expansions until we get to 100 plays on them. Gotta consolidate these somewhere, and Intrigue > Dominion in our world.[/i]

A more complex and interesting version of the nearly flawless original.

second-hand buy

When we played Dominion for the first time years ago, my wife and I felt puzzled: we both disliked the game. What are all these people raving about? We didn't really get it. But since everyone is still enjoying this game after so many years, we should give it a second try. And we did with a second hand copy of the Intrigue set and with more experience with the drafting mechanism after having bought Trains and Valley of the Kings. Now we did like the game, although my wife still has a preference for Trains instead because you can develop yourself more than in Dominion.

This game feels more like filler fodder the more I play it.

From two-ish games with Seaside + Intrigue:

Of two minds on the Dominion expansions; on one hand, they make the straightforward [from what I recall] base game considerably more involved / interesting, but, on the other, they make the streamlined and fast-paced base game quite unpredictable and potentially quite long. 

Harumph.

Like Dominion, Intrigue is very good and is an excellent expansion to the base set. The new cards provide more options, requiring a bit more thought with the effect of being a slower game than basic Dominion.  Intrigue is not as accessble to newbies as original Dominion, but its a very good step up for experienced players. This expansion is one for the sadists who enjoy some "take that" in their Dominion. More recently I've become convinced that Dominion suffers if there's a lot of downtime, especially if lots of players are learning the game. So, despite Intrigue allowing up to 6 players I would tend to shy away from any session with more than 4 - ideally a 6 player Intrigue game should be divided into two sessions of 3 people.

RATING: 8
The introduction of combo victory/action and victory/treasure cards *as well as* the potential to sabotage, swindle, etc. make this a much more complex competitive experience, and new card functions, except for the usual 2-3 blah cards, make fresh strategizing a fun necessity.

Nits: Bridge costs far too little for what it does; overloading on the new combination victory-and cards gets clunky; more buy multipliers and action multipliers would be helpful (but of course, since this can be integrated with original Dominion, you can swap in Festival, Village, Woodcutter, and other option-increasing cards). Masquerade is only fun with three or more players, probably ditto Torturer. Wishing Well is wimpy, Coppersmith is fantastic but only if you have an action multiplier like Shantytown... actually a lot of cards are fantastic but only with Shantytown. Our first thought was also that Pawn costs too little, but considering the power of the Saboteur, it's actually a great idea to make that cost 2.

Picks: Bridge is freaking awesome. Great art, spectacular economic monkey wrenching. Saboteur is the card that makes this game seriously angsty and competitive and fun; in the original, whoever got cards just kept them, and losers knew they were losing, but now ownership is not forever. (Small nit: Trashing as opposed to restoring to buy piles cuts the game off too quickly if you're obeying the if-3-action-cards-are-sold-out-game-over rule, which we don't, but still.) Trading Post gives you a lot of freedom to consolidate copper or switch out cards that aren't as useful later in the game, since you get a silver for trashing 2 cards and can even make money breaking curses. Conspirator is a significant improvement over your vanilla +2 treasure cards; variable function cards like Nobles and Pawns rock (though to maintain the spirit and risk of the game, we keep the rule that you have to declare what functions you're choosing at the time of play); Swindler seems like a great idea until you play it and someone turns up a Province, which might blow the whole game up in your face, which is beautiful.

Actual Problems: Card art in the first edition of Intrigue is definitely not as successful as in the original base game, and there is one actually offensive card: Harem, while technically useful as a combination 2 Victory / 2 Treasure card, has heavy-handedly ethnically stereotyped women lounging around in improbable clothing, and frankly, we know what a harem is, and this is actually a brothel - the treasure points make that clear. Other than that, there is the same dearth of women on the cards as in the original base game (and of course that one had one woman card too: the Witch). We are really hoping the second edition includes things like women on the Nobles card and a conversion of the "Harem" into some kind of gambling den.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a Dominion expansion it is over balaced, so mixing cards from both sets makes people always pick Intrigue cards (exept for the moat card). Because most of the dominion cars have a intrigue card that costs the same and does the same plus something else.
As a stand-alone game it's as fun as Dominion.

Endless replay value with all the expansions and I always enjoy playing it. It's really satisfying when you get your machine rolling and can play card after card.

More cards to chose from? Excellent! This set has combo cards, one that serve as both Victory Points and Money, or VP and Action, forcing you to decide if you want to pay a few copper more for a card worth less VP at the end, but will allow you more options now instead of it just taking up space in your hand.

RATING: 9
One of only three games in my collection that deserves the perfect '10'!

Expands Dominion, but is also completely playable on its own. Adds cards with multiple choices, but is basically "just" Dominion with a different set of cards. Though these cards might be slightly more interesting than the ones in the base set, they are also slightly more complex, so I still think it's best to start with the base set.
The 25 sets of cards does give a huge amount of replay value, and mixing in the 25 from Dominion makes the variation appear endless!
Attack cards are slightly harsher than the ones in Dominion, which might not be to every ones liking...

Increased the score: 9 --> 10!

So while my copy is technically not an expansion, I've still decided to drop the score from 10 --> 9...

RATING: 8
There is absolutely NO reason to play this with more than 4 people. Just split them into two games instead.

Intrigue has many more interesting cards than Dominion. However, I have a complaint about 3 specific cards:

1) Baron
I believe this card is broken. +1 buy is not all that impressive on its own, I understand. However, Baron + Estate is worth essentially 2 silvers, WITH A BUY ATTACHED. It is entirely too easy, with first round Baron and Silver purchases, to stack your deck with excessive amounts of money. This strategy sets up so quickly that most other decks can't keep up. This is ESPECIALLY true in 2 player games.

Update (3/25/13): Not broken, just incredibly solid.

2) Swindler
This card makes for excessively unfun games. An early Swindler essentially means that everyone else's copper quickly becomes curses, while you get an extra +2 credit. It quickly spirals into a "I'm going to swindle your Swindler" mess.

Update(3/25/13): Still hate this card. It's still unfun.

3) Saboteur
Essentially the same problem here as the Swindler, except it costs 5 and doesn't actually get you anything other than messing with your opponent's decks. Not quite as bad, but can ruin games, considering this card CAN hit provinces.

Update (3/25/13): Considering this card doesn't advance your position, I consider it a waste of a buy. A well-tuned deck can outrace a Saboteur pretty easily.


Favorite Card (3/25/13): Minion

Quick, Fun and Easy. Little variety in game play. I know you customize your deck, but each turn only has 2 parts: Action and Buy, then you done that turn and you usually have to start reshuffling. Possible better if you include Dominion decks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Dominion is a deck building game where all players start with a bit of money and a few victory points and use those cards to "purchase" additional cards for their deck from a common pool of cards.  I like it quite a bit, as it has a lot of the feel of Magic but is much more accessible to new players.  The intrigue set of cards is interesting, but unlike the original set there are no cards that allow for directly cursing another player.  It can still be done through cards like Masquerade or Swindler, but you have to get lucky rather than outright curse someone.  If I had a complaint it is that the game can be fairly solitary.  Even though you are playing with other people, there are often games where you are simply interacting with your own deck rather than with the other players at the table.  Part of the joy I get from playing tabletop games is that interaction with other players, and Dominion isn't very good at fostering that interaction.  That is a minor quibble, though, as it is an enjoyable strategy card game that is easy to pickup and fun to replay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This adds to the original 25 cards that comes with Dominion.  I found these cards upped the interaction between you and your opponents, but I am not so sure that is a great thing in this game.  At least I do not like how they implemented it.  In this game if your opponents decide to start attacking you, you wind up picking up a card that defends you against these attacks.  It just starts adding cards into both of your decks just for the sake of interaction.

I do not hate it, but I have since traded this expansion away.  I feel that Dominion is more fun without worrying about the added complexity/annoyance of interaction.  Plus, I like other Dominion expansion more and the amount that I play it, I do not need all of them.

There are still cards that stay unused, but as many as in the base game. Overall, the cards feel more interactive (between them), generate more combos and create more interaction between players.

Dominion (the base game) created the game, but this set seems to be an improvement in every sense.

New cards for Dominion?  Heck yeah!  The Torturer/Shanty Town combo is a little too broken though, which is why it comes in a point lower than the original base set.  Still an awesome game!

RATING: 8
(Finnish edition)
The cards are perhaps a bit too (text-)heavy if only played as a standalone game and not as an expansion for base game. There are more decisions to be made during playing and this slows the game down. It is still a good game but games aren't quite as (super) fast as in original set of cards. I really like new points+something else too -cards that give a bit more flexibility in ways of collecting points.

Playing with over 4 players should be done only if players are fast. There is too much downtime with 5 or 6 players otherwise (or maybe even then..).

[i]As an expansion[/i], it's a must-buy, and probably at its best when combined with the base game. About half of the cards are very clever. The rest vary from less interesting to weak. 

Adds a lot more decisions, interaction, and card text, which means that turns take a longer time now, and cards are more difficult to figure out. This is emphasized by the fact that the layout of the card texts is not very good, especially on the 'choose one' cards. Which is even more strange considering that they have managed to do it correctly on the Ironworks and Tribute cards anyway. While the original [gameid=36218] is very accessible and plays quickly even with beginners and non-gamers, I'll probably try to avoid playing this expansion with those groups or slow players. 

[i]As a complete game[/i], it's not as elegant as the original [gameid=36218].

Dominion's evil twin - all that applies for Dominion applies here as well, but with more nastiness, stronger cards, wilder swings in enjoyment over several rounds and less control of what's going on (i.e. a steeper learning curve). It's still outstanding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Meh...

Lacks the tightness of the original Dominion and the impact cards which could transform a deck (Chapel and Remodel, notably). While there are a couple of great cards, there are also too many almost entirely pointless ones as well (Scout, Tribute, Wishing Well). Disappointing production values and the insistence on big-boxing a deck of cards are doing nothing but hurting the gamer. I seem to be in a minority in finding Intrigue to be a distinct step down from the original.

Intrigue is all about choices. It's like the base game but it seems like each card has multiple routes which really adds to the decision making.

Intrigue adds some "mean" cards. If your a more experienced gamer & want to try out Dominion, you could probably skip the base pack for this first.

The new cards feel like they take the game in a new direction even though the game play feels identical. A neat trick. It's still all about building the deck, no change there. But players have more choice about introducing randomness (ie risk/reward payoffs). The downside, which is why I rate it considerably lower, is the higher level of interaction, and ways to mess with other peoples' decks, which causes a much longer game for less fun - a double whammy.

If you don't think the base Dominion set provides enough conflict, this is the expansion for you.  Intrigue includes more attacks, more ways to mess with your opponents, and more ways to interact.  For some, this will be a distinct downer since the conflict "feels" wrong for a game in this genre.  For others, it's a nice change of pace.

I've found that I don't like mixing more than two of the Dominion sets, though.  Throw three together and instead of "flavor" you get "a mess."  But the ability to mix & match provides lots and lots of replay capacity in a relatively short, easy to learn game with great depth.

A must in terms of adding great new cards and increasing the variety of ways to play and develop a game, and a must for allowing the game to play up to 6 people in one group. I do not see two separate games of dominion being played with friends, it seems to go against the 'fun' of a boardgame, which is group interaction.
The game has some great cards, including everyone's favourite card, Harem! Also, love the additional action/victory cards to create more than one strategy for winning the game. It really is a must have box set.

It's ok. Definitely adds more to the interactive gameplay than the original, even though there seems to be quite heavy cards now, and if you don't use the pre-selected decks you might get totally weird and unplayable combinations...

Also I've ran into a certain pattern while playing - from 10 action decks on the table, more than 3 are usually not even touched. Makes you wonder if there are the few really usable cards and rest are just the filling or the frosting on the cake...

Still I wonder the card design - of course now it's impossible to change anything since they have to be compatible backwards, but what is the idea of the backside being symmetric, but the fronts still need to be right way to be able to read the texts? One of the biggest and annoying design flaws I think in a game where you need to shuffle cards all the time, and spend another minute of turning the cards correctly in your hand...

Good, but not great. Still suggest Evolution Earth: Cataclysm for a different approach of similar gamestyle. Much, much more deeper and more tied to the theme also...

I'm addicted to this one as well. Played lots of games on Board Game Arena, and still play a lot on Androminion. I haven't played live that much lately, but will usually never turn down a game of this.(copied from the original entry)

RATING: 7
I really like the alt-VP cards in Intrigue, but don't care a whole lot about the rest of the set.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't have a lot going for it in comparison to the base set; it's just a little too vanilla.  That said, I never mind mixing it in with other sets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The name says it all. Dominion: Intrigue provides a new set of Kingdom cards to Dominion that are really intriguing, giving choices a lot of the time. Your opponent plays a Torturer, do you discard two cards from your hand, or take a -1 point Curse card? 

It's a great twist on the game.

March 2010: Mixed feelings on this expansion. I dislike Swindler and Saboteur most of all because it's strategy-breaking. Cards like Minion, Upgrade, and Bridge are great because they encourage some creativity. Overall, a weaker set of cards than the base. Scoring 7.2 here seems appropriate.

RATING: 7.1
Bought this one so I could play with up to eight. Too bad they recommend two separate games with more than six and I could have played with six using the base game and the blank cards to add a few more Provinces. I wish someone would have told me that's all this does. You loose half a point for that one, Rio Grande! More like Not So Grande!   

But good mix of new cards that does and add some new options. Improves Dominion, but not worth the price tag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Other than Alchemy (which I will not buy) this is my least favorite of the Dominion expansions.  There are some fun cards, but the focus on attacking other players and the vanilla flavor of a lot of the other cards just isn't very exciting to me.  It also includes the only card I refuse to play with in the game (Saboteur) and the card with arguably the worst artwork (Harem).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rating for the expansion should be read in conjunction with the rating for the base game i.e. if we're playing Dominion, then the expansion rating indicates how likely I am to suggest using the cards from it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This set is a mix of good and bad.  Obviously the Saboteur is a horrible, horrible card that just causes everyone to have an awful game experience.  Not a big fan of the Swindler either.  On the other hand, I did like the "combo" cards that allowed you to score points while buying an action or treasure card.  The option to play with more players seems nice, but in reality it just adds to downtime unnecessarily.  On the whole, I'd rate this expansion as a slight negative over the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like the Dominion base game, this has an excellent gameplay and is very easy for first-time players to pick up. Very replayable due to the different selections of available cards, most of which are quite balanced (I've seen the vast majority of the cards used successfully in different strategies). More of a '2nd release' than an expansion, Intrigue comes with the Treasure and Victory cards allowing it to be played independently from the original. Compared with Dominion, there are fewer cards that give you lots of actions and buys, meaning the gameplay can be slightly 'cagier' - whether this is a good or bad thing depends on what you like!

Adds some variety to a game that can get repetitive without an infusion of new cards.  Not sure what that says about the game...

I do however enjoy this base set more than the base set of Dominion. Granted I've only put about 10 plays into this, but I really enjoy this one a lot more.

As an expansion, I would rate it lower; it gets a higher grade because it's also stand-alone. It's very good to teach the game, as well, but among core gamers. The base game should be preferred as an introductory game to more casual gamers.

Dominion took a path to a more complex and deeper game with Intrigue. You have choices on cards, hybrid cards and more interesting attack cards. Thus the strategies are not that straigt forward anymore. Average game length is probably a bit longer than with base Dominion alone, but I don´t mind it when I get a more interesting game to play.

Opposed to some other fellow gamers opininons I think that Dominion is very dynamic and variable. It is not that easy to figure out what combination works better than others from the available 10 cards each game. Also playing with different people means games will have different flow and strategies used. Replay value is extremely high.

update: after 86 plays, this game has officialy gone gold for me. I just can´t get enough of this. Rating 9 -> 10

The decks aren't even close to reaching the standard of the basegame on their own. There are some really good decks here though and in combination with the original decks they make the whole even better. Some special features are a little bit confusing, but that seems to be a problem with the translation into Finnish.
As a game on its' own it's maybe a [b]7[/b] but if you use the decks with the original ones then it's a solid [b]9[/b], borderline [b]10[/b]!

More great cards to choose from for the Dominion set.  It definitely spices the game up to have some Intrigue cards in the selection.  Apparently it can also be played as a stand-alone.  We haven't tried that yet, but I'm inclined to think it wouldn't work quite as well.  The Intrigue cards are all about choices or interactions with other players (eg. 'choose this, this, or that', or 'each player chooses one card from their hand and passes it to the left') and I think the game benefits from having at least some simpler cards in the set of 10 action cards.  Otherwise, the action might get a bit ponderous.

RATING: 6
Maybe I'm not using this expansion right, but it seemed to slow down the base game quite a bit. By that I mean that the attacks slowed engine building and the decreased number of "extra action" cards tended to make the turns simpler and less interesting. I think some of the cards would be very interesting, but as a spice. Supposedly this is a playable game (ie., playable without owning the base game) but a bit slower and meaner than base Dominion. I like the modified green cards which give a blend of points and powers. It's nice to be able to have a points card that isn't complete deadweight in terms of play, but I would call this an expansion to be used sparingly to add to the base game, rather than calling it a playable alternate base game. It is decidedly not in the same league as the original base game when used alone.

This is a great addition to the Dominion family. I would not suggest Intrigue before the base Dominion game - it would ruin your Dominion experience. Intrigue is more of an evolution of the standard Dominion game, making it a little more complex with choices that produce secondary effects. And since you can later combine the two games, you might as well buy and play Dominion and if you like the gameplay expand it with Intrigue. Fun deck building game.

I love the flexibility given by the kingdom cards in this expansion.  The idea that the player can choose which action to take with a given card, or that cards provide a variety of bonuses has made for some much more interesting decision making, especially at the six treasure level.  I think it also makes you feel like you're a little more in control of your turn, rather than just doing what your cards have laid out for you.  Very good expansion.

One of the things I disliked about Dominion was that a turn more or less played itself; the only real decision to make was what to buy at the end of the turn. This expansion changes that, which I like. It does make the gameplay a bit more difficult to track, though.

Adds to the base game: :star::star::halfstar::nostar:

Some cards I like, some I love, and some I could do without. I like that there's more decision-making, while keeping the complexity low, but overall the focus seems to shift from building combos to disrupting your opponents. Though that does give more variance, I'd rather play lots of same-y, but fun games, than games that are sometimes fun and sometimes don't go anywhere.

Takes the basic Dominion efficiency engine, and adds a modicum of interaction cards to mess with the opponents. 
At least with the cards that offered both victory points and efficiency actions, and mess with player events there were somethings to make a decision.

RATING: 9.5
After only 1 game, I think I like the expansion more than the base game due to the more complex cards.  New qualities such as multiple card types (as in Harem) and flexible cards (such as Pawn) make this set appear to be more varied in strategies for victory.  As I play more, I hope this continues to be the case and that it blends well with the base set when mixed.

I haven't played the base game yet, so I can't compare this to the original, but I have played this enough to evaluate the system.  I like it, but I'm not in love with it.  It's a neat system that makes a game of deckbuilding but it lacks so much in interaction I find myself wandering between turns.  What few cards there are that influence player interaction are either not powerful enough for me to consider buying or are so danged un-fun that I'd rather not play with them at all.  The quickness leads to many rapid, repeat sessions, which is fun, but overall, I'm just not enamoured with the game yet.  Maybe more is to come, and I hope so, because I really enjoy the CCG-like feel of deckbuilding and playing, without the expense!

Below are my comments on Dominion.  Intrigue is just more of the same.  If you love Dominion, you'll probably love the added variety in Intrigue.

[q="rayito2702"]This is an okay game. Players start out with a set deck of cards. On a turn, players play what cards they can and discard the rest. Cards provide points, money and other types of powers. Throughout the game players use their existing cards to acquire new ones. If properly chosen the new cards will combine to produce additional fun combinations of card play and more points.

Game play is simple to the point of being simplistic. It's the card combos that add what spice there is to the game. There's a few "screw your neighbor" cards, but mostly players will be racing to get the desirable cards into their deck as fast as possible.

Basically this is your standard Efficiency Engine game built around a novel deck building mechanism. For me, a novel mechanism does not a good game make. On one hand the game is light and fluffy and takes hardly any time at all to play. On the other it strives for complexity in the card combos. It goes by too fast to enjoy what complexity there is, while being too fiddly and full of pieces to justify the quick playing time. It's sort of like listening to Beethoven's fifth sped up to twice the normal speed.

Maybe if I played it enough so that I could process the card combos and endless shuffling without thinking the game would become more interesting. But its currently not interesting enough to devote that kind of time to.

It desperately needs card protectors since some cards will get worn out much faster than others. The graphic design of the cards leave much to be desired. The card backs are atrocious and the art, while not bad, is just generic fantasy and I'm sick of generic fantasy.[/q]

Great game, however I feel it doesn't really change the game play mechanics that much, it just adds more cards to the base set.

Still there is a tonne of replay values but if I lost this game it wouldn't be the end of the world.

The base game was flawed in that a strategy existed that was, for the most part, insurmountable and obsoleted a number of the kingdom cards.  This expansion addresses that issue while innovating the card types and expanding functionality.  Intrigue is a step in the right direction and adds a slew of new cards to an already deeply customizable game.

Dominion: Intrigue is great because it makes a good game even better.  The cards give players many more interesting options and this game increases player interaction.  So far I'm a big fan of the Masquerade card for player interaction because it isn't necessarily harmful, it's just interesting.  Intrigue definitely makes Dominion into more of a gamers game without losing the approachability that makes Dominion so great.

generally feels more powerful than the original, with more complex and/or damaging cards to work with. Sometimes this makes for a fun experience.

RATING: 7
My brother said this was like a collectible card game without the 'collectible' part.  With so many 'expansions' out I'm beginning to doubt this.

However, this is a fun game with a good amount of of strategy and re-playability.  There's some luck involved, but when you are the one building your own deck, it is somewhat your own fault if you draw a bad hand.  If you weren't constantly shuffling the cards I think I'd like it more.

This expansion provides some very good additional Kingdom cards to add even more interesting combinations.

RATING: 8
Only played a handfull of games of this expansion so far, but I'm really impressed. More choices to be made in gameplay, some cool interactions, and the sheer novelty of another two dozen action cards. My impression is that this is more of an advanced set of cards than the first. More choices does slow the game down a bit, especially with unfamiliar cards!

Has some extra complexity and truly has cards that I would describe as intriguing.  There seems to be quite a few good card combo in this set.  I like the multi-purpose victory cards which is something that is lacking in other sets that I really enjoy.  As of yet more complex then the original but not as much as seaside.  Probably along the lines of Prosperity. It'll be interesting to see how this set mixes with others.  Overall as with Dominion just a great game.

RATING: 7.9
Our first play took over 2 hours.  Really.  But the next two went fast, and I think we're addicted to this game.  We seem to be torn between replaying the same set of cards to 'figure them out', and trying new combos.  Brilliant.

*update*  One of the only games my husband has ever shown overt enthusiasm for (the other being Pandemic).  I have no trouble getting him to play a game or two a night- HOORAY!  Can't wait to collect a few more expansions.

**update**  Upped this to a '9'. With the addition of Seaside and Alchemy, this has become the perfect game for the hubby and I.  Quick, different every time, loads of fun (I ♥ the Pirate Ship)- wonderful. 

Also, I love the iPod randomizer app (I prefer 'Dominion Kingdom Deck' for the ability to ban cards and set other preferences) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An interesting set of cards, like:
Bridge (reducing costs of cards to buy is great, the combo with multiple throne rooms or king's courts can be incredible!)
Duke (all of a sudden going for duchies can be profitable!)
Ironworks (gain a card costing 4 can be powerful if you draw a victory/action card like great hall or island. A very quick way to run out of 3 stacks!)
Nobles (one of my favourites. Gives you vp, and then either extra cards or extra actions, making it always useful!)
Saboteur (the most frustrating dominion card ever, especially when someone sabotages your colonies or provinces)
Steward (great variability, +2 cards, +2 coins or 2 trashes, works great with nobles in this set too)
Torturer (frustrating, do you discard or take a curse. How about getting this 3 times in a row? aargh!)
Upgrade (an awesome (free, as it is +1 actions +1 card) way to get rid of estates in exchange for silvers!)

And also minion, mining village and masquerade are awesome! Great set!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Intrigue is just as good as the original Dominion, with or without it.  The card mechanics available are different than those in the main set, but they're all fairly well balanced.

Sometimes the "choose" cards can slow things down somewhat, but it's not that bad overall.  Leave them out when you have distractions or new players and no problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The first Dominion expansion does contain a small number of highly situational or even borderline-useless cards (chiefly Scout, but I think Coppersmith, at least, usually falls in this category), but it is still a must-have for all Dominion fans. Many powerful and interesting cards (Minion especially), and also cheap and flexible cards (Steward, and especially Pawn). Also - and this will be a downside for many, not least my wife, who hates this expansion - some of the cruelest attacks in the game (Swindler, Torturer, Saboteur). There is nothing especially complicated here, and Intrigue is undoubtedly more interesting than the base set when considered as standalone games, but I would still recommend new players start with the base set, as many of the Intrigue cards require some experience with the game to know what to do with quickly or effectively.

(5/15/13) - [8] - I am a huge fan of the original Dominion, so naturally I very much enjoy Dominion: Intrigue. The cards for Intrigue are a bit more sophisticated, but for some reason don't seem to interact together quite as well as the base set does. It is worth noting that some of Intrigue's card artwork is downright atrocious.

Added much-needed diversity to Dominion, but I personally find a lot of the cards in Intrigue shift time away from the part I find most satisfying, which is the deck building part. There's a lot more going on with tactical card play with all of the options available. The attack cards are very nasty and can totally wreak havoc on whatever you're trying to build, forcing you to adapt. They can also force the game to end with the three-stacks-gone rule, which makes the game much longer.

It's a very interesting addition to Dominion, but games with a lot of Intrigue cards tend to run long for my tastes and drag out. When mixed with the base set, though, there's not as much chaos. The versatility of some of the Intrigue cards comes out instead of being unnecessary complexity. I much prefer the mixed version.

Lehet, hogy csak azért kerül túl magasra a mérce, mert az alapjátéknál mindenki jobbnak mondta. Szerintem nem az. Gyakorlatilag nagyjából ugyanazt a szintet hozza, de extra csavart nem tudott belerakni. Azt sem érzem, hogy lényegesen jobban befolyással tudnánk lenni a másik játékára.
Egyedül a kombinált kártyák azok, amelyek igazán jók benne. Egyszerűen többet vártam...
Talán több játékossal, vagy a különböző dobozokat vegyítve jobban működhet. Azt még majd ki kell, hogy próbáljam, hogy nyilatkozni tudjak róla.

I have to say--they took a great thing and made it indisputably and impossibly better.  All of the cards in this game seem more powerful--but it's not clear if that's because it's new or because they actually are.  In any event, Intrigue only games, or mixing and matching with the base game, there is no way to go wrong (and we'll still be playing classic as well).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This makes the rather bland original much more interesting. I think the base game has to be viewed as a kind of introductory "family" version of the game; really, you can only enjoy it with this (and perhaps the later) expansion(s).

Dominion for the Ameritrash folks. Nastier attacks. More randomness. Bring it on.

I luuurve Secret Chamber, even though most strategy players don't like this card. At the beginning of the game, you use it to buy a 4-gold card, even though the rest of your hand has coppers and estates. In the middle of the game, you wave it around even though it doesn't stop an attack, then set up your hand for the next draw. It's best to have a strong hand each turn, but SC at least can convert two middling hands into a weak hand this turn (which gets attacked) and a strong hand next. Since it affects the top card of your deck, you also get to gloat when someone attacks the top card of your deck -- keep their hands off your Gold and show them an Estate! If attacked, you can even put the SC back on top of your deck for next turn, if you happen to know what cards are left in your deck!

Anyway, for OP:
* Euro: Dominion, Prosperity, Seaside.
* Ameritrash: Intrigue, Hinterlands, Guilds and Cornucopia, Adventure

Dominion rocked, but I could see where after about 100 games or so it would start to wear thin.  Enter Intrique, now I can see myself wanting to play this game 300 times easy.

I found this expansion a little weird. On one hand, you have really powerful cards that are game changers. On the other hand, some cards feel out of place and biazarre.

RATING: 6
There was obviously some effort put in to address some of the shortfallings of the previous editions. The addition of multiple win conditions (Duke/Duchies) as well as the utility victory cards is nice. The addition of cards that allow multiple different actions is good too as it allows for more choice for card play.

However, the improvements are not major enough and it still feels like most of your important decisions are made in the first minute as you decide on how to construct your deck.When playing your cards there is almost always no tough decision.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After a number of plays, this brings Dominion into the realm of "terrific" for me. If the base game was too vanilla for you, problem solved. If the cards seemed too similar, problem solved. This is one of the best expansions ever released, and one that is necessary for any fan of the base game.

The highest compliment that can be paid is that it changes the feel of the game without adding any rules weight at all. The game feels a little more aggressive (though interaction still is pretty low) and just a bit more thematic (though it's still very abstract), but it's still Dominion, just taken in a different direction.

*edit* This is the better base set for Dominion, but it has suffered the same fate of just sitting on the shelf. It has value, but I have other deckbuilders that I like more.

I played this a year after it came out and didn't really give it a chance. I traded for this after playing and liking the ios version of Acenscion. Because of Acenscion I thought I would give deck building another chance. I have already played about 50 games of Dominion in about 3 weeks. It is my favorite game. It plays quick, changing card setups introduces new strategies, and my wife loves it too!

Better than dominion, but some of the cards still feel a bit 'samey' to me. 

There are some nice powers, but I generally find going for a less-interesting, more predictable deck still triumphs.

Some good cards but some awful ones as well (Minion, for example, is a real game-spoiler). Not as solid as the base set, and terrible, terrible art. (Duke, Harem, Minion, Shanty Town, Scout...) In fact, the main reason why I haven't bought this game is because I can't bring myself to pay for such ugly cards. 

I really hope that they release a revised edition of Dominion in the future with better illustrations! Why not have a competition to find art for the cards? The game is so popular that I am sure people would be queueing up to illustrate it! This would save them from having to pay artists to phone-in some of these awful pictures, and would also avoid the need to use knock-off recycled art from other games, like they have evidently done for City (in Prosperity) and Upgrade (in Intrigue). Just a thought!

Could this be one of the few expansions that actually improves upon a good base game?  Normally, great games should be left alone, but this expansion adds "dual land" cards and a lot more interaction, especially deck killing mecahnisms and ways to trash your owen deck for better cards.  A must have, if you can afford the idea it is a full game in and of itself.

I have mixed feelings about this expansion(/standalone alternative).  I love the hybrid cards and some of the new action cards, but some are a bit meh and we've also had some slow games with the new attack cards which made it drag on longer than we liked.

I sold my copy, but only because the friends we usually play Dominion with have it as well and theirs is kitted out with much better sleeves, so I didn't really need my own copy any more.  Kept the base game to play with my wife and anyone else we introduce the game to.

An improvement over the base game, because the more versatile cards actually provide some decisions for card play, which the base game sorely lacked (the decisions are rather trivial, however). The trade-off is longer games.

Still doesn't change the boring nature of the game (picking a strategy at the start and running it through with minimal alterations).

The rating I have given this is really an average rating.  When played alone, this game is a six -- and a really low six at that.  As a standalone, this really seems to take a game I really like and make it a whole lot less fun.  It seems as though there really is too much going on.  All in all, it just doesn't seem to work on its own.

However, Intrigue really shines as an expansion.  When mixing the cards into the base game, this is a solid 8 for me.  While I would still be willing to play Dominion without the Intrigue cards included, I don't really see that as likely happening.  The cards seem to mesh well with the base set, making things more interesting, giving more interesting decisions and strategies.    [08/09/2009] [7]
-------------------------------
My estimation of Intrigue has really fallen off since the release of Seaside.  I still think this works only when mixed and not by itself.  In that sense, I think they picked the wrong subset as the stand-alone set.  At this point, my rating is based on a 5 for Standalone status and 7 for Expansion status.  while it could go lower in both, giving an overall lower score, it is much more likely to go lower in the standalone category.  I already suspect that the 5 I am allowing is way to generous.  [11/12/2009]

Everything good I have to say about Dominion still holds true, with the exception that I think Intrigue is a weaker stand alone set than the base set. It is best when mixed with the base and or other sets. 

Some attack cards in this expansion are considerably "meaner" than the base game, and more choices on some cards will adds a little length to the play time. 

Most recent plays 8-14-10 with Garrett.

Lots of fun new kooky cards (although, I'm not a fan of one card in particular).  Really, this is just more great Dominion crack.  There is no reason not to get this if you want to switch stuff up a bit.  The nice thing is that this will come with the money and VP cards again, so people can start here, or for people like me that would like to expand it to more players -- this will allow for 5 or 6 or will allow two groups to play this simultaneously.

The only reason that I don't give this a 10 is that there are two cards that I don't really enjoy playing with. 

First, The Saboteur is just intolerable.  It stretches the game out to no rewarding end.  If there is no defensive card available it is even worse.  Blech.  Every time someone plays the card you essentially lose one turn of builds.  This gets old really fast.

The second, The Minion, while not a terrible offender, it just irritating when people keep having to discard their whole hand.  You don't even want to look at your hand until it is your turn.  So annoying.

Awesome expansion for an awesome game.  Not surprisingly, the expansion (as with most games) brings new concepts to the game. 

Plus, the expansion can also be used as a stand alone game (you don't need the default Dominion game to use it).

Although there are the same number of attack cards in this set as the base set, it just seems, well, nastier, as a standalone.  In combination, if you choose more attack cards it is EXTRA nasty.

Lots of nasty cards, but most of them are the same, boring "take that" sort of thing, never allowing any sophisticated interaction. If you enjoy games where nobody can accomplish anything, the winner is the only one with a positive score, and everything depends on who gets their nasty cards in the right draws, you'll love it. I give it a couple of points because there are some interesting cards in the set, as well.

Dominion, but with convoluted card conditions.  Take an action, or a gold, or a card, or a this, or a that, if a this, if a that.  Blech.  How do people like this?

Edit 12/21/20012:  I fail to see the interest in Dominion or any of its ilk. 

Anti-social? Check.
No theme? Check.
Repetitive shuffling? Check.
Repetitive game play? Check.

Why bother?  Ugh.  Read a book instead.  Or, y'know, play a better game.

I could tell it would be a 10 just by reading the cards.  It sounded so good I needed to take a cold shower.  The only other similar experience I've ever had was when I first read the rules to Ticket To Ride. After playing it, my instincts were confirmed.  Everything is so well thought out-you can see the care that went into developing the game.  The action cards, rulebook, artwork, even the little insert to help with storing the cards.  Everything is excellent. What a GREAT game! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like to call this "Base Set #2".  Like the base Dominion set this includes a bunch of standard utility cards that would be good in any Kingdom setup.  Nothing fancy but they work great and can be building blocks to great combos and interesting plays when combined with some of the other more inventive cards in future sets.

The most interesting addition in this set were the dual victory - action/treasure cards that allowed you to collect victory points and still have a functional card when you drew it into your hand.  Also, just the fact that this adds 25 new Kingdom cards AND an additional set of basic treasures/victory cards/curses makes this a hit.  New cards (as long as they work in the context of the  game) are always a boon for deck-builders to keep them fresh and giving players the resources to play two games or up to a 6-player single game makes this a must-buy for any Dominion fan.

I haven't played Dominion enough to really judge how good the new cards in this expansion are but believe that a wider range of choices of cards is usually a good thing, higher replay-ability. 
For adding base cards to allow up to 6 players, I have not much love (therefor the lower rating). This many players seem to lengthen the game unnecessarily and adding too much down time til the next turn. Dominion has a too solitary streak to work well with more, I prefer a max. of 4 players (2 or 3 is the best choice though).

More of the same. Seems to be following the same trajectory as MTG in alternate uses of cards, bigger combos, etc... However, there is little interaction.  Maybe i'm missing something but it appears to be an exercise in mainly solitaire play and card shuffling. Mildly amusing as you see how the new cards work but it feels lke the antithesis of interactive gaming.

My initial view has changed - the games great, ok not much interaction but the combos and interactions are elegant and clever and this is perfect way to wile away 45 minutes before playing a longer game

Adds some interesting cards to the base game.  Still a great filler, still highly overrated.  This being in the top ten (which it most likely will be soon) as well as the base game is just mind-boggling to me, while they are good games, they just aren't top ten material.

Ok, this goes over well with just about anyone that we play it with. So easy to pick up and get playing.

I enjoy this sort of thinking, but I'm a little worried about the lack of theme. It has very little to do with the actual game. But I have an idea for a theme that would integrate all parts in a reasonable way...

63 plays + quite many on bsw. I don't get tired of this. Upping a half point.

Lack of feeling of accomplishment means that it can't ever be more than a 7.

RATING: 10
Rating is the same as for the base game. Of course, if you like Dominion, you'll like this. If you don't like it, Intrigue will probably not change it.

I've only played it as a standalone as yet. Once I know the cards well enough (say, after 20-30 plays), I'll mix it with the base game.

On Intrigue itself: the cards are (much) more complex, so this is not recommended if you haven't played the base game. I like how the cards allow for different strategies and ways to counter other ones. Especially Chapel doesn't look so powerful anymore.

RATING: 7.5
This game is... well... intriguing.  But I'll get the negatives out of the way before I jump into the positive aspects.  The main reason I will not purchase this game/expansion is that they released it in a big box, full game format instead of a smaller, cheaper set of expansion cards.  I can see why they would want to cater to those who wished to make "Dominion" playable with more than 4 players (and while I haven't tried it, I can see how that might work out fairly well since downtime is so minimal in this game), but I'd rather they had released the extra money and VP cards as a separate expansion too.  Also, the light blue and red colour scheme is just as atrocious as the original game, and the artwork rides the same fine line between kind of neat and fairly cheesy.  However, to focus on more positive things, it's always nice to increase the number of different card options, particularly when several of those cards involve interaction with other players.  The coolest thing about the new cards are the ones that have combined action/VP effects, such as the "Harem" card (now THAT is some pretty awful artwork...).  Overall, I find that the negatives balance out the positives to maintain a rating that's identical to the original game - it's still a very enjoyable gaming experience.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

A fun addition to the system; attack cards like Masquerade, Saboteur and Torturer make it more appealing to fans of direct interaction.

[RGG 2009 edition]  Why can't the publishers take this chance to revise the dumb victory point cards and gold cards?  Nonetheless, the dual purpose cards and multiple-choice cards are interesting.

A few plays of Intrigue (without Dominion). The same, yet quite different. The first 2 suggested card sets revealed a range of new actions which lured us away from the familiar routine to explore new approaches.

Intrigue takes the game play of Dominion and adds a cut throat element to the game by introducing a host of new attack cards. This increases the tensions, and forces you to decide between an all out attack yourself or building things slowly and relying on defense cards.

I must say that, after first plays, I'm a rather disappointed. It's right that the new cards create totally new strategies and the ways how to lead the game. I like the concept of cards when you can choose some options (e.g. Steward, Ironworks, Courtyard). I like the concept of 'victory + something' cards (Nobles, Harem, Great Hall) and their interaction with others. With Intrigue, you have more options to control the randomness of the game. But, I still feel that it is the same old game that I have played so many times... Maybe I shouldn't buy expansions at all.

Number of plays: 15 or more.

As good as the base game - but the choices on the action cards might be a bit too much for a first game. I suggest to introduce new players to this game with the base set, and later use Intrigue as well.

Exactly suffers from the same problems as Dominion.  It does have a little bit more interaction than regular Dominion, but it's still no fun to play it, and your actions are dictated by the cards you draw, rather than actual decision making.

Deck building for the sake of deck building. Wheres the purpose? Why do I care? Was pretty fun the first couple times but then went downhill real fast for me. A completely hollow and unfufilling experience. Pick a strategy and play it out over many turns. You may as well tell people what your strategy is going to be before playing and then just calculate out who would win.

Intrigue is a standalone Dominion expansion, meaning it includes the gold/victory point cards.  

This set I have found mixes very nicely with other sets, especially dark ages.  The highlight of this set is a variety of victory point/action cards, as well as ways to gain victory points without putting them in your deck.  

This gets a 9 because again, I think other expansions need to be brought along with this set to get the best Dominion has to offer, but this set will certainly stand strong on its own.

This game is great since you can play it with Dominion, or as it's own new game. It has the same amount of cards as the original, but probably more unique. The uniqueness means I would prefer to play it as a support deck (meaning using 6-7 action cards from the original, and 3-4 from the new) but it's still awesome as it's own game.

Intrigue workds pretty well as a standalone game or as an expansion, but I'm not too fond of all the cards, they tend to slow the game down a bit too much sometimes. (Feb 27 10)

It feels like this expansion contains a power creep from the base-game (with Masquerade, Torturer, Bridge, Conspirator, Minion, Steward etc.) What keeps this game fresh though is the level of decision making that is required to succeed which gives it a feel similar to the base game. Highly recommended (especially if you can obtain the non-US copy of it)

Pros: Consistant with the base set.
Combo Victory cards.
Added base cards.

Cons: Some card unnecessarily evil.
Artwork bad.
Cardstock thin.

Conclusion: Dominion: Intrigue is a fine enough expansion to Dominion, but I don't like to play it alone without the base game.  Cards I don't care for include Swindler, Sabatour, and Torturer.  We usually do a random setup and cringe when these cards appear.  I do like the nicer 2 cost cards like Pawn and Courtyard.  I'm glad I have it and it works well with the base and Seaside sets.

The victory cards Duke, Great Hall, Harem and Nobles are the real innovation of this set, although there are some interesting new kingdom cards.

If used sparingly to spice up the base game, Dominion: Intrigue can be effective.  But in general terms, it add complexity without enhancing gameplay.  If played standalone, each card takes so long to resolve that Dominion: Intrigue completely stalls out. Try Seaside instead.

Quick and fun game, cannot really see the difference to Dominion - but it adds more cards so it is more variety. Of course, multi player solitaire with just a few interactive cards.

The Dominion sets are good alone, but should be played together to get the interesting combinations.

I like that this one adds a bit more player interaction.

Update: Actually, the interaction cards tend to just slow the game down.  I prefer the non-attack cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Even more great ideas for an already great game. Only letdown is the different quality in the artwork. Some illustrators came up with artworks that build up towards a great mood creating an own Dominion universe/ that really build up atmosphere. And then there's other artworks that just don't. Don't at all! It seems as if some random guy from the streets was asked "Hey, do you have five minutes? could you draw us a card for a game system that and so on and so on" Makes you rather want to choose those cards with great artwork and leave out the rest. Too bad that for example the Shanty town is very effective in some combinations. 
And just by looking at the artwork from the freshly unwrapped Seaside, it is the same there :-( 


[-]I don't get why this has no entry of its own in the game ranking. It's a stand-alone game. With games in the database that are just reimplementations, new editions of old games or deluxe editions having their own entry, I don't see why this game shouldn't.[/-]

Really nice expansion.  It's especially great that it's a full standalone game too.  We've found Dominion starts to get too slow if you have more than 3 players, so it's nice to have this as a second set, so we can just split up into groups of 2 or 3 players, rather than try to play with 4 or more.  The Intrigue cards help mix things up a lot, yet compliment the base game really well.

Expands the play options of Dominion, including the addition of much more tactical hand play (i.e. "Should I use this card for X or Y?").

RATING: 7
It is certainly a meaner and entirely more interactive version of an addictive (though stuffy themed) game.  

Why someone can't come up with a design like this with a theme that might be even slightly interesting to a common non-gamer is beyond me.  It has tremendous breakthrough potential to be an incredible and credible hit.  But it's silly medieval trappings are just not palatable to most outside of hobby gaming.

All of that said, I enjoy the game immensely.  

UPDATE:  The last couple of games, I have played with a random set up, which I never got around to doing with the original Dominion.  It really opened my eyes to the vast variability of the game--just tons of ways to play the game.  Although I still think the theme is ridiculously high-brow, the system is fantastic.

The worst of the Dominion line that I have played. Felt like these cards were those they had omitted from the original, and then later used for this.

The price of this game (which really is an expansion rather than a complete new game) is ridiculous (e.g., Agricola is cheaper), but it does make Dominion a much more intriguing game: The choices you have to make during the game are more complex and therefore a lot more interesting than they used to be in the previous base game.

This expansion has really revived my enjoyment of Dominion.  While I loved the base game by itself, it had grown a bit stale as the cards and their interactions became too familiar.  Intrigue really shakes things up.  Yes, it adds a lot more chaos, but it also makes it more interactive, removing some of the "multiplayer solitaire" feeling of the base game alone.  And I, at least, find it fun trying to manage through the growing chaos, as the other players try to mess with your perfect deck by buying Swindlers, Saboteurs, Masquerades, Torturers, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great game with very nice artwork. I have a few expansions for it of which I like prosperity the best. Its a bit of a hassle to mix the different expansions in with the base game.

I don't think it deserves the praise it gets though.

RATING: 4
I tried Intrigue seven times to make sure it wasn't going to breath the new life into Dominion that I had been hoping for. Clearly Intrigue and Seaside have done just that for countless people, but the new cards are just variations on what we've already seen, albeit more complex and with more decisions to be made after having purchased them, but still more of the same as far as I can tell. I'm happy with the almost 150 plays I got out of Dominion and think it's time for me to hang up my hat and move on.

Essentially a stand alone expansion of Dominion.  Fans of the original will love the additional cards.  

While Intrigue doesn't add any mind-boggling content, the new cards are fun and add quite a bit of choice for players.  Several of the cards feature "choose this or this" gameplay, which creates many options while playing.

A couple of the cards are pretty hefty game-changers... the Saboteur is pretty brutal, particularly in games or 3 or 4. 

All in all, a rewarding and solid expansion for fans of the original.

Ideal first upgrade for Dominion - although Dominion is not a complicated game unlike Hinterlands, Cornucopia and Seaside these cards are pretty straight forward. I think the interaction level raises a notch due to the inclusion of several attack action cards; Saboteur is not a favourite in our group! Not sure why it was released as a standalone version - made it a more expensive purchase than a regular large expansion.

The expansions bring new concepts and new materials to play with (including some small but really heavy high-quality metal coins and tokens in some of them).

RATING: 7.5
Having played only the base game, this game will feel like ice unexpectedly poured down your shirt. Intrigue hurts. Prepare to adjust your strategy. This can get nasty. Still - it's Dominion, so it rawks!

These cards aren't as fun as the original set, IMO. But they give you moar Dominion!

(NOTE: All plays are tracked on my Dominion plays.)

UPDATE: I like a lot of the cards from this set now. There are several great ones.

Good expansion for Dominion. New card are not too complex if you are just starting your Dominion journey. I recommend that you always play with Dukes (and Gardens from the base game) because they allow different strategies than just gold rush to highest point green cards. For example without Gardens in play it is never good idea to make your deck bigger.

Played several times at Origins 2009 and really like that the ATTACK cards actually do some nice (read nasty) attacks on other players.  Also seems to be a lot less cards with multiple + actions, so if you don't like the interaction (read: Attacking) and just want to play a multi-person solitaire game, then stick with the base game.

I bought this one on a whim, just so that we could have a 5-player game with someone else's base set. I enjoy Dominion, but I think it's a bit over-hyped. It's a good game, but I can only play a hand or two before I'm ready to move on. I tend to stick with a straight-forward "get as much gold as possible, and cards that allow me to draw more" and I win as much as I lose -- no matter what combination of cards are in play. I think this is one of the reasons that I don't like the game. Sure, you can come up with elaborate strategies and combinations... but why? You can do just as well by filling your deck with gold.

RATING: 7
The notion of the modular expansion - where you have a number of small new elements to use in whatever combination you wish - Dominion expansions are the epitome.

25 new modules to mix and match!

The problem is that few of those modules, here and in other sets, really change how you approach playing the game. Having Great Halls in a setup, or Wishing Wells, or Trading Posts doesn't require any real difference in approach. That's true of basically every card in this particular set, which is conservative in part since it can be used stand-alone.

There is one inevitable wrinkle when playing with new cards: that's in working out if they're priced favourably or not. It doesn't take much, though, to figure out that Scout isn't incredible in most setups (experience of the card in play hardly seems necessary in this and other cases). And, given the variable value of Dominion cards (a plus action card is more valuable if its the only one available, for instance), good play is based on evaluation from principle rather than practice (i.e. having a broad plan before the game even starts). So you have situations where a new card or two are on offer, but you'd reduce your chance of winning were you to buy them. That's not much fun.

A very important deck-building game that truly set the scene alight. All those deck-, dice-, cube- and whatchamacallit-building games now flooding the market are built on the legacy of Dominion. As I personally never much liked the deck-building games I still admit that Dominion is the most important game of that lot and that Intrigue is the best (at least in my opinion) Dominion set you can get. For anyone interested in the roots of the #-building scene this is the box to pick.

If Dominion, the base game, was ever called to simple and lacking interaction, then Intrigue spices things up a bit. I recommend this one over the base game because it has a lot more to offer. A store-owner advised me to avoid this one but I didn't listen to him and I am glad I did. This isn't too complicated so I think it could be presented to new players. Great cards and makes the game a lot more intense and/or quick than some of the base cards.

Intrigue includes cards that allow players to win without adopting a big money strategy, while including some nice utility cards that aren't overpowered. Baron and Minion can completely change the way the game is played. As a result, I feel that this is a slightly more interesting stand-alone set than the core Dominion game.

The attack cards in Intrigue are stronger than their core counterparts, while the protection is lacking. Swindler can be especially devastating in the absence of thinner cards.

Being able to accommodate 5-6 players is an added bonus for owning both sets.

We like what we've seen so far, still haven't looked at all of the cards yet.  Just sort of mixing in three or four random ones in a regular Dominion game.

Now we're just selecting the 10 randomly between the two sets.  I'm going to stick this in at a nine like the base game because the two of them seem like one game to me.

So I ask myself why are these two a 9 and not an 8?  I think it's because the game is pretty short, we're not sick of the deck building and buy selection aspects, and it's different every time.

Intrigue is a very bland, more-of-the-same expansion.  It adds more variety, which can reinvigorate the base game, but it does nothing to address the weaknesses.  If you like the base game, you're going to appreciate having this expansion, as it will gives you more card interactions.  If you don't like the base game, this is going to do nothing for you.  I'm not sure the additional rules overhead is worth it, although this expansion has some interesting.  Really, it's like when another set for a CCG comes out.  Yes, there are new cards to examine, but does it [i]really[/i] make the experience better?

One game with cards from this expansion, the weird victory/treasure and victory/action cards were not seen in our setup, so the game was not that surprising. Some new things, like choosing the event of the action card, were encountered, but in the end this is good old Dominion with some extra spice. It might be just our setup, but there seemed to be lots of money.

Rated after four games, first two were two players and the last two were three players. We have used only the cards from the expansion, not mixed with the Dominion. Might be better when mixed, now all cards are more or less special and they have lots of twists. Might be more balanced when mixed, need to test that in the future.

Add a fifth game with cards from almost all of the expansions. The game was very different than the base game, because of the cards. It was still Dominion, so the expansion is doing what it should do.

One 5 player game with cards from 6 different expansions. Quite hard to comment or rate, because I don't even remember which card came from which expansion. There were lots of tricks in the cards, but the overall feeling was still Dominion, which probably means that the expansions are working as they should.

Updated after two 4 player games with similar setup as above, no change to the comment.

RATING: 9
One of the games I've played most of the times with my friends. The game that has been preferred as "first to play" with my friends and people to whom this was the first ever experience in the board game world. Super easy to teach. Explaining the basics and how the game functions might take as little as 10 minutes (I've managed to teach it in 5). The only you cannot teach is the winning strategy and card plays/actions. How to utilize your hand more efficiently is a learning process. For me it took less than 10 plays to work out my own strategy and how to dirsupt opponents' game and I can tell you I am surely not an advanced gamer.

The only thing that I and my friends changed right after the first game was the selection of kingdom cards. We use ten decks with ten different kingdom cards in each deck. So in one deck you have a Duke, Minion, Secret Chamber, Torturer, Scout, Mining Village, Well, Baron, Bridge, Nobles. In another - Swindler, Saboteur, Harem, Shanty Town, Coppersmith, Bridge, Nobles, Ironworks, Upgrade, Torturer

That way the game gets more diverse and interesting. All other rules though remain the same. The only drawback (quite seriously impacting the play) is the time it takes to complete a single play. If with the original rules you can manage a play in about 20 minutes or even a bit less then with the altered rules it may even take up to an hour to finish.

Otherwise the game is excellent and all the expansions it has just adds up to numereous card comincations and options you have to play your hand and stack up the deck.

Excellent game for a starter or even the very first purchase of a board game.

the theme intrigue is good for Dominion, and the translation into cards is good

Intrigue really adds a layer to Dominion gameplay, because some cards have several possible effect to choose from, and much more player interaction than the base game, as the name implies. the cards balance, however, isn't really good : some cards are too good, while some are hard to use. also, the playing time increased because there are many choices in cards. the 5-6P variant is okay, but not really recommended, the game is still best with 4P

the artwork style is diversed, the lines in several cards is too thick that they looked more like drawing than picture. i prefer Dominion's artwork than Intrigue's

Intrigue is not newbie-friendly, compared to Dominion, the card effects are rather complex to explain. of course i rate this as an expansion, not as base game. overall i rate it 9- . simply put, i prefer Dominion than Intrigue

Sat down to a couple games at the local game store. Intrigue is a welcome improvement on the base game; most notably in that some action cards offer you choices, so there is presumably more of a decision to be made when playing actions rather than it just being automatic. Still, I found decisions fairly obvious and didn't find the experience fundamentally different. With just skimming the new cards and going with my old Dominion habits I was still able to win every game. In the end, I think this will appeal to those who are still high on Dominion and want more. For someone like me who played the game obsessively online and then burned out there's nothing here compelling enough to reawaken my interest (I'd play again a couple times just to see all the action cards but that's probably it).

If you liked the original game, it's probably safe to say that you'll like the expansion.  It adds cards that do new things, change some things, and make you rethink the best strategy toward playing a given game.  The great thing about Dominion is that the approach you take to playing any given game differs depending on how the different cards work together.  If you like that aspect of the game, and are looking for newer, more interesting ways to apply that principle to the game, get it.  Most of the cards, though, add a lot of direct interaction, and also makes the game far more chaotic than I like.  I know that a lot of complaints about the original game was that it wasn't interactive enough, but the Intrigue cards take it far beyond what I enjoy about the game.  So much of it is ridiculously out of your control, and it becomes ultimately frustrating.

RATING: 8
A great expansion that adds quite a bit to an already very replayable base game. I was initially concerned that functional Victory cards would cause the game to lose some of its charm, but ultimately it just means more interesting decisions. Loses a point because I think overall the base game cards are better (in particular, I think the Saboteur is not suitable for 3+ player games), but still a worthy purchase for owners of the base game.

Good but not so keen on the cards that have a whole strategy based on buying lots of the same cards (I'm looking at you Minion).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Having choices along the way, and multi-function cards, helps address the lack of in-play (vs. drafting) choices in the base game.  Still a game for "perfect planners," but getting better as the available stacks grow, as I hoped it would.

I'm unsold on some of the attacks, which are generally the recourse of the players behind the curve, rather than a viable approach from the beginning.

Overall an improvement to the base game's Rainman-like play, but doesn't shift the needle quite far enough away from money.

While I adore Dominion, I wasn't especially inspired by this expansion. It doesn't have the out-of-control excitement of Prosperity (platinum!) or the novel mechanism of Seaside. The main benefit it offers is the existence of dual-purpose victory cards, which is nice, but not incredibly thrilling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I came late to the Dominion party and ended up with Intrigue, Seaside and Prosperity arriving around my birthday. My immediate thoughts were: how am I going to get through all these cards? I needn't have worried because playing Dominion is addictive. It's speedy, with not much downtime, easy to pick up, difficult to stop. The crack of card games.

RATING: 7
Player interaction is fine, and for the most part I really enjoy the expansion.  The only cards I don't care for are the ones that randomly screw with your opponents' strategies (Swindler especially).  Attacks tend to slow the game down, but they're fine when used in moderation (we usually redraw if we get too many Attacks when laying out the initial Kingdom Card decks).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a very good game, but lacks horribly in theme. The theme could be non-existent, but it doesn't really matter, as the game has interesting and simple mechanics. Having only Intrigue, there isn't that much fighting with other players, which can be a problem if you're into this kind of gameplay.
Also, the game does tire after some time, especially when usually played with 2 players. It's very simple, but at the same time, not immersing enough to make me want to play again and again. If you've never played card-based games, this may definitely be for you. Otherwise - you might wanna check out something else.

The deck building mechanic of Dominion is one of my favourites. There is a great deal of satisfaction in building chains of actions and point generation as the game progresses. Intrigue is rated higher than the base game as the types of cards are a little more interactive in an otherwise minimally interactive game

I really enjoy Intrigue more that just the base game. I haven't played Intrigue without adding other expansion/base cards to it, so I can't rate it truly based on just intrigue cards. I should try it out though.

Dominion was one of the first games that helped me get into the strategy gaming hobby. A friend of mine had the original/Seaside, so I went ahead and got intrigue.

Great box full of fun cards. My all time favorite can be found in this set: Masquerade. I also like how cards with multiple options have been introduced in this set, as well as Victory Point cards that can actually do stuff for you, instead of just chilling around. The Tribute card is also a cool card to highlight from this set.

There is one card, Saboteur, which I sometimes consider banning from games as it most of the times only slows the game down without doing anything else other than dragging the game out.

I wasn't crazy about this expansion when we played it alone, but we may have been rusty or gotten a bad spread. I should look into this more but end up just mixing everything togeter.

There are slightly more interaction/attack cards in this expansion as well as dual purpose victory cards that have other properties. Makes for interesting combos when mixed with other expansions.

I would definitely recommend regular Dominion before Intrigue. Alone, it's rating would go down to about a 7/10.

Dominion: Intrigue started the trend of making Dominion a much more involved game, and less accessible to casual gamers. It's actually better for gamers though, and didn't include any of the annoying boards, or tokens to track things. I think I've grown out of love with Dominion, and find that there are currently much better deckbuilders available.

There are lots of new ideas like cards that gives you some choices. And maan - this is a mean game (Saboteur, Trickster). But still... all important decisions are made during buying, not playing cards. What you get is what you can buy. That's it. Still - more enjoyable than base Dominion

The standalone expansion of the original; first of the series that I've played. The artwork could be better. Easy to learn. Lots of replayability (so far).

RATING: 6.5
Rated higher since there's a little bit of interaction with the attack cards (but they still can be valued by how much they disadvantage your opponents and thus, advantage you, so it still feels very much like a solo game).

RATING: 7
Some interesting cards and new mechanics - was a good addition to the base game once I'd exhausted the price there.

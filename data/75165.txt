Unique, thematic game about traveling Italy in a quest to learn and unify the regional dialects. 

The game plays out over several rounds, with a somewhat unknown finish (after 12 rounds, at any point the Pope could get ill, represented by a face down round marker, and the next time one of these shows up he dues signaling the last round), which creates real tension as some players want a long game and some need a short game to potentially win. 

On your turn, you use 5 action selection disks to choose actions (this is not worker placement as each player placed all disks, executes all actions, and the next player and so on), of which there are several to choose from: 1) gain money, which can be tight depending on your chosen path, 2) movement, an important part of the game is to travel through Italy, and you are limited in the range you can move each turn, plus movement can incur a cost if you move more than one region, 3) acquire knowledge, necessary for "reading" books, 4) acquiring books, which are region specific, require a certain level of knowledge, and score significant end game points, 5) rest which is a way to go first for the next round (or maybe not as you can get delayed/jousters here), 6) gain influence from different factions (code for purchasing different colour cubes which have different costs and different functions, and is the main place you will spend your money, and all of the cubes have real importance), 7) advance on different tracks- two of the tracks are the further ahead you push, the more end game points you score, but one is a winner take all pissing march, and the other awards only first and second and is difficult to time/access, one track is to improve knowledge in a big way but you must finish it and visit the appropriate city before game end, and one track is to improve your odds of acquiring an end game point tile.   In addition to your chosen disk actions, you can freely activate a city location that you have visited, gaining knowledge and/or possibly money. 

The most original part of this game is that while everyone starts the game as a merchant, at any point, provided you visit the right location, you can convert to a friar, which gives you a unique ability.  Once you turn religious, there is no going back. Friars can further convert to a cardinal, which again requires visiting the correct region, and is more expensive but it also gives you another, new unique power. As well religious roles, who'd generally poorer, gain charity (money) from other merchants.  All three roles are viable to winning the game, and require different strategies and d cud for if or when to change is very important. Turn order is also interesting in that the dumbest player (least knowledge acquired) goes first and you want to go first but you also want and need knowledge to acquire valuable books. 

There are several ways to score points at the end of the game, many of which revolve around the influence cubes acquired through actions.  You score for: highest value of cubes, most money, and obtaining a certain level of prestige in your given role (merchants score the least, then friars, then cardinals, with one cardinal able to ascend to pope provided they have the influence cubes and the most knowledge). 

The game plays out very differently as each game bonuses tied to each region are ordered in a semi-random fashion, a set number of influence cubes are ordered in random fashion, and the interplay of the map, and the decisions of other players as well as your own with respect to staying as a merchant or converting to religion are important to consider.  The game plays from 2-5 players, and has so far worked great at the numbers I've played (2-3).  There are some minor issues with errors in production and the board should definitely be marked up using one of the user files on this site as it is lacking in detail. This game is the definition of a hidden gem.

Ugh. This was brutal. Sure, there's balance, many things "to do," and beautiful components, but scoring was so incredibly detailed and arbitrary that it all appeared quite contrived. I'm sure there's a fine game here, but it isn't really obvious where it is, exactly. Finding it will require many plays... and as it's long in the tooth from a time perspective, that might not happen.

first outing a bit confusing and didn't manage to play to the end - quite good fun once you get the hang of what does what. found the colouring scheme a bit confusing but definitely enjoyed the game. need to re-read the rules and give it a full go.

Update: played a full 4 player game of this and it was fun but two issues - the game was too long and outstayed its welcome, and the play structure is too bitty. Also, it's a fairly tactical game in so far as it isn't always obvious what you want to do next turn until you've seen the other players take their turns. This added no doubt to the playing time.

The scores were all very close despite different strategies having been employed which was interesting. We got one rule wrong in that we allowed multiple manuscripts to be purchased by a player in their turn. The error on the player summary screens is sloppy.

So, I did enjoy the game but it felt a bit so so for me in the end.

Impressive, for an Euro it is a very thematic game. This game uses the action alocation system and is very clever in a lot of different ways, it make good use of timming on your actions, will I become religious? When will be the best oportunity for it? Will I end the game as a merchant? Will I study the old manuscripts or do I want to be the new pope? A lot of timed decisions that make this game very cool.

An excellent and surprisingly well-themed game! The only luck involved is when, precisely, the game will end; but you know that it will end sometime in the last handful of turns, so even then, there is very little randomness. Being a fan of Dante's for over thirty years now (I've even read his work De Vulgari Eloquentia in translation!) has probably helped me love the game...but apart from that, it really is a very fine game! As for the complaints about the English rulebook, I didn't find it too troublesome, apart from the absurd placing of the component illustrations and list at the end of the rules. I actually found the "re-do's" of the rules here at The Geek more confusing!

All that has been said about the greatness of DVE here in the comments I whole-heartedly agree with, so I only want to focus on the negatives which are entirely "component" related:

-there are no player aids and this is too heavy a game to be without player aids. BGG user arnodestang, however, has posted a remarkably useful player aid that I think is essential for play.

-the player screens have an error about a fairly important rule

-yes, the game is extremely well-themed, but the theme is an area with which most players (even Italians, I suspect) would be unfamiliar; and the game comes without any thematic background notes

-the board and bits are beautiful and realistic to the historical setting. That is a problem because it makes it a relatively difficult game for a colour-blind person to play.

Medium-heavy eurogame. Many paths to victory. Unique theme, supported well by the mechanics. The game uses an action point system. I found very interesting that you can change your role from merchant to monk and later cardinal. Each role has unique abilities. Badly written rulebook with ambiguous rules. To teach this game is a beast. There is a lot of downtime in 4-5 players game. Very AP prone game. Despite the negatives I liked the game.

A worthy euro that is definitely a gamers' game with perhaps an inordinate number of tangents attached to the core game play, nevertheless, with some fairly straightforward and interesting efficiency decisions.

I don't hate this Euro. It could deal with a little more player interaction (what euro can't, though?)

What I don't understand is the theme. You may as well rename this game "race for the papacy". The game claims to be about evolving the italian language, but it came down to "how many cubes can I collect, and when do I get my pope-hat?"

That said, it isn't bad.

essen 2010.  As with Siena, Mario Papini's games are more like experiences, with rules sets like sieves, where you have to fill in the holes, but plenty of flavour, more than is really required.  At the request of the other players we abandoned the game as plugging the holes was not fun or rewarding.

Csak jókat hallottam erről a játékról, és most hogy kipróbáltam, azt mondom, tényleg szuper! Nagyon egyedi és tematikus, tele jó ötlettel, és még a nehézsége és a hossza is kellemes meglepetés, mert 2 óra alatt lement egy (3 fős) parti, és annyira abnormálisan nehéznek sem éreztem (annak ellenére, hogy 1 óra volt a szabálymagyarázat). A 20+ féle akció riasztólag hathat, de általában nagy részüket ki lehet zárni, mivel a legtöbb akciónak előfeltétele van... Tehát nem a sok jó és még jobb közül kell választani, hanem inkább 3-4 jó közül néhányat. Van néhány olyan dolog, amire muszáj rámenni (kockákat és könyveket gyűjteni). De van 3-4 olyan pontszerzési lehetőség, ami közül muszáj párat kihagyni, lehetetlen mindre rámenni.
A játékra azért "csak" 8-ast adok, mert van pár bosszantó hibája, pedig egyébként kiugróan jó szerintem!
Ilyen hiba pl. a segédleten lévő hibás infó, a táblán lévő funkciótlan lapkahely (kiegnek a helye?), néhány nem egyértelmű jelölés, stb.
Ami tetszik, hogy mindegyik szereppel elérhetőnek tűnt így elsőre a győzelem. Emellett a játék nagyon szép is. Tökéletesen nyelvfüggetlen.

A very controversial game! I have many things to say but I'll just skip to the conlusion: this had the potential to be a great and euro with a very innovative theme, however it feels to be still in playtest beta version. I love the artwork and some mechanics, but many of them are obviously excessive and needed fine tuning. I expect more playtesting from Mr Papini's next game, which I am looking forward to.

The theme of this game is very unique and interesting (at least if you are italian and you are interested in your own culture!) and the players can feel the theme everywhere.
The game is meaty, there are different paths to victory and lots of different choices.
The production is gorgeous (apart from the paper-thin player screens) and very thematic too, but there's one clear misprint on the map, and the rulebook is quite convoluted and full of exceptions so it's not easy to pick up the game.
The gameplay flows surprisingly well, anyway, after all.
Good game, and the rating could easily go up with more plays.

After struggling through the complex rules, the game itself plays fluent and logical. You have the feeling of a game that has integrated the theme very well, that seems to have different paths to victory and a "I would like to play this game again" feeling because of the lot of possibilities you haven't tried in your first game.

-This game is pretty amazing. It's unlike anything I've played prior. 

-The rule set seems pretty streamlined once you've given it a few plays. The two player game is pretty good but three was much better. The event tiles are more contested and there is less of a glut of resources. The manuscript also moved along much better and it allowed for less "janky" situations where the tile market became stagnant with 2. I could see how it might be even better with 4.  

---With 2P, we play the variant involved in the setup 

- removing manuscripts -  one of each color from each level 1-3

- swap out two yellow and add two black cubes

An interesting theme about creating a unified language. I really enjoyed my play of this game. I think the action point allowance mechanics and the way players need to move and interact with the map sets this one apart from other euros that come down to collect cubes and move up tracks. It also has those aspects as well, but it does have a unique feel, a different theme, and enough decisions to make the game feel fun and challenging. 

A dry euro with a cool theme, great look, and fun decision filled gameplay!

Also in my top 5 for 2010 (and probably my #1), this is a medium-weight game with a strong theme, probably my most thematic game before I get down to Arkham Horror (which is a great game but not one with any meat).  Multiple paths to victory; scales very well from 2 to 5; varied enough for good replayability.  I've had it almost a year now and it remains one of my favorite games.

Un juego sesudo de colocación de trabajadores, ambientado en el surgimiento del italiano a partir de varios dialectos.

En línea con Caylus, Brass y cosas así.. azar nulo y mucho que pensar.

The worker allocation system reminds me of Tikal: you have a number of actions which you can use as you choose. Game play is more immersive than your typical euro: I really felt racing to become the Pope. Many interesting choices and a random setup for variety. The only thing that stops the game from being an 8 is the downtime between turns, which can be quite high with AP-prone players. Although it does not have any new mechanism, it feels fresh. Worth trying.

Based on one play at Essen 2010.

Took 45 minutes to explain, and only 2 hours to play the first 3 player game. 

This is a very MEATY game. 

Thematic for a euro. Lots of actions to select from. Also lots of competition along different tracks.

Intense and competitive the whole 2 hours. Didn't know who was going to win until the final tabulation and it was within 2 points of the winner and second place.

The game may come across as being rule intensive, however, gameplay is intuitive once you start playing.

Update Dec 2016: after 2 recent plays, quite concerned about turn order. Player 1 gets to snipe everything...take all the money and buy up all the cubes.

This is the only game that has ever made me want to rage quit during the rules explanation. The monochrome board, the hard-to-read text, the tiny, unclear pictures, the abstruse and convoluted ruleset, and a totally baffling, academic medieval theme made this one of the most frustrating-to-learn games I have ever played. If it weren't for the awesome user-created player aids on BGG and the enduring patience of my husband, I would have never had a chance to play this really excellent, interesting game.

One of the reasons the game is so daunting is that there are many ways to earn points, but you need lots of money and knowledge to do any of them. Acquiring knowledge and money thus becomes your principal obstacle (but your primary means) to get points. Figuring out "optimal" moves can be futile, especially in the early turns, because of the sheer number of options available to you. It is also hard to know whether your early actions are paying off or whether they are just wasting your time (usually, it's a little of both). Once the first game is under your belt, you will be wondering what the big fuss was all about, but man, this one was a tough one to get to the table.

For me, this game is a classic case of a well-designed game mechanically, but ultimately not very fun game, which seems to be an easy pitfall for many euros to fall into.

There are obviously some paths to victory here, and plenty of things to do, but none of it was very engaging and exciting to me (and I'm a person that generally enjoys a lot of cube-pusher type games).

Additionally, it seemed like there was a lot of fat that could have been cut from this game.  It's hard to say whether the designers just didn't quit designing soon enough, or whether the game lacked sufficient development to make the game lean and mean.  It just seemed that there were several odd little bits that were extraneous, and the game could have done without.

Overall, a fairly solidly built game that just forgot the fun and could have done with some slimming down.

Rated 6 after one play. I had no idea about this game before my first play. This is heavy Euro gaming... fo sho. Any game about Italian languages and scholarship better be geared for heavy Euro gamers.

I have mixed feelings about this one. I like the different options for scoring, the way different people (cubes) rotate into availability, and probably best of all, I really like how the movement around the map limits your possible action choices and forces some tough decisions. "Getting from A to B" can be costly.

What don't I like? The significant downtime between turns. At least with 5 players. We devolved at points where people would leave the table, knowing that they had a couple of minutes before they would be called back again. At approx. 3+ hours, there's other games I'd rather hit the table.

I'd be curious to see how this played with 3 players, particularly if they played before. If a group can get past that downtime and AP, there's probably a very intriguing game behind this most noticeable drawback.

Although I enjoyed playing the game and would play again, I wouldn't add this one to my collection.

:sugar: First a bone to pick:

Here's something I had to say about a little game called Thurn and Taxis: 

[q]between its rigorously dorky subject matter, its Germany-of-the-vaguely-indeterminate-olden-days setting, its inscrutable-to-Americans title, and its simple (but not lobotomized) level of difficulty, it's maybe the [i]Euroest[/i] Eurogame I've played.[/q]

AND NOT ONE OF YOU UNGRATEFUL BASTARDS THOUGHT TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS GAME.

So, yeah, DVE. Ineffable dorkiness. Seriously ineffable. It cannot be effed. Set in olden days Italy but whatevs. Title is [i]muy[/i] inscrutable. A bit heavier than T&T but once you clear the learning curve it's not a beast.

I was a bit iffy on this after one play but after a second it burrowed into my soul and I haven't been able to shake it. It feels like point salad but it requires a very focused strategy to win, points are actually thin on the ground, and the theme truly pervades everything.

I can't really articulate why but this is a game that defies facile comparison with anything else out there. But I like it. I hope that continues.

Overall, a reasonably interesting worker placement medium weight game with an exciting theme. Feels underdeveloped, not all possible actions seem well tuned. Rewards repeated play to optimise one's tactics, but the game is to me uninviting and dry. Mechanically, very little that we have not seen before.

Solid design, but nothing that I saw to distinguish it from its peers in this year's crop of new Euros. I enjoy the theme. The graphic design choices were less functional than they could have used. There are several times where I just can't read the board from a normal seated position.

I look forward to playing again, but I probably won't go out of my way to do so...and feel no need to own a copy.

The manual to this game is horrendous: instead of just stating that this worker placement, we have an extensive thematic explanation which does more than get in the way of quick understanding of DVE is about. In any way, if you survive the rules, the game is surprisingly smooth sailing from that moment onwards. 

But also boring and formulaic, all the more so when the game begins to draw to a close. What happens is that actions are expended to generate money and knowledge, the two main currencies of this game (although the latter cannot be paid with). Money is used for travel, or for hiring Important People who can help you in a few significant ways. Knowledge gives you a better understanding of language, and allows you to collect more and more complex manuscripts in the 'vulgar tongue' which are worth VPs at the end of the game. Then there are several tracks which you progress on and generate VPs in certain ways (random amount, progression needed all to the end, whoever gets the furthest, or passing milestones). Overlaid on that is the possibility of several 'careers' which limit options (especially those of the money-gathering) but can also bring in big VPs. 

To be honest, the playing rythm [i]is[/i] smooth. It helps considerably that people get only 5 action points to play with, and have (with just once exception) no way to augment this number. Thus there are no (extremal) efficiency or games to be played, keeping matters simple. At the same time there becomes less and less to do as the game progresses. Options on the map, once taken, remain taken; this necessitates further and further travel which gets rather boring. There is a bit of subtle timing involved in when to switch to a career in the church because the richest merchant can be forced to give up a sizable (and unsustainable) amount of money, thus reducing competition for the victory. But if you convert too late, you will not obtain sufficient money or influence to really profit. 

The question is really whether that last consideration is sufficient to carry the game through multiple plays. I happen to think it doesn't, resulting in a game which is, perhaps even a little sadly, rather forgettable.

Quit engaging. Gaming experience is quit fulfilling as I felt like playing a life story. Many strategic choices too. Problems: hard to teach/learn, rules fiddly, printing errors on the map and player screen. A unique game to keep. Sold it in hope to have a more polished version in the future. Only tried 2p, more players might be better.

I liked De Vulgari Eloquentia a lot, but I have learned that action point allocation games don't get a lot of play in my family or with my regular group. The game can drag because each player must wait for the others to complete their plays. I like the additional choices the promotion to Monk and Cardinal provide.

RATING: 8
Great Euro that stands out from all those soulless ones. This one has a unique theme that is reflected in the gameplay, and fun gameplay at that. 

We played a four-player game where we were all learning as we went. We got a few rules wrong, but overall, I loved the game. I love the esoteric theme, and how the gameplay tells a narrative with the players taking part in creating the language. Includes some character/career progression as the players choose which path their character takes. 

Art on the box cover and game board is attractive as well. This is another game that I find myself pondering well after it has finished. 

For those who have read other comments on this game and are wondering, it is action point allowance not a worker placement mechanic used here. 

Easy to forget rules:
-Player Aid mistake with votes of Noble and Politician cubes (rulebook is correct).
-VPs from Cardinal tile do not count if that player elected Pope.
-Charity ends after turn 11. 
-Turns 14-16, players can advance on Canticle of the Sun track from *any* Franciscan city.

I have only played this with 2p, which is clearly not its best number. However, even with the mechanics a bit skewed, we have found it to be a lot of fun. It's not a simple game, and in each of our first three plays we continued to find new rules that we had previously flubbed, but the unique theme is very well integrated and the game really does a great job of providing players with an interesting narrative arc.

I enjoyed my one play, but this is very rules fiddly (i.e. things like "you can only buy on this track on turns 2, 6, 10,11,12 if you are in the correct city for that turn and then from any canonical city after turn 14").  I felt like I also should be patting my head and rubbing my stomach while singing Ave Maria...

The game also felt about an hour too long.

I prefer complex games with simple rules.  I would play this on occasion but it's fiddliness would probably keep me from suggesting it.

RATING: 6
This is a pretty good game, just not a great one.

This game is beautiful to look at and has an interesting and engaging theme, but the gameplay falls (a little) short of the promise.

The gameplay suffers some because, while there are many decisions to be made, many times those decisions are not necessarily very interesting. On some of the turns, some very satisfying plans can be made... but other times, your options will be limited and mundane or obvious.

The theme fails a bit, too. For example, you are supposed to be collecting manuscripts in various dialects in order to ultimately discover or establish the Volgare language. However, the manuscripts (literally) function as nothing other than VP chits.

On the other hand, strategies and paths to victory are numerous and varied. This game really is a mixed bag.

Learning the game from the rulebook is a challenge, which made me expect a very heavy game... but after about a third of a game, it's really pretty smooth and mostly intuitive. (However, there will be more than a little downtime in this game--even with two players, we found it slow at times. And downtime rarely bothers us, since we both have some AP.)

Not sure I like this one.  We had to abandon our game about 2/3rds of the way through because it was taking so long.  So we skipped to final scoring to just get a feel of the scoring.  I want to try it again so that's a good thing.  But there were several at the table that wanted no part of another game.

There are a lot of different things you can do with your actions.  Games like this often are AP prone.  And if you take a 5er game where no one has played before, it was really slow going with lots of downtime.

The strange thing is that there are some turns where you you actually haven't many options with your actions.  This felt strange.  You do a bunch of stuff which doesn't further your position.  Kind of like collecting cubes just for the sake of collecting.

De Vulgari Eloquentia is unfortunately a bit of a failure of a game, lacking any measurable amount of tension or interest, with decisions largely inconsequential in lower player counts and down time egregious in larger ones. I could go into the numerous ways that this game is bad, but it really does not deserve that amount of time and energy. It is easiest to simply say, “Don’t buy it.”

De Vulgari Eloquentia is an epic game. Themed around the development of the Italian language (of course!) you begin as Merchants, travelling around Italy, transcribing manuscripts as you go. You may choose to go into the Church and follow the path of a Friar, or you can remain a merchant. There are many paths to follow, many objectives to achieve, and much much to do. 

This is a deeply rich Euro with a strong narrative thread throughout the game. It is less streamlined and less cleverly efficient than a Feld, perhaps think more along the lines of a Sergio Leone Movie: unpredictable, intriguing, not exactly what you are expecting, and something you get deeply immersed with.

A great gaming experience dripping with theme.  Can't wait to play it again.  Lots to explore and each play offers new possibilities.  Just choosing a different friar or cardinal makes a big difference in how you play and which path you take.  Dinged 0.5 until I figure out how a merchant can win.

Don't even let AP players in the same room with this one!

This game is a lot of fun,and has a great and esoteric theme.  My only complaints are that the rule book isn't great and the board would be better if the names of the tracts were printed on it.  There are additional rule books in the file section of De Vulagari Eloquentia's BGG entry.  I use three of the rule books/summaries to some extent, and, if I ever get the time, may create a new version that combines the positives of each.  There are also forums on here that describe how to affix your own track name labels, which I may also do, if I ever get the time.  I am very glad, though, that after having this in my game closet for over two years, I finally got it to the table.  I would definitely play it again.

Physically attractive game. Interesting theme, but the game fails to evoke it; doesn't engage the imagination.  Fiddly.  Overstays its welcome by about an hour.  A multi-player solitaire game with no real opportunity to affect one's opponents.  Awful rulebook makes learning and playing the game harder than it should be.  Muted pastel color scheme very difficult to interpret for this slightly color blind user. 

Some scoring mechanisms seem pointless; for example, the Papal Library track - position on the track determines the difference, at most, between two and four victory points.  Also, strangely, accumulated knowledge plays almost no part in final scoring, though a track to account for it wraps around the entire board.  Turn track has no place for the turn marker to stand.

To me, the game had the feel of a prototype still in need of play testing.

RATING: 7
It's cool to see a game that has a little more theme than just 'we're traders going around the Italy again.' It's also nice to see a map you actually move around on versus dropping pieces from some floating point. 

First of all, DVE is a little too long for what you get out of it. This isn't a serious problem, but for someone who is sensitive to game length, such as myself, this is a problem. The rules are way too sloppy for a game of this complexity, too. The level of downtime is fairly significant for a modern Euro game. 

All and all, DVE has a fresh feeling, so I will be hapy again to play it in the future, but I also realize it's going to stay a 2nd tier (but possibly a high one) game in my mind.

The novelty in the design is that you start off as a merchant, and when you go to a city and take the "interact" action, you get paid the number of coins that city gives you. Later in the game you can go to a monastery and become a friar instead. You no longer get coins when you interact with a city, however, friars and cardinals give you bonus actions and end game points. Moreover, you can upgrade one more time to a cardinal and then you can possibly be voted the Pope at the end of the game. At the same time, you can remain a merchant and go for different endgame VPs.

That all sounds reasonably interesting but the fatal flaw is that on each turn you get 5 action discs to take actions with. Turn order is relative (and there's a space to use your discs to improve your turn order position) such that you often would go first and then immediately last. This meant that you'd often have to wait for the other 4 players (5P game) to take their actions twice before you went again. That's 4 players x 5 actions x 2 = 40 actions before it would be your turn again.

The kicker is that on your turn you would only make incremental changes in your position. If you're going to make me wait 40 actions before my next move, at least let me make a monster move when it's my turn not something piddly then have to wait for another turn for another micro advancement.

Underappreciated on BGG, DVE is a fairly light, loosely structured game with a big rules overhead because its terrible rule book obscures how fast the game plays once you know the action-point options. 

Two-player BBG variants worth implementing: substitute two abbesses for two noblemen during set up and allow the player to take two papal library volumes if he reaches two, three, or four on the track.

An oddball Euro hampered by some bad graphic design (mostly things being too tiny). A good number of different things to watch/do each turn...so maybe a bit too point-salad-y for my taste.

Despite the massively overlong rules set, the unclear and convoluted rules, the misprint on the board, the confusing colours, the unhelpful board design, the strange scoring, and general bafflement, we did actually enjoy this game. Once you figure out what is happening, when and how, it plays quickly and has some nice ideas. The ways to collect VPs seems unbalanced, we'd have made better decisions had we foreseen, but we'll certainly give this another go.

Do your friends a favour and read it through and play it solo a bit first, just to figure it out. But for gamers,  it is worth the effort.

Very good and solid game. All mechanisms fit very well into the theme, every single aspect of the game make sense :
- amanuenses allows you to progress on the knowledge track (you learn the art of written from them)
- abbesses gives you favors (for the research of Canticle of the Sun) and recommendation (for the university of Bologna)
- noblemen allows you to earn money or become Cardinal
- politician allows you to become Cardinal (you must buy them;-))
- Orient track let you find new opportunities and new trading with Orient countries
- Salterio gives you knowledge by studying the prayer book
- messenger track allows you to collect knowledge of the university of Bologna, the oldest one of the western world
- papal libray track allows you to study and take a book in the city of Vatican
- taking manuscripts requires a certain level of knowledge and a certain spoken dialect

A lot of choice throughout the game :
- should i play a rich or poor merchant ?
- should i play for friar only and plan to be monk ?
- should i play for friar only and plan to be camerlengo or even pope ?
- should i take lots of manuscripts, should i focus on others VP sources or a mix ?

The game is a race :
- for knowledge to take manuscripts
- for support to be elected to a higher status

This game tells you a story as you travel through Italy and this is very unusual for a game.

I love it and want to play it again and again.

Only one issue for me : the explanation is a little bit long (30-45 minutes) to introduce beginners.

EDIT : after 5 games with people who know the game, i increased my rating from 9 to 10. The subtle (hidden?) interaction is revealed. This game could be very violent.
Always this feeling to explore a new path in every new game. Amazing replayability.

DVE is a game that has some very interesting ideas going for it, but is a complete mess in enough other areas that I'm not sure I'd want to play it again. I think the theme is great and the game is actually easy to play, but with tough decisions. Unfortunately, the rulebook does a terrible job on conveying the integration of the mechanics, which you don't figure out until you start playing.  I like the artwork, though for a game that is very unique in theme, it does little to actually teach the players about the theme.  (Not that games have to, but this game should have done a better job at it considering in uniqueness.)  In the end, this is actually a fluid enough action point game with a host of rule peculiarities that were supposed to bring the theme to life (but never really did).  There are much better games that do similar things, so I don't see a reason to play this again. But there is enough interesting parts of DVE that I would hope the designer's next game re-uses some of the ideas from it but perhaps makes it leaner and more focused mechanically.

LOVED the first play. Our heads were swimming through the rules explanation. Occasionally everyone had to catch their breath before we plowed on. But when the game began...the first turn took approximately 5 minutes! Then the game continued to speed along. I was very happy with the pacing of the game, how it developed and unfolded quickly. I enjoyed watching players set themselves up for reaching events and reading particular manuscripts. We had one player reach level 4 knowledge while remaining a merchant and another player become pope, yet the scores in our 3 player game were incredibly close: 56, 58, 61.

Sure we got a rule or two wrong, and the mistake on the player screens (black = 3 votes, red = 2 votes) threw a wrench in players' plans, but the overall experience was grand and I can't wait to play again.

PS...as an ex-seminarian turned agnostic, I relished the opportunity to move along the religious path toward the papacy. What other game lets you become pope?

Another annoyingly over-designed and overly complicated Eurogame with a big rule book with way too many strange exceptions.  It features 12 different scoring categories and a number of special cases in the rules which were obviously introduced to fix various balance problems.  To make things worse, the graphics used on the board are more or less meaningless and do not help with the complicated mechanism.  I have no problems with long and/or heavy games but this is a cumbersome and non-elegant hulk of a game which will most probably never hit our table again.

RATING: 7.5
This is a beautiful game, which should be better appreciated, but appears to have gone out of print and may shortly be difficult to grab up.

It's a thematic worker placement, set in re-Renaissance Italy, with a fairly unique theme- players work to learn language and literture as the regional languages of Itlaian states became one langauge, Italiano, de Vulgari eloquentia.

Players begin as merchants, who can accumulate large amounts of money in trade, while travelling, advancing in knowledge, and reading manuscripts from the Italian city-states and regions.

They can however become Friars, and these Churchmen can become Cardinals. Churchmen cannot engage in the same trade that merchants do, but merchants much donate charitably to support churchmen each round unless they are too poor to do so, in which case the bank provides the donated amount as a stipend.

Movement is expensive in the game, so players need to plan where they would like to be, as well as the resources they might need at key times of the game.

Players also need to decide if/when they might switch to a Church career- too early and they may have difficulty collecting needed supporters and miss out on easy earnings, but too late and they may not have the funds they need to advance to Cardinal, and gain access to the large Volgare Point bonuses available to those advancing to Benedictine, Camerlengo or even Papal status.

In addition, there are large point rewards for proceeding farthest on the tracks for the Veronese Riddle, and the Laudes Creaturarum (or Canticle of the Sun), and smaller ones for gaining access to the Papal Library via that track.

Players have to decide where they will use their resources to advance- choices abound, and the rounds of play move quickly.

Because of the many choices, and players min/maxing in their heads, there might be a certain tendency to AP in this game, but the choices are not so complex that this is necessary, or a major flaw.

I found this- once the players know the game- to be a quick-playing mid-weight euro WITH plenty of thematic setting, beautiful artwork and a well-crafted storyline.

After playing this the first time, we immediately set it up and played it again, in half the time the fist play took, and had a great time with it.

I'm starting this at a 7.25.  It's a solid, much better than average, beautiful game, and Papini deserves more attention than he gets if he can craft a very personal yet solid game such as this.  A real pity it's headed out of print.

This is a solid, thinky Euro, with multiple paths to victory and lotsa moving parts. But what really sets it apart for me is the theme. I love these esoteric, academic themes, and I'm happy to support publishers who step outside the box for stuff like this.

RATING: 9
Es un juego italiano editado por Homoludicus en español que trata sobre el nacimiento del italiano como lengua de comunicación entre mercaderes de la Italia medieval. Un tema muy interesante, pero que difícilmente se ve representado en un juego.

Particularmente disfruto con juegos poco conocidos, que no sean mainstream dentro del mundillo y DvE es el ejemplo arquetípico. Pero reconozco que es como el Gin Tonic con pepino. Sólo para unos pocos.

Brevemente, el juego consiste en gastar 5 puntos de acciones en moverse por el mapa, conseguir dinero, estudiar el Salterio, usar la biblioteca papal, estudiar el "acertijo de Verona", usar mensajeros para poder entrar en la universidad de Bolonia, estudiar el cántico al sol de S. Francisco de Asis, estudiar un dialecto a base de comprar libros escritos en él, descansar, adquirir influencia política, clerical, abades o amanuenses, hacer negocios para ganar dinero, hacerse fraile, hacerse cardenal, usar las abadesas para obtener influencia... Vamos: muchas opciones que hacen el juego demasiado largo para lo que es en realidad: un juego de puntos de acción y, en neto, una carrera por convertirse en Papa. Son tantas las opciones, que no queda claro del todo si hay estrategia a seguir en él, o simplemente, decidir qué da más puntos en cada momento y tratar de alcanzarlo. Demasiadas opciones, además, requieren que estés en determinado sitio del tablero en determinado turno.

Me surgen demasiadas preguntas. ¿Por qué un cubo rojo es tan caro - 15 monedas - y su uso es tan limitado en el juego? ¿Por qué los cubos negros son gratis y además superiores a los amarillos que si valen dinero? ¿Por qué hay un registro que sólo avanza en el turno 2,6,10,11,12 y 12+? ¿Por qué hay otro registro que cuesta acciones mejorarlo pero que sólo el primero llega a puntuar en él? ¿Por qué el mercader necesita 6 acciones para lograr 10 monedas si luego las tiene que repartir entre el resto de jugadores que sean clérigos?

Además, lo más gordo es que, con frecuencia, si eres el 1º en un turno, en el siguiente serás el último. Esto implica, que en el juego a 5 jugadores hay que esperar unas 40 acciones para volver a jugar. A ver cómo está el juego para entonces...

Sin embargo, es inmersivo. Tu personaje puede seguir en el mundo de los negocios o bien, optar por la vía religiosa, hacerse fraile, luego benedictino para pasar a ser obispo, camarlengo o incluso papa. Viajarás por italia recogiendo escritos con el fin de estudiarlos y lograr una lengua común. Podrás visitar la biblioteca papal y ser incluso, testigo del nombramiento de Federico II en Brindisi, el Stupor Mundi. En definitiva, el juego se va desplegando conforme la partida se desarrolla y este "camino vital" que sigue tu "personaje" sólo lo he visto implementado en juegos como Runebound y en otros del estilo "rol de tablero"

Todo esto, más un reglamento farragoso que pone a prueba al jugador más avezado cuando lo lee por vez primera, hace que sea un juego para sacar de ciento en viento y sólo con hardcore gamers.

[ENG]

It´s an Italian game released by Homoludicus in Spanish language which is about the begining of the Italian  as communication language between traders of the medieval Italy. A pretty interesting theme, but really difficult to represent it on a game.

Particularly, I enjoy so much whith non well known games that aren´t mainstream games in the gamer´s world, and DVE is the best example. On the other hand, I recognize that DVE is like the cucumber´s Gin&Tonic: just for a few people.

Summarizing, the game consists on using 5 action points in different situations: moving across a map, obtaining money, studying the Salterio (a cristian book), using Pope´s Library, studying the "Verona´s riddle", using messengers and apply for a place in Verona´s University, studying St. Francisco´s "Sun Chant", studying dialects based on buying books written on them, resting, obtaining political,or clerical influence, obtaining abbeys or monks, making business and obtaining money, becoming a friar, becoming a cardinal... A lot of options that make game so long. Actually it´s a game about Action Points and a race based on being the first to become the next Pope.

There are a lot of options and it´s not clear if there is a strategy or not. It seems easier to notice what´s the best movement (the one which gives you more Victoy Points) and, well, just going for it. Further, some options requieres you stay in THE place just in THE correct turn...

After reading the rules an a 4p game, I´ve a lot of questions. Why a red cube is so expensive -15 coins-? Why has it a limitated use in the game? Why are free the black cubes? Why are they better than the yellow ones? Why the yellow cubes are not free? Why there is a track that only advances in turns 2,6,10,11,12 and 12+? Why there is another track where you have to use Action Points to advance it? Why needs the trader 6 actions to obtain 10 coins? Why must he share the coins with the cleric players?

Futher and over the top is this fact: When you´re the 1st in turn, usually you´ll be last on the next turn. What does it mean? You´ll wait 40 actions until you can play again. Can you imagine your next movement after 40 action points? I can´t.

However, the game´s immersive. Your character can stay on the business world or take the religious choice, becoming a friar, after this becoming Benedictine, after bishop and becoming the next Pope! You could visit the Pope´s library and be witness of the arrival of Frederick the Second "Stupor Mundi".

In short , the game is displayed when the game´s plot progresses and it forms a "life path" of your "character". I´ve only seen it in Role Playing Games and games like Runebound, but it has a knotty rules, so I think it´s a hardcore gamer´s game.

Gestionale che unisce interessanti meccaniche di ottimizzazione delle azioni, ad altre di movimento sul tabellone, ad altre ancora di evoluzione del proprio personaggio, che può "far carriera" sia tra i mercanti che tra i frati. Per evitare il trauma del brusco impatto contro il regolamento - sotto alcuni aspetti troppo raffinato ed inutilmente barocco - andrebbe provato con qualcuno che già lo conosce. Sicuramente, nel complesso, un gioco originale, destinato a giocatori accaniti.

Really solid design, but I have some reservations:

- I've got doubts about usefulness of some options in the game/balance
- the game tends to be longish (I don't know why - action selection be should fast and simple - but the game drags... (AP from some players?))
But the biggest issue for me is that the game fails to stand out of the crowd (beside chrome (Papini's trademark) - expressed with plenty of add-on, non-essential mechanisms/rules).  It's a working game, but it doesn't work as a magnet for me.  After 2 plays I'm full and that's not a good sign..

--

Some people won't like lengthy rules (although playing the game is - in mechanical sense - easy and not fiddly at all).  Personally, gaps in the rules annoy me much more.  The board could be more ergonomic too.

I don't think about the game in a bad way, but I'm not attracted to it at the same time.

Sold.

The mechanics of this game, while solid, aren't really the draw of this game. The real special thing about this game is the theme. It's just so cool wandering across Italy collecting manuscripts in various languages, working on translations of great works, and accumulating political allies to help you move up in station potentially even becoming the next pope. But also let me be clear, the mechanics are good. For example the decision of if and when to give up the merchant life and join the church is really cool, since the dynamics of money change so much. And then eventually moving up the hierarchy and becoming a cardinal is really cool too, since there are five options for monks and five for cardinals with unique special powers.

De Vulgari Eloquentia was one of my oldest unplayed games. I bought it on 2013 and I only played it until this month. I have only heard positives about it so my expectations about it was very high, however it disappointed me.

The rules aren’t very complex, but learning them from the game manual took some time. It could be much better redacted and there are some mistakes in the player´s shields. You can explain the rules under 18 minutes. After reading the rules I thought the game was great, but it was a boring experience because the game has a lot of downtime and is very long for what it offers. Perhaps it is best as a 3 player game.

The game components are ok, but the art could be clearer, many of the icons are rather small and similar looking from a short distance.

The theme is unique and very interesting.

I like the mechanism in which the merchants have to pay charity to the clerical players. In our game I was the richest merchant and I was always out of money :D. I also like that players can convert to friars/cardinals and the random ending of the game (when the pope dies). 

The game decisions aren’t obvious, you have 5 action points and you need to decide in what to spend them (where to move, which cubes to take, in which track to advance, should I became a friar/cardinal?, should I win money?, should I rest?, should I acquire books?, should I try to be the pope?). The game is highly strategic, to use the actions you really need to plan ahead. I should love the game but I don’t.

De Vulgari Eloquentia is a meaty game (a huge plus), but l found it a boring endeavor. You have a plethora of actions to do each turn, but after some turns you realize that all your actions don’t amount to much. The luck factor with the books (how and where they appear) is high and uncontrollable (a huge minus for me) and that’s a shame. The game lends itself to AP, so the downtime is exceedingly high (and that’s one of the worst sins a game can commit in my book) with 4 players or more, I haven’t played with less, but it seems that the game would be a lot less tense in that case. De Vulgari Eloquentia is a long game and a long game with lots of downtime is a boring game, many times you play first in a round and then you play last, so you have to endure 6 turns in a row before you play again and all players are trying to maximize their play, so you can probably sleep a little between turns. 

Bottom line, I really wanted to like De Vulgari Eloquentia but it disappointed me. I’m willing to give it another chance, but the downtime is too much for me. The luck factor is high and that´s awful in a long strategy game. There is no reason to play the game again when there are many good Euro games out there that really excite me. It is way too long for what it offers and, ultimately, it was very boring for us. It has some really nice ideas, but I’m selling it ASAP.

I have to believe this is one of the most under-appreciated games out there.  I am guessing this is mostly because of how bad the rules are written, but once you get over that hump, this game is a hidden gem.

To those who rated this low after one play or because of complaints of downtime..... you need a gaming group.   Our group played this in under three hours with five.  We did use a timer, but most of us were not rushed.   We all had played the game before.  So, if you played it once, I recommend giving it a second try.   For me, it gets better each time.

One other note: the game is very well-balanced.   One of the players in our game missed winning as a merchant by one yellow cube.   Don't be fooled into thinking the only way to win is to become Pope.   The best part of the game for me is the fact that there are many ways to win making the replayability very high.

(Note: played once but we couldn't bring ourselves to finish the whole game).

A mechanistic spreadsheet with no apparent theme integration, user-hostile and incredibly ugly graphic design, and gameplay that's about as compelling as watching paint dry. The game has an action point mechanism with 15 or so different possible actions with the only reminder of the possible actions being various almost identical looking medieval-style paintings printed next to the gazillion tracks on the board. Unlike a normal action point game your main problem won't be figuring out how to do all that you want with the limited number of action disks. Instead it's decide on a useless track on which to dump all the actions that you have no use for.

On the plus side, I think it would play pretty quickly once you get over the hump of the totally impenetrable rulebook.

I'm glad I had a chance of playing this before looking to purchase the game.  Overall, the game is fine, but I don't have any interest in playing again.

LIKES:

* The different roles/routes one can take adds an interesting dynamic to the game as well as the decision of when to change a role (IE become a priest).  I do like that the friars and cardinals get their money from the wealthiest merchant.
* There appear to be several viable ways of being competitive and winning the game.
* There can be some nasty competition for a couple scoring options which give the runner ups 0 points or 3rd and 4th 0 points.  Be prepared to fight hard for those areas you want points.  You can also mess with people in the knowledge tablets by taking what they most want. 
* 14 different actions exist of which you can only take a maximum of 5 (unless you have the cardinal which grants an extra action).  However, some actions require more than one action disc.

DISLIKES:

* While you want to keep a long range plan in mind, the game is largely tactical in that you wait while others take their turn and then you make your moves.  There is nothing you will do when others take their turn leading to a significant amount of down time.
* The map is too small on which the pawns move.  It is often hard to see what the rewards of each area are and sometimes to discern the color.
* Personally, I didn't find the game all that dynamic.  I enjoyed playing, but this will not be a game which I request to play.  Basically, this is another worker placement game, and I would prefer other worker placement games to this one.
* Despite 14 actions to choose from, a number of actions seemed quite pointless much of the time.

Terrible, terrible name. No wonder this game is at bargain bins everywhere. And what [expletive] made the board and didn't make obvious that water is between the islands? Just a few oversights. It's not like these people are novices at producing games, so there is no excuse here. And why not show the cubes on the board in the order of their priority??? say, Red-Black-Yellow-Green from top to bottom, rather than the random order given (probably alphabetical in Italian or some such). Show water between the islands, nah! Why bother? We can't even be bothered to use one definition for a term when 4 will do! And when we can get away with it, we'll use 5.

A whole lotta implying going on here.

This game starts at a deficit of at least -2 rating points.

The game itself looks otherwise very nice. Could it reach 8? Maybe... stay tuned.

Quite an imaginative and suspenseful worker-placement game that was obviously the product of intensive research into Italian renaissance culture. What's truly bizarre about it is that none of the historical background is delivered up in the rules, which are clear but absolutely minimal. What the hell WAS the "Riddle of Verona?" Who was the "Stupor Mundi?" What "events" to the event tiles actually signify? If the publishers had included a decently written, historically informative rulebook like that of TWILIGHT STRUGGLE, this game might have really captured gamers' imagination. Without such background material, it still makes for a perfectly entertaining abstract, but the win conditions feel weirdly out of sync with gameplay, and frankly a bit chaotic.

In [b][thing=75165][/thing][/b], you are an Italian merchant who has decided to do their part and unify the Italian dialects into one language.  What could be more fun than spending ninety minutes doing that?!?  Your little merchant travels around Italy earning money and doing research.  At the same time, your collecting manuscripts and recruiting notables to your mission.  To gain the Vatican's help, you can even take up orders and become a friar, a Cardinal and even Pope.  For what is essentially a point salad game, the theme is rather strong.  And for that, I enjoyed it more than I expected.

Played only a 2p game and I had positive feelings, although I guess the gaming experience would get drastically better at higher player count. The election phase seems to loose importance with just two people racing for the highest amount of points and also travelling can be less interesting if nobody suddenly catches the manuscripts you were looking for. 
That being said, there's a nice mix of possibilities throughout the game, so you can change your own strategy at any point. 
Materials are fine and I really love the artwork but the board is poorly organized, actions spaces are put where they are for no apparent reason, so for the first game (at least) you cannot figure out everything you can do with just one quick loock at the board. This makes it less enjoyable than it could be.

Disclaimer, I was born in Italy and went to school in Italy before emigrating to the United States, so this game strikes some personal chords that raise my personal enjoyment and will not equally resonate with others.  It is also odd and unusual enough in setting to make it have a special place in the collection.  First, I'll start with the bad:  many rules, the game well deserves the 3.63 weight, even after studying the rules and with player aids I missed a lot of rules in the first play.  Long set up and take down time due to the many chits.  Fairly long explanation time, requiring a patient audience.  Some find the graphics too small to read, and there are some QA problems and misprints.  Now for the good:  this is a fun game, beautiful to look at, smooth to play, with many choices and many paths to victory and a feeling of freedom in shaping your own path.  I also like the theme (as in look and feel of the game) -- although it is just a coat of paint and has nothing to do with the mechanics  (from that point of view the  game does not have a real theme) it is a beautiful coat of paint.  There is little feeling of downtime unless one of the players is stumped by the many options, playing for the first time, or AP prone.  The turns flow one after the other, the actions flow is quick and smooth, the length of play is not too long.  There is not a lot of interaction among the players, but there is enough interaction that it does not feel MPS.  Whether it's the timing, turn order, charity, or taking that elector you needed to become Pope before somebody else, you are playing with the other players while immersed in the beautiful setting.  Looking forward to playing this again, the rules explanation is a barrier to getting it to the table but my enthusiasm is enough that I will suggest it again.  It passes the most important test I have when playing a game -- it makes me smile of joy while I am playing.

I´ve had more than twenty plays. It ´s a great game. In my opinion, it gets even better with a variant or two on the rules. 

The Pope´s library is the one that deserves a variant, otherwise it is not very important, since everyone manage to get a book (value of 2-4 points, maximum difference between players will be 2 points, ok, this is a close end game, but it is too much on the luck factor). Let a player keep up to two books with only one chance to take them (if a player gets to the point of #2 or more on the track). This makes the track more interesting (may give 4-8 points and reward the investiment on this track).

RATING: 8
This is, for me at least, an example of the "don't judge a book by its cover" maxim. This game is not much to look at. Compared to itself, the Mojave Desert is jealous at how dry this game looks. It is kind of washed-out looking and does not warrant a second glance from passers by. Theme?!? ... all I can tell you, after the initial play is that it's about Italy, merchants and religion, beyond that... to hell if I know what the game was about. But such is the case with most Euros, simply theme-less. There is no way I will ever remember the name either. 

However, having said that, I found the game QUITE enjoyable! Surprisingly so! This game is NOT for everyone, that is for sure. But for me it was a huge success. I found a fascination with all the different choices and paths to victory. Once you slogged through the rules explanation, (which was a CHORE I am glad I didn't have), the choices were simple really (could be a touch AP prone for some). The mechanics were smooth , the choices were simple, albeit numerous. I look forward to more plays very soon.

Played 5-10 times.

Update: With the files here on BGG the game is much easier to teach and learn. It´s insane to publish a game like this without any player aides, and why don´t they explain the Bologna track properly on the board, and why did they pick those colours? However, the game is surprisingly beginner-friendly in that you can always do _something_, and you can ignore some tracks and still win. Up to an 8 again.

I really want to like this one. It´s a bit quirky, a tad too long, the board should have been more informative, but I like the theme, the different career paths, and I´d be happy to play it a fourth and a fifth time. With four players rather than five, I think.

Playing time w/ new players and max.number of turns: 2,5 hrs.

Very enjoyable first play with 2 players.  You must plan multiple moves ahead while keeping your options open in the event that an opponent does something (intentional or not) to thwart your plans.  Often I found myself wanting "just one more action," which is typically a sign of a good game.  The variability in setup and endgame timing are also features I enjoy and will likely give the game a great deal of re-playability.

My only complaint is that a player can only hold a single papal VP tile (available from round 12 on) and that their values range only from 2-4 VP.  It seems bizarre to spend 7-8 actions to choose 1 out of 4 tiles rather than just spending 1 action and taking the top tile.  At most you are gaining 2 VP from many additional actions.

I'm not exactly what it is about this game, but it feels much grander than just playing a board game.  There's so many decisions to make and so many paths to take that I really feel heavily invested when playing this game.  Every game I learn something new and see different strategies succeed.  After every game, I'm thinking about what I did, what my opponents did, and what would've happened if things had happened just a little differently.  I worry about the overall balance and replayability, as certain strategies may prove superior to others, but I've greatly enjoyed playing this one so far.

Nice Euro game that has taken a very difficult theme and fit it into some good strategy and long-range planning.  Similar to his previous Siena, there is a fine choice to make as to when (if?) you progress from a merchant to a friar.  Do you try to be the Pope?  Where do you invest your limited actions?  Works well, and eager to play again.

It's rare to find a theme based on monks translating texts.  At first I had no idea what was going on, only because each action available has some crazy Latin or Volgare name.  Once you get past the De Vulgari Eloquentia's language it's an action point/ worker placement game with an interesting movement system along a map of Italy.  There are a few paths to victory and it's probably worth another try although my initial reaction was luke-warm.

-------------------
Rating after first play. 

This is technically more of a sandbox game - a game where the theme is at the forefront of almost all game decisions, and why players might choose to make one set of choices over another is never clear, but definitely tells a good story. It's like a Phil Eklund euro.

On one hand this is the sort of low-interaction victory-point salad that I normally feel intense contempt for. On the other hand, this is a euro with great thematic integration, and thinking back over my first game (2 player), I realized there were some compelling stories that developed via emergent narrative. One player, a merchant, sought to evolve the language as he developed his economic powers in order to bring economic advantage. At the end of the game he was named head banker, and retired a wealthy and powerful man with the support of many nobles and politicians. The other player sought a life of study and solitude, and traveled Italy seeking the secrets of lost manuscripts and ancient texts, rising eventually to Cardinal, but lacking the political clout to become elected pope. Still, his hard work and frugality paid off and be decoding the Canticle of the Sun and mastering the Riddle of Verona, he managed to exceed the merchant banker in knowledge of Volgare to obtain victory.

So that's the game. A somewhat snoozy Feld-like euro that actually tells a pretty charming story of the evolution of the Italian language.

Bizarre game. It seems the way to win is to pick exactly what you want to try to accomplish at the very beginning of the game, and then do it. 

A lot of things can be counted up [actions, money, time, etc] with near exactitude, but there is some blocking conflict and some randomness to contend with.

One of the best games of 2010.
Complex, competitive, with difficult decisions and, great diversity. The gameplay it excellent, fast and fluid.
One of the best euros I've played in the last couple of years. Played two 4-player games in a row and enjoy it a lot. I don't remember doing that, unless for playtesting my games.
I just don't give it a 9, because the theme seems totally abstract to me, and it have some dead tracks, because the score rating turns very low.

RATING: 9
A superb Euro. Lots of different routes to victory points. The plot revolves around bringing the Volgare language to all of Italy, and the game end condition is brought about by the Pope dying! What more could you ask?

Some friends and I thoroughly agree that if this game were brought out a few years earlier, it would be right up there with Caylus. The fact that we each bought it for $15 on Amazon is a steal, and a sad commentary on an overlooked but excellent game.

Such a lovely game. Somehow both tense and relaxing at the same time in quite a unique way. You can play it very strategic or go with the flow.

The theme is interesting, and this is the kind of optimization game that I should like. However, there are two things not done right.

- Aesthetically pleasing graphics, but not very functionable. The map is very small, the font choice makes it hard to see some of the details.
- The single biggest strike against the game: There are a lot of options, but really not so much, as you won't even consider some options as they are unconditionally worse than the others. I feel that the tracks can be balanced better. This is basically a fault in the design, a deadly one.

This is not a bad game, but it would need a great improvement to justify the deep learning curve and long playing time.

In this game based on Italy in the middle ages, players are merchants with  5 actions to do various things during their turn. Move, purchase cubes, advance on various tracks, increase knowledge and buy manuscripts. 

In the first 10 rounds, the first player to reach a certain region can claim a round bonus (money, knowledge). This is seeded randomly.

Players can also decide to upgrade from merchant to friar, and to cardinal. At the end, players vote with cubes to see if they can be pope and gain more VPs. 

It is an interesting game, but it does have a variable end length. This might sway the game to a person following a particular strategy. There are different tracks one can spend effort to advance on, and it is possible to get nothing. The game length is going to clock in a bit longer than what you are used to, so if you are out of the game, it could be a long wait. I've played once with 4 players, and could be talked into trying again, but I'm lukewarm on this one.

Lots of hard-to-remember rules and downtime in this action point allowance game, featuring Papini's signature profession changes, which provide much flavor. I wish there were more of an arc; as it is given the length and downtime, it's easy to get a bit checked out midway through. There are many strategies worth exploring in a future game; I'm chalking up the latency to first game thrashing in an attempt to compensate for lack of early-game strategy, as it is too late to switch strategies by mid-game. Rating will probably increase on a second play; don't expect much from your first unless you've studied and synthesized the rules.
-----
Liked it on a second play, maybe because it felt familiar, but not enough to increase the rating. At least we got to try out more coherent strategies!

If you have someone in your group who enjoys Caylus but complains that there's no theme to it, jump on this game.  Same-ish mechanics, same-ish multiple paths, same-ish position jockeying.  But much better theme.

There's some really fiddly rules about one of the paths that will confuse and frustrate first-players, and you will forget the banker-to-church rules at a critical moment in your first-play as well.  Push through it.

Affascinante gioco, anche se non immediato per via delle numerose regole. Permette ai giocatori di scegliere la propria strategia e intraprendere strade diverse, nell'arco della partita infatti i giocatori, inzialmente mercanti, potranno fare un percorso di conversione diventando dapprima frati per intraprendere la carrira ecclesiastica e poter diventare magari addirittura papi. La via del papato fornisce a fine partite diverso consenso (PV), non sottovalutate comunque l'opportunità di rimanese mercanti per approfittare di facili e abbondanti guadagni, specie se commerciati con l'oriente. Le fasi di gioco ricordano Siena, altro gioco di Papini, De Vulgari Eloquentia è ancor più articolato con tante opportunità offerte dal gioco che rendono le partite avvincinti e inizialmente anche un po' ostiche. Il tentativo di contestualizzare il gioco lo rendono molto appagante.

The Pope Game! I'm a dunce when it comes to comprehending the rules and intricacies of Euros but, for whatever reason, this game made so much sense to me! (Let that be a testament to me being a well-seasoned gamer with lots of meaty Euros under my belt before playing). And I really shouldn't have understood it well. There are blatant typos in the rulebook, the gameplay is non-intuitive and there are VERY SPECIFIC ways to gain points which make the game very hard to enjoy. However, the flow of the game is basic point-to-point movement and it's only in the specifics that the game loses it's footing; De Vulgari Eloquentia is a solid, fun Euro. The title is a mouthful, there are tracks that are extremely specific in ways of gaining victory points and the game could stand a couple more playtests. But! It's a great Euro with a unique theme and artwork. It would definitely benefit from a second edition to make it easier to pick and play though.

It's all about the VPs and nothing but the VPs. There are so many different ways to earn VPs you'll be falling over yourself collecting VPs. There are two main strategies, and with each strategy you’re trying to get your "VP to action" ratio as close to the optimal 1:1 as possible. If you get to around 80%, you should be in the running. 

With the "knowledge rush" strategy, the aim is to maximise the number of actions acquiring manuscripts (as manuscripts give a 1:1 ratio). You can only get 1 manuscript each turn, so the idea is to rush your knowledge acquisition asap, so you can spend 2, then 3, then 4 actions per turn acquiring VPs at a 1:1 ratio for the second half of the game.With this strategy, you tend to eschew money, become religious quite early on to earn knowledge from your friar selection, move each turn to the next adjacent "earn knowledge" space on the board. You aim to lead the pack in knowledge, getting to each level before the others.

With the "cube rush" strategy, the aim is to acquire cubes, which are close to a 1:1 ratio when you trade them in at game end (especially if you can deprive others of earning these end-of-game points). Here, you need lots of money, you want to be low in knowledge to get first (or second) play each turn to get first choice on the cubes. Once you have lots of cubes, near the end-game, you turn religious to get the high-end VPs from the friar or cardinal tiles, or become the pope. With your leftover actions, acquire as many lower-level manuscripts as you can to preserve that 1:1 ratio.

There’s many variations that lie between these two, and some of the charm of the game is exploring viable opportunistic strategies that the others are leaving you because of their single-minded focus on their strategy. There’s not strong competition between players doing dissimilar strategies, but two players doing the same thing can get messy, resulting in for example actions wasted on wanting to go first to pick up cubes first next turn, or to get a favourable manuscript in a needed colour.

On the criticism of some aspects:

a) The Orient track seems a waste. It doesn’t make sense to spend 6 turns in the first few turns to later on gradually earn up to $70 as you travel, when you can simply 7 actions on 7 different turns to earn $70 throughout the game if and as you need it? The latter gives way more flexibility and you don’t usually need that much extra money anyway.

b) The Bologna track requires 9 actions (including the cube) to get 10 knowledge (or 10 for 15 if you do it early).  That’s a lot of actions for no VPs. It’s really only useful if you’re doing a knowledge rush and you need those final knowledge points to get you to the level 8 spot. Still, that’s 13 (or 14) actions for 8 points, not a great ratio so it’s only desirable if you’ve run out of other things to do that give a better ratio and there’s no other way to get the knowledge you need.

c) I don’t mind the Riddle Of The Verona track if I can win it for 5 actions. That’s a 1:1 ratio. If you do it first and spend a whole turn doing it all in one go, that’s usually enough to dissuade anyone else from "probably wasting" 5 actions chasing and competing for it. Still, that results in another track that isn’t competed for.

d) The papal library tile track is another waste. Spending 1 action gets you either 2, 3 or 4 points. That’s a great ratio. Spending 4 actions probably gets you 3 or 4 points, a lower ratio. As a result, it doesn’t make sense to spend more than 1 action here, so it’s a another dead track.

I tend to just accept and / or ignore these and work towards the things I know are good ratio actions. But it’s a shame that the game hasn’t been tweaked to make these more viable as alternative use of actions. Once it’s understood that these are pretty much dead actions, the game does narrow in focus however, resulting in more competition for the better ratio actions and more "game" in later playings.

Re speed, early games are slow while everyone is trying to work out all of the above and put it into practice. Turns get faster though - I know what I want to do and what’s not worthwhile - so I bank on about 25-30 minutes per player.

All in all, it’s a VP hunt when you get down to it, but it is a decent game. The theme is different and there’s enough game there for occasional interested replay. It’s a shame that the overwhelming feeling is one of promises not kept - of wishing there were no dud elements, that the initial illusion of many useful options to use and explore became an ongoing reality. Of knowing it could have been better.

What an underrated game! Great theme, fast turns, variable setup. Like 'biblios' in theme, but an actual game. Name of game and theme of travelling merchants, friars, abbesses, cardinals, seeking knowledge, books and elections is obviously not appealing to a wide audience, hence its quick dive into delete bins everywhere. For a heavy Euro, the theme integration is one of the best. Glad to get a copy before it completely dosappeared.

Yes, this game is long, complex, and fiddly.  Yes, it has a truly bizarre theme.  However, it really excels if you like long-term planning, as you can see much of what's going to be available on upcoming turns in the game.  You need to move around the map-board to perform various actions, so the game rewards timing your moves right (and knowing when to use the turn order track) to make everything fall into place for you.  The actions of others sometimes can play a big role in your plans, though, and not just because they did what you wanted to do faster: their role (merchant, monk, cardinal) and the number of votes they have can affect your decision-making.

It appears to be just a random collection of mechanisms pasted together and thinly veneered with labels from a history book. Any semblance of a theme resides in the fevered imagination of the player. Downtime is long as players can only minimally prepare for their turns AND it features an unfortunate collection of mechanisms that may have a player going first one turn and last the next. The big target - becoming pope - is hopelessly undervalued. The author attempted a semi-random ending - which is a good thing as it prevents abnormal min-maxing on the final turn - then bungled it by signaling the end BEFORE allowing the players their last turn.

This game is unlike any other in my collection. 

Action Point Allowance with map movement, limited resources (in the form of support from various people) and an economy to manage. All the while gaining knowledge of the common Latin language. 

The game progresses along a different story arc for each player of the game. This is the most thematic Euro style, strategy, gamer's-game I have ever played. Much to explore.

The rules are a bit involved and have a number of exceptions (and some questions aren't clearly answered, even on BGG). The rule book doesn't help much and sometimes even confuses things. There are misprints on the game board. Even the screens are printed with incorrect (game breaking) information. 

GAME COMPANIES: PLEASE HIRE ME (CHEAPLY) AS A RULE BOOK AND COMPONENTS COPY EDITOR! 

The rule book is what stops this game from: 1)Being more successful and 2) Being rated a 10. Despite the lack of attention to detail in translation, printing and editing this is still a top tier game that will not leave my collection.

This is a game where you wander around italy as a merchant. At some point you can decide to become a friar, and at some point as a friar you can decide to become a cardinal, and if you are a cardinal, perhaps you can even win the election to be pope! At the end of the game it's points that matter. This game has a lot going for it, in terms of theme and ideas, but it's plagued with terrible graphic design and tiny text that contains partial, or even worse, mis-information about how the actions work and what they cost and do. It's sad to see what would be a good game become a frustrating mess like this. Maybe it will get another print run someday?

So, this game is the Siena idea but not as dry. Takes awhile to get very little accomplished. You can deffinitely have a strategy, and work towards it. Stays close to the theme, using abstract mechanics, I wasn't bored which is a step up from Siena's auctions. I was hoping the change in role would be more choices like Siena had with the Banker. In DvE it doesn't move to having that choice but in name only. But maybe adding that complexity would've been what dried out Siena.
Overall, an above average unique game.

Fiddly, complicated, inelegant, kitchen sink design.

Multiple paths to victory?  Well, no.  More like multiple paths to irrelevance.  

Why do red cubes cost 30 with their limited use?  Why are black cubes free, but worth more than yellows which cost money?    Why should you collect knowledge early when going last will mean you probably won't get the cubes or books you need?   Why is there a track that can only be advanced on on turns 2,6,10,11,12+?  Why is there are a track you can advance on when in the North?  Why is there a track to look at up to 4 scoring chips, that will run out before anyone gets there?  Why do you need to spend 6 action to get $10 extra as a merchant, when the only to win is give up your income?

This is a very bad Ameritrash game with a Euro theme.

This game offers planning ahead, plenty of interesting choices to the players and has a very original and convincing theme: The birth of the Italian language.  Ludicly speaking, is an action point kind of game, in a Kramer way, in which players have some points to spend on different actions, not a worker placement one like some people say, because there is no race among the players to get the few spaces available for each action. Very hard to win as a merchant.

If I was rating this solely on originality of theme, then it would be an automatic 10. As it happens it's also a very good game as well as having such an interesting theme. The title is an essay by Dante (I'm sure that's a first in Boardgaming history!) which translates as "On eloquence in the vernacular" and is about the attempt towards establishing a unified Italian Language. Interesting and enjoyable. Needs a good player aid (see the files section) otherwise new players will struggle to know what is going on, and how to evaluate their strategic options.

2013: Only one play so far, but really want to come back to it and play it again.  Amazing components and the gameplay design really makes me feel like I'm living out someone's life story.  The reference sheets PDF available here on Boardgamegeek is a must.  The rules are very exception-y and not always clear, but there's some gold to be found here, I think.

It's one of those games that requires some FAQ investigation and some player aid print outs before you will have the rules down solid.... but, once you have the rules ironed out, it's a very satisfying game! The theme (as dry as it may sound) really suits the game well. I've played it 6 times now and have enjoyed every game so far.

Kevés akció, nagyon sok lehetőség. Talán így lehetne egy mondatban a Dante művéről elnevezett játékot jellemezni. Igazi gamer's game, amiben a játékosok közös nyelvet alkotnak a játék során. 5 akció áll rendelkezésre minden körben és kb. 14 fajta lehetőség ezeket felhasználni. Ezek közül a legtöbb olyan, amire több akciót is lehetséges elhasználni. Így tényleg van min gondolkodni a játék során. Nagyon érdekes, hogy kereskedőként kezdenek a játékosok, később akár pappá, bíborossá, sőt pápává is válhatnak. Minden szerep különböző előnyökkel jár. De már egy játék is bebizonyította, hogy mindegyik szereppel van esély a győzelemre, így nagyon jó játéknak tartom.  Rettentő tematikus és teljesen nyelvfüggetlen. Egyedüli kifogás a kivitelezést érheti. A játéktáblán több hiba is van.

I want to like the game a lot more than I do, but the problem with it is that in the beginning you run your guy around on the board doing stuff that doesn't amount to a whole lot, and then when you get to the meat of the game the entire system devolves into a boring, luck filled, set collection game mixed with running cubes up various tracks for the sake of VPs scored in over-convoluted varieties.  The game grinds as you end up analyzing and min/maxing everything, because, it actually is important that you do.

All this leads to a huge amount of downtime.  There is absolutely nothing to do when it isn't your turn.  You can't really even plan much.

In the beginning, it's fun marching your little dude around, making tough choices in how you want to play, but even in the beginning you feel the weight of each other players' turn.  As the game switches over to the tracks and the set collection, your turns become less interesting so there isn't much to look forward to while you are waiting.

I only enjoyed this as much as I did because I was with people that I really liked. We just talked about music while we waited around for our turns.

I just love this game to death. The action selection is just so delicious, because there is so much to do - you can drool over all the possibilities. It is a very "open" game, i would say, as it is all up to you where to go and what to become (you can even become the pope!) This is a game for deep gamers, as the rules have a lot of "you can only do this then" and "you have to do this to do this" - but once you get the hang of it, there is something really, really special here. Very unique game - right up my alley.

1 play, 5er

The game reminds me of Siena, but cleaned up quite a bit (although I think I only played that once, years ago). Here, everyone starts out as a merchant in Italy during the middle ages. You can stay a merchant, or enter the religious life by becoming a friar (then possibly advancing to a Cardinal, Camerlengo, or Pope). There are a variety of options with varying costs, basically 1-5 action points (here, you use discs) you spend each turn. You go about visiting cities, gaining knowledge and/or money the first time you visit each city. You can get support from politicians and nobles (cubes), research at the Papal Library (for VP), etc. At the end of the game, players use their cubes to buy some (or a lot!) of VP. You get additional VP for the various things you've done during the game -- collecting manuscripts, advancing along various tracks, leftover cubes and money, etc. Most VP wins.

Fun game! It took us nearly 3 hours, but I'd expect things to be faster after the first play. In some ways it feels very thematic: traveling around, living life, studying to gain knowledge, paying your way into the higher ranks! But the game is supposed to be about the development of the common language in Italy, with players doing their parts in creating that language. That part of the theme is, for me, almost completely absent -- I just feel like I'm running around doing stuff to earn VP! Maybe if I knew more about the history here, it would me feel the theme more? Regardless, it was fun; may have to break the shrink on my copy of the game!

Didn't dislike the game. It has good ideas and a strong strategy feeling with the events occuring in different cities with the possibility of planning ahead. The translations seemed to be the key for victory and it's a pitty that they are so lucky driven IMO. 
The setup is hugelly annoying, rules are far too many and the playing complexity it's not that much. I got the feeling that you could take one or two things of the game and maybe it would become better.
Very dry with no theme feeling.

Comments on the rules

Scary Scary rules - not the best English and loads of them. As i read them i kept thinking - 'i don't ever want to have to teach this game'

Multiple actions on a players turn of which he can take 14 different Actions - some with different time/cost permutations. Lots of cubes. Loads of house keeping. Loads of exceptions to rules. Advancement of tracks (loads of them) , movement and actions on board (with a free move once in the game for the Stupor.....'. Role selection , role selection within role selection (which tile to take) - and a final VP role selection at the end

The theme  might mean something in Italy or to linguists but does not shine through the rule book, i kept focusing on what the cubes do.

Its invidious to make a judgement on a rule book - this game appears to be a labour of love for a interesting idea. However it appears to be over egging the Euro pudding - there might just be too much going on. Or it may play brilliantly or the game may just be to complex for me - however its on my 'try before buy' list'

Action Point allowances with a lot of options. Maybe too many options. Relatively learner-unfriendly presentation (although I liked the artwork, it did little to help you remember the many available actions; player aid cryptically focusing on scoring rather than actions). A lot of rules, with a lot of exceptions: can't decide whether this makes it 'meaty' or just 'confused'.

Weird theme. Had to get that out of the way. A very complex game, tough to get your mind around initially. Some beginners seem to treat knowledge as VPs. This might end up playing pretty easily, though. I'll need more plays to decide, but I suspect this is not a buy. It's pretty much a (probably over-complex) victory point generation game. I'm not seeing much advantage to the complexity.

Very nice game. The theme is blended with mechanics so well, and if you are born in Italy you can really appreciate the whole feeling of a game about the making of the Italian language and early literature.
And, even if you don't care about the theme, there is quite a good game in there, so it can be interesting for gamers too. Actually, it's maybe a little too complex for casual gamers.

This is a very lengthy, heavy euro about trading in the Mediterranean. Sounds pretty boring, but I had a pretty good time. The interesting aspect is that you start out as merchant and can make a lot of money. Then you can become a Friar and eventually a Cardinal, which both have their own benefits. At the end of the game, one of the Cardinals can before the Pope, which is worth a lot of points. The theme is pretty dry (mostly getting different colored cubes and things that are worth VPs), but I enjoyed the decision making. I experimented by becoming a Friar on the first turn and managed to win the game.

Played once in a 2-player simulation game to learn how it plays to be able to teach it to others. Wow, what a brain burner. Lots of difficult decisions to make and plenty of room for many paths to victory. Should have good replayability due to the cubes and the order of the event tiles. Probably best with more than 2 players as it is difficult to go through the manuscript tiles very quickly. Looking forward to trying this with other people.

[thing=75165][/thing] is a strategy game set in the Middle Ages, in Italy, as it is forming its language - the Vulgare - from the many dialect that existed in its regions. This theme may not be the most attractive for many players, but, for me, it is awesome: I really like the study of old languages is fascinating. Of course, [thing=75165][/thing] isn't a study per se, but the theme - however thin it is - is a plus for me. And, not only this, but the artwork has that medieval flavor - from the box, to the board and pieces.

Now, on to the mechanics: they are great. When I look at the player aid (which you can download [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/61723/dve-double-sided-player-aid-english]here[/url] and it is a must to play the game) I was a little afraid, since I couldn't make heads from tails - and usually, even when I haven't read the rules (like I did for this one), I can "view" how the game might work. This wasn't the case here. And when I started to listen to the explanation... there is just a plethora of options to chose from. But when the game actually started, its brilliance came into view: a dense, strategical game with several paths to victory. And also much less scary as I thought it could be - the flow is organic and things make sense.

The game, in a really brief summary, is: everyone starts as a merchant, with 5 actions to be used all in one turn, and you have a huge amount of choices:
- move (in land or in sea);
- use your small business (to get money);
- study the Salterio (to get knowledge);
- use the Pope's library;
- study the Riddle of Verona;
- use Messengers to acquire data (and, then, use it in Bologna in order to gain knowledge);
- study the Canticle of the Sun;
- study the dialect (by acquiring books written in such language);
- rest;
- acquire political, clerical, abbess and amanuensis influence;
- do deals and study in towns in order to gain money and knowledge;
- become a Friar in a Convent;
- become a Cardinal (only if you already is a Friar) in a Cathedral;
- use a Abbey to gain influence.

Not a small set of choices, right? And some of these actions can only be taken in specific places or in specific rounds. This requires a high level of planning in order to determine not only what you want to do, but also [u]when[/u], [u]where[/u] and also be the first in the place (as the Events are only avaiable for the first player to reach the place and use it) - adding a timming component to the strategy. Also, to study the dialects (acquiring books) requires that you travel through Italy, since you have to be in the region where the dialect is use to acquire a book written in the given dialect.

There are very few hidden information in the game - the order in which the books will appear and the health of the Pope (that marks the end of the game - the last round happens when the Pope dies, something that can happen, as soon as round 14 and as late as round 16).

All of this comes together to make a marvelous game. The best of this year among the euro-crowd, for sure. It is really satisfying to project that you need to be in Firenze, in round 9, with 3 actions to spare, with 45 ducati in order to acquire political and clerical influence, and being the first in the turn order - and you know this already in round 7. Then, by the time round 9 comes, you are able to do all you wanted.

However, [thing=75165][/thing] has some small flaws: the players shield are almost useless for the information part - it makes the game harder to understand, actually, so use the player aid I commented above. Also, the game could use a scoring board, though this isn't mandatory, as all the scoring happens in the end game - but, I think a handmade one may be a good addition to the game.

Anyhow, an awesome game.

RATING: 6.5
Got this because I liked Siena (same designer) and this is rated higher.

This is different. The "economy" and player interaction of Siena is nearly gone here. There is some crude, minor interaction among the classes, but mostly, player interaction is gone aside from the "taking something you wanted" sort.

DVE is annoying to learn but plays pretty quickly (else I would drop it to a 6 at best). It's possible for me to imagine playing it a number of times, trying to figure out the best strategies. With my single play I was learning and stumbling around a bit. It very much seems to be a puzzle to figure out. Though, due to the low randomness and limited resources, I think it may also be possible to play it in a chess-like, maybe AP-prone way. (Though, turn order is continually rearranged based on the "knowledge" track, or spending actions to get priority, which in practice makes it pretty tricky to foresee who will have first shot at doing what.)

A short explanation of this game is that there are numerous things you can do to work towards getting VPs, and many of them require you to be in certain locations (on an area-based map of medieval Italy) to use them. The availability of some options (location-specific events, and cube supplies) is scheduled many turns into the future, to potentially allow planning. Another game (like End of the Triumvirate) where the map reminds me of a complicated Rondel.

The "incidental" style of player interaction really kills my interest in the game, though. It's like a solitaire puzzle that won't "sit still" to be solved: The players are part of the game but it doesn't feel like you are playing with them.

I really want to like this more. I actually rather do like the core system - five actions per turn, each action can only be taken once, you can only use each city's benefit once - but everything else layered on top of that gums it up and, more importantly, makes it drag on forever. (Poor graphic design doesn't help - it's not easy to tell which track does what until you've played for a while, and the book/region colors are hard to distinguish.)

Given another round of development, this could have been a pretty good game.

A theme that's near and dear to me (collecting manuscripts!), there's enough variation here to give it some good heft, though it'll take a game to get all the rules straight. Once everything's in order, though, the game moves at a good clip.

Though the game rewards picking a strategy and sticking to it, it often isn't enough to specialize. To this end, there are a number of secondary scoring methods (The Riddle of Verona, The Canticle of the Sun) that absolutely can swing the game in favor of one player or another.

One of these days, I will win this game!

This rating may go up with more plays, as this is yet another one of those "nothing quite like it" games. My biggest concern is that I'm not convinced that the 2 major "paths to victory" are balanced. I think that the monk-cardinal-pope route is superior to taking the merchant-banker way. This won't stop me from trying however! It does take a few turns to get used to the flow of the game, as well as the specialized tracks, canticles, etc., but I find the game very absorbing. Another gem from Mario Papini.

RATING: 10
A fresh variation on action-point mechanism. The theme got me into the game, the game kept me there. It's not looking like things we play, there is almost zero-luck in the game (some variation at start-up, some for end-game trigger), so you can only blame yourself for bad play...

What I like the most is the early need for decisions that impact the full game. Do you pursue a knowledge startegy ? Do you become a friar ? Are you going for money, to be a pope, to stay poor ? So many things that will impact the game, that you have to do early, wothout a full understanding of how the game will unfold...

Interaction between players is low, but subtle. Honestly, a very good game, very solid, that will probably not appeal to all. To try. But if you are like me, you will love it.

EDIT: After quite a lot more plays, this is a great game. In fact, when you fully understand the core of game, the interaction between players is much stronger.The variety of possible approaches for victory is really nice, and there is a lot of freshness in the way the game challenges you. Really one of the most interesting games of 2010/2011 for now.

RATING: 7
Aw geeze, yet another game about the creation of a language? ;) Fun, action point game, where each turn you spend your 5 action points in your choice of many possible places - move around the map of Italy collecting knowledge and/or cash from the locations, earn cash, acquire knowledge, buy manuscripts, earn votes for upgrading yourself at the end of game, or advance on multiple tracks that earn points or other benefits. Each player has the choice of what route their character takes, whether they stay a businessman, or go the religious route, becoming a Friar, Cardinal, or perhaps even Pope. Actions are very limited, in that it often takes multiple action points to do just one thing, such as acquiring a level 4 manuscript takes 4 of your 5 action points. The winner is definitely the person who was most efficient. Interesting event system, in that the order is fixed, but where you start varies each game. So, one game is event 7,8,9,1..6 and the next is 2,3,4...1, etc. Events are face up and known, so you can plan to be in the proper city just as it happens. Enjoyable with 2 players, but I'm looking forward to trying it with 4, in order to get more interplay (merchants have to donate money to the religious players), and to see more use of the turn order track.

This is an absolute hidden treasure. The rulebook is a little clumsy, which is probably why this didn't make a bigger impact, but it really is a treat to play. In essence, this is the medieval Game of Life. Players all start out as merchants and compete to gather books of different colors, which represent manuscripts of different dialects to be absorbed and formed into a new written language for the commoners and business people of Italy. The game's twist is that money can be fairly scarce and player's performing poorly at merchanting can quit and join a monestary. At this point, there focus changes and they gain bonuses to finding and copying manuscripts, which really helps in the pursuit of the games Victory Points. The trade-off, is that you play the rest of the game on the edges of poverty, unable to travel far and depending on the kindness of others when you do. The others being the players who stayed in the merchant business, that now have to pay a Tithe to you every turn out of their profits.

As the game progresses toward it's finale, the merchants can ascend to titled prominence, the monks can become cardinals and eventually, one of the cardinals can even ascend to Pope. For such a brown and drab game, there is an absolute carnival of narrative hidden away in this strangely named game. You can probably get it for $5 dollars or so if you know where to look... and I would highly suggest you do before everyone else figures out they missed such a gem!

Pretty good game, but the artwork is bland beyond belief. Also the symbology isn't great and there's a lot of little rules that are easy to forget.

An interesting game that was fun(?) to play.  My first play (with 3p) took longer than it probably should have, and I would be willing to play again, but it might be a while until I am ready to play again.

This game is really great.   There are a lot of options, plenty of competition without folks ever getting shut down, and fast game play once you grok the rules. The iconography makes sense once you've played a bit, and there is a ton of strategy and tension for a super game night.

really like the theme, but have a couple of problems with it: a couple of dead tracks and just ok with 2p.  on the cusp of being traded away...but will decide after a few more plays with higher player count.

There are so many different tracks that it really takes a long time to teach. This is a worker placement game. Once you start play turns are quick. You can guess what others are collecting cubes for so you have a chance to change your plans. The board artwork is very pretty but graphically it is hard to see.

Overly long, underdeveloped and needlessly complex. you need to reference the rule book continuously while playing the first game even with an experienced teacher. Iconography was obtuse at best. Everything looks the same. It was not clear if there are winning strategies or just many different ways to collect victory points. Still the underlying game is very interesting. It left me wanting to explore different paths. With experienced players I can see this potentially being a very good game if there are no degenerate strategies. The problem will be finding that group of players willing to become experienced.

This is a very good game at heart, but the artwork is some of the least functional I have ever seen in a boardgame, with no exaggeration.  It is nearly impossible to tell the different icons apart, and given the degree to which you rely on iconography to tell you the function of each mechanic, that is a major weakness.  Furthermore, the map on the board is even worse than the icons, with symbols that are too small and blend in to the backgrounds, which confounds the problem.  There is just very, very little to distinguish different functions/places/icons in the game, so I would give the art a 1, it is atrocious and I can't believe that Z-man allowed this to go to press as is.  Not necessarily ugly, but it actively makes the game harder to play.

Enough about that, the gameplay itself is very intricate, this is quite a heavy game.  There are many ways to get VPs, but it is a bit of a VP salad.  Also, if you do not enjoy games with very little interaction, you will not like this.  It verges heavily on multi-player solitaire.  There is almost no chance to screw your neighbors' plans, and indeed there can be a large amount of downtime if you play with the AP prone.  You will have nothing to do while your neighbors play out their 5 actions and you wait for your turn.  So for these reasons, I think the game is not really a true WP, you can always choose whatever action you like, regardless of what your opponents do (indeed, your opponents will not even be playing the game while you are playing).

The game is also extremely hard to teach (exacerbated by the bad art), because there are so many moving parts.  But, if you put the effort in, there is a good game there.  It is really all about long-range planning and efficiency.  There are so many paths here, but you cannot jump from one to one willy-nilly.  If you can't choose the few that will work towards your goals, then you will lose.  If that sort of a thing appeals to you, you will love this game.

I have enjoyed this game more than my 6.5 rating may declare, I just don't see me wanting to play it as much in the future. My two plays have been interesting and had different flavors, but I'm not sure how much more there is to see here.

That said, I'm glad I bought this. I'm sure it will come out at least one more time in the years to come, which would put it at ~18 hours [2 hours per game x3 players x3 games] of enjoyment for $23.

JUEGAZO. Asi, en mayusculas. Un juego poco conocido y poco difundido con una tematica tan peculiar como la conversion del latin en Italia de lengua culta a lengua comun. Visualmente atractivo, mecanicas muy bien encajadas y varias formas de ganar hacen un gran juego. 
Fue un capricho de mi mujer que le llamo la atencion en el stand de unas Jornadas de juegos y la verdad es que acerto de pleno

Played the prototype and thought it was fantastic.  What you'd expect from a Mario Papini game - extremely thematic, lots of strategy and medium complexity.  Can't wait to see the final product. :)

Once you wade through the rules and actually play this game (or have someone teach it to you neatly, so you can dive in), it has much to offer!  [b]So[/b] many paths to follow, granting so much replay value.  My mind races, thinking of how the mechanisms implement the theme, in some ways with perspicuous neatness; other mechanisms make me want to learn more about the topic!

After one play:  Seems like something I'd really enjoy from time to time, but not a weekly thing.  Sort of a brain burner with the potential for huge AP.  I really liked the play through.  Will have to try again with more players as first go was with only 3.

This game is slow to reveal all its subtleties. Plays surprisingly quick too if players avoid AP. (Did 3-player in just over an hour!) Love the story aspect and that you get to do a fair number of things that are different from any other game. One of a kind.

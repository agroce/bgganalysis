Interesting idea, owned it for four years but never got my copy to the table once, I think it's because it probably only appeals to the 18xx crowd, but why spend time playing this stripped down version when you can play the real deal? If you are going for 18xx, might as well go all out. I guess it has a niche for an introductory 18xx game, but once you've transitioned to full blown 18xx you'll never go back to this. 

That being said, the components are nice, the rules are clean, and the game is playable and enjoyable.

while not in anyway a bad game. a proper 18xx game is a better use of your time (though will take much longer)


the theme on this game actually makes it a little harder to comprehend than the regular train/companies theme.

RATING: 8
Complex (when compared to the heavy economic Euro-games) and light (when compared to traditional 18XX games), regardless of its origins or ancestry, this is a neat game. The board is beautiful. The components are tactile. The decisions are meaningful, and the rules fairly intuitive. It takes a bit of learning, and it's rather unforgiving, but it feels like a serious game. All in all, a great package.

This is a good introduction to the 18XX series. Nations don't generally change hands and there is a risk the game can not progress but this plays quickly and is only a couple of hours for an 18XX game. Probably better with 4 or 5 players.

18xx light has almost become synonamous with fun light, yes it simplifies the system but it also simplifies the interaction and the depth leaving a shell of a game that seems like theres only a limited number of ways to play it and the game will expand similarly each time. being a Double O design it works better than others i've played but I'd rather play a heavy euro in the same time frame or if more time available a full 18xx.

Looks like it has great potential for sneaking under the radar of friends who have no interest in train games.

1st play: This was my introduction to the 18xx series.  There's a lot going on but the ruleset is really not so complex.  I think the game would have been helped by themeing it as CEOs of ancient shipping companies, and using standard 18xx terminology (shares, operating rounds, dividends) would have made it easier to understand.  I do like the art and the production, and I think that standard 18xx production values might hold it back.  I like the shared economic interest of this game - the player who won ended up not owning any companies for the latter third of the game, but he picked companies to own shares in and invested his money properly.  In the game we played, there were very few hostile takeovers, and companies mostly were profitable over the course of the game.  I'm not sure if that would be better or worse, but we did have a couple of attempts to take over companies that might make it fun to try in future plays.

2nd play: Upon a 2nd play, I definitely understand what people mean by calling this an introductory to 18xx.  This time, we weren't tripped up by the terminology and just called things by their train names (CEO, Shares, Dividends, etc).  It's an interesting game that feels a little over-simplified.  I can tell that there's some interesting timing stuff around when to upgrade trains, how to build out routes, and how to manipulate stocks, but because the game simplifies a lot of that, you don't quite get to do all the things.  I enjoyed my second play, but feel like I'd like to either dive into a fuller 18xx experience, or turn away.  Great productions for this type of game tho.

After one play with two players: The game is enjoyable and manages to give some of the feel of 18xx in a supposedly shorter playing time.  Our game ran over three hours, so I'm not so sure of the claim that the game is much shorter, but as it was a two-player game we did each have three companies to run, which added to the playing time.

The key to creating a such a short 18xx game seems to be losing both the stock market and the route-building.  The stock market is linear and generally unexciting.  The route-building has been considerably altered.  Gone are track tiles: the players instead move a survey ship that can drop off tokens.  Companies run by snaking a path from their home station through as many of these tokens as they can.  This avoids much of the intricacies of route-building found in other 18xx games, but something else also seems to be lost: companies that are opened late both have fewer good places to lay tokens and have had less time to lay them.  I've only played once, but on the surface it seems like the early companies will have better income potential than the late ones.

The game is entertaining, but I worry about the strategic depth.  It seems like the best strategy is to par a first company low and buy as many shares as possible.  A second company is parred very high so that it can flip shares into the market for cash when the 4's and 6's come out.  This cash then buys ships for the first company, which uses it's well-developed network to make a lot of money.

After more than half dozen games I'm still not sure whether this game is balanced or maybe one of the privates is too strong compared to others (as it seems to me) which combined with the fact that they are bought not auctioned would make this game broken. Still, as I have not confirmed this sufficiently yet I'm giving this game the benefit of the doubt. In short: assuming it's well playtested and balanced this is a nice variation on 18xx, though I miss dumps.

as a 18xx-fan, and after reading the rules, the game seemed promising, but my first play was a bi of a disappointment. I thought that the decision of choosing merchants would be hard, but it wasn't. When the first 4-train is bought, then you can decide a second time. At that time, the first companies (governments, excuse me) were already so strong that nobody was interested in new nations, so everybody bought the original merchants from the stock. Game was very early decised and nobody tried a second nation.

I may be biased but I don't think the train stock ownership theme translates to Ancient Greece as well. For one the frequent conflicts between these city states is not simulated making the theme too superficial for me. Also it seemed harder to mess with other players compared to say Baltimore & Ohio. So while the game is good it doesn't appeal to me as much as other train games, although I still prefer over any 18xx!

RATING: 7.5
A unique 18xx title that is masquerading as a euro game. The “retheme” from railroads to Mediterranean sailing makes little to no sense and actually makes it more challenging to explain the mechanics. I think this is a solid introduction to the world of 18xx. It may not be the best for this purpose but it is a good choice because it looks attractive on the table, plays well from 2+ player, plays relatively short, and introduces many concepts seen in 18xx. I enjoyed the idea that a company is started by not only setting a stock price, but also deciding how many shares to issue. This is a neat decision point. I also thought the way that trading posts replace track laying is interesting and scales well over the game. In particular I think this game has a nice feeling ship rush (i.e. train rush) that pushes the game along (through automatic discarding of certain ships) and puts pressure on players. Finally, it is quite a nice design element to have a limited number of “potentials” that will either represent shares or trading posts. Some aspects that I didn’t really enjoy are the very simplified 1D stock market, the fact that players can sell and then rebuy the same stock in the same stock round, and the fact that a country that withholds only earns a fixed amount based on game phase. This last one in particular bugged me as this earning has nothing to do with the revenue of the country and feels too gamey and unrealistic. It makes things simpler, but I would have preferred to see the company withhold their actual earnings (and hve this affect stock price). I guess you can’t have it all when you are trying to simplify and the designers felt that making this decision point a bit easier was the right way to go. They may be right. 

While this isn’t a perfect title by any means, I actually think it is a very unique and enjoyable game. This is a great litmus test to see if you have any interest in stepping up to a bit more complex level in this game system (with something like 1846) or if these games just aren’t for you. It is beautifully produced, fairly easy to understand, and quick to play. I don’t see one group playing this game 10+ times because they will probably move on from it, but it is a valuable part of a game collection because there aren’t many options to introduce 18xx style games in a reasonable length game night. Glad I added it to the collection.

First play and I'm very enthusiastic about this game. The fixed number of rounds makes sure your play will likely stay under three hours, especially given familiarity. It has enough of the familiar 18XX elements to scratch that itch, and the theme is well executed turning a Train Game into a "Galley Game." You must try not to think too hard about the distinction between money (drachma) and "prestige" which suddenly become equivalent at game end - it works for the purposes of victory determination. I'm glad to have a copy and I'm sure it will get on the table regularly.

Inital rating, need to play it more. Light end of the 18xx scale. Avoid it if you love the track building element and/or the cut-throat market manipulation of some 18xx titles.

I think this is the only game I've written 2 reviews of.  An excellent cross of 18XX and Winsome.  It plays relatively quickly (about 2 hours) and has some tough decisions in it (i..e, start high/few shares vs start low/ many shares where more shares means less track to lay).  Haven't played it for a while but would be happy to pull it out again.

I have mixed feelings about Poseidon, which I have only played once. I liked the game as the challenge it posed, because no other game I have ever tried resembles its mechanics (maybe Imperial?). On the other hand, I am not sure how much fun I would derive from further plays. It really felt like an exercise, not a game. Despite being advertised as a watered-down 18XX, this game is far from easy. Each choice has many implications and you need at least one game before you can devise a coherent strategy. Excellent components, pasted-on theme (other players kept talking about companies, trains, etc. during the game).

RATING: 6
Tough one to rate. It's probably actually of more interest to the die-hard 18xxers than to newbies, despite the short rules, because it mostly revolves around train acquisition rather than route-building or share-picking. Get two companies, do the spreadsheeting required to make sure the right money ends up at the right place at the right time. Those financial planning activies really are not that interesting to me, and they can take a lot of time to do - the game rewards lots of forward analysis and planning, so be prepared for some downtime and a much longer playtime than advertiesed.

Anyway, not my thing, although 18xx fans may well like it. I'll stick to 1825 and 1853.
---
The caveat: my one game got a rule badly wrong - we were allowing a company to get the "withholding" revenue even if it didn't have a ship. Oops. Still ...

The good: Like 1825 and 1853, Poseidon is "about" running well-managed companies, picking good stocks, winning the competition for prime routes, and staying ahead of the obsolescence curve. It's lacking any of 1830's train-fiddling, having companies bail each other out, and stock fiddles. There is some, yes, just as there is in 1825 and 1853, but if you need to start a second company primarily for the purpose of bailing out your first, that's a sign of a weak position, not what the game wants you to do. The game wants you to run your companies and manage your finances well. For me, this is the appealing part of 18xx.

The questionable: The rules aren't great, and mistakes are easy to make. The game does revolve heavily around the "train rush" where you need to time your acquisition of ships as stuff goes obsolete. This timing game is not intuitive. The stock market is not as well calibrated as 1825; without the ability to do multiple jumps, and with stock not falling back even if you withhold, and with frequently limited shares on offer, the range of outcomes on the market feels constrained. Finally, our game went long, at 4 hours; we had a slow player, but still. 1825 is reliably 2.5; this is where Poseidon wants to be. The route building is simple and pretty abstract, which is fine, but in order for that sacrifice to be worth it the game has to come in shorter.

I'll give Poseidon another chance, but it just has to come in at 2.5 hours or less.

A different take on the 18XX concept.
The nature of the map and the starting places for the nations (companies) suggest that it might not have the variety of replay-ability that most 18XXs have.  Still, a fun game but not one to be played too often to avoid it going 'stale'.

RATING: 6
:sugar: :( :) :) :D :) After two games, both played with five players overall, both played with tables full of players with no (or almost no) 18xx experience, Poseidon looks like a winner, and my rating is likely to be a coin flip between 7 and 8. It's probably better to think of this as an entirely new type of game borrowing significant elements from the 18xx family rather than another 18xx game that happens to be shorter and less complicated. The tradeoff between being capital-starved and retaining lots of discs to build your routes and going buck-wild on issuing shares but potentially letting your fellow players leech off your hard work is there, and really interesting. Route-building is pretty easy to do -- you just drop a disc in a space that your exploration fleet touched -- but it does raise some interesting questions. There is a very real question as to whether these questions would remain interesting in the long run, but so far so good. Lots of temptations to extract money from the kingdom's coffers and into your own pocket, which is usally smart but not always.

Better player aids seem like a must. I am unhappy with the state of the rules, which, as I said previously, seem to sacrifice clarity in favor of brevity. Once you get it, the game's a snap but it's a bit of a technical climb to get to that point, and I'm a relative expert compared to the middleweight Euro-gamers this game appears to be aimed towards.

The stock market is 1D but not entirely linear, thank the gods. Prices appreciate slowly, then pick up steam in the middle of the table, then slow down again, which would seem to have some bearing on when you want to withhold vs. pay dividends. The higher you can par a kingdom, the better.

The phyiscal presentation is fine, apart from the lack of player aids. I always play with poker chips (it saves time) but this is the rare game I feel a little bad about this -- the paper money in this game is absolutely lovely!

Criticisms:

1 - The manual, already dealt with above.
2 - The lack of a good sequence of play player aid. Also discussed above, and easily fixable -- someone's probably already made one.
3 - The theme; the switch from corporations issuing stock and building railroads to kingdoms issuing merchant licenses and establishing trading posts, while totally cosmetic, is distracting as hell to me and makes it hard for me to explain, since I keep verbally switching from the game's preferred nomenclature to 18xx corporate-speak. My problem more than the game's, I suppose.
4 - Very little in the way of stock shenanigans, which is a loss I feel as an 1830 fan. Makes the game more pleasant and less confrontational but at what cost?
5 - Probably most importantly, the route-building aspect of the game is pretty non-interactive. Everyone seems to be in their own silos and apart from locking people out of trading posts, the on-board play is not especially rich in decision points. Points 4 and 5 above make it hard to use Poseidon as a stepping stone to 1830 and 1830-derived games.

I would recommend this as a next step for Power Grid/Chicago Express fans who want a little change of pace. You lose the auction angle but PG has no stock-holding element at all and CE's is pretty primitive (though brilliant). I would recommend this to 18xx players who are jonesing for something they can do on a weeknight. For players who are looking for a first step into the 'xx? Mmmmmmaybe. I would say you're better off going whole hog and getting 1830 while it's available at a reasonable price. It's tougher to get into and definitely a longer game, but you'll treasure it forever.

RATING: 7
Is it an 18xx game?  Yes, I think so...but in a very simplified way. The upside of this is much higher accessibility to the mainstream Euro crowd, and shorter play time.

The downside is that much of what makes other 18xx titles charming is removed or abstracted to the point of feeling absent (like the track-laying). 

The stock market is very flat and very stagnant. Its not really possible to move kingship ownership except in rare circumstances. But there are enough levers available to do some interesting things.

If you are a big 18xx fan, you'll probably get bored with it...although if you're not sure whether you want to commit to a longer game (like 1830) this may be a decent way to get a rough feel for it.

I prefer Steam Over Holland for a learning style game, but they have some pretty strong similarities.

The best 'simple' 18xx I have played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Poseidon reminds me a lot of Steam Over Holland, an earlier attempt to make a lighter 18XX game for the masses. Poseidon's main speed-up gimmick, aside from the turn limit, is that instead of track tiles, players use discs (well, honestly this is just shades of everything Winsome has been doing since 2007, but anyway...) which speeds up track placement considerably.

The actual interesting hook is the fact that the track discs double as stock, and the person who opens the company has the freedom to choose how many start out as stocks, and can later add more to the market as the ships (trains) are purchased. This is an interesting wrinkle, and can create some tough decisions, as having more financing from the stocks has to be weighed against having a greater potential track network, particularly given the availability of diesel ships for the late game.

That's all the good, now, the bad. Like SoH, I think the turn limit stunts the game a lot. As in that game, the length, combined with the flaccid stock market make it less lucrative to flip companies, as giving up a round or two of stock profits seems to be very, very bad. Sure, the money can be re-invested in another company, but it takes a few turns to build things back up again, and everyone else's stock is spiraling up while you're idling along. This is further exacerbated by the fluffy stock market, where shares only go down one step period regardless of how many are sold, and only when the director sells. The result seems to be that players hold onto shares more than usual, and the game feels much more static as a result.

I do like some of the ideas here, the disc track with variable limits per space combined with discs doubling as stock are all very interesting and worth further exploration. The game that these interesting ideas are being used for, however, is not one that I think will have a lot of legs, and I hope that the designers take this idea and turn it into a full, 6-7 hour length 18XX game instead, as I think there is real potential here for a very solid new mix of 18XX and Winsome cube rails, easily something in a high 8-9 range. The existing game is just too small, too limited, and too friendly though. Give me some knives to dice my opponents up with!

A dive into the 18XX sub-universe of boardgames, where companies run boats instead of trains.

Obviously, this game has all the pros and cons of the sub gender: All information at sight, all the merit for the player who best evaluates the value of each route and each company, as the best timming to buy or sell shares but, at the same time, major punishment to whom does not know the game well (upgrade technology between turn, for instance), much AP, as enormous amount of calculations to do and some 3 or 4 hours to spend. The replayability is also somewhat low, as different games tend to follow, more or less, the same paths as previous ones.

Yes, it's a simplified version of 18xx and set in 1800 B.C. Ships replace trains, outposts replace cities and there is no stock, only merchants. The simplified stock market makes it easy to teach and the path building is not as complex. I enjoyed my play and want to explore the game further.

[5 Nov 2017] 8.0 (7 plays)
Bumping the rating up after making it half way through the 10x10 challenge with this game. As the game advertises, it's an 18xx game at its heart with both stock and operating phases, which I really do enjoy. The difficulty with this title comes from the mismatch between running a public train company and starting a country. Stocks are replaced by merchants, there are kings, etc. This makes it a little bit of a challenge sometimes mapping rules to actions in the game.

The stock market in the title is quite friendly. Stocks only drop when a king sells a merchant. There is no downside if a country decides in the operating round to not send out the fleet. Anytime the fleet does go out, the stock price is bumped a single level. Countries must pay dividends when the fleet goes out too, making it less interesting decision after sending the fleet out. After phase 2 and 3, countries are able to add more merchants to the pool and is one of the key ways to raise money for the country.

The operating rounds are a bit different as well. The game uses an exploration ship (survey party) that determines where a country can setup a trading post. These roughly map to routes the fleet will run but fleets can run anywhere making it quicker when determining routes. Boats in the fleet add their ranges together, which doesn't necessarily make sense. 

The game lasts a fixed number of rounds, making it very predictable when trying to determine if we can fit it in a night. Some of the simplifications also speed up turns enough to make the game a nice school night game.

[15 Dec 2017] - 7.5 (11 plays)
Finished up the 10x10 challenge with this game. I like the ideas in the game and how it attempts to bring parts of the 18xx game system into a form that can be played in a fixed amount of time and doesn't incur tons of AP from players. The game and the board does feel like it provides guides on the players to encourage you to start the same countries and explore in the same areas of the board. The real challenge came from learning how to manipulate the train rush (ship rush) and thus force opponents to use potentials as merchants and raise cash instead of being able to expand their trading posts. The slight drop in the rating is because it does get samey between plays.

I've never really played a stock market game of this complexity before and so at times it was difficult to know if I was making sensible decisions or not.  However having played this once with 2 other new players I can say that I very much enjoyed it.  The game worked well, made sense and we didn't have any problems with the rules.  I can see why this is recommended as an 18XX intro game as 3 of us with no experience in the genre played this without any problems.  It was a solid win for me too, which was nice.  I'd really like to see how this plays with 4 or 5 players though; I suspect it would be very different to how it played with 3 (where we never made it out of the 2nd phase).

If your interested in 18xx, just get 1830, not this, its a far more interesting game, and not as hard to learn as some folks make out.

The rule book for this game is concise, but clearly not aimed at introducing new folks to the concepts of 18xx. It reads like an instruction manual or recipe book. If it wants to attract new players to 18xx (such as me) it could really do with some more examples and possible some strategic hints, such as what knid of prestige you should  set up a new kingdom at. The theme is very very obviously a paste up.

It is however quite simple once you've figured it out.

Turns out I dont have aspergers. Even if it's not balanced, I loved it, thinking about it afterwards.

Traded.

Having played 1830, I realize the western map is not worth a lot, and all the ways this game is unbalanced. And how I wasn't controlling the game when I thought I was. 

And that I wouldn't want to play this game again knowing that the best way to win is to have very specific inside information about the best routes on the map.

One learning play but I can't say I was enticed to enter the world of 18XX by it or to want to revisit it.

I see the attraction of that but find it a joyless and tension-less experience.

This game does a remarkably good job of being like an 18XX game while also being relatively quick and simple.  However, it's not simpler or shorter than 1846, and I'd prefer to play the latter game 100 times out of 100.

A time-boxed 18xx game.  The few differences makes this game interesting enough.  Not much stock manipulation, this is more a tactical route creation variant.

RATING: 5
It's billed as an entry-level 18xx game, yet I don't think it prepares for a "real" 18xx in a useful way because almost all the interesting decision points of the system have been either blunted or taken out completely. There is no track-building to speak of and stock manipulation is not possible. You cannot dump companies and rarely have to reach into your own pocket to purchase the mandatory ship.

As such, explaining an 18xx game might take a bit less time after having played Poseidon because some of the underlying mechanics and the basic ideas behind them are similar but the gameplay is still so different that one of the smaller and simpler 18xx games would be a much better choice if you want to get a taste of the 18xx world. That would almost certainly be less processional and rigid, too.

Let's be honest, Poseidon is a watered-down 18XX game. That said, I like it more than most heavy Euro games. Most of the 18XX flavor is there, but it's toned down and quite accessible to non-18XX players. At the moment Poseidon stands as a great option for a short-length 18XX experience, but I'll see how that holds up once I get 1846 into my grubby hands.

RATING: 5
Preliminary rating after one game. It sets out what it attempts to do: An 18xx experience that's easy to grasp and playable in a fraction of the time. But it's every much a Eurofied version of 18xx, as direct nastiness using capitalism as a club seems hard to achieve. The danger of bankruptcy also seems remote. Very much a portfolio management and run-a-good-company game.

Still, seems good for what it is, and rating may climb.

Update: After four games, I feel it's just not that thrilling. The default play is to run one company well and use another to withhold and supply cheap boats. As such, it's kind of processional. 2p is actually a bit more fun, as juggling three companies poses a good challenge.

One play makes me want to try it again, but not right away. I'm going to let this one rest a little (like it hadn't already, sitting unplayed on the shelf).

Not for light gamers or those adverse to double digit multiplication.

Pro: Useful for purposes of introducing 18XX system to players unfamiliar with that series. Good job of simplifying the complexity down while keeping the conceptual core of the system and much of the planning aspects.

Con: Have not played enough to know the replayability of the game, but interesting so far. The fixed turn limit helps keep the play time shorter but definitely allows for artificial actions based on knowing the end of game which are bad habits for real 18XX games.

RATING: 7.5
Good, streamlines introduction to 18xx-style games.  Playing time is pretty short with at most 2 1/2 hours for 5 players.  The reduced playing time comes from two factors: 

1. The game is played over a fixed number of turns.  

2. Track handling is drastically simplified as there are no track tiles anymore but simply markers which you put on the board which speed up both track laying as well as the calculation of the companies revenue.

RATING: 6
My first foray into the realm of 18xx. I can see why the system has its fans. It is incredibly brutal and punishing of mistakes. As for Poseidon, the theme and presentation are fine, but I would have certainly found learning easier with a more straightforward theme, like trains. It seems like the Poseidon ability is very powerful--It didn't let me win, but it allowed me to compete even with hapless play. I can see where that might annoy the more hardcore 18xx following.

====
6 years later, I had to relearn this. It seems like the rules could have been better written. I've had two "learning" games of this, and both were pretty rough. I want to like the game, but the frustration of learning it impedes enjoyment. I ought to try it again soon, or else one from the 18xx proper.

After one play this has presented as an interesting game. I am experienced in 18xx and this has a number of those elements strongly represeneted as you would expect from the designers with their pedigree.
I think the use of the same token as a merchant, and a share works nicely and the boat rush is there. I presume obselete boats just sink, I wonder if the crew get a warning!

18xx for beginners, with some interest for old hands. Cautiously recommended, but with an important proviso: the players must collectively 'push the game', ensuring that all the nations start and, as a consequence, the higher trains (sorry, ships) come out. If everyone plays conservatively, sticking to one nation and nothing beyond a 5 ship ever gets purchased then the game stalls horribly and becomes very dull. Four of the nations (Larissa, Athens, Sparta & Ambrakia) seem a lot stronger than the others and their routes are so well 'signposted' that scripted route building is inevitable. I also wouldn't want to go last in a 5 player game. The simplicity on offer here gives this an appeal outside of the normal 18xx crowd, so I expect I'll be playing this regularly, but I've come to regard the search for an 'introductory' 18xx as a complete fool's errand. Designers try to create a pain-free induction to 18xx, but by stripping out the nastiness they're removing everything that makes the system so appealing.

RATING: 7
A solid exercise in monetary optimization with some interesting wrinkles.  Even having no other experience with 18XX, though, I can tell there is something missing.  The game feels a little too...mechanical, with a lot of going through fairly obvious motions in order to get to the interesting part (the merchant phase), which is itself a fairly dry exercise in guessing which companies (sorry, [i]kingdoms[/i]) will give you the best return.  With no meaningful way to affect the stock prices, the game seemed to suffer from Rich Get Richer Syndrome (though I've been told this is not always the case).  It took me about 3/4 of the game to see how all the pieces fit together (again, no previous experience with 18XX) so my rating will probably go up with repeated plays.  If anything, it makes me more interested in trying 1830 since the underlying system seems solid and I would welcome some nastiness to liven things up a bit.

RATING: 5
Wow, this is basically the member of 18xx family.  It's very very similar to one of the simplest 18xx designs: 18AL.  It's just slightly simpler, shorter and a bit less cutthroat.

Before getting to know 18AL I had the following opinion on Poseidon as a game on its own:

'Rather straightforward decisions besides ships management.

This is a decent design, but:
- the game is too long for what it offers - I'd prefer the box not to lie (saying about up to 2h of playing time). In reality it's closer to the usual length of lighter 18xx games (4-5h).
- the game is static in a sense that the ownership of the nations doesn't practically change during the game.  That's bad for the share-holding game...'.

In short - not a good recommendation for 18xx series... :>

Unfortunately (and unexpectedly!) 18AL turned out to be even worse experience - being longer and more complex didn't really bring anything new/interesting compared to Poseidon.  
Being forced to play I'd choose Poseidon as less tedious game providing similar experience within shorter timeframe.

But generally after trying 18AL I'll be staying clear of 18xx games (see my comments on 18AL).

Sold.

RATING: 7
18xx for Eurogamers, as advertised. I've since started dabbling in real 18xx games so I can see all the places where Poseidon isn't nearly so interesting: the dull stock market, the boring board. The interesting decisions about how many merchants to issue versus how many trading posts to keep don't quite make up for those flaws.

On the other hand, it's an 18xx-type game that I can get to the table, so it gets points for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tentative rating after one play.  I purchased Poseidon as a gentle step into the realm of 18XX games.  However, in an ironic twist of fate, I played 1889 within a week of purchasing Poseidon and thus played an 18XX title before playing Poseidon.

I like 1889 better than Poseidon which is a solid game in its own right.  However, the market in Poseidon seems too tame.  Stock manipulation which was a component of 1889 is almost non-existent in Poseidon.  Also, we never had a company/nation switch hands in our play of Poseidon.  The way the market works in Poseidon it seems much more difficult and much more unlikely that nations will switch kings during the course of the game.

Finally, the group found the theming confusing.  I realize the designer was trying to make an easier and more euro friendly game, with the change in theme.  However, the theming seemed to make things more confusing.  I think it would be easier to understand and learn with a "train" theme than with its current theme.

RATING: 6.75
It's listed as an 18XX game but it's even less 18XX like than Baltimore & Ohio.  There are no track (or equiv since it's set on the water) to build/place, there isn't even any cost to expanding your network (at least B&O you have to pay terrain costs).

It was interesting and I'd play again but I don't think it has a lot of re-playability as the map is fixed, there isn't a lot (even with 5 players) of contention for route locations, etc.

Our game was I believe very close (scores from about 3,200 to 3,400) though I've never played a true 18XX game (only semi-18xx, ie. 18EZ and B&O and now this one).  The winner actually never brought up/ran a company (or greek city-state in this case) but instead just invested and obviously kept re-investing the dividends he received.  He was also not only a regular 18XX player but had played this one several times before.  2nd place player was also 18XX experienced.

I liked the tension between number of merchants to capitalize and number of tokens available for board placement. I found the privates simple to understand but interesting enough to be worth a thought.

I did not like the stock market. I never like linear stock markets so this does not surprise me, but I found Poseidon's especially problematic. Specifically I thought the market in Poseidon was even deader than the one in 1861. Due to a quirk of the priority card I was in position to start the last company of the game. By simply parring it one block higher than the most valuable new company and three blocks higher than the most valuable existing company, I was able to secure first position for the rest of the game, which is a huge edge given that a ship is burned off the ship stack after each of the last four merchant (stock) rounds.

The other aspect I didn't care for was the priority card; I'm aware that in some of the new "streamlined" 18xx titles it's common to just circulate priority one player to the left every SR, and I can see how that simplifies things for new players but I don't like it.

A worthwhile title and I can see where it might find a niche - personally I prefer a more complex 18xx experience but in and of itself Poseidon is a fine game.

I liked this as an intro to 18XX games. I had only played one other and it was difficult to understand. In Poseidon the map design seemed to limit the options in building a route so most of the game play was in working with the stock market. Shares are issued in a country to give it money. You then buy some shares from your cash. Countries buy ships that give a route length and are used to calculate income based on the length of the route. The share markers are also used to build routes so it is necessary to balance between route size and raising money for the country to buy ships. As you take in income the market price increases. Also shares can be bought in other countries. That last part seemed critical, but I haven't figured out the best timing to buy those shares.

An interesting twist on the 18xx system settled in ancient Greece that can be reasonably played in less than three hours even with newbies to 18xx. While it shares many features of the system, it's too different in a few core instances to serve as an introductory game. In first place, the route building is more similar to Winsome titles than anything else. Also, you really have to mess up to go bankrupt in the ship rush as the city states (railroads) can usually issue some more titles to refinance themselves making Poseidon a very tame 18xx variant. It's fine as a meaty economic game option on weeknights but time available a full-fledged 18xx will give more satisfaction.

Definitely a 18xx-lite-lite.  It has its own interesting situations and challenges, and overall, I'd rather play a regular 18xx than this one.  For a quick 18xx-like experience, though, this one isn't bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The best try I've seen so far at a faster 18xx-like game that includes all the ingredients: stock market with buying and selling, companies and players as separate entities, play on a map deciding how profitable the companies are, and companies as potential liabilities due to technological obsolesence.

The stock market action is lame to say the least, but there's some room for playing tricks with starting high share price / low share count companies just at the right moments to take advantage of the extra share issuing that happens on the 4 and the 6. The fairly low share limits also mean that even though getting extra capital to afford a permanent train is pretty easy, a badly run company will be a liability just due to taking up a minimum of 3 valuable share slots.

Compared to the closest competitor Baltimore & Ohio, the map action and the train (err... ship) buying decision seem a lot more interesting in Poseidon. At least in the first game the shares vs. tokens tradeoffs were non-obvious too, which is good.

Based on just one play I can't yet say whether this game will really have legs of it's own, or whether it's just going to be used once in a blue moon as a 18xx intro.

Knowing next to nothing about 18xx games in general, this seems to be the right thing for me. I like not having to worry about the whole track building part of the game.  That said, this still might be a little too long to see much play, but I did enjoy the one play so far.

But ultimately it failed around here.  If we want 18xx, this is dismissed, and if we want to play shorter games, we choose something else.

Played once, 5p.  I liked this much more than I expected, given my caution towards the 18xx genera.  This is a more streamlined 18xx with (it seemed) less screwage.  I would play again given enough time - it is not a quick game (though MUCH quicker than some 18xx games).

So I decided to enter the 18XX universe. Up to now, I'm really loving it - I know it's not a bona fide 18XX, but it captures its elements resulting in something great. After three plays I already think it is a great design, and it really achieves the goal of making people interested in 18XX games. One of the games took about four hours and a half, but that was with players who never played the game (except for me), rules explanation was included, people were not optimizing money flow and number of players was the maximum (5). In more favorable conditions I expect this to be perfectly playable in 2h-2h30 (which we already achieved when playing with three people who already knew the rules).

[b]Update[/b]: After 10 plays and also knowing other "real" 18XXs (I own 1846 and also love it), I still think this is an outstanding game. My last play was with only two players and, surprisingly, it worked well.

I wrote a review about it here: [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1544990/why-poseidon-works-or-how-did-i-successfully-enter]Why Poseidon Works or how did I successfully enter the 18XX universe[/url]

RATING: 8
The perfect game to play 18xx with people who do not like 18xx... :) The secret is the round limit, the game ends after a fix number of rounds, so it can be played in a moderate time. Even considered separately from the 18xx-Concept it is a nice econocmic strategy game with interesting own ideas and less hardness without cutting to much. The rules are not such complex, Power Grid-Level I would say. The only thing I would say could have made it a better game for everybody who likes econcmic strategy games, is that for a 18xx-game it looks nice, but compared to other modern games the design is quite functional. Plays also well with 2 Players.

This game does provide an 18xx experience in about 2 hours.  I do wonder if it will have longer term replayability.  I have played about 4 times now.  Newer players seem to struggle with the more advanced strategies.  I do like the obsolecese of the ships which is a common item in most 18xx games.

This is an excellent introduction to the 18xx genre. I've only played once so far but I can see that it's a "proper" 18xx and that with more familiarity that it'll play in well under 3 hours. The single game that I've played was three player and now I'm definitely keen to see what happens with more players because it will affect the number of Kingdoms in play and the rate at which the Phases advance. The big thing to figure out is how to decide the initial King set up - number of Merchants and initial Privilege level.

I was hoping this would ease me into the reputedly wonderful world of 18xx games.  It didn't.  It still took 3 hours for my group to play this game, and there was a great deal of dry "mathy" calculating going on around the table. Further, it just felt weird buying shares of interests in various Greek city states as they developed trading routes in the Aegean Sea.  I asked, "what are supposed to be international bankers of the ancient world?" I was booed down by the other players, "don't pay attention to the theme," they responded.  If my game is going to have a theme, I like it when the theme matches the mechanics.

two 2-player games. First game was a nice intro but we played it wrong (used eastern part of board, didn't remove the 3-5-7 card), so gameplay didn't really move. Second game, did so and the game was moving the whole time. Both times, my partner (different in both) really enjoyed. Need to play it more to see if it's samey but right now fully enjoying it. First game took 5 hours, second took 3. I imagine gameplay time will go down with more experience and the 2 hour mark on the box isn't too far off. 

Will play it with more players, hopefully soon! I'm interested to see what happens when buying into other player's companies is more than just an option (as it is with 2), but something that's a necessity

*edit Sept 7, 2012* Did end up playing it with three. Was a better game but oh so thinky. A few things I felt kept the stars from aligning. Didn't like the limited number of operational rounds. I love economic games but there are others in my collection that scratch that itch better, with less brainburn. Actually, I like brainburn but only when the game feels to me like it needs it. I didn't play this enough to see for sure but the game didn't seem to me to offer enough to explore the possibility

i got this to teach new players 18xx, but it's not fun and would probably turn a lot of people away from them. doesn't have the best parts of 18xx, it just has initial static "track" placement and the train rush parts. the using merchants as stock or routes was pretty cool though
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I don't think I'll ever be an epic 18xx player. The commitment of time and brainshare is just too much for me. Poseidon gives that feel, and allows the employment of many of the strategies, without the commitment. Our first game took significantly longer than the 2h boxtime but I feel that would come down with repeated plays. The simplified route building is quite sufficient for me and is simpler and faster to plan. The inability to dump nations on hapless investors will disappoint 18xx devotees but appeals to my less mean side. I like it and look forward to more plays.

Still, I hold a fool's hope to play Poseidon one day.

My first 18xx game. Took some getting used to (I think the fact that it's *not* about train companies actually makes it harder to wrap your head around). The stock market aspect felt a bit watered down (or so I imagine - like I said, I haven't played another 18xx yet). For all its complexity, it felt like there wasn't that much strategy. Maybe it needs repeat plays.

18xx with ships.  If your favorite part of 18xx is laying track to build a lucrative route or buying and selling stock to manipulate the stock market, you might want to stay away from Poseidon.

But if you want to introduce your friends to some of the basic principles of 18xx in a 2 hour game, Poseidon might be a good choice.

The actual game is superb with plenty of excitement which is rare in a share based economic game and as such this would rate a 9 on my scale. However the scoring and dividend calculations are so incredibly fiddly and difficult to see with playing pieces covering up information on the board that it slows the game to a crawl! Your actions are completed quickly only to drag through the money calculations! 
If the intention was to design an introductory game to the 18XX series then why not design a smooth end to end experience. I rate this only 6.5 due to this design failure.
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY.

Rules explanation was long, although once we started playing, things fell into place.  For whatever reason this game seems very bland to me.  Might be the artwork, which is close to non existent.  Personally I'd rather play Chicago express, or better yet Imperial.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While looking for suitable entry games for the 18xx series, Poseidon was frequently mentioned. Not only is the playing time shorter but the historical theme is also more appealing to me. The aspect of not "owning" a nation but rather buying and selling shares creates an interesting gameplay where you have to decide which nation that will give the highest current return. However, there are restrictions in buying and selling that makes it difficult to take over or plunder a nation. Thus, the game is more about optimizing the route-building and ship upgrades of the nations you're leading just like if you were owning them. That's also interesting but I had expected a more robber-like gameplay.

Update: Sold because I see no reason to play Poseidon when you can play 1830.

An 18xx game based on a non-train theme, that is, trading in Ancient Greece. Some say Poseidon is a great introduction to 18xx (also due to its unique theme), while others disagree, because certain 18xx elements are missing.

From description:
[i]Two to five players act as leaders of different peoples and command them to explore, send out fleets, build trading posts, and generate the highest possible profit. Poseidon contains most of the basics of 18xx games and due to the relatively short running time of two hours is as suitable for 18xx-newbies who want to explore this wonderful world as it is for experienced train gamers.

The 18xx basics included are:
1) Instead of running a corporation, players control a country/people
2) The goal of the game is personal wealth, the wealthiest player at game end is the winner
3) Players create trade routes similar to railway lines in 18xx games
4) Trains are replaced with common modes of transportation at the time (i.e. ships) with varying types
5) 18xx type stations are replaced with trading posts[/i]

This is a good game and a nice introduction to 18xx! But for those whom are used to all original 18xx terms, this game becomes a bit confusing. And, for those whom are used to the more cutthroat version of 18xx, this game doesn't have much teeth!

RATING: 7
Feels like a watered down 18xx. There is limited interaction because you can't trash shares or dump companies (or merchants/kingdoms/whatever - the terminology is confusing).

If anything this is more of an intro to the 1829 branch than the 1830 branch. The stock market is very mild. Withholding $ is better than it normally is because you don't lose stock value. It is relatively easy to put more money into companies because there are capitalisation options when the 2s rust (rot?) and then again when the 3s rust.

Each stock turn the smallest train is scrapped (presumably to prevent logjams when no-one buys). I think this takes something away from the game, as does the fixed number of turns - I prefer organic game endings controlled by players.

The components are very good. I didn't think I'd like having wooden stubs for shares, but they work better than paper shares because they are very clear and visible (and easy to handle). 

Conclusion: I'd rather play Indonesia or 18AL

Update Sep 2012:
Poseidon has been fired by 18Scan. 18Scan is only marginally longer (20-30 mins?) and is much much better.

RATING: 7
A pretty bared-back-to-the-bone stock market game. You invest in shares in a company, and if you're the owner, you get to expand its operations on the board - each space with a trading post will generate revenue each turn for each share owned. That's if you have ships with enough range to reach those trading posts. As ships get bought, ships with more range become available, and older ships eventually become obsolete, meaning companies need to shore up their coffers and continue to invest in better ships to continue generating decent revenue. So choosing which companies to invest in means determining which companies (or nations in this game) have a good ship investment strategy in place and can continue to pay high dividends. There's some cunning things you can do in terms of moving ships between companies to keep them solvent and going, and some cruel things can happen if obsolesence happens unexpectedly fast. Apart from that, the game is money in, money out, money in, money out for 2 hours, being wary and watchful about which stocks are about to come a cropper and which are about to bloom. Then, money in, money out. An accountant's dream game. I can't comment on this game in relation to other 18xx games as they're too long and repetitious for me to want to play (and there's some sense of that here as well), but at 2 hours this is enough to scratch any itch I have in the 18xx direction. I like that there's little incentive in this version to undertake stock market shenanigans and crash the market, making it move a "wise investment" game than a "screw you" type game, but understand that this may be a negative for the more dedicated 18xx'ers out there.

RATING: 8
A nice intro to 18XX for those who have never played and great for a shorter play if you do not want to embark on some of the longer 18XX games. However in this version, there are no trains, you have ships that you use to explore and instead of shares you have influence on nations. There is less blocking and the turns are much more straight forward since the track laying is replace with a simple ship movement and token placing. But with the possibility to control more then one nation and trading items between them, there is still a lot to think about. One thing I miss was being able to dump a company and dropping its shares significantly. This mechanic is much less painful as the share only drops when the current majority owner sells and always only by one space.

RATING: 4
A curiosity. The designers went to a lot of trouble to put an improbable ancient history theme on an 18xx.  The result isn't very successful.  The theme isn't really the problem (although it seems silly to me), it is the rules for the stock market that make it so lame.  The stock market has been made so friendly and nice that the whole point of 18xx is gone.

I actually like the track-laying part of the game a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the abstracted track laying. Worked ok with two, but there isn't much room for stock shenanigans and you can't dump companies, making it nicer but a bit duller than early plays of, say B&O.  We played pretty conservatively, so I look forward to seeing if this opens up a bit.

RATING: 8.6
Played it three times now and I must say that it is a wonderful game. The game length is amazingly short for a game with a 18xx engine. No problem at all in playing this game under two hours. Highly recommended both to players who are curious about the 18xx genre of games as it is the perfect stepping stone and players well aversed in the 18xx plethoria of games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2nd 18xx-based game I played after Baltimore & Ohio. Plus in comparison with B&O is the reduced playing time and it's also easier to play. 

Minus for me is the limit of bying just one share in the merchant round at a time (there is almost no risk of a take-over, so why not put all the available extra shares on the market when you get the opportunity?). If you have enough money you MUST start an other nation/company as you can never gain as much money from that one share as from starting a nation that gives you at least 3 shares of it. For that I like the stock-mechanics from B&O more then that of Poseidon.

Just observed a 4-player after finishing playing 1830. A bit of 18xx-lite that I'm not sure I really need. This is much in vein of 1829 Mainline, '18yy'. I'd rather play other 18xx in that each modify from a common baseline whereas the 18yy are significantly different.

An excellent game that is a light version of 18xx with some aspects similar to Chicago Express.  (This is actually a lighter and faster to play 'light 18xx' than Baltimore and Ohio.)

There are loads of choices of how to play at virtually every point of play.  And having to balance out the length of a shipping route with the shares in issue is just one of the decisions to be made.  It strongly feels like an 18xx game, but is much faster to play.  However, allow around 6 hours for your first 1 or 2 games.

It is an intense gaming experience, so it is not for anyone looking for a light euro type game or a short play game.

RATING: 4
May 21, 2011: This is tough to rate. As a light 18xx game, I'd rather play 18AL. Although Poseidon has a lot of lots of clever mechanisms to reduce game duration and complexity, they unfortunately reduce player interaction.

For example, instead of track tiles, it uses tokens similar to Baltimore & Ohio and newer Winsome Games titles. Track laying in Poseidon is a bit more interesting because tokens do not have to be contiguous. Still, it isn't as interesting as 18xx games. With tokens, it's much easier to build around opponents or know that it's impossible to break through much earlier.

Personally, my favourite 18xx games (1841 and 1856) involve the manipulation of corporation finances and stock market values. This, to me, is the main source of conflict in 18xx games. Poseidon restricts players severely (compared to other 18xx titles) in how they can finance their kingdoms/corporations. Consequently. this game is about running a corporation properly, not running it to the ground to make money -- which might make Poseidon a misleading introduction to the 18xx system, and might be suited for solely Euro game fans (although I believe this is too complex for the typical Euro game fan).

If this game cam be played in under two hours (compared to the four hours my first game with five players) then my rating might go up.

Played 2 learning games and was deeply impressed. I can see how people can grow out of this game (and into longer 18xx games) and rating this game low as a result, but what they seem to forget is how good the game can be for people growing INTO something like this. 

It's possible you may find it dry. But if you're motivated to play something mathy and stock market focused I think you're going to enjoy this.

I don't know enough about 18xx games to be a judge, but it feels to me that this may be lacking in oomph to be much of an introduction to the genre - that you may as well play an 18xx inspired but not derived game (eg Steam, Chicago Express) or the real thing... but maybe this is the real thing, I don't know. Very nice components though.

It's a good game in its own right, but I'd rather be playing the eerily similar Imperial or Imperial 2030. Poseidon deals with the stock market in a simple fashion. It gets the job done. The movement and placement of trading posts is also simple and has some interesting trade offs depending upon whether you're going first with a high share price, or last with a low share price, or something in between. The game is also very fiddly with the paper money flowing back and forth, which reaches some fairly ridiculous heights. It's all entertaining and honestly simple to play. It's quite decent.

Now, if you want to ramp the whole thing up a notch and be a faceless shareholder in nations where you can push each other around, simplifying the whole shebang with a lovely rondel, then play Imperial. Poseidon is the streamlined version of 18xx games as Imperial is a rondel fed streamlined 18xx with some meat left on the bones.

18XX light game in the same vein as [i]Baltimore & Ohio[/i] and with very similar mechanics and weight, but this time with an Ancient Greece setting and with sea trade routes instead of trains.  Probably [i]Baltimore & Ohio[/i] is more engaging, but the better components of [i]Poseidon[/i] makes the choice between them a hard one. It could be longer than it should.

Poseidon is great for introducing the 18xx system but after playing heavier titles I found myself wanting more.
 
I see it getting more plays as it is short.

Easy to learn and play, but it will probably take a few games to learn how to play well. Much simpler and shorter than 1830, the only other 18xx title that I have played. I definitely liked 1830 better, but due to 1830's length and my main opponents' reluctance to engage in overly long games, Poseidon is much more likely to hit the table in the future.

Sin haber jugado previamente ningún 18XX, me pareció un gran juego de gestión económica, con ese punto de originalidad que le da el hecho de que no eres una compañía en particular.

De reglas sencillas, es ese tipo de juegos donde la complejidad está en cómo ganar, y que la estrategia depende totalmente de con quién estés jugando.

En su contra, decir que la partida, a 3 jugadores, se nos hizo un pelín larga. La verdad es que me quedaron ganar de repetir partida, recomendable.

Interested to try, though after listening to Ryan's review the 18xx mechanics seem to make much less sense here than with an actual train setting (example: instead of buying/selling shares in companies, you're now buying/selling people? WTH?). Also it just seems like removing the track-laying component would remove one of the "funner" parts of 18xx gaming. I'd be curious to see how it compares to 18AL as an "intro" experience.

Love the look, mechanics and the theme of the game.

I want to make it more for new companies to use existing trade routes when the enter the game late 

I love both the theme, looks and mechanics of this game. 

My number one concern compared to 1830, that is one of my other favorites, is that you can't use trade routes that are already explored by other nations. 

My playtested variant: 

When calculating revenue each nation is allowed to use up to half their trading ships range to visit other nation's trading post. When you use another nation's trading post simply subtract 1 of the value of each post.

This rule change make it much more viable to invest in a new nation a bit into the game. They can just buy a bigger ship and after only 2-3 rounds of exploration be a big player.

This makes for more fun and interesting game. In the old game it is always a non decision to invest in old nations that pays the most revenue. Never in an up and coming nation.

1 play, 3er

Well, it's a shorter 18xx variant but it still took us over 3 hours (new to everyone). I'd like to try it again, just because I'd play it differently next time. I do like the simplified track play, and the built-in game time limit (fixed number of rounds). Also cool: the way discs can be used as track or stock -- up to the players (so company/country expansion limited by capital raised by issueing shares). And the ability to crash someone else's stock seems much more limited than I recall from my previous forays into 18xx -- which is a GOOD thing for me! Many of these mechanics came from earlier Winsome titles, and work pretty well to speed up the game compared to most 18xx variants.

Unfortunately, the game just wasn't particularly compelling! The whole time we played, I (and Sarah, it turned out) were thinking "meh"!

RATING: N/A
A light 18xx with a few good things but also some bad. The limited number of rounds work pretty well in some groups I have to say that I don't dislike it. I like to optimize strategies in terms of time. Steam Over Holland also have that.
The major novelty in the game, to me at least, is the way players start kingdoms. I like the decision of putting bonds in the market, getting at least half of them but many bonds mean fewer merchants to expand your "railroad".
The market is very dull and obvious. Don't like it. It doesn't have anything really different or likable. Injecting capital in a company (kingdom) is not easy and it's pretty obvious to me that that's the key of the game - if a player manages to get loads of bonds from one kingdom and still find a way to supply that kingdom, half of the way is done (this is actually no secret in any 18xx game :)).
I also find the unchanging policy very dull. I like to think that if I get to start one kingdom I sure have to deal with it for the rest of the game as a responsibility but the thing is that this is often what players really want so there's no in fact any sense of responsible risk taking on that.
Still a nice 18xx system kind of game, with nice components and simple rules.

Simplified 18XX with ancient Greek nations instead of companies. The game runs a fixed number of rounds, and instead of track, each nation's exploration ship can establish trading posts; instead of independent trains, multiple merchant ships add up to a range for a single fleet.

The ship (train) rush is important as ever, with usual parameters: 4s rust (rot?) 2s etc.

Perhaps the most interesting twist is that each nation has a pool of 18-22 "potentials" which can be used as [i]either[/i] shares or trading posts. Issuing more shares therefore implies a shorter maximum route length. Somewhat complicating matters is that routes don't have a total value which is evenly divided between shares, they have a per-share value which is multiplied. A company with more shares sold will therefore distribute more revenue for the same route.

Unfortunately the stock market is extremely dull. Nations only ever lose prestige if the king sells shares (other shareholders have no effect) and dumping is impossible (the new majority shareholder is allowed to leave the minority government in charge). I.e., it's a "run good companies" game concerned with capital management and timing.

Despite those limitations, it's still a good game and does capture more of an 18XX feel than expected. The question is whether it's shorter enough to justify over a shorter "real" 18XX.

I've never played an 18xx title, so I can't see Poseidon in that context. To me, it felt akin to Age of Steam or Indonesia, but with fewer interesting decisions. My single play (with 5 players) stalled a bit before early ships became obsolete.

RATING: 6.5
By far the best and more streamlined implementation of an 18XX I've played.

The theme is more enjoyable than trains, and the lack of set tracks really makes it more interesting.

The only problem I have with the game is something that I have with all 18XX games, the lack of randomness and hidden information, which can cause complete analysis paralysis. If you're playing this, make sure to set a time limit on moves -- as our first game went to more than 4 hours.

Besides that, I think until a MORE streamlined version of an 18XX comes out, this is the best bet!

Introduction to the 18xx system set in ancient Greece. Instead of running railway companies players are in control of shipping companies and aim to develop trade routes across the Mediterranean. Everything is simplified from a standard 18xx game and the stock aspect of the game is streamlined greatly. Far more emphasis is instead put on the routes and locations your ships run to and this is where the majority of important decisions in the game lie. This is a very good entry point to an 18xx game and as far as achieving its gateway objective it's largely a success. I don't however understand the decision to place the game in the ancient world as managing shares in shipping companies of the time feels really unthematic. It would have been far better to have kept the original railway theme.

The 18xx genre has a lot to offer it seems. If one considers Poseidon 'just another economic game' I'm certain it would be rated higher than it is with the 18xx label on the box front.

Played with essentially two 18xx newbies and one relative newbie, we seemed to somehow break the game; we were reluctant to buy larger ships early on and so the early and mid-game stalled badly as no-one could expand.

The premise is relatively interesting, but games that have to be played 'a certain way' don't interest me too much, generally. I'd be willing to give it another shot, but I'm far from wowed.

The rules need some cleaning. There is a lot of going on here. Components are excellent. Love and hate situation. There maybe a very good game here.
Update after many more games: This is the best introductory game in the 18XX series. Components are great with very clean graphics. The rules could have been written better, but you will find all the answers here at BGG. The game is great. Still it is missing the ability to sink a city/corporation. But then it would not have been an introductory game to the 18XX series. This is a great game. Go and get your copy now!

If I'm gonna play an 18xx I'm to the point where I want the screw factor

I imagine people who find accounting fun will enjoy the game, so not me. The rules are convoluted, the design is completely unhelpful, and you're pretty much doing the same linear algebra over and over and over. The theme is also completely random. The stock market mechanic is the only marginally interesting thing about it.

Great at capturing some of the feel of an 18xx in a small time frame, but I wish either it was meaner or there were more strategic route-building options. As it is, there just isn't enough for me there. Maybe a variant or expansion would add just a little more meat or blood.

The only game I've played that uses the 18XX system, Poseidon seems to share the things that make people like the 18XX system.  Thematically, this makes little sense.  Buying stocks in classical Greek city states wasn't an option, nor were they profit sharing enterprises that saw huge leaps and bounds in shipbuilding.  The theme feels as pasted on as anything I've seen.  The core mechanics are sound, and timing and acquisition and valuation is tight.  The bits are also great.  It's a beautiful game, but it's puzzlingly mismatched with its theme.

An ok game, but I think I'd rather play something like Chicago Express or Steel Driver for a similar feel without the headaches of calculating all the share payouts.

Also, while I can now see what an 18xx game looks like, this one just doesn't seem interesting enough to play very often.

I'd probably play 18xx if it didn't take so darn long  . . .

Based on one 4 player game. With my kids. 

Which is saying quite a bit for the game, in that it is quick enough, and relatively simple enough that they can play it effectively. Still, it does feel a bit too constricted. I need to think more about the proper number of merchants to create for a new nation, and what their prestige value should be, based on game conditions.

But we had fun, and finished in a reasonable time, and my 13 year old beat us all handily.

There are some constrains that limit your possible actions in this game that I wish were present. For instance, you must buy special cards (minor companies), and the fact that much of the stock is unavailable limits the ability to take over a company from another player.

That said, there is a decent game here, but we will likely play with bidding for the special cards in future, with the option to withhold cash instead of getting them as well.

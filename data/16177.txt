LOVE this game.  Fiddly to set up, but really fun to play.  Accept the randomness, and have fun with it.

RATING: N/A
Very interesting gameplay mechanics.  I'll echo some of the other's thoguhts in that the levels can be hard to read and the AP can be a problem.  Though after the first couple of cards played it did become easier to play.

no chance to plan.
you can watch, what tiles the opponents take, but you have to remember it. except this reason, you are absolutely not interested in the game, till it is not your turn again.
it is hard to recognize, at which level the cells are.

RATING: 7
A very clever set-collecting game with simultaneous action selection, but ordered action taking. Fun, and light, but still engaging.

RATING: 8
Rating is average of game for kids vs game for adults.

For children I'd rate it a 9 or 10, adults a 6 or 7.

Some luck over which cards you get (although a house rule can fix that), some memory element over what things get covered as you shift tiles around. All in all, a fun 'filler' level game - but could be painful if you have someone who wants to think too long.

RATING: 6
It's a really curious game, based on an interesting gimmick. Problem is: the board is not easy to read because of the different heights of the tiles, plus the luck factor plays a too much heavy part on the game. Planning is almost impossible because of the game structure, so your moves basically turns out like "Ok, let's see what can I take...". Could become boring soon.

A friend of mine showed this to me and I loved it.  I can't believe this was never picked up in English.

RATING: 5
Decent game of applying tetris-like patterns to a grid full of treasures in an attempt to pick up the best loot.  Some interesting play in getting the treasures to fit into your hand full of patterns, but nothing earth shattering.

RATING: 6
OK family game. Simple rules, gameplay sometimes a bit slow. Plays all right with three, might be better with more player (with three you are not very limited with what tiles to take).

RATING: 7
Not the most strategic game in the world, but it is fun, and has some unique gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game with some strategic elements to it.  Two small complaints: I find it difficult to tell which level tiles are on, so I am constantly checking them and then this gives away the area that I am considering.  Not a major problem, but still it is a little annoying.  The other complaint is that it is a beast to set-up, especially if tiles get mixed enroute to the games session.

A pretty good set collecting game.  A little prone to analysis paralysis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels a bit tactical, since you really can't plan ahead much.  But given that, the game presents a fun little puzzle to figure out your best options on a given dig.  I shovel it.

RATING: 8
This game is seriously more fun than I had first expected. I can be quite tricky digging up some of the more complexer patterns. Very good balance between luck and tactics.

RATING: 7.5
Wow, this game was a lot better, than I expected. It looks great and the tiles are nice and thick, but most of all it's a lot of fun to play.

Player compete to dig up treasure, but along the way they will also excounter will magical items, to help them on their dig, curses which will lose you money, but having the most at the end will score you points and scrolls, which you need a complete set of to score points at the end of the game.

Players take turn playing cards with Tetris like patterns on them, which allow you to dig in that pattern, so long as all the tiles are on the same level, but you can pay to slide other tiles out of the way and also use your collected magical items, to help you bend the rules of the game, to help you out.

Really an excellent game and I haven't played anything quite like it. I'd highly recommend checking this one out. Though it can be a pain to track down in the USA. Definitely worth it.

RATING: 8
Wonderful game, but not a sense of exploration, except in an abstract sense.  Very enjoyable other than the tile height challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
interesting set collection game with spatial relations elements and some 3D aspects to it.  a little problem with AP.  a big problem for me was that in puzzling out your move, players would move pieces around, uncovering some others.  Since new information was exposed, players ended up having to keep the tiles where they were moved and have to pay for them.  this really detracted from the game for me.

RATING: 7
A nice family game and a great 2-player game. Most of my plays have been 2-player only and I guess it loses any tactics when played with 4 or 5. May still work good with 3 anyway.

It´s also fast and unique, you really can´t go wrong with this one, if you are looking for a 2-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played 2-player (Indiana Jones Edition) - guess shouldn't play more then 3 as downtime would kill the game totally then.

What disturbed me most was the difficulty to instantly tell whether there are now 1, 2... tiles stacked in a box and for a game where the level height is critical this IS critical. 

Still some nice ideas therein.

RATING: 5
The only reason I rate this one so low was that it was difficult to plan ahead and it was really hard to determine if tiles were on the same level or not.  Which can be quite harsh.  Great idea though, I just didn't think it was all that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light brain-burner of the puzzle type. Best played with two or three players. Too chaotic with more players as chances are high that your intended move is not possible anymore when you play a card with a high number. In these cases, it's just luck if you find anything useful or have to pay big time.

Play instead: Tash-Kalar
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not my kind of game - planning is pointless because the board completely changes from one person's turn to the next. As a result there is a lot of downtime and the game is mostly about resolving individual puzzles without much strategy.

Different than anything else I've seen, you're trying grab powerful tiles that form strange shapes matching the strange shapes in your hand. The theme is fantastic.

RATING: 6
Surprisingly good. A very easy to learn and offers enough decisions to do. The hardest part here is to recognize different levels, which is a little minus for the gameplay. Otherwise... as I said... surprisingly good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More strategy than meets the eye. I had high hopes and was not let down. Oddly, the patterns on the cards resemble the same of those in Blokus. This one's unique and fun. 

Update: After another play this one moved from a 6 to a 7. Alot more here than even met my eye after inital play.

RATING: 5
Very cool, but in the end I didn't actually like it that much. Very nice components, though the levels of the stacks are often a bit difficult to read, which is crucial to gameplay. There's also a fair amount of downtime with minimal if any ability to plan ahead. I feel like something's there, but I'm not quite sure.

I don´t think that this is a good one. You can plan nearly nothing and if you got high numbers you might loose the game anyway

RATING: 6.5
Indiana Jones version.  Theme is a good fit, but execution in rebranding could have been better (e.g. Only difference between the curse and treasure tiles is in the image - nothing different in the background or numerical value as in the original game).  Haven't played a game quite like this - interesting mechanics - but prone to AP.

Plan to put some kind of markers on the 2-deep fields in next play as it can be a bit tough to differentiate levels visually.

RATING: 5
Interesting concept, but (at least with five) not enough there to really grip me.  My rating may go up if I ever try it with three.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The play of my turns was actually just fine, but the game was excruciatingly slow for two reasons: first, the game's decisions are very prone to analysis paralysis to begin with; second, you choose which cards to play at the very beginning of the turn...after the first one or two players go, the board has changed so much that your original card play is meaningless.  There's no way to plan your move even one move in advance.

Interesting ideas, but barely average game.

It's got set collection, pattern matching, and puzzle solving, all wrapped up in an archaeology theme. What's not to like?

RATING: 7.5
König Salomons Schatzkammer -- Played once; three-player.  What grand components!  The multitude of ways it may be possible to excavate make analysis paralysis a likely problem, but if players agree to avoid over-calculating, the game plays quickly.  I was pleased with this game all around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
A different type of game unlike any in my collection so for this reason I held on to it. Your archeological objectives are card driven (in numerical order). Kind of a cross between a 3-D puzzle and a tile set collection-ish? Tiles are stacked in 36 piles and become depleted as you dig, creating various levels throughout the board. The rub is that the patterns/objectives on the cards generally have to be mined on the same level so your digs will be thwarted at times as the topography changes throughout the game. Also, tiles will have different values, effects or curses so this must also be taken into consideration before you dig. A unique German game, you can find my English translation of the rules under the File Section of the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The best strategy here is to hope your card that you played gives you the right combo when your turn comes around.  Entertaining enough, but without any real substance.  Somewhat engaging when shuffling tiles around. Cute and diversionary.

The scoring will remind you of Knizia set-collecting, but the acquisition of tiles by "digging" for them is a novel twist and makes for some good fun.

Too much downtime for what it is: a relatively chaotic set collection game.  Perhaps with fewer players (I've played it twice with five players each time) or with players who aren't prone to anaylsis paralysis I might have enjoyed it a little more.  The bits are lovely and the idea is clever but it was just too long and it didn't really grab me.

Strange spatial placement game. You must excavate based on a card that you play, and need to figure out where the excavation pattern will work best.

EDIT: lowered a bit the rating for the problems listed last time. Anyways, good with kids but not simple, but to help them a bit the first time

Very nice components, ok. This is probably the best part.
Nice theme, somehow, but in the end it feels quite abstract.

The real problems are:
 - too long setup time
 - complete and utter analysis paralysis
 - if you are the last one digging, what you are left with has often nothing to do with what you were planning
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
High luck. Hard to recognize the stack levels. Not much possibile to plan ahead.

The Rose King, or The War of the Roses as it is know in Yucata, is a straightforward and simple abstract game taking place at the tactical plateau. The five cards you have in your hand keep the planning horizon near leaving very little room for big strategies. This has its pros and cons. 

A definite pro is that the individual turns play quite fast since you cannot solve the game down to the very end. There is enough freedom in movement to further reduce the possibility of explicitly solving everything. Moreover, random card draws help creating new situations every turn asking the players to adapt. On the negative side, there are really no strategic elements to the game. You just play the situation at hand trying to make the most out of it.

There is a fair amount of luck involved in the card draw so you should not take the game too seriously. Just play and see if you can seize the opportunities. Most likely you cannot do what you wish and more than often you will find yourself in a situation that first you cannot do anything and next you are forced to make moves that help the opponent.

The biggest downfall of the game, however, is the scoring. Controlled areas are all scored differently depending on the number of stones of the same colour touching each other. The value of a group is defined by n², where n is the number of stones. You can imagine how difficult it is to calculate the score at the end (or mid game even). Thus the game works much better online (e.g. in Yucata), where the scoring is handled by the computer. In addition, it easy to reach a situation where the player who is lucky enough to form one bigger group is pretty much guaranteed to win the game automatically since, this one big group easily dominates several smaller groups. Of course, this is the nature of the game but it is not really entertaining to keep playing a game that has been decided long time ago. So, despite being a fast playing game, certain games of The Rose King can be a bit long. You just keep beating the same shit ad nauseam. 

It is great that the rules are simple. However, this time they might be a bit too simple since the game feels a bit monotonous. A few more twists especially in the area of longer term planning would have been nice.

A decent game, abstract with movement/counters placed by cards. Like most abstracts, it takes a few plays to get the basic strategy,  but I don't think it has the depth of appeal that Hive or Santorini or the Duke do. Still worth adding to your collection.

A bit dry, perhaps, but I liked it.  The way the scoring works, though, it really comes down to how big your big group gets.  It's really hard to catch a player who manages a 13-square area.

Rosenkonig is pretty typical of the Kosmos two-player line: quick playing, rewarding a bit of thought, but not demanding too much of that.  It is one of that family of games in which the object is to place your pieces in the largest possible groups.  The difficulty is that where you can place is limited to where one of five face-up cards will allow. The thinky bit is about seeing the ramifications of any given placement. Those five cards keep the analysis paralysis in check.  Hero cards that allow an opponent's stone to be flipped to your side are a key to the game.  You want to put your opponent in a position where they have to use one for little gain.   

The artwork is OK.  My Kosmos Klassiker fur Zwei edition has a darker map than the original.  I think I prefer the original.  Card quality is to their usual not great standard.

A nice quick game for 2 players that involves taking turns to play cards to move the crown around a board and then planting your markers. Once space starts to run out, you have to think quite a bit so it's not quite as straightforward as it appears. A far better game if the cards are played from hand.

Finally learned this one on 2/15/06 and liked it. Fairly fast moving, theme independent, abstract strategy game. To do well you need to be able to anticipate your opponents moves and plan accordingly. Two plays with Jenna on 3/21/07. I smoked her the first game by splitting up one of her larger sections and she thrashed me soundly on the second.

Two player only abstract game.  Try to take over the most consecutive spaces to make the largest kingdom.  You can however use your special cards (three only) to take over a players piece.  This game is good but I have yet to play a game where the scores were even remotely close.  Someone always tends to run away with the game.

RATING: 6
It is themed around the War of the Roses, but this is strictly abritrary.  It is truly an abstract area influence game.  In this regard, it is a solid little game.  It has a bit of the feel of Othello and Go, but with unique placement rules (limited by the pawn's position).  The card draw ensures the game stays at a lighter level since it introduces a luck element.  One of the better games in the Kosmos 2-player series. [GTI Code: APSL]

RATING: 7.9
A lighter game than Henn's Alhambra, but still pretty thinky despite its simplicity, in that you've got to make sure you position your tokens to score big territorial multipliers, and know how to combo those movement cards and heroes. Good abstract if you're tired of Checkers and Chess, but don't want something as involved as The Duke or Tash-Kalar.

Fun little abstract.  Matches between skilled players can take on a chess-like dynamic (which is good, in a battle-of-wits sense), but the fact that moves are restricted by available cards in one's tableau prevents the game from degenerating into the wholly computational game that chess is.

Take the checkers. Remove all your allowed moves. Instead draw a card which will tell you where to go.
This is Rosenkonig or whatever the name of this completely random game...

I don't get it. How can from a traditional okayish game fall down to a completely broken game?

It is still more fun than flipping a coin and guessing which side will win.

It feels like a weird version of checkers. Or maybe Othello. It's very innovative; however, the luck of the draw can bring doom to an otherwise thoughtful game. Fun once in a while, but not a game I'd always want to play.

With Lost Cities this was the first of the Kosmos 2 player game range that we got our hands on, a stunning start of an excellent series, and like Lost Cities it is still one of the 2 player games that we take with us most when we go walking. It depends on table space during pub meals afterwards which one comes out.

ROSENKÖNIG: I'm slowly becoming a complete Dirk Henn convert. Although his designs might strike a lighter note than those by some of his fellow designers, his certainly hit that soft spot with me, and Queen has a knack for sticking his self-published games in attractive coats. Even though the theme often, like here, is a bit like the emperor's clothes (don't look too close), the quality certainly invites game play, something that can't always be said for Dirk's original designs.

It is a clever variation on Othello or Go, with a bit of Robo Rally thrown in for good measure. What we get is a nice, complete open information, abstract game where (bad) luck does not get in the way of intriguing hand management. The choice of playing OR replacing and the maximum hand-limit of 5 cards throws up a whole range of subtle strategy variations and playing your cards to your greatest advantage is always a fun puzzle. Forcing your opponent to play certain cards, or better, the power cards itself, by taking away all alternatives is a challenge and a half, and certainly a big step towards victory.

The card draw can be a bit uneven handed though, but games are quick and diverse enough that I'm quite happy to play a best of 3 or 5, and we usually finish those before the pudding arrives on the table. Granted, we're not the fastest eaters, but this game certainly is distracting. Games tend to be close, eventhough the exponential increases in scores for the larger areas does mean that at times there is little point playing on past a certain stage once the reversal cards have been eliminated. Mostly it is tight til the end though, and that's excellent stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love the theme, even though it's not strongly attached to the game itself, and the game is a very nice, if somewhat light, semi-abstract.  Your move options are limited by the cards in hand, and so there's optimization based on what you have.  I prefer to play with hidden hands, which reduces strategy but increases the pleasure of surprise and bluffing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good abstract game.  A more strategic kind of Othello with limited opportunities to reverse your opponents color.  Exponential scoring system forces players to play close attention to size and scale of piece of clusters.

Two dozen plays and still going strong.  I should probably comment on the game then, since it's very underrated on this site (or overrated by me, depending on your perspective).

Objectively I think a lot of people will think this is just OK.  Hobbyists tend to be tasters -- play two games, then on to the next thing.  If it doesn't grip, it's a 6 and added to the trade pile or something.

You tasters are missing out.  This is a [i]perfect[/i] game if you (a) like to think on your turn, and (b) you don't want to worry about long-term strategy.  In that sense it can be compared to games like Schotten-Totten.  Like that game, we've played this many many times but have yet to tire of it.

This is currently one of my wife's favourite games and one of our most-played games in our collection.

By the way, to those of you who inexplicably call this an Othello variant in your comments -- what are you smoking?  Don't hold out on me.

Played this on iOS a few times now. Wow, what a game! It's incredible how simple rules & card play make for difficult decisions. Knowing what your opponent can do and planning your moves 2 or 3 in advance is crucial to winning. It's an excellent brain-burning exercise, and the iOS implementation is flawless. Almost makes me want to get the board game. But when I can play 'hot seat' on the iPad, not sure how much the board game version would get played. Plus, the program handles the scoring math. Excellent game!!

After three weeks owning this game,  was able to find 25 minutes to play it last night.  It hits my sweet-spot for two-player games perfectly.  I love Kahuna and Einfach Genial for two players, and now I love Rosenkonig.  The movement of the king piece through the countryside, with the intent of not only laying down your influence markers but also trying to force your opponent into Zugzwang, really give a kinetic feel to this abstract.  The pieces and board are first rate... the cards are too small but OK.  This is the type of small, short game I can obsess over for a few months.  I give this a high recommendation.  My wife liked it very much as well.

Probably my favorite of the Kosmos 2 Player. The open hands create some potential for Analysis Paralysis, but usually you can quickly determine the best move with just a glance at your opponents cards. The unusual scoring system forces some unique strategies and hard decision making about how best to use your Hero Cards. Both Offensive and Defensive plays can result in huge score changes and with careful planning (and a few lucky cards), it is possible to come back to victory from behind at game end. The theme, as others has mentioned, is pasted on, but the components (especially the board) are so beautiful that it's totally forgivable.

Though it can be a bit dry, I find this a soothing and interesting abstract with enough strategy to keep my interest up. The face-up directional cards, maximum 5 per player, drive the thing in interesting ways. 5 is just the right number: fewer and you wouldn't have enough options; more and you would start having to think too much about what your opponent might do on their next turn. And that, by the way, is the key to winning: figure out, quickly, on each of your turns, what your opponent would be likely to do next depending on where you left the "crown piece" at the end of your turn. Then shoot for the optimum combination between getting yourself some good points and leaving your opponent in a crappy position for their next turn.

This game has been a roller coaster ride for me. The game is a blend of strategy and luck. The luck coming from card draw. The abstract nature of this game makes me hate the luck aspect because it can turn the game drastically with one move. However, I am still intrigued by this game and I really enjoy playing it. I feel like I shouldn't like it as much as I do because of some random elements, but I do get excited to play the game because it truly is battle to win. More times than not experience and strategy will win the game. Overall, it is strategic and challenging and keeps me coming back for more.

Cool game. You try to build big territories of your own color. Both players have up to five movement cards lying openly in front of them. There are also cards that allow you to turn an opposing chip over and make it your own if you can land on said spot by using one of your movement cards. This can drastically decrease the size of the opposing territory. I have played games where such an action triggers a 140 point swing. So you must be focussed at all times. Highly tactical and replayable. The theme of the war of the roses is only pasted on but that doesn't matter to me with this game. Really good game. I'd check it out if I were you.

You're supposed to move a crown by playing cards, and then drop a token in your color where the crown ends, but we played that you play a card, drop a token where the crown is, and then move the crown based on the card played. The effect being that instead of trying to get the crown in the good spaces, we tried to get it into the bad spaces. It was almost like a pure inverse of the actual game. Which was ok, but I suspect the game when played by the actual rules is even better. Most games usually are. But our one inverted play was enough for me to understand the game and move on.

I was never sure about buying this game, and when I eventually decided 'what the heck', it was already gone from many shops: the Dutch distributor stopped making it a while ago. With hindsight, I am glad I put in the effort of tracking down a copy. It is easily one of the better 2 player-titles from Kosmos/999 Games, with a rather curious scoring mechanic which forces players to keep on adding to big stretches of land, and do their utmost best to break up that of others. Such is the effect of a square power! Intersparsed is the continuous temptation to use a power card, which are really best saved until the last possible moment, but in all games I've played sofar, temptation was too great. Because all cards are open, one can plan ahead a little, although the luck of the draw can still have an exceedingly brutal influence. Nevertheless, a rematch is easily agreed upon. The main disadvantage is its weak theme, and despite the sometimes confrontational gameplay, my sweetheart girlfriend keeps insisting it is 'very romantic' because of all the beautiful roses on the board, the cards, and the stones. I think that making this a wedding gift is not such a good idea, however...

This game has simple rules and plays rather quickly. It is interesting to play. Each player has four opportunities to flip an opponent's marker. A lot of interest comes from deciding when/if to use this option. It is a good idea to keep an eye on your opponent's cards so as to know what their options are.

A Game of tactical maneuvering for two players. Knowing when to move, when to attack and when to draw more cards to further increase one's options in relation to the opponent are crucial skills. Open information on possible moves keeps analysis meaningful and managable.

RATING: 3.5
Mechanically, I eventually decided this is somewhat interesting.  BUT I personally had trouble tracking where the crown would end up and what all the possible options were. As a result, I made a few key mistakes during my first play that were frustrating because I thought I had thought through everything and I still missed something.

In summary, I never got a feeling of reward for intelligent maneuvers and instead I only ever got the feeling of being punished for my mistakes. I dislike that type of game (see my comments on Scotland Yard which gives me the same feeling).

Notes:

Strategy can be developed and planned, due to both players cards been open in play. The game plays relatively quickly and has a fair amount of options available to you, but you must be aware of what you opponent can do, otherwise you will play yourself into a corner. A bit disappointing with the production quality. Might consider changing the cardboard tokens with wooden pieces. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: Simple, subtle board and nice wooden pieces with easily-distinguishable colors. The cards are functional, but nothing special; the numbers on them need to be larger.

Experience: Interesting tactical decisions, especially with all cards face-up. An engaging game of positioning my pieces, planning ahead with my cards, trying to limit my opponent's options, and budgeting the use of my hero cards. The player who depletes their hero cards first is in trouble.

RATING: 8
I've only played this as a four-player partnership game with open cards, but it works great that way (no table talk allowed).  Very abstract but lots of tension in trying to steer the king towards your regions (or towards breaking up your opponents' big region with a knight).  It makes my head hurt trying to traverse the decision tree, but it has a small branching factor-- often players have zero or one choice-- and a limited depth due to the random card draw.  Feels somewhat like a cooperative maze.

The game takes Othello and adds a bit of flavor and flair to it. Playing with open hands as mentioned in the rules is a tedious drag, keep those hands hidden, otherwise each turn just takes forever as every single cause and effect is analyzed - And to be honest if I wanted a deeper thinking game there are so many other games more entertaining to wast my brainpower on. It is abstract but gussied up with an aesthetically pleasing War of the Roses imagery. The downside is that it is two players which means it gets little play around my parts, but one that I think actually deserves to be available easier and on a wider scale.

2 személyes, s mivel iylet ritkán játszom - eléggé elkerült, pedig már vagy 1,5 éve ott a polcomon az új kiadás. Végre próba. Jó. Gyors, figyelős, tervezhető. Ugyanakkor így egy játék után - csúnya 150 pont különbséges vereség, egy sosem játszótól...szóval vagy én voltam nagyon béna -azonkívül persze, h ellenfelem jól játszott-, vagy csak elsőre nem éreztem rá a játék stratégiájára. Ugyanakkor viszont tetszett. Végig izgalmas volt, de némileg talán szerencse is - a nagy különbségű vereség részben annak is köszönhető volt, h egy blokkoló kövem sikerült visszafordítania, és ezzel egybefüggő 16 elemes területe lett a 7+8 helyett...(Pontban: 256 a 113 helyett, nem mindegy...)
Szóval elő fog még kerülni.

2018-01-29 : First play. I've been aware that this abstract game exists for a couple of decades, yet never got around to it. Abstracts are not my thing and it's rare that a 2-player game hits the table anyway. But finally it did and I'm glad I got the chance to play it. It's quick playing and not so deep that you can't wrap your head around it. Almost the perfect weight for me.

This is an interesting abstract strategy game.  I really like the components and the cards.  You would think it would be quicker and lighter than typical abstracts because of card drawing.  Yes, there is some luck involved with that regard but strategy will usually overcome poor card draws.  Unfortunately, I feel that where you can see your opponents cards, this bogs down the game play since you really must look at a wide spectrum of actions/reactions.  This isn't a bad thing for people who like Chess, however I've discovered that abstract strategies feel more like work than fun when it comes to my tastes.

Dirk Henn is certainly one of my favorite designers.  This game falls exactly in the type of game that I like very much: learned in seconds yet you spend so much time anguishing over the possible moves.  Wonderful game with tons of replays ahead.

Nice relaxing two player game.  Lighter than Jambo, but easy to learn and fairly quick to play.  While many Kosmos two player games seem like card games, this one feels like a miniature board game.  Good family/spouse game for two, and a nice option for playing with non gamers.  Not as interesting in it's decisions (or as tense) as Lost Cities or Battle line, but still fun and very nice to look at with good bits and a pretty board.  I'm really liking the Kosmos two player series and am looking forward to picking up more...

I'd like to try this game with hidden cards, we never play it seriously enough to study the look ahead.

Interesting strategic choices... up until the endgame, when you draw garbage and your opponent autowins.

More seriously, it might work better with hidden hands but even in that case the endgame would be a problem and counting cards wouldn't help much, as players frantically search for *the* card they need to connect two groups or slice through their opponent.

A great abstract game. Unlike most abstracts, it isn't entirely devoid of luck, but it's mostly skill-based. The game doesn't seem to light nor too deep. It feels like a serious game, but it won't give you a headache like Go.

I've only played the iPhone version (renamed War of the Roses). I would give that version an 7.5 or 8. I dropped one point because I'm sure the physical version would be a little more tedious because of a number of elements from the iPhone version that are missing (someone to calculate the score for you and the graying out of cards that cannot be played).  Since I haven't played the physical version, I can't comment on the components, and I'm not entirely confident in my rating, but based on the iPhone version, I'd say a 6.5 is a good approximation.

No jogo cada jogador representa um lado da guerra das Rosas. em cada jogada faz-se uma de três ações: Usar uma, das 5, cartas visíveis iniciais que irá movimentar a coroa do Rei para uma área livre indicada na cartas de modo a exercer sua influência (marcador) na mesma; oegar uma nova carta na pilha fechada; ou usar uma carta de movimentação juntamente com uma, das 4, carta de heroi para exercer influencia sobre uma área já marcada pelo outro jogador.

Try to outmanoeuver your opponent with a set of cards which are open information. That's an interesting proposition and even though the card draws can significantly influence the outcome of a game it never feels like you are entirely at the mercy of the draw deck. A limited number of hero cards can be used to flip the alignment of opposing pieces, sometimes with tremendous effects (cutting a large area in two is devastating for scoring purposes).

Takes 1 minute to learn. For the closed-hand version, play moves along quickly and a game lasts about 30 minutes, a perfect length for this. It is a light & fun game with beautiful board, cards, & wood tokens. Will probably become a favorite. The open-hand version (which is the official version) sounds like it would be a very tense mind-bender with a lot of analysis paralysis so we will probably never play open-handed.

I'm not a huge fan of abstract strategy games, but this is one that has the feeling I enjoy. Instead of just capturing another players piece or something similar, you are actually trying to control larger sections of area on the board, which makes it feel more like a "normal" board game and less like an abstract. If that sentence made sense to you I recommend this game!

A reasonable, middle-tier entry in the Kosmos "Games for Two" series.  I'm fond of the little rosette markers and the overall look of the game board.  Choosing which card to play is fairly straightforward if you're willing to do the lookahead analysis, and so the luck of the draw will tend to dominate play.  As a result, the game sometimes has a "the game plays you" feel.  The more difficult parts of the game are timing decisions: whether to play or draw, and when to play your knights.  For a tenser, more interesting game, I recommend playing with a maximum hand size of four cards instead of five (for the two player game - the partnership game is fine as written).  Another variant I sometimes use is for each player to keep one card face down.  When played, its replacement will also be placed face down.  This introduces a degree of uncertainty into the lookahead and allows a player to goad his opponent into setting him up for a powerful or unexpected move.

This wears its need for lookahead on its sleeve, which I like. (A personal resistance to planning multiple moves ahead was part of my not liking abstracts for a long time-- it wasn't quite that I refused to do it, more like it seemed uncharitable to a game to think it was necessary, and so I would avoid it, and then lose badly and resent it.) It's also satisfying just watching clusters of your own pieces grow. And when you join two clusters, oh, even better!

The online implementation probably sharpens this by instantly displaying the ridiculously large number of points you now have, but I think I like it on its own merits.

RATING: 8
An abstract with just a (the?) right amount of luck. Except the drawing of movement cards, everything is open information. A lot of the time, the ultimate move - given the current situation - is a given, but enough times in a game there are choices to be made:
- Take a movement card, but let the opponent connect a couple of stones togehter
- Use a power card to get great gains or destroy a lot of points of the opponent, but there are a limited number of powercards so you don't want to use them up too quickly. Ending with unused power cards usually means you've passed a couple of opportunities.

The difference in strenth between players exists in the better judgement of these kind of questions.

Enjoyable 2-player game. Easy to learn rules. Not too complicated. Watching your opponents cards to not give them a move. When to play the hero cards, early or later?Watching out for the end of game if the tokens run out. Plenty to think about but not hard to keep track of it all. Definitely a date night keeper.

RATING: 6
Rating from playing on yucata -- Interesting take on connection games in which you take turns adding pieces to the board from a shared traveling marker. Not only is the scoring interesting (i.e., scoring points is n-squared, where n is the size of a connected cluster) but the movements possible are pre-determined by a hand of cards (which can be played face up or face down depending on sensibilities) so that it isn't a fully controllable game (because it's a Euro-abstract). Throw in a few cards which allow you to flip a piece (just a few!) and you've got a game in which tempo and opponent's possible plays come to matter in a big way!

It's okay. But somehow watching the cards and thus possible moves of your opponent isn't fun. And if both players, especially during the end have only one or two possible moves, it feels like the game is playing you & not vice versa.

Finally got my hands on copy of Rosenkönig, and I am still getting my head around the game- I suspect I was misplaying the powerstone placement rules, in fact.

Nevertheless, this is an attractive Kosmos 2-Player game, and it makes a nice little abstract, which promises to stay interesting because of the luck element of the power cards.

Timing of hero plays is clearly critical, as other reviewers noted- too soon, and the other player has a commanding advantage in the end game, too late and you may be forced to play them in non-ideal situations and be unable to maximize points from them.

So I expect this may actually increase in rating as I correct rules in future plays, but I can tell the flavour of the game, and I definitely like it, but don't love it yet.

So I am starting this at a 7, pending further plays.

Another great two player game from Kosmos.

The strategy of which cards to play and when to flip your opponents tokens is critical and lends great depth to a simple game.

This was the dark horse under the Christmas tree. Never expected it to be so great. We don't mind abstracts, so no problems there, and the 2-player line from Kosmos almost never disappoints. Luck, tactics and a bit of treachery at the right time makes Rosenkönig a perfect matchup for two.

This is our number one "cafe" game.
BTW, every time we dump the tokens out, I want to pop them into my mouth and start eating. What candy do they remind me of? Something from my childhood I think...

Really an abstract game at heart - theme is almost irrelevant - but a really good abstract game.  A nearly perfect amount of random element. 

Choices to be made.  The brain will be taxed just enough to be a good challenge, but not too much to feel like work.

And I love the aspect that the game can end in multiple ways (i.e., using the final stone or exhausting both players legal moves).  I have had several games in which I ran out of hero cards (too early), but was able to maneuver into a quicker game end condition (via exhausting legal moves) to hold on to the lead and the win.

I love 2 player games; in general they have less luck and are way more strategic. I really like Rosenkoning, it has a high luck factor but you can mitigate it with skillful plays.  It has beautiful wooden components and the play time is short. I haven’t seen the scoring system in any other game (so far!) but I think is brilliant. Easy game to teach but hard to master.

Enjoyable two-player game from the Kosmos line. Played it online at yucata.de. I have no idea if it is better to spread out or concentrate your influence in the start. Key is forcing your opponent to use his replacement markers for inferior replacements. Luck of the card draw plays some role in this but not too much.

I can see how opinions would vary wildly on this game.  Totally abstract (i.e. silly pasted-on theme), which can turn some off.  You can get messed up by the card draw, that's for sure.  It seems like a lot of the skill in the game is knowing when to use your hero cards.  You end up waiting as long as possible, because the moment doesn't seem right, but if you wait too long, your cards start to limit your possibilities and you could end up not even using the hero cards, which really can be frustrating.  I'm not a big fan of the "squared" scoring, as this can lead to a blow-out in many cases if you can't managed to break up a large area owned by your opponent.

Traded away.

Nice semi-abstract where you play directional cards to move a thingy and spawn tokens to form large groups. I would just as well play with hidden hands, however: working out all the permutations of possible move sequences just isn't worth it. Possible minor issue that the cards can conspire to end the game relatively early with no safety valve.

Update: Lowered one point for the reliance on the right cards to break up large groups at the end before the dwindling number of legal moves eat up your hero cards and/or end the game.

Fascinating two player game that is much more about putting your opponent into unfavorable positions.  Obviously, you want to get as many of your roses together in one area to maximize your points, but much of the game is better spent looking at your opponent's options and playing accordingly!  Being forced to play your hero cards is a pain the rear!  There is randomness in that you must play according the 5 cards you draw which limits your movement - this will frustrate some people.

Played once. The idea is pretty good, but the game play is fairly restrictive as you can only moved based on the cards you have. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it becomes one fairly quickly.

2008-12-09: I do not want to use a cliche, but if any game has a pasted on theme, it is this one. It is dry, analytical but luck dependent piece of..."game" :-! If I want to play such an abstract, I choose chess, backgammon or domino, depending on the level and taste of my opponent.
The variant with hidden hands could be more fun (and is the only reason why I rate it 4 instead of 3).
Rating could go up after a time, but I doubt I'll play this some more. 

2013-01-30: It pretends to be serious, mind-taxing abstract...with horrible luck of the draw. 
If I sweat and then lose in chess, I deserved it. If I lose a game of Rk... I could have deserved it, or I just might have been a tad less lucky.

I understand the criticism that this game feels restrictive, but I find it's all about working within those constraints. While you can look ahead, you do not know if an opportunity that presents itself now might be available in a better form later, and picking your spots becomes imperative. There will be times when the choice is obvious, but there is still a good amount of thought for a relatively short and simple game.

RATING: 8
Another top-notch Kosmos two-player production.  I usually like Henn's designs and this one did not disappoint.  It's an abstract area-control game with some great decisions to make.  Basically you're trying to create groups and each turn you can either play a power card to move the crown to an empty space & place one of your rose markers or draw a power card.  Your hand-limit is 5 cards.  Additionally each player starts with 4 hero cards which are not refilled and allow you to flip a rose marker you've moved to.  The meat of the game is all in timing.  When do you refill your cards (draw), where do you place & when do you use one of your valuable hero cards?  The crown gets moved on each turn or stays put during a draw action and determines where your opponent starts his/her turn from so in essence you're leading your opponent.  The power cards each have a direction and number of spaces that can be used; they're open so you know what movement options your opponent will have.  The rules are simple but there's quite a bit of depth.

Finally, an abstract that doesn't make my head spin. I don't like most abstracts, because I have a visceral dislike for all that recursive "forward thinking". This game has a much smaller, more constrained decision space that allows me to actually enjoy trying to think 2 or 3 moves ahead, rather than feeling like I'm drowning in a sea of nearly infinite possible moves, counter moves, counter-counter moves, and so on. Just the right balance of luck and strategy for me. 

The only drawback I see is that there are brief stretches where the game just sort of plays itself for a while, especially when both players are thinking a couple moves ahead, seeing the same possible outcomes, and then choosing the obviously better move.

Update: Had a second play that seemed to confirm my suspicions about the game sometimes playing itself. When both players are looking ahead as many turns as possible and seeing the same moves, the outcome of those next few moves is determined almost solely by the card draws. We had several turns at the end of the game where my opponent knew every move I was going to make, and vice versa. At that point, it was like "Okay, let's see which one of us gets the cards we need."

I still quite enjoy the game, but those stretches of watching the game play itself are both boring and frustrating. That smaller decision space I mentioned is both a blessing and a curse, as it turns out.

Sounds fairly abstract.

You move a common pawn around the board using cards with different directions and values.  You have 4 cards that allow you to break the rule and turn over the other player's piece.

Probably won't get it, though.

Through the play of cards, attempt to get adjacent tokens together to score lots of points (you score the square of the number of tokens). Knights allow one to reverse an opponent's color to yours. It's okay, sometimes the cards limit what you can do. Played 3 times, will have to revist soon to rediscover the strategies.

A very zen game. Moves are very simple. Strategy can be developed and planned, due primarily to the cards being shown by both players.

There's potential for a runaway victory, but the hero cards prevent that problem and even sometimes creates another problem of turning the tides too much. Still a good, nice introduction to abstracts.

Ich bin immer wieder etwas überrascht, wie sehr mir Rosenkönig doch gefällt, wenn ich es mal wieder auf den Tisch bekomme. Es ist spannend, wie sich die "Gefechte" auf dem Brett kontinuierlich verschieben. Interessant und immens wichtig ist es dabei zu entscheiden, wann die richtige Zeit für die Ritterkarten gekommen ist.

In den letzten paar Zügen kann es indes manchmal passieren, dass der Sieg allein davon abhängt, ob ein Spieler eine bestimmte Karte zieht, was für einen etwas getrübten Nachgeschmack sorgen kann.

RATING: 7
An abstract game in disguise, Rosenkönig plays smoothly but it doesn't really chart new ground - two players filling up a board striving for the longest chains of pieces is nothing new and neither is moving according to a hand of five cards that gets refilled after each turn. A small reserve of cards to substitute enemy pieces by the own ones gives Rosenkönig some bite, but keeping these cards is quite an advantage towards the middle game and sometimes bad draws can force a player to use these cards too early. In this case the game can become a bit frustrating, otherwise it leaves a good aftertaste.

50+ plays. This has proven one of the most popular two player family games in my collection. I like the way the options are visible and limited for each player - there's only so many permutations you need to run through in your head and they're easily do-able in a timeframe that's acceptable to both players. From those permutations, you can generally work out what your opponent will do if you do this, and then you do that, etc. Sometimes there are easy moves, sometimes you're trying to get in the head of your opponent and work out which of two roughly equal options they might take, and will they use up of their 4 "turnover" special plays. Attracting your opponent into spending these on low scoring moves is generally key to success. One problem I have with some abstracts is I get daunted by the huge range of limitless moves that are available. This isn't a problem here - its a nice blend of thought and luck (the turned up cards dictate what moves are available). It's abstract, so not for everyone. But it's also a kind of card game.

I've been playing this game for quite some time, in person, online, and with the slick iPad app. I can't believe I've forgotten to rate it. I love this game and will basically play it whenever, wherever. It is quite easy to pick up and get started, but it is definitely a game that rewards repeated plays as you get better at reading the ever changing game situations and the timing of your preciously few knight cards. The mechanics of area control, mixed in with 2 types of hand management, plus a helpful, though not vital, memory/risk mitigation element make for a supremely satisfying two-player gaming experience.

A pretty good abstract strategy game in a small package. The shared movement of one piece is an interesting mechanic that allows a player to try and get into a players head. The scoring is a little less than ideal. The hero cards allow for another layer of depth as well that can result in huge swings when cutting off two large chunks of territory. I enjoy the game, but I prefer Kamisado which its more minimal piece setup not requiring cards.

RATING: 7.25
Simple, elegant if themeless. This is a nice, strategic little two player game. 

Points of criticism: 
-the component quality in the Dutch White Goblin release is not good. Which seems to the case for more of their releases, at least some of the ones I've got, unfortunately. If you want to keep the game intact you'd do well to sleeve those cards right away.
-the rule where you have to use your special cards in order to make a move if you couldn't otherwise or take a card really irks me. This is just a case of "get good" I suppose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
My wife loves this one and so far has beaten me both times we've played it. The exponential scoring is interesting; an area can go from "bah, go ahead and place a piece there" to "oh, crap, I need to burn through all of my heroes breaking that up" in a couple of turns.

It's too bad the English reprint lost the nice wooden components from the German version.

6 as a board game.  7 as an app.  The preview of legal moves + ongoing automatic scoring speed up the boring bits and let you focus on strategy.  It's then a nice game about calculated risks and positioning. As a physical game, you spend a lot of time doing annoying tasks, driving players to give up and just play more randomly.

Most of the game is less random than it first appears.  The end game, however, can still have very swingy elements of luck.

It's a very dry affair, yet a decent effort in the Kosmos two player line.

Partly because of staying power I easily prefer Hera and Zeus and Jambo over this.

I gave a try to this game shortly after registering at yucata.de... and didn't expect something half that good.
The rules are so easy you could write them on a bus ticket, and yet the game is much deeper than it seems. The interaction level is just perfect (which means, there is not too much of it, but still you must pay attention to your opponent's possible moves). There is a good amount of luck, meaning that anybody can win.
Finally, a game by Dirk Henn that I like!

An interesting little game in which you use cards to move a disc and claim territory.  In the first game I played, I had a lot of fun.  However, it seemed that I kept getting cards that were really unhelpful.  Early in the game, I wanted smaller jumps and later in the game I wanted larger jumps.  I got just the opposite and often in quite the opposite direction.  At any rate, I still enjoyed the game and look forward to playing some more.  Oh yeah, being a math geek I think the scoring method (square of the area) is pretty cool.

RATING: 7.5
A quick playing and fun tactical abstract. A variation of othello and go (kind of), players start with an open hand of 5 movement cards and use it to move a pawn in order to seed their own pieces where the pawn ends its movement. The scoring is exponential and large areas score big time!

The open hand allows players to strategise (do you take risks, wait for your opponent to move before responding or try to pre-empt them?) and works very well without bogging down with AP. Games last 30 minutes with lots of tense moments. With only 24 cards, the luck element can be minimised with smart and careful play. The game also plays with 4 players.

WOW!  This is just about the best game I've discovered in almost 20 years!!!It's almost the perfect combination and balance between luck and strategy.  Most importantly it also has a nice balance between the need to "push your opponent into a corner" and the need to be in the center of the board to maximize points.  There are so many layers to this game.  It's best when played at http://www.yucata.de/ .  I'm not sure that the game would be that desireable otherwise as it can sometimes require lots of thinking between turns, especially in the middle or near the end of the game.  The squaring method of scoring is very unique and powerful.  The shape of the "territories" can be extremely important as the hero cards are used to flip a powerstone at a weak link.  Conversely, the hero cards can also be used to link together two of your territories.  Linking together two of your territories while breaking an opponent's territory in two can result in a shift of over 100 points or more.  The hero cards are very powerful weapons that you want to save as long as possible, but in some games all of a player's hero cards may not be used or may not be used in very useful locations.  One tactic can even involve a player forcing the other player to use a hero card in an undesirable location.

Absztrakt kétszemélyes játék, aminek a szabályismertetése akár 1 perc alatt is megtörténhet, mégis egy jó kis játékról van szó. Köveket helyez fel a két játékos felváltva egy kártyás mechanizmus alapján. Az egymás melletti kövek számának szorzatai adják a pontokat. Négy speciális kártyával nemcsak lehelyezni, hanem az ellenfél kövét "átszínezni" is lehetőségünk van. Ezt a négy akciót nagyon jól kell beosztani és jó időben felhasználni. A játék lehet gondolkodós is, de nem kell hosszú játékidőtől tartani. Olyan Battle Line nehézségűnek érzem és az érzések is hasonlóak játék közben.

Muszáj emelnem a pontszámon. A játék taktikai lehetőségei nem hosszú, de nem is rövid gondolkodás mellett láthatók át. A játék szerencsefaktora, játszási ideje is tökéletesen eltalált. Lehet nem is egyet kellene emelnem ezen a pontszámon...

Jól éreztem, muszáj tovább emelnem a pontszámot, ez a játék valahogy nekem van kitalálva. Bármennyi partit szívesen játszom vele akár egymás után is. Valahogy annyira könnyedén játszható mégis nagyon jó játék.

RATING: 6
Cool little two player abstract.  Getting good cards helps, but solid playing should subvert a moderately sour hand of cards.  

Nonetheless, there is a random element that prevents the amount of control that I'd like in an absolute abstract like this is.

Still the art is pretty and even getting whomped, I feel that the game is still engaging till the very bitter end.

A good 2-player abstract game with a little bit of randomness (the way the cards come up) to make things more interesting/fun. Been too long since we've played this!

RATING: 7
I liked this game more than I expected, since abstracts are not my favorite, especially with a small, claustrophobic board, but this one plays surprisingly well.  The different directional possibilities are simple to grasp but really make you think ahead.  The judge cards can help turn the game around, which can be good or bad depending on your philosophy.  Here it can help a player come back but it&#039;s not as random as drawing a lucky card in some other games, plus each player has the same exact power.  Also interesting to determine if you should make a move or draw another card.  May need a timer if depending on the players involved.  I still lost by a whopping 27 points!

This is FANTASTIC!  It's as much fun as can physically be crammed in a box this size!!  Superb blend of luck and skill, very tense at the end, and the theme, weak as it is, puts it just beyond pure abstract, otherwise I may never have tried it.

Rosenkönig isn't my favorite abstract, as I feel that the options in the later half of the game get very limited, and not in an interesting way.  Still, I like the concept and the backdrop theme of the Wars of the Roses.  I just wish there was more going on.

We play with closed hands - that is, we do NOT lay the cards face up on the table.  We don't know which cards our opponent is holding.  It makes it more luck-based, but also much quicker and more enjoyable.  Consequently, we play it a fair bit - a great filler game!

RATING: 8
Oddly thematic for an abstract.  I really get the feel of a tug of war struggle for control of England.  The knight cards, which let you change an already placed marker to your side, are perfect.  You have a limited supply but they can give you a sudden advantage.  They feel like reserves you've been holding onto until the right moment.

I just upped my rating to a 9.  This game is wonderful.  Incredibly simple and amazingly deep.  The interaction is amazing.  If you aren't playing the player, you are playing wrong.  I adore this game.  The very definition of "elegant".

Original comment left for posterity - One play of this game has left me questiong whether I like it or not.  I'm just not sure.  I need to play it a few more times.  For now I rate it a 6 because I find it a bit dry.

Two-player game with an English 'War of the Roses' theme.  The cards you draw determine the moves you'll make, so it is a unique gaming experience each time that you play.  It is not difficult to learn and does not require much time to play.  Fun on its own, but also as a 'filler' game or something for people to play who may have been eliminated from a longer game and are waiting for the other players to finish up.

A very good 2-player game. It's simple and easy to learn, doesn't take too long (but it's not too fast either!) yet leaves plenty of scope for tactical choice.

A really cute abstract of creating large connected areas of your pieces. Moves are heavily constrained by a card draw  which adds significant flavour and opportunities for creating forced moves and even an interesting endgame condition. Take a little bit longer than I'd like, but is an interesting abstract game.

Fun game of dancing around the board. Yes there is luck in the cards you draw, but it does'nt feel like you never have any good options. The scoring may be a little harsh for a game of this calibre. One marker in the right or wrong place is usually the difference between a win and a loss.

[Rated 2005/05/06, based on 5 plays]

(All on-line via yucata.de)

Has plenty of depth, the fact that both hands are open gives a lot of room for analysis a few moves ahead.

Squared-number scores (a group of n pieces scores n*n points) together with a limited number of opportunities to flip your opponents pieces to your colour mean you can get (and sometime plan for) some fairly wild swings in scoring in the end-game, rather than just filling in the ones and twos, which keeps the tension going.

This is one of the few abstract strategy games that my wife can beat me at about as much as I can beat her. And we both really like it. I love the War of the Roses theme, too, even if it is a bit tacked-on.

I am actually thinking about getting a copy of this, but it is on my wife's list as well and she's participating in the Secret Santa with me, so to avoid multiples, I'm downgrading my priority on this title.

It's a garbage abstract game. Your moves are predicated on having the right cards to do anything meaningful.

Nice, taut game so far.  It's a bit mechanical and dry, but the cards bring the game some variety that keeps it from becoming stale and uninteresting.  It's no fun when you draw a bunch of cards that won't help you, and your opponent starts running away with the game, but it's a minor complaint; you just have to be careful not to strand yourself on one side of the board.

I appreciate the design, and I think it's a pretty good 2-player game.  However, I feel that the complete open information acts as a double-edge sword since it invites AP.  You are expected to look ahead in each move you make (basically determining how the power card you have will affect your opponent's subsequent choices), unless you don't want to do well.  Some might even feel compelled to extend it to several plays and not just to your immediate one.  Then there is the problem that one person can take a lot of free turns if the cards work in his favor, and you'll be surprised at how often that can happen.

I like the tension and the strategy, but I also believe that it has elements that would bog the game down and make it a less pleasant experience.  Decent, but not great.

A great game for trying to use randomness to your advantage. To be lucky, you need to get the right cards at the right time. Usually you're just making the best of what you have, which makes for interesting decsions.

Remek kétfős absztrakt játék. 3mp alatt elmondható szabályok, de agyalni itt is lehet menet közben, sőt, kell is a győzelemhez, mert lehet ugyan random módon pakolgatni, de a tervezést erősen meghálálja a játék.

After 20+ Plays: My favorite of the Kosmos 2-player line, and one of my favorite 2-players games period.  Victory can often hinge on protecting one vital piece, and huge swings in points are possible.  Players' cards are face up, so while there is still a significant luck factor, a skillful player has lots of opportunity for clever play.  The design of the cards is also outstanding, which makes assessing your opponent's hand much easier.

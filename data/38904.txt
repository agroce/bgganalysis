Initial rating.  Got a rule wrong and it somewhat affected play.  Hope to try it again, as it seems to have promise.

Traded away.

RATING: 6.5
My rating of 6.5 is based on one play.

REALLY wanted to play this when Rick took it out and described it! Then, by about mid-game, I absolutely loathed and despised it. And then, as the game was in its dying moments, I was thinking, "You know, this isn't really all that bad."

And now, the next day, I find myself thinking about it all the time! I obviously need more plays, but I'm suspecting my rating MIGHT soar considerably. There is an awful lot more to this game than meets the eye.....

UPDATE: Three years later: nah, not that much more than meets the eye.

The buffalo migrate across the plain and we follow with our teepees.  Fail to keep up with the buffalo and your life expectancy is poor.  Naturally, your opponents are helping you to fail to keep up and forcing you to eat your dwindling supplies.   

Wind River is quite original in both its theme and mechanics.  However, original does not equate to compelling.  While there is undoubtedly some depth on a strategic level, I didn't find the tactical decisions particularly engaging.  I need a buffalo to supply my teepee - shall I move one from an unpopulated space or from a space where an opponent needs it?  In addition, the early game has the feel of an extended set-up for the critical and chaotic end game.

As usual with Argentum, the English rules are quirkily translated.  The board and buffaleeples are well done, but the cardboard teepees appear fragile.

This is an odd duck of a game.  Its theme and mechanics actually align pretty well, but it is not a themed game.  In fact, its play is highly abstract and that places it in an small niche of games - namely, multi-player abstracts.  If that fact doesn't scare you away, then the game holds a very interesting lesson in tactically play.  Players start in control of the game and it is not long before the game takes on a sense of controlling the players.  You know what needs to happen, you know how to make it happen, so why is so reluctant to let you do it?  For me, that's the beauty in the game.  Most abstracts don't leave you with the sense that you didn't really have full control.  This one can and I think makes it an interesting game that should be more widely looked at.

The fact that it is innovative is a plus. Besides that the game seems susceptible to an unbalancing butterfly effect (early distortions cascade hard down the game), dominant strategy (stick to the flanks and move tipis forward, then expand near the end). Won't be hitting the table if I have a say in it.

RATING: 7
Clever mechanisms with Buffalo being drawn across the plains. Downside to the game can be that the winner is established 2/3's through the game with no means to come back. 
Shame the English rules have a paragraph missing explaining that players with no tipis left can still move one buffallo on their turn!!!! Doh.
Needs more plays

Not what I expected, but still not a bad game. Slower than I thought and more complex as well, but the easiest tactics are just to go with 3 huts and start bringing in more in the end.

What a strange game. You have your tepees and try to follow the bison across the plains. I thought it sounded too easy to hit a perfect score, but as the game progressed I realized how wrong I was. The limited number of bison can quickly cause your people to starve. It was also interesting to watch one player basically lose half his tepees, just to resurrect them close to the end of the board. Wind River  did surprise me, because prior to this I suspected the game might play exactly the same every time. There's also a flaw in first-game setup. It is vital to have at least some of your tepees towards the center of the board because the bison feed in from 2 sides. That is important knowledge and makes the game almost impossible to win for anyone who doesn't know where to place initially. Just an all-around average game, nothing extraordinary.

Traded unplayed, a pity but this game had few chances to see the table because my game group don't like this type of games. I'm very sad about have been traded away this game, I expect to buy this game again some day in teh future when I find a group that likes abstract games.

Rating based on one play at BGG.CON '08.  I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this game -- there was a HUGE end-game stall in our session, but that may have been because none of us knew what we were doing.  I'd like to give it one more play with experienced players to see whether it's really as fragile as it appeared to be.

You play the head of a tribe, following the buffalo herds across the plains. You want to place your tipis near the buffalo herds to support your tribe, but you have to be able to continually maintain your tribe, which gets harder and harder as the game progresses. As long as there are buffalo near your tipis, there is no problem, but be careful that you don't fall behind the herd migration!
At the end of the game, the player with the most tipis that traversed all the way across the plains is the winner.

The tipies are cute, the bisons too. If you want to play mean, you can do so in this game. You really must be careful not to offer your adversaries great opportunities to screw you (move bisons away). Altough I liked the idea behind the game it was not that fun, but still ok.

I little bit more 'abstract' in play and feel then it appears.  With the great components, you'd like to 'feel the theme' more.  But, you end up just pushing things around the board.

A multiplayer abstract game with a theme that works. As usual for abstract games, simple rules create an open strategic space. If one player gets targeted jointly he will have a hard time but there are some means to avoid getting too much attention. Wind River offers a condensed multiplayer conflict experience in a short time frame that suffers from its dry nature. An ok game I would play again when asked but it lacks the spark to seek it out.

RATING: 6.5
More interesting than the bits seem to offer. Not easy to devise a working strategy, balancing the building of tipis (which improve control of the bison herd) and the need to get the tipis off the board at a later point.

A perfect information game.  I was not impressed.  Nothing really wrong, but nothing inspiring either.

After my vacation to Yellowstone and the Wind River area, I found myself wishing to play this again... so it is back in the collection again, at least for a while.

In some ways this game reminds me of Blokus.  No, not in game play but in how it is a very simple game but much angst occurs on a turn as you have to balance helping yourself vs hurting someone else.  Sometimes you can make both happen.  Gameplay is very straightforward.  First, move as many buffalo as you have teepees.  Second, feed each of your teepees.  If not enough buffalo are on the space, you must spend a resource cube (salted buffalo, yummy!) for each teepee.  Finally, you take one of four special actions which will either allow you to gain resources, move a teepee, reproduce and gain another teepee, or move ONE buffalo.  That's it with just one or two other minor niggling details.

Wind River is a bizarre, beautiful, thematic, abstract game based on one of the classic "tragedy of the commons" examples: The shared bison herds of the Native Americans. Your goal is to follow the bison across the plains to better breeding / farming / hunting grounds, but of course not only do you need the bison to survive but all of the other tribes making the same migration do as well.

It, like another recent favorite The End of the Triumvirate, works with the central multi-player gaming problems of collusion / king-making rather than against them. Rather than "the player who avoids conflict the longest wins" [the standard multi-player mantra], Wind River's theme is "the players who cooperate the longest win". Like Triumvirate, the game is expertly designed to plumb those depths.

verry good game.
it's always fun to play it. you have to keep an eye on the other players and adjust you actions to what other players do in the game.

staying on the edge of the gameboard is not a dominant way to win the game. it's verry easy for other players to move your bisons away from there. there just isn't a dominant way of winning this game.

Small strategic game with cool theme. Rating after one play: The players can fiddle very much with each other so the outcome of the game seems to be determined by pure chaos. I am not sure how much I like this much interaction. Still very lean design. Will have to play this more often before deciding on the final vote.

Interesting game of growing, protecting and relocating your tribe while threatening other players. All the while, the precious buffalos are drifting westward.

Note to self: don't go for the cautious well-protected teepees crawling forward. What looks like strength evaporates as the buffalo disappear at game end.

On a first play, this might be the free-form negotiation game I've been looking for. Oddly, with many games of this type, most of the negotiation seems to be putting the next player in a position to screw over another player, pointing it out and then smiling to each other. I think we might all just be dicks.

Wonderfully simple rules allow for an oddly involving game as you try to manage the flow of the herds across the prairie (that is the weirdest word to type). Yes, the easiest way to score is to collect resources and then spam new tee-pees at the end, but leave yourself with too few during the game and you'll find the herd leaving you behind...

Hmmmm. Something seems kind of off with this one. The whole do nothing once all your own teepees are off the board is weird. Perhaps that so you don't leave the board too quickly at the risk of letting other player(s) have their run of things. Still seemed weird.

Quite an original game, but you definitely need to be in the right mood to enjoy it. In the first half of a game with four, turns were very straightforward and offered little in terms of options and challenge. In the second half, people were inventing and reinventing ways to screw other players to the max during their turn. It really is a strange mixture of an abstract and a "screw your neighbour" game, but it works. Kind of. Not one for players who dislike kingmaking and screwing other players, nor for players who are prone to AP.

Appears like it could be really brutally competitive.  We understood the rules, but misplayed the game strategically.  I'd like to play it a lot to see if it's a keeper or not.

RATING: 6
The theme actually comes across pretty cleverly, but most will categorize Wind River as abstract due its simple rules with no luck or hidden information. Screwing over your opponents is a big part of the game, which might be a turnoff for some. Actually, what limits this game's appeal the most is simply how opaque it is at first- our first session nobody really had a good time but there was something there that piqued our interest to explore the game further. I'm glad we did, as five plays in this is a pretty solid, very unique experience. My only real quibble would be that the endgame can drag a bit, especially for someone who got knocked out early- this game is brutally unforgiving! Perhaps best with 3?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
A no-luck strategy game that will keep you balancing your need for points with the challenges of growing your tribe.  The game will usually come down to using resources as a tie breaker as it's a very tight game.  There is some potential for a player to become a "kingmaker" if they get into a losing position.  This one probably gets my sleeper game of the year award.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A package of pieces that don't make a great whole.  First off, if the other players in the game decide that you are dead, then you are dead.  Second, the strategy of the game doesn't feel right.  Obviously, moving teepees to the end of the board and then creating more is the right way to play.  Third, talk about themes lightly pasted on.

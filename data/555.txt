RATING: 5
This is based on 1 play.  We found the game pretty dry and to do well you have to almost plan the whole game from turn 1.  Maybe we didn't get it.  Will update score after more plays.

Definately better than we first thought, but still pretty dry.

On reflection (a long time later) I just don't think this is fun.  Downgraded to a 5.  And game traded away.

RATING: 8
Quite strategic as 'German' games go because you need to have a plan in mind when you start the game - or at least adopt one quite quickly. The sort of game that I find very dry and a bit dull these days but still up there as one of the best eurogames

After one play this feels like it's gonna be a big one.  Played with 3 which felt right for learning how everything works.  I can see this being pretty nasty with 5 players.

12-12-14: Tried it out as a two player and one of our gaming groups where euros are not the preferred game of choice, and it fell flat. :( 

The scoring method is more mathy than it needs to be (dedicate a work, get some cash, adjust protractor, convert cash to points...) and it definitely shows its age, but I think it's a very solid euro.

UPDATE 6-17-15: Traded for Tigris & Euphrates in Dice Tower Con Math Trade.

This is a cute and reasonably light game. I enjoy the added element of having limited space to play your development. I am however not a huge fan of the bidding mechanic. My boyfriend seems to like it though so we do have a number of games that include it. While I don't find this game overly interesting to play, it does have a well-worked theme and is enjoyable. Not one of our usual choices but refreshing now and again!

RATING: 10
Extremely limited action game with an integral auction component and multiple (?) paths to victory.

The game lasts seven turns, with each turn consisting of an auction phase, where each player purchases one item, and then a limited action phase, where each player performs 2 actions- purchase more useful items and/or "show your work", whereby points and/or money is generated.

The auction phase is interactive and has very subtle strategies to it.  Do you choose an item you're not really interested in, hoping someone else is, and will then purchase themselves out of the auction, leaving less people to compete with you on the item(s) you really want?  Do you get into a bidding war on an item you don't really want in order to make someone else pay more for it?

The action phase, while non-interactive, provides difficult decisions as money is very tight, and there always several things you want to do (purchase).  Also, you have to balance present financial considerations versus future point value of your profession cards (works).  Because of the tight money situation, you will often find yourself showing a work, even though you know you can get more value for it if you held onto to it longer.

There are several options/ways to score and win this game, although I think that some methods are much more dominant than others.  You can acquire jesters, lots of profession cards, and some recruiting cards and then show all of your works towards the end of the game for maximum value.  You can obtain several builders, make alot of buildings and show works early and often to obtain the 3 bonus points for the best work each time.  You can acquire valuable prestige cards and have a mix of profession cards, and use bonus cards to increase their value.  

I have finally seen the light with this game, it is an outstanding game for 3-5 players (haven't played 2-players yet), and although it can be somewhat scripted at times, it is a strategic masterpiece, that is deceptively deep.

Own the [boardgame=165358]Princess and Muse[/boardgame] mini-expansion from the [boardgame=40688]Treasure Chest[/boardgame] and a nice homemade version of the Builders expansion, and I find now that I'd rather always play with the expansion than without it.  It adds several new pathways to victory, despite adding a bit more length to the gameplay.

RATING: 9
Awesome game! Always wanting/needing that extra move you never get each turn. 

You definitely need an extra action or extra piece that seems to always be just out of reach every step of the way. This one reminds of Puerto Rico and the laying of tiles on your palazzo board makes this one more of a mind burner than PR. It just seems too short!!! 
Glad to have this one!

This is a very interesting game that is almost like playing solitaire with a group. The player interactions are very subtle. I'm very challenged at building my plaza.

I finally managed to play this one! And what a game it is... seven turns to get it all done, how agonizing!

I really hope to keep playing this one, and could see my rating going up in the future.

The design feels very unusual with its tetris-style organisation of geometrically shaped buildings, slightly unintuitive scoring system, and division of openly available resources from those only available by auction.

Hmm...there's a a lot going on here and lots to think about.  You can pursue lots of different strategies and come from behind.  I liked those things.  On the other hand, it's a trifle dry, the theme isn't very strong and there's very little inter-action between the players. 
 
It's this last quality that worries me the most.  Games like that just don't seem to provide the crucial spark.  I know a lot of folks think that this is the bees knees and I can, perhaps, understand why they would rate it very highly, but I just don't see that it could ever be a top 10 game...but it is rated that here. It's not got nearly enough sting to have any buzz for me.
 
"Fun-wise" it's kind of average...no wait a minute, it's actually a bit below average for that.  Yes, it can be fun to solve a puzzle like this, but not as much as pitting your wits against someone who's competing for the same space as well as the same resources.  Nor are you going to get gasps of surprise, shock or laughter playing this.

Having said that, I can see why it would be popular amongst those who are hard-core heavy-euro players.  And they are the biggest grouping here, which explains the rank of this game. I'm not in that group of people because I like a bit of everything (not just heavy Euros), and in any case with heavier games I like to feel that I am involved in something mentally AND socially stimulating and this  fulfills only the former criteria.  

Having said all of that, I guess if you are the sort who likes to maximise scores in an analytical way and it doesn't bother you whether playing a game paints almost as much of a solo mindscape as doing a Sidoku puzzle, then you would probably favour this over something like Wallenstein or E and T (2 other games in the top 10).

So, I'd say, this is good and worth playing again, but is not amongst the top ones I'd reach for.

RATING: 7
An interesting game with some good mechanics. 

I don't like it with 5 players, I find the lack of buildings for everyone to get at least 5 of them is a big problem and artifically forces up the value of recruiter cards when you need to be buying other stuff. The recruiter card feels odd being in the auction section when extra building cards are not, maybe they should have a flat fee higher than a building.

Puts player number 2 in a great position to the get the extra card for much less than everyone else will need to pay for a recruiter. Also, with 5 players you are much more under the influence of using what you get in the inital draw, with fewer players you get more opportunity to tailor your hand.

+ Tough decisions to make based on the very limited actions that you get throughout the whole game; Building up to bigger works give a good sense of accomplishment.
- The theme is a little dry.


Why it's previously-owned:
Yedo has a similar building-up-each-turn-to-put-out-a-bigger-and-better-show/mission mechanic to it.  This game's theme was a major strike against it, and with Yedo to take its place, I don't think it'll be missed.  
I traded this away for A Few Acres of Snow.

Intriguing mixture, where you have to make a lot of different choices and swap strategies as different prestige, profession and bonus cards are drawn. The game is designed to reduce luck down to a minimum and most variation comes from competition for the resources with other players. Great fun.

This one I like!  Many options for strategy.  Lots of choices.  Player interaction via auctions and limited supply.  Very interesting!  Rating may improve with additional plays.  I'm glad I bought this one.

Note:  There's a problem playing this with 5 players.  The obvious opening round move is to snag a Profession card with one of your two actions (draw 5, keep 1).  5 players means 6 of the 21 Profession cards remain.  The 5th player to get a Profession card will draw only 2, keep 1.  Very, very bad compared to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.  Best played with 4, not 5.

This is just my favorite game. Like the bidding so much in this game. I think the choices you make in the first 3 rounds are decisive, for me this game is a brainbreaker but in the most exquisite way.

Great auction game, I enjoyed every aspect of it, the positioning of buildings on the city reminds me of Antiquity (of course it was Antiquity that took this idea from Princes of Florence). Making the jobs is important but not the only way to achieve victory. It don't even manage to deliver enough points, but being without money is very dangerous, so you deliver works almost every round, the rounds you don't are the ones were you can make more points and achieve victory. Excellent game.

Low player interactions...but that means that other people cant really screw you over.  There is player interaction, but not much at all "people trying to screw each other" interaction...which I like about the game.

Great game with a fair amount of depth, and very little luck.
A great opportunity for skilled players to be able to win without relying on luck, and without allowing people to go into 'gang up on the leader' mode.  (Of course, if those are the things you like in a game, this probably isnt for you.  I myself like to have a chance to win or lose a game based on skill, and not based on which players got screwed over by which other players actions.

Det finnes også en auksjonsdel i spillet. Vanskelig å komme med direkte råd, for du må se ann hva de andre gjør.

 where you become a patron of the arts and try and oversee the creation of the greatest works by building theatres, laboratories and also lakes and parks for those silly artists to get inspired by. 

The first part of each turn is an auctioning game. Thing is, while there are several of each item only one player can take each auction item every turn, so you may have to adjust your plan!

The second part of each turn you can choose two further actions - buying buildings, completing works etc.

The time constraint is brutal and forces very efficient play.

Update: Trading as never gets played. This is the Rio grande Alea big boxed sized edition.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed PoF because it's a relatively short, compact game that has multiple strategies for scoring points. The game is 7 rounds long, which takes between 1-1.5 hours to play. My favourite element of PoF is that it forces you to adapt depending on the game situation.

In PoF, you are forced to pick a strategy fairly early in the game, plan out several moves ahead, re-evaluate and modify your strategy based on auction results, and react to what other players are doing. There never seems to be enough rounds to do everything you want, and yet you have to figure out a way to make it work. Since you are limited in what you can do in the action phase, you need to ensure that you time your actions properly. 

On the other hand, my sister is not a big fan of the game. She says that it feels like she's trying to catch a runaway train (in this case, the work value minimum goes up each round). She says that you're always running out of time and money, and you can't do everything that you want to do. She'd also doesn't like that you can only perform some actions only once during the action phase (i.e. buying a freedom or profession card). She likes Power Grid better. 

RULE MISHAP: We thought that you could only have 1 action for the round if you selected a freedom or profession - my sister is interested in trying PoF again to see if the game improves. For me, it may make my rating go up! 

UPDATE 1: Now with a few more game titles under my belt and having played PoF with heavy board gamers, I've downgraded my rating. There are just so many other board games I would pick to play over this one now - whether it be a heavier one or a light, short game. UPDATE 2: Not as interested in playing this one, but maybe the reissued, redesigned edition will spark my interested. 2015 UPDATE: hard-to-read card text, boring graphics and theme, restrictive building placement, and dated art puts this one in the trade pile.

The most strategic of the top games. If you don't know what you want to be doing for the rest of the game, even if you don't know the order yet, by turn 2, you are not going to win. But you still have to be flexible to pull it off.

A well-themed, highly interactive game! And you've got to understand where my 7.99 rating is coming from: I'm rotten at standard auction games and rotten at spatial-type puzzles, both of which Princes of Florence is. Therefore, I am guaranteed to lose every time. I just can't handle this kind of game! I wish I could, because this has got to be one of the best games ever designed! Far better than Puerto Rico (with which, for some strange reason, it's frequently compared). If I actually COULD handle auction and spatial-puzzle games, Princes of Florence would be a 9 for me.

It's all right. The auction is sort of the game, with players each trying to assess their needs (or a jester! which fulfills anything) and then the rest of the game is just sort of an immense efficiency exercise.

It's extremely tight, with so few actions and so much to do, and I think the components can be well-balanced.

Taking money and completing works early is essential (also for the bonus), and there's a big element in timing your works (I assume one won't be able to complete in every round) and boosting them just so to get the point bonus (a pretty big bonus).

And then, like any game of this sort, players are loath to take a "non-productive" action (in In the Year of the Dragon, this would be buying an ultra-valuable privilege), which here would be getting the Presige cards, say, as that's one of your seven auctions, but those can really determine the winner.

There's a bit here, but it's maybe just a bit calculating and head down over your own tableau for me ... I prefer the designers' El Grande over this. By a wide margin.

---------------------------------------------

The auction is certainly flat for two, as bidding (as in Power Grid) can sometimes be flat with both knowing that you can get something else for face. Meaning that you often have to auction the same things (jesters, I suppose?) in order to prevent your opponent getting them cheaply. Which means that some of the metagame of throwing in something that others want to set off a bidding war (of which you aren't involved) gets pulled out.

Still, with two it was a deep game that had a lot of things going on and with a bunch of (good!) point swings. Many out there aren't fans of secret objectives, and indeed I won by merit of my two prestige cards, but I think they're fine here in that they're auctioned and often you need to get them early (at critical cost!). I think with two the secret objectives might be a bit too easy to pull off, especially late, as there is lighter competition in auctions and such, but it's a good play.

The bad thing about Princes of Florence is that it's very calculable.  The rules booklet even provides an exchange rate for the game's two currencies, florins and prestige.  In addition there is a very low luck element.  There are card draws but you get to draw five from a small deck and keep one, so either you will draw something useful or you shouldn't have been drawing from that deck.  

What rescues this game from perfect planning and low replayability is the auctions, which constantly force you to switch from plan A to plans B,C and D, re-calculating as you go.  I'm not sure how I feel about all this calculation.

PoF is an efficiency game, albeit with a strong element of interaction through the auctions.  It's a classical sort of efficiency game, lean and streamlined compared to  designs like Agricola with bewildering amounts of detail and decoration.  Kramer and Ulrich give you just enough to keep things interesting. I like that.
 
No complaints about the production quality and artwork of my Alea edition. I just wish they hadn't used that awful spidery text.

RATING: 5
Princes of Florence struck me as surprisingly similar to Puerto Rico, but with an auction rather than various 'roles'.  Much like Puerto Rico it is well made and well thought out, but it is fairly non-interactive (everybody has their own board) which limits its appeal to me.

Also, getting 5 people (the recommended amount) to play this dry of a game is a challenge.

RATING: 7.5
Great old school eurogame. The rules are clear and the theme is quite well implemented. Each player has limited actions to take so each decision is critical. The bidding mechanic adds some extra interaction between the players. The game takes around 90 minutes and I recomment playing with 4 or 5 players.

Played this 3 times in the space of 3 days, all 3p, when I first got it. Enjoyable, but fairly dry Euro, not terribly exciting. There are a few different strategies to try, and would certainly be worth revisiting.
...
Have now played with all the player counts, and while it's certainly clever, it doesn't really grab me. The components have a few issues, and there isn't much to do when it isn't your turn. Quite happy to play this occasionally when others suggest it, but it isn't one I'll be asking for.

Played this classic for the 3rd time last night and I finally won!  Well, most of the players were new at it and I was able to secure the first three Jester auctions at ~ 500 Florins, which was probably at least 300 less than what it should have cost me.  So I won rather handily.  This was the strategy someone put to great effect the last time I played.  I have yet to play a game where everyone recognizes the importance of the Jester.  Interestingly enough, there were 2 somewhat experienced players in this game, but I was the only one aware of its power.

It's hard to escape the multiplayer solitaire feel. It's a very good game, but it's too easy to get wrapped up in your own buildings, and not take enough incentive to stop others.

I actually like a lot of what goes on in Princes of Florence.  The way that auctions really make you choose is a delightful, if not sometimes painful, situation.  The round limit ensures the game doesn't overstay its welcome.  Action Paralysis is kept pretty low as the number of things you can really study are limited.  Even luck is kept low thanks to any card draw letting you choose from the top 5.  Sure, you might not get what you want, but you can pick the best of what's left, or you can steal a card someone else might really benefit from.

It's not a perfect game - there's certainly some unfortunate situations from getting locked out of things, but overall it tends to be enjoyable.

An excellent game with 2 things I am not so keen on:

Brilliant tight auction game for five experienced players.  Suffers from the problem that the items at auction are difficult to evaluate for new players (i.e. if the experienced player is allowed to buy jesters for cheap, then the game will not be close).  Also suffers from the problem that at certain times the decisions are illusory: one option is clearly superior, but the others remain as traps for the uninitiated.

Caveats aside, with a table of five experienced players, this is simply marvelous.  Perhaps the best of the Alea line.

(N.B. I have not played with any of the 'expansions' included in more recent printings, nor do I have any desire to do so, as I do not see how they can improve the game, but I can see how they could significantly weaken it.)

Only played the German (with paste ups) version so far. Needs a further play but I did enjoy it even though I lost badly. The auction didn't seem particulary exciting but this was probably due to playing three players.

Played again with a full five. Did better (third equal) but the auction is still a bit flat for me, I prefer the "intense auction" of this style as seen in Colosseum. However I concur that with this "once you've won one you're out" system it makes the decision as to what to invest in a bit more difficult. I really do like the game although not quite as much as Colosseum.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
the auction style where one is forced to increment only by 100 is thought-provoking, still not sure if it's worse for the game than player-sized bids but i do like that it seems to force people down different paths.  no complaints about the solitaire-style stuff really, as the auction interaction is enough and i think it's ok to have some games out there where direct leader bashing isn't an option.  i do wish that the development did more than add work value, though, and contributed something in the way of effects.  turn order issues seem present, especially with the rules as written in 5P games where player two will get an extra profession card.  i agree with the variants that address that by pulling the leftover card and allowing it to be used for recruiting only, but there are still issues with how many times a person goes first and last in a round as well as earlier players getting better picks out of the profession deck.  i've still become a bit fascinated with the system, though, and look forward to every play.

After 3 plays, I quite enjoy it.  Was easy to learn and teach, and has just enough meat on it to keep it tense and interesting.  What you get in the auctions seems to make ALL the difference in a close game (and all my games have been close), which gives it a unpredictable side thanks to player competition (for this reason, it confuses me why I don't like Power Grid more than I do...)

I worry, though, that it might get old after a while, since I tend to do (roughly) the same strategy every play.  Time will tell if this holds its charm in future plays.

I am just unsure; I like the mechanics of this game, but I think real competent play requires a familiarity with the components -- the different jobs, buildings, bonus and prestige cards, and so on -- that I just didn't have this first time out. I still had a good time and would really like to play a game all the way to completion.

UPDATE: After two games, I have learned two things: One, never let someone get two jesters, much less four. Two, this is a pretty good game.

This is a clean game that plays faster than expected due to the fixed number of turns.  It is a game that requires knowledge of all possible combinations before play can improve.  Without the knowledge, forming a viable strategy is unlikely.  Player inaction is low.  Building your principality is much less difficult than it may seem.  The challenge is in selecting a strategy and in knowing what each item is worth relative to other players' strategies.  Game play improves with experience.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

No questions as to why this is such a classic...the theme is great, building the Palazzo is satisfying, attracting the professions, having them make great Works for you, and then all the other types of cards, freedoms, bonuses etc that you can use to maximize your strategy. The Special Profession cards also contribute an extra layer, though I think when introducing this to someone new I would leave them out the first play. Excellent Euro.

One play with three people (myself and 2 opponents) all learning as we went. With more people the auctions are going to be more expensive and the cards will cycle through a lot more so I'll have to play like that before deciding how I like it that way.
Until then though it was a good game, once we got the order of things sorted we were able to move through turns fairly quickly, most of the time. The three initial profession cards are going to be a huge factor in what else one does though, that luck may annoy me later on.
2008-09 A fourth player does make things more expensive and getting almost all the profession cards bought was new to me. There didn't seem to be as much competition as I'd expected though, playing with five should be interesting though.
2009-08 Playing with five leads to a lot more competition in the auctions and the Recruiting cards become much more important.

Két okból vettem meg: olcsón jutottam hozzá, és magasan volt rangsorolva. Nos, nem okozott katarzist, de jól össze van rakva, és végül is szórakoztató volt. Hogy mondják? Nagyon jó iparos munka, de nem korszakos alkotás. Szerintem. A szabályok egyszerűek, de a sok döntési lehetőség miatt agyalós a játék.
Művészeket kell a palotánkba csalni Firenzében, a mecénások korában, és úgy építkezni, hogy minél idillibb környezetben alkothassák meg főművüket, hogy az ezáltal minél értékesebb legyen.
A játék hibája szerintem, hogy 7 kör van, így nincs olyan játékosszám, ami esetén mindenki azonos számú körben kezdő. Ennek fokozása, hogy 2 játékosnál a játék legelején elveheti a kezdőjátékos azt a szabadságjog lapkát, amiből 1 van, így a másik végig nem tud szerezni a játék során (megjegyzem ettől még nem a kezdő nyert esetünkben).
Sok eltérő stratégia is eredményes lehet, a fent említett hiba ellenére is elég kiegyensúlyozottnak tűnik játék! Mindenre nem lehet egyszerre ráhajtani, hisz összesen 21 dolgot (épület, kártya, liget, stb.) szerezhetünk, de összesen több, mint 10 félét. Könnyen elmehet a dolog hosszadalmas optimalizálgatás irányába, szóval meg kell gondolni, kivel játszunk:) Én a presztízskártyát sokkal erősebbnek érzem, mint a bónuszt, bár kockázatosabb. Az átcsábító kártyának nem sok értelmét láttuk,de nyilván azért, mert kettőnknek jutott minden féle épület. 
Nagyon sokat számít, hogy jókor kezdjük átváltani a művekért kapott pénzt győzelmi pontra!
A nyelvfüggő kártyák még németül sem okozhatnak gondot, néhány szót kell csak érteni.
Szívesen játszom vele még, de valószínűleg nem lesz kedvenc.
Még annyit, hogy több  játékossal nagyon korlátos lehet több dolog is, pl. építőmester... Kipróbálnám, milyen mondjuk 4-en.
---
Szerencsére újra előkerült. Most hogy többet is játszottunk egymás után, egy nagyon jól sikerült játéknak érzem, javítottam is egyet a ponton. És ami fontos, hogy 70-80 perc alatt simán lemegy egy 3 fős parti. Ma már az átcsábításnak is látom az értelmét, volt olyan parti, ami ezen dőlt el. Minden játékosszámnál más tűnik szűkösnek. 3-an a szabadságjogok, többen az épületek. 4-5 főnél valószínűleg a bónuszok és az átcsábítások jobban kellenek.

Szinte minden partit más taktikával nyerünk meg. És még csak az alap változatnál tartunk...
---
Nagyon jók vannak a variánsok közt is, és a kieg is dob még a játékon. Elismerem, hogy a játékvégi pontkártyák közt nagy a szórás, van amelyiket szinte mindig mindenki teljesíti, másikat meg szinte soha... De ennyi nekem belefér, mivel 5-ből kell választani.
---
A kieggel egyértelműen többutas a játék. Az alapnál van egy olyan stratégia, amit kicsit túl egyszerűnek és faéknak érzek: az első fázisokban csak mutatványost, esetleg átcsábító kártyát gyűjteni. Ligeteket és építészt hagyni a fenébe. A második fázisokban egy vagy max 2 szabadságjogot, esetleg 1-2 épületet, ha több művésznek is segítenek, de inkább csak körönként 1 újabb személyiség szerzése és alkotás készítése. 5 főnél nyilván szűkös lesz a személyiségek száma, akkor több átcsábító kell. De a lényeg, hogy alkotást kell letenni sokat, mert az sokkal többet hoz mint bármi más... És a mutatványos meg a személykártya mindenképp növeli az alkotás értékét, így egy idő után nem is kell nézni milyen személyt szerzünk, 17 fölé megy az érték (5 mutatványos + 7 személy = 17, és ebben nincs benne az esetleges szabadságjog vagy épület), vagyis a vége felé tetszőleges személy leépíthető így, és darabja hoz 8+ pontot. 3 főnél működik, nyilván több játékosnál nehezebb, de ha vész esetén jobb híján épületet is lehet építeni, vagy bónuszkártyát venni. Ezzel a faékkel ráadásul a körök nagy részében mienk a bónusz 3 pont is. Kiegben és a variánsokban simán vannak olyan stratégiák, amivel ez verhető, és lehet hogy az alapban is, én főleg csak a 3 fősről tudok nyilatkozni.

Ja a kiegnél a pont nem váltható vissza pénzre, ezért ott beállhat a játék. Néhányszor hajszálon múlt, hogy nem szívtuk meg.
---
Mostmár annyira egyértelműnek érezzük a mutatványos faék taktikát, hogy kicsit el is bizonytalanodtam a játékkal kapcsolatban. Jó játék alapvetően, de nem jövünk rá a faék ellenszerére. Valószínűleg 5 főnél nincs ilyen gond, de 3 főnél mindenkinek menni kell a mutatványosra, ne legyen valakinek egyoldalan sok... Nálunk mindig az nyert, akinek a legtöbb mutatványosa volt. Akár 1000+ pénzt is megadtunk egy mutatványosért, simán megtérült. Ez kicsit csalódás, de mentségére szolgál, hogy a kieggel többutas marad a játék. Valószínűleg ha a jövőben előkerül, csak kieggel fogjuk használni, most viszont kicsit félretesszük pihenni. A közös épületes kieget is kipróbáltuk, jó kis színt visz a játékba, de nagy kockázat a másiknak egy épületet ajándékozni, nagyon meg kell kérni az árát. Hibának érezzük, hogy a tábláknak ez az oldala nem tartalmazza az épületek listáját, ami nagyon hasznos az alap oldalon.

I don't get all the hype about this game. I found it real dry, with most of the action packed in a not so exciting auction (no pun intended). The rest is just tetris-like packing of buildings in a box (so exciting!) and being ready to adjust to opponents' preferences.. all things a good player (not me) can figure out with a few practice games, I guess. Despite the fact I keep this in my country house in Tuscany, the flavour is minimal, really.

First Game: 1/20/07 
I am not surprised that this game is in the top 10.  I like it.  It certainly has a room in my shelf for a very non confrontational game.  My rating will most likely go up as I get more games in.
Rating: 7

Update: 4/15/07
I don't know, man. I actually like these kinds of games where people do their thing and see how well they do compared to others.  However, as far as a family of low interaction games, this just feels clunky and not smooth.  There seems to be quite a bit of downtime.  Maybe people are still getting used to it and have to feel their way around, bumping things over.  It is a great game as far as gameplay goes but the mechanical aspect of the game kind of leaves a sour taste.
New Rating: Still a 7.

Update: 8-12-2007
Got to play this again, and it went smoother.  I just have to remind people that they are up next and to start planning on what they want to do to keep the game moving.  I am glad I bought my own copy for it certainly deserves a spot in my collection.  This is a top quality game of auctioning that actually has the theme nicely integrated.  There are many ways to win the game, which makes the game a lot of fun.  People say that this game is multi-player solitaire but you cannot be more farther from the truth.  Sure you cannot smack your opponents around but so much of what you can do depends on what your opponents are doing.  You have to be very observant on what is going on.  One has to be alert and nimble in this game if you want to do well because you cannot just blindly follow the strategy you started with.  This is a great game.

My feelings towards the game has gone full circle.  I find the game physically clunky during game play.  Having to look up often on what I am trying to build is tiresome.  I still think it's a good game in its own right, I just won't be recommending it.  I sold my copy.

Princes of Florence is a game that sat in my unplayed pile for years, after having received it as a gift almost ten years ago. So it has the double honor of being my first "true" euro, and the king of the unplayed games ever.

In the last few months I begun discovering the great genius of Wolfgang Kramer, and I became eager to try it. Finally the occasion came and... it rocks!

It is an awesome blend of auction, action, and puzzle mechanisms, that plays in a multiplayer-solitaire way, with the player interaction limited to (the very tight) auctions.

Princes of Florence lasts only 7 turns. In each turn, there are X (where X is the number of players) auctions, followed by a couple of actions per player. So during the game each player will win a maximum of 5 auctions and perform exactly 14 actions. And will manage a puzzle-like construction site arranging building and landscape tiles.

The game is very tight, and every auction and every decision matters. It also seems very balanced, with quite a few different strategies available.

I thoroughly enjoyed my first play, and I'd love playing again soon. Too bad I feel it really shines only with 5 players.

One of my all time favourite games where timing is everything; should you horde all your bonus cards and "artists" for one massive run for the win, or eek away a few works every turn making sure you garner the bonus for most works for the turn?

Both strategies can win!  As for those who say there is no player interaction...what the heck happens during the auctions???

Only downside is that it works best with 5 and is OK with 4, but hopeless with 3.

PoF is definitely a favorite of mine, but only if I'm playing with experienced players and if I am using the Princess & Muse expansion.  With new players it is essential to fully explain basic strategies and auction values.  Otherwise the game loses its charm!  My advice for new players of the standard game is to purchase a Profession Card and a Freedom on your first turn.  Some additional advice is to not allow a 1st or 2nd round Jester to go for less than 1,000 Florin.

Although 5 is more optimal than 3 or 4, there are still some balance issues in a 5-player game.  For starters, Player 2 has an advantage in acquiring an extra Profession card.  Another balance issue is that the selection of a 1st Round Profession Card is only 2 cards for Player 5, whereas Player 4 has a selection of 3 cards to choose from and so forth.  However, amongst experienced players, the advantages/disadvantages seem to be minimal for they know how to work the system.         

3 players, 12 plays!
4 players, 10 plays!
5 players, Best, 4 plays!


Princess & Muse = 9 rating
Co-operative Buidling = 8 rating
Standard Princes = 7 rating



[b]Princess & Muse[/b] 
This expansion features an additional auction phase for 6 special characters that takes place before the action phase of each round.  The additional auction provides even more strategies and tension.  I could easily play this game every week.  If you do not own this expansion, a print-and-play version is available on BGG in the files section. 

3 players, 3 plays!
4 players, 10 plays! (w/Co-op Build 1 play!)
5 players, Best, 21 plays! (w/Co-op Build 1 play!)



[b]Co-Operative Building[/b]
In this expansion, players may place a building in such a way that it occupies space on a neighboring player's board, so that both players receive the benefit of having the building.  This is by far the most interactive version of PoF and I highly enjoy it.  Unfortunately there is not yet a print-and-play version available on BGG.  I own the Pro Lodo version, so for me, it's a non-issue.

4 players, 1 play! (w/ P & M 1 play!)
5 players. 2 plays!  (w/ P & M 1 play!)

A game I have played mostly on BSW, but have now been able to get it on my table twice.  Playing F2F really opened my eyes to the elegance and ease of play this game I previously didn't recognize.  I have played 3-5 players and have enjoyed all, it scales well.  3 players seems to allow for an easy plan, whereas 5 is everyone for themselves and a more reactionary game.

It has a good auction system and with only seven rounds, each turn leaves you wanting three or four extra actions, let alone two.  While others have argued that it plays like a multiplayer solitaire, if you forget about your opponents entirely and just build on your own, you'll end up losing every time.

Yikes.  I was really looking forward to learning this game because I'm a fan of the other Wolfgang Kramer titles I've tried, but I was completely underwhelmed.

Wow! What a great game.  Picked it up last year and finally got around to trying it out.  There's a reason it is so highly rated.  So many ways to strategize moves and win, with so many game elements that are popular included:  resource management, auctioning, spacial organization...all wrapped up in a tidy 90 min. game.  Every player we have played with (14 at last count) have nothing but super positive comments to make about this offering.  Since its introduction to our game group, it has gotten at least two plays an event, with players clamoring for more.  It is sure to be a top game in our group for months, if not years, to come.

Very nice design. The auctions and competition for best work provide opportunities for competitive player interaction, while the action phases allow each player to pursue his own strategy relatively independently (though each player still must consider what his opponents are doing to plan for winning best work, to determine the value of a recruiter, to decide how much money to save for the next auction, etc.). Players must have a long-term strategy but need to be tactically flexible as well -- a great mixture of short and long-term planning (tactics and strategy) missing in many Eurogames, which strongly (or solely) emphasize tactics over strategy. Princes of Florence is fairly well-balanced and avoids significant turn-order and king-making problems (e.g., Puerto Rico). (Although based on some forum threads it appears that starting position (seat) does have a significant impact on final score, based on who plays when in the penultimate and final rounds.)

The major flaw in Princes of Florence is that the substance of the game occurs in the subtleties of the play. It is an (or perhaps [i]the[/i]) archetype of the now quintessential 'multiplayer solitaire' Eurogame, but there [i]is[/i] a highly competitive game hidden in plain view. While newer games like Agricola or 7 Wonders make explicit the concept of denying an action space or denying a key card (while at the same time gaining something very concrete by doing so), Princes of Florence forces players to understand that while it [i]seems[/i] that each player can essentially operate independently, the entire game hinges upon the very few opportunities for competition the game provides (competition for scarce resources [e.g., works, recruiter cards], VP-to-money conversions [i.e., maximizing the return on investment for items won at auction], and best work). If a player only thinks of his own plan and doesn't force the other players to pay the 'right price' for an item, another player could easily run away with the game. Princes of Florence requires all players to possess a high level of familiarity with the game mechanics, understanding of the timing and flow of the game, and ability to correctly value items up for auction (including the implicit benefit of denying the item to an opponent). 

None of these comments inherently indicate a flaw in the game design, but rather are meant to illustrate that, relative to other games, Princes of Florence is more difficult to play competitively, and suffers as a result, degrading from an elegant game of subtle competition into 90-minute multiplayer solitaire. 

[i][Rating based on highly competitive play. For 'average' play, rating -> 7][/i]

This game has been recomended to me by no less than three sources (BGG Reccomendations, Friendless Reccomendations & Friendless Crazy Recomendations) so I thought that I might as well add it to an order for free shiping.

I really enjoyed this game, apparently the analysis hasn't gotten my preference wrong. The game is quite deep, requiring a lot of forward planning to pull off a strategy. We played with 3 players, which seems to be unloved by the BGG community, and I think I can see why, the additional chaos that would ensue from the additional players would add much more tension to the game and competition to the auctions.

Finally got to play this. Really want to play again. I shoulnd't have been so eager to build the first work, since it put my info out there for someone to steal away with a recruitment card. That taught me the lesson that maybe its best to wait and build works later in the game when they are worth more. I also majorly screwed up my building/park placements. It's important not to do that in this game. I need to play this again.

Played again. Best to get professions of similar buildings. If not possible, then get jesters. Start out with big building. Also good to know all the cards, bonus and prestige. Build work within first two turns. 

Played again. Was able to get 3 jesters and 2 bonus cards. Got insanely outbid for a recruitment card in the last round that would have allowed me to build two works in one turn, a 20 & 23. Values of items were not clearly understood by opponents, hence the lack of competition for the jesters. I still think a lot is determined by what you choose to keep from the initial draw. You need to match factors on the cards. Not just any factors, but the highest like the building type. I was able to win the game handily with just two buildings and a landscape, but all three freedoms and then the jesters.

Save bonus cards for when you really need them and because they will factor more highly when you have the stuff they require. Draw prestige early to give you some direction. Turn order determines who gets to build the work last and thus determine need for competition to gain the greatest work bonus.

If going last in turn 1, then try to build greatest work, otherwise use turn 1 to set up for  turn 2 build, unless you can build two works in turn 3.

Setup
1. draw cards, discard
2. auction
3. action
4. build works

Princes of Florence has the taste and look of a classic Euro. It has tense auctions and requires careful planning with several paths to victory to choose from. This is all done in 7 auctions and 14 actions. This is a solid design, but requires 5 players to truly shine.

Of the Euros I've played, I think this one requires the best planning.  And, I think it causes the "I wish I could do more on this turn" feeling more than any other Euro I've played.  I've usually played with 4 players but now have one play with 5 and see how it is quite a bit tougher (and better) with 5.  I would have been beat up bad in the 5 player if it weren't for a fortunate recruiting card situation on turn 6.

RATING: 10
Excellent game.  Lots of different strategies and tough decisions, but not overly complicated or difficult to teach.

In terms of strategy, Princes is better than any other multiplayer board game ever made -- when you receive your cards before the first round, you must immediately think all the way ahead to what you'll be doing in the last round.

I played Goa before this and, this has the same basic flow of Goa--rounds of bid phase then action phase; you have your own board that you're trying to maximize for points scoring.  That said, it has a few different mechanics and a different feel than Goa and so I think the two can-coexist in my collection.

I really like the mechanic of player choice on points or money.  5 player games may be a little TOO tight for casual gaming. 4 player best?

This does not appear to handle 2-player as well as Goa.

This is a terrific game and not the multi-player solitaire many people claim it is.  You are bidding against other players for limited resources to increase the prestige of your palace/province. A solid game which lasts either just long enough or maybe ends just a little too soon. A classic!

Plays like an auction/worker-placement hybrid game, which makes it unique among games I've played so far.  I like some other auction games better but this is definitely solid and it scratches a slightly different itch than those games.

Much more fun than I thought it would be. This is not dry, the theme is pretty convincing and I really liked that there were so many things to think about and many ways to score points. Don't know why this game sometimes is mentioned as a auction game, the auctoning is a pretty minot part of the whole game.

RATING: 6
Princes of Florence is an half-successful attempt at doing an eurogame that’s a bit less «euro» than the usual: it succeeded only partially though, for the system still doesn’t allow any mistake and openly favours the leader. Nonetheless I found the theme satisfyingly developed and the whole game, still too dry for my taste, quite interactive, mainly thanks to a wicked auction mechanics.

What I completely disliked though - and this is also one of the biggest problems I have when approaching any eurogame - is both the need for tracking every player’s points at the end of each turn and the usual cards bonanza allowing to readjust a player’s score and strategies, which means you’re invited to play with your mind rather than your heart: this is stuff for professional optimizers, not for people (even hardcore gamers) who only wish to have fun with a solid game.

Building/resource management game with lots of choices, but with very little player interaction.  Out-bidding or forcing someone to over-pay for a builder, or a jester, etc. is the only way to have any affect on other players.  However, cheaply getting what you need to produce a great work is lots of fun and trying to creatively cram all your buildings, parks, etc. into your court is also fun!!

RATING: 8
The first time I played this game, I wasn't that crazy about it. Maybe it was because it was the 8th game I played, 12.5 hours into a Bay Area Games Day. I didn't play it again for a year, but I did want to give it another chance. The second time I played, I really, really enjoyed it. Maybe it was because my expectations were lowered, or maybe it was just because I was awake. I still don't quite have a good strategy down, but I definitely want to play it more to figure one out. It's the kind of game in which you don't have nearly enough turns to implement everything you want to, so you really need to focus on one or two particular ways of getting points and try to stick to that, which is something I'm really bad at doing: "Oooo...that builder's really cheap. I should get it!" Of course, if I don't really need a builder, then "cheap" can never be cheap enough. Woot and Tanga were made for people like me....

Currently, I rate an 8.  This could go up.  Now that I have played it 5+ times I have some thoughts.  When I first played it, it seemed like you need to go for Jesters, period.  I remember they were bid up very high.  The Jester is great but what I seen on my last play made me rethink things.  I seen where someone grabbed builders and won with that, producing only one work.  There is a balance and you need to keep an eye on people to keep the balance in check.  Also, the group of us who have played have all learned the game together and that is really adding up to how great this game can be.  You have a plan that you want to go with but you need to be ready, early, to switch if need be. My last game, the dynamics and how things were auctioned was much different than previous games.  It's clicking with us as a group and more creative play is coming out.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A tightly designed game that is ultimately too dry, scripted, and calculated for my tastes. This is a game where if you don't have a strategy in place by the second turn for how the rest of the game will go, you're probably going to lose. It's also a game where someone can (and I've seen this done) pull out a calculator to figure out if bidding up on an auction item is worth it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but there is such a thing as overthinking it.

Great game, could use a little more player interaction.

Update:  This may be the perfect game for certain gamers.  Executing the perfect plan over the course of a game certainly has its appeal.  Unfortunately, that characteristic forms its gravest mistake.  PoF is a very unforgiving game, closing off any accessibility to newbies.  Also, because to succeed you must have a plan, often I feel as though I am just going through the motions, that my decisions are already made.  Perhaps my judgment is clouded by burning out, an attitude quickly acquired with many of these highly strategic resource management games.

Pretty good auction game, mostly because it mixes in some action point allowance.  Fairly steep learning curve in terms of getting a grasp of how few actions you will have and how much to spend on auctions.  There appear to be some set strategies or scripted maneuvers (ex. buying lots of jesters)... and this makes me dislike the game a little.  Note: Personally, I spend too much time planning how to fit my buildings & landscapes into my courtyard... and then I only end up building 1/2 of the buildings that I expected because 2 actions per turn (x7 turns) is not as many actions as you might think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
From our single play through, I came out feeling the experience was amazingly balanced for everyone involved. The downfall potentially being what you get in the auction phase may not actually be as important as you initially perceive it to be. I'm excited to play again with the expansion as I think the role cards will add more diversity so that everyone isn't playing the "same" game.

I like this game, but I like a several other games better, including Goa, Amun Re, Louis XIV, Power Grid... which all have more things to do and have either the same or more player interaction.

A great hook and fantastic production value can't overcome the fact that this game is really boring after just a little play.  Jesters are just way too good, buildings and positioning less so, and it ruins the feel for me.  There's a certain blandness to it all, and repeat play is...repetitive.

I see this is a popular game, so I am in the minority here. I found this to be repetetive and somewhat boring. There is very little interaction, fun or excitement to be had.

Older euro with relatively few rules and a very clean feel.  Strangely, I like the theme, though it's very pasted on, and I also like the main mechanic of placing your buildings and collecting sets of freedoms, landscapes, and buildings to complete works.  It feels like there's some depth here in timing when to take what items at auction and what actions to take.  A couple things about the game I don't like- the game is too "limited feeling" for me- you can win 7 auctions and do 14 actions in an entire game, also, the minimum work values in each round push you along constantly and make you feel like you don't have much freedom in your choices.  It feels like you're on rails basically with a few auctions thrown in.  Superficially similar to Vegas Showdown, but Vegas Showdown is much better.

It's old style auction game where experienced gamers feel comfortable with the game after a single play.  Valuing the different tiles may take a little bit of effort, but probably less than a game.

I enjoyed it and am hoping for more plays.

RATING: 6
This might have been a great game. it's exciting to look at and learn the rules seeming to combine so many lovely features, including a puzzle like arrange the buindings and stuff in your courtyard bit and a really nice little theme. 

Having said that, the game balance is mundane. You play the game with almost no interaction with other players - mostly solo, except for the auction phase each turn. The puzzle like element is hardly present, in reality and there is shared terrain with other players to make placement of buildings and landscapes interesting - all on your own little solo board. The theme isn't really evoked sduring play, much rather it's a game that encourages endless math tinkering optimising the spending of money - predicted return on invesstment is what it's all about, i avery tight 7 turn game. 

You play only 7 turns, so don't have a lot of things to do really, but a real lot of time to wait on people to make decisions all the same I found. 

I see so many elements of truly excellent game design here, yet so few of them seem to provide me with much of what I'd call fun or entertainment. If only there were one board with limited space which you competed for and more compulsion to build (I saw someone win this with only 1 building until the last turn for example - you can flower and succeed without having to build alas) then tehre might be some conflict and iteraction to make this game for several people. As it stands you could just as well play it alone and enjoy it as much as with 5.

I have to conclude - nice try, but not a favourite by any shot and a slight mystery to me why so many people love it so much. But tthen I said the same about the Settlers of Catan and clearly I'm not a sheep herd Eurogamer it seems. For my part I'll stick to the likes of Adel Verpflichtet, El Grande, Dos Rios, Inkognito, Mississippi Queen, Torres etc. etc. all games which come to mind that I'd rather play than this one ...

It seems heretical, if not downright sacreligious, not to love this game, but it just doesn't grab me.  One thing that always bothers me is that it feels like the game should go on for another turn or two -- just when I start getting things the way I want them, the game ends.  I usually don't do badly at it, but I also don't usually enjoy playing very much. Update:  after a year-long hiatus, tried it again to see whether my opinion had changed.  Nope!

Played for the first time 01/14/2011, with 5 people. Awesome game. I like the mechanics and the 'puzzle' aspect of trying to get the best combo of buildings, landscapes, etc to fit with professions you have or might get via the recruitment card. Will look to buy and can't wait to play again.

01/22: Second play, with 3 people. Definitely not as fun as with 5. Seems like they should have removed more of the pieces from bidding. Still, great game. Bumped from 8.5 down to 8.

Simply a beautiful game, both in theme and mechanics. There is a little more player interaction than seems apparent, especially in the bidding. There seems to be many ways to approach the path to victory - I have seen the players with the most builders or jesters lose the game because they didn't balance all their acquisitions. Prestige and recruitment cards are very important to acquire, though sometimes ignored in bidding wars for jesters and other items. One key feature is to balance the works reward between points and money. Attention to other elements such as positioning buildings in the pallazo, and obtaining extra recruitment cards are also vital to a winning combination. UPDATE: Was my number 1 ranked game in top ten for five years until bumped down by Merchants and Maurauders.

It took a while for this one to hit the table, but when it finally did, it was every bit of geeky fun I assumed it would be. This has a little of everything, auction, puzzle/board management, money/prestige point (victory point) management, plenty of strategy.  This one is an absolute geeky keeper, but not one I would introduce to new gamers right away.  When introduced to the wife, she took to it immediately.  Won't hit the table often due to length and complexity, but a really gem of a game.

This is one of those games where there simply aren't enough turns to do everything you want; and not enough actions with which to do what you would like to do even in the turns you do have. This is a good and a bad thing: it means your choices are critical ... but so are your mistakes.

A great game. One of my favourites. Well balanced. Elegantly designed. Beautiful pieces. A game that relates to the theme quite nicely.

Best with 5 players. I didn't care for it with 4 players.

I have both the RGG version and the new 2007 expansions (Quined/Ystari version). Brillant expansions by Kramer and Ulrich. The Princess & Muse expansion adds an Amun Re style auction that adds tension and more management. There was a lot more player interaction and depth of play. The other 4 players who played this expansion with me were all experienced PoF players and all agreed that this expansion complemented the base game and greatly enhances it with new texture and nuances. Actually, it finishes this magnum opus, which without it, is incomplete.

Do not neglect the meta game. It can play an important part in one's game.

Rating for base game: 10
Rating with Princess & Muse expansion: 10+

Any way you add it up, The Princes of Florence is a top notch game. Highly Recommended!!!

Update: after many plays with the Princess and the Muse expansion, cannot go back to vanilla PoF, which has become too formulaic. The P&M expansion truly adds multiple paths to victory. With the expansion, this is Kramer's MAGNUM OPUS!!!

I really like the idea behind this game, and the auction round helps to balance everything.

Still, a good game.

Not a pretty game, and I'm pretty bad at it, frankly, but I find the idea of it delightful, even if gameplay is a bit dry.  I'm always surprised at how enthused I am when someone suggests playing this.

Specifically, I like the way all the bits come together: auctions, spacial placement, purchasing with limited resources, deciding when to take money and when to take points, and trying to time everything so that you come out on top at the end of seven rounds.  There's a great sense of tension as you try to get everything done, and somehow keep your opponents under control.  And all in the name of art!

I wasn't sure if I liked this game the first time I played it but replay has only improved my opinion. This is a game where you have lots to do and not enough moves to do it all. This creates a nice tension where you need to make each move count. There are other nice mechanics which enhance this feeling, like the need to decide between scoring points which count at the end of the game or earning money which you need right now.

I keep upping my rating of Princes of Florence bit by bit the more I play it.  Princes of Florence is the ultimate game of opportunity costs (moreso than Goa!).  Through the course of the game you get seven auction items and 14 actions and that's it!  At the end of the auction on turn 4 if you don't have your last 8 actions planned out you will probably not win.  Some say the game is dry and "multiplayer solitaire" but there is so much more to it than that.  You hash out a plan and suddenly you have an opportunity in front of you that forces you to rearrange your thinking.  Princes of Florence is a true nailbiter and seems to have near-universal appeal to gamers who have cut their teeth on the likes of Settlers or Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride and are hungry for something meatier.  I now rate this game a solid 9.

I enjoy this game with just two.  We all know that it shines with five, but I'm an Alea addict who can't get enough of their Big Box series.  With a few modifications, it is much more competitive than the official two player variant.  We simply play with 3 each of the landscapes, 4 each of the builders/jesters.  For buildings, use 1 each for the medium and large buildings, with a random extra 3 buildings added for medium, 1 extra for large.  Finally, when drafting cards, only take 3 to pick from when drafting from the Bonus and Prestige decks, rather than the normal 5 (Professions remain unchanged).  The game becomes much more about economization of moves and choices rather than a chaotic free-for-all, but that's fine with me.  This is the game I wanted Leonardo to be!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very good game, with beautiful components and a really nice, classic look to it. Unfortunately, the entire game centers around an auction mechanic that makes it truly terrible for two players, and not great with three. The Jester tokens are slightly overpowered, IMO, and there is a not inconsiderable amount of luck in the cards you draw, which can give one player a huge advantage. Plus, we already own and are keeping Colosseum, which works better for our group than this.

If our regular gaming group ever grows to a more substantial size (5 players), I'd consider reacquiring this in the future, because I really do love the look and theme of this game.

Interesting game.  Seems to have a lot of elements that work "ok" instead of a few that really wow you.  I would play again.  I'm interested in seeing it with fewer players.

Update:  Played it again after a long hiatus and I've actually lowered my rating to a '6'.  It seems to suffer from Puerto Rico syndrome, where your first round actions are pre-determined if you don't want to absolutely lose the game.  Not a fan of that, and also not a fan of the rules as written, which seem to favor certain seats in turn order more heavily.

UPDATE:  While it shows its age, I actually enjoy this game quite a bit.  It's a little slow, but the auctions are interesting and the compromises you end up making are rife with interesting decisions.

This is a tough game to judge after one play.  On one hand, it is as interesting a bidding game as I have played... perhaps in some ways quantifiably the best bidding game I have played.  Lots of ways to win, too.  However, when played with people who don't bid right, the game design tends to bore. Just a little.  As far as bidding games go, I would rather play Traumfabrik or O Zoo Le Mio.  But I WILL play this again, no question.

UPDATE: A few recent plays have led me to believe that this game is even more overrated than I remember. There really is only about one way to play this game (Jesters/Substitutes), and I don't see anyway in which buying even one architect, never mind two or three, could possibly pay off. Still not bad, once you throw out a couple underpowered bits there is still enough of a game left to be interesting, but in my opinion this is one of the weakest entries in the alea line, weaker even than many of the small-box games. 
---
UPDATE: The one variant in the new ProLudo/QWG edition that isn't available elsewhere, the deal-making version, seems suspect. It so dramatically increases the value of the "substitution" cards (as two neighbors can share a big building and pass the artists back and forth) that it seems to throw that part of the system out of alignment. My judgement is that for English-language users, the new edition is not worth it. Also, playing Princes of Florence again after a long break was less rewarding than I thought. For an alea game (and a Kramer game), the elements seem surprisingly out-of-whack; the architects are too weak, jugglers too strong, and in general there aren't a lot of ways to approach this game and the various different artists do not provide as much game variety as one might hope.
---
UPDATE: Note on the ProLudo/QWG edition: I got this new edition largely for the boards which flip over to reveal one, large principality in which players can negotiate to share the costs of buildings on the borders, therefore adding a much-needed element of player interaction. Hopefully it won't bog things down too much.

One thing which surprised me, they went to some length to internationalize the Work cards, with nice symbols for the landscape, jester, freedom, etc., that give the work points (the freedom is borderline-indistinguishable, but still). So I was surprised that the Prestige and Bonus cards retain their original all-text format when they could have been easily internationalized as well. Players with both editions can easily substitute the cards from the Rio Grande edition, but still.

Anyway, I look forward to the new variants - especially the cooperative-building one - getting this classic game back to the table a bit.
---
This is a good game, I won't deny that, and I do enjoy playing it. But it does nag at me; I dunno, I do think of gaming as a social activity, and in Princes of Florence there just is no sense of actually playing with other people. You just build your little fiefdom, keep your artists happy, and that's about it. There is a very small amount of competition for a couple scarce resources, but very little you can do about it; it's all based on player position (so if I'm player number 1, I can't count on getting two freedoms of my choice, player #3 is in the best position vis-a-vis freedoms, and it's best to be 2nd or 3rd for Personality Cards ...). So while this is a good game and the various optimizations you have to do are at least interesting, amongst the alea games it certainly has nothing on Ra or Taj Majal, where you actually have to interact with, like, people. A lot of people have claimed this is one of the best games going, and I'd just to inject some sanity here by pointing out that for most players, I believe Princes of Florence isn't anywhere near to being in the same league as classics such as Modern Art, El Grande, Settlers, Starfarers, Ra, or Lord of the Rings, simply due to the downtime and analysis paralysis problems. That being said, I know there is a set of fairly hard-core gamers who actually like to try to get the human factor out of their multi-player games. A good acid test is whether you prefer Medici or Modern Art; if you preferred Medici, Princes of Florence will probably be your game. If Modern Art, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.

I need some more experience with more players before giving this game a final grade.  My two games with three players have thus far been somewhat lackluster.  I understand it's all about having 5 players for maximum enjoyment so I'm ready to try that.

I enjoy all the multiple paths to victory and the multitude of options on a turn.  I'd prefer some more interaction but the peaceful prospect of building one's own principality is nice sometimes.

While the various potential strategies are interesting, and I like that there are many potential routes to victory, for some reason this game just doesn't resonate with me all that much.  Perhaps it's because I've never much cared for games that are auction auction auction auction the entire game, especially in a game of this length.

There is some neat stuff going on here, but all the auctioning just isn't for me.  If you're into that mechanic, you'll definitely love this one though!

Updated 5/14/11.

I've now played The Princes of Florence twice, roughly a year and a half apart.  Both games were highly enjoyable.  I think that Kramer and Ulrich did a truly fantastic job designing this game.  Everything is tight and very clean.  

One of my primary concerns with auction games (on a general level) is that inexperienced players won't know how to value items, leading to mistakes that can really weaken he whole experience.  The value of nearly any acton in Princes of Florence, however, is very nearly calculable.  New players should theoretically be able to jump right into the fray, assuming that they are competitive enough to work out those rough calculations.

The most significant drawback to the game, in my eyes at least, is the art and production quality.  Everything about the game feels incredibly dated, which makes me less excited to own the game.  Like Puerto Rico, this is a good game that reliably produces entertaining sessions, but that doesn't scream for a place on my shelf.  I know it's probably silly to care so much about components, but that's one of the factors that drives my purchase and play decisions.  I like to fiddle with high-quality bits. 

Although some have complained that the the works in Princes of Florence lack variation, and I had a similar thought at first, I came to recognize that the variation comes in the fact that larger buildings appear on more works. Thus, the larger buildings become more desirable because they can save actions (fewer buildings for more works), but they take up more space and the works associated with them are in greater demand at the table. This gives everyone the same incentives, and puts the emphasis on understanding what your opponents are attempting do. Variations in the value of works themselves would increase the emphasis on figuring out what your own incentives are (akin to deciphering your starting hand in Agricola), and would hinder the ability of your opponents to meaningfully interpret your in-game decisions.

Additionally, both Goa and The Princes of Florence employ the Auction->Actions sequence. Although both have something of a bland, dated feel, I really enjoy the tension that comes from the auctions when the subsequent available action sequence is so obvious and understood. In something like PowerGrid, I never calculate out all of my opponents' possible moves (and their costs) before the auction. In Goa and PoF, I can and do, which makes both games much more interesting to me than they might be oerwise.

Renaissance Italy...patronage of the arts and sciences... What a great topic!
...Unfortunately, FvF does not live up to it. Basically, this is an abstract game with a theme pasted on, which I greatly regret as I enjoy the "timemachine" factor in games. Martin Wallace's "Princes of the Renaissance" satisfies that need of mine far better - next to being a more intriguing game anyway. 

This is a cleverly designed game - much like Goa. My gripe is however with both  Goa and FvF is that they lack player interaction - hence the term multiplayer solitaire...

Further, the Tetris-style building on your own board doesn't appeal to me that much. 

IMO, this game could have been better, if the estates would be all on one board. Buying/competing for fairly scarce land would add more player interaction to the game. That would greatly increase the importance of watching what your opponents are doing.

Yet, despite these gripes, FvF is a fine game. Though given all the praise, I won't pretend that my expectations weren't disappointed. A 5 in terms of how I enjoyed it, a 6 due to being a good design. Just not what I consider thrilling gameplay.

Interesting game, that I am glad to have finally got a chance to play.  I don't know if it is an instabuy game, as other games could easily fit what it does for me. Some auction, some Blokus, some point salad, and quite a bit of fun.  Again we have found a game that I seem to do very well with, the first time I play, but could potentially get worse at as I "understand" the game more.  I woudl definitely like to see this hit the table again.

RATING: 6
PoF is an efficiency game similar to Puerto Rico and belongs to a class of games sometimes referred to as "sandbox" games or "multiplayer solitaire" games. The term comes from the fact that there is little direct player interaction in these games, usually limited to just an auction round. Yet I find I prefer games with more direct player interaction, whether it be conflict in a wargame or more subtle interaction found in negotiation games. Nonetheless, it's a beautiful game and a beautiful, elegant design that's easy to learn and plays quickly.

I should note that my geek buddies rank this game more highly than I do, pointing out its depth and long term strategy. I agree with rorschah however, that what they're really referring to is long term analysis rather than long term strategy. He describes the difference better than I can in his geeklists. I'll also point out that I've only played this with 3 players but it's supposed to be best with 4 or 5.

Deeply strategic, much like other packing games (for instance, Antiquity) I imagine you will want to have the whole thing planned out before you even start the first round (obviously, in my only play of the game, I wasn't able to do that). As such, I do end up worrying about replayability (for fear that certain options are just plain old stronger than other ones). However, the auctions mean that you still have to be open to adjustment because the plans of others might get in your way.

It is also important to note, that it is fun to make your plans. To try to maximise your fourteen moves. Yes, it's all about efficiency, but I suspect the lack of complexity makes it interesting to me. It's not about efficiency even though the rules get in your way, it's about efficiency even though the other players get in your way.

It looks simple but, the depth of play becomes apparent when, after several plays, you learn that it is very difficult to beat a skilled player and you have little idea of how to improve.

The auction phase is the great balancing mechanism and yet it seems to the beginner that it is just another way to distribute resources.  The choices you make in the auction direct your entire play but, there are only 7 auctions and 7 turns in the entire game.  It is astonishing how much gaming and cerebral competition is packed into this simple package.

The game I love that loves me back.  I think there is still one more level of understanding that I am not quite on yet.  Just a beautifully designed game that takes practice, patience, discipline, a little bluffing, an economic understanding, planning, tactical nuances, etc.  Might I mention it also scales well.  Although I don't think 5 players makes this game shine, I'm not going to turn down a 5 player game.  My love for this game gets challenged by Caylus and others, many fantastic designs, but ultimately this wins because I prefer a game that is mostly strategic.  It's just what I appreciate.

Matter of taste. This is a fine game, but doesn't have the level of interaction that I like, and I think subsequent games have shown its auctions to be comparatively uninteresting. I also don't like the tetris-like building arranging (don't change plans). Auction/Action just doesn't do it for me. 

Update: playing this 10 years after I first played shows how much leeway I give to modern designs. I killed this game (a 4 rating) 10 years ago for lack of interaction, when POF is far more interactive than the average modern euro. Plus, the rules are extremely simple but lead to complex situations. It really is a good game. I kind of agree that it was a starting point for a different style of game design - one that's gone in a direction I can't say I am thrilled with, but this is a far cry from the solitaire puzzle solving of Feld and Rosenberg.

[u]July 2008:[/u] Great game, I feel it really is related to Power Grid, but I couldn't say why (well, there is an auction phase, but apart from that?). I've really enjoyed thos 3 plays I had and would like to play more.

[u]June 09:[/u] I'll just add that the game suffers from the problem of newbies not knowing the value of objects and that can mess with the game and advantage fairly well some players or screw others competely not on purpose. I think the game is great when played with people who are at least a bit experienced.

RATING: 6
Pretty good game where long-term strategy plays a big role compared to tactical moves. The game features different mechanics centered around an auction, but you also need to plan where to put the stuff you win in your small playing area so it has a spatial element too. 

As with most other euro games there are so much you want/need to do but not enough actions! 
The limited amount of rounds and the limited access to a lot of money make it a tight game which is something I like.

As with most auction games, it can be hard to value the different items the first time you play, but I think we managed okay. The jesters are good, but not overpowered as some tend to think. Each item is good in different areas, and if you can pick up a landscape for 200 it might be worth it compared to paying 1000+ for a Jester.

I feel that PoF is a game you can really explore in depth, and there's much more to the game than what first meets the eye. It's a good game, but I do think the game shows sign og age and I have to say that there are many other eurogames, even eurogames with auctions, which I would rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only 7 auctions (with automatic 100 florin bid increments) and 14 actions (buy something or produce a work). Every purchase or action is crucial. Advice for the auctions: get a builder early on, get at least one jester, get a recruitment card, get at least one prestige card, don't spend too much doing all of this! A very solid euro design.

RATING: 10
For me, this is a great game.  I find that the theme marries superbly with the gameplay and I like the idea of attracting various artisans and scholars to my Palace where I can inspire them to produce great works by providing appropriate surroundings.  There are a number of different ways to win, you have to be careful with your money and the auction round is normally a tense affair.  All in all, a game I can see myself playing for years to come.

This game is 15 years old and still going strong.  Played recently and lost a brilliantly tense 5 player game by 200 money on a tiebreak.  Still my favourite game.

Great auction game for a higher player count. This game took forever for me to get out and play. The components and box look so boring, and I love dry euros, but after my first play I am amazed. The gameplay is simple but highly strategic. Most of the game is based around the auction round that has lots of tension. A great all around game.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Not much variation from game to game, but there is a little bit with the setup of your board and how your opponents will bid for various items.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. A lot of decisions each turn that are fun and affect your score tremendously especially figuring out how much to pay for items.

3) Player interaction:  A good bit of interaction through auctioning and the different works of art and what order players put them out in.

4) Components/artwork:  Very nice looking components. The style of artwork is unique and neat to look at.

5) Game length/complexity: Good, short game that is not too hard to teach to new players, but still provides a great amount of choices.

There are several fun mechanisms in this game, and there is very little luck.

RATING: 7
Princes of Florence is a perfect example of a game that I respect but that I don't need to own. The mechanics are incredibly tight, every game I've played has been challenging, the auctions do a great job of balancing out people's needs and allowing for some interaction... I respect the game.

However, something is missing in this game that keeps me from really embracing it. It is [i]so[/i] precise with its actions, so calculating that I can't say I have a lot of fun with the game. This is Euro "chin scratching," carefully calculating every move. Sometimes I'm up for a game of that nature, but I have some of those in my collection already.

I won't turn down a game, but I got the sense this game would sit on my shelf unplayed. Off to the trade heap it went!

RATING: 6
The first thing that struck me was the beauty of this game, especially the writing.  The second thing that struck me was the Tetris-esque style of the buildings and landscapes.

I'm not sure why, but I'm not very impressed by this game.  (Maybe a letdown after I heard so many good things about it?)  It could be because there's little player interaction--but Goa is similar in that respect, and I enjoy Goa more.

And my trek back through those that came before reveals yet another absolute gem. This game has it all. Auctions, Puzzling, City Building, and that Agricola-esque feel of "Oh god I have so much to do and I'm running out of time".

Rating reduced to 8. Still a great game, but with less than 5 players, the auction is a little broken and boring. Even the variants didn't really fix the problem.

Traded away. Even if I have 5 players available, this likely wouldn't win the nod. Sad, but oh well.

Thoroughly enjoyable game.  The theme is very rich, and struggles can be very tense.  Greatly enjoy the five player experience, the three player game less so.  This is one of the best euros I have played and certainly one of a short list of keepers.  This is certainly not multi-player solitaire, as has been suggested.  Experience is rewarded here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A really solid auction game that is not solely driven by the auction mechanic.  The space management and ressource (money and cards) management, while light, is also really well implemented in the game.  The job mechanic seems to be a little force out and the concept doesn't translate very well in the theme, but the theme is still really good, especially for a Euro game.

The game plays differently depending the number of players there is as availability of ressources change.  

Plays a lot better at 5 players, is still quite good at 4 but seems to be less enjoyable at 3 players.  I would not recommend playing with 2 players.

Just an all around terrific game.  A bit more luck then Puerto Rico, but not enough to tip the game to anyone.  (Drawing five cards and choosing the one you want helps keep balance too.)  Some down time, but not enough to bog the game down at all.  A very clever game that keeps your mind humming the whole way through.

The two player rules are adequate for a good taste of the game.  The auctions are not as tense as a multi-player, but the game is no less interesting.

One of my all time favorites.  Planning ahead plays a big roll in this game.  You have to know what your last two actions of the game will be by the end of the second round or your toast.  Add to that trying to get what you need in the auctions and still have money to buy things in the action rounds.  A true brain burner.  I simply love it.

Wow! I find the complaints about "multiplayer solitaire" to be way off the mark. Its essential to pay attention to what your opponents are doing, and ascertain their objectives if you can. If you ignore that aspect, the game loses a lot and I can see where those comments would come from. 

This game has a very 'clean' feeling to it.  The more time goes by, the more I find myself wanting to play it.

My groups first 'heavy' game, and thus we played this one into the ground. Great game of move management and long term planning; with dedicated play auctions become interesting punch - counter punch affairs with plenty of red herring bids and intrigue afoot.  Though the game can become formulaic with such extreme dedication (never kept track, but we easily played this 50-75 times, if not more, as we often played sessions of 5+ games in a row...) it still holds a fascination and I always want to pull it out when 4 or 5 players are available. The only minor knock on this title is that to really work, like all auction games with these kind of dynamics, it requires a group of semi-equal experience, if the other players aren't aware of what items are worth then auction results can get skewed and things can get a tad out of hand. Easy to solve issue though, just play it more :-)

I might add that the reason this game stands out for me is the fact that it is almost a purely strategic game, as opposed to the more standard tactical fare that one expects from Euro games. While there is a measure of tactical response (i.e.: jacking an auction, discarding one avenue for another when the auction goes awry or the cards come up which force one to) but the game still is largely about properly assessing one's opening hand, and then coming up with a strategy for using that hand as effectively as possible. This really is a top tier game, and is still my favourite pure Euro style game going. A fantastic title that I still want to play every game night.

There was a time when I loved this game...but after a while, the strategies become repetitive and the game turns out to be little more than an efficiency exercise with the only player interaction being auctions.  I'm really sick of the "5 players but only 4 items" type of interaction that seems to be popular with Euro designers.  It's a shame that the game becomes so dull and offers little actual depth because it's a fun theme and it looks great.  I guess it might be deep and rich to someone who plays Ticket to Ride regularly, but for someone like me that grew up playing Civilization it just isn't.  Not a bad Euro overall- I do like the building of the Villa and some of the decisions regarding which works to go after are compelling, but I'll likely never play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like the building aspects. I am not sure I agree with the opinion that there is not enough player interaction. The interaction comes down to bidding on the same items. However this is seen in a lot of games (Medici, Ra, Modern Art, Traumfabrik and I like all those games). I would also add I may have had so much fun building my production empire that I wouldn't have noticed, at least for a while, if everyone hadn't made such a point of it. It's like a good Sci-Fi that someone ruins because they point out the impossibilities in the plot before you see it. I'm thinking of the Minority Report. Watch the movie and if you don't get it drop me a e-mail.

Solid euro with an auction mechanic. Low on interaction, and unforgiving if you make a mistake. This game is all about forward planning, and you can leave yourself short if you don't plan very carefully.

Would play again, however there are better euro's out there that I would rather play.

Just have to LOVE this game.  After a while, you realize this game is all about making sure you don't make a critical error in the auctions.  Between experienced players, the early rounds tend to be little exchanges of jabs in preparation for the big rounds at the end.  Usually there's on knock-out punch where one player makes the decisive move, but no one really minds because the game is all about setting yourself up for it.  Very good stuff!

The more I play it the more I get into the game. Though not really interactive it is usually a close game and from my experience ALWAYS comes down to the last round to see who will win. No runaway leader here. You have to really do a fair amount of planning early to win.

RATING: 9
Die Fürsten von Florenz is one of the few games where I absolutely don't mind the auctioning mechanism. This is probably because the auctions have very strict rules with given starting prices and increments. Also eventually each player will get one (and only one) item from each auction. And since Die Fürsten von Florenz is a game of continuous shortage situations, everything you manage to get your hand on will probably be of value. Usually I also don't like games where you constantly want to do three times as much as you are allowed to. But for some reason this also works very well in Die Fürsten von Florenz. While there are many different options of what to go for, it's usually pretty easy to figure out the pros and cons of each option as well as its ultimate worth in victory points. The game feels very balanced except for the jester tiles which are very powerful. Of course this can easily be compensated by higher auction bids as long as all of the players are aware of the problem. So most of the time there's not only the bad feeling of "I haven't done enough" but also the good feeling of "I probably did the best thing to do with my limited capacities" making Die Fürsten von Florenz one of my all-time favourites. (This is for the alea (2000) edition.)

I just love this game.  Figuring out how to get everything you need with very limited resources and actions that you can take.  I also enjoy the bidding portion where you can try and get others out of the bids by offering things you know they want so that you can go for a cheaper item yourself.

RATING: 6
I have played about a dozen games to date at all players numbers, but the game simply refuses to ignite the spark of the gun powder keg, and I have no idea why. When I first bought the game, I had to make do with the Alea-edition, which  like every Alea-game is bland and not printed on very 'playable' material. The recent re-release by QWG—for which I provided the Dutch rules translation—makes the material more pleasant to handle, although there are still some minor usability issues. Of course there is more to the game than just artistic design, but the more I play it, the more I am convinced the concept of 'prestige' is something which does not easily translate into an exciting subject. It is quite abstracted and quantified, which is sort-of at odds with the entire meaning of the word 'prestige'. It pushes PoF's underlying mechanisms (auctioning, actions) closer towards the limelight than I would like. 

Not that the game is in any way 'bad'. It is a tight affair, victories can be close, there is some tension in how to play the psychological game of picking an object you don't really want but someone else might removing that player as a competitor for your 'true' auction, and I can recognise that there are multiple strategies you can attempt—as with any good game I'm 'noticing' these on my own. Game-technically, there isn't that much wrong apart from relatively long player downtime in the 5-player version.

But it simply refuses to appeal to me. I prefer the rock'n'roll of Goa, which is just as artificial, and probably weaker design-wise because of the perceived dominant expedition card-strategy (although I have yet to see that happen). My response is always 'meh', even if I win, and even if my winning was a tight long-term affair. And after playing all these games, I still don't know why. As a consequence I'm at a loss how to rate this game. How does one arrive at a number when one is able to clearly recognise the game's good design qualities, but not able to derive enjoyment from playing ...? 

In other words: take the rate with a grain of salt.

RATING: 8
Very cool, clever game design.  Princes of Florence combines auction competition with a tug of war for completing a Palazzo build out and creating works which earn you prestige points.  The player dynamic of using your Florin (money) to buy Jesters, buildings, parks, and other things creates a struggle for getting the most bang for your buck while trying to make your opponents pay too much for the items they're interested in.  Additionally, a neat aspect of the game is how to fit buildings purchased on your Palazo.  Some creativity and spatial accumen is required.  The game flows well and is very solid.  I also like the aspect of the game which incites competition each turn among the players to build the best, most prestigious works.  This is a fun game.  My only negative is that after 20 or more plays, the games originality wears off and play feels like deja vu.  All in all - Princes of Florence is a good fun game worthy of space in one's game collection.

RATING: 9
A perennial favorite in our household, I think it offers a good mix of player interaction and advanced planning.  I would never turn down the chance to play this one.

Players must plan ahead carefully to figure out a combination of purchases and presentations over the course of 7 rounds.  With only a limited number of actions, watching a coveted item sell out or losing a crucial auction can be devastating.

The auction phase of this game isn't as important or intense as in other games (Modern Art, for example).  But this is still a game where you must pay attention to your opponents carefully.  The only negative I have about Princes is the significant downtime between turns; it's not uncommon for the smartphones to come out during slow periods.

I like it, but I don't love it. Puerto Rico has the "hook" of role selection, and at least feels more open-ended. With PoF, your early plays are pretty much Jesters or whatever your hand dictates. Middle turns, you add and guess to see if you can get the 3 point bonus. Late game you maybe squeak in a Bonus or Prestige card. Then the game ends and four players are within three points of each other. And the Tetris mini-game seems kind of out of place.

Interesting mechanics, quite simple rules, tough choices and not nearly enough time to do everything you like make for a really great game that probably deserves its spot in the BGG ranking. 

I only rate it a 7 just because it's really a bit too heavy/thinkey for me and one mistake can cost you the win. Definitely no casual game.

Really neat concepts here, but not interactive enough for me to want to play it more than every once in a while. (I'd imagine that the auctions could become quite tense/interesting if everyone playing had a very good idea of how much everything is worth, but until a play-group gets to that point...not so much. Particularly if there aren't very many players, in which case there's not as much conflict in who-wants-what.)

ETA: OK, it's not the lack of interactivity; I've since played far more indirectly-interactive games that I enjoyed a lot. Not sure why I'm less fond of this one, but I'm definitely lukewarm on it. Traded.

Production: Very thematic.  The script is a bit hard to read, but overall the game is pleasant to look at and the tiles combine to form a handsome city.  Play: I'm really up in the air about this one.  I'm definitely not having fun yet, but my two playings were years apart, so I'm basically back to knowing nothing about the value of items, and how best to use my actions.  I think that with more playings, and with players who are also learning the game, I might enjoy it more, but I wonder if I'll commit that amount of time to it, when I already enjoy so many other games.

It does have a sameness from game to game, so even though I like playing it Princes is better as an occasional game. Probably too convoluted for its own good.

It's hard to rate it properly after just one play, it being an auction game and all.  Seems very balanced, despite what strategy you go for.  Quite a bit of downtime for a Euro though, with all the analyzing optimal actions.  Typical of Kramer designs, it suffers from severe player-AP.

Edit: Another play about a year later, and I still maintain my rating of 6. Good game, but not one I am particularly engrossed in when playing. I'm sure I'm missing something in the valuation of items during the auction.F

The only part of the game I dislike is the spacial tile-laying aspect. It feels like more of a puzzle, and doesn't really belong in the game.

The game was pretty enjoyable overall. With 5P, we didn't realize that there would be a shortage of profession cards, so that was a killer for the people that didn't grab them early in the game and weren't able to build any works later in the game. For future plays, everyone at the table should be aware of that at the beginning of the game.

A good game, but didn't live up to some of the hype. The complaints about lack of interactivity are warranted: it certainly feels like you're playing with people not against them. Maybe this was just a case of over-inflated expectations.... I admire the design, but it just wasn't "fun." A polarizing game in some respects, and I fear I side with its detractors.

I really enjoy the moment when you realize that you and someone else need, absolutely have to have, the same thing at the same time to follow through on your strategies.  Really amazingly great game, that always produces a lovely tension of what to do with your precious few auction buys and actions.

This game had a good theme and nice components, but I did not like it at all.  Partly because the guy explaining it did not do a very good job, so I never knew what I was supposed to be doing, or how to accomplish it.  Partly because I lost.  Mostly, because I don't think it's very good.

One of the first heavy games that I had played. The theme is a bit nonsensical, but if you can live with that, there is a good game inside, mainly revolving around the auctions and playing some Tetris. There is not much room for changing strategies in the middle of the game, so you have to stick by your plan to the end, even if you can see it is leading you nowhere.

RATING: 7.5
This game was one of my personal favorites for about a year as we learned the different possible ways to win the game.  It is a great game that I highly recomend to anyone who is not familiar with it.  The following are the things that kept this game from getting a higher rating; It seems like there are only two viable paths to victory, the placing of buildings on the board is usually extraneous, and the game involves a lot of lower level math.  While I used to seek out the intensity of this type of game, I am getting more and more interested in some of the fun social games.  This one is everything but social.

I'm not sure what I love about this game.  Although it isn't a strong theme, I still get sucked into it because the gameplay is so good.  I can't say I'm as worried about everyone else as I am about my own game.

RATING: 8
My current rating is based on the fact that I just don't have many plays of this game in.  It's a REEEAAAALLLY good game (as my wife would say) and the mix of mechanics (bidding, building, the ever increasing minimum score value) really appeal to me.  The production values are great (so good that I bought this game based on the picture on the box - I just love me some bits! :) ).   Not many of my group is serious gamers and we all still enjoy this game, which I think says something about how a game can have great strategy and depth, have some learning hurdles, and still be appealing to people who not normally into games like that.  I think the main reason this doesn't get pulled out alot is because of the length of time it can take to play (analysis paralysis can be an issue with this game) and there is a tendency to draw games which play faster, allowing more games in an evening.

This game gives me a headache.... but in a good way. Lots of different things going on but they mesh together perfectly. When the last freedom of religion I so desperately needed was taken by the player on my right and I had to pay through the nose for a jester, I knew that the claims of multiplayer solitaire were BS.

For what it's worth, my first learning game was probably even more fun than my first games of Puerto Rico.

The game that got me hooked to bidding games would be this classic. First introduced to Kramer's games and was impressed with how the game combines puzzle fitting tiles with bidding mechanics. Perfectly executed and tight plays. The base game shines tremendously with the introduction of 6 expansion character cards (comes with the base game) which provides much more in-depth play without changing much of the base game. Definitely a win for me!

This was one of the first real games I played, and it has a special spot in 8 land as that game forever.  However, this has found new life as... a party game.  Absolutely a 9 as a party game.  Every work that someone plays has to be accompanied with a description as to what they made.  As an evening progresses they start tame (the Mathematician invents geometry so I can have round buildings that will fit on my play mat) go to silly (my Organ maker has a forest and no workshop, so he invents the pan flute) and if you are lucky one entry will go nuts (the Cartographer makes a map to the ancestral home of the Amazons where technology is found for women to overthrow the men of the world) and then every entry after that will be woven in to a grand communal story.  It's a whole nother game.

This game isn't that great with 3 player. Way too many auction options such that you never have to pay over the minimum.  I initially was going to rate it a 4, but thought I'd try it w/more players first to be fair.  It improves quite a bit with 5 players.  Update: I've played this several times now.  My final ratings.

Princes of Florence was the other "new to me" game that I played at OGA Con. We got a number of rules wrong and as a result the game essentially eliminated everyone but myself and Eric at one point. They lost the ability to continue to make works, and despite the fact that we let them go back and change a purchase so they could stay in the game, they did not do very well.

The game ended up going over pretty well with my weekend group, and we ended up playing it a handful of times. No one really loved it, however. While I appreciated its design, it did not thrill me, and I came to realize I did not particularly enjoy pure auction games. I like games that have auctions as their focus, but not if the auction is the game. (The one exception of this is Ra, which is an interesting enough game, despite essentially being an extended auction.)

Excellent game where players are patrons to the great minds of the Renaissance. They will produce great works for you, and increase your prestige, providing you can create the right environment to stimulate them. Incredibly tight game where you get 21 opportunities to create your environment and milk it for points.  Lots of different mechanics mesh elegantly here to provide a game where no one strategy dominates. A perfect Eurogame - flawless.

Played for the first time in December 2011, and it's a new favorite. The game has an aspect I love: the struggle to sequence your actions properly in order to get what you want accomplished, all the while being thwarted by both the game as well as the other players. Awesome game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have to give it a 10, even though it has auctions, which I generally dislike.  I think it's the fact that there are always attractive alternatives if you can't afford your first choice-- it's usually not a catastrophe if you are out-bid for something you really had your eye on.  Ironically, I vastly prefer this game to Puerto Rico, which has no auctions.

I really enjoy this game on many levels. Theme, artwork, and mechanics are all great. The more games I play by Wolfgang Kramer the more impressed I am.  Definitely my favourite designer. This also seems like a game with enough depth that my skill will have room to grow.  The only downside is that this game is tricky to introduce to new players, for 2 reasons.  First, there is something slightly unintuitive about how works are completed and scored (this certainly makes this game feel a bit different than other Kramer games). Secondly, experienced players have a serious advantage over new players because they will be familiar with the approximate values of the different auction items. To me the ease of introducing a game to new players is an important feature so this accessibility issue is the only thing holding me back from rating this higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great little auction game... I'm not convinced that the 'multiplayer solitare' are justified, but I've only played once. The auctions have another great twist in that you can nominate things you don't want and hope others bid on them to reduce the pool of bidders. Lots of neat interactions waiting for works to be played so you can recruit the artists, too. A few too many moving parts for something that is pretty simple, IMHO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I liked it. Some interesting decisions and many different strategies to choose from. In a lot of ways it is an optimization game. The actual gameplay feels similiar to Puerto Rico - very elegant and unobtrusive. The bits are great as well. I think the lack of player interaction is why I wouldn't rate it higher or necessarily suggest it. Also like Puerto Rico, I believe the game experience depends a lot on the frequency of play. If this sees the table regularly with the same group, I'm sure it would be more fun.

At its heart, it is an auction game whereby the players are bidding for pieces to put on their own individual board, and then playing cards that score points based on the pieces you've acquired.   The Tetris-like puzzle aspect of the game is a bit odd because it seems separated from what's really going on.  The auction rules are unique, and this is clearly a game from a time when auctions were done in interesting ways.  The game has very low interaction, but it does have long-term planning which some people may enjoy.

Compares well with the more popular "Puerto Rico" and utilizes the same "everyone plays their own board" format.  However, also uses an auction round to increase interaction and allows you (and your opponents) to mess up the best laid plans of mice and men.

I fell in love with this game after the very first play and picked it up for myself very soon after. I've played the game several times, but I feel like I still have a long way to go before exhausting all possible strategies. This is a very deep game and sometimes I even feel a little lost as far as strategy goes, but I still enjoy it every play. And there is just something too cool about placing your buildings efficiently in your plaza. I recommend it highly, but it may be too abstract for some.

It's a nifty design that doesn't seem to get much play anymore.  I suspect the old-timers have gotten tired of it, and it's not flashy enough to attract new players.  This isn't a very forgiving game: it's tight and relies on the auction system for balance.  Having a feel for the relative values of things is critical.  There are tense choices as you try and make the most out of every work, fight for most impressive, then have to decide how many of the points you just earned to convert back into cash for future expansion.  If you screw up, you could really shoot yourself in the foot, or give another player a huge advantage.  
The only things I don't really care for are some of the balancing aspects.  It doesn't seem to me that some of the routes are really viable (don't think I've ever seen someone get 3 builders, for ex.  Just not worth it.)  I'm also concerned about how much of the game is determined by the quality of your opening hand, and how many of the requirements dovetail.  Of course, you can always buy the cards that let you re-use other players' luminaries, but not until later in the game, and someone who has everything line up perfectly will still have an advantage.

Egyik kedvenc szerző párosom, és kiváló e munkájuk. Jól tervezhető, több lehetséges jó stratégia, és a múzsa kiegészítővel még jobb. Kiemelkedő játék, közel a 10-es nálam.Fix kör szám, és h éppen mikor mit és merre....hm, nem egyszerű döntések, és persze nem árt ha a spec lapokkal extrákat szerez az ember, így akár utolsókból első felé is mehet az ember. NA és persze sajnos nyelvfüggő, de miután megcsináltam a kártyákat magyarul, ez a kis hibája megszűnt. :-)
Update: továbbra is jó. Nagyot hibázni nem nagyon lehet benne, kicsit azt talán. A nagyot bünteti. Ma pl gyakorlatilag 3 körre "kizártam" magam a játékból, hisz megvettem egy olyan karaktert a maradék pénzemen, amit aztán nem tudtam felhasználni, s így miután alternatíva sem volt -teljesen rossz döntés volt,  egy sokkal előbb már elvetett stratégia szerint lett volna úgy értelme, és így már nem álltak a feltételek- ezért a következő 2-3 körben nem tudtam semmi nagyot alkotni, és a végén ugyan vmit sikerült elérnem, de ez csak a 3. helyhez lett elég, 2 ponttal lemaradva a 2.tól. Szóval ekkora hiba nem fér bele. Ugyanakkor ha nem teljes sületlenséget csinál az ember, akkor van esélye a maga javára fordítani a kis hibát a játékosnak, és javítani. Alternatívák vannak, csak figyelni kell, és nem kihagyni. 
Ugyanakkor elégedett vagyok: legutóbb tök utolsó voltam, csúnyán lemaradva, javuló tendencia.

Princes of Florence is an excellent game. Princes of Florence is the type of game which the more you play, the more you appreciate it...I know I did. :)

The last few times I played Princes of Florence was at Paul's monthly meeting in Laval. I am on a winning streak at the moment.

I haven't played Princes of Florence a whole lot lately, though a couple times more than Puerto Rico.

Something that I enjoy in Princes of Florence more now than I did at the begining is the auctions. What to get in each round and for how much ? Will the other players going to let what you want ? The game has grown on me with more plays.

Some of the items are worth more than others in general. What other people needs can drive the auction high if another person wants the same thing in the same round.

You need to be careful with your money. Sure hate when it happens when you need that 100 or 200 extra to get what you want. It can make a difference if you are tight on money and have no builder.

I can see how this could become multiplayer solitaire with fewer players, but with a full complement it has sufficient player interaction for me.

Takes way too long with newbs. The downtime is bad enough with experienced players. Downgraded to 8.

Might not be the best for newer players, because mistakes made early in game may determine your success for the whole game. Also, people not familiar to tetris might have problems :D.

Predetermined number of turns, in combination with bidding might result in some really odd situations - like worse player outbidding best player deliberatly. This is the sole reason why it is 9, and not 10.

This game will remind you of a lot of other games, only Princes of Florence probably did it first. Buy stuff in an auction, put it together in interesting ways and score points. The challenge is to have the stuff fit together in multiple interesting ways to be extra efficient.

My one issue with this game is that the endgame falls prey to the Power Card Syndrome, where large amounts of points get handed out to the lucky players that can cash in their bonus points cards, so you could just get a few points or a lot, depending on which cards you picked.

A very cleverly designed classic. There are many of my favorite things present: auction, building something, tile placement, set collection... I really like the tile placement puzzle part of the game, as it's very meaningful due to the mechanics hidden behind it. 

Maybe this is best with 4 or 5 players because the auction phase is quite light with 3 players. But I have liked this with 3 players too. Personal game boards are very informative and I have to say that the rulebook is definitely well made!

A walk across a tightrope while juggling. Many options, complicated but very thematic and easy to follow once you start playing. One spends most of the game one mistake away from doom, but winning or doing well is very satisfying. My favorite game.

RATING: 7.5
One of the first complex Euros I played that still gets high marks after repeated play.  There's a nice balance of long-term strategy and tactics; the auction phase is full of unpredictability forcing players to make serious adjustments along the way.  I'm always left with the feeling that I could have played a much better game (my weakness is not using bonus cards wisely).

A brilliant medium-heavy euro. With experienced players the pace of this game is very satisfying. With new players it can be painfully slow. Player interaction is direct in the auction round and very indirect in the action round. But paying attention to your opponents actions is critical to the timing of your own actions. There are a variety of winning strategies and executing them well is where the satisfaction lies.

Es un muy buen juego y lo principal es que no es muy complicado y eso permitirá jugar a gran parte de la familia y amigos siempre que les guste un poquito jugar.
Una de las claves de éste juego es intentar comprar los bufones en la primera ronda o la segunda. Las cartas de prestigio también están bien. Y sobretodo hay que tener un poco de suerte en que te toquen personajes que tengan alguna característica en común.
Bueno, sencillo y con diversas opciones de juego.

This game says a lot about me and the hobby.   Doesn't feel like a Kramer game - which makes it my least favorite of his, but nearly BGG's favorite.  Control instead of chaos.  Analysis instead of intuitive adjustment.

I think my rating could rise with more plays, as I can appreciate the strategic heft, but I so far find the game sterile and not worth its fiddliness.  The Tetris aspect of this game is disturbingly ludicrous.  "Sorrys, we's only build the Concert Halls whats are shaped like l's"

Having played with a crowd that wasn't necessarily sober, you would think that I was destined for a disaster, but this game is so well developed that you can't help but have fun. It took a couple rounds to get everybody into it...in fact, my girlfriend started out hating it...but by the end, everyone was having a good time and even though I didn't win (due to me misreading the victory conditions on one of my prestige cards) I really loved the entire system. I suspect I'll bring this game out a lot more in the future. There is some down time when you're waiting for everyone else to take their actions, but it's not a big deal.

(2-5 players) Two plays, second better than the first. Good choices on your turn and you have to pay attention throughout the game to make sure you can keep up with fixed bonuses for building better and better works. The only part that feels awkward to me is the final work that you just cash in entirely for points. Seems like the folks who have the best fixed bonuses will usually rocket way up in score at the end.  Unfortunately the text on everything in the game is in some horrible font (small and script) and it makes reading a challenge.

I admire the design and find it a fascinating puzzle figuring out how to use your way too few turns and how to fight out the auctions. But to do well you really do *not* need to look at what other players have laid out in front of them, so the interaction is quite slim. Despite this, it's stood the test of time and is still fun to bring out, so I've upped my rating to 9.

I played this when it came out 4 years ago and again today. I recalled the building process but forgot the complex scoring mechanisms. Blimey it was hard work.

If you like Alea games,  you'll like this, not heavy, but a strain on my brain.

Princes of Florence is a brilliant masterpiece!  With so many choices to consider, this game is one title that is worthy of a purchase sight unseen.

I personally enjoy this game whenever I play it, though it often comes off as a bit dry to others, I feel.  The whole "building the perfect garden to entice scientists" thing comes off a little bit strange, and the cards representing the works of art/science that you are sponsoring do little to convey the beauty of the imagined product, I'll admit.  Nonetheless, there is some solid gaming to be found here.

This is an excellent game, however not my favorite type of game.  I've thoroughly enjoyed my 2 plays, it's very tight, I made lots of mistakes and things I would do differently, and will likely continue making mistakes like this for several games to come.  I suppose it's part of what makes it interesting.  The slight bit of chance that comes with the initial professions annoys me somewhat.  I don't mind a bit of chance in games, but here it bothers me because it can give a good advantage to a player who gets 2 professions with the same building.

* Played 15+ times. Heavy strategy. So many different strategies can win you the game, and the game makes you feel like you are always on the verge of losing everything until you find the right combo at the last second. Great stomach churner. For 3 players, use one of the 3 player variants to make the auction tighter, and more interesting. Only down side is that it is mechanic-driven and not a heavily theme-driven game. THIS GAME NEEDS 5 PLAYERS FOR BEST EXPERIENCE.

This game sat on the shelf for two years but after finally playing it I can see that it's going to be a favorite.  Not as heavy as I thought it would be and I like the quick pace of the game, 7 turns is just right.  The theme is great and the landscape player mats allow you to enjoy building up without being messed with.  After playing so many worker placement and engine building games lately this game is a nice change of pace.  I'm a noob at this game but I'm a big fan, it's up there with the best of the classic German games that I've played.

RATING: 8
This is very standard Euro, but the unequal valuations of each item up for auction and the tension of best work along with minimum work value increasing each round is really fun and what makes it a classic.  People frequently describe this game as multiplayer solitaire, but I always notice a lot of aggression in the auctions because everyone is always jockeying for best work.  Very enjoyable.

RATING: 10
[Auction/Action, Planning, Art/Renaissance] {3P:9, 4P:10, 5P:10} This is my favorite German game. The Princes of Florence is a beautiful and elegant Kramer/Ulrich masterpiece. Its design incorporates strategy, multiple roads to victory and a fun and immersive theme. The game itself is a wonderful sight to behold, done in the style of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks and drawings. Outside of its outstanding auction, interaction between players is subtle but as effective as direct conflict. The game works well for all three player configurations. The five-player game is an exercise in dealing with great demand for scarce resources; it is tight and exciting. The four player game is an exercise in plan execution and adjustments; it is fast, fun and addictive. The three-player configuration is an exercise in economy and perfection; it is relaxing and enjoyable. Alas, The Princes of Florence cannot accomodate just two players, but that would be asking for too much. This game cannot be faulted; it is an amazing and exemplary design. ***UPDATE: Reaffirming my 10 rating, and deep appreciation of PoF. It's still the most elegant game I've laid hands, eyes and mind on. While I enjoy playing it online, the experience is diminished. Will suggest this game anytime, anywhere. *** UPDATE: I've written a strategy article. I've played close to a hundred games online. I've played a couple dozen games F2F. I've played three games in a row both F2F AND online. And I still want to play this game more. It's the first game I look for on BSW. It's the first game I suggest on game night, unless there's a new game begging to be tried. If there's a better Eurogame than The Princes of Florence, it hasn't been made yet. Exquisite. *** UPDATE: Will acquire new Quined multi-language edition as backup copy. My alea edition is pretty banged up after so many plays, with many more to come. Was going to get another alea, so might as well get a different edition of my only 10-rated Eurogame.

The more I play, the more I love this game! I just can't play this enough. The flow of this game is just beautiful and it scratches all the right Euro itches in such a short time. Too short.  

I don't think of this game as multi-player solitaire at all. The auction is crucial to victory, and you're always having to watch the work that other people are completing. There is a lot of tension and interaction. 

Tried it with a 2-player variant. The auction is certainly broken without more. I didn't mind it - (I'll play it solo if I could), but we'll probably never play it with just 2 again.

This is a great game, one of the best IMO, and certainly not the multi-player solitaire some say it is.  I'm not giving it a 10 yet, as it does seem to have enough downtime to make some people uncomfortable, and there's the minor grievance of the time it takes for the frequent practice of looking through 5 cards to pick the one you want.  After more plays, I may bump it the final notch.

This is one of my favorite games.  I really enjoy the strategic elements that come from the fixing length.  There are 7 auction phases and 14 actions to make the most points.  The components are of high quality, the flavor is good, and the rules are well laid with excellent summaries on the play mats.  The only downside is that interaction is rather low, the only time the other players matter directly is during the auction phase.

RATING: 9
This game does not have a significant learning curve (especially when compared to something like Tigris and Euphrates). People new to the game can fairly quickly grasp the concepts and understand why certain actions exist, so strategies start to develop early. Even though it takes a solid 20 minutes to explain the game, everyone can jump right in, and by the second game there will be no problems.

Even with only 14 actions and 7 auctions, this game offers tons of interesting decisions, especially in a 5-player game. The seamless blend of intense auctions, customizable individual player-boards, intuitive point conversions, and interesting player interactions/competitions combine to make a flat-out awesome game.

Megpróbálom tárgyilagosan értékelni a játékot és nem figyelembe venni az előkelő helyezését. Sajnos nekem nem igazán jött be, és nem teljesen értem ezt a jó pontszámot, de nem szeretném emiatt jobban lehúzni, mint amit érdemel. :)
Szóval ez valahogy egy tipikus "régi" gémer játék. Már megfigyeltem, hogy ezekkel gyakran nem vagyok kibékülve. A régebbi játékok sajátja szokott lenni valami elegáns, egyszerű központi mechanizmus. Na az itt nincs. Licitálás, akciózás, műkártyák. Ráadásul a pont/pénz osztás valami teljesen értelmetlenül van mindenhol leírva. Az egész egy zagyva saláta. Erre jön még rá, hogy ami a játék végi pontkülönbségeket hozza, azok pont olyan dolgok, amikre tökre nem vagy hatással. Képtelenség 5 főnél kitalálni, hogy éppen ki mire akar majd licitálni. Pedig a lényeg az lehetne, hogy úgy lavírozz, hogy neked mindig olyan dolog kelljen, ami a többieknek nem annyira. Mert vagyonokat fizetni szinte semmiért sincs értelme. 
Még tovább rontja a helyzetet a kártyahúzás randomja. Ha valaki az elején kap három egybevágó műkártyát, akkor elég nehéz lesz annak a dolga ellene, akinek három diszjunkt jutott. Erre jönnek még a presztízs kártyák, amiknek a céljai, pontozása valami teljesen értelmetlen. Az egyik 5 pontot ad, ha neked van a legtöbb parkot, a másik 8-at, ha mindenféle landscape-ed van. Node a többségre 5 főnél képtelenség számolni. Bármikor, bárki unalomból, csak a 3 pontért vesz egy akár második parkot is. A bónuszkártyák közül is van olyan, ami csupa egyforma dologra ad, ami nyilván nem éri meg amúgy más miatt, míg van olyan, ami csupa különbözőre, ami eleve adott általában. 

És mindezek tetejébe jön nehezen tolerálható holtidő (legalábbis 5 főnél). Az akciós köröket végigülni úgy, hogy semennyire se érdekel, hogy mit csinál a másik elég szenvedős. Pláne, mikor 5 kártyákból kell válogatni, meg 5 perceket gondolkodni a pont/pénz elosztáson.

Összességében nagyon aránytalannak érzem a játékot. Bizonyos elemei erősen gémer irányba tolnák, de mások meg teljesen légbőlkapott értelmetlen randomot visznek bele. És ez az, ami valahogy a a fent említett "régi gémer" játékokra jellemző. Végül az egészet nyakon öntjük egy nagy adag holtidővel és kész is a Princes of Florence.

I really enjoy this game. I like the fixed time limit, and the certainty of moves for planning ahead. I'm pretty good at that, although you wouldn't know it from seeing other games with lots of plan-ahead. Plus the Tetrising - I've got skills there. I really don't like the expansion, though.

Tense game for 5 players.  Relatively easy game to teach. 

Played 2-player game with my 8-year old son with no problem.  2 player game is fast and loose - hardly any competition in the auction.  Not recommended for any kind of competitive play, but a quick and easy way to learn the rules.

PoF is a somewhat different auction game. The auctions are crucial and really the central part of the game, but they are very much a means to an end here. Somebody will always get something for cheap, and the remaining player actions can make quite a big splash, too.

Underneath it all, the game is very much strategic. While you can certainly play from turn to turn the need to create successful works (which is the main source of money and points) requires an efficiency that is possible only with long-term planning. By turn 2 or 3 (of 7) a game plan has formed, and from then on you'll try to make it reality.

Relatively underrated eurogame (not on ratings) that is not often mentioned by people at forums and so on. A very ellegant eurogame of auctions and hand management which shines with 4 or 5 players. The mechanic of tetris-like tile placement is quite curious. Awesome.

PRO - I think the mechanics work together well.  Winning auction items, placing them strategically, and then producing works is fun.  

CON - Never get to play with experienced players, however.  Always seems like a one and done with people.  They don't dislike it, but my other games seem to interest them more.  Probably a theme issue.

Haven't played it yet. I'm worried about what Tom Vasel said about it. Apparently the auctions are really important, and if you don't know what you're doing really well and you bid too much you'll put yourself out of the game. Auctions should be about competing against the other players and decision making, not about valuation (as long as the values aren't to-be-determined like in Modern Art).

Excellent game. I think it has advantages and disadvantages over Puerto Rico. Advantages are it is somewhat less dry and more fun, simpler and shorter.

The rating is based on playing in 3 using some of the suggested variants, could improve playing in 5.

Even though this game is over 15 years old it still feels fresh for a Euro. Standard auction mechanic, but the options of what you can buy and working to interconnect all of the pieces is a good deal of puzzle-ly fun.  The best part is the "points or money" mechanic, which works to keep the players in a very tight race.  The pace is a little choppy as players read over the cards they have the ability to take but the game plays out in the right amount of time.  Also, the additional spatial element of placing buildings is icing on the auction / points / income generating system.  All in all this is a classic game and deserving of its continued relevance in the BGG Top 100.

Interesting game, but I don't like the auctions. I never like auctions. It frustrates me that I can figure out what I want, plan to get it, and someone else can take it off me. Also, what is this game trying to be? An auction game, an economic game, or Tetris? I find that it goes in too many directions and takes too long, and just doesn't hold my interest. By the end I'm glad it's over.

Oft refered to as solitaire, and in many ways it is.  Yet there is still a quality to this game i can't quite put my finger on that makes it feel like so much more.  The auctions help significantly in the feel you are not playing alone.  Manipulate an auction just right and you can get exactly what you want and watch others pay through the nose.  Strangely I find the theme in Princes captures me, I do feel like a prince sitting over the development of a town.

Favorite game of 2000 and into 2001.  By the end of that point I'd burnt out on it, partly from the effect of uneven distribution of profession cards in the 5 player game.  I'd love to see a mini-expansion that added 4 more profession cards.  I've returned to the game again, recently, and rediscovered the fun of it.

It's o.k.  The game works best with a full complement of experienced players.  One weak player can cause the auction outcomes to be skewed - undervaluing or overvaluing an item without good reason.  Thie game is only an "8" with a group fo 4 or 5 experienced players.

After three plays I have fond memories of the Princes.  I like how people interact by bidding on the limited resources, and the space management aspect is cool too.  I did find that the rule book obstructed play early on, but once we were past it we all had fun with this game.  One other interesting twist is how players can choose to move back on the victory/prestige track to take in money, which practically prevents a deadlock of players having no money with which to make more money.

A wonderfully complex and rich game with many possible winning strategies.  It is incredible with 5 players, but still very fun with the 2-player variant available on BGG.  I can't see this game ever getting boring.  A 10/10 with 4 or 5 players, a 9/10 with 2 or 3.

XMAS 2005 present (7 of 10). Finally,  a play during a gameday with Joe Huber and group. A bit confusing to begin but I think that one game is sufficient to learn most of the rules.

My wife (in a 4 player game) still beat me though! Screwed up the rule about the florin payoff. It will be done right next time.

Very poorly designed game that relies on an auction system to balance costs.  Game doesn't scale well to multiple "thinking" players as you can easily perform exhaustive computations with what information is available on the table.  Being *allowed* to hide money is also a poor choice, as it is thick and not well-suited for hiding.

In the short-term, the game is difficult to understand and unintuitive.  Once this is overcome, the game is still annoying due to the laziness of execution in game design.

Highly not recommended due to arbitrary elements, such as not gaining bonuses for being a jack of all trades, and the pointless "minimum work-value" per round, which is almost never missed.  I had a good laugh trying to imagine a prince giving his patronage as much frustrating thought as a player does in this game.  Terrible.

[Original comment] An outstanding game. It is complex, but very playable, even with 5 players. The challenges of deciding what to do in the auctions, what to purchase, looking at both short and long-range goals, and evaluating what other players seem to be trying to accomplish make this an intense and satisfying game.

May 2009 -- We have not played this game in a long time, and I suspect it would take a while to get back to understanding the rules and strategies. Since we generally play games only with six players, I doubt we will bring this one out very often.

Please try this before you buy it.

I honestly don't see why people like this game so much.

1) It has absolutely no theme. In Puerto Rico, or Goa, or many other popular Euro games, I actually feel like I'm doing something related to the game theme.  This one in no way shape or form makes you feel like you are in medieval Florence.

2) The game play is frankly boring.  People take forever to squint at the details on everyone else's work cards to see if they want to steal them.  (Which doesn't really hurt the player being stolen from.) People take forever to place their buildings and such in their grids.  The auction phase is completely unexciting. Producing a work brings little satisfaction.

3) It has almost zero player interaction.  Some say "the interaction is subtle."  The auction and "competition" in this game is the least competitive I've ever seen in a highly rated game.  It is frankly a quiet, non-social game.

I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.  If you've never played this game, please try before you buy.

Interesting game of auctions, action points, and building your estate.  The components are nice and fit the them nicely.  Some complain about the font, but I didn't have any issues with it at all.  Others complain that it is too much like solitaire.  Half of the game is auctions and you have to keep tabs on what people want in addition to what you want.  You can mess with someone if you have an idea what they are going for, and they can easily mess with you.    This is a very impressive game with some good stuff to think about in it, but at the same time, it doesn't drag.  Definitely a worthy addition to the Alea line.

Another Kramer masterpiece. Sure it is not very replayable, sure it is a bit cold, but its rules are perfect and replayability is not a problem in medium-big collections like the average geek ones. This is probably one of the best auctions games I have ever played along with Ra and Goa. Princess and the Muse expansion adds nice options to the game and lately Im playing always with it because it introduces into the game new possibilities and adds replayability which is the only serious issue of the original design apart from scalability: a fantastic game when played by five, but not as good with less players. A clean and classic fashioned eurogame that after many years is still among the very best ranked games in the boardgamegeek.

After quite a few plays on BSW, I'm lowering my rating to 9.  Still a favorite and a great game, but after all those plays I've decided it's not quite as compelling as I initially thought.  Still, in my mind, one of the greats.

Lowered rating to 7 because I really don't have much desire to play this game anymore, though I recognize it as a great game.

I liked this game the one time I played it.  I picked it up from a friend when he was cleaning out his collection, so I am still reserving judgement/rating on it until I get a couple more plays.

Overall though, my guess is that I will find this to be a fun, enjoyable euro that gets on the table occasionally, but isn't a staple.  I'm certainly coming to it very late, relative to when it was fashionable, and it's mechanics are certainly present in other games I own so I don't know exactly where it will fit in.

First-play thoughts after a 3-player game:

PROS
1. I like the balance of player interaction with the auction phase and the personal development of the city-building/purchasing/scoring in the action phase. 
2. There seem to be interesting choices and variable paths to victory. 

CONS 
1. The game has an obnoxious number of parts. This makes set up a chore and players unfamiliar with the game will likely feel confused about what pieces or cards can be bid on in the auction phase and what pieces or cards can be bought in the action phase. It'd be nice to have the board extend to either side of the fame track with spots for these components to make it clearer. 
2. The art is a bit ugly and the font is annoying. The whole game could use a fresh coat of paint. 
3. The auction feels weak because the initial bet is set at 200 and subsequent bets can only be upped by 100. Maybe I'd change my opinion in a 5-player game.

OVERALL
I enjoyed my initial play of PoF but, in the future, I want to play it at 4 or 5 only.

Excellent and elegant strategy game with best auction implementation I have seen in strategy board games. Careful planning ahead and balanced play rewards you greatly and can lead to victory. Princes of Florence is a unique game, such auction and tile placement combination I haven't seen in any other board game. Works excellent with full amount of players - five players. With full amount of players recruiting cards raise in value much, however you still depend on your own plans. Much player interaction, much strategy decisions and I like the theme - renaissance works for nobles and art. Also this games looks great, but not exaggerated and overproduced as many other games today.

RATING: 7
My view of The Princes of Florence is that it's not quite as good as its reputation. While I admire the game's design, it does have a distinct "solitaire" feel that detracts from my overall enjoyment.  There's also an almost complete lack of tactics (as opposed to strategy), making the game less interesting and less surprising than I would like.

The game's decision points can be broken down into four areas: (1) the auction, which you could almost say "is" the game - certainly it's where the game is won or lost; (2) deciding how many florins to take late in the game; (3) plotting your future actions to ensure that you can accomplish your goals in time and to estimate how many discretionary actions you can spend; and (4) playing Tetris.

#1 and #2 are good stuff, but #3 makes me feel like I'm submitting a business plan or something, since it's a solitaire puzzle which my opponents cannot influence except to make me pay more for auctioned items.  I realize that this exacting planning is what many players love about the game.  I would enjoy The Princes of Florence more, though, if there were more wiggle room allowed in the planning.  I want to be able to adjust to my opponents or stay a bit flexible or fine tune or just have room for some tactical maneuvering.  The best low-luck, strategic multiplayer games allow this (Goa, Age of Steam, etc.) but The Princes of Florence does not.  #4, the Tetris minigame, annoys the hell out of me.  It's critically important to get right, but it seems alien to the rest of the game, like a tumor.  The importance of fitting everything into your palazzo exacerbates the rigidity of the game - the need to plan your whole course of action from the very first turns.  It introduces a huge penalty for players who want to adjust or fine-tune their plans mid-game.  Unless their plans involve building very few buildings, purchase of an inefficient second builder will probably be the penalty for changing your plan or for not having the foresight to have everything mapped out to a "T" from the start.  And I think that sucks.  The upshot of #3 and #4 is that I spend large chunks of the game feeling like an automaton executing my program.

Another unfortunate quality of the game is that it only works well with equally skilled players.  One clueless player will throw the whole thing out of whack.  (People lodge this complaint against Puerto Rico, and they're right, but I think it applies much more severely to The Princes of Florence.)  Finally, unless you have just the right group of people, the game has too much downtime for my taste.

So it probably sounds like I hate the game, but you can see from my rating that I do not.  The auctions (and planning for auctions) are good enough to override many of my other gripes, making The Princes of Florence a respectable "once or twice a year at most" game for me.  My rating is for the five-player game, which is the only configuration that I think is worth playing.  The market for the auctioned items is too loose with fewer players, as is the easy availability of professionals.

But all said and done I *always* have a great time playing.

Excellent and engaging. The limited interaction and somewhat "mechanical" progression of a player's moves is what prevents me from rating this an 8 or 9 (or, for that matter, from playing it that much any longer). Goa, which has a similar structure, has improved upon it by providing more diversity in the bidding round. Watch out for players who can plan every remaining move already before mid-game. Either you are skilled enough to counter this by denying them every opportunity in the bidding rounds, or you refuse to play the game to begin with! :-)

Auctions are not my favorite thing to start with. And something about this design was just anti-satisfying for me (the puzzle pieces which you don't get to fit together, the interchangeable freedoms, the arbitrary WV minimums for each round).

Like so many beloved-but-slightly-old modern games, I bet if I were locked in a room with it and some eager opponents, I would come to love it, but if my goal is to find the next game I'll love, I'd rather try something new than lock myself in a room with this one.

This is a great game. I know many say it is mostly a solitaire game, but I disagree. Your choices certainly affect other players, and knowing how much to pay for an item in auction can be crucial.

Far more options for strategy and far more ways to change tactics mid-stream.

Eurogame ambientado en la florencia del renacimiento. Somos principes en nuestro palacio y queremos que nuestro palacio sea el mas mejor del vecindario, asi que para ello requerimos a los mejores profesionales (pintores, musicos, etc) los cuales a su vez requieren la construccion de determinados edificios. 

En la practica esto se traduce en basicamente dos fases: una de subasta en la que tratamos de obtener determinados elementos, intentando obtener los que nosotros necesitamos o impedir que los rivales obtengan los propios, y otra de compra en la que adquirimos edificios, todo ello a su vez lo situaremos en nuestro tablero siguiendo determinadas reglas. Con los elementos obtenidos en ambas fases, podremos completar (o no) las cartas de profesionales que tenemos en mano, y en base a ello sumar puntos y obtener dinero para las proximas subastas y compras. 

Todo ello muy bien entrelazado. Y el tema, aunque pegado, casa bien con el desarrollo. 

Es un buen eurogame. Su mayor defecto es que no es visualmente notable (aunque cumple bien), y que requiere 5 jugadores para la mejor experiencia de juego (aunque es jugable para 3+)

Many years later and I still like this game. While I woudn't call it a favorite of mine anymore, I hope to get it to the table more often again.

The Jester still leaves a bad taste, as it's the most powerful single item, which is a shame. Sure, you can auction for it, too, to make it expensive, but that may backfire as well.

Have yet to play the expansions that come with this edition, but atleast the "Muse" one sounded really good. I hope to get more out of this game in the near future.

C'est un jeu d'opttimisation économique La partie des enchères est intéressante, cela amène de l'interraction entre les joueurs. Par contre, la partie la plus drainante est l'optimisation économique en ayant la possibilité de convertir son argent gagné en points de prestige lors de la réalisation des chef d'oeuvre Combien garde t'on en argent, combien met-on dans les points ? Avec l'argent restant combien pourront nous mettre aux enchères pour avoir des éléments manquants. C'est un jeu où chacun gère ses propres ressources, optimise son espace de bâtiments.

Great game, but almost no player interaction at all.  Other than the auction phase, which is pretty basic, you are just playing your own game and planning what you will do.   The lack of interaction is what really hurts this one.  Plus, If one person gets a lucky draw on profession cards, you may as well stop playing.  The bonus cards, builder, and prestige cards help to keep everyone in the game as even the folks who don't get exactly what they want have plenty of good options.  Money is pretty tight and overspending can really kill you as the money/VPs come from one source.  As a novice player, the jester strategy seemed overly strong, especially if you fish for the jester bonus cards.  I was initially going to rate this game higher, but the more I think about it, the more I think that it is just another solitaire / group circle jerk.  It is really good for what it is, but not good enough to be worth a higher rating.  Other than the auction phase its nothing more than a static optimization exercise, and between skilled players the entire game will be decided by card draws and how you do in the auctions, which is mostly luck since you can't evaluate how important certian things are for other players without seeing their hand.  The downtime also sucks.  Its a game where you find yourself constantly asking if it is your turn yet.  Fun to play once in a while, but not something I would play multiple times in a row.

RATING: 7
Princes of Florence is still new to me, so it may earn a higher rating in time.  I appreciate that it's not terribly confrontational, yet the auction makes player interaction pretty strong.  What holds me back from a better rating is that, despite a wide variety of choices available, in order to be competitive you can't reasonable make many of them.  In essence, you need to do a lot of works, and with only limited actions over the course of the game some large fraction of them are probably going to be drawing professions or doing the works.  Doesn't leave much room for creativity.  I'm hoping that more experience will show me the breadth of strategy that everyone says the game allows for.

Only one play, but I liked it a lot. I am very interested in playing again. I liked the many options, but the individual simplicity of each one.

However, I think I actually prefer the randomness that a game like Vegas Showdown affords, because it is so much less calculable.

RATING: 9
A fun and tense game where you have few actions available over the course of the whole game and everything you do needs to really count in order to have a chance of winning. Sometimes a lucky draw is extremely powerful and there is a little imbalance with the player positions (especially 2), but still a great game. Graphic design is not so hot, text is hard to read and the colors for each player are not distinct enough on the mats.

A good win in this game is more satisfying than any other game I can think of.  Much more than multi-player solitaire, this game demands tight resource management, long-term planning and a good ability of assessing the other players' plans and capabilities.

This is a bidding game, and suffers from two problems because of that:

1) It bogs down in calculations, both when you bid (because you need to calculate how much you need to spend in the next phase) and when you make works and choose how much money to take (because you need to calculate how much you need for bidding and spending next turn).

2) Inexperienced players who bid for things which won't help them can screw things up for other players who actually have a good strategy and know what they're doing.

But overall, this game can be fun, and is somewhat popular and understandable for newbies.  There is definitely a lot of strategy required to win the game, because you have to choose a path to minimize your resource conflicts with the other players.  The fact that there are multiple ways to win is a big plus.

Pretty good game which includes bidding, and where one needs to manage his actions and resources.

The "Tetris" approach to placing buildings is quite interesting, and players are more tempted to pick up a 2nd Engineer to allow adjacent placement, else one runs out of room very quickly!

Very touch decision between collecting money for your Works, or getting Victory Points!  If a player mis-manages his/her resources (money), he/she may take themselves right out of the game.  Thus, need to pre-plan their next move(s).

[Initial Impression: 8] 
I played this again recently after a long break, and was reminded how good it really is.  Some complain about low player interaction, but I think the auction phase of the game belies this experience.  The auctions are crucial in allowing you to complete works, and to play well you must bid against opponents even for items that you don't necessarily want - but an opponent, knowing this, might let you have that not-so-useful item, thus denying you what you really need. The mid-game to end-game can be extremely tense, as completed works score more and more points as the game goes on, and you need money less and less, so laggards can quickly catch up.  I love how you constantly have to trade off money for points, both of which you desperately need, and a lot of the fun comes from trying to work within the system to optimize your own scoring and money management - there's that reckoning at the end of the game where, regardless of who won, you realize that you frittered away precious points for money that you didn't need.  And you really feel disappointed in your planning if you are forced to trade back points for more money.  However, there's also a lot of second-guessing other players, trying to bid up the items they really want and to time playing certain works so that they don't have a good chance to recruit them. Much of the strategy comes in looking for those items that others are undervaluing, while trying not to undervalue items yourself.

3 - 5 players (best with 5)

This game has an auction mechanic where you add various things to your personal city district that will attract certain artisans and provide more points/money when they create a "work".  I have a bad habit of messing up the scoring/money system when I teach this game, which ruins the tension.  This game runs a little longer than I would like and it has a lot of downtime as you wait for others to do their turns and make decisions.  It is not a bad game, but there are so many other games I would rather play.

Princes of Florence is a classic Euro from Kramer & Ulrich which challenges players with a number of different activities, including auctions, limited actions, limited money, and space fitting, as well as card collection.

There are many paths to victory (points) but not all are equal. Creating works offers the greatest options: money or points. But building in your acreage gives points, and helps raise the minimum value for Works. Jesters also raise the min value for works, as do having several Professions (benefactor-sponsored artists and scientists).

But the designers cleverly created a scale to mimic an educated public which demands greater works as the game progresses, so that players have to improve their estates, grant new freedoms to the people, entertain them with Jesters, or seek other ways to improve the works to higher quality.

This costs money- and great works generate money, but they are also the single biggest source of PP, or victory points. Players must choose between refilling coffers and PP each time a work is produced. Choose too little money, and you will not win the auctions to improve your estate, choose too much and you will fall behind in the struggle to be the greatest dynasty of Florence.

When estates are improved, there are several rules which limit how buildings and landscapes are placed, leading to planning and space-filling strategy, and there is also the opportunity to purchase Prestige cards which grant extra PP at game end for fulfilling particular sets of conditions.

All of this adds up to a game which is in the Top 100, and previously Top 10- it's a classic game, which offers a lot to do in only 7 quick rounds.

This is a beautifully designed game, one which I can see myself playing and trying to master for a long time. There are several great mechanics -- bidding over useful items, trying to place buildings in a Tetris-like fashion, and choosing which 14 actions to take over the course of the game.

Very simple to learn, but difficult to master. This is a very well crafted game. It probably won't be long before I call it a 10.

For auction fans, this is a treat!

I love the tetris-style building placements and having your finances directly tied to your score. 

The game suffers from introduction syndrome, as many auction games do.  Once players learn what the relative worth is of the game elements, the real game can start.

A game that deserves a place in anyone's collection.

This is a near-perfect information game. It can be a brain-burner trying to optimize one's moves. And because of that, weaker players making sub-optimal moves can give the advantage to more experienced players. If players are equally matched, this plays almost like chess, where one mistake will cost a player the game. Initial rating '8'.

Update (06/09/09): 7 bidding turns and 14 actions. That's it. Try to squeeze out as many prestige points out of those 7 turns, while preventing your opponents from doing the same. Fascinating.

Update (09/22/09): Why I like this over chess is beyond me, given that they are both near-perfect/perfect information games, brain-burners, and punishing play. I suppose it is because of the variety of options, and deeply immersive play. Chess, in comparison, is a pure, classic abstract. I've played my share of chess in high school, but had moved on.

Update (01/02/11): Disturbing that one player has won issuing seven (7) works! Which means the others (including myself) let him get away with one too many profession cards, and allowing him to get two recruiting cards too cheaply. In this manner, several weak (and new) players could throw the game, similar to the right-weak-player-enabler in Puerto Rico.

Update (09/11/11): This has the table a lot more lately, and with good reason--it is a brilliant, "classic" Euro. While some gamers are occupied by the fad of the new, there are others that are going back and rediscovering what makes German games great. Thank goodness there was a reprint. Upping to a '9'.

Update (12/30/11) 5 plays: The player from 01/11 issued eight (8) works for a crushing win! With two weak players that didn't take advantage of buying professions early or bidding on recruiting cards allowed this player to run away with the game. Another example of weak player binding, similar to Puerto Rico, but it seems not dependent on turn order, but is dependent on number of weak players.

Update (01/02/12) 7 plays: Beat the player from 01/11 at his own game, issuing seven (7) works for 60 pts. Although he only issued five (5) works, combined with best-work bonuses, competitive bidding (making me pay dearly for recruiting and jokers), and one or two prestige cards, he was only 6 pts behind me! So, it is possible to do well with fewer works, but those works had better pay off big.

Update (03/09/12) 9 plays: This game feels and plays differently with 3 players versus 5. There's less checks-and-balances during bidding, and less competition for the profession cards (you could get too many and not be able to play them all, so don't get greedy). However, this does mean that one of the three freedoms may disappear within the first turn! This also means that the valuations for the jesters, builders, and recruiting cards are probably worth less than in a 5-player game, as it is very likely you'll get them cheaply, eventually. While I usually don't like efficiency games, I enjoy this one a lot, especially when approaching it from the 7x auctions, 14x actions perspective. It's holding at a '9'.

Update (10/20/12) 10 plays: Played with "The Muse and the Princess" expansion that came with the reprint, with 5-players. We all enjoyed the expansion tremendously, as it takes a game that we all felt was rather "solved" and scripted, and fixes the issues and opens it up completely in unimaginable ways. The landscapes and prestige cards were largely discounted relative to the power of the jesters and recruiting cards, but the expansion makes builders, landscapes, prestige and bonus cards more competitive. There is a second special auction after usual auction for objects, which involves recruiting special characters, each with special abilities:
1) The Banker gives 600+ florin and allows conversion of florin into PP at the end of the game.
2) The Cardinal gives three actions instead of the usual two.
3) The Merchant allows a player to buy an object after the auction for free, or advances PP depending on player ranking.
4) The Muse gives additional WV to [i]each[/i] work, equal to the current round number.
5) The Princess produces WV depending only on the number of landscapes (+3WV each), builders, buildings, and profession cards (+2WV each).
6) The Professor allows a player to acquire a prestige or bonus card for free.

Players bid on these characters by assigning bids on the spaces on the cards, ranging from 300 to 1500 florin, with the Banker being the exception whose bid spaces range from 0 to 500 florin. The bid mechanism is similar to Amun-Re, where if you are outbid, you are kicked off the character card, but you can rebid on the same character or switch to another. If the bid comes around to a player, and no one has outbid, that player can immediately get the character. This is similar to the cascading auction of 18XX.

Having these characters/abilities significantly changes the tried-and-true (and arguably boring) strategies, and breathes fresh air into the game. The game is a bit longer because of the additional auction rounds, but no one noticed the time going by, because it is now even more absorbing!

The relative value of each character changes throughout the 7 rounds, and also emphasizes having more cash on hand, especially for the last round. Normally, players are concerned about converting all their cash into PP, making sure to not have any cash left at the end of the game. However, now there is incentive to hoard cash for the final character auction, where a player can get locked out of a valuable character with a maximum, preemptive bid of 1500 florin!

The Banker now is a source of cash, while the trading PP for florin mechanism is removed. However, having him at the end of the game allows him to convert all of his florin into PP! For example, 1800 florin could become 9 PP!

The Cardinal gives an extra valuable action, meaning that players have more flexibility and time in setting up their infrastructures (in terms of getting bonus cards and buildings) to make very high WV work plays during the later rounds.

The Merchant adds a twist into the next object auction round, as the player could get the object for free. Thus, usually expensive objects, such as jokers, recruitment cards, and builders become somewhat discounted. If a player wins the Merchant with a 300 florin bid, he can then inflate the bidding for a joker next round, thereby making other players weary of overbidding.

The value of the Muse increases steadily throughout the game, adding 7WV to each work produced during the last round! Thus, bidding for this character is aggressive, meaning players will hoard at least 1500 florin to compete for this card.

The Princess incentivizes players to get more landscapes, so that a player could produce a work without using a valuable profession card. Buildings, builders, and profession cards help too, but bonus cards and jokers cannot be used. With the right initial plays, she can crank out a 7WV "work" during the first round without having to expend a valuable profession. Instead, you would have more time to set that profession up.

The Professor makes going after prestige cards worth it, since now you have the opportunity to get several prestige cards early in the game, and then set up your infrastructure to profit from it. In my first game, I quietly acquired an unheard of six cards, which became approximately 30 PP!

Playing PoF with this expansion is highly recommended. With it, this easily becomes a '10'. This is one of the best expansions for any game I have ever experienced. It makes a great game, even better, without significantly altering the play or adding additional rules complexity.

Neat game, cool mechanics, although I agree there isn't much player interaction (i.e., one can proceed with a pre-planned strategy without much interference).

It's a good game but I always feel like I didn't play it perfectly.  I think this is because I approach it wrong & want to build a Work on every turn without needing Jesters or bonuses, etc.  In a game with only 7 rounds & hardly any luck I feel that I should be able to play it better.  Despite my feelings of failure I usually do quite well.

Everyone I've introduced to it loves it & I'm keen to play with the expansion once the group knows it better.  Maybe then I can build more Works!!!

Update: With continued plays I think I am getting worse at this game!  Love it!  Also, I think I prefer it without the expansion but I'll give it another try - it didn't make the game feel as tight: no more "7 auctions, 14 actions, go!"  It becomes "14 auctions, 14-21 actions, you'll be alright".

One of the best games from the Alea line. That said, I'm not a great fan of auctions being used as a leveller between game choices of widely differing value. They only work when everyone at the table is aware of the value of a commodity, and when that's true the winning bid will fall within quite a small range. The player actions represent more of a puzzle, but there are plenty of paths to victory so you're rarely out of contention. It really needs all 5 players for the auction to work, but then you're struggling to get Profession Cards so I'm conflicted as to the optimum number of players. This is unquestionably a very clever game, but it's almost entirely abstract and mostly an optimisation puzzle with minimal interaction. I prefer the stronger theme to mechanism link of games like Puerto Rico, but you can't say this isn't worth playing.

A very dry, boring Euro with almost no interaction or tension. Really lacks the excitement factor.

RATING: 7
The auctions seem to be about making prices more difficult to predict rather than determining the market value of things.  There's a higher luck factor than the game's reputation would leave you to believe, but there are various ways to make up for it and very interesting decisions to be made. (5 plays)

RATING: 8
Fantastic bidding and play mechanic with little down time between turns.  Add in multiple ways to win and you have a clear winner.  All player interaction is through bidding only which may not be everyone's cup of tea but is not a big concern in groups that I play with.

Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it.

As an auction game it has no indication of the typical value of anything so you always feel you've paid too much or too little for something.  I'm sure with repeated playings a rich tapestry of possibilities emerges, but life's too short to bother looking for them in this game.  If I was stuck on a desert island with this game and 4 other people I'd play it, but I'd rather be rescued after the first day.

One of the first German games I played, The first game pulled out at NBG at St Andrews. I loved it and we all played it again the second week. I have introduced several people to German games by playing this timeless beauty. You can plan your tactics but if you get out foxed at the auction everything will be undone. Auction games are tough with my wife as she will not let go (most of the time) I always end up over paying for everything and sometimes get stuff I dont want when she hops out.

Not much interaction in this game, I dont like playing it often or with people who play it often, I dont like knowing or planning what I will do for the whole of the game right from the start. I prefer games that have a greater element of strategy reasponce. If I play this game rarely I find I like it - more often and I KNOW how to get my best score and that just isnt fun for me.

Gran bel gioco, che unisce meccaniche d’asta ad altre da gestionale, ad altre ancora da gioco di posizionamento. La fase d’asta è quella coinvolge maggiorente i giocatori, mentre quelle di acquisto e di posizionamento sono più di riflessione. Denaro e punti sono due facce della stessa medaglia, per cui vince chi riesce a massimizzare i propri soldi senza dissanguarsi nelle aste. Attenzione ai Jester, spesso fanno la differenza.

My second game of this was on March 25th, 2007.  It has been a long time since I played this and rememebered playing, liking it, and some of the cards and details, however didn't remember the strategy, and the mechanics.  The rules aren't so bad to pick up on, however with three kids running around I wasn't able to pay attention to the recap.  I enjoyed the game.  It seem to play rather quickly (we did have many distractions with the three kids mind you).  It has a good balance of strategy, game mechanics and luck, which means that it is deserving if a high rating.  I'd recommend playing this and giving it consideration into your regular game play selections.

I think of this game as the alternate to Vegas showdown.  I think that both of the games are great and will appeal to most audiences.  Also they are different enough that they are not the same game.  The themes also are not the only difference, though it might be a selling point depending on the group you are trying to persuade to play the game.

RATING: 4
Princes of Florence is your typical in-the-vein-of-Puerto-Rico style Euro with mechanics that must be studied and calculated instead of gingerly skipped around in.  It's extremely tough on newbies since some of the actions and auction items are worth far more than meets the eye on the first outing.  I generally don't like dry and uninteractive games like this where you can be totally hosed out of foward progress by an unforseen barrage of unanticipated variables.  Of course, I also didn't really get the whole point of the player boards for whatever they added exactly, but that's just me.  I was told I would hate it, so I can't say it failed my already lowered expectations...it just didn't dazzle them all that much.

I'd like to love this game, but there is something that I don't like about it - and I cannot put my finger on it. Perhaps it's the Tetris-ish aspect of placing buildings? I really don't know. I believe it is solid and interesting, but still, it doesn't get as much table time with me as it deserves.

Great game.  We've gotten a lot of play out of this one.  That being said, I could see where mixing experienced and new players in this game could be a challenge as it takes a play or two to understand the value of some improvements versus others.

Safety Tip:  Under no circumstances, let another player monopolize the jesters early in the game for cheap.

Took me forever to get this played.  Wasn't really worth it in the end.  I really didn't enjoy the auction where a couple items were obviously worth more... to everyone.  Just doesn't cut it for me.

Tetris... wasn't that important.

The building "path" might be interesting, but it didn't really add that much variety.

I did appreciate the idea that you need to be planning for your last turn *very* early, but it still just wasn't that cool.

The Princes of Florence has successfullly combined the theme and the game mechanics. Players take the role as a director to lead prestigious family in Florence at the age of the Renaissance. Gamers cultivate men of talent in various area, such as art, music, technics, and academic etc. Game participants cannot take their eyes off from the everchanging game circumstances. Not only offering various tactical options, but also the game provides dynamical challenges. Mainly based on strategy game mechanics, The Princes of Florence also includes auction and bidding system. The game has well balanced system both strategic and luck factors. This game is the best choice to fully enjoy Wolfgang Kramer and Richard Ulrich's masterpiece.

And purty.

With a very attractive theme and nice components this would be a good game to introduce to non-gamers, if it were not so involved. Few decisions are easy as there are numerous play options and every aspect of the game is interlinked. This means that you really have to plan carefully in order to maximise your scoring. However, interaction between the players is limited to the auction phase and to the competition to create the work with the highest value. After 10+ plays I've finally increased my rating to a 9. Princes of Florence starts to show its subtlety and balance when all players know the game well and can therefore execute strategies and refine their tactical play, while taking into account what the other players are doing.

Very good game, well balanced, and works equally well for 3,4 or 5. Have found one unbalancing feature, which is that (no matter how many play), the 7 rounds do not divide evenly - someone gets to play last more often, likewise to play first. This does not cause a problem - quite the reverse, as it adds an extra dimension to the game tactics.

Just great game - many decisions, several paths to choose from, a lot of optimization.  It's demanding and complex (though not in terms of rules).

Visibly better for 5 players -> more interaction, more tension, more fun...

EDIT: I'm beginning to worry that with 3 players only 1 viable strategy exists...  Another reason to play the game with 5.

Expansions (I own them as a part of the Polish edition):
- 'Princess & Muse' - adds more complexity and tough choices, but what's more important - ensures true replayability and prevents schematic, the only correct strategies.  I think it's a MUST for experienced players.
- 'Cooperative building' - cannot say anything as I haven't played it yet, but it's not so promising on paper

EDIT2: After 10+ plays (some with expansion) I can say I've seen enough.  The replayability becomes an issue.  I appreciate the design, I can occasionaly play it, but I don't have to own the game.

RATING: 10
Highly strategic with multiple paths to victory and very little luck, I love the fact that when you pick a card you pick up 5 cards and choose the one you want minimizing the luck. 

Similiar feel to GOA where you are auctioning for things to build your own board and everyone is fighting for the same things. One of the best auction and building games I've played and one that requires you to have a game long plan and adjust along the way, similiar to Taj in that way, another outstanding Euro.

The solitaire complaint here has a little validity as something like Leonardo has shown however the auctions are highly interactive/competitive between gamers and you need to keep your eye on the other players throughout. Fun in a competitive way and certainly a top-notch Gamer's game 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 9 => 9.5 (probably a 10, more games to confirm) Well, well, it was bound to happen. I mean it had a 9 rating for me all along as I immediately recognized the brilliance but POF was actually a slow burner for me as my desire to play has really increased the more I play it. I have seen multiple ways win this game and it's fun trying each one as you make a plan and 'hope' that the auctioning will go your way so you don't have to deviate too much or over spend to keep on track. This is really the challenge of the game as it pits you against your opponents directly in the auction and it is 'that challenge' that brings me back for more. 

Another beautifully crafted Euro that demands game-long planning and always plays tense and close between good gamers 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Finally rose to a 10 (My 3rd), the game starts becoming FUN actually in repeat playings with the same players. You get to know their 'tricks' and their limits and it is damn fun trying to push them over them or just plain try to get them off their game. The game itself is very unforgiving and beautifully balanced at the same time, the unforgiving part keeps you on the edge of your seat while trying to stay on course and still pick things up at the prices you want, TOUGH in the right crowd. I have to agree with John(verandi)on two good points here, the game can feel formulaic which is kinda good and maybe a little bad and that winning definitely "often comes down to the little things". Definitely a 5 player game, 4 is good but no where near as 5. On another note there are some very funny moments and comments made in the game when something goes way too cheap or you end up paying 800 for a bluddy park! 

KRAMER'S MASTER "WORK" & GERMAN GAMING PERFECTION 


[b]Princess and Muse expansion:[/b]

While POF signifies gaming perfection for gamers, and it is pretty hard to top perfection...this is a truly an excellent exp!  Princes is a 10 w/o the expansion however this not only gives the game TONS more replay value but also adds more to the already multiple paths, LOVE it with the only downside of it also adding a little length (maybe 20 to 25 minutes in a 5 player game).  

The new things to bid on in the second auction are really interesting and can help you where and when you really need it. The different abilities can influence how you shape your gameplan and really add to the things to think about here. While you could say the game is 'not as tight' as these do allow some flexibility, I have played several times and the endgame scores have been surprisingly pretty close just as in the regular game. 

There is a lot of leap frogging in this new Amun-re style auction where you bid on one item and can be outbid only here, you can rebid on the same item which is where it differs from the Amun-Re one.  One little negative is that not all items are good in all rounds but that makes those rounds really hard to get something so even more competitive where sometimes you just have to 'bid it up' and then possibly get stuck bowing out with nothing.  Awesome! 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Well the expansion really makes the game an 11 and would never play without it. After many plays though there is one "small" issue, could be group dependant not sure. You play 2.5 hours and in the very last auction, you have to "hope" to get what you need and not get screwed out of it by chance. Granted if you are watching everyone you can usually anticipate what they are going to do when experienced players but not all the time. So do you have to have a plan "B"? Yeah you can and I guess it mostly works. My thought is to just be able to buy what you want in the last auction only to reduce the chance effect. Just a thought I am toying with since I dont like surprise endings to long multiplayer strategy games. 

[u]Tidbit[/u] Like the blind auction variant for turn order, losers get the money back, bid for each seat. This means not getting the extra work in the 5 player game for "free".

It has some amount of solitaire play but I feel that the auction phase makes up for that. Anyhow, you need a little down time just to formulate your plan and decide on your next actions and auctions.

Just got in 2 plays, a 4er and a 5er. EXCELENT game. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is that it really can't be played to its full potential with less than 4, and at that it really should always be a 5 player game. I liked every aspect of this game, it's my kind of game. Lots of diffferent ways to play and win, some luck but mostly tough decisions. You commonly want to do 3 thing but only get 2 actions. You want multiple items in auction but can only get one. The challange that provides is exceptional. I REALLY enjoyed this game. It's along simaler lines as Puerto Rico and Goa.  ***JediMike***

The rules are very complex when reading and explaining them, but very simple once the first game is underway.  Strategy depends on card draws & bidding outcomes.  Prestiege cards make the ending a bit of a surprise sometimes.  Hard to come back from a large defecit.  Not much interaction between the players except for the auction.  But a solid game with multiple paths to victory.  I have bumped my rating from 7 to 8 after multiple plays.  I don't want to play this often, but I love it when it does get played.

Update:  Rated an 8.5 now, despite having not played it much in the past 2 years.  It's a classic that I always find myself in the mood for.

A very good building game. Played a game last night and had a bad starting hand. So I decided to play all my cards out early. I managed to pick up one more profession and one more recruiting card to play 6 works, but the early scores I obtained were still so low that I couldn't maintain my early lead and ended up tied for 3rd. Only 3vp from the leader though, it was a very tight game. I didn't present any works on the last round, indeed I didn't do anything, but pay a lot for a Prestige card. This was very in-efficient and cost me the game. I should have avoided playing a work earlier and built up a little more for better scores. It was good to present the first turn, since I was the only one who did and therefore got the 3 vp bonus, but on the second turn I should have held off and built up the components necessary for full works.

Long term planning (as in, have an outline for what you intend to do for the entire game from the very start) is mandatory, but you have to juggle things and adjust when the plan inevitably gets wrecked.

A great game. 

Pros:
Easy to setup
There is no best path to victory
The game components are top notch
Auctions can create some huge tension
One of the best games to play five player 

Cons:
Brand new players will probably get crushed on the
first few plays so it may be difficult to introduce. I would almost recommend giving new players some kind of advantage (such as an extra 1000 florin) to help ease them into the game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2008)

I was expecting so much from this famous game, that I can’t help to be a little disappointed it wasn’t fun enough for me.  I have not played it with 5, so there is still hope for the game (although I’m wary of the downtime). Right now I can say that the game is easy to teach, it has some interesting decisions in it, but it has some (unwanted) luck involved in the game with the professions and the prestige cards.

It is a good game, but I was expecting a GREAT game. The theme is very boring for me.

For now, I’m willing to play this again if a friend asks for it, but I don’t plan to pursue further plays, I just sold my copy of the game. If I want to play an Eurogame, I would play Agricola or may other game over this one.

Next to Traders of Genoa and Fifth Avenue,  this is one of my favourite in the alea 'big box' line.  Lots of different roads to victory make the auctions quite tense.  But beware... one or two newbies can completely throw off the game.  Everyone MUST have an idea what each item is worth, or the auctions will favour the experienced players.

The new version with revised components and variant rules have placed a 2nd copy on my wish list.

28.10.2009: I can certainly understand why some only play this with five, with three or four players the competition and tension is less than with five players. I did enjoy it with three and four players though. It has a bit too little and too indirect interaction for my liking, but since I've done reasonably well when playing it, I look past that. The rating has gone down a bit with more plays, but I still like the game and I think it's well made.  However, I don't need to own it.

RATING: 7
This is a tough one for me to rate. While I do appreciate the game as an excellent design and I would never turn down a game, there are a couple of elements that keep it from being one of my favorites. I just feel the game is too short and too much driven by my starting hand of professions. Most of my 7 auctions and 14 actions in the game are driven by what is on those first 3 cards. Certainly there is still room for some clever play, mostly in deciding what to collect early in the game versus late, but I still feel too anchored at times by the objects listed on those initial cards. 

Also, even though money is a large part of this game, the values, except for the auction, are all set, so rather than making evaluation decisions, you are mostly deciding how to divide income and points. While I appreciate this mechanic, it doesn't capture my imagination like really trying to set a value on something. Value is translated in this game into spacial terms (ie. a large building is more expensive because of the space it takes, not what it costs, but larger buildings also support more professions which increases their value - depending on your professions). To me, the professions in hand often take the work out of really having to value something. If its listed in your hand, its valuable to you, and in most cases you don't need to decide HOW valuable, because the price is set. Simple as that.

El juego consta de dos fases, una de subasta y otra de acciones. En la primera los jugadores pelean por 7 tipos de elementos y en la segunda aplican 2 de las 5 acciones disponibles. Los objetos conseguidos en la fase de subasta y algunos de los conseguidos en la fase de acción, pueden ser usados en esta última fase.

Además de estas dos fases, puedes añadir otra fase más ente ellas. En esta fase los jugadores pujan por personajes, cada uno con un poder diferente.

Hay otra opción extra, los jugadores pueden colaborar compartiendo edificios en sus tableros.

Es un buen juego,aunque creo que como mejor funciona es a 5, ya que con menos gente siempre hay objetos disponibles.

The game has two phases, an auction phase and an action phase. In the first one, players fight for the 7 different kind of elements and in the second one, they play 2 of the 5 available actions. In the second phase you can play some of the objects you got in the auction and in the action phase.

Besides these two phases, you can add another phase between them. In this phase players bid for characters, each one with different powers.

There is another extra option, players can cooperate sharing buildings in their boards.

It's a good game, but I think it does its best with 5 players, with less people there are always availabe objects.[/color]

Played 3 times with 5 and 3 times with 3 players. With 5 there is far more interaction, the downside being that the game can slow down. With three players it goes much faster, but then the solitary aspect of the game is perhaps too strong. I prefer to play with 5 players. This game is about maximizing your score, for which you need to plan several turns. That makes it a challenging but also a rewarding game (if your plan comes together, that is). Very newbie unfriendly though. (28 dec 06 after 6 plays)

Maybe would have it as a 10 a few years ago, but frankly this game -- while an excellent one -- has not maintained its excitement level for me as has Puerto Rico, which I view as pretty close to a perfect design.  One variant that has been suggested to balance things out in a five-player game:  switch the profession cards to the auction and the recruiting cards to the action phase -- assuring everyone in theory gets at least one recruiting card, and also it makes the auctions a bit more interesting.

Princes is nicely made and features an ecletic mechanism but there's something a little artificial about it.  I enjoy a game of PoF but rarely finish craving more immediately.

Update - Its actually a pretty dull game but it does play quite quickly.

[b]First Impression[/b] (3 plays, 9 rating): Wow, this one made a big splash. Some of the highest production values I've seen in any game. HUGE potential for creativity with emergent narratives. Stiff competition for resources. Lots of options. Even a small spatial element (a bit of tetris on your own board).  

[b]Revised comment[/b]: the imaginative episodes that come out of this game are, surprisingly, one of the strongest things about it, but the more you play it, the less you notice (because it's incidental narrative, not decision-driven narrative). Players will arrive at a point where it becomes a pretty blunt exercise: 7 auctions, 14 actions. Yes, it's all very slick and well put-together. Long-term strategy is paramount. Auctions are tough. The game just doesn't have a whole lot of [i]range[/i]. 

So: Precise, Challenging, Positional, Long-term, and ultimately Narrow, with a nifty representation of patronage that recedes into the background, since who-likes-what is so straightforward and who-works-alongside-who doesn't have any gameplay implications.

You are trying to fulfill one to three requirements of building, landscape, and freedom on profession cards to score points. Fulfilling more of the requirements gives a better score. Each round has an auction when you can buy things to help scoring, some examples being parks, lakes, and jesters. Then on your turn you can do various actions such as buy certain buildings, buy freedoms, or take new profession cards, or score the professions. As long as you meet the minimum score for the round, you collect cash when you score a profession or can take victory points instead. The minimum scores keep getting higher each round.

Beautiful bits, and a stunning design.  There are 21 things you can do in the game, 7 auctions and 14 actions, from these you must amass the most points.  It might seem that this game would be stagnated with AP, or crushed by optimizations, but there is enough luck to avoid these pitfalls.  In fact I think this game has the perfect balance of luck and strategy for a medium weight game.  Despite the rule book, this game is easy enough to teach others and great fun to play.

I like this game but have not had many chances to play it.  There's a great auction element to it and the theme is wonderful.  It's just hard to explain to new players so it never comes out.  It gets overshadowed by Power Grid, Puerto Rico and Railroad Tycoon now.

21/4/08 Just finished 4 straight games of Princes.  My evaluation has completely changed; I now rate this a 9 (it may almost be a 10 but will have to see how it holds up under repeated play).  The only drawback is that you are engaged in your own little world and there is very little interaction with the other players.  Other than that the mechanics are very very smooth.  The decisions are so varied; "oh, do I bid up the Jester to force the other player to take it for a high price, take my cheep forest/park/lake, or recruitment card so I can steel a work, go for prestige for some important bonus points, or take the builder for a monetary gain later in the game?  AND, if I don't take one of those, how will it affect me later?  It's brilliant!!  Over four consecutive games, the biggest point spread at the end was maybe 8 points from first to third place.  
   Things there is a real value in producing the highest WV work each turn for the oh so important 3 PP bonus.  Usually the points differences were excatly equal to the number of bonus points each player got.  As the game progressed the number of Jesters each player has equalizes so the only way to get the bonus 3PP is by taking bonus cards to increase the work value of a work.  Or have more profession/recruiting cards in your hand.  I love it!  This game will get many more plays now!

Princes of Florence is a very abstract, strategic game that mainly focusses on you and your tableau. There is an element of luck of the draw, and of course your opponents can have a large influence on the available item in the auction, so you'll have to be flexible. When that information is available, you can calculate a lot in this game. With experienced gamers this game can get very mathematical. The artwork of the latest QWG edition is very attractive, and the theme works for the game, although it isn't very attractive for new players. The beauty is in the efficiency engine.
UPDATE: I've decided to sell this game. It doesn't get played enough in my group, and some friends also own a copy. It hurts to part with this game, but it's definately for the best.

RATING: 8
15+  plays.

A game that has grown on me. This game is a classic, though I think it shows its age: compared to the best of the more recent Euro games, it plays a bit slow, and the theme is a bit stale. Down time can be long, and I think the play is too mathematically driven (if you had the resources, you could calculate the best play at any instant). Puerto Rico, while a very different game, is, I think, a good example of a game that came out of the next stage in the evolution of German game design. If you are new to Euro games, hold off on this one.

Update: this game is superb. Not as friendly as some of the others, however, as I've noted, which is why it only get's a rating of 8.

Princes of Florence was the last of the Alea/HiG Euro classics (Puerto Rico et al) from the turn of the century I got to play. 11 years later it still holds up with the new releases although it has a distinctive strategic old-school feel which is part of its charm. It reminded me of Louis XIV (which it predates) in its aim to complete works/missions in most turns. While Louis is the majority take on fulfilment services, PoF is auction-based. Every gamers' game can benefit from some auction and with PoF I'm glad to have a rock solid exponent in my Alea collection. Too bad, that it's the Pro Ludo second German edition which has inferior less functional artwork. It likely won't climb higher than a 7 as it's too strategic to fall within my more tactically focused comfort zone.

I must try the Princess & Muse expansion; it looks very intriguing!

**********************************************

The theme is very strong and the building/development aspect is compelling. However the game plays like a puzzle for me, and a fairly simple one at that. You only have 7 auctions acquisitions and 14 actions over the course of the entire game; how hard can it it be to figure out the optimal course of action? The counter-argument is that those 7 auctions are the core of the game and will make or break your run at the title. The problem is that by the second turn the players are headed down their own paths and there often isn't a whole lot of competition for the things you want. The drama level is surprisingly low. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice little game, but it gets my prize for most overrated game on the 'geek.

The "multiplayer solitaire" criticism doesn't bother me at all.  Like Puerto Rico, every time is different, but I also get into a rut sometimes.  I need to learn to take chances and try different strategies.  This is essentially a very simple game with straightforward rules.  The design is impressive because this simplicity still yields substantial depth.

RATING: 8
I'm not a fan of the new artwork, but probably more because I'm so used to the Alea version.

That said, I enjoy the Princess and Muse expansion, and look forward to trying the common building variant as well.  But the language is indeed a barrier and the enhanced graphics are not really a draw.

Unless the common building variant is really good, there's no reason to get the Pro Ludo version now that the Alea Treasure Chest is out.

Good Games, Artwork can get a little difficult after some plays and for new players. The small tiles do tend to shift and the card must be kept very steady. Overall a very unique game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Note: If you are playing 5 players, my rating is a 7. In every other case, its a really unbalanced game, and as such, my ratings are for this game as a whole.

An auction game where players attempt to collect prestige and build buildings on their playmat. Beautiful art and components (the old version). Unfortunately there isn't much else to this game. It IS pretty solitaire, but there is some nice tension in the auctioning and deciding how much money to claim when completing a work.

RATING: 7
Interesting game that is fairly well balanced, seeing how i screwed my self early on and was behind like 20 points and then at the end we were all within 5 points of each other. However, there is just something about it that i cant figure out  that keeps it from being great.

My favourite of the tough-choice auction genre of games; quite strategic, though it's not clear what's going on until the end. Well-presentted with a strong theme, if gthere is a weakness it's in the level of player interaction, but if that's true I've always enjoyed it too much to notice!

Most of the games I played, I can win easily by putting on 6+ works.  First the Jesters were undervalued, after that the recruitment cards are the most undervalued.  I would like to play a game with all players who see the value of putting as many works as possible.

So the game hasn't been a real challenge thus far.

A nice game of hard decisions, light auctioning and optimization. However, this is not as good as its reputation. Problems mainly arise from downtime and the possible limitations concerning different options at different stages of game. Also, the game doesn't allow even minor errors with a full crowd, especially if there are more experienced players around because it's too hard to screw other players.

Sometimes one plays a game and one is awestruck by the level of thought and commitment that the designer put into it. That is how I reacted to [i]The Princes of Florence[/i]. The game is so clever, so subtle, so delightful that Kramer must have loved doing it. It was a pleasure and an honour to play.

RATING: 8
This is a great game of long term planning with a tactical element brought in through auctions at the beginning of each of the seven rounds. The weakness of this game can be a bit of downtime while other players think through their turns. There is usually a lot to think about so you can plan ahead on others' turns.

Awful gaming experience for me.  I don't understand the popularity of this game.  The was no theme at all to this game.  A don't enjoy auction games.  Everyone focused on the jester.

Absolutely amazing game. The auction mechanics often leads to many interesting decisions and change of plans (ie: bluffing to raise the bid but yet unintentionally winning it and having to change your plans entirely). Turn order during auction is also something to take note when making decisions. Bluffing is possible especially when in control of deciding what to bid during the auction to clear off other potential competitors from the real intended item.

The action phase seems to be a bit more streamlined early game. I've found that taking work cards early on seems to be a standard play for the game. Despite of that, players will still have to make interesting and often hard decisions if they want to be above the rest in prestige points.

Plays better with more players.

RATING: 7
A very nice game. Suprising how much AP people have with this one. Second Time playing - lost horribly but learned a stategy for next time. Edit: tried strategy - got in second place by using using alot of profession cards, Upon Secon calculation I could have won very easily by changing stategies a bit. Next time to consider Prestige Cards. Edit: played with the new expansion - WOW I love this game - it really made the game better! Upgrade to a 10! It feels just right and with the beautiful art.. What more can I say! Update: The amount of time to play this game (2.5 - 3 hours) has lessened the playability of this game a tad. Heck, it borders on the TI time frame with the wrong players. Also with the introduction of In The Year Of The Dragon - a game with just as much stress but is faster = more fun in less time. Rerated to a 8.5 with the expansion. Update: I've had to reduce my rating again because of burn out. I can easily burn out on this one due to length of time vs fun vs type of depth I look for when I play longer games. The longer the game, the more dynamic I want it to be. It's a great game - just very quiet for 2.5 hours. According to the BGG scoring this is a 7 down from 8.5.

Just a very good game with the right amount of people.Even though MANY others say that it breaks down with 3, it still playes well enough to warrant this high a grade.It does feel a bit like solitaire, however, and do not expect any great social gathering of friends here.

Played once so far. Not bad, and clearly a progenitor for a lot of auction-euros but not really an excuse for the complicated scoring system, the slight player interaction over auctioned items and broad, but unwieldy, strategies. I'm sure it's awesome I'm just not a fan.

This game is excellent, and ticks a lot of boxes on my checklist, particularly that I like building my own little city.  I love little buildings, and I like the scoring mechanism, and I like the gentle pressure the game puts on you, and the race to get ahead of everyone.

But after playing this with 5 players (the so-called optimum number) and seeing practically every card in the game played, it feels like this game is a 'one-and-done'.  I think I saw everything the game has to offer, and that's pretty disappointing.

This game is ugly and every card is too similar. It is probably the most well designed Kramer I've played, but the first play can be frustrating because of the learning curve. Auction is a great self-balancing mechanism, but I always find its use a lazy design (you place ALL the power on the players and players do not make the best judgement). The puzzle aspect is very minor.

Essentially, this game is all about managing limited resources: limited money to bid on auctions and purchase actions, limited actions per turn (2), the limited availability of particular resources (buildings, freedoms, etc.), the limited amount of space available in your palazzo, and even the limited number of turns over which the game is played (7).  There is player interaction via auctions and competing to complete the best "work", and difficult choices abound in every area of the game.  It is intense and there is a learning curve, but the game is terribly satisfying and lots of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not what I was expecting.  Definitely nothing for first timers... there is so much going on, you are likely to lose them.  Many many things going on, but just how much strategy is there?

The auction round really complicates one's ability to do any planning.  Your game outcome is completely dependent on what resources you can win.  Also, there is a lot of luck when pulling cards.

It is a fun game, once you know what you are doing.  Sadly, it didn't scratch that itch for me.

The game play mechanism is interesting but the overall game is kind of boring. All the profession cards give you the same amount of points. So basically it does not matter, which profession name card you are holding in your hand. The only difference with these cards is that they need different things for scoring (lake for this one, park for the other). If you finally score you get the same amount of points for the lawyer (jurist) as you would get for the philosopher profession card.Also the only interaction between the players is in the auction phase. After that there is basically no possibility to interact or influence the other players. So overall I am kind of disappointed with this game. In my opinion this is just a solitary-playing game.

Very tight bidding game - you have to really be on the ball to tune your strategy. Not a lot of direct competition outside the bidding, but still possible to dash opponents' plans if carefully played.

Upgrading my rating from 7 -- First off, the theme, of managing a stable of scholars, is awesome.  I enjoy the Tetris-like manipulation, and the seven auctions, each with two limited actions, give it that wonderful tension common to the heavier Euros, of trying to answer "Which of several awesome things can I do on my shoestring budget, and with my limited time?"

It's a very elegant game, and I see myself playing this classic for years to come.

wow it too me almost 6 years to get it to the table.

Glad I finally did. This is one of the best games, if not the best game, in that genre I've ever played.
I also like the fact that you can only increase your bid by a 100. this adds a wholenew dynamic to the game.

Further I don't think there is a big difference in playing order in a 4 player game. I even think that I would lose too much control in a 5 playergame, but most people think it shines with 5... Would love to play one now..

RATING: 10
This is a very taut, fun experience with five people, and I am probably going to avoid having to play it with fewer.  The bidding round can lead to tight competition for various items, though it may take new players a while to understand the relative values of the auction items, and strategies must adapt to the other players' desires.  It also features pretty game boards that help evoke the theme of Renaissance artists and scholars.

RATING: 5
Oh my god: how is possible, that this game is so close to the TOP-10 list?! This game has only a "medium weight" auction and that's all the interaction between players. The rest is more or less like a solitaire game where your opponents moves doesn't concern you. Because of that, there is like ~1 hour just WAITING for your turn and 30 minutes to actually do something. So serious downtime problems!

So the game has it's big flaws, and the biggest issue for me its the length, but of course I've seen many many worse games too in this genre...

RATING: 7.5
[2008.Feb.19] A tried-and-true game, by Wolfgang Kramer and Richard Ulrich, that includes auctions, resource collection, and tile arrangement. However, managing all of this in only 7 turns, is what separates the serious gamers from the pretenders and this should be played by every serious gamer.

Let out your inner jester, you know you want to... just don't let the other players win that auction.

Although somewhat old, this is a gem.  Limited player interaction which can help less experienced players.  Always fun and "low pressure" despite being very rich.  Extremely elegant mechanics and flow with streamlined and permissive gameplay that achieves remarkable depth given its simplicity and ease of play.  A classic.  (Edit, pushed down a little because of fatigue)

RATING: 4
The first problem with that game is that it is almost a solitaire multiplayer game. There is really few inteaction with other players. Second, it's a game where you need to plan a long time in advance. If fact, you can screw yourself and even get stuck if you plan poorly. The tetris, building placement, part of the game is not that much interesting, they could have put more thought on it making it an interesting part of the game to optimise your constructions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A 'multiplayer solitaire' game of planning and planning and more planning.  Incremental auctions is really the major area of interaction between players.  To me, there seems to be three major pathways to victory.  With four players, I like having only 3 of each of the Freedoms available in the game, one less than # of players (which gives the equivalent tension in a 5p game where there's only 4 freedoms each for 5plyrs).  This is a Wolfgang Kramer classic.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It may almost be multiplayer solitaire, but the interplay of the auction and the action phase is interesting to watch.  Efficiency in building works is key as well as setting yourself up for the future as your works must increase in fame each round.

RATING: 7
Lowering my rating some after several years. Though there is substantial re-playability, the types of situations do seem to repeat themselves. Did you get synergy in your artists? 3 types of synergies, match what you can then try to fulfill the rest, cheaply. Perhaps I played this too much, but it has lost much of its allure for me.

RATING: 2
I traded this away after one play.  Some of the ideas are okay (like the Tetris buildings and the various Professions), but this game really IS multiplayer solitaire.  Seven rather limited auctions are the extent of your interaction with other players in this game.  It seems like you'll win or lose mostly by chance -- the chance of how well your Profession and Prestige cards work together and the chance of how many or few other players want the objects you need.  The rest of the game was just extremely dull downtime.  I can see how certain kinds of people would find this game attractive, but this is the opposite of what I like in a game.

We've found that this game is a great "next step" game after new gamers have played Lords of Waterdeep and the like.  The game incorporates the "puzzle" of assembling landscape and buildings on a grid, while also scoring points for professions you have based on that assembly among other factors.  This is a good medium weight euro game.

Now this is my idea of a fun theme. Plays really well with the right group, although a weak player can ruin this fast (even if not as fast as they can ruin Puerto Rico).

Even though the colours are muted I really love the look of this game - its just seems classy.  It also plays elegantly, with very limited actions but melds together well.

Players numbers are key for this one though - the auction is just not tight enough with three, so I would say at least 4 are required, and would assume this is a real humdinger with 5 (as many have commented).  This puts me of buying it as a fair chunk of my gaming is with 3.

An excellent game of interlocking, competing strategies.  The Tetrisy board layout doesn’t appeal to me, but having multiple players ride at the edge of getting enough points for a work or for the bonus can make things pretty tense.

I love this game, and can't get enough of it.  While I understand the complaints of 'multi-player solitaire' I don't think that they are accurate, and the fact that a single bad or great auction can dramatically change the course of your strategy should keep you engaged anyway.

I also like that this is a serious multi-player strategy game that doesn't suffer from 'screw the leader,' 'runaway leader,' or 'kingmaker' in any serious form.  Occasionally a dumb move in the auction can cause one of the latter two, but it is rare, and not absolute.

The only possible downside, IMO, is the downtime, which can be made worse by the odd case of analysis paralysis.  The ability to consider your own strategy in this downtime is just as high, though, so it shouldn't be too great a problem for anyone who 'gets' the game.

UPDATE: Well, I finally decided to give this a 10.  The only thing that had been holding me back before was the apparent weakness of the 3-player game, but I've now played many many three-player games with experienced players, and I've seen that it can be at least as tense and interesting as an average 4-player game.  10 it is.

Very glad I've played this before having it ruined for me (us) by reading the "must play main line - do this or be an idiot" problem that [GameID=3076] has. Reading any PR strategy sucks. Thank God this game was not ruined the way Puerto Rico has been ruined.

This is one of my favorites.  I find it's rather complicated to explain to people, and as one friend noted, it has a boring-sounding title.  But, hey, it's lots of fun.

Takes awhile to get through all the rounds, but it's well worth it.

Classic auction strategy game. I played it in 2008 so it felt a bit underwhelming. It seems "deja-vu". But when you realize that this is one of the game that really started the hobby you have to respect it :)

Planning is key here. There are so few turns in the game that you almost need to know your whole game plan before the first turn. 

I think this game it is a bit dry though. And I am sick of landlord/master/king theme where gaining prestige is the way to win!

You are prince of Florence and you are trying to get artists to create great works of art.  You gather entertainment and diversion for artists and build buildings for them to work.

Like [i]Puerto Rico[/i], this game rarely gets to the table due to the "cult of the new" and, like [i]Puerto Rico[/i], I rather enjoy it.

NEW EDITION?

Super highly rated game BUT can have a bit of downtime. Requires ability to think ahead (very limited resources and choices, but an abundance of opportunities and choices). 2 player variant plays much quicker than the typical 3-5 player version. Not difficult to learn but definitely NOT an entry level game or a game for newcomers (as it will require a few plays (3-5) before becoming an enjoyable jaunt. Typically sells for $25 online.

NonGamers DO seem to enjoy this. Yet, others have said:
"As always, there are things not to love about the game. Its not a game I'd choose to teach to non-gamers, even though I know that they will love the game after a few plays. Why is this? It probably comes down to how often you can game with a particular non-gaming-group of people. If this is the one shot to get them into gaming, PoF is a big risk. If you're bound to game again in the future, PoF will almost certainly be a succes. Multiple games is key here, I think."
AND
"Non-gamers HATE this game. Period. Playing Princes of Florence with true non-gamers (e.g. folks who played Monopoly yonks ago and vaguely remember trying to learn Risk that one time in college) is akin to trying to entertain your four-year old nephew with the Director's Cut of "Remains of the Day"."
AND (in reply to the previous quote): 
This has not been my experience at all. The rules are simple and the theme/goal of making cool stuff is rather intriguing to people who don't game. New gamers probably won't grasp the strategy or understand how to thread all their actions together throughout the game, but bidding and building is fun in and of itself and very accessible.

REPRINT expect 12/2010 ($30)

Notwithstanding a wonderful ranking, it appears as though there should not be a big rush to get this game. Especially in light of the more FUN games that are likely to get played a lot more.

CONCLUSION: A very big WANT in terms of personally playing it. A very unenthusiastic LIKE in terms of trying it with my students (especially considering all the other games laying dormant).

RPG Rates this as a 1-2 hours playtime and min of 3 players. Until I have a few plays and can determine suitability for the games library, keep it on the Wishlist as a "3"

Impressions after first 4-player game are very good. Yes, blind-bidding for impossible-to-value-items is difficult but something I expect one gets a feeling for with experience. The usual "so much to do but too litle time" applies.  Most important seems to stay ahead of the game each of the seven rounds - don't "paint yourself into a corner".

Rich and complex game where strategy is important while reacting tactically to other players is important. Fixed # of rounds makes for a quick game which requires careful planning to do well.

RATING: 8
This game is easy to learn, but hard to play - in my first game, I painted myself into a corner and could do nothing on my final turn - but that just makes me want to do better next time. This feels like a more complex version of Colosseum (not surprisingly, they share a designer), with some Blokus-style tile placement thrown in. However, the greater focus on auctions and trading in Colosseum makes it a better, more interactive game.

This is basically a bidding game, with a little resource optimisation on top. However I have come to dislike the lack of interaction (except for the bidding) and the paste-on theme. Still an ok design, will play occasionally.

[Played 65 times]

Masterwork of "agonizing decisions". Light player interaction (olny trought auctions, but they're a crucial element of the game). Negligible luck. Beautiful artwork. It needs 5 players (otherwise the auctions aren't tense and the game is ruined).

very good strategical play possible 
1)with the prestige cards
2) which rounds will you make a work - which rounds will you use to get the most advantagous cards ? careful planning is needed.
original system : you choose if you convert your work points into victory points or money
good bidding system gives enough interaction - sometimes painful decision
very little luck
unforgiving game ; don't run out on money - but this can easily be prevented. Try to have on the end of the round at least 800 florins (exception :going to the last round) 
contrary as many say ; there is sufficient interaction in the bidding ; bluff plays also a considerable role
-
 downtime can be a problem with AP gamers ; but you always can optimalise your own plan
 after many plays there's a certain danger of scripted play. But you can enhance the variability using the expansion, which makes the game more forgiving.

Our first time playing the game was tonight. My 15-year old son, who hates luck based games, immediately proceeded to figure out how to cover the entire palazzo with the game pieces. He took a digital photo of the layout, and then proceeded to play the game with the goal of achieving that end.  Believe it or not, he did!  He came in second with 54 points, right behind his 18-year old brother, who had 55 points!  Dad came in third with 46.  Everyone really enjoyed the game.

I disliked the game after the first play, but enjoyed the second at least a little.  I read up on strategies on the Geek, and I played it a few more times.  However, I just cannot seem to get into it.  I find myself being petulant and just trying to ruin the game for a random player (or Boaz if he's playing).

I don't know why I bought this game or why I bought Puerto Rico.  I'm guessing I was seduced by their high ratings on the Geek, and they were two of the first I bought since coming to this site.  I've learned, since then, that GeekBuddies, Session Reports and Reviews are the best ways to scout out game purchases.

UPDATE:  I've played a few more times, and twice at WBC (including a semi-final, in which I placed second to Eric, last year's champ).  I'm still not sure I'm having fun while playing this, but I will play it now if it is offered in a group.

Played three times and enjoyed it more each time.  The real challenge in the auction phase comes in determining whether you can jack up someone else's expense by bidding but not get stuck winning something you didn't want, and whether to start the bidding with something you don't want just to get another player to take it and be out of the running for the rest of the auction.  I like that drawing a card actually means drawing five and choosing the best--you might not get a game-winning mega card, but you'll almost always get something you can use.

RATING: 4
Auctions, scarce turns which demands on a careful plan, limitation on resources, puzzle-like element, beautiful artwrks, interesting theme combined in a 1.5-hour game... Good, but not for me.

Firstly, it is too analyzable. You can count remaining actions, remaining auctions, remaining cards, also points you can get. You can decide all that which you'll buy and which you'll do after one or two rounds, sometimes before the game begins. (Well, you don't have to decide in advance, if you don't mind a loss)

This almost perfect analyzability deprives this game of much fun. Keeping track of all that which I should do and which I can do is exhausting. Fail on getting required resource is frustrating. Waiting for my turn watching other player actions which is not significant for me after deciding what I'll do is boring.

Secondly(this is related to first reason), it is very solitary. All the players' heart is filled with their own boards, their own current status and their future actions. Each players' actions rarely arouse interest of other players. Even the auctions becomes procedural with experienced players.

First and second reason combined: there rarely are astonishing actions, fulfilling moments, funny situations, only methodological selection.

This would be a good game for a planner, analyzer, optimizer... which I am not.

The game sounds good but it wasn't as exciting as it sounded from the description. The fact is that the theme and description is more exciting than the actual game in my opinion. It's still a good game, just not as exciting as I hoped it would be. It's an auction game at its core. There's decisions and planning but it just felt dry to me.

Played 5-10 times. Difficult to explain but not that hard to learn. I don´t mind the indirect player interaction. Sometimes it´s nice not to have event cards thrown at you while you´re trying to accomplish something :-)

The game can be difficult if you haven´t played for a long time. The limited number of actions and the limited interaction need a reasonable playing time to keep it interesting.

Nice-looking fun game that I never win. Lots of decision making and no clear path to victory. My one complaint is I think this an example of a game with 'pasted on' mechanics (yes I know people usually use this term to refer to theme, but I think it often works the other way 'round). The auction phase in particular bugs me - there is simply no way to argue that only one renaissance prince could plant a forest at a time, etc. The auction makes for a great game, but doesn't make any 'real' sense.

Princes of Florence is one of the drier Euro's.  I suppose in the end that was the biggest reason I didn't like the game as much, but there were others.  The potential imbalance in player ability is not as severe as Puerto Rico, but knowing how much the auctioned items are worth is a large part of the game.  Another small distaste was the way the progressive scores are affected by lucky draws to the profession deck.  In a game of optimization, you could easily draw or not (yes, even when picking up multiple cards) a profession that is a near perfect fit while your opponents do the opposite.

To me, this game is more about passive conflict in that you are attempting to make your opponents overpay for their profession tools almost as much as you are attempting to complete your own works.  I am beginning to see that I do not generally like those types of games.

A good game, would play again but doubt it will become a favourite.  Difficult to stop opponents unless you have a clear idea of the value of each decision to be made at auction time and can force the auction price up accordingly, as this is the main interaction point.  This would be solved with future plays, but much like Puerto rico, this game isn't suitable for play where there is a vast difference in experience.  The game can also be a bit maths-y as there are constant calculations involved.

I'd heard such good things from multiple sources I actually went and bought this one unplayed from Shire Games, not something I usually do.

Thankfully, I got my first play an hour later at The Cast are Dice with 5 people (Nick, Matthew, Tulsa, Seraquel, and myself).  There wasn't too much to learn, but there was quite a lot when it came to the strategy side (which Matthew had nailed and raced ahead of the rest of us).  I peaked early with a master work and didn't quite manage to keep it up until the end.

If you're looking for a quality strategy game with bits then look no further.

Lost to a lot of jesters. This game has an (open) auction and that's really not my thing. I like the building grid and planning your moves.

[b]2015-09-22 7[/b] After 1x 4p:
Feel like I should enjoy it more than I did. I am typically fine with dry theme and love building or tile laying games. Somehow even this 7 is a bit forced. Perhaps it was the feeling of set collection? The moving auctioneer does demand strategic play but the auction itself isn't that tense. This [i]should[/i] be a good puzzle game though and I will need to play it once more to find out why it missed the mark for me.

I really liked this game. Great bidding/building game. The tetris buildings add some strategy into how you plan your palazzo and the bonus/extra cards can really help add up the points. A resource/worker placement game with enough twists to make it a worthwhile addition to a collection. Overall it isn't a terribly difficult game, but enough of a challenge to keep it from being a gateway game. It helps to keep track of what your opponents are doing, but the card's script/small text makes it a pain to develop a plan without jumping up every 5 minutes to see what everyone has played.

The lack of screwage makes me sad.  It seemed to me like I couldn't mess with anyone else without hurting my own position (buying or bidding up a suboptimal piece).  Result--dull.  Straight auctions are not a mechanic I enjoy.

Maybe I'm missing something there and the opportunity for screwage would be apparent with more plays.  As it is, I'll probably pass.  I would only play this if others really really wanted to.

Got a ton of play when it first came out but the people I know that really loved this game pretty much "solved" it and that threw the games we played out of wack until those of us who were still learning couldn't compete.  Love to find/make some new opponents that would appreciate this game.

12/23/03 Played a four-player game. 08/21/05 Played a three-player game. Its OK, I'd play it again. But the game just doesn't grab me for some reason. I can't really put my finger on why. 
Minor rant: I don't like the italics on the cards. Its hard enough to read right side up in front of you. Its impossible up side down across the table. A very poor design choice.
01/17/12 Played a five player-game. Seven years later my main reaction to the game is still "eh". Plus, why does almost everything have to be some shade of tan/brown? Talk about drab!

Les Princes de Florence est la version française tant attendu (qui a parlé d'Arlesienne ? L'action se déroule à Florence !) du jeu de Richard Ulrich et Wolfgang Kramer, Dïe Fursten von Florenz, initialement sorti en 2000 chez l'éditeur allemand Alea.

La version 2006 du jeu est identique à celle de 2000 à quelques détails près : nouveau matériel, nouvelles illustrations, la variante à deux joueurs est intégré dans les règles, ainsi qu'une variante qui répond au doux nom de "Muse et Princesse".

Princes has been one of my favorite games for a long time.  I love the auctioning aspect to the game, along with the many minor competitions throughout (fighting over the freedoms, getting the right bonus card to edge out your opponents for the largest work, etc.), but that you still maintain and improve your own city in the best way that you can.  I really love playing this game, although the dominance of the Jester strategy has taken away some fun in recent games.  However, I always feel that I've done quite well even if I end up being dead last, which greatly improves my overall enjoyment of the game.  Definitely a heavier game with long-term planning, but certainly one that I will not turn down the chance to play.

Very fun game!  This game took an hour to explain to non-gamers and played for 2 hours with 4 people.  The auctions are very fun and really start to heat up as people learn what is good and how much things are "worth". Very enjoyable, the only game that beats this so far for me is El Grande.  It's easier to teach and has a little more action. We love this game 3/4 players said they wanted to play again.

After one play, I was surprised how smoothly it went.  I hadn't prepared properly before, and the game still took not much longer than the printed time (which is unusual for my game group).

After repeated plays, this game still shines as one of my all-time favorites (with 4-5 players).  I strongly suggest using the BGG player aids to assist in helping new players.  Once you have a handle on the game, it flows smoothly and briskly.  Many paths to victory.  Fun decisions.  Not a huge amount of constant player interaction, but a really nice blend of solo contemplation and inter-personal exchange.  Put on some classical music in the background and be transported.

Simple, concise. There's nothing sloppy about this game. This game is all about difficult decisions.

My rating is bumped up to a 9 after a very good 3-player. With 4 I believe it would've been better.

Update: still a very good game that can be played in under an hour. Too bad nobody I know likes to play this game. : (

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Auction and buy the pieces needed to create great works. The better the work, the more points gained towards victory or more money made to put into future works... your choice.

Played as: 3 and 5 player

Pros: Finally, after four plays of this game, I just played using the right rules and I feel sooo much better about it. Very balanced (too balanced?) gameplay makes game close and interesting beginning to end.

Cons: Even though I've only played this once- the right way, with players still working to grasp the new (correct) flow of the game, I feel in the long run this will be a game of splitting hairs. It's like something as simple as overbidding 100 florin in one auction could make all the difference rather then implementing sound decisions the entire game in the action phase.

Other: Negative assumptions about this game being decided solely in the auction phase aside, I still think the action phase is what makes this game as fun as it is. Simply put, you may win the game in the auctions, but play and enjoy because of the actions.

Best Use: Playing with your regular group of gamers on game night.

The rules seem a lot longer than they really are. Everything is intuitive. And as the trend in games go, you have lots of options, and you can only do two of them and you want to do them all. The blending of many different types of game mechanisms is elegant.
For teaching it I suggest a walk through of a turn after a brief theme and goal explanation. I wish there was a little more player interaction. Sold it off, game is just too non-interactive for my tastes. (2006) With the strength of recent games this isn't going to get played by me. Just seems like multiplayer solitaire. (2012)

A little bit of tetris mixed with auctioning mechanics. So much to do, so little time to do it. The theme sucks, but the game is solid. Probably the best relatively complex game I have. I put it in the same boat as Year of the Dragon, Cuba, and Puerto Rico and would choose this game over them all.

RATING: 10
One of the all time classics.  When it comes down to it, the constraints of this game (you win 7 auctions and take 14 actions.  Period.) make it remarkably analyzable, without usually falling to bad analysis-paralysis, largely because there remain multiple effective paths to winning.

Definitely better than PR. There is a lot of strategy in there, but the game definitely needs some investment to figure out what's going on and how to go about doing things. The problem is, I'm not sure that I (and my group) are willing to invest that kind of time in a single game. I'd be willing to try, but it will probably be crowded out by other games more frequently than not.

The ultimate strategic-planning game.  I've observed that this is perfect for 5 (makes the auction phase much more tense which is where most of the interaction is).  I also found that it's one of those games where my biggest challenge is my own puny brain.  I feel like my biggest competition is myself (probably why many people mention there's a bit of solitaire in the game).  The trick is to choose a strategy early (right after choosing your People "goal" cards) and then try to stick with it as long as the auctions permit you to.

RATING: 8
PoF is a rare treat... it seems to have different metagames for beginners and veteran players.  When all players are new or only have a few games under their belt, the tactical turn-by-turn nature of auction-action-work is loads of fun.  Looking into the strategic possibilities, however, it seems that for those with tons of play there can be some hardcore competition for those victory points.  Nice range of playability - okay with 3, great with 4, possibly great with 5.

I am always looking forward to my next game of Princes. It forces you to think in a very interesting way; that is, it is much harder to go into with a preset strategy than something like Puerto Rico. You have to adjust to what opportunities are given to you, in a much more pronounced way than any other game I have played. And that thought process is creeping into my consciousness in other contexts as well.

Met all my expectations the first time I played it, and has steadily climbed since then. Lately I'm wondering if an overarching strategy is "go nuts in something".

Wow! That is what I think of this game! Sure, luck is a factor, but this is offset by the mechanics of the game. Reading your opponents correctly is of mayor importance, while calculating what and when to buy or produce a work is crucial to become the winner. The game is well balanced and the player interaction, although limited to the auctions, is fine! Have dropped from a 10 (!) but is unlikely to drop any further.

After a couple plays, I think I've figured this game out well enough to know it's not for me. At least I was able to win one against a group of serious gamers (though not to my knowledge PoF aces).

It strikes me that it is a "calculating" auction game. You can calculate approximately what something will be worth to you for the whole game, and bid approximately that.

For an auction game, I prefer Ra, which to me is more of an intuitive auction game. You can't bid exactly what something is worth to you. For one you don't know, because there is significant randomness in what will come up later that will affect the value. Also, you can't bid what something is worth, because your bid is not in the same currency as the value. Suns have no direct relationship to points, unlike in Princes of Florence where money has a fixed conversion ratio to VPs, although you can only apply the conversion at a specific time and in limited amounts.

Enjoyed the auction dynamics as well as the lack of direct competition.  It was fun to try to plan future developments, though the indirect competition for resources and auction goods was challenging (in a good way) to incorporate into a plan.  The game requires significant amounts of planning in the first few moves to be successful.  I definitely want to play many more times, but need to think about it beforehand.

The game has a huge element of experience in it; I typically play with folks who LOVE the game, and who have their strategies already planned out on the first move (and who know the actual value of every auctionable-item).  This makes the game difficult to play for me, as I don't know this (and thus make copious mistakes).

My only complaint is that the colors are very bland - trying for that renaissance look of parchment and faded ink.  Nit picky I know, but otherwise, very very good.

Current record holder for "owned it the longest without playing it." It's a 3-5 player game, and we don't have company often enough for me to pull out a new, unplayed game yet. I'd rather play any of a dozen things I'm already familiar with but never get to play w/more than 2.

Sorry, PoF.

Finally played, 2 player game vs my wife. Interesting, Jesters seem very powerful.

Really need to play more, and with more than 2 players.

I dunno. I played it a bit on BSW when I first got it to learn the mechanics, and played a couple of games of it with my gaming group who were highly underwhelmed. It has since not seen the light of day in nine months. I'm not particularly attached to it, so it might as well be added to the trade pile.

Took a look at my plays and realized it's been almost a year since this hit the table. Too many better and more interesting games. Traded away 4/28/09.

Solid game that felt a lot like Agricola but with auctions instead of worker placement. Both present players with many options, considerable constraints, and a nifty little tableau you're trying to build out for maximum points. I do find worker placement a more elegant mechanism for handling action/resource selection, but I can see the potential here for more varied strategies. I also like the relatively swift playing time, but that's mitigated by the need for five (or maybe four) players.

Dropped my rating from a 10 down to an 8 after I realized that this is one of those games where a newbie is at a great disadvantage. Since I don't have a regular gaming group, I'm always teaching new games to my friends. A game between 3 newbies and 2 experienced players will not be much of a game. Still, it's quite excellent.

Boring theme.

Was fun to play.  I don't have a preference for auction games, but it didn't hurt the gameplay at all.  It felt nice to build up your little estate.  You're always crunched for time and resources.  There's a bit of competition for resources which I enjoyed.  Not a bad game.

A good auction game that stands the test of time. The auctions are meaningful and tense.  The choices of how to build your principality are deep and multifaceted. Each game led to a lot of discussions about the tactical and strategic choices we made.  This is a game that can stick with you.

I found the art and graphic design to be dry and dated.  I think that in this day of beautifully painted boards and high detail minis, it's hard for a game like this to attract players.  Nevertheless, I've really enjoyed every play!

Princes relies on the players to balance the auctions.  Novices might not realize how incredibly powerful the jokers are.  As long as they are purchased for the right price, the game is balanced.  But if new players don't know to drive up that price, it can seem unbalanced.

Another auction game not favored by my group.  I liked it okay, my group did not.

This is a great game for serious gamers who are trying to get their not-so-serious gaming friends to try something with a little more meat. This game seems to have a little bit of everything I enjoy in a game: auctions, limited number of actions, resource management, and even tile placement for Tetris fans. Other positives include a strong theme, plenty of strategic options, and high replay value.

Way too much downtime between player turns. The auctions, which are the only real player interaction in the game, are too short and mechanical. Overall its a game with a lot of silence. A good example of the "elegant" Eurogames format taken too far with the end result being as soulless number crunching exercise. This game is my litmus test for player compatability - if someone tells me they really like playing this game a lot then I'm unlikely to enjoy playing anything with them. My advice is if you want a "multiplayer solitaire" eurogame then stick with Puerto Rico because it has a LOT less downtime and MUCH more player interaction than PoF.

A well put together game that combines an engine building mechanic with a Tetris style placement. Despite the repetitive nature of the turns the tension mounts each round with the need to make each placement more valuable each round.

Another game played for the first time at the UK BayCon 2006 and another instant hit with me.  

Went on my wish list after just two plays with the feeling that there was plenty more to discover in this one.

Update, July 2006: Several more plays under my belt and I was right about there being more to discover:  My play has moved up a notch as I've been playing with some very good players, and yet I still feel as though I can get more out of this.  All you could wish for in a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good Euro game that for some is a little dry. There is little room for luck here as planning and execution are rewarded and for this reason it can be a game that favours the more experienced.

The theme here is that each player is a Prince and they are trying to display their greatness by supporting the most thriving province of skilled artisans and intellects. Providing for these persons will hopefully pay off in great works that you can then sell for a profit and thus enhance your reputation.

Definitely a game that relies on your personal taste so I recommend trying it if you haven't played it before.

An old classic. It's not a difficult game, in fact quite easy as you know what you want and the key lies in the execution of getting the things you need.

RATING: 10
Even after repeated play, this game causes me to reevaluate my current position.  It benefits from the random elements of card draws to increase replayability without allowing a player to win by chance.

If all players are fast enough, then the game is more of the auction game than multi-player solitaire. With players who don't start thinking his/her move until his/her turn, the game is too much solitaire with a lot of down time. Rules are bit confusing. Too many different special cards, which is not my taste. I wish it is bit more sofisticated over all.

One of my absolute favourites. A variety of ways to play/win - some, if not all, dependent on what others win in the auctions, and others' actions. There are only 7 auction phases and only 14 actions each, and every one counts. Don't undervalue jesters!

RATING: 9.7
A hodgepodge of Euro mechanics combine into one of the most interesting game designs in all of gaming. The game greatly rewards strategy, even though you only get about 14 actions over the course of a game. Despite a relatively simple ruleset, there are myriad paths to victory. The auctions are derided by some, but they enable the game to remain highly variable from play to play. A classic.

An extreme example of a eurogame.  This game feels mostly like solitare to me.  Though there are other players and you do compete against them (obviously), the player interaction is extremely low.  The board and bits are very good, again typical of a eurogame.  My rating on this is somewhat...unstable...at this moment.  I would really like to try the game again down the line a bit to see if I really like it or not.

All board gamers are the descendants of Renaissance folk. You cannot be a board gamer without honoring your roots.  Prince of Florence allows you to capture that feel. You become the Patron of many professionals, artists, and scholars.  You attempt for the right fit to build the better works of art. You steal professionals from your rivals.  And finally, through competition the works are elevated with each new turn. In 2000, before Puerto Rico and Caylus, this was the game.  Dated, but like the Renaissance itself, timeless and seminal.

I'm not exactly sure what it was with this game, but it didn't really punch me as an overly "fun" game.  My friends and I played it back to back to ensure we got a good feel for the game, but I didn't feel too excited while playing it.  Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a good game, but yeah... like I said.. I can't really put my finger on what doesn't make it "great".

Rating 9, and going up.  Delicious tension in deciding how tight you want to play the game.

A solid 9 for sure.  Multiple strategies, but how to execute them!  That's the key to good PoF play.  Unlike most euros you NEED a long term plan in this one or you're sunk.

A wonderful game.  Lot's of mechanics to learn before one can really "get" what's going on.  Be sure to play with at least four players, as doing so introduces scarcity of resources, meaning more to consider in your overall strategy.

Great game that at its core is an auction game.  After the auction phase everyone gets their turn to perform actions that get you buildings, freedoms, and a few other things that make your profession cards worth more when you play them.  The fact that there are MANY different paths to victory makes this game re-playable and enjoyable.  

Although I have only played once I can already say that this is a deep game that will have to be played a few times before you deeply understand the strategies and pathways to victory.  Tough for new players to compete because the game is based around bidding and auctions that new players will not know what to go for.

Definitely has some interesting aspects and feels deep. I think it'll take a few more plays to develop a strategy. The key to winning seems to be to knowing how to price the goods correctly and then purchasing the best bargains. But like Genoa, I wonder if developments in the genre in the past 13 years have rendered the gameplay in this one quaint. I think it stands up better than Genoa because it's so laser-focused on a single mechanic -- auction pricing.

NOTE: When I say that the RGG-printed rules are a bit arcane, I mean that I have had this game for three years and have played it at least 10 times before playing a game where I didn't misinterpret a rule.  Be warned.

This game is not for everyone: at least one member of my group hates this game because of its unforgiving nature.  I like it enough to not turn down a 4+ player game.

Surprisingly, I don't hate the "too much, not enough" mechanic here.  The scarcity somehow fits.

"Die Fürsten von Florenz" é um dos mais legais que vi recentemente, porque junta temática e mecânicas muito legais. A ideia é cada jogador ser um príncipe de Florença focado no mecenato. Quem bancar os artistas e cientistas mais famosos fica mais famoso entre os pares, e portanto ganha o jogo. Para isso, você disputa com os demais pelos elementos que inspiram os artistas: paisagens, prédios e liberdades. Daí tome leilão e gastos. É um jogo profundamente estratégico, sem que isso o torne longo: uma partida com 5 pessoas levou pouco mais de uma hora. Recomendo pra jogadores de nível intermediário.

RATING: 10
Take the jesters if you can. (See the less viable builder strategy at Fawkes)
The only player interaction in the game are the auctions, which will decide the eventual winner, so you have to pay attention there. Because of the importance of the auction and in spite of what its critics say, this game is no solitaire.  Plays within an hour and a half, and it is great with 4 and fantastic with 5.
Highest rated game on BGG from the year 2000.
The Princess and the Muse expansion changes the values of the auctioned items and hence the strategies . It offers a more varied game in a longer time frame. The base game is tighter, less forgiving of mistakes. The expansion is still a 10 though.
In the Cooperative builders expansion you are dependent upon your neighbors' cooperation in getting VPs or money, and have limited control over that. You have zero control over the negotiations of non neighbors. I was not impressed by my only play so far, and may not be enthusiastic to give it another try.

(I own the new edition)

An excellent game where there are so few actions and you would like to do so much... Although the game flow is always pretty much the same there is enough tension in trying to find cheapest moments to do those absolutely necessary moves and trying to find edge over other player's. Always a pleasure to play.

Ungh. As boring as it looks, and there's too much downtime. And the font makes my eyes hurt.

A strange breed of game. I quite like the auction and the tile laying aspect and the general feel of the game. Creating a work reminds me of character driven ccgs - such as Babylon 5 or Vampire. You have your character; John Sheridan, Astrid the Vampire or in the case POF a Poet or Cartographer. Then tool them up with a PPG Rifle, a chainsaw or a nice forest and library. Whack a couple of events or bonuses on them and send them to support a diplomacy conflict, inflict a bleed or create a lovely piece of art. The only difference is that in the ccgs the opponents can oppose or disrupt you plans whereas in POF you create the art and just score the points.

The choice between victory points or more money is nice, but the final outcome is really flat, especially as you plan the whole game for a couple of big payouts at the end. (6.5)

Probabilmente il miglior gioco di aste in circolazione. Il poco margine di scelta sulle innumerevoli opportunità fornite ad ogni turno (solo sette) impongono aste agguerrite specie ad inizio gioco. La nuova versione di Principi di Firenze prevede un'ulteriore asta (fase A2) intermedia per aggiudicarsi anche un favore. L'esperienza è importante in questo gioco perché ogni asta risulterà determinante soprattutto se equiparata al turno in cui viene fatta. Favori reali, costruttori e joker andranno a ruba ma ricordatevi che si vince con i punti vittoria e quindi anche le carte Prestigio sono da tenere in considerazione. Un gioco molto bello da giocare assolutamente in almeno 4 o 5, da non proporre in 3 quando le aste diventano poco avvincenti. Trovo la confezione e i materiali della versione italiana molto eleganti, ma il carattere non del tutto leggibile. Un gioco consigliatissimo!

RATING: 10
A glorious and very stylish gaming experience. The combination of auction and tile-placement feel made for each other, and the thematics are poetic, to say the least. Art and general design are beautiful if almost entirely inaccessible, but the subtle up-and-down dynamic to the interaction and construction elements is perfectly pitched. Potentially agonising downtime is an irritant, and the game is surely best when you've had the opportunity to learn the decks of cards well.

Further Thoughts: A couple of outstandingly good plays have pushed this one up to a 9.5. There really is very little to match it, one would think.

learned this game at midnight played till 2am... loved the game... didn't love being so exhausted... play this game.... dont start at midnight

the game is a tad tricky to pick up... but one you got it, you got it

4 person game was really fun... and i think it would also play well with 5... our gaming group considers this a staple game... so i'm glad to have learned it... it is very fun with a lot of possibilites... and the auctioning makes this game extra awesome!!

I'm excited to play again


Recommend... to gamers... or those with  at least 4 that are willing to learn a fun game


[2010/01/27]

Slick game, and i mean totally slick...

Our gaming group pulled this out as a "staple game"... and the first playwas like most learning games, but i instantly realized that i wanted to  play it again... so low and behold, My wife and I got a second go at this game, with our gaming group... I got a semi lucky draw to start off with, and i played  with a good strategy... this game held my interest, and it was very competitive... at the end of the game My wife won with a super score (beating me by 1!)... and it just so happened, that my final move to give myself an extra 3 points, took 8 points (and the victory) away from another player... SUPER CLOSE GAME...

To reiterate, this was our second play... we picked it up easily, and it has proven to be totally fun.... also it is an intuitve game, thats why my wife and i could just pick it up and be competitive with veteran Florence players 

This game is further proving to me that Auctions can make games awesome... the auctions here change the ideal way to play each game. In addition to good strategy, you need to know how to evaluate value at every turn.

I recomend this HIGHLY to anyone that likes strategy game with multiple ways to win.

I bet that learning this game by yourself would be rather hard... but it's worth it

I've only played the game once (4 player), but it felt fairly mechanical to me.  I didn't find the choices I had to be all that interesting, but it is possible that I was just really missing out on the strategy.

RATING: N/A
The first time I played this game I was really disappointed with it. The reason was we were playing it with 2-players and we had to play with 2 boards each. But, now that we have the 2-player rules from the Alea Treasure Box expansion, we can enjoy the game again...for the first time.

Now, with the 2-player rules, this is a great medium weight game that can be played in a fairly short amount of time. It's meaty and clever and fun. The betting in the auction is still a little off...even with the 2-player rules. But, the game play is not affected too much. I can see where this game probably shines best with more players. 

The artwork and font used in this game is annoying! The neutral light tan and brown color of everything in the game does not make this game appealing to anyone in our game groups. Therefore, this game only comes out for my wife and I. I fear never really getting to play this game with more players because of it's overall drab appearance and game theme appeal. I really wish this game would be picked up by a publisher and the artwork updated.

The Alea Treasure Box expansion adds 2-player rules for this game and it has an additional expansion of 6 new characters to choose from in a second auction. You bid in the normal auction first, followed by a second auction on the characters (even with 2-players, this second auction works very well). The new characters provide some powerful new options for everyone to choose from. They are maybe too powerful for a 2-player game...but I can see it adding some nice options for playing with up to 5 players.

Tetris with cardboard pieces in Renaissance Italy. Everyone was raving about this game: "classic, elegant, blah blah blah." And maybe this is not the game's fault but I was underwhelmed when I played this game. And, by all accounts, I should love this game because it has everything I love about a good, solid Euro: historical, simple in strategy but has depth, beautiful components, a nasty auction, finicky little pieces that you can step on and hurt yourself...everything! But Princes of Florence somehow left me wanting more. It didn't feel thematic nor atmospheric. It just felt sort of...dull. Don't get me wrong: this game is harmless. It's not a game I hate or refuse to play. It's just...meh. Bland. Beige. But I'm ready to change my opinion. Prove me wrong!

Very puerto ricoish in weight.  I really liked both plays (3,5) but think the game is really awesome with 5 people.  It makes the auction phase much more difficult and drives the price of items up.  The game feels so quick since there are only 14 actions to get everything done.  It seems pretty important to get extra professions, either by the stack or winning recruiting auctions.

50+ games. One of the best auction games out there. It really shines when played amongst experienced players, where the valuations are broadly known and therefore tightly contested - how far over general value consensus can you afford to go without throwing away the game; given what other people have done so far, what's likely to go for dear and cheap next round. There's exactly the right balance between actions and auctions to keep the game flowing rather than being repetitive.

This is a very difficult game to review, since the game play has so many intricacies. What must be noted is that it is a game where you have to make sure to use your moves wisely and spend money prudently. It always seems like you need one more action to really get a lot of points. The game is very nicely designed and plays well at 3, 4 or 5.  I have played with many different people and most can grasp it within two plays. I have found however, that the more I play, the less I like it. After a while it becomes tiresome. Yet still worth a try by any serious gamer.

One of the few games I kept from my original board game purge back in 2000, and I'm very glad I did.  Although it doesn't hit the table nearly often enough, The Princes of Florence is still my favorite Eurogame of all time.  Yes, the first game is brutal for players who don't understand the value of jesters (and the second is brutal because they dramatically overpay for them), but the game's engine is tight, you always want to do lots of things, and it's always interesting and fun.

What a lovely auction this game has. After my first play I spent the next day thinking about how intricate the game was.  

The second and third games games I won buy buying as many jesters as possible. I ended up with either three or four. All games so far have been 4-player. I want to try with five.

This game gets better each year.  Its such a classic euro.

RATING: 7
This game features some very tight auctions and some very limited actions (only 14 in the entire game), making long-term planning very important.  I like the fact that you can only bid one more in the auction phase, it cuts down on overanalysis.  I like how you spend the game balancing getting what you need now and paying a heavy price, versus what you will probably need eventually and paying a lower price.  The game seems to advantage certain player seats (2nd in 5-player, 3rd in 4-player) because of the odd number of works--no idea why the designer did this.

RATING: 6
Played it only a few times in the early 2000's. Hard to get it out to the table with Power Grid and Puerto Rico being so popular. Great components, cool theme, good stuff. 8/7 Losing interest in this title, perhaps will take another look if/when the art is redone. Rating dropped to 7 (from 9). 4/13: dropping to 6. Art is uninspiring. Been playing Puerto Rico deluxe edition every time over this game.

Oct 14: bought a friends copy, which I had actually given him a number of years ago as a gift (he probably forgot). I may make a special effort to play this with him at least once, but it's tough, because I'd really rather play Puerto Rico over this, and that's what always happens when I think about it. Copy is shrink-wrapped, making it extra hard to pull the trigger.

Sold for $25 or so, May 2015.

More fun with the character cards. They add more dynamics. You can take these cards to block another player. The basic game lets you do the same things every round. I expected more about such a highly rated game.

Works well for two players but the bidding part isn't that important. The first player makes a bid and the second one mostly passes. I can imagine that the bidding engine works better with 3+ players. I really would love to try it with 3+ players.

There's another expansion in the box, next to the character cards, waiting to get tried out.

TRY Aug/05 (BSW, as die Fursten von Florenz):...still learning... tentative rating.  I find this one tough to rate accurately.

While the game is interesting, and has lots going on, some of the later auctions become fairly game-breaking, as some people won't get much/anything useful.  After 3 plays, I understand WHAT is going on, but I'm still not sure just how much FUN it is.  It's got me thinking about strategy, though.

And basic game concept, which, as one of the Princes of Florence, is essentially to 'hire' some artists, make them as comfortable as possible based on their preferences (and common ones, like jesters & other artists), and then choose when to make them display the 'art' that they've produced for you (and then release them from your service).

I find most auction games to be tough on beginners (while they learn the relative values); this is no exception.

As well, the concept of an artist's 'work value' is abstract, as it is just a temporary result then converted into Florins ($) and/or Prestige Points (PP, or victory points).  You need a cheat-sheet handy for calculating these WVs, just to figure out how to affect it with all the available influences (buildings in 3 sizes, builders, landscapes, recruiters, jesters, bonus cards, prestige cards, freedoms), and the increasing round WV minimums.  Whew!  That's a LOT to keep straight!

All of this affects its approachability, to me.

An all time classic! Tight, balanced, full of tough decisions and a pleasure to play. Really shines with the full compliment of 5 players, but it's also a very good game with 4. Never played with 3 or tried the official variant for 2, but I think it will be a very different game. In Princes of Florence you really need to have a long term strategy and you  really need to be able to adapt it as you go along.

I really don't understand the complaints about the lack of player interaction.

Auction game with tons of ways to victory (and defeat). Your turn is limited compared to the number of stuff you should be doing. I felt as is I was never able to do even half of that what the others did..
And just at the end I noticed that my only survival move, which would have given me a couple of points to end up second last, was a move I wasn't able to do, oh the joy!
Still, I plan do try this again next year!

Liked it. Need to play it more to get the strategies though. Joker seems to be too valuable to miss or let anyone get cheap. A shame that there is one "good" that always gives points. Makes it too easy to win if you get many jokers.
After one more play I now say that this game is too boring. You cannot affect the other players, except marginally with the auctions. The actions are free for everyone. Also the turns go too slowly with a lot of down time. Shame , since the mathematical, optimization of points, parts is quite nice. A lot of ways to gain points. But again the cards decide a lot. If you get a good bonus card, you can really get a high point work out and get further  3 points for best work. If your unlucky with the bonus card draw, well, bad for you.

One of the first euros I played, but it's been months since I've had it out. I would love to play it again now that I've seen a much broader range of games.

Update: well, played this last night (with P&M expansion). Verdict: excellent! Strategic planning, tense auctions, limited actions - good stuff. A lot of the tension comes from the interaction in the auction phase and competition for limited resources. I'm definitely better able to appreciate this one now, particularly playing it with a group of like-minded gamers. Looking forward to more plays.

Oh my gosh, I opened the box and saw all the building pieces and was immediately transported back to Antiquity.... except without all those graves mucking things up. Really enjoyed this game, which involves building buildings and recreational facilities for artisans, who earn you prestige points and money based upon how happy they are with the facilities. 

I liked this game with two players and can imagine I'm going to boost the rating when I get a chance to play with more since the auctions will be much more competitive.

Edit: Liked with more players, tight economy.  One false move could easily cost you the game.  There is a little more luck of the draw in some places than I would prefer, but you can largely choose to ignore those paths.

This game remains as one of the most unusual, and that is part of its appeal.  There is an urge to tinker, but never an instinct that the tinkering will make it better.  The only thing that prevents me from rating it a '10' is the fact that the jester's price ends up being nearly fixed at a high price among knowledgable players.  There seem to be a lack of options in the way of strategies that don't require a jester.

Lots of short-term vs. long-term management, several ways to score.  A few opportunities for interaction: auctions, recruitment cards, and freedoms that run out.  Not very intuitive - it took one of our regulars a while to get it, and he almost quit early on.  He said he enjoyed it by the end.  One of the all-time greats.  After several plays it has won over the crowd.

I can imagine playing this one frequently.

I think this is the most brilliant design ever. It's second only to Power Grid on my Top 10 list. I just wish it played as well with 3 players as it does with 4 or 5.

I invest a lot of thought and attention during Princes of Florence, though, and for some reason this game clicks firmly with me.  I find it amazingly balanced.  There is less interaction here than in many games, it is true, but it sure does neatly avoid kingmaker problems as well as you can expect a game to.  Although I generally avoid the builder strategy, once it propelled me to first place in a very competitive game.  During other players' turns I was playing tetris in my head trying to make things fit. GREAT GAME.

I like the tension of the inbuilt commentary of what is needed to advance, the trackable status and the surprise prestige awards at game end. Your 21 decisions are memorable and so you find yourself reflecting on where you went wrong. The Showmanager angst of losing prestige to get money is another nice feature. But at least 4 players makes it ideal for competition for limited resources, but game pace issues creep in, as auctions coupled with two actions per turn (with which some requires you to evaluate 5 text cards)can bring the pace to a halt. And then there is the long winded adding performance when showing works and the comparative attitude is hindered by the spatial placements of important information. A shame really as this is a safe, none threatening game that Amanda (my wife) enjoys.

This is a game of planning. You play 7 rounds, and in each round you do an auction for powerful tiles and cards, and then an action phase where each player gets 2 actions. One of your action options is to build a building, which has to fit on your little tetris style board. Another option is to score a card, which can give you credits that you either take in any combination of money or in actual points at a rate of 2 credits for 1 point. In order to score a card, it must be worth at least the min value for that round, which goes up every turn. The cards score more depending on how many things and what things you've built. This all works out to be a very tight and tense game of budgeting and planning. It's a delightful thinky old euro that desperately needs a face lift. I bought a copy of the Italian Edition that has nicer art, so my copy had a strange hodge podge of that and the English version, due to the game having language dependent cards.

Great game with a lot of good choices to make.  Many paths to victory, but the best path is often changing, which will you choose?  Not played too many times, but I have enjoyed it each time.  Definitely need to play it more, but we have so many good games within our gaming group, that it's hard to get in games of everything we have.

My review would go up to a 9 when playing on BSW as the game itself is so much fun. Problem stems from not remembering to give players points and realizing 2 turns later that you didn't give them the points. Which tends to turn new players off and decrease the likelyhood that they will want to play again. Which means I won't be playing this one much in real life. Thank god for BSW. (7)

Update: Upping this to an 8. It is a perfect length and and has great deep gameplay. It will not go higher than that due to the upkeep problems and the confusion with regards to points (work value and prestige points.) It is just simply not fun realizing that you are playing with the wrong rules even though you have played with the correct rules in the past. If they ever reprint this game, they have to make the two systems stop sounding so much the same.

Nice tile laying/puzzle subgame within the main game. Plays fairly fast. Strategy to counter opponents (ability to influence others) is very very subtle and requires the most effort for effective play. Essential, in my group, to use the BGG tile mat to keep the tiles sorted. It would have been nice if the text leaned less towards stylistic and more towards legible.

Very good game of planning, adaptation to circumstances, and resource management. Patience is a virtue as production works later rather than sooner seems to be the way to go. Minimal screwage although there are some opportunities for bidding up or poaching essential items. It is ESSENTIAL to obtain at least 6 profession/recruiting cards to have any chance to win.

The theme in PoF, based on renaissance Italy, is not necessarily something that appeals to everyone. And while there is plenty of conflict in the game thanks to limited resources and an auction mechanism to get those resources, the conflict is also indirect.

You aim to create a palace and its associated landscapes, buildings etc. such that you maximize the "work value" of tasks completed by various illustrious professionals such as poets, artists etc. The game requires thinking ahead in terms of hand management to not just complete tasks in the current round, but also in future rounds.

Although it can play upto 5, I think the sweet spot is 3 because there is enough in-game text that can lead to some downtime between turns. (This may be somewhat lessened if all players are very familiar with every available card and how it can be best used.)

I can see why it popular. Very much an efficiency puzzle and a nice blend of action and auction. The actions especially are very limited, so you have to take advantage of each one. Auctions provide some options but it is easy to get blocked. I like how the rewards can be split between money and points early money is good later it is definitely points. Also the draw 5 select one reduces the luck of the draw effect, most times you can find something that will work with your position.
Long term planning with some flexibility in approach is important.

First impression of a two player game with the 2P variant. May be not the best two player game. I can see the potentiel of a multi-player game of 4 or 5 player. There his a lot of strategies possible to win the game.
Will need to play it more in order to confirm my rating.

update: Game with three players. More interesting with much more interactions. Can't wait to play a four player game. I think it's going to be even better.

Update: Game with four players. Getting better and better. Now the auction phase gains all it's importancy. Upgraded the rating from 7.8 to 8.3. Can't wait to play a five player game.

Première impression suite à une partie utilisant la variante officielle pour deux joueurs. Ce n'eest peut être pas le meilleur jeu à deux mais on peut voir le potentiel pour des partie à plusieurs joueurs. Il y a plusieurs stratégie possible pour gagner. Je vais devoir y rejouer pour confirmer mon score.

Mise à jour: Partie à trois joueurs. Plus intéressant avec plus d'interactions également. Je suis impatient de jouer une partie à quatre. Je sent que ce sera encore mieux.

Mise à jour: Partie à quatre joueurs. Le jeu est de plus en plus plaisant. Maintenant la phase d'enchères prend toute son importance. J'augmente la note de 7.8 à 8.3. J'ai bien hâte de jouer une partie à cinq joueurs.

Recently upgraded my rating to a 10. This is a masterwork. There is a thoughtfulness about this game that is quite appealing, without being of the brain-busting variety. There are so many possible paths to victory,  and all strategies are viable. It comes down to playing the other players, primarily in the auction. Player interaction is very subtle here, but does exist.

RATING: N/A
Yet another Previously Owned Euro. It wasn't terrible, it flowed smoothly (it's Kramer; what do you expect?), and it featured things I normally like: auctions, polyominoes, simple rules, and clear goals. Strategic Euros simply stopped getting played, and there's no way I wanted to hang on to something that only saw action once every two years. 

Despite it being "the game that ruined Eurogames" or whatever Michael Barnes called it, I don't think it's that objectionable. It's even enjoyable, if a bit dry. But I don't think it's a fair representation of the sorts of dry, convoluted, solitaireish games that dominated Eurogaming for a while. I think games by Stefan Feld and Vital Lacerda should get more blame (or credit?) for turning Euros into overcomplicated, solitaire, tactical point grabs. Princes of Florence is driven by player interaction, is simple, and moves very cleanly. It's honestly not that bad.

Only played this once. Auctions are a bit vicious. However, I can’t stand games in which the only person you can really screw over is yourself. Because there are so many fiddly rules and scoring constraints, screwing yourself over is quite easy to do if you are still unfamiliar with the rules or spatially challenged. I probably won’t buy this for myself since I usually have only one opponent. Rating would probably go up if I ever have the chance to play this more often.

The atmosphere of the game is fantastic too.  Great production quality and lots of different track to success.  This is one of those games like Puerto Rico where you have to adjust your strategy each and every turn.  I love this one. It's TOP 5 without a doubt.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play and observing others, and reading about it a lot - I'm shocked this game is rated #7. It is a flawed game that has more luck than people are admitting. Among equal players, the winner is likely whoever gets the Professions that work the best together. End of story. 

Add in the [b]facts[/b] that it's a "rich get richer" game (where the leader will be getting the most money, which allows him to outbid people) and that it is simply not designed for 5 players (there simply are not enough Professions to work - they get used, and then the last 3 rounds it's all about the Recruiter auction). It shows me that the main reason this game is so well regarded is the group-think of BGG : it came out in 2000, and was played a lot in early BGG, well-rated at the time, and that influenced years of followers to play it, and rate it high so they could be agreeing with the enlightened BGG crowd.

This game seemed like it would have a feel to it reminiscent of Puerto Rico, Caylus, or Princes of the Renaissance (that stands to reason), but I felt frustrated at every turn in both games I've played. Last game, I essentially sat out the last three turns, my only options for actions all being clearly stupid to take, as I watched other players continue playing.  I might try it again, maybe, but NEVER AGAIN in a five-player game; it just seems to me that one or more players will always be completely frustrated, and I don't care to spend two hours feeling frustrated and powerless.  There are SO many better games than this, that I don't have time to waste on this one. LATER: I played again, another 5-player game, and scored better but still felt frustrated most of the game.  No change in the rating.

A real grower. Didn't grasp it at all the first few times I played, but really enjoy it now (though only gets table time once a year!) for its clever mix of maximising your resources through bidding power. Tough, tight game with five players - bit too easy with three. Requires a lot of decision making that can result in frustration or much satisfaction - never been as pleased to win a game! I felt I really earned it. One of Alea's and Kramer's best.

Very tight auctions, well - themed.  We play with a Goa-style threaded actions variant where each player takes 1 action, then after everyone has had an action, they take their 2nd action.  Although this does change the game and you have to remember that certain actions can't be taken twice, the decrease in downtime is worth it.  Must be played with 5 players though.

very strategic games with almost no luck involved, save maybe the cards you can draw, but since it's 5 you get to choose from it breaks even that. Brillantly designed, i can see why the more experienced boardgamers like this one so much. A game i can highly recommend anyone, even for the not-so-experienced ones since the game rules are quickly explained.

I own the QWG version which is amazingly illustrated, but the cards are not of the same graphic quality. Typical ystari yucky pastel colours which do not fit the game at all. Love the fact that the two expansions are already inclued in this version.

I love Princes of Florence.  So many ways to try and win, so little time.  One of the reasons I like this game is that I can't find the "best" way to play it.  Sometimes I go for more jesters, sometimes for more builders, sometimes for bonus cards, etc.  They all seem viable - I just keep thinking if I play one more game I can figure it out.  Yet, I can't, and that is what keeps bringing me back.  

The auction is fun, trying to fake folks into thinking you want one item when you really want another.  I also like the building placing aspect.  I always enjoy games where I "build" something - whether it be a city, or an empire, etc.  The layout of my villa gives me that feeling.

The theme of this game (patron of great works) just adds to the fun of the game - and I feel like it comes through in play.  Limited actions make for interesting choices throughout the game.  Great heavier euro game.  Some argue about multi-player solitaire, but I don't get that feeling.  I'm watching what others are doing, thinking about what they might want in auctions and trying to plan around that.  The problem with the game, and what prevents it from being a higher rated game for me, is that the auction is the crux of the game and unless price enforcement is strictly applied, the game can really break down.

This game is the first of the 'real' auction games I've played. This really is a game of long-term strategy combined with short-term tough decisions.

The Princes of Florence is one of the big, classic euros, though it requires strategy or long term planning.  The Auction sequence is integral where reading your opponents state and strategy is crucial while you bluff your way putting items up for auction and upping the bids. When and for how much do you convert cash to VPs?

The ultimate planning/bidding game.  My favorite.

RATING: 7.9
(+) Elegant mechanics. Simple set of rules, lots of opportunities. Fierce bidding game combined with a clever planning mechanism which converts earnings in points!

(+) Very reasonable gaming time: you can explain and play the game in 2 hours.

(+) We like the added opportunities offered by the free A2-expansion which is included with the base game.

(+) With our custom-made cards, the game looks better than ever ;)

(-) The game doesn't look very inviting with unclear fonts on the cards and rather boring graphics. The game also feels more 'mechanical' than 'thematic'. Our new cards help to diminish this issue.

Approx game time: Approx 20-25 min / player

Not being a huge fan of auction games, I wasn't sure I'd like it. However, I found the auction phase to be interesting. Since, each player is limited to a single auction win, there are several stategies and options that can be used during this phase. Really enjoyed my first game although it was with three players. I can see how things would get a little more challenging with four. A must for my collection.

Michelangelo has come under your patronage, great.  But in order to wrangle an excellent chapel from him, you first need a government that will support his type of art, a park and a lake by which he can be inspired, and a studio in which he can paint.  How nice to become a driving force in the renaissance through city planning!  A bit quiet for my tastes, but lovely.

Princes of Florence is a fabulous game and even better than I had expected after reading the reviews.  Great strategy game - low degree of randomness, high degree of difficult choices to make.  

Edit 11/07: Finally took the plunge and bought it.  I held out for a long time because I didn't think it was good enough to own since I have friends that own it.  I think I was wrong.  This is a game well worth coming back to and exploring a very elegant financial system.

First play was compelling and intriguing as we slowly discovered how interwoven and finely balanced the game is.  I suspect the rating will go up with repeated plays and better knowledge of the various prestige/bonus cards.

There were no easy decisions as multiple players were vying for same auction items, but even going into the lat turn, options always available to try to get more points while watching for what others are doing.

I'm a bit of a contrarian, but I think this game is very fiddly, not that well balanced (the Jesters are clearly more powerful regardless of strategy--if someone gets them sheaply, they'll usually win.) and as an auction game, each succeeding auction gets less interesting.

--Dec2003-- Very cool: too many things to do, in too little time.

--Sept2004-- Played this again after too long without.  Much tighter game than I remembered - probably a reflection of the players this time.  Very nice.

--Aug2005-- My dad's review: "Peaceful and fun."  Our game wasn't particularly competitive, yet he wanted to play again the next day...

On reflection, this game is one of those delightful ones where complete newbies and I can have a completely fun time attempting some suboptimal and useless strategies.  It seems to me that even in the face of wildly differing abilities, the poorer players will still enjoy the experience - rather unlike the _Puerto Rico_ or _Euphrat & Tigris_ experience.  A really nice design.

--Dec2007-- Bumped down to 8 due to lack of play.

RATING: 6
 A bit over rated in my opinion.  THe mechanics are solid and the play can be intersting, but I am not a fan of the solitare aspect, especially since the auction are not as dynamic as more recent games have shown they can be.  

Seems to me like the jesters are a bit ridiculous...  there is a mad grab for them and when you don't get one you have to change strategy...  then you only bid on them to keep them away from those that have them.

I do like this game, but its a bit too calculational. You really do want to have all 7 of your turns semi-planned out by the end of turn 2 or something, and thats just not something I want to do most games. If you don't care about winning though and just want to play a game with some bidding and interesting decisions, then you can ignore the calculation and actually have a good time with this game.

A beautiful game.  The gameplay is engrossing, the aesthetics are wonderful, and there's just enough player-interaction in the auction phase.  PoF is much more about strategy than tactics, and experienced players will have a great advantage over newbies.  (So, I would suggest that when teaching the game, the teacher should also give a primer on basic strategy.  At very least, don't let people play their first game without understanding the value of Jesters!)

I love PoF. Is there alot of player interaction? No. Is it a great game? Yes. You only have 7 chances to bid and thus 7 chances to make your game and ruin your opponents. The auction phase is crucial as every strategy requires certain items and paying too much or getting them for a great deal can be the difference between first and last. I think the game really needs 5 players to shine as this increases competition for everything, but with 5 the game is one of the best out there.

One bad player can unconsciously be a kingmaker, but when everyone knows what they're doing this game shines.

This game exemplifies the "Euro-style", which to me means it has a lot of obstacles to me liking it: there's a lot of "playing solitaire against each other", no direct conflict, and the whole game you execute some strategy and you have no feedback on whether you are doing well until the game is over and it's too late to do anything about it. I never felt like I really had a handle on what was going on and was just doing one thing after another. Also, the rule where the amount of money each player has is secret - even though the starting amount, and all revenues and expenditures are public - totally blows my mind as to how pointless it is, since it means that in order to be playing properly, each player should bring a pen and paper and track everyone else's money anyways. 

In general, Princes struck me as very similar to Puerto Rico in every regard, so if you like that game, you will probably like this one. 

I think this game would actually be really interesting if each player was writing their own AI to play against each other, but actually playing it yourself is much less enjoyable.

This is in the same boat as Puerto Rico; entirely well-designed, not that much fun to play. Puerto Rico has the slight edge over this one, because it has a slightly stronger theme, and is more intuitive. Princes is tough to catch on to, and doesn't have a lot drawing me in deeper.

It really is a take it or leave it game for me. The puzzle aspect of the buildings isn't significant enough to be interesting and that's the part I'd be more inclined to enjoy. The bidding and action selection aren't exciting.

RATING: 8
Well built Euro, which has an uncommon focus on STRATEGY rather than TACTICS. For that alone, this game has a place in my collection. You need to have a plan from turn one, and then adjust to your opponents, but you must stick with your plan. Clever use of cards means that it's unlikely everyone will be gunning for the same stuff - limiting unintentional screwage - which is a nice touch.

However, this does require everyone to know the game to roughly the same degree, and mean that you can be punished for early mistakes throughout the game. There are no catch-up mechanics.

For me this is the best of the Euro games, hands down. It's an excellent low-luck planning game, with some clever mechanics to keep the pace accelerating (increased return on builders, increasing minimum WV, prestige card goals etc). Deserves its place in the top five. If you like Puerto Rico or San Juan, you'll enjoy PoF (as it has a similar feel, but is different enough to play in the same evening as one of the above). It is quite unforgiving for new players, though.

I find PoF to be more interactive than it's given credit for, especially in the auction and recruiting mechanisms (and both of these are better with more players). The many different paths to victory should give it a long lifespan. 

The more I play it the more I like it. Best with five players, but quite playable with four. The 3P game lacks the tension of the 5P, but even so it's still interactive.

Probably the best deep euro you can play in 75 minutes. Several strategies well integrated with each other and tough decisions. Requires developing a plan for the whole game early on and sticking to it. Not much room for deviating from it, as it makes you inefficient and kills your hope of winning a tough game, but in a game this quick it's hardly a problem. Very good for finishing a serious game night when you don't have time left for anything more.

Based on one play, it left a very good impression. At the end all 5 players were very close together, which speaks for a well balanced game. The decision dilemma works good, and I didn't find it to be a "solitaire" game, what some people say. With 5 people there's communication, probably because of the scarcity of some of the pieces. Anyway, nice work from Alea.

I thought there might be a problem with the replay value of this game. I was wrong. I'm really enjoying each outing of this - trying different strategies and tweaking favourites. When other players are having their turns I'm usually thinking, so downtime is no problem for me. It's like half a game and half a puzzle that moves with actions the other players take. Experienced players polish it off in an hour, including setup and packing away time. Auction values can take a couple of games to get about right, and sometimes those have to be thrown out the window anyway less you allow a player to get away with dominating Jesters. I could highly recommend this to gamers who don't want too much confrontation in their games. It's very balanced and this keeps gamers coming back for more. Outstanding.

I really enjoy how this game allows/requires you to have a road-map for the entire game from early on. Figuring out how to combine your purchases with playing your works is an interesting puzzle.

My favorite game. Forming a plan; deciding what to bid on; forcing the jesters up, up, up; choosing actions, changing your plan on the fly--I love it all!!! 

Every time I play this it, incredibly, rises in my opinion. It is an absolutely perfect game; there's not one thing I'd change. 

People who claim this is mutual solitaire are morons. If you're not paying attention to what others are doing and what they need, and reacting accordingly, you'll lose--and you deserve to. 

Holy crap, though...do yourself a favor and DO NOT play with the expansions. They add WAY too many things to think about, and it made the game take FOREVER. When an expansion makes me hate my favorite game, you know something's wrong...

RATING: 10
This game is nothing short of brilliant, and the key to it is the auction.  If you cant get what you need at a reasonable price or if you're not flexible enough to be able to bow out of an auction or two, you'll struggle.  And why are there always two people fighting over something (usually something pretty benign like a park) in round 7?  Yes, managing those seven auctions is key.  Because of this, I think there's a lot more player interaction than most people give the game credit for.  There's multiple paths to victory, and the interplay among the different items you can buy and the scoring is just so-well thought out.  Brilliant!

The first time we played it, we played it twice in a row...This is one of the most beautiful games that I have seen and at the same time extremely strategic. 
The only reason for not giving it a ten is the small interaction between players and that there is a lot strategy involved making it somehow "heavy" for constant playing. On the other hand: various ways of winning, various mechanics, constant monitoring of other players, strategic play, beautiful components and ALWAYS the feel that you could do more even if you win are elements of a GREAT game that will hit your table more than once in any regular playing group. Give it a try...

Nice game.  I really like the bidding.  Often, it is difficult determine what you should bid in games.  Mostly because you can't tell if someone needs the object being bid on.  In PoF the information is much more transparent.  With the exception of which professionals they have in their hand, you have a good idea of what they need.  Lots of different build paths which is great.  Doesn't seem to have any _fun_ factor though.  Typical dry Euro.  Don't expect to crack a smile.

Yet another good game in the Alea line. If your games must have a "take that" aspect to them, then it may not be for you. For everyone else, ignore the "multiplayer solitare" claims and give this one a shot. Unlike most, I prefer a number of the other Alea games to this one. Its fun, but I find I'd rather play PR, Taj, or ToG than this.

A decent game, but to me it feels like it's got a lot of things wrong with it. It feels very fiddley. As yet I haven't played it enough to "solve" it, but I'm leaning towards the arguement that it's all about Jesters. It's OK for it to be all about Jesters, but I think it will get real boring real quick if I were to play it a lot.

Simple rules and fast game play make this an enjoyable game to play.  After several plays however, the game seems repetitive. This game is basically 4 player solitaire where you compare scores at the end.  Low replay value.  About a 9 the first several times you play, then falls off to a 5-6 rating as you discover there is only one way to win (the jesters).

Staring into the abyss of "the game that ruined eurogames". Yup it is this one. Definitely. It's not as bad as a game, but bringing to mind all of its offspring and the mainstream euro trend it sends shivers down my spine. 

And it's not elegant, no it still has the quirkiness of the German games of old. The puzzle part is far less straightforward than in Goa for instance, the money or points decision is very gamey and old school. There's a lot of juggling around rough edges trying to satisfy threshold for scoring which increases each round. And it's this quirkiness that give it charm - the spacial element, the very stylised graphic style, there's even some logic behind profession and it's demands (well sometimes). 

The jury's still out (only played solo, I have to see the downtime problem, which probably balances with all the AP the juggling produces). 
It's educational. Happy not to own it.

[6 plays] 5 player rating = 11, 4 player rating = 9, 3 player rating = 5.

I'd like to play this every 2 months with a steady group for a while. I think it would really shine in that scenario. Each player would experiment with different strategies and the bidding would be very tight and tense. 

PoF is a beautiful and classic game that deserves regular play. The brilliance of the game is in the auction, the choice between points and money, and the way it all meshes.

Fairly dense auction game where players bid on items worth points towards completing 'works'. The base costs for completing works gets harder each round. Toss in a tetri minigame of arranging pieces on a gridded board and some special effects cards and you get PoF.

RATING: 9
An average game at 3 players, great at 4 players and awesome at 5 players. If you are able to get a 4-5p group then this is an amazing auction game. It is extremely tense -- do you put up what you want for auction, or do you put up something else hoping to pick up what you really want for cheap? Do you pay lots of money for that thing you want, or do you try to pick up cheap items? Do you take money or VPs? Do you enter the auction just to drive the price up, but risking that you might be stuck with the item?

You have only 7 rounds, which means you can only get seven items from the auction pool through the whole game. Getting any one means foregoing something else and because its an auction you have to deal with the bidding of every other player. So getting what you want is not guaranteed at all. When do you drop out of the auction and pick up something else? And how much impact does that have on your strategy?

Tough questions, tough decisions and tense bidding. Amazing game.

One thing: Don't bother with the Princess and Muse expansion that is also in the box. It just makes an elegant game unnecessarily complicated.

Talán megint abba a pechbe futott bele a játék, mint sok más öreg az én esetemben, azaz, hogy sokára próbáltam kis a megjelenése után. De sajnos azt kell mondanom több dolog nem tetszett a játékban, mint ami igen. A játékosok saját udvarukat építik, épületeket, erdőket, tavakat, parkokat hoznak létre. Építőmestereket, udvari bolondokat szerződtetnek és szabadságjogokat szereznek. Ezek mind-mind arra szolgálnak, hogy egy-egy művész különböző műveket hozzon létre az udvarunkban, ezzel győzelmi pontot hozva nekünk. Teljesen jól hangzó dolog, mégis nem igazán győzött meg. Kezdjük a jó dolgokkal. Nagyon kellemesen küszöböli ki a játék a szerencse szerepét. A mindig öt lapból való húzás miatt egyszer sem éreztem a játék közben, hogy nagy pechem lett volna, mert nem jutottam jó laphoz, pedig fizettem érte. A játékban kicsi a konfrontáció mértéke, bátran ajánlható akár családi játéknak is, nem is éreztem annyira nehéznek. Egyedül a pénzre kell figyelni, de jó, hogy pontokból pénzt is lehet vásárolni.
Jöjjenek azonban a kevésbé tetsző dolgok. A játék első kiadásainak kinézete nem túl szép, nagyon sok a szöveg, ami simán megoldható lett volna ikonokkal, így nehéz is az elején tájékozódni, főleg az épületek tekintetében. Fix 7 körös a játék, ami jól hangzik elsőre, de ahogy haladunk előre egyre nagyobb a holtidő a játékban és érdekes módon az éppen korábban dicsért laphúzás mechanizmusa miatt. Mivel mindig 5 lapból választunk, három esetben is, ahol tényleg jól meg kell fontolni mit vesz el a játékos sokat kell várni egymásra, főleg ha valaki két laphúzó akciót hajt végre a körében. 4 játékossal is sok volt a holtidő, lehet 5-en le se ülnék hozzá, pedig elvileg úgy a legjobb a játék. A 7 kör miatt nem mindenki ugyanannyiszor kezdőjátékos, ami elsőre nem tűnik nagy előnynek, de azért van jelentősége. Ilyen most megjelenő játékokban már ritkán fordulhatna elő. Az aukció érdekes eleme lehetne a játéknak, de úgy érzem mivel minden dolog használható valamire, sőt tulajdonképpen mind hoz győzelmi pontot is nincs nagyon értelme, maximum a végén lévő körökben nagyon erősködni az aukció alatt. Simán alapáron el kell vinni, ami marad. Talán ez a rész lehet, ami öten izgalmasabb, bár öt játékos esetén is úgy érzem ami marad, az is jó lehet a játékban. További problémám a játékban levő stratégia lehetőségek száma. Én úgy érzem egyértelműen a legjobb mindenből kicsit elvet követni, bár lehetnek ettől eltérések valahogy nem érzem többutasnak. Ezt persze illene több játék után megítélni, de valahogy úgy érzem nincs túl sok lehetőség a játékban a sok épület és aukció alatt szerezhető dolgok ellenére sem.
Egy nagyon magasan jegyzett játék a Firenze hercegei, nekem mégis csalódás volt. Biztos belejátszott a játék puritán kinézete és a sok holtidő, illetve, hogy a játékot nem a megjelenésekor tudtam kipróbálni, de valahogy nem érzem például annyira időtállónak, mint mondjuk az általam szintén nem annyira magasztosított El Grandét, de annál valahogy éreztem miért annyira népszerű, ennél egyáltalán nem. Ettől függetlenül nem szeretnék lebeszélni róla senkit, mert nem rossz játékról van szó egyáltalán.

I can see why people like this methodical and clinical game, but it's not really for me.  Very little interaction (you play your board like solitare) except for bidding.  But even in the bidding, you just bid for what you need and sometimes you get lucky and get stuff cheap, sometimes you don't. You can only make choices in the auction based on what other people have made on previous turns, but personal goals are just too important to give up in order to counter what your oponents may (or may not) be looking for.  It is just too risky to bid up things you don't need. The real bone, of course, is if you don't manage your money or prestige correctly you get to wait around and do nothing for a long time.  

Worst of all is the downtime.  After you are out of the auction there is some serious sitting and waiting time until your turn comes around.  Because of the way the game is set up, you can't really do simultaneous personal turns (like Goa).  

It was innovative for its time but after Puerto Rico and Goa this game has become obsolete. Also, should win an award for worst font in a game, everything is quite difficult to read.  

Dry and Boring.

I bought this sight-unseen. The money vs. score dynamic is interesting, and is much more to my liking than the similar dynamic in Medici, which I hated. The amount of hidden information is just enough to keep a few surprises and prohibit overanalysis. Additional plays are definitely important to get a handle on the strategies. There seem to be several strategies that are equally valid.

This is an excellent example of a game that, in my opinion, is a classic in every sense of the word but has been replaced and redone to make it better in the future.  I recognize fully that the game was great in its time.  But playing it 14 years later after release I just can't get into it.  I feel like Colosseum, who PoF is always compared to, is actually quite a different game indeed.  Scoring throughout really changes the way to play.  A good game by all accounts.  Would have played the crap out of it 14 years ago.

Excellent game! I've had lots of fun with this game but my last playing left a bitter aftertaste. I got the feeling there isn't many viable strategies and that most of this game comes down to calculating. Not that calculating ain't fun, but it's not 9/10 fun. I hope I'm wrong.

Overrated in my opinion, mostly because it plays best with 5 players, okay with 4 but not so good with just 3. That's not to say it's a bad game. It's good, but not as good as it ranking implies.

I've heard this game compared to Puerto Rico and I'm gonna call BS on that.  I just did not care for the way this game played at all luckily I didn't buy it a friend did and he apparently loved it so much he auctioned it off 3 months later.  Certain Euro games are hit and miss for me and this game just didn't do it for me like Goa or Puerto Rico.  All in all not a bad game but just one I can't see myself enjoying or playing it again.

Great auction game where you're trying to produce the best works.  There's plenty of things to try and do, and you seem constantly faced with agonizing decisions over what to bid on, how much to bid on it, and then what to do with your actions.  This might even be a 9, but there is a little too much downtime.  Perhaps playing with a set of people that are familiar with the game would speed up the pace.

The game that began my Euro decline. I played it with a guy who basically broke the game down into numbers and speechified about optimal moves and the value of that move over this move. Turned what I thought was an okay game into a meatless, flavourless sack of numbers.

I never liked the guy, but I owe him a debt of gratitude for exposing the weakness of that school of games and allowing me to seek out different styles.

For the game that ruined eurogames, Princes of Florence is surprisingly good.  Armed with cynicism born out of experience with countless dry mechanical euros, I expected a much blander game with much less interaction.  It turns out that Princes of Florence is a deep strategic eurogame.  When you compare it to a lot of what gets released these days, it's almost intuitive.  It's also, dare I say it, fun.  Looks aside, I think this game has aged much better than, say, Goa--or Puerto Rico, for that matter.

RATING: 7
It's no small source of regret that I have yet to play this.

Update: Finally got a chance to play the Princes of Florence. The rules explanation was straightforward, other than perhaps the strange WV/PP exchange rate. The difficult part was knowing how much things were worth, and what to do with the limited actions. In the end, it was a close game. Only played it with 3 players, so I know I didn't get the full experience, and I can imagine how much better it is with 4 or 5 players. Still enjoyed learning the game, though. It had been on my 'unplayed' list for a very long time.

I love this game, but the Recruiting card I feel was a mistake. I feel like you are at the random whim of your opponents, and you constantly have to keep track of your opponents cards in order to effectively use them. It is a little distracting, and they offer too much power not to be ignored.

For now, it's a five.  I'm sure I'll play it again someday, and perhaps that will get revised.  I don't see it, but ya never know.  I was just plain bored and unengaged.

One of those games that was always at or near the top of my "Really want to play" lists.  When I finally had the chance to play, it lived up to the hype!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire game, trying to accomplish your goals while keeping an eye on your opponents.  
A great game I'm always willing to pull off the shelf (if I had my own copy).

RATING: 7
The simplest breakdown of this game is that it is played in a series of 7 rounds with two phases, the first phase is an auction and the second phase is playing Tetris.

In more complete terms this is an optimization game where you acquire different pieces and parts for your player area representing your estate in Florence, trying to earn the most prestige points (victory points) by game end.  The game lasts seven rounds and there are two phases in each round.  The first phase is an auction.  It is a really simple auction where every starting bid is 200 florin and each increment is 100 florin until there is a winner.  There are 7 different items available for auction and only one of each can be won each turn.

The second phase is the action phase.  There are a few different actions you can take here but everything is in the service of constructing a great work.  Each player has profession cards in their hand and by playing one of these cards during the action phase that person constructs a work of art.  The value of this work is determined by the things you have collected at your estate and each round of the game has an increasing requirement for minimum work value.  Also, the total value dictates how much money you will receive for the work, which can also be exchanged for prestige points, and the most valuable work at the end of each round earns a point bonus as well.

I think this game has a decent amount of depth.  There are a lot of different decisions to be made at different points from which items to put up for auction, how much to spend, to even where to place items in the limited space in your estate so you don't block yourself off in the future.  There are multiple opportunities to earn points so you can play differently and refine your game each play.  It also plays at a reasonably fast clip.  There can always be AP to slow the game down but for the most part the turns can go by pretty quickly.

The art design leaves something to be desired for me but I do like the insert (I have the Alea big box series version).  I also think it is reasonably accessible with a thin and straightforward rules set, plus everyone knows the rules to Tetris.  This makes it a great, quick, entry level auction and optimization game that seasoned gamers will enjoy as well for the opportunity to fine tune their game play.

I've only played twice so I haven't even come close to figuring this one out.  There are so many variables to consider and how they fit together so it's difficult to know how much something is worth for the auction.  Unfortunately, I rarely have 4 or 5 people together so I may never figure this one out.

Very good game. I love the theme presented in it. Very well balanced. Tough to win.

PORTUGUÊS: O jogo começa por ter um tema muito bonito - ser o Príncipe de Florença promovendo cultura. Gosto da produção, a mecânica é muito simples de entender embora seja um jogo difícil de vencer. Muito equilibrado em todas as suas componentes. O leilão e a escassez de alguns recursos valorizam a interactividade entre os jogadores, embora este não seja propriamente um trunfo do jogo. Se tivesse uma maior interactividade seria um jogaço!

Despite the aging PoF still is one of my first picks when thinking about a 5 player game. I really loved the game from the first time I've played it. The theme made things easier to me although in the end this is an abstract game. No matter what I think PoF is one hell of a game, medium weight, good to introduce to newbies but also appreciated by gamers and above all of this is a very elegant game with few but strong and very well combined mechanisms. A must have in any collection.

Played again after several months/years and still like it. A classic. I understand that some of the mechanisms may seem a bit old and dated but I really still enjoy to play it. There are no secrets in the strategy anymore but an occasional play is the solution.

Adore this gem of a game! What I consider to be a gamer's gateway. Have had success introducing the game to both non-gamers and casual gamers. Simple rules broken into 2 simple phases yet a myriad of paths to victory. This is a huge plus for me. An efficiency game that doesn't feel dry - adequately thematic. Spatial mechanic is a great addition. Rewards good and smart play. Only downer is that I refuse to play this game with anything less than 5 - auction isn't near tense enough and scoring tends to be inflated.

You get to be a patron of the arts, which I find ridiculously hilarious and improbable.  Then you get to spend your money building fancy buildings where your artists hang out and parks and gardens where they wander and Think Hard About Beauty.

All that aside, I like this game.  I find the building placement to drag on the pacing a bit, but overall I enjoy it.  It's easy to teach and to learn without being too easy to play.

One of the best games by Kramer, and that is saying something. PoF is playable in 60-90 minutes, but for such a short game, it's surprising strategic. By turn 3 or 4, you should have a clear idea on what you're going to do in the second half of the game, and make sure you have the necessary resources. Many say that it's only really great with 5, but I always enjoy playing this, regardless of the number of players.

RATING: 5.5
Holy heck, I can't believe what a high rating this game enjoys!  That's why I no longer put a huge amount of faith in the ratings on this site.  This was another brain-burning, painfully dry Euro-style math exercise that is pretty much the opposite of what I tend to enjoy in a game.  And it was one of the least visually-appealing games that I've ever played ("Indonesia" is a notable exception), with the art style making much of the text difficult to read.  I'd pretty much rank it on par with "Notre Dame" (another shockingly popular game!) as far as level of fun and visual appeal goes (which clearly isn't very far).  [Edit: I've upped my rating a bit after a second play.  I can now appreciate the many nuances that come together to create this rather complex game.  Both games have been played with a full 5 players, and I can imagine that playing with fewer would decrease the tight competitiveness.]  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

I understand now why Princes of Florence is poster-child/whipping-boy for the worst features of eurogames -- a tense, difficult game with multiple auctions and scarce resources, it is also a dry, themeless work simulator rendered in shades of brown.

Much as I can appreciate the difficult decisions involved, I strongly dislike the core "work value" system -- arbitrary point values for building or purchasing arbitrary sets of stuff -- as well as the various random cards awarding work value or prestige for having different variations of things in those arbitrary sets.

It's a good game but there is nothing in it for me to love and no reason to choose it over other games.

[5 plays] It is a decent low luck, pretty straight forward game with different strategy options, and an interesting theme.  I really like this plotting, planning, calculating type games.  Figure out how to setup better than the other players and out plan and auction them.  The auction takes a couple plays to figure out the right value for things.  The more I have played this game the tighter the games have become.  The game really does revolve around the auction phase.  The trick is to force people to overpay for the "great" things available each auction, while at the same time getting good deals on the things you need to attract the professions you are trying to lure to your city.

RATING: 7
[RGG 2000 Edition] {Medieval, City building, economic; auction, utility card; optimal 4+p} PoF is a gamers' game. It is a multifaceted game - there are multiple paths of victories and no single strategy will forever work. PoF has a good balance - there are no overpower cards and the luck is well controlled. The drawing top-5 card is useful to reduce luck but it's quite artificial. Players have to take care of many things: money, buildings, cards and layout of the principality, which is not easy. It is very unforgiving; thus, it's not suitable for new players.

There is enough player interaction during auctions and competition of resources; however, the interaction is not strong enough to engage all players.

The rule is clear and easy to understand. The theme is unique and works well, which makes PoF intuitive.  Everything integrates with the game nicely except the Bonus cards, which I find them awkward in the game (it seems to be an artificial product to balance the game or to let players have alternate ways to complete a work).

A true classic. I find the tacked-on theme very appealing and actually enjoy the much commented on "multiplayer solitare" aspect. It gives me a great opportunity to try a different strategy without sudden derailments by other players.

Not as much interaction as some people would like, but I never find it slow or boring.

Down from a 10 to a 9 as I just never get it on the table anymore.

RATING: 5
The overall feel of the game is very bland. The systems are very straight forward. Knowing what is more valuable just from playing it more seems to be the core of the game. There's also a bit too much luck in "needing cards that synergize but don't infringe on what opponent's need." Just feels like it is solvable to a large extent at which point it is all about the luck in the draw and the luck of playing the right high value work when no one else is.

RATING: 8.2
With 5 players this is about the best game you can play. It offers some complexity and different strategies for the dedicated gamers, but is at the same time rather easy to understand and thus can be a favourite among non-gamers, too.
However, it's significantly worse with less players, 4 being still ok, 3 boring and 2 just horrible and completely uninteresting.

RATING: 7
A fun bidding and buying game. It's worth playing if you haven't yet. Compared to something like High Society, there's some hidden information and interaction involved that keeps Princes from becoming a calculator-fest. Unfortunately it got "solved" in about 5 plays.

A fun logistic game with a good auction aspect.
You fellow gamers are interacted with but not in a confrontational way. Well not usually.
Not a mind melter but you do have to think about plans for the future and contemplate alternative courses of action.
Good game

RATING: 8
Renaissance-themed Euro that combines a variety of mechanics such as auction and tile-placement. Like a number of games of this type you're playing against the game rather than your opponents and interaction with other players is minimal (apart from the auction section). Like most of the best games of this type, you constantly feel as though there aren't enough turns to do everything that you want to, which in turn makes it a very strategic game as you can't afford to waste a move. This of course means that it's very unforgiving on mistakes and a single poor decision can mean the difference between winning and losing. Runaway leaders can also be difficult to reel back in.

Excellent game though the component quality left a little to be desired.  The tokens & build tiles should have been on thicker stock.  

I didn't realize the jester's potential until bidding went up to $500-700 for him. I barely snuck out the victory by teaming up three bonus cards and creating a work valued at 30 in the last round.  Eagerly awaiting another play.

I have not played enough to see its greatness, but i can see why many people see Pof as their favourite game. Nice board, intense bidding and limited actions with a nice theme makes its an attractive game. May raise the ratings with more plays. 

Update: beginning to enjoy its elegance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm sure this was Earth-shattering when it came out. Now, it's a little flabby, not too pretty and doesn't hold my attention, but what it does, it does pretty well (see Puerto Rice for another example).

Solid but unspectacular.

Update: On a second play, many years later and where there isn't one clearly more experienced player who hoovers up all of the jester tiles uncontested, this is a much better game. I'm actually surprised how well it has held up over the years. I'd certainly change the font used and it's far from pretty or thematic, but it's a wonderful little bidding game.

Rating up from 7 to 7.5.

I've played several times, and enjoy it with one exception. It appears that there's one way to play the game "correctly". Amongst players who have studied the "correct" way, I'm told it comes down to who bids the smartest. In that case, I'd rather play an auction game that doesn't have a lot of extra stuff involved. Among players who don't know the "correct" method, I find the game to be enjoyable and have some nice variety and planning to it.

RATING: 10
The auction and buying phase, combined with the tetris-like placing of your buildings, make this a great game. Scoring is tight, and you never know just who will win thanks to bonus cards. My only complaint is that the theme and artwork are really dry.

RATING: 7
Deep game, but auctions can sometimes be tough to really calculate the value for.  Lots of decisions in this game affect the outcome. Needs several plays between the same players to become a more balanced game.

Played this with the Princess & Muse Expansion.  Really enjoyed it.  I'd like to give it a couple more plays, but I can see it becoming necessary for play now.

I've only played this game a few times now, but it seems overrated to me.  Perhaps once I know the strategies better it'll go up in rating.

Based on my experiences so far, I find it to be very overrated by other BGGers.

RATING: 7
A gift from my 2006 Secret Santa (thank you Secret Santa!), a game I've had my eye on since I played it in a few different game groups.  A game that is truly best with 5 players, but in cases where the game isn't "ideal" (with newbies, or a learning game, etc.) fewer players is fine.  Sometimes dinged for being "multi-player solitaire", it is true that the actions themselves do not affect the other players.  Like Goa, this game shouldn't be thought of as "A strategy game that uses auctions" but rather, "An auction game that uses strategic actions."  The auction is the key (well, only) method of interaction, and it is not only in knowing how much a given item is worth, but, like in Power Grid, what item to choose to auction at the right moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Even with this being played with only 3 players I can tell it has staying power in my rotation. I'm sure it would be better with 4 or 5 but the odds are I won't get the chance to ever play it with 5. At least in the next five years or so until my son gets older. But there are so many interesting decisions in this game and it looks likely that it will not play the same twice in a row. Big thumbs up for this one.

Update: Played it with 4 and things are much much tighter. The bidding got pretty carried away at some points. It also seemed like the original distribution of the profession cards had a slight outcome on the endgame. I guess I could have bought some of the recruiting cards to off-set my disadvantage but there was never a right time to do so.

03 DEC 2010 - Have been able to play this 2-player. It plays fast and I really enjoy it this way. I think more players is still better with the auctions, but 2-player doesn't disappoint (used the 'official' variant)

Had really been wanting to play this and finally got chance @ Gamestorm 2010. Really enjoyed it (although apparently was taught a couple of rules incorrectly). After, I picked up my own copy but have yet to play it again.

Princes of Florence is a wonderfully tense and exciting game.  The number of auctions (7) and actions (14) are extremely limiting, so you have to plan ahead to get everything done before the game ends.  It is better with more players, which creates more conflict in the auctions.

RATING: 9
Played twice now and enjoyed it greatly each time.  Both times played were with four players.  We missed one or two rules the first time through, but corrected the next game.  I think the bidding mechanism adds to the gameplay, although some items that attract bids in the first two turns are predictable.  (I take this as a challenge to develop a new early game strategy for bidding)  A fair amount of foreplanning is needed to account for the various professions and the various landscapes/buildings that will be needed given the limited play space for each person.  Overall, the learning curve can be a little steep at first, but I found the game to be good fun.

A classic game which our group has played for years now, although it hasn't seen much table time of late.

I love this game. Limited amount of turns available so its all about maximizing your play right from the beginning. Develop that plan early on, then watch what happens when your neighbor out bids you on that last builder! A game designed around adapting and reacting quickly. The auction each round really makes the game. 

Update 9/2015:
After several plays I'm finding the game to be too scripted with not enough diversity.  Games play roughly the same.  It's just not interesting, the auction is not enough to keep things exciting or different.

The auctions: my favourite theme. And even more if the resources are so limited, the tension can be cut by a knife.

There treats itself the topic of the "cost of opportunity” about the real business like never a great game would have imagined it in a game of board...

You can choose for diverse strategies since the mental factor is very high, them surer it is that they burst this strategy that you take weeks machinating to crush the rivals. Since you have to take many decisions in a little time, and the obligation to reorganize in every moment your strategy they do that the game is very hard.

The builders, to inspire the artists, the interactivity between the players, the duration of the shifts... the Jesters!

#----0----# 

Las subastas: mi tema favorito. Y más aun cuando los recursos son tan limitados, la tensión se puede cortar con un cuchillo.

Se trata el  tema del “coste de oportunidad” de los negocios reales como nunca lo habría imaginado en un juego de tablero… un gran juego.

Puedes optar por diversas estrategias ya que el factor mental/matemático es muy alto, los más seguro es que te revienten esa estrategia que llevas semanas maquinando para apabullar a los rivales. Ya que tienes que tomar muchas decisiones en muy poco tiempo, y la obligación para reorganizar en cada momento tu estrategia hacen que el juego sea muy duro.

Los constructores, inspirar a los artistas, la interactividad entre los jugadores, la duración de los turnos,... los Bufones!

Non-intuitive game play, little player interaction, anti-climatic auctions . . . it's taking me a few plays just to find where the fun is hidden.

A vigorous exercise for the brain, but not a very entertaining one.

Has that bland feeling that a lot of "classic" euros tend to have. I choose this strategy, so I have to make these moves. You choose that strategy, so you make those moves. If we all play our chosen strategies correctly, the victory comes down to who had the best luck during the game.

I give this a 5 because the gameplay is actually not that bad. It has bidding, a Tetris-like spatial element, and different end-game bonus conditions. I usually like those things, but they have mostly all been done better in newer, more fun games.

2/22/13 - I finally got this to the table and it didn't disappoint. There are a lot of interesting decisions in every round. I like the puzzle element added into all the other planning elements of the game. I also like how players start the game out by getting most of their building rewards in money, but as the game progresses, that is shifted over to VPs. That makes for a very good timing element.

This is a must-have for Euro gamers. It is definitely a classic. And for good reason. Highly recommended.

Build a workshop to inspire artist and scientist to make greatness. Plus jesters dance to help them too. Not sure how helpful that would be, but they seem to like it.

The game still holds up as a 10 for me. Great bidding, tight resource management, lots of variables, hidden victory conditions...and I've never won a game of it. [EDIT: I finally won a game!] Perhaps it gets tedious after MANY plays, but not in the dozen or so plays that I've had.

It took a few minutes to wrap my mind around this one, but after a full playthrough I find myself looking forward to my next game.

Like a good Euro, there are always a handful of actions you want to take and very few you are actually allowed to do. The initial auction is neat, as is the Patchwork-like tableau building. As is the ability to translate cash you earn into victory points.

Dang, as I type this out I'm realizing I really like Princes.

RATING: 8
Very interesting auction game.  The general difficulty with learning and playing auction games is that a play or two is needed before you can competently evaluate the value of things being auctioned.  In PoF, that didn't really seem to be the case -- part of that was an excellent rules explanation, but part is clearly the accessibility of the game, which I appreciated.  That also doesn't mean that it lacks depth and replayability.  I found this a very enjoyable game and would gladly play again.

RATING: 10
I've read many comments on how Puerto Rico is "the game" for their game group.  Ours is Princes of Florence.  Winning Princes of Florence in our game group is accomplishing something special.  It always gets played when someone calls for it, and a more competitive game can't be found.  The way this game punishes mistakes is brutal in a closely contested game.  Brilliant.  Sheer Brilliance.  There is downtime, it just normally concurs to when having to time to plan out your game is a good thing.  Plays slow early and quickly gains speed.  Just about perfect.



This game defines multiple paths to victory for me.  In our group, the only sure fire way to lose, is to use the strategy employed by the last victor.  All of the other players will realize what is going on, and up their bids making you pay too much.    The conflict between needing a long term strategy, but at the same time staying flexible to scarf up "The Game Winning Bargain" that always seems to pop up in some weird fashion.  Being able to integrate that buy into your plans is essential.

Amazing blend of auction, action, and puzzle mechanisms.  Outstanding mix of theme with brain-burning gameplay.  I like how the game minimizes luck by allowing players to draw the top five cards from each stack and pick one.  Finally, very high replayability due to the many possible paths to victory.

A great strategy game that's easier to explain than PR. It's best to play with 4 or a full compliment of 5. A full group eliminates the "solitary" feel, and often the auctions are brutal, but fun.

RATING: 10
Some people call it multi-solitaire. I like it much better than that. True, all the interaction is in the auction, but that interaction has very chaotic (in the good, butterfly sense) effects on what happens afterwards, and there's plenty of challenge in figuring out how to do the best you can with what you have.

RATING: 7
Fun auction-based strategy game where players complete works for money/victory points. Each turn consists of an auction phase and then two actions. The 21 artists have things they like in common and if you can match these then each work will score more points. The 'jester' strategy, which we have recently found out about, highlights that the auction phase is the most crucial part of the round where you need to ensure you make your rivals' time as difficult as possible. I've read the game changes quite a bit from 2 to 5 players; with more players the game becomes a struggle for resources and competitors will need to adapt.

Best game I've ever played. Although simple it feels very deep (and subtle). Princes of Florence reminds me of poker more than any other game. The psychology feels similar and also the player interaction. As it contains less hidden information than poker, chance plays a smaller part in PoF than in poker so the most experienced player will almost surely win. ***UPDATE: Well, the poker resemblance has faded. This is a "pure" auction game that is best played with opponents of equal skill. ***UPDATE: Played PoF for the first time in a long while. This game is very very good. The auction phase in this game is true player interaction. Should I pay more for the jester so that my opponent can't have him? Will I be able to fool my opponent into buying the park thinking that I need it?

An excellent, but demanding, game for 4 or 5 experienced players (I don't like it with 3).  The lack of control can be a bit frustrating.  In a given round of PoF, once you win an auction, you're out; so you must then rely on your opponents to not let anyone get something too cheaply.  If they do, then it can be hard to catch up.

This game had been sitting on my shelf for over a year, since I was a little tired of German boardgame mechanisms and had only purchased this game because of its good ratings and collectibility. Recently, however, some gamer friends of mine persuaded me into bringing it along for our latest get together. And boy, am I glad they did! While playing, it occured to me that many recent games have been inspired by this beauty, but little have captured its richness of options or perfect gameplay balance. I would not be surprised if the term "turn angst" was introduced to the gamers community short after its release. Magic!
UPDATE: Played again and this time we experienced a serious runaway leader problem. Lowered my rating to a 7.

A decent game. Not as flexible as Puerto Rico, but I enjoy it. Hard to find a right crowd for it though.

My group really doesn't like this game too much. We have played half a dozen games at most and not highly requested.  A little sad since this is such a highly ranked game.

OK, after a couple more plays, this game ain't so bad, but it ain't all that hyped up either.

I played this once online, and really liked it.  The BSW interface is pretty bad, so I waited to play it in person to rate it.  When I got the game, and got ready to play it, the rules seemed hard to follow at first.  My biggest concern was that the prestige point rules were all over the place in the book.  Fortunately, the player boards have a guide.  With that, along with the quick reference above, things went very smoothly.  I had more trouble deciding what to do than normal, but really enjoyed the game.  I like the various goals, and get a feeling that there really are numerous effective strategies.  I never even got a builder, and although I did not win, I was pleased with how I was able to generate prestige with minimal building.

I finally got to play this beauty with 4 and it was an absolute blast. Okay, so it's really very noncompetitive, but that's nice occasionally and finding the correct strategy seems a bit tricky. There's always more to do than you can, which makes the game tense. Great fun!

RATING: 9
I have to admit, I was first drawn to this game because of its theme- trying to commission Great Works of Art to glorify Your City appeals to me in *many* ways.

Behind that veneer is an elegant, well-oiled system of a game that I have a decent but imperfect handle on, and will never pass up a chance to play, at least with 4 or 5.  Unfortunately, chances are very few and far between these days.  Probably the most "perfect" Euro I've ever played, possibly along with Acquire.  (Yes, I understand where some people think it's too dry, or too "solved", or mathematical or multiplayer solitaire or whatever.  Sure, it has less interaction than most of the games I love, but sometimes I'm in the mood for straight optimization with just a bit of auction screwage, and I love the theme far too much to ever find it "dry".)

Very well balanced game.  Everyone is constantly engaged in auctions for resources and buying resources.  Good competition for brinksmanship and strategy.  There are limited resources in this game so it's good to develop a strategy from what others seem to be doing then head them off at the end of the turn where possible if turns and resources permit.  There are limited game turns and number of actions that you can make by the end of the game, manage and prioritize your assets and moves carefully.  Pretty much a solid Euro game.

Tetris shapes being auctionned in Renaissance Italy! Solidly designed game but something about it doesn't seem to invite further plays for me. Maybe it's the largely pasted-on theme and fiddly play that doesn't make it stand out from other Euros out there nowadays - although it does implement its mechanisms really well resulting in a strong & balanced strategic game. I wouldn't refuse a game but it's not something I'd suggest either. Maybe a few more plays could have changed my view but with all my other gaming options in similar weights, I decided to trade - traded for Hansa at Montreal Mathtrade February 2009.

We really need to get 4 or 5 for this.

It is unbalanced... but wait, it can't be becouse you have to bid for everything.
This one is highly praised but I still dont like it.
The basic question is "how much is it worth?".
All you have to do is to bid. Something is unbalanced? Just bid more for it, so this game is (imho) poorly made but that does not matter, just bid more for the unbalanced parts!

I dont like this "workaround" and the whole basic concept behind it.
Just bidding without any "clue" behind it is just not my game...

My biggest beef with PoF (in two plays) is how poorly it scales. With 3 it was very ... meh. However, it is a vastly superior game (a '9') with the max number of players (five) where the scarcity of items make every decision agonizing. For each person less than five, I would dock its rating a point. Granted, I haven't played it with four people yet ... but I would be surprised if doing so would change my opinion.

I'd rate this higher but I tend not to like games where there's too much to do and too little time.  Too much like life I guess.  In this game you get 21 shots at actions.  You don't always get to do anything useful with them but you get them anyway.  There is so much to do in those 21 actions.  You need to plan and build your infrastructure, attain freedom and workers, put on works and most importantly gain prestige.  Too many mechanics to go into here but the jist is there is an imperfect balance between actions, money and prestige that must be attained to win.  All in all a very enjoyable game.

This one has really fallen from favor.  Unlike what I hear from most people, every time I play this I have less fun with it.  This has been getting more arithmetical and dry, and that trend is showing no signs of reversing.  Every choice is important, which means that you have to calculate out your strategy very early, and follow it closely.  More and more I am gaining an intellectual respect for this game, but losing any fun factor while I play it.  I don't think this one is all that it's cracked up to be.  I want to play intuitively, and this game is not about intuition.

This game was among the first few games that I played when I got into boardgaming. I really liked its multiplayer solitaire feel and the auctions added to the tension. I think this is a good game because with the auction, you can get shut out of valuable items which means you have to be very flexible in your gameplay.

(After 1st game, 3 players) WOW.  Lots of intriguing choices to be made during both the auction and action phases.  The 7 rounds went by quicky.  Player going third seemed to have an advantage of acting last 3 times.  Looking forward to future plays of this one to refine my strategy.  Pretty meaty game, not sure how newbies would do, but if you've been gaming for a while and have not played this one, you're missing out.

Four games and first victory after brainburning two last turns. Even after the victory I still can say that this is not a good game or that I like it. The latest game was quite painful, couple of newbies (who from my experience catch new games rather well) were totally lost during the first four rounds asking the same questions several times. Couple of bad moves during the middle game, but bit of luck and a marvelous last round when I managed to build two works and a tie from a prestige card saved the game.

In general this game really burns your brains, lots of analyzing, thinking number of rounds forward and calculating this and that make the average gamer bruiser from inside the head. Not for casual gamers.

First play - 4 players - I finally managed to get into a game of this. Careful planning and shrewd bidding is the name of the game. Only 7 rounds to score points. The auction phase allows you to pick up a few things and then the main phase (2 actions) allows you to get building and other items. Showing off works each round and prestige cards (if you got any) score the most points. I managed to show 6 works in 7 rounds. I didn't get any prestige cards and that was my undoing. I wound up in a tie for first and I had the least money (tiebreaker). I look forward to trying to wrap my brain around this again. Second Play with 5 new players. I showed them the 4-minute video on the game and then explained it to them. I managed to pick up early cheap jesters while others fought over the builders. I won easily.

Wolfgang Kramer & Richard Ulrich; involves developing medieval and renaissance cities to attract various professions, which enriches the cities culturally. Each player is given a city grid and reference chart and attempts to gain the most victory points after seven rounds. While Princes of Florence can be played with 2 or 3 players, fans of the game overwhelmingly discourage doing so, insisting that at least 4 and ideally 5 players are needed.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The mechanic of dividing your points between money and VPs is a work of genius, and I think it makes the game very fluid and organic.  Played with 5, which made the game very cutthroat, but I think that's probably the way the game is intended to be played.  The general complaint of the game is that a player can't change his strategy halfway through the game, but I don't see that as a detriment; in the end, it's all about who can be the most economical with his cards.

Played this countless times over the years with siblings and friends. Its a fairly light game that allows for enough replays to make it buyable. I'm stuck in a bit of a rut with it though as the jester strategy seems to have a fairly big stronghold on the winning strategies employed. Though our last game was a surprise when the one person without a jester won the game, so maybe it's come full circle and it's balance back out again.

I was a bit let down by this one.  I thought it would be an instant favorite!  It felt like there needed to be a few more rounds - palaces didn't get filled and in general it didn't feel like there was enough time to really build up anything.  Scoring felt a bit fiddly as well and with some actions scoring points in-game and some not it was difficult to keep track of whether you collected PP for everything.

Everyone chasing the reprint of Wolfgang Kramer's Colosseum should cool their jets and grab a copy of The Princes of Florence. While I admit the dirt brown components and tea stained cards aren't nearly as sexy as the colorful tiles and toga wearing meeples of that other game, the play is so much richer here. The general feel is the same; grab a target card and then acquire all the required tiles to meet the card's demand, usually through auctions. Of course your opponents are doing the same and each type of tile is limited to one per auction round, so every auction is absolutely cutthroat.

Money is tight and this auctions are not the only place you need to spend it. You can straight up buy Prestige Points (VP's) at times, or use your cash to boost the output of your artist's creations. Who wouldn't want to support Da Vinci? of course do that and you may not be buying anything for a while. There's also a nifty Tetris puzzle you have to create with your buildings, which adds just enough frustration to make what to build and when to build it equally agonizing decisions.

Make no mistake, Colosseum is the family version of this game. If you are a heavy strategy gamer and you like Colosseum at all, you must play this game. Trust me, you'll never go back.

Only played once so far.  The rules are very detailed but confusing at first.  For instance, the difference between PP and WV points, when to move the markers, whether you can play the same profession works card twice afetr it is face up.  I really wished I knew someone that could explain what is meant by some of the rules.  The game plays well and I like the strategy.  I just feel lost sometimes because of I am not a seasoned PoF player.

UPDATE - after playing this many more times I see the strategy of it and the rules aren't as confusing as the first times.  I think I would have given it higher ratings if someone that had played this before had coached me on how to play the first couple of times.

Great game -- you try to build up a property with buildings and landscapes, and produce great works that earn you prestige (points).

Played it 2x until now, GREAT game! Lot of stuff going on in this game, many possibilities for strategies. The auction fase was quit intense in my  games played. Looking forward to play it again! 

UPDATED: Played for the third time, won but it was a close finish... The player on the second place had 16 points (!) through Prestige Cards. I had 1 card, giving me 5 points and a marginal win by only 3 points more.

Played for the fourth time! It's getting better and better... This time with 4 players. 1 Prestige card and 2 Bonus cards gave me the victory. Recommended! Updated my rating from 8 to a 9.

Played it for the 5th time, made a crucial mistake in the last turn. I couldn't make two 'jobs'. During the ride home, the light came to me; I should have bought one more Bonus card, that would have given me a certain victory (Play 2 Bonus cards on a Job instead of 1 Bonus Card which I did). I didn't do this, because I came 100 Florins short...the light...turn in 1 Prestige Point for 100 Florins...

Next time I'll win again :)...

Great game, always a pleasure.  I think the interaction level (I'm not sure why or how, but people seem to complain about it--it's an auction game with limited resources, ferchrissakes!) is fine, and I'm always curious to see how the prevailing wind is blowing regarding Jesters and Builders.  A truly great game, but the one nit I have is that it doesn't scale all that well, and this comes up too often (we never have exactly five).

OK, more than a nit: 3p is just bad, even using the landscape grouping variant, and 4p is too loose. And the expansion, if anything, makes this worse. I think I may do the "remove some items each round". It's strange to me that such an obvious problem was never addressed properly by Kramer from the get-go.

It doesn't appeal to me at all because of the multi-player solitaire feel. Also, the theme doesn't make any sense: "Okay, so I bought an L-shaped opera house which was two times cheaper than hiring a jester, who contributes to my Composer's Work almost as much as the Lake". Huh? Also it seems that for any Artist, Scientist or whoever looking at two jesters while working helps with their work as much as working in a Library/University/Hospital or some other institution you would consider necessary to begin with. Making fun of this nonsense was the only pleasant part of this dull experience.

So close to a 10 but there is a rule in the auction which means it is only a 9. The rule: can bid without having the money, needing only to deduct points if you are successful - ie: can ruin someone else's planning with no penalty for yourself - this doesn't fit with the rest of the feel of the game. Other than that I really like the game and intend on playing it a lot more - but will I? ..... Maybe I will end up re rating it down.

Strategy auction and tile placement to buy tetrus shaped palace items to place on your personal palazzo grid. Strategic placement of these buildings or landscape features will attract artisans to create better works.  Generate work points by tallying the list of tile placements against the list of on profession cards to get more auction money or convert to prestige.  The minimum to convert work points gets progressively harder with each round. Buy freedoms for artisans to create better works. Leverage scoring with personal objectives.  Respect the puzzle but too dry for my group.

It doesn't have endless replayability but it does have more than most games I've played and I'd still play it any time with a group that want to play for more than one game (it needs a learning game because of the auction and valuation of things).

RATING: 5
The positives include close games, tough strategic decisions, a pretty board, building up a city.  The negatives include a pasted on theme, and a completist underlying structure to the game (every variable is crossed nearly fully with every other variable). I'm accepting that I like the theme to be integrally tied to the mechanics. However, I like the mechanics to be careful, elegant, and interesting. The main intellectual activities are (i) deciding how much each auction is worth; (ii) trying to manuever the auction to get the maximum value relative to worth; (iii) deciding when to cash out your projects and when to invest in them further.

RATING: 10
A beautifully designed board game where players in renaissance Italy compete to hire scientists & artisans to perform great works.  The game is full of neat decisions, tight auctions, tension, and thoughtful fun.  

A nice feature of this game is that players cannot attack one another directly.  To win a player must get all the things they need for reasonable prices and see that the other players either can't buy or overpay for what they need.  The interaction between players is in the auction and in timing.  It is a much more subtle kind of game than Risk or Chess, and that is what makes it so excellent and enjoyable.

Eén van de klassieke euro-spellen. Jammer genoeg wel één waar het thema opgeplakt is.

Spelers zijn vorsten in florence en proberen hun persoonlijke grond zo goed mogelijk in te richten om hun werklieden zo goed mogelijk te laten presteren.

Spelers proberen in een biedronde een aantal dingen te bemachtigen die alleen op die manier te krijgen zijn. Daarnaast kunnen ze ook werklieden naar hun hof halen en deze werken laten verrichten, dit levert uiteindelijk de overwinningspunten op die je nodig hebt.

De combinatie van bieding en een actiefase is er één die je weinig terug ziet en daarom dit spel al uniek maakt. Jammergeboeg nog nooit echt kunnen spelen met mensen die niet denken dat mijn manier DE manier is om het spel te winnen en dus zoveel mogelijk mij in de weg proberen te zitten.

I would play "Steam" hundred times more if I want to bid with other players for tiles/actions or change VP to money and vice versa. And "Steam" has a high interaction on the board and isn't random almost at all.
I will play "Blokus" tens times more if I would manage my tiles on the board.

Played lots of times face-to-face (with 4 or 5 players), as well as on BSW (with 3 to 5). A game with a nice thematic feel, yet a very interesting gameplay as well. Various mechanisms interact, leading to an constant and difficult choices - both in the auction and in the actions phases. The main drawback of the game would be the huge learning curve: newbies are likely to be overwhelmed and unable to plan their purchases and actions far enough ahead, and will not know how to evaluate prices correctly. However, once this step has been overcome, the game becomes really, really interesting.

The epitome of Euroness. Lots of planning to make sure your last couple of turns generate solid points. Randomness in cards drawn and how your board comes together to add replayability. Fun spatial component in laying out the board and picking shapes of buildings. No individual mechanisms are stunning but the sum of the parts is a very good game.

I love all the cool bits in this game. Remember: Money doesn't matter; the real shortage is actions. Don't every waste on auction choice on a builder.

This game is great! I don't get it that people call this one multiplayer solitaire. We had lots of interaction throughout the session. The theme is very compelling. The strategy combos are amazing and refreshing, but the game is not a brain burner. Easy to learn, easy to teach. A must have/play. Highly recommended! [Edit] 
2 player variant on BGG worth a try as well. Plays very well with 2.

Have now played it once and liked it quite a lot. One of the things that's a shame for older games is it can be harder to find people who are prepared to play if they're into the latest hotness. However, like great movies or books, the best ones stand teh test of time.

Been awhile since I have played this one but I enjoyed all of my games. My opinion and desire to play faded as I read about all the formulas used to win - what to bid on and how much to spend - do X, Y, and Z and you will win every time... I don't know... became like Puerto Rico for me... mehhh...boring. I'll play it but I'd rather play something else.

I love this game. Love the interlocking mechanics.  Love the theme and the components.  Love the aution angst... the action point angst... the "what do you mean there aren't any universitys left" angst. Is this solitaire for 5 people?  Well, it isn't Pit, but the auctions mean you have to take into account what other people are doing and act accordingly.  That's enough interaction for me.  A great work about great works.

Doesn't feel like the masterpiece it's made out to be on the geek.  The tetris-like building placement seems unnecessary and hasn't added much to the 3 or 4 games I've played so far.  I think Puerto Rico is an infinitely better game and is what I'd choose if I was in the mood for something like this.  One of the few games I actually get bored with during downtime while other people are taking a turn.  Some cool mechanics, but nothing that stands out from a design POV, and not very fun, either.

7.5 after 1 play

Artwork is somewhat bland, but functional. Game component quality is moderate, e.g. cardboard pieces are a little on the thin side. Player interaction is a moderate, coming mainly from the auction. Game mechanics are intriguing, but do not gel together very well. Keeping track of each player's played professions can be a little troublesome.

This game is a clear classic.  I don't generally like standard auction games, but at least in my first game I found it difficult to always decide on a clear value for items making the bidding quite interesting and the combination of building a cool pilatzo and trying to maximize the professions you can use with it gives just the right amount of medium weight Euro brain burn.  Good stuff, but I ended up trading it away as I have quite a glut of medium weight Euros and it just wasn't forcing its way onto the table.

I had to learn this about 45 minutes prior to playing in a tournament, ended up placing second.  Like Amun-Re, PoF relies on a lot of card drawing, but fortunately, it lets the players to choose one out of five, thus minimizing the luck aspect by allowing more choices.  Not too certain on the replayaibility factor, but I think there are plenty of different ways to score well, and I look forward to trying it again with a better strategy.

There *is* player interaction in Princes of Florence...it's just that it's extremely subtle.  The auction system is (probably) the most important part of the game...the part where you *interact* with other players!  How can someone say it's multi-player solitare?  Rating has slipped slightly because it's been (seemingly) played-out.  Will revisit once I start playing it again.

I was looking forward to get this game onto the table. I wanted the Dutch edition, but as it is out of print, it became harder and harder to get a copy. Then we found an online store who had it on stock in Belgium. Last copy available they said. It didn’t matter to me, as I intended to get only one copy. The game takes 7 rounds to play, and each round consist of 2 phases. The 1st phase is the auction phase. An auction with 2 players is something I don’t like most of the time, and the same thing is the case in this game.  It just doesn’t work very well. Then phase 2, the action phase. Each player may take 2 actions. Possible actions are:

    Erect a building for 700 florins. Action may be played 2 times. Building has to be done according to the building rules.
    Make a person come to the palace for 300 florins.
    Get a freedom for 300 florins
    Get a bonuscard for 300 florins
    Complete a work.

While the game progresses, you’ll notice that the available space on your player board becomes smaller and smaller. Will the building fit on your board? Planning ahead is the big thing in this game. Your start with a plan, which you continuously adjust while your playing. It takes a while to play a game, but time flies as you’re playing, and you probably won’t notice the time passing by. Playing this game with two, makes it a lot easier then it will be with more players. It’s fun with 2, but I think it really shines with 4.

I've tried this game with only 3 and 2, and with that player count this game feels short. 7 rounds isn't much.
I think there are a clever mechanics in this game: when you have to divide the Work Value to money and Victory points. This combined with the auction phase at the beginning of each round makes it interesting. I also like the building placement mechanic.
Looking forward to play this with 5.

I was finally able to try this with 5 and it was nice.
The game was tighter and longer. More plays needed tough.

It costed exactly 6445 HUF

PoF is a decent game but I don't really understand all the love it gets.  Maybe after a few more plays it'll make sense...

Update: I think I'm finally starting to get it.

Update: Raising my rating again from 7.5 to 8.  Great game.  Only complaint: I think they could have made the money-to-points conversion (when building a work) a lot smoother.  It has messed people up in every game I've played.

Not bad, but probably a little overrated.  It's a fine game, but it's a bit solitaire-ish for my liking.  There isn't enough inter-player activity aside from competing during the auctioning phase.  I bought this one because many people who are somewhat down on Puerto Rico claim this is a better game.  They need their heads examined (or they just suck at Puerto Rico).

Editor's revision:  Ok, this game rocks.  My friend got blown out when he played this at WBC, so he basically told us we were missing out on some major strategy in this game.  We've since played it more and it has shot up on my list.  This is an awesome game, and I may try my hand at it in WBC next year.

6/24/08 - Well shoot.  I guess I didn't want to like this game - perhaps because I wanted to feel like I was too good for it or something, but the fact is it's quite good.  It is also a pretty easy game to learn to play, it seems, which came as another surprise.  I think I've learned a valuable lesson here:  if 99% of people like something, it's probably for a good reason.  Rating raised from a 6 to a 7.

Previously:
I sort of feel like I'm at work when I play this game.  I have a bunch of stuff I have to do and elements to combine to produce a desirable outcome, but none of it is really all that much fun.  And I don't get a promotion afterward.

Some things that rehash old mechanisms are a bit of a damp squid and some are better than the sum of their parts. I don't know whty this is the case but it's true for Endeavor. I'm scared to play it too much because I suspect it will become boring and fade away quite quickly. It was good enough to rate as one of my favourite releases for 2009 but I haven't played it since!

130929 nope...never played it again and have almost no interest in trying this game again.  I'll give it a chance maybe at some point...or maybe not.

100522 I suspect the rating will go up with more plays, but I just didn't get the feeling like I want to play again.  I suspect there is a whole genre of worker placement/efficiency games that don't catch my attention even though I acknowledge they are quite good (Fresco, PR, and Endevour).

RATING: 8.5
I enjoyed Endeavor, though I must say I will need to get it on the table a few more times. This was fun. The most interesting aspect of this game is that in the opening moves, you're constantly amazed at just how BIG it is -- you're convinced that you will never make any progress, as it appears that there simply aren't enough actions to do so.

Then, magically, you're finished -- and the game is all opened up. It's quite amazing how a game can sneak up on you when you're busy playing it. THAT is the fascinating thing for me. I will pay attention to see if this remains the case with subsequent plays.

Good Solid game - plenty of strategic options, plays in about the right amount of time.  Yes, it has slavery but there is a cost and slavery will likely get abolished so it's a fair treatment of the subject.

Only after 2 3-player games but I dare say this is a very neat design. Randomly placed tokens ensure replayability (though I wouldn't mind a bit more variety in asset cards).  Towards the end you get a little brainburning as the choice and sequence of your actions do matter but overall play time is just about right (shorter than for instance Tzolkin).

RATING: 7
1 play / 5 players

LIKE: Simple turns and ruleset, and contains interesting engine-building strategy. I like the randomness of the starting chits and they offer plenty of combos to look for.

DISLIKE: The notion of slavery is a negative, but it's thematic and not insulting. Five players might be a little much because the shipping lanes fill quickly. The game is abstract, which may turn some people off.

OVERALL: I liked it, I want to play again. Reminds me of another game, The Golden Ages. There were a few tense moments, but as I fell behind I wasn't sure what to do. Shipping seems important enough to own at minimum two tiles on your board.

RATING: 8
Smart mechanics of taking actions, easy to see the strategies yet complex enough to warrant several plays of discovery. The combination of actions is well done with loads of flourishes such as pulling tokens off the map to gain actions and double-action buildings. Replayability is certain with the randomized set up. Love the theme (even with the risky use of slavery). And wow, it plays very fast even with a full table! No doubt this will get many plays from me for some time to come. Lots to explore in this game.

I gave this an "8" after just one play. I expect this not to change for a while, but I'm afraid, that if I'm ever to play this a lot more, it'll get boring.

UPDATE:
After two plays, the rating dropped to "6" because the game started repeating itself.

The game itself is a mix of various mechanics resulting in a wargame-ish, eurogame-ish, Knizia-ish area control game.

Endeavor is an excellent game. I would describe it as mechanically elegant. It sets up easily, is easy to teach, plays very quickly but involves a great deal of thought and strategy when playing. You play one of several European powers expanding their influence at first in Europe and then abroad. Your goals shift through the game from colonizing to shipping and unlocking new regions to exploit and then colonizing again. You attempt to become regional governor of new territories, to conquer more land, to collect victory points through building trade routes, and collecting specific sets of cards. You are able to customize the sorts of actions your empire takes as the game progresses by building a personal tableu of actions in the form of buildings and using your labor pool to power them. Will you be a militarty empire bent on conquest or a shipping empire based on expansion and colonization? A little of both? Will you build your empire on the backs of slaves or be known as the nation that abolished slavery? The game is just good. Thematically, mechanically, and artistically it is a master piece and it is a shame that it is out of print. Well, except I kind of like having one of the only copies around in my group :p Some people may say that, like in Five Tribes, this game is offensive because it is "about slavery". Not so. This game is about empire building and it does not white wash that slavery was a part of Europe and the worlds history when it came to building these empires. However, it also does not look away from the fact that slavery was eventually abolished. Endeavor introduces an ingenious mechanic that treats slavery sort of like the empire equivalent of steroids. It is good for some quick short term gains but if it is abolished, the empire takes a hit to VP as the world evolves a conscience in regards to the practice. In my opinion, the game includes slavery thematically and mechanically and this does not make it a bad game it makes it an honest one.

No auctions, no money, no victory point track, no really bad moves. Complex setup and counting of victory points at the end.

RATING: 8
Feels like a civilization game that does not take very long at all. There is war, trading, exploration and shows the slave trade in a realistic light (It was profitable at the same time as cruel). The lucrative trade lanes and links are also very thematic as one tries to gain them or pry them away through war or otherwise. There can even be negotiations with the right crowd. 
Downside is the fact that this is a game that scales better with more players to its max and needs minimum 3 to play. 
I really enjoyed the game and is highly recommended.

RATING: 7
Good looking and well-designed game with polished rules.
Everything fits and works. It is well-themed, has a decent amount of interaction and even has direct conflict, which is rare for a euro-game. Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to be as good as the sum of its parts. It took a little too long: almost two hours, but that may have been cause by inexperience of some players. If we can get playing time down to one hour, this game may get much-improved ratings.

A very streamlined worker placement game with tons of visual cues and icons to figure out what's going on. However, it is very thin on theme to the point of abstraction and is very much a token pusher. Another minor downside is that you don't know who has what points until game end, so you're never sure who the leader is to "attack". 

We definitely like Endeavor better than Puerto Rico or Caylus, but we remember liking Cuba better. Still, I can see Endeavor as being a solid game if you want to play a streamlined worker placement game within 90 minutes with 5 players. Our game is missing one red cube.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
It's a good game, and, if you look very, very closely, you just might be able to see the theme. If the theme were more tied in to the mechanics, I might rate it higher. Actually, with more plays, I might rate it higher regardless, but I can't imagine my rating reaching an 8. Some people complain about a game if there's nothing new in it, but that doesn't bother me if the familiar elements are tied together in a challenging new way, or even if the mechanics are simply rethemed. However, Endeavor feels like a number of games that I have played with nothing new about it, and an almost absent theme. If I played this five years ago, I'd be a lot more excited about it, but as it is, I can only say it's a nice game. Oddly enough, given the number of people who have said it's Struggle of Empires lite, I now very much want to try Struggle of Empires! Apart from that description, though, I would not call Endeavor light anything, apart from theme. And the board is quite unattractive.
Endeavour can be cutthroat, if you want it to be, and that doesn't bother me. But it does bother me that the person you're stabbing doesn't get any benefit from it, as you would in games like Carson City, Hansa Teutonica, or even Rheinlander.
A tad on the overhyped side.

3-5(4,5)

2p variant. I like it quite a bit. It's actually quite short (almost too short, only two regions unlocked). I have yet to explore the balance (is colonization / attacking too strong? etc.) but a lot of fun choices and the neutral player does get in the way. A LOT of recordkeeping with the neutral player, though (have to remember to place him). It is exactly the sort of game I enjoy. Dry, in a sense, but also very well put together. Does have the Agricola-like feeling of "the game's over? But I'm just getting started!" in that it's pretty much impossible to advance all your tracks, build a level 5 building, ship, colonize, etc. in a single game.

Takes a while to set up, though. Geez. Kind of sucks that you set up a billion little chits on the board and you only unlock two regions, meaning that like 40% or more of that set up was for naught (well, I guess you make decisions on where to ship and colonize based on the layout). Still.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Wow, great game...reminded me of a number of the Early Euro but distilled with a very smooth play sequence.  Start out slow but then watch out...you start to formulate strategy and see how it goes.  We didn't finish the game due to time contraint but we were at turn 5 already.  I tried a balance approach in development but not sure how that's going to factor out in the end game.  Will have to get a copy to try it with the local group.  Upon review of rule, We didn't the action wrong since we didn't perform the payment action correctly.
On order from Gateplay.  They actually has it in stock.
Received 9/14/09.

We played it correctly on 9/26/09.  I'm glad that it was so easy to understand even a semi-gamer like Greg's son Jack was able to figure it out.  I have to find another group to try since Greg didn't like it.(kind of remind him of Struggle of Empires).  Phil was concentrated on maxing out his score on the tech tree but Greg caught up in Europe/Med via attack to link up his cities plus drawing the Value 5 card to abolish slavery.

Endeavor is a well crafted combination of familiar elements.  Everybody mentions the Puerto Rico-esque buildings and the Goa-style tracks, which allow you to do more the further you progress. It is all quite streamlined and easy to learn. At heart it is about building an engine to maximise your actions.

The element that you don't expect in this sort of pure bred euro is war; though it is in a very simple and abstracted form.  Indeed, despite the exploration and empire building gloss, the whole game feels fairly abstract.

Endeavor is a perfectly well designed game that did little for me.  It presented some opportunities to do clever things and yet failed to excite.

Eurogame que no acaba de emocionar tras varios intentos.

Trata se ser un juego ligero de pseudo civilizaciones pero se me queda en uno más. Tras varias partidas resulta bastante repetitivo.

Alguna de sus mecánicas resulta original en un principio pero por desgracia el tema está muy pegado y se me queda un poco corto en duración y profundidad. 

Casi podría decir que es un juego abstracto.

Los componentes son bonitos, pero lo veo muy superado por otros juegos.

I normally don't like "no luck" games, but I do like this one. You don't have to look too far ahead to do well, the random chit layout makes each game somewhat different, attacking is simple with automatic victory and used sparingly, and your choices are sometimes difficult and always meaningful. The main downside I see is that the higher number cards provide so many VPs, that you almost have to ship to one or two regions and gain a presence of 4 or 5, so you can draw a couple of "4" and/or "5" cards at the end of the game for lots of late VPs. I suspect this tactic will evolve into every player's endgame plan. Also, the game lends itself to AP in the last round.

Seems like the first player gets pretty boned, and there's a lot of times where you are just shut out of doing anything useful.  Not really all that fun, to be honest, but not too too terrible.  Another play (knowing what I'm doing) may raise my ranking.  Maybe.

Surprisingly simple core despite an initial veneer of complexity.  I disagree with those that file this as a tech tree game, since there are only four simple and parallel tracks to push with no unlocking of higher ones.  I think its accessibility promotes replay, but especially the feeling that it seems imminently capable of being optimized.  Fun for now, but I feel like it's going to take "settler-quarry" to a whole new level pretty quickly, and probably along unequal turn order lines.  Initial chit distribution affects a lot.

RATING: 9
Thoughts after three 2-player games (variant in the forums) and one 5-player game.

Games are very tense and competitive.  All the games that I have played of this have had a lot of player interaction and conflict: there has been a lot of competing for governor cards and connections.  Buildings go fast in the 5 player version (not an issue in 2P).  There is just enough attacking to keep you on your toes.  

The high level of DIRECT interaction is HUGE breath of fresh air when compared to so many other low-interaction or indirect interaction euros out today.  In a way, the  interaction in Endeavor is on par with that of older euro games that didn't shy away from direct player-vs-player conflict, games like Settlers, El Grande, and T&E.  This a big plus in my book.

The game is easy to teach, and it is not difficult to fare at least decently on your first play.  Getting good at the game looks like it will take some time, and my initial plays give me a taste of a lot of hidden depth.

I am not surprised that this game is getting such good ratings, there's a lot of re-playability due to the random chit layout and there are going to be a number of strategies dependant on what your opponents choose.

Good game - seems to produce very close results, which is either a testament to the balance, or an indication that nothing really matters!  (I think the former, but I haven't played enough to make sure.)  Only problem is that it tends towards 2 hours, which will limit my table time.

RATING: 7
Mechanically, the two most prominent elements of this game are engine-building and area-control. The engine-building aspect allows you to increase build-level (can draft more powerful buildings), increase growth-level (can get more workers), increase salary-level (can free up used buildings), and increase political-level (can hold more cards, which often increase other levels). The area-control aspect gives players access to different markets (so they can purchase cards) and feels like a race with the cards (limited spots, only can get/buy card if you have x spots occupied). Furthermore, the area-control aspect allows players to attack each other, but it is costly to the attacker and often negligible to the defender. In other words, it is well-controlled and doesn't open itself to meta-gaming, like other area-control games.

While this fits comfortably in the euro-genre stereotype, this is far from a solitaire game. The depth and richness of the game comes out with the synergy between the players. Understanding what your opponents are attempting to do and positioning yourself to benefit is really what the game is about. And despite a very streamlined and medium-weight ruleset, you always seems to have a plethora of options.

Overall, this game strikes a wonderful balance between tactics and strategy, manages to play quick with a high number of players, and has mechanics that facilitate interesting decisions while remaining easy-to-understand. Simply put, this is a very good game. If I had to complain, I would say the game is a bit fiddly to set-up and it really works best with larger groups (4-5 players). Other than that, it is a wonderful game.

I was interested in this game due to its quick play.  Thanks to a fellow BGGer, I have been spared buying the game that I would later sell anyways.  Below is the observation that was the deal breaker for me.

[q="Sorp222"]I have read some where that it is hard to make a really bad decision in the game. I would think that a weakness in the game design but I don’t think that is true in Endeavor. I have noticed that sub optimal play hands a lot of good stuff to the player on your left . My first game the player on my left  won  partly because I played badly. After the early discovery games I think it will be best enjoyed played with gamers of a similar standard.

...

[b]‘Puerto Rico’ factor[/b]

Because the scores are so tight in a game less experienced players can, inadvertently, hand victory to some one else. I have benefited more than I have suffered from this, but it makes me think that it is especially the case with Endeavor that the game will be enjoyed by playing with players of a similar experience.

Initial Impression: If I were to sum this game up in one word, it would be "smooth". The game begins with very short turns but by the end the turns become much more complex. There's potential for a fair amount of direct interaction as well as blocking. The game does not take too long to play. I suspect that this game could be used as a gateway game.

First Play: 5 Player game. 

After rules were explained, strategies weren't apparent immediately (to me at least) and I made a couple of sub optimal moves that doomed me for the rest of the game. A solid  foundation in the central board is essential to get cards which give you a leg up in revving up your production engine. I suffered early loses here and I was never able to gain a slavery card (or indeed any central cards) and as a result brought up the rear for the rest of the game.

I imagine the game will vary considerably dependant upon the number of players with 5 being the most pressured and cut throat. 3 should be quite relaxed.

Starting position may also have a dramatic effect on strategy. Go first in a 5 player game (when there appears to be little or no advantage) and you will be picking up the least advantageous options for the next 4 turns when the game is coming close to a conclusion.

Certainly an opportunity for King making and bash the leader (which I don't mind) and an aggressive game where players can cripple an opponant early on if they are minded to do so.

However I did appreciate the depth and thought required for the game, but beware AP and I think a 3 minute timer is essential in order to keep the game flowing. Our first game with 3 beginners and 2 that had played before lasted 150 minutes.

I look forward to playing again.

Second Play (8 years later): Game was sprung as an option and I had forgotten 95% of it after such a long interval. Whilst giving the impression of multiple paths to victory, this isn't true. All new players must be told that shipping is crucial without it you will go no where. If you stumble in the early game you won't recover. Latter stages are very prone to AP and the last two turns seemed to be excessive exercises  in bean counting as players sought to maximise the efficiency of their turns. 

A dry experience that I see no need to repeat. I have much better games in my collection that need to be played. For sale.

This game is a bit of Age of Empires III and a bit of Puerto Rico. You purchase and activate buildings which help you claim resources and build a presence in different areas of the world. It has a unique mechanic though that forces you to keep your resources somewhat balanced. There are a set number of turns in the game, and the first few go pretty quickly but slow down as the game gets more intense. I've been completely absorbed the few times I've played.

Want to play again. Area control game where euro-centric players lay claim to different parts of the new world to score points in the four areas of industry, culture, finances, poltics, and general imperial awesomeness. You keep track of your progress and capabilities on player boards similar to those used in Goa or kingsburg. The game attempts to deal with the historical contribution of slavery by representing it with a novel mechanic that penalizes overuse. I can appreciate that a game of this subject matter would at least acknowledge it rather than hide it away or pretend it was never a factor by not including it, but I'm not convinced that it adds that much to the game. I do want to play this again soon, so my bgg rating is a 7. I suspect, however, that it will probably settle down to a 6.

Provisional rating based on only one play.  Played reasonably quickly, good fun, plenty of depth at first blush.  I could see this going up or down based on the actual amount of depth in the game.

Edit:  Played one more time, still like it.  Tried forcing a particular strategy to see how strong it was.  I think tactics are more important in this game than strategy -- any strategy can be good enough as long as you stick to one and you don't screw up the tactics along the way.

OK, well it isn't a bad game. Very reminiscent of Puerto Rico, though it has the benefit of being slightly shorter. I have to say though, I can't see what everyone raves about. It seems to be a game of waiting for others to take the less useful stuff so you can grab the goodies and as such turn order is quite important (sit to the left of the newbie seems to be the rule). Whilst it has few absolute faults there is nothing in it that stands out to me, and very little to make me want to play it again above any other game.

I’m no eurogamer but most of my gaming buddies are so I’ve got used to play their games too: the last one I took part in is Endeavor, just another soulless and themeless game that looks and plays like a thousand others.

Endeavor is your usual resource-collecting, point-raising, action-optimizing eurogame where theme is missing or just faintly hinted, a little more than a wrapping for their carefully balanced mechanics: in the end it’s neither a bad nor a boring game, rather it’s quite fast and sparkling (as an eurogame), even though it feels cold, unthematic and quite unsatisfying.

HUGE setup overhead (which I imagine would get tiring quickly), but once you're in it's a medium-complexity game that plays remarkably quickly and offers multiple roads to victory. I really enjoyed setting up a tradign empire instead of just winning thorugh conquest, though I got crowded out of the technology race early on and spent a lot of time catching up. Would definitely play again, would even consider buying it.

RATING: 6.5
An okay game. Feels somewhat scripted because some building tiles seem to be better than others... and it was tough to run with a shield (card limit increasing) strategy because cards are not necessarily easy to obtain from the continents... but it's hard to say after just one play... I probably missed something critical in terms of "combos" to make the strategy work.

** UPDATE ** The trick with this game seems to be obtaining a lot of the "icons" from buildings and/or tokens instead of trying to get them all through acquiring the good cards... because you have a limit on the number of cards you can hold.  Also, you don't need governor cards to win... if you can win one, great... but don't stress too much about winning one.  Governorships are hotly contested (i.e. cost a lot of discs/actions) and usually you can collect a comparable amount of good stuff from the rest of the board while other people are fighting over a particular governorships.

This is definitely high on my list.  Even the fiddly setup and slightly confusing card capacity doesn't hurt it.  I really like the tension created by making moves in the shipping lanes and drawing cards... I like the fact that a player can sneak into a region with minimal investment, yet snag some occupation VP.  I need to remember to warn new players that shipping alone is NOT a winning strategy! It definitely has a different feel with 3, 4, and 5 players.  All are good experiences... just different.

Hmm, mechanically quite clever, and I like tech-trees, so that's a positive.

However it's a euro with a paper thin theme - I really don't get what the 'connection' bonuses are supposed to represent, trading network maybe? There's some attempt to flavour the colonies by the cards for each, but still ...

Don't mind the abstraction, in fact removing the bean counting for money is a big improvement and certainly speeds the game up, and it has a snowball effect, rich get richer, early turns to setup later ones and no 'catchup' mechanic, which I like. But doesn't help the theme though ...

Going later in the turn can be horrible, and depending on the random setup certain places are very obviously better.

Overall, the usual 'optimise your turn' type euro, quite easy to get into once you've played it once. Usual 'ahh' moments when you figure out play strategies, but in the end rather forgetable. Game didn't grab me with a 'must play again now, and this time I'll do X' as doing X is very dependant on game setup, seating order and what others do.

Inclusion of combat is interesting, but I'm not sure it fits, gives an element that you don't usually expect in a euro and I'm not sure it works ... can be quite costly in terms of efficency to start combat, and horrible to suffer an attack as you just lose vps and possible connections and card draw options. Not easy to remove it though, as it would make the combat buildings rather weak. Furthermore with some groups I could see people getting annoyed if you go down the combat route to get more interaction.

While I was playing I just kept thinking, I'd much rather be playing Age of Empires III. So, its a '5' for me - if you have it and want to play it, I'll play, but no desire to own a copy.

There is a bit of a Dominion situation where in that if a person takes the cannon building...you could lose valuble progress...so once someone does indeed choose a cannon------ youre wise to follow up likewise... otherwise focus on nice links and optimising for points.  

The game at 8 turns too short, similar to the way Cuba felt until it had its expansion.

Initial rating after one game.  The game flows beautifully.  I was surprised at how much of the map was unexplored in our four player game.  Seems to have good tactical/strategic balance.
Two more plays.  A little put off by the AP and point counting at the end of this game.  The winner is usually the one least picked on militarily.  Third thoughts - game is seeming more and more rote and mechanical.  I felt very uninvolved my last game.

A lot lighter than I expected.  The dry theme betrays an accessible design with lots of options.

Comprada la edición holandesa en pedido a bélgica en Julio 2012. Al final no me cogió el dinero Marc, y me lo regaló por mi cumple, junto con el brass. 

Juego de gestión de recursos  en los que cada jugador tiene que colonizar, abrir nuevas rutas de comercio, comerciar, etc.  El tablero está plagado de recursos y cada uno de ellos te permite mejorar factores del jugador que le permitiran hacer sus acciones con más efectividad.

El tablero está dividido en zonas. Hay recursos que se obtienen al conectar fortalezas adyacentes.. dentro de cada zona se aplica una mecánica de mayorías. 

En resumen. Es un juego muy completo de gestión de recursos. Si te gusta, por ejemplo, el Hansa, este juego te va a maravillar.

Vendido en Dic 2014 a Meridiano Editorial M6, a través de la bsk (concluimos el tema por gmail), por 28 euros, con gastos de envío a medias. Dió pena deshacerse de él.

Has a very nice flow. I like the way how players' options expand throughout the game. It avoids a lot of AP in the first turns to have only one or at max. 2 actions, especially with new players. 
The development boards are a little reminiscing of Goa. 
Played relatively fast even with 5 players.

This is a clever game, but I haven't fallen in love with it.  Maybe it's just Euro burnout, but it felt so similar to so many other games that I haven't felt the need to explore it in greater depth.  I would like to try it again when I have more energy (if nothing else, to figure out just what's missing from this game for me).

Unusual game.  I'm playing and thinking that I'm in second to last place the whole time; then we count up and I finish second.  Nothing new mechanic-wise; in fact, I think, due to the number of buildings, the paths will become known soon if not already.  A lot of options and interesting choices.  I would probably play again, but I'm not jumping to do so.

Unique, challenging development civilization game. An immediate top rating and purchase from a vendor at BGG.CON was earned upon first play, showing simplicity of play and interesting tactical choices. Beautifully done with theme, mechanics, and rules presentation combining for a perfect gaming experience. Medium depth with medium time of play (1 1/2 hrs) makes for a solid 9 rating, with every turn presenting fun, engaging game play as each player develops his shipping/colonization while trying to race for the points and block other players from scoring. The slavery cards are a clever thematic element, and at the same time offer difficult choices for getting ahead early at a future price. A little Puerto Rico (buildings providing special actions), a little Goa (developing your (4) areas), but a very different game from either of these classics.

Very good production values, with a solid board and clearly a lot of thought went into its design.    The gameplay is relatively fast and there are certainly a few different strategies can be pursued.  

The only problem is that the end is a little weird... it's very anti-climatic and sort of just creeps up on you, leaving players with piles of actions and nothing left to do.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting collection of choices.  Random set-up gives good replayability (although I have nightmares about a chit getting lost.)  The most interesting bit is trying to help yourself without helping the next guy more, and yet it doesn't seem to suffer from the Puerto Rico "left of the newbie" issues. Interesting to teach, due to a couple of things being counterintuitive, but new players pick it up quickly enough, and the systems flow ever-so-smoothly.  And of course, one of the most brilliant cover designs ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game doesn't do anything terrifically new, but it is still relatively compelling regardless. The deterministic combat, limited number of actions and variable start set-ups keep the game fresh and make sure that it does play out differently each time. 

That said, I have to admit that the "slavery" thing makes me a bit uncomfortable... It would certainly impact my decision about who to play the game with.

[b]Endeavor[/b] is a worker placement game.  It has a pretty light theme of shipping in the new world. The player that earns the most points wins the game.

What I like most about the game is that it has a variable board set up.  Chits that represent different resources are placed randomly on the board at the start of each game forcing each player to adjust their strategy.

Endeavor was a gift from my Secret Santa.  This one came onto my radar once I read about the "official" 2 player variant.  The variant seemed clean and easy, and many many were singing its praises, so I put it on my wishlist.  And I must now join the choir, as the 2 player game is quite good.  Playing with more is tighter in the buildings area, but otherwise the change is not huge.  The game itself is pure pasted-on Euro, in the best possible way.  The random setup and the building sequencing seem like they'll keep the game fresh.  It is indeed Goa like (although I prefer Goa by far), but plays quite quickly.  Very easy to pick up and play - this is one solidly designed game in the tradition of good solid Euros.  Besides Brass, this is my favorite 2 player variant - works great!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A tight, tense, confrontational Euro that can be really unforgiving if you make an early mistake. The interconnectedness of the tech track reminds me a little of Goa. Since you only have seven turns, you really have to plan several moves in advance, and some well-laid plans can be easily derailed by other players. Combat is a necessary and critical element of the game; you will lose badly if you do not engage in at least some combat some of the time. The slavery deck is a very interesting, if troubling, addition to the game, although I actually find it less offensive than similar (non-) treatments of the subject in other games (Puerto Rico, Archipelago).

As it is, I don't like how the game plays with three players: some sort of variant needs to be instated that limits the available regions of the board if you are playing with just three. Otherwise, it's a solid, good game.

Not the most thematic of gaming experiences... really, it fails to grasp almost anything of the time period in history it is meant to represent... but it is a finely designed board game with a ton of strategic paths.

In particular, I like this game's combination of area control, civ development/RPG leveling and tactical maneuvering.

Easy to teach and grasp.

HOWEVER, for a more-thematic Euro of this period, please choose Age of Empires III.

RATING: 9
Very smooth development/conquest game with a colonisation theme.  My first game made me think it was all tactics, while my second convinced me there's a fair amount of strategy too - after being taught a lesson by one of the designers.  Your strategy needs to be adaptive and flexible if you want to win, which is another attraction - there is no 'one true path', no 'sure thing'; you really need to live by your wits.  Which is perhaps why I keep losing!

Each play increases my appreciation of  the game and, with it, my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial playing was slightly disappointing. Very derivative, sort of ripping off stuff from Puerto Rico, El Capitan, and Goa. Pretty by-the-numbers. Also very damped - with a lot of constraints, players are not going to end up with widely varying scores. Endgame is also a little disappointing, as players run out of legitimate options before the game ends. It's always so frustrating to see designers who can't follow the simple rule of having their games end before they are over.

This is a game I want to like, and I still might, but I just don't get the sense that there is very much here and I suspect it'll be another disappointing game that ends up on the trade/sale pile prematurely.

On the other hand, there are fun bits - the games it rips off are all good - so it might surprise me, and I'd like to give it another go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty cool game that seems to have a few routes to victory, which is always a plus.  Use your buildings to send your guys out to get stuff, which will improve your ability to get more stuff later, which makes it somewhat of an engine game.  It's up to you to decide what you want your engine to specialize in though.  I also thought the slavery idea used in this game was really cool!  You can use slavery to get ahead early, but there's always a chance that you will be fairly heavily penalized later in the game if slavery gets abolished, which makes it a risk.  Cool stuff!

Great balance, strategy, replayability, components, and overall design elegance.  Thematic elements are a bit abstracted and weak, but it still works.  Hard to think of any way to improve the mechanics.   I always have a good time when I play it.

RATING: 6
Updated 8/29/10.

Endeavor seems like it should be everything I want in a game: a semi-abstract Euro with a sailing/exploration theme, a small tech tree, and an official two-player variant.  For those same reasons, however, it is simply not the sort of thing that would stand out in my collection.  Nor does it stand up well against others in the genre.

I do (sort of) enjoy playing Endeavor when its suggested by others, but I find it too balanced to be worth owning.  It often feels like my decisions are irrelevant, and the game will end up with a close game no matter what I do.  I think much of that comes from two facts.  First, players will need to advance all skill tracks throughout the game.  Consequently, the game feels as though it lacks defined strategies.  No matter how I start, I always end having done a fair amount of everything.  There is no sense of specialization or differentiation between players, in my experience.  Second, all skill tracks advance at the same rate, score points at the same rate, and will be largely full by the end of the game.  At that point, an increase in any skill is as good as an increase in almost any other because they are all just worth one more victory point.  By making these tracks both so fungible and so abstracted, the designers have deprived the game of an interesting narrative arc.  I never feel like I'm crafting a strategy, but rather simply pressing the pre-designated buttons and watching the game run without me.  

This is, of course, is an oversimplification.  Poor play will easily lose you the game, and new players will probably see broader gaps between winning and losing scores.  But when played by experienced gamers, Endeavor seems to lack the strategy space to let the players take ownership of the game.  It is too concerned with accessibility and balance, and the safety net it attempts to provide becomes a straightjacket for heavier gamers.

In short, if I were at someone's house and they pulled out Endeavor, I'd gladly play.  But I won't buy it, and I'm more eager to try something refreshing, even if not as reliable.

The gameplay was actually a 7.5 to me at first, but then I found out that there is a dominant strategy which kind of ruins the enjoyment of the game... Therefore I've traded it away, and even though I would play it on occasion, it's not a game I really need to play often. There is even a big kingmaker aspect which makes the game even worse. It plays rather quickly, though, and has some interesting decisions and had the potential to be an 8 or 8.5, so I'm a bit sad that I don't love it because of the strong strategy.

Okay map and euro gameplay though nothing groundbreaking. I liked the Slavery / Abolition of slavery mechanic.

It's like a little Puerto Rico (Activating Buildings) with a bit of Goa (progressing thru Tracks) with a really tight worker/placement system.  I also really enjoy the fact that the random board setup every game can make for a different one every time - especially how chit placement plays into figuring out the best strategy to complete your puzzle.  Hopefully the game holds up in repeat plays and this may find its way to a 10 for me.

Definitely enjoyable with 5 players... but I'm not sure how it would play with three. There's plenty of options for scoring... maybe too many. I enjoy how the options and complexity opens up as the game turns go on. It's pretty abstract  though. Because this game scratches the same itch as other games I enjoy, I wonder how much a 7 rating is due to other games "beating it to the punch."

I've seen this game compared to Puerto Rico. I like PR better, for a couple of reasons. I love the role seletion process in PR better, and the buildings have a more interesting impact on the game. In Endeavor, buildings for the most part entail "do one more of this action."

Certainly willing to play this again, but not sure if it's unique enough to own. It does seem after one play that it's a solid design.

After 5-10 more plays and trying different strategies each time and finding success I have raised it to a 9.  Upon more plays if I continue to see growth it may go up further.

I am still confused as to what I am doing well versus what I am doing poorly.  Endeavor leaves me questioning at the end of the game what happened differently this game verus the last that caused me to lose instead of winning?

Fairly standard action drafting/synergies perfect information game across the standard handful of resource types.  Strong right/left binding, seems prone to heavily stylised play, strongly rewards modestly exclusive focus on specific actions/actions, mostly fairly obvious decisions with few time/tempo elements.  Likely needs a source of uncertainty to render the decision tree more interesting (cf Puerto Rico's Plantation order?)  Currently the decision tree, while bushy, is readily pruned.

All in all a nice, no-luck, light to medium weight strategy game, suitable also for ambitious casual gamers. Liked the four-player game much better than the three-player game. Looking forward to more plays, which is a good sign.

a nice well designed euro that left me thinking about strategies for future games - a good sign, but feeling completely disconnected from the theme - a bad sign. Hard to get a higher rating when it is too abstract. I would like to play this again.
Second play. A close second with a couple both attacking me. I like it well enough but it is not fun enough. It suffers from the same lacklustre response that killed Puerto Rico for me. I expect this will drop like a rock after many more plays.

RATING: 7.5
Solid game which was quiet enjoyable. I played a relatively high risk strategy in this first game to see how it would pan out, trying to score points from buildings and choosing area on the board that was less attractive (but still scored me points). Alas all 4 other players were military aggressors and the strategy didn't pay off. 

The balanced strategy payed off for the winner, although the scores weren't as far apart as I expected they would be. 

This is the kind of game you need to play through once to fully understand the scoring mechanism and appreciate the impact of each action on the end game situation. The scoring really ramps up in the final turn as the more powerful point scoring cards come out. 

The game also probably needs a central spot to place all your workers (like the ship in Puerto Rico) as we had some situations where players were (most likely) using the wrong workers (which potentially changed the end outcome). 

Solid - would play again.

Hááát. Többet vártam az az igazság. Jól összerakott, kerek egész eurogame, de valami hiányzik belőle. Talán az hogy ketten próbáltuk. Még kap esélyt.
Update: hárman is játszottuk, szintén teljesen rendben volt. De valami miatt nem az én játékom, egyre nehezebben nyűgöz le egy játék (sajnos).

Only one play so far. Seems good. Some people had concerns over replayability. If games with no randomness and static setup have legs (Wabash Canonball, Clippers, etc.), I don't see it being a problem here, with the random setup. I think it's fairly subtle (despite being pretty simple on the surface), and will take a few more plays for rating to settle. Oh, and I played my first game wrong. We played each player takes all their actions, then the next player, etc. Oops.

When Endeavor was first announced for Spiel 2008, I wasn't too thrilled about it. It was touted as a growth/snowball game, and I generally don't like those very much. But when the game was finalised and made its appearance in Europe during Spiel 2009, I had already turned around considerably. The reason: the well-written rulebook which gave me the impression that the game would at least be very clear and accessible, a must if I am to like such a game with growth strategies. With but an hour to spare for the closing of the day, I and four other people were rushed through the game, and I liked it sufficiently to take it home with me.

At the time of writing I've played a few more times, and can report that the feeling of playing a well-crafted game persisted. In fact, I probably like the game even more now that I'm beginning to understand how it 'ticks'. In most snowball games everything is locked up in the main positive feedback loop. You start out with money; money begets cards, personages, and buildings; these give you more money; then other components give you points; the end. But not so in Endeavor, where some of the corresponding items of the above scenario have been more or less taken out of the loop and are just 'given' to the player based on a very simple development setting. In this way, noone can truly be left behind (a very sore point with me in these games), allowing the players to focus on the fun part of the game: applying a strategy and attempting to see it through. The entire process reminds me, oddly enough, of Sylla, where a similar approach to model 'growth' has been taken. It all seems to work quite well and very smoothly, contributing to the game's feel good-factor.

Also helping the appreciation is the game's lavish production with large player mats and bright, clear iconography. My girlfriend likes the game too, although she isn't convinced that the game works at lower player numbers. The board is too big, she then complains. But I think that is precisely the beauty of this game: players use what they need so there is no actual need to open up more areas. In other words, Endeavor appears to scale very well, too. All in all: a more than pleasant surprise.

It was initially difficult to figure out what one's strategy should be in this game, giving me the feeling of performing random actions to no particular end. (This is often the case when learning games, but the feeling for me lasted longer for Endeavor than most other games.) But after a few plays some patterns started to emerge and made the game significantly more enjoyable. The artwork is also outstanding, which counts for something in my book.

Like a magnet I`m pulled unexplainably to games that deal
with colonization. Must be my megalomania or my viking blood acting up on me. Open up shipping lanes, conquer
foreign lands , attack and steal rescources. Hear the lament of my enemies as I proclaim my bragging rights 
after winning. As in "Peurto Rico" various buildings may
be built to further personal strategies and slaves also
play a role. This game shines on my Valhalla gaming
heaven. Four players can finish a game under 90 minutes.
This is just the right time span for an evening session
where we usually play 2 euros and 1 filler.

Solidly fun - the first few plays were all about short-term tactics and playing with interesting buildings, but once you get the basics down, then longer-term strategy starts becoming available. I'm [i]just[/i] beginning to be able to look at the starting board and understand something of the "terrain", as it were; I suspect really advanced players might be able to derive a great deal of insight therefrom (particularly in games where everyone's at that level). This appeals.

Secret Santa 2010. Thanks!

One game played. Awesome. I can not see how this isn't going to become one of my favourite games. 

First time through the cycle of turn phases was slow, but by the 5th-6th turn we were moving through turns quickly and understanding the basic nuances of play and strategy.

Outstanding art, rules and components make this a huge winner.

-------------------

Follow on games. Three, four and five player affairs. 45 minutes (not including set-up). Awesome game. There is so much depth and strategy packed into simple mechanics and fast gameplay. Players can take almost any route to try for a victory and the games so far have been very close and exciting affairs. A must-try for any serious board gamer.

This is going to become (if it hasn't already) one of my favourite non-wargames, hence the 8 rating.

RATING: 5.5
Initial rating of 5.5 after one game, in which I tied for the win.  Interesting ideas which I like, but not a lot of excitement.  I'm not sure about the scoring cards.  You can (but I won't) spend agonizing minutes deciding which card you need to discard, carefully weighing the pros and cons of what you're losing in order to gain somewhere else.  

Besides the scoring cards there are multiple paths to analysis paralysis.  Buildings?  Actions?  Place here to win that chip or there to win this chip?  Or ship there to maybe have a chance to get that card so I can slow the revolutions of the earth down while I worry about what card I want to keep?  If I had a point for every time someone said "Whose turn is it?" I would have a lot of points.  

Would have more replay value if lasted an hour less.  But at least it's not an "engine building" game.

What a gem.

There are so many options, and yet our group can burn through this game in around 45 minutes.  It's a beautiful board that is littered with far too many chits, but the development is fantastic.

I'm not sure if it is due to groupthink, but I have won the last few games by just focusing on the opening territories and not concerning myself with shipping.

I still enjoy the game, but after winning using the same strategy as before, I'm wondering if we've explored the game to its extent and now it is time to move on.  I guess we'll know after a few more plays.

It took me a couple plays to "get" this game, but once I did I love it. It's a little too much in that first game, there are so many things that you CAN do that you don't know what TO do, but once I played the game through once, and then was given a refresher, I realized that it really was a fantastic game.
One thing that I'm still new to at the moment is the thought that a game can be completely free of luck, that a game can be based entirely on the moves made by the players and still work, well, this game clearly makes that work perfectly. No cards, no dice, no random elements at all and it is one of the most intense and fun games I've played at recent boardgame meetups.

I like this game's mechanisms but I really don't care for the area control part of the board, where most of the conflict happens ironically.

I do like the tech tree and action selection part of this game though.

I expected more from this given the hype and rules, but was a bit disappointed. At heart a straight forward "influence in areas" game with some slightly fiddly overlays (buildings/technologies). I couldn't really get into this even though I love "I-in-A" games and the theme suited me too. I think I just found the rules for placing & replacing tiles a bit clunky.
I'd rather play El Grande - a favourite of mine - for a very similar experience in a streamlined package.

Endeavor is that always-pleasing and, fortunately, not all that rare sort of game --- one that packs a lot of decision-making into a short playing time. For best results, it seems that you need to keep the progress on your status tracks, which constitute about 2/3 of your scoring, balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Likes: Combines elements from other games that I enjoy. I enjoy balancing of the 4 areas of influence, which rewards diversity and punishes specialization.

I also enjoy having to use a variety of player actions to maximize chances of winning - shipping, conquering, and attacking.

It's a simple game to teach and learn.

Game has a built in end mechanism, which prevents games from going on for too long.

Dislikes: Board set up is fiddly. Chits litter everything. Seems like it may get boring after a few more plays.

An interesting take on worker placement/Mexican standoff type game.

I totaled 55 points in the single game I played (although we missed the rule of double actions being in the same area... which didn't really lead to much discrepancy for our game) and won.

Interesting game, but fairly easy to figure out. Don't get sidetracked by going for victory points from conquering cities or drawing cards.  Go for getting your markers as high as you can along the resource tracks - that's where the money is, especially the Shields. Selecting the Battle option just isn't worth it, as you forfeit an additional population marker, and really don't gain anything in return.  Definitely worth a couple repeat plays, but I can see it getting really stale very quickly - not a long shelf life.

Endeavor is a combination of several mechanics from some of the best Euro games.  It has elements that are similar to Phoenicia (the game based upon The Scepter of Zavandor (which is based upon OutPost)), Goa, Puerto Rico, and the game ends after 7 rounds just like Princes of Florence.  So while the mechanics will not seem fresh to many people versed in the Euro style game, the combination of these elements work extremely well together.

Phoenicia:
In Phoenicia, you must manage your growth of Income, Workers, Hand size, and Victory Points.  In Endeavor, you must also manage your Construction Ability.  In Phoenicia, you can get upgrades along various knowledge tracks, but they are not laid out in a linear fashion the way they are with Goa.

Goa:
In Goa, your abilities explicitly move along 5 different tracks of knowledge.  Everyone has the same 5 knowledge tracks and a the total Victory Points at the end of the game is strongly determined by how far a player has moved along those tracks.  In Endeavor, you have 4 different tracks of knowledge (although your ability in each track may go down sometimes in exactly the same way as they might in Phoenicia).

Puerto Rico:
In Puerto Rico, you must not only build buildings, but you have to get workers to man the buildings.  This is almost exactly how Endeavor works, except Endeavor uses the removal of a worker from a building in lieu of getting gold (a very abstract representation that might bother some people). 

Board Position:
Unlike these previous games, there is board positioning in Endeavor.  This takes place mostly in the form of area majority conflicts, but also in mini skirmished over a city and it's trade route (a victory point + knowledge).

Overall:
Endeavor is a very well designed game that plays smoothly.  Since all of the information is completely open to everyone, it might get bogged down by people prone to AP (Clearclaw, I'm talking to you).  In fact, the last turn would suck if someone tried to figure out everyone's V.P. before taking their turns.

Only one 3-player game so far but I liked it. Initially seems like it will play too short (only 7 turns) but it builds quickly and the final turns provide some interesting decisions. Probably could be tweaked for 3 - shorter shipping tracks and/or one more turn but I liked the fact that you had a relatively short game but with genuine deep strategy.

The theme is perhaps more 'pasted-on' than it appears when you first start playing but better than most in terms of area-influence games.

Rating after 1 play (5 players).

Enjoyed playing a lot - should be fun to explore various strategies - rating may go up.

Edit: Rating increased to 9 (from 8.5) after 4-player and 3-player games today (09/26/09).

Edit: Rating increased to 9.5 after two more 5 player games - this game is VERY good.

Good game. Appears to end fast, however by the end of the last turn most of what you can do has been done. Need to play this one again. Update: Second game better with scores of a three player game all within 3 points of each other. Appears to be very balanced even though each player was doing different things.

Finally a new game that I really want to play again right away. 

I like how everything fits together in this game, and as far as I can see there are no weird mechanism or gamey tactics you have to take into consideration. It's a plan and react game that plays in just above one hour. The impressive part here is that you still get to feel that you actually achieve something.

Rating might well go up with more plays.

It really mixes a good amount of several games I enjoy...Goa being the most pronounced. The game has zero luck and is relatively simple.  I'm wondering how much replayability this will have over time.  The only thing changing one game from the next is the distribution of the tokens.  They all get put on the board but in different places.  So really the only difference is what do the other players select before your turn...ie, what do you end up with?

Yeah, I'm thinking this one has a low ceiling.  I do like playing, but it isn't one I get overly excited about.  After 5 plays, lowering from 8 to 7.

Players represent a European colonial power, exploring and expanding across the globe.  Players on their turn build a new building (giving stuff or allowing stuff, or both), get some population, free up buildings, then take turns to take actions.  Actions are ship across the globe, settle in a city, draw juicy cards, attack other players, and so on.  It's all about collecting glory, gained via advancing up your four area technology tree, taking cities, and so on.  Very clean game, inspired by many others, but taking the best bits and distilling it into a 30-90 minute game (depending on # of players and if you have thinkers present).  Was expecting a derivative knock-off, but pleasantly surprised.  Excellent game.

RATING: 5
I like the tech-tracks and buildings and board play and random set-up of tokens; the takeover mechanism is annoying, but somewhat expensive, so it didn't bother me too much.  What I really didn't like, though, is the chicken aspect to the shipping tracks and the cards.  Because of the tie-breaker, it's better to play later on the shipping tracks, and it's better to take later cards in a pile, so in both cases you want to wait until someone else goes.  This also means you have to pay attention to how you're setting up the next player at least as much as how you're benefiting from your move.  There's no randomness beyond the setup, so in theory you can evaluate the state of the world and predict what people will do, but at least on a first play I found it really hard to keep up with what everyone else was doing when I was still struggling with my own plans.  I'd like to play it again to see if it gets easier and if the chicken aspect bothers me less.  I also wonder if it would work to allow players to take any card from a stack (if they have enough presence) rather than only the top one; allowing players to place anywhere along the shipping track would be similar, but I'm not sure how to handle ties in that case.

Endeavor has a lot going for it - it is a very playable, Euro take on a luckless management game. It would appeal heavily to the 18XX and Wallace crowd, to be sure! 

For my tastes, though, it's a bit too calculating and contrived, and not exactly heavy in the 'Fun or Evocative' department. But balanced, challenging, intellectually engaging, and so on.

Decent, if fairly thematically bland, euro that takes previously used mechanics and merges them into a successful if not exactly innovative whole.

And hey, at least this game calls a slave a slave rather than trying to sugar coat it ;)

Pretty solid and simple conquest game where players complete shipping lines to open up cities in different zones for capturing.   More influence in certain areas allows the taking of more powerful cards from the region.  Different levels of buildings create the action pools for each player, while there is a worker placement aspect to it also.  Sort of feels like Puerto Rico (the buildings, anyway) if it was a conquest game.   Enjoyable and moves along pretty well.

RATING: N/A
[b][FirstImpressionOn14thDEC2014][/b] Played one three-player game which we agreed was not the best way to play it. With three, there are too many regions to explore so trying to finish the shipping tracks took a lot of work and turns especially in 1/3 of the game. 

I've read the rulebook right before play so I get a rough impression on how the game works. Based on this, it feels very bland where you-get-this and then move-this kind of stuff; in this case, when you claim a token, you then move one space on the track matching the symbol on the token. My one play supported this and my dislike for the game basically just snowballed from then on. It happens too many times that it bores me. I just found it to be too simple for my taste, as well as been there, done that kind of thing. I guess it's worth noting that the game was published in 2009.

I bought the game when it's OOP and because majority of BGG users liked the game, I hunt a copy and found one. I just wish that I read the rulebook first before punching the pieces, so that I could sell at a better price for an unpunched set.

Elsőre 9. De mehet még lefele és felfele is. Jól összerakott játék, és ami külön jó benne -azon kívül, h nem csak 4 személyes-, hogy ügyesen egyensúlyoz a családi játék és a komolyabb játék határán. Egy parti picivel több mint 1 órás, a játék maga gyors, pörgős, de mégis taktikázós, odafigyelős. Elsőre csúnyán utolsó lettem: de ez már a játék 2/3-nál látszott: nem készültem fel kellően az utolsó körre - 6 emberrel a többiek 9-10-ével szembe, semmi lehetőségem nem volt. de ez egyéni hiba.Ettől még élvezetes, jó játék volt, és lehet akár jobb is. Ugyanakkor az elgondolkoztató, h a játékban volt 1 profi is, akinek egy jól kiegyensúlyozott játékban azért nyernie kellett volna, s mégse. Kérdés persze, h a csapat érzett rá ennyire a játékra, vagy ő nem volt a topon, vagy tényleg hiába tapasztalt játékos ebben a játékban az ember, kezdők ellen sem mehet biztosra? Ez utóbbi esetén azért csökkenhet 8-ra is az értékelés. De jelenleg teljesen pozitív a játék, az élmény.
Update: Még mindig nagyon pozitív az összkép. Fontos, h az idő-élmény aránya nagyon jó. Szervezhető, tervezhető, bár nem ártana, ha egyszer már legalább a dobogón végeznék :-)

RATING: 6
Good.  A nice evolution of the typical motif of building up your engine and rolling it into further development.  Gains points by filing off a lot of choke points (e.g. you can always build a building) and having a map to add asymmetries and a sense of place.  As a result the game feels like a Euro but a lot more open; you can actually go FOR things rather than constantly fighting just to be able to not starve, not go broke, etc.

The possibility of attacking is a nice addition as well; it isn't the whole focus but allows for a little direct competition.  One knock is the inability to disrupt shipping -- seeing how important privateers were during the game's setting, it would've been a nice option.

One concern is that the game has been so refined that it will play itself out quickly.  Time will tell.

Amusement point:  Some people, who have no problem with playing a game about dominating native lands and occupying their cities, do not like actual Slavery cards being present.  Apparently they only like games about slavery that don't explicitly mention it.

well made game, with good components and well written rules...

no real sharp edges in the design, all that said it scratches the same itch as many games in the work placement mold and doesn't rise above many of the good ones, but it gets a spot in the rotation. 

rating has dropped from 8ish to 6.5 after repeated plays, due to a lack of diversity in game play and no real difference in the feel of the game between plays... likely will max out in the 5-10 play range.

1st and foremost: I don't know how people can recommend this as a three player game.  Is it that people haven't played games that are good with three and therefore think this is good or perhaps fan of the games just want say 'it works with any number of players!!11'.  Anyway, I tried two games of this, once with three and once with the two player variant which is supposed to work similarly to a 4 or 5 player game.  I'm going to make this short and sweet... here's the good: scales well for 2, 4 and 5 players, it's pretty fast, it's gorgeous, there is no luck in the game, it has variety with initial setup, and it's pretty easy to explain to new players.  Normally something like this should rate high with me but the sad fact of the matter is I find the game dreadfully dull.  I can't even really pinpoint why I find it dull.  There are so many better games to be played than this... at least I should have an easy time trading it.

My rating kept going down after each play till I traded it after a few plays. I simply don't get the attraction here as everything has been distilled and nerf'd to the point of blandness. Very little one can do to differentiate oneself as you're all following the same general path of strategy. Slavery is the most interesting part of the game b/c it allows you to do something different than the rest of the table and actually take a risk on something. I don't get the allure. In any case, I've not missed it since trading and would be hard-pressed to play again if asked. For my money, I much prefer Hansa Teutonica for a somewhat similar game of route claiming; that one's got some teeth to it whereas this one is all gums.

Age of Exploration is one of my favourite themes. I'd say that this game's mechanic is nothing special, but I haven't played it for a long time and I'm eager to have a game!

Updated 2012-11-19: The problem is that the scoring mechanism is actually too balanced to my taste, but I like the game anyway. Suitable for 4 players, and it doesn't take that much time to complete it.

Have now won once. It still feels like a great game, but I wish that it seemed like everyone could be doing well at the same time. As it is, it seems like early decisions have a major impact on the end of the game, so gaps between players can be very wide at the end in how many actions they are getting and in their points finally scored.

Endeavor is certainly an engaging game that obviously has multiple paths to victory, but for reasons that partly elude me it is just not clicking with me, and my rating continues to slowly go down with time.

So far, I have only played with the maximum number of five players.  I think part of what I don't like about Endeavor is the chaos that comes with this number.  It is very difficult to make any long term plans and becomes more an exercise in reacting to the ever changing board and supply of buildings and cards.  There is also a real king-making phenomena where taking certain actions that you want or need can hugely benefit the players following you in that turn.

I will for now continue to play, but this game certainly is not one I would be interested in buying.

I was surprised at how simple Endeavor is. It looks so thinky and complex, but the game play is actually quite easy.

It may be simple, but you have to use advanced thinking to defeat your opponent!

Better than Agricola and Le Havre.  Less fiddly.  Design of personal boards excellent.  Moves right along.  Uncomplicated rules.  Pleasing looks.  Box says 90 mins, but so far, 45 mins is all it takes--and that is with 5.

The board setup in the beginning adds variety to each game.  

The more the merrier with this game--attacking becomes more frequent and it is harder to carry out a plan--as your items get taken, play has to be continually adjusted.  So far, the winner hasn't been determined till the last round because the 5th level buildings and cards are such a boost.

Edit:  Is standing the test of time.  Keeps coming back to the table.

RATING: 7
High-level colonisation Euro that I quite like for its potential to play quickly. It's begun to cool on me, perhaps due to less variety in how games turn out, perhaps because of its kingmaking and leader-bashing capabilities (giving governor to others and attacks).

Duration: Actions are sequential but fairly small; the game can be played fairly quickly with the right people.
Design: Abstracted Industry, Culture, Finance and Politics tracks coupled with free buildings are the cleanest side of the design; buildings and colonists point towards Puerto Rico and are a bit fiddly. Card decks and buildings are always the same; randomness is only where the tokens are placed.
Strategy: There are actually a few ways to approach the game, and the continents give different styles of bonuses.
Components: I like the board and the clean play mats; the cards have little continent-themed icons but that's about it.
Theme: I haven't been into colonial-style games - Puerto Rico is fine mechanically but leaves me cold for theme - but this one caught my eye.

Note there is [i]no[/i] relationship with Cook's HMB Endeavour, and I wish they spelt it the UK way, and kept the Pacific map.

Feels very standard Euro to me, but I love Euros and this one brings a lot to the table.  One thing I don't like is it encourages you to be too balanced because if you go too heavy in one category, it will generally be a waste.  I can already see there's not going to be a huge gamespace to explore.  It's going to be about efficiency and tactics rather than strategy.

A lot of people really seem to like the interaction available in this game, but this is actually what ruins it for me.  Attacks are strong enough given the relatively small point spread from first to last (maybe 10pts) as to make your strategy over the course of the game relatively pointless.  Games can easily be won and lost through negotiation and diplomacy alone.  That's fine, but I think the game should focus more on that and less on the mechanics in that case.  What really annoys me about the diplomacy is that you really have nothing to negotiate with.  It falls into the "gang up on the leader or just generally whine your way to victory" category.  It's a zero sum game.  Besides colluding to hammer on the leader, there is nothing you can offer that is of relatively greater value to someone else.  If you want to see a game do diplomacy right, play Here I Stand.

Fun game to play, but found that having a cannon (via a building card or a token from a space taken on the board) is a big advantage ... especially if your name happens to be John (fellow Arlington, VA gamer at the Games Parlor in Chantilly, VA).  I just played the game again and found that having a cannon *isn't* always an advantage.  You can win without it ... but if you're John, a cannon will definitely help you win.

Ah, the joys of conflict and colonisation in the 18th Century, boiled down to a few counters and cards on a map.  Seems fairly well-balanced; suffers a little because once a player opens with a particular strategy, it is difficult to pursue others and attain success.

Pasted on theme?  Well, the theme certainly came first here, though things have turned rather abstract; it isn't pasted on.

This game was fun. We had plenty of options and the game progressed quickly enough for us. By the time the game ended none of us felt like we had lost terribly and the competition was extremely close, barring understanding of the scoring system we didn't do terribly. I ended up knocking much from peoples scores by abolishing slavery in the last turn.

Good game for new players as the range of actions grwos gradually over the course of the relatively short (~1 hr) game.
Much prefer the 5-player to the 4, as there is a lesser feeling of accomplishment and even interaction with fewer players.

A pure, unapologetic Eurogame: pasted on theme, victory points, resource management, variable actions, colored wooden cubes, no player elimination.  It may be a stereotypical Euro, but it's extremely fun and it plays very quickly.  One of the best Euros out there. However, setup is a bit of a pain, and it takes a few plays for everything to "click".

Jogo bem legal. Cada jogador tem um tabuleiro individual onde deve, a cada rodada, construir uma edificação que lhe permitira realizar uma ação. Neste tabuleiro você tem 4 marcadores, construção, população, dinheiro e política. Essas habilidade são melhoradas pelas novas construções pelas ações que elas permitem serem feitas no tabuleiro. Interessante o jogo. Rápido e fácil de explicar. Só a pontuação que achei meio bizarra. Umas coisas valendo cento e tantos pontos e outras valendo 3 ou 4.

Nagyon tetszik a design, gyönyörűek a lapok, jópofa a tábla. A játékmenet a szabályok elolvasása után egyszerűnek, ám mégis nagyon kombinatívnak tűnt. Ezt az első játék igazolta is. A szabályokat nagyon gyorsan el lehet magyarázni, ám a játékban ennek ellenére sokat kell kombinálgatni, és figyelni az ellenfelek mozdulatait, megfejteni a gondolataikat. Kicsit fura, hogy az első 4-5 kör lemegy 30 perc alatt, és az utolsó 3-4 eltart még 40-60-at, de ez érdekesség inkább, mint hátrány. 3-an egy óra alatt simán le lehet zavarni. Kíváncsi vagyok, több fővel hogyan működik. Biztos, hogy elő fogjuk még venni, akár gémer, akár kezdő társaságban. Egyetlen hátránya talán, hogy kicsit száraz,de valamiért itt én nem is igazán igényeltem a mélyebb tematikát.

A második játék is jól sikerült, bár még mindig nem tudom mi a játék nyitja. Sajnos most is csak 3-an voltunk, pedig érzésem szerint a játék 4-5 fővel lehet a legjobb. Majd legközelebb úgy is kipróbáljuk.

RATING: 6
Although Endeavor is by and large a game about tech-tree development it doesn't have the strategic scale that these games usually come with (and actually need in order for that element to be meaningful). The four tech-trees are really just branches, and perfectly linear at that. They aren't even suited to differentiate strategies because you ultimately need to advance in all of them at roughly similar speed.

Progress on those four tracks is achieved by different means, and this is where most of the game is. It is, as mentioned above, much more about micro-managing your turns than a strategic affair. Since the tech-tree benefits always kick in at fixed points during your turn getting the right upgrade in at the right time might give you the crucial point for the win.

It is a highly polished and streamlined game that is sorely missing a few rough edges.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Compared to more recent games, the theme is not that strong here; but as an abstract game, it works.  The game is streamlined so that almost every decision that is made from the beginning of the game is noticeably impactful on one's own success.  For instance, forcing each player to build one and exactly one building every turn makes the game less thematic and less of a sandbox but one can see the relative performance differences immediately and throughout.

Despite any thematic shortcomings, there is still a sense of growth and exploration, and the art and visual design provide enough cues to give a richer sense of the actions one may take.

Sometimes, the game can become a game of chicken as people try to finish shipping routes.

A slight bit more closed information could add some spice and a non-point salad ending.

We will see how the Age of Sail edition changes things up!

Die beste kürzeste Weltersegelung mit Sklavenverschleppung. MAGISTER NAVIS ist ein großes Kleinod, das die seltene Kunst beherrscht in kürzester Spielzeit eine große Spieltiefe zur Verfügung zu stellen. In nur rasanten sieben Runden, die verfliegen, setzt man Scheiben auf ein braunpastelliges Brett um dort thematisch neuen Kontinente zu erschliessen, Siedlungen zu gründen und über kolonialistische Ausbeutung seine vier Fortschrittsleisten zu fördern. Und mit Kanonen auf wehrlose Gegenspieler wird auch geschossen. Geschwindigkeit, Timing, Verbindungslinien und Vertreibungsaktionen sind dabei auf eine charaktervolle Art eloquent miteinander verknüpft. MAGISTER NAVIS gehört zu jenen selten Kreationen, die gut altern. Womöglich ist diese Nachbetrachtung, die eben ihre Zeit braucht, die wahrhaftige Beurteilungsgröße für ein sehr sehr gutes Spiel. In diesem Sinne ist MAGISTER NAVIS angekommen. Die integrierte Idee, die Abschaffung der Sklaverei als Tool zu implemntieren, das gegen Ende eine Partie zum Kippen bringen kann, ist brillant.

Everything that Puerto Rico/Goa wishes it could be (i.e. fun!).  It may be the best medium weight game of 2009?  The production is excellent and the artwork is functional and attractive.  I love how the number of actions snowball as the game moves to the end.  It seems like it will be impossible to fill up the board in the beginning, but sure enough it does by the end.  I wish the cities on the board were named, but that is a minor gripe.  It is well balanced, thematic, and has options to explore.  Simple to teach as well.  Another Z-Man winner!

A very interesting game with a lot of balance stuff going on that made it hugely intriguing.  A very straightforward Euro in some regards (acquire symbols to push up tracks to acquire other things, etc.) but I can't think of another game that does area control and set collection in quite the same way.  Lots of space for blocking and also supporting other players to benefit you (but not too much).  While only a small part of the game, the inclusion of slavery is intriguing as it gives quick bonuses but big penalties if slavery is later abolished.  In the end I do feel like I'm playing a game of symbols rather than feeling the breeze in my hair as a European explorer, but it all works so well together and I'm a fan of the Euro genre, so this really doesn't bother me.  The 3-player game feels a bit too open, but the 4-player game works quite well. It's unfortunate that the regions don't feel that distinct from one another, but overall this is quite an intriguing game that is wholly interesting when you play. Scores are often very tight!

A very abstract and dry euro-game that pretends (very badly) to have a theme. And on top of that the final scoring is a real pain-in-the-neck. The authors are aware of that and state in the rules that players should help each other in order to make the scoring quicker.

But even with this help it takes an eternity. Or two eternities. And when you wake up, your partners are still counting. And counting. And...zzzzzzzzzz...

I enjoyed our first outing of this new game.  Obviously well immersed in Euro gameplaying the New Zealand designers have creatively taken parts of various games (Goa, Puerto Rico, Industrial Waste) and made something new which is better than the sum of its parts.  Good length, satisfying decision-making, quick turns, random board start position, all good.  Residual concern is about the possibility of one strategy coming to dominate (grow everything evenly) but early days yet.  And like others have mentioned a little more theme would have helped - it would have been easy (I think) to have added a 'start city' for everyone to give a nationality, maybe a different start ability.  Maybe in an expansion, along with pirates...

[13 Nov] 2nd play - 2 different strategies yielded a tie on 55 in 4p game.  Plenty to explore.

A great game that will stay on my shelves for ever. Although abstract at heart it carries off the trick of persuading me that I am opening up shipping lanes and trade routes. Very fast initial turns build gradually into a more complex scenario with many choices and options. The level of conflict is real but not overwhelming. Outstanding.

Another immediate hit once it hit the table. The many ways of acquiring points seem better than, say, Goa, and the adventure theme seems much more than pasted on. There are probably "most efficient" play options, but we tried several among the group and the score was close.

For the first few turns you're thinking, "how is this game going to go anywhere since nothing much seems to be progressing?", and then suddenly everything accelerates and your thoughts turn to "I'm not going to have enough time to do everything I want to do!".

This is one of those games where a player can win by focusing on countermanding the tactics of the player to his right. When a player does this, the game is no fun at all for anyone, well, maybe for the jerk.  If everyone works on their own strategy & tactics the game is allot of fun. In the second scenario there will be player interaction and a bit of take that but, it is not one player gaining advantage by just pummeling the player to his right.

A game that reminds me Goa quite a lot, although it is a different kind of game in every aspect.

Given its fast gameplay pace, its complexity and the options it provides, this game is a very valuable adition to any eurogamer collection. It is very solid and it is going to appear in the game rotation oftenly. The design is beautiful and all in all it is an excellent rotation game for three to five players.

Rating is after only two 2 players games using the official 2 player variant.  
First off I would really like to try this with 4...or at least 3.  The 2 player variant is a great way to learn how to play and get a good feel for the game.  Definitely seems as if it would be better with more players though.  My rating would probably go up a little given the chance.

The bland artwork and over used theme kept my initial interest low.  I was glad that this didn't turn out to be as heavy and long as I had expected it to be. 
After setting up the board, at first glance there looks to be a lot going on.  A few turns in and it all came together nicely. Still a little heavy AP the 1st time through. 
Being only 7 turns long it seems like a mistake early on could really hurt you.
I like how you need to mix the 4 tracks and how they work off of one another.  They seem well balanced too.    

Overall a solid medium to light Euro. Nothing really new here; but very well designed.

Complex: easy to teach, not hard to learn

Length: around one hour and a half
Mechanics: area control, track developing...
Decisions: lot of
Opinion: really lovely game that offers what it promises, a tense game lasting around one hour and a half, with easy rules and really tense gameplay.
The game last 7 rounds with the same phases, build, take workers, pay workers, take actions adjust cards. So far so easy, but you have to look what others are doing, what are you aiming for and adapt yourself while following your strategy.
The developments are really nice, the tell you the level for your buildings, how many workers you will have this turn, how many you will pay from those working last turn and how many cards you can keep at the end of the turn.
Honestly, if the game would last more time, I would not enjoy it so much, but with this length the game is lovely.
Tension on the map (where to sail, where to colonize, who is next starting player, which actions others can do at any moment, which card to pick up....) and easy understanding of the rules.
If I would have to say a flow.... the starting player, it goes clockwise every turn, so the starting player will be so twice per game, while the last player on the last turn will only be once. But I have seen the last player winning games, so not much a flow.
We play with a small home rule, in the set up there cannot be blue tokens on Europe colonies, is a way to avoid the advantage of being first player at the beginning.

RATING: 5
Well-crafted but bland efficiency game of limited, uninteresting options. Try Hansa Teutonica for a better game with similar ideas.

Endeavor is a prime example of my least favorite tendency in Eurogames: games that are so finely balanced that all the interesting peaks and valleys are scraped away.  I'd much rather see a game offer items/actions of varying quality, and then provide a method for players to fight over them: auctions, majority, battle, depletion, manipulating order of play, sacrificing more immediate gains, or whatever.  If you're going to allow players to simply go around the table selecting a thingamabob, then those thingamabobs must be roughly equal in value, which is simply not exciting.  Good games need a little anxiety, and should not be prescribed Zoloft.

I prefer to play this with four or five players.

All the romance, bravery, opportunism, and terror of the age of exploration reduced to an optimization exercise. Nothing is risked, nothing surprises you, nothing is discovered, nothing is lost. At least you can be a little naughty and use slaves (and properly pay penance at game's end, of course).

Played 5+. The rules are easy to learn and remember. Straight after my first game we set up again and played a second time. It is a while since I did that. Enjoyed but I am not seeing any magic that will see it getting played above other games. Its winning trait might be that once played players are likely to not need a rules reminder as it is all rather intuitive.

A build-up-your-system type of game like Goa. Just as the ball gets rolling, the game ends. Played twice with four players, I would like to try it again with five. The luck of the draw affects the game greatly, but only to make it extremely different every time. I don't think luck plays much role in the outcome. Plays pretty quickly as well.

Probably the best "middleweight" empire building and development game. Likely to play more because it requires less time commitment.

I need to play more to see if this merits a ranking of 10, which I'm reserving for only a select few.
Like the system so far, and not just because I won my first three games of it ;-)

Excellent game with some new twists.  I really like development games so this exactly matches my taste.  Very short playing time which is a plus for this type of game.  I also love the dynamics: game starts slow with little options at the beginning anfd then builds more and more momentum to the end.  Recommended!

While the game has the theme of nations expanding their empires across the globe, in reality the game is quite abstract.  The rules attempt to set the atmosphere by spinning tales of advancing one's civilization in the areas of culture, finance, industry and politics, while controlling vital trade routes between worldwide cities.  In reality, however, the flavor is mostly absent, as players are simply placing tokens and collecting cardboard chits, tracking their collection on their player boards.  The buildings players purchase simply enhance this collection process or allow a player to be more aggressive militarily.  Sadly, while the game paints an intriguing thematic picture, in reality the theme is little more than a ghostly presence.  That being said, the game itself is quite engaging and challenging.  There are numerous options and decisions to be made each turn, and a wary eye must be kept on one's opponents.  

All of my games have been tense, challenging and fun.  The game is quite fluid, giving players numerous options and strategies to pursue.  The games biggest drawback for me is its abstract feel, but fortunately the tense game play overcomes the lack of a tight theme.  While I don't think the game will set the gaming world afire, it still offers an engaging time for the contestants vying for the most advanced civilization.

Nothing too wrong with it, but not much fun, either. Quite abstract and unengaging. Lots of little decisions, interactions and bits of randomness that ultimately decide the game. Besides, it does not scale well, requiring 5 players to work properly. It doesn't help that it's one of the ugliest games I have ever played.

Game seems a bit dry. Rules also seem to be a bit confusing. Though with only one play so far, that may straighten itself out a bit down the road. I can see how a 5 player game might be quite a bit more tense and also take care of the problem that we had with the cards which was that we never really got to the bottom of any of the decks (only one really) So for instance abolition of slavery never became an issue at all. Also, the first two (three even) rounds seem pretty short, with little to do. But again,maybe we just played it a bit wrong. Things opened up near the end again. But the game never really "took off" in my mind. 
Even as I give it a 5 rating, I feel this may be a bit harsh. I might revised this at some point once I get another couple of plays in. But I don't think even at that point I would change the ranking by more than one point. In any case, I don't feel a huge itch to try it again so it may be quite a while before I revist the rating.

Edit: With a new play under my belt, i am raising the raating a bit. Stll need to try with more players tho.

I expected much more from this one. It's a solid game, but I don't see any greatness here. In fact, there is a "rich gets richer" problem and if played with 4 for example, one player gets the starting player marker only once. May not be the biggest problem, but still not favorable.

I like games where you can upgrade in different ways, but this one is much worse than "Goa" for example. It just feels abstract and there isn't that much you can do anyway. At the end it's about being lucky to get what you want / need, as the other players usually take away those spots.

This one is interesting. It does have very derivative and simple mechanics. The strategies seem fairly obvious. It's pretty abstract and there is nothing random. There are another dozen attributes I could rattle on to make this sound like most boring game of all time. But I won't because it works like a charm and I just like it! I don't know why, but every round just feels tense in a good way. I like the free building gained every turn and how the small decisions there change the directions where this "tech-tree" guides you to in a big way. Deciding whether to go to war or start exploring new continents is always interesting choice. And the card decks work very well, especially the choice between the risky slavery deck vs. ideologically sound normal Europe deck, which doesn't kickstart your game as well.

Eurogame the way it should be done!

On initial play, I found this game to be fun and easy to learn, but with a fair amount of depth.  Cool that there is no hidden information, and no randomness except for the location of the starting chits, but the order of the players (and initial start player) is important.

There is a lot of balancing to do, such as between having enough people (urn track, and money track) and having buildings that have circles that can be filled by people.  Another thing to manage is getting consecutive colonies, at first, just to get extra chits, and in the end, to get connected networks for extra points.  (Watch out for people who have battle capabilities and lots of people -- they are looking for good colonies to fight for!)

Shipping is important; it might even be worth having 2 shipyards early.  There is a bit of a race, and a bit of playing chicken for shipping -- you want to have the most in a shipping track to get the governorship, and even if you don't, you might want to use the docks to finish the track so that you can get a colony as well.

With 5 players, the game is competitive but fun -- lots of battles for colonies, and cards often get drawn down to the end of the pile.  With 4 players, not all the regions get opened (because not enough shipping actions are taken), so it's important to leverage other players' help when trying to open a region (e.g. to win a governor card or colonize in a region in order to make a connection to a city you control in Europe).

The theme is thin.  There are multiple path to victory but it's an abstract game.
Oh and it's not really derivative of anything.  Sure there are individual boards to track your progress like in Goa, but that's it.

My opinion on the game *engine* has gone up and down.  However, I don't want to play it anymore, because it's completely unthematic.  If I want to play a good game engine-wise, I am going to play Caylus, or Puerto Rico, or a Feld game!  And If I want a game about colonization with euro mechanics, I am going to play Age of Empires 3, which is mechanically sound, but at least the theme isn't so thin.

A game of maximizing and balancing your actions.

Easy to learn, intuitive play, nice components, and clean mechanic which works well with the theme.  Especially like the way labor payments are handled!

Excellent replay value as tokens are redistributed every game.

NOT language specific.  Only the rules are required, and the names on the board and buildings if you really want to.

Played 5-player and 3-player games.  With more players are choices are fewer and it is more difficult to plan between turns, but you still have multiple choices and may still adapt your play.

Can be somewhat difficult to determine who's in the lead, until you've played a few games.

All information is on the table, so game will be slower with AP players...

It's got some nice Puerto Rico and Goa elements, but with more player interaction than either, this one is pretty exciting. The most original bit is the map placement and interaction, I like that a lot. Like Puerto Rico (and unlike Goa), the game is fairly intuitive and quick moving. I followed a belligerent strategy of attacking everyone else's forts-- not something you could pull off in PR! 

My initial impression was a solid 8 and so it remains. However, I am terrible at this game. Gotta get it played a little more so I can at least compete...

What a shame that this gem is out of print. I really ought to find a copy of this.

A bit of Goa (development tracks) and a bit of Puerto Rico (activated buildings via worker placement) with some area control & conflict thrown in. Well-written and easy to grasp rules. A decent game with lots going on and multiple tactical paths, but it ultimately feels highly derivative. I'm sure lots of people will go gaga over the fact that it has a takeover/conflict element, but I can't see this one having much staying power.

This is one hell of a great game. You look at the board and it looks gorgeus, even if this game is more functional than thematic. First I didn't understand the options of the available actions but hopefully it got clear fast. As for the gameplay it is pretty dry and brain burning but with clever gameplay you might win in the end. The only luck factor is at the beginning setup which is a big plus.

Pros / Cons:
-Stellar looking board with really great art.
-Great replayability because with the setup every game needs a slightly different strategy.
-Great interaction between the players and cool opportunities to atack each other.

-Not available at the stores anymore.
-Little bit dry for my tastes.

I was hesitant to play this as it's a 'cult of the new' hype-ridden game.  I was pleasantly surprised though.

Once you get past the unnecessarily-fiddly board and play a round or two to grasp how everything pieces together, there's an interesting system of point gathering and management here.  I think I would really enjoy future plays now that I understand all of the buildings and cards.

My biggest gripe at this point is the awful board layout - that's one of the most random, pieced together, bland board layouts I've ever seen.  I understand the 'style' of it, but I think it makes for terrible readability for newer players.

Based on a first play, this is a terrific mid-weight Euro, and deserving of the top 50 ranking it holds.

A quick, relatively simple, yet strategic game which plays out quickly without a huge learning curve, and one where everyone has a decent chance to get what they need to build and advance on 4 tracks over 7 rounds.

This seems to be an ultra light, ultra clean civ building game, along the lines of Phoenicia or Roll Through the Ages. Play is deceptively simple: 1) build a building based on the number of bricks production, 2) get colonists/workers based on the number of vases (imported goods), 3) get X workers back from buildings based on number of gold sacks, 4) take actions based on number of total workers, 5) check hand size based on number of victory flags.

Like other civ games, buildings give certain privileges and powers, but you can only build eight during the entire game. In fact, the game is only eight turns! This is similar to the tightness of A Castle for All Ages. Getting more workers is key, as this gives you more actions. Workers must man buildings, like in Puerto Rico, to activate them, but you need gold to remove them faster on subsequent turns. Shipping allows placement of workers in six colonial regions outside of Europe, thereby returning goods. More workers means more influence, and the most influence rewards players with a governor card, which gives more goods and VP. Whomever has the most VP, in terms of how much bricks/vases/gold/flags they have accumulated on their respective tracks, plus VP from occupying cities and trade routes, is the winner.

I admire the cleanness, purity, and simplicity of this design. Since I have only played it once, it is not enough to appreciate the nuances of the game mechanics, nor the various strategies that are available. Based on one play though, it seems too simple for my tastes, but I will have to try it several more times to see if there is any meat to this game, as I'm sure there is.

Update (08/17/10): You know what? I don't think I care to play this ever again. The civ feel is way too abstracted for the sake of shortening the game time, so there is no epic feel to it. Downgrading to a '6'.

Update (02/10/13): It's been several years, and I still have no desire to play this highly abstracted civ game. With Clash of Cultures out there, I think I'm done with this one. Downgrading to a '4'.

This is a solid "building" game where your early decisions can have a large impact on how your endgame develops.  The game has a bit more of a tactical feel to it than Puerto Rico.  The buildings are not quite as unique and play focuses on try to gain many small advantages over time.  Endeavor is also a bit on the lighter side for a game of this type, which means it is easy for 5 players to play in 90 minutes, even if they are new.  Overall, I the game involves some good strategic moments.  However, I dislike how the game can easily devolve into stalling because doing something you really would like to see happen will help another player much more than you, and vice-versa.  Additionally, it feels a little bland... picking up little tokens that are randomly sprinkled on the board doesn't give you much of the feel of building an empire.

This game has become more streamlined over its development period.  The final version is a challenging, somewhat opaque 75 minute game, that is a bit fiddly to set up, but leaves you thinking about how you could have done it differently.

I think the incentive to cooperate with other players to explore (open up) a new area for exploitation, and the competition for the best cities coupled with the random distribution of tokens ensures this plays differently each time.

A very abstract colonising game in which 'shipping', settling and conflict all feel equally bland. It reminded me of Agricola more than anything, a worker placement game with a lot of calculation in the ending. It's engaging enough, but there are no real competing strategies, the building track is the least important of the four and you win by creating the most city-to-city links. It's at its best with 4 players, with 3 not all areas open up, with 5 most spots are taken and options narrow considerably.
I've detected a recent trend to what I call 'gaming popcorn', light, fluffy and universally popular games of little real substance. This is the prime example, lets hope the genre doesn't continue.

I was totally stoked to play this with 5. I was already mentally adding it to my next game order and wanted to seal the deal. Man, I'm glad I played it again!

5 player Endeavor just totally became a bloodbath. Now, I don't mind bloodbath games, but there were no checks or balances in our game. I attacked DJ a couple of times in key places and he just used his action to undo what I did. Meanwhile, Matt was totally placing himself in a great place for the win. I kept pointing out alternative locations to attack, but ultimately, DJ made the right decision to keep attacking me, because that would give him the most points.

The 4 player game was much more interesting, because while you could attack people, you could also build up your infrastructure and feel like you're building an empire. In the 5-player game, the whole last turn was comprised of attacking. There was no choice other than attack. All of the shipping was gone and the colonies were all taken, so that leaves taking cards (which you couldn't do, because everyone had already taken the cards that you were eligible for) or attacking. It just felt really chaotic and unexpected based on our 4-player game.

I won't be buying this one now and honestly, I probably wouldn't play this again with 5 players. I'd like to give it a go again with 4, but something tells me, now that we all understand it better, it will end up very similarly to the 5-player game.

The perfect euro game with all you could wish for: individual player boards, engine building, interactivity, multiple paths to victory... . Perfect blend.

Everytime I play this game I find myself admiring the elegance of the system again. Even if the game does not create great narratives (e.g. "I conquered the world." or "I destroyed my opponents with my 100MW laser ray."), I always have to think back to my last play: what buildings to build in what order, which opportunities on the board I missed, how I should have adapted my strategy to my opponents',... .

First played September 23rd, 2009. Taught in 15 minutes, played in about 90 minutes for 3 players. The game has a good strategy/luck mix. Lots of options to sift through. Each player begins with a player map that has one building on it. Victory points are award for advancing your tokens along the 4 tracks (building, round people, returning people, and card limit), capturing location on the main board and gathering other special VPs. There are 7 rounds to the game. You have a start player and it rotates each round. Each round players build a building based on their building ability.  Buildings either allow you to gain resources (move up the track) or take an action(s). Then each player is granted a certain number of people to do actions. People that did actions are also returned from the previous actions based on your track position. Next each player takes one action at a time and rotates until players don't have people or pass. Actions can be: settle, ship, take a card, bump someone off a settlement (extra person required). Each require a certain building to do the action. When you settle or ship you take the resource and upgrade the corresponding track. Same with cards. Each shipment island has six locations that need to be filled before the governor card is taken. This card may replace the final card slot on your personal player board, however you get 3 VPs for not replacing it. Great game that I recommend you try and consider purchase and placement in your rotation of game plays.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit. Endeavor has some engine building, area control, a smidgen of 'take that', it is attractive looking game on the table. I would add a copy to my collection for the right price or trade. I like that the game doesn't take too long and that there is very little downtime between turns. I have only played once with three players. The game does not scale for the number of players and I imagine it being much more interesting with 4 or 5 players. Endeavor does not have a lot of variable setup: the connections between cities is always the same and the stacks of cards that you can get are always in the same sequence every game--yes, the tokens are distributed randomly all over the board each play, but the long run replayablity may be suspect. 8/10

There is so much of a game in this - and it only takes 60-90 minutes! Plus, wonderful components and (yeah, I gotta say this) elegant mechanics. If that was not enough, it's a typical Euro with the element of attacking other players.

One more thing: plays really great with two players (just use the simple variant available here on BGG).

Damn, that's a good game. And I don't say that about much.

Why? Because it plays *so* smooth. I mean, the only hiccups are explaining slavery and actually doing the scoring. The turn actions fly by so fast you'd be amazed.

And the story-line is just super awesome. You get to watch as the board slowly is discovered and unfolds. You watch conflict turn inward to consolidate position.

You also get to try many different paths. I shipped out the ass, ended with two tokens on cities, and still got second. I just love that.


My wife really enjoyed the ease of learning and the smooth gameplay. 5 players with 4 newbies in a super crowded and loud room still finished in 2 hours. That's just awesome.

Ended up getting rid of it.  Why?  Because it always felt samey.  You end up almost capping out all your technologies.  Where's the fun in that?  Hansa Teutonica just did it so much better.  Little less refined, but much more enjoyable.

The game works well from 3 to 5 and is enjoyable for people of varying ages and abilities because each person, regardless of whether they ultimately win, can enjoy the empire they are creating and the means they go about achieving that empire, and in a fairly short amount of time. As well, the structured play allows new players to join in fairly quickly while still providing veteran players with alternative ways to play.

Interesting theme, good components, but something just doesn't gel for me.  The abstract connections between cities which make it difficult to see what's happening at a glance, and it usually is a bad thing to be the next-to-last to go on an expedition, as you leave all control to the last person playing.  Unfortunate, as I wanted to like that game very much.

RATING: 8.5
Endeavor is similar to Puerto Rico in that each play is familiar because of its similarities to the last play of the game, but there are enough differences to make it worth replaying. There is a good bit of interaction with the players, without much of a chance to really screw another player over. Furthermore, a shipping, occupying or box strategy, or a mix of any of the above, are all viable. It is also a good game with anywhere from 3-5, with the strategy adjusting favorably based on the amount of players.

One of the most elegant games I've played, it probably has the best time to depth ratio of all my games.  Advertised as a 3-5 player game, the designer has since developed a 2-player variant, and this shouldn't be overlooked. However, after several plays I can see this really shines as a 4 or 5-player game.

Le jeu est rapide.  Le comptage des points à la fin est un peu botché avec les jetons c'est plus rapide de prendre une feuille de papier.  La qualité des composantes est bonne.

I can see this moving to an eight.  I do see the Goa comparison, but find the randomizing element in the game's setup preferable to the more static strategies in Goa.  

The game's primary asset appears to be the variety of strategies that deserve exploration.  My knocks would be my personal enjoyment level would have increased if the game was less abstract and ground just a touch more in reality.  I don't think that starting with a city and calling player's "Portugal, Spain, England, France etc." would have hurt the design at all.  And it would have enhanced my experience.  I also find the iconography somewhat counterintuitive.  

But viewed only as a game, there is a lot to reccomend in Endeavor.  I look forward to getting to know it better.

UPDATE:  I've moved beyond any nit picks about the implementation of the theme.  This is a quality game with superb pacing.  Its an 8.

RATING: 7.5
Fairly good overall, pacing was good, rounds went fairly fast. Goa + Puerto Rico fairly accurate. 

It seemed there might have been an issue where some turns you had nothing to do, could have been a players or two’s fault possibly, but also we played with 4 and the designer apparently did NOT scale the game, the shipping track should likely have at least had one token removed from it on every spot on the board, this would help tighten it up just a tad. Also, one of the buildings is VERY over powered compared to the rest, and maybe this is an even bigger problem since only 2 (or 3 in 5 player?) people get it. Essentially it gives the person an extra very important action every round, unless the action is not possible. I think this is too powerful compared to the rest and likely needs tweaking (like every second round at most) Likely best with 5, good game overall. 

[u]Update[/u] - Game 2 next day with 5 – the Board filled up WAYYYY faster, so this was a designer error imho to not scale the game, WAY better with 5 due to this factor.  Of course, you can say the game is “different” with 4, and I would say not as good, probably one whole spot like India should be not available AND one thing removed from each shipping track.  Another thing, at least 2 of the players experienced the bottleneck, again, some of it was the players fault but it is obvious that trying to climb the tech tracks at same time is very hard and likely NOT possible for all players, leaving some players potentially randomly boned (due to how the chits come out) and stuck with an inefficient game.  The pacing is really good though, and it really does end in 90 minutes or less, so these things might almost be forgiveable.

Endeavor is a really nice Euro.  Each player represents a colonial power.  Over each of the eight turns you get a free building that provides you with one or more actions.  You also get workers that you can place on the buildings to activate them.  The buildings may also provide symbols that advance you along several tracks that provide more workers or lets you pay them off freeing up both the worker and the building or that allows for better buildings or that increases your hand size of development cards.  Activating a building allows you to perform actions like occupying an empty city (initially just in Europe) or occupying an exploration space on leading to unlocking a new colonial region.  When you perform either of these actions you get a token that advances you along one of the tracks or provides a free action that you can perform later on.  The tokens are face-up so a lot of strategy involves figuring out how you can get the tokens you need the most.  If you take two connected cities you also get a token on the trade-route between them so there is a lot of maneuvering.  Once all the spaces leading to a colonial region have been occupied, the region is unlocked.  The player that played the most workers on the exploration spaces gets a valuable governor card for that colonial region that provides a number of advancements on the tracks.  The more workers you have placed in a region, the better the development card you can draw from it (which further advances you along your tracks) as another type of action.  So anyway, there is a lot of maneuvering that makes for a tense interesting game as you slowly building up both your personal position (on your tracks) and on the board.  You get most of your points from your position on your tracks and from the cities and trade-routes on the board.  There is lots of strategy and tactical maneuvering and different paths to victory (driven by the buildings you select).  I also like that it only takes a couple hours and with a clear game clock.  Very fun!

Wow, it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a new game this much! Endeavor might not be terribly original or innovative game, but it certainly is an excellent piece of craftsmanship. All mechanics just work really well. Balance seems good, and the theme is even stronger than the abstractions used would seem to imply.

After a couple of games, I am very impressed and look forward to playing again.

Update: The game feels quite different depending on the number of players. The five-player game is tight; there is not enough space for everybody to just do their own thing, buildings get sold out, etc. At the other end of the spectrum, the three-player game feels much more loose and friendly.

I suspect the 'meanness' of the game will only increase with increased player experience, as players discover how to look at more than just optimizing their own progress.

The highlights of Endeavor were the tech tracks and building powers.  It's been commented that the techs are reminiscent of Goa; the difference is that each tech is utilized each turn, and only once.

There is a mild area-control element in the cards and sea spaces, and some spatial mechanics in the connections.

There will be some maneuvering around slavery in most games, I suspect, with players either bring pro-slavery or pushing the card track ending in the abolition of slavery.  In games with more than three players I'd be surprised if slavery is abolished thanks to the crowding in Europe.  I wonder if some scaling with number of players is necessary with respect to available space and card requirements.  Slavery seems not powerful enough in 3p and probably too powerful in 5p.

***FIRST PLAY, FIRST BLUSH, TAKE WITH SALT***

This may be the best new Euro I've played all year and it restored my faith a bit. I'd been finding the old games to be better than most of the new (I'm working through the ones I loved from back in "the old days": Puerto Rico, Goa, San Juan, etc.); this one though really hit a number of good spots. 

I thought of Goa and El Capitan heavily...throw in a dash of Puerto Rico and you're there. I really enjoyed this play of it. I like the look of it, the options, the balance...and I came in dead last!

May it hold up for years. Really well done and balanced in this first blush play.

This game had an excellent first imperssion for me.  Short and sweet!  I'll comment more on this game a bit later but it looks like there might be a potential for the ideal path to victory...only played twice though with 3 players so I want to give it a few more games to see if there's any merit behind that. 

**Yeah I'm a pretty big fan of this game.  The problem is that other's just don't care for it as much.  It does take a little while to set up...this is overblown by others who again will play it but would prefer to play Stone Age or Acquire.  

In terms of ideal path to victory...well I'd say no but maybe some moves are a bit scripted at times.  In terms of victory point count I'd say roughly...and I'll stress roughly 50 percent of your victory points are derived from tokens which are randomly layed out on the board.  There's numerous factors which come into play in terms of who ends up picking what token so you can't argue to much about the game being terribly scripted.  I guess the point I'm trying to make is that the game has enough randomness, strategy, replayability, and visual appeal to make it one of the top ten games for me.

People like to talk about "elegant" game designs, and Endeavor is certainly one.

This is a "standing on the shoulders of giants" game - it takes ideas and mechanics that were used in previous games and blends them seamlessly into a wonderful product.  It blends worker placement and area control in a game with well written rules and attractive components.  It will be a crime if this doesn't take SDJ.

Pretty unremarkable, standard Euro fare with some hints of Goa. It's got exploration, increasingly powerful buildings like Puerto Rico, a very mild form of "attacking", and four resource tracks that you need to build up more or less evenly.

The game is like Puerto Rico in that you collect buildings which govern your available actions, but that's where the resemblance stops. The game is much more like Goa, in which you advance along numerous tracks to increase the power of your actions. Endeavor introduces a few twists, some of which I like and some I'm pretty ambivalent about. I do like the idea of population and how it governs the number of actions you take each turn. I like that these actions can be saved from turn to turn and that they might block the usage of buildings if they don't get paid enough.

The geographic aspect of the board I'm not crazy about. I think it plays well, but it takes a long time to set up and I wonder how much different arrangements of tiles really affects the game. The game hints at being strategic, but I really think this is more of a tactical game. I think players have adequate control over the their actions so the medium weight doesn't bother me. I think what probably bothers me most is that I'd rather be playing Goa or Peurto Rico. The decisions in Endeavor just don't seem as sweetly difficult as those other games. Still this is solid and I know it will be enjoyed when I bring it out.

RATING: 5
Tentative rating after about 10 plays thus far.  Played the game alot for the first month or so, now have moved on to other recent games.  It's a good, solid game, but not a great game, which IMHO, means it's slightly overrated here on BGG.  Despite the fact that the 95 tokens are randomly distributed for each game, the same number of tokens are available each game, and I think replayability is an issue.  Also, the theme is pasted on.  For me, it's nowhere near as good as Automobile, which is easily the best new game of 2009.

September 2010 Update:  Re-rated the game and dropped it to a 5.  It no longer has any appeal to me, think its rapid initial rise in the BGG rankings may not be justified.  I simply don't play it all that much any more, as other newer games are more interesting.

Very slick and solid and FAST building and resource-gathering game.  Quite elegant, even with all of the chits.

I have no great complaints with the game - other than its prone to AP and hence can have significant downtime - its just not that exciting but I will happily play it.

Endeavor is nothing if not familiar. The theme and mechanics are largely cobbled together from Puerto Rico and Goa. Playtime is reduced. Gameplay is lighter but with a larger array of elements. In other words, it's derivative as hell but well done, so I can't knock it too much even if I'm not exactly blown away.

On the one hand, you've got the ever-present building paths that vary each player's abilities. They're simple, but still provide real choices. You've also got four capacities or techs to manage, and I don't even remember their names. Industry might have been in there somewhere. Maybe culture. The fact is, you could banish all real-world referents and learn this game just as easily. You've got four colored lines and you must increase your capacity on each one. Each one is a bottleneck that can be temporarily eased by advancing the others. Tech trees only work for me if each step does something unique, as opposed to easing progress somewhere else on the tree. The saving grace here is that you may fluidly adjust each level in a few different ways at different times in the turn. The opportunities for timing and sequencing are more refined than they are in many similar games.

On the board, there are various regions to colonize, but it's not a serviceable map in any way, just boxes labeled "Far East" or "Africa" with wavy lines connecting everything. A recent session report noted that, in retrospect, the players could clearly recall what part of the board they were invested in and why, but drew blanks regarding regions and cities. I'm not surprised. I contend that a themeless version of Endeavor would play just as easily, and before I'm taken to task for saying so, consider that that's actually a remarkable achievement for a game of this complexity. Undeniably, the moving parts here are well-oiled and easy to follow.

Endeavor is kind of a sad game from my point of view. The cards illustrate this better than any other aspect. You maneuver to pick up cards, and each one just has a handful of printed values to adjust your four colored lines or maybe your score. It's tough for me to get excited by replacing a card that has 1 green and 2 blue with one that has three yellow and three green. I will undoubtedly play this two or three more times, maybe more. A solid game, but too much was lost in the streamlining.

Update: Six months later, and I haven't tried it again. No desire to, really. There's nothing about the structure of this game that inspires any enthusiasm in me. It's a stripped down blend of games with solid mechanics and very little room for creative play. Nominal thematic integration.

RATING: 9
This game just works so well.  It has many familiar tasty Euro mechanics: building up special powers, majority battles, synergistic placement... Although individually familiar, and having lots of mechanics from more complex games, the game is easy to learn and plays briskly.  No decision is a brain burner, but every one is interesting and consequential.

I've played this game many more times now and I still enjoy it a lot. With experience this game can be played very quickly, easily under an hour with 3 or 4 players. As a meaty filler game Endeavour is incredible. The 3 player game is especially awesome in this regard. The density of interesting and tough decisions is very high. And with 3 players the risk of abolishing slavery is very real.


--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

After two plays one with 3 and one with 4.

This is a pretty good game. The rules are simple and there are a few cute mechanics. The most novel of which is having to pay your workers to free up buildings for future actions. You have to balance the number actions you have with the number of workers you get to perform the actions and the ability to free up those actions for the next round. 

There seems to be some variety in strategy, attacking/shipping/occupying. They are all somehow related; one must ship to open regions and the presence gained helps in getting cards. One must ship to be present so that they can occupy and all of this helps with cards. Attacking helps make connections increases your score for occupying and gives you more presence to get cards. So it would seem that the only constant is cards. But there exist very different types of card, ones that help with boosting your tracks and ones that mostly (or entirely) give VP. Deciding which of these cards will work for you and which building to take each round are some of the most critical decisions in the game.

I'm not yet sure if the replayability will be very high, it might get tiered and boring relatively fast, but it might become a lot more interesting as the subtle strategies reveal themselves...

A slickly developed Euro, but is that a compliment or an insult?

To the good: the game is quite intuitive and flows smoothly, there are different paths you can pursue, and it's well balanced.

But: I'm not convinced the different paths are genuinely different, it may well be over-balanced.

To the bad: a feeling of lack of novelty, player interaction is mainly incidental rather than intentional, most decisions are very obvious.

A separate note to the good: Josh Cappel is an outstanding graphic designer, neatly balancing form and function.

Don't let the drab cover fool you, this is one delicious game. It's almost a civ building game but is much more streamlined then all of the other ones. At it's heart it's really an area majority game with an intense tech tree. I am having a bit of trouble pinpointing why it is that I like it so much but I keep coming back to is that it's unlike any other game. It's an innovation and a marvel of game design and I don't believe I will ever tire of it. You simply must give it a try.

Why did they add the cannons? This element divides players. Conflict averse Euro gamers will take offence at the unrestricted direct player targetting. Fans of American game design will rejoice. Being a game of close scores while at the same time scores can be calculated only with high effort, Endeavor is prone to kingmaking based on imperfect information or simple gut feeling. Such a pity as otherwise it's a game of interesting tactical decisions with a relevant topographical component, something getting rare in contemporary Euros. Although it features "tech trees" which have to be advanced it's not a strategic game as you need any of these trees and usually take the one that is of more immediate short-term use.

There was almost nothing not to like about this game (set-up time, maybe?).  I suspect its one of those games that takes a bunch of plays to master, and the "where to explore", "peace or war", "what cards to take", "do I take slaves?" issues all make for what I think is a fascinating game.

It doesn't seem to me that I should be giving this game a rating of 4, but after 2 plays (both of which left me dazed and confused and unable to figure out what to do to improve my situation) I have pretty much decided that for me this game stinks, and there are many other games I'd rather play.

Edit: Raised to a five.  Take it or leave it.

RATING: 6
My opinion of Endeavor has been on a steady downward slide from
the first play on. After the first play I was eager for a rematch. It
played out pretty much exactly the same way as the original, and so
has every other game of it I've played. Even when people make what look
like bold opening gambits, by the late game the positions are just
the same kind of mush they were every other time.

Everything is awfully well balanced, to the point where it feels as if
what you do doesn't matter. Except when somebody really screws up, the
scores tend to be very tight. Every kind of action is about as
valuable, every player's position in the end of the game is going to
be very similar. Rather than winning due to superior strategic
planning, you win by getting beat up on less by the other players.

Basically Endeavor feels like a game where every sharp edge was filed
off during development, leaving behind a competent but bland experience.

RATING: 7
Nice graphic design makes up for a lackluster theme.  The mechanics for the most part do seem somewhat recycled, but altogether they mesh pretty well and once you start playing it feels pretty intuitive.  The rules take longer to explain than one would think, but once you have them down I like the relatively short play time.

RATING: 7
On playing this game a few times it's gone down just a slight notch.  It's still a good game, but not the 8 I was first considering.  I just wonder at the range of possible plays.   Even if you play fairly randomly, you'll get a decent number of points.  It's just feels a bit mechanical at times.  (Hard to describe, but essentially I'm not sure there is as much choice as there seems in the game).

One of the best games of 2009. Players have their own economy to manage while attempting to advance the colonization of various continents.

Its very similar to Goa but easier to learn and much quicker to play. The balance between tracks is great and players can pursue different strategies to victory. Components are good, but the box without insert is pretty crappy. Also, I have a bit of problem with endgame scoring because it is pretty fiddly (like Goa).

RATING: 5
Not my style of game - too abstract in its layout, too many "free-floating" rules that don't seem all that connected. Did I mention the rules seemed confusing? Played the game for an hour and a half and I still didn't really understand it all that well at the end. There's a map, and ships, but I don't see the point of the board, since there's no real travelling involved and the exploration element feels rather light.

I'll freely admit, though, that this doesn't appear to be my style of game... But then again, loved Agricola, and these two games don't appear entirely dissimilar... 

In all fairness, likely deserves another shot before I slam it.

In my books this is clearly better than Goa and I'm interested in trying this again. After one play with 5 players I'm, however, already ready to acknowledge that this will never be a hit in my household as it reminds too much of Goa in multiple ways. I just don't like the track tinkering and also am not so fond of hoarding extra actions. The end game can also be quite confusing and AP-prone as it's quite hard to read the game.

I like the game's structure, the icon-based system of making you better at some parts of the game, while all seeming balanced. I like the races for different stuff, and how at worst, you get a token for each action you take. I like the cards getting better over time, and discarding on top of these piles to block others. I like the simple but deep system, and how every mechanism can be thematically explained.

Got it because I liked the box art (even if White Goblin put their logo in the most despicable place possible!) and heard about its good reputation.
Gave it a play and... loved it. Really, Endeavor is a great game. It's so good I'll probably never need another game like it.
It's not easy, I shot myself in the foot lots while playing the game... like having too much culture at first so my population boomed which led to me shifting to a warlike strategy, which led to me almost having insufficient population right at the end, which meant... it's just so tight! Really awesome.

Also, best integration of slavery in a board game I've seen so far.

Only downside is that the game doesn't really put anything in the rules to scale for less players. Personally I just put some unused player's markers on the tracks to remedy this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I tried to win this with brute force, just attacking the crap out of my opponents. Didn't work. The inefficiencies of using military force to take over territories rather than just rushing to exploit all the connections and occupying strategically useful territories when there's no one in them yet... well, I placed last of 5. (I also made an idiotic move on my last turn by going for the 3-veep building instead of the double-crate building that would've allowed me to advance 7 spaces, worth around 9 veeps, on the Culture track.)

It's fun, not too difficult, and engaging. Good stuff. Rating might go up if I get the chance to play it a few more times.

[10/27/09: Yup, raising rating. It's a fantastic game. I've never won but have come close. Although, I recently played a game where one player decided the spaces I was occupying were prettier than anyone else's, and after he made repeated use of barracks, there was absolutely no way for me to recover. That player did not win, by the way, so it wasn't really the best strategy for him, either, but it wasn't goofy enough for me to lodge a sportsmanship complaint.

More games with finite resources and direct competition should take a page from Nexus Ops and give you something when another player starts hammering away at you and stealing your turf. It's plenty easy for someone to just decide you don't belong in this game, and hamstring you.]

One of best games of 2009 at least for me. It is not as much thematic as I would hope but otherwise it is briliant. Lot of choices, fast gameplay (if you are not playing with AP player), lot of ways to victory (at least in our games no one yet claimed some ultimate strategy).

(1 play) I very much enjoyed this. Fast play, even for new players. Your empire builds turn upon turn, making the last few turns a culmination of your earlier decisions with the most choices available. This gives the "I can't believe it's over already" feeling that I love in board games.

It's depressing that we never returned to this game, the setup is daunting enough that I don't always bring it with me and the length intimidates those who haven't played it yet.

11/25/17 I raised my rating from 8 to 9. It has been 4 years since we played Endeavor and my taste in games has become more discriminating. 
It is not complicated, certainly less so than Age of Empires III, which I also enjoy. The game progresses smoothly and ramps up steadily. And it is not overly long, so if one strategy doesn't work well you can play again soon with a different approach. 
I look forward to many more plays in the near future.
12/6/17 I increased my rating to a 10 after finding the two player variant.

I can't help but say--HOW is this game considered by so many as "close to perfection"?? Horrendous. How dry can this get? Games unfolded similarly each time, as in, the strategy doesn't vary game to game, or only very slightly. It indeed borrows the essence of very many other games, but this big mix has dulled everything into some muddy grey.

I played this a whole bunch when it was first released and was quite fond of it but it's worn off now and the game now appears rather dull and dry.  I'd still play it but it isn't a game I'm going to champion any longer thus no need to own it.  Primarily I cannot shake the feeling that there are just too many better overall and/or better themed area control games out there nowadays.

People tend to either be lovers or haters of this game, and I'm definitely in the lover camp.  It's way abstracted, but I still think that it manages to capture the theme of colonial power positioning very well.  There are several different paths to victory (one of my favorite things in a game), and lots of room to experiment with the system.  And it handles player conflict and competition very well.  Overall, I think that it's one of my favorite middle-weight, heavily-strategic games right now.

A very streamlined exploration game with a very elegant design. Although the implementation is very abstract, simple rules and quick playtime help pack a good amount of game into a tight space.

The game can be victim to groupthink but has a good dose of player interaction and tech tree building that all blend together well across different player counts.

As far as "no random elements, no hidden information" -games go I guess Endeavor is ok, but unfortunately I prefer games to have both luck and hidden information. 

Since there is no randomness and each players score can be calculated with a bit of effort, Endeavor's last turns have *massive* downtime with serious players, since they can calculate each move and its effects on final scores.

For some reason Endeavor seems to be often compared to Struggle of Empires. Don't be fooled by this, they have similar theme but the games themselves have nothing in common.

The friend of mine send this from the Switzerland SO it was a freebie for me. Almost a great game, but just almost. First af all I have to admit that i like this game, because it's a fun build-your-engine game which is VERY easy to learn and VERY fast to play. There is some - actually enough - interaction as well, so... so far so good. BUT couple of negative things: 
1) FULL INFORMATION GAME; oh, why there aren't any hidden information included, a bit of surprise is always a good thing! 
2) HARD TO SEE THE VP-SITUATION, although you can always count it (because no hidden information) - one overall VP-track might solve this problem.
Endeavor isn't unique game, but it's good enough - so it'll stay in my game collection.

5b. I had high hopes for this games that i had bought at the time when Ystari seemed to pop out only great hits.  However I played this game recentlyt only to realise that it is such a deception:  Theme is totally absent, just like in Knizia games.  

In fact the game is a purely abstract game.  But that could still make to a high mark for me if the game design was not suffering from a Monopoly syndrome:  once a player gets ahead it is difficcult to stop him/her unless there is a little kingmaking from other players.

There is really something of both Hansa Teutonica (tracks dictating capabilities, map that you occupy) and El Capitán (islands to colonize, series and majority importance) here with a little Puerto Rico thrown in (buildings & workers).  Plays very quickly (always < 1h even with 4) which is very nice.  

Play itself has good depth but the breath of options & approaches can be overwhelming at first.  To this day, I still think the 1st turn of a given game is one of the most consequential and complex one.  There's also quite a learning curve to things.  Expect someone who already played to pretty much systematically beat someone who hasn't.  Once you get the hang of things though, it gets pretty fun & engaging.

For regular play, even with people who are not too hardcore, this is a pretty solid option.

Not bad actually. Still I think the game fall a bit short in time. In our 5 player game, we should at least have another turn because there was 1 row of buildings which was never used and 1 continent did not had the chance to be colonized.

One of the problem I might see is that you have to plan a lot in advance to make sure you don't get stuck with unused people and buildings. I would have liked to have some compensation actions to use people you could not manage to use.

The random placement of tokens at the beginning of the game is excellent. Considering that there is no modular map at least you can have a bit of replay value.

The only other suggestion I could make would be that some buildings are pretty weak. The market never get's used and the Bank and theater does not give enough resources for an non-action building. Maybe 3 resources would have been better (instead of 2). But that is just balancing details.

This game is extremely tactical in nature and seems at times to force you to make what may be a sub-optimal move to prevent an opponent from making an even better move.  One mistake can give the person to your left the victory.  I like the variability of options which are formed from the buildings you choose and the resources you build up Goa-like.  I enjoy this game when it is played quickly and approached as a strategic filler.  If it takes much over 45-60 minutes, this game is taking too long and I get bored.

A better than usual Eurogame in my view.  It does offer some strategic decisions that are meaningful and have effect on one's later game development.  The game is of eurocentric view of the world where dominating Europe would almost guarantee a winning of the game.  How to factor in other side journeys over the world to one's overall plan of conquest in Europe is definitely required.  It seems to me it could achive its own objective of delivering a short but concise history of the Colonial period but then you might also find there could not be sligtest mistake made during the course of a game.  Eventually, it seems that there are many choices out there but in fact you could only coose a few of them.  Focus and stick to what you really want to do with your nation are central to your gameplay in a highly competitive environment.  The randomnization of the initial resources over the world might add replayability to the game - only if so you don't care if they are histroically rich in that particular region of the world or not.  Overall, a more "historical" Eurogame for anyone who wants to have a break from the more complicated wargame e.g. Pax Britannia or Viceroys.  After all, I won the game the first time I played it, even without reading the game rules.  So could anyone.

At first this appears to be every other Eurogame out there: colonizing, shipping, little tokens, and so forth. Cracking it open and seeing the usual beige-on-tan color palette, I wasn’t expecting a lot. But it’s actually an interaction-rich, nicely thematic game that’s been stripped down to its essence, and plays surprisingly fast…almost too fast. This is the game you always suspect is lying underneath levels of auctions, cube transformations, action points, worker placement, and other junk. Endeavor pulls all that away and gets at the heart of the game, and it’s a fun, interesting game.

RATING: 5
Bland, fiddly and way too long to setup for what it is. Endeavor's mechanics work, for sure, but it's the type of game you feel like you've played a thousand times before. It becomes a drag if players don't try to anticipate their moves. The best thing about this game was the slave/liberation cards mechanics. In the same genre, there are some much better games out there. Try Goa instead!

At first I thought it was too short but after a few plays I found it gave a great hour of light euro gaming. There is a fantastic 2-player variant so I can squeeze in a quick game with the wife often. I think it's a great light game to kick-off a gaming session. Biggest complaint is that you need 95 tokens and they give you 95 tokens. I just know I'm going to lose one...

[update]Been over 6 months now, haven't lost a token! I've upgraded my opinion that this games is light euro to medium euro. Games have become difficult and deadly competitive. I look forward to exploring this game some more.

Improves on the Goa formula in almost every way. It has perfect information, player interaction, and a shorter play time. It steals Goa's 9 and Goa reduces to an 8.

Update:

Thought play has fallen off after 20+ games it's not something I would ever turn down. We've since gone back and played Goa and Industrial waste and this one seems to do things faster/lighter/better. You accomplish so much so fast. It would likely have gone up to a 9 or 10 if Hansa Teutonica had never come out.

Interesting game.  If you have played Goa, you will recognize some of the mechanics, but it is still a very different game from Goa.  I don't recommend this for 3 players, as not enough of the areas open up (and slavery becomes less of an option), leading to a very cramped game.

The game focuses on Europe colonizing various parts of the world.  It is very abstract with a rough European map but no focus on countries or civilizations.  You build an economy by acquiring cards that provide you with resources.   You place tokens on the map to gain additional resources and benefits.  In some ways you have to work together to open up new areas to settle.  

Some players may be put off by the abstract nature of the game, but if you like majority control type games, this is very good one.

11/2011 A very good effort at a resource management game.  There's lots of these kind of games, some hits the table again and again but most won't.  The theme feels somewhat pasted onto the mechanics as it often does; the athmosphere doesn't become very nautical during the game.

First play was a lot of fun and quite interesting. There is a high level of interaction between players, and seems like several approaches you could try. I had a slow opening focusing on buildings and resources while others grabbed space in Europe. That felt slow but I ended up a close second to Matt who balanced Europe and exploration nicely.

Rated after 3 games:

This plays very smooth and fast, and feels really elegant.

After many more games:

I like it even better. It is among the most elegant and well-designed euros of all. With very simple tools, this game goes a long way. 
It has a great dramatic curve, short and unchanging downtime throughout the game and it looks & feels great.

Downside is that it's full-information, so analysis paralysis is a risk. But overall playing time is still way shorter than most euros.

Lowered to 7 because the last couple of games has felt a bit stagnant.

RATING: 6
[Played 4 times]

Resource collection and some drafting (buildings, cards). Minor direct interaction via wars (that can occasionally be annoying and lead to kingmaking), but mostly it is area majority.

Very fast first turns (when you have just an action or two), while later ones can be quite longer (and with more options, since areas of the boards get "unlocked" during the game). Overall, the length feels right and the decisions not trivial.

Deterministic gameplay, but random setup to offer greater replay value.

Theme is inexistent.

Nice game in its genre (optimization of actions, building an economic engine, scoring VPs to win), albeit it lacks a "soul" (i.e. some good reason to play it rather than the other hundreds of similar - and in some cases better - games).

Very original game of which I know no equivalent. Thematically interesting. Plays pretty fast, even with 5 players, although a lot of difficult decisions have to be made. But your options are visually very clear.

One negative side is the importance of the actions of the player that is sitting just before you. If this is an unexperienced player, you have a considerable advantage.
Otherwise, a game that can be played by everyone. Easy to learn, easy to play, and all you do is always good for something, so running away in score is something I didn't see happening yet.

RATING: 5
It's clever and fast, has a good dynamic arc and looks great, but my first game left me with the impression that a lot of offense moves against me took me out of the loop. Sadly, our second game confirmed that early attacks are moderately helpful to the attacker and can be absolutely deadly for the (more or less arbitrarily chosen) victim. Having it happen to someone else this time did not make it substantially better.

This mars an otherwise fine game to the point where I probably would not play again. I can't think of a promising cure, either, beyond the slight change that during setup, all attack action tokens placed in Europe are switched to somewhere harder to reach.

Played twice.

[b]First impression of the game?[/b]
This game is in my sweet-spot. Some area control, limited turns, efficient action expenditure. It has some of the best elements of my favorite games (Princes of Florence, Goa, Puerto Rico).

[b]What are the highlights?[/b]
I think the overall game design is pretty clever. It runs smoothly and yet offers a lot of strategic depth.

[b]What are the drawbacks?[/b]
I can see where the A/P prone may go into "lock up" overanalyzing each outcome.

[b]Who would enjoy this game?[/b]
Eurogamers and light wargamers will dig this title.

[b]Who would [i]not[/i] enjoy this game?[/b]
I can already hear the Ameritrash crowd moaning about "too dry" and "too systematic."

[b]Would you play this game again?[/b]
I would very much like to play this again. I am giving it a provisional "9" because the luster may wear off after 10 or so plays. But I look forward to that possibility...

A little chaotic for me, but I'd be willing to try it again.

It seems like a lot of options (take cards, for example) tend to help someone not in a great position less than the card that it opens up for someone in a stronger position.

Building does not seem like a viable strategy.

Second play was better.  Still not in love, though.

Whoa...what to say. I love the fixed 7 rounds that start slow and build along with the tension on what to do. It teaches easily since the first round is so short and sweet. I love the look in their eyes about how can this be good...it's silly.  Then by round 2 or 3 it's clicking...rut roh...this is good.

The random set up keeps it fresh. My only complains are setup time and counting points at the end is a bit of a pain but if I have to resort to complaining about that, it's that good.

A great blend of different mechanics (partially) seen in other top 'Euro' games that result in a great strategic game. This game is not revolutionary (even the theme is pretty standard), but everything seems to fit together really well!

At the start you're options are limited, so you are eased into the game. A few rounds later, you'll find yourself thinking a lot about your decisions. At the the end, you're musing about what you could have done better...

After 1 play:

I really enjoyed this game when I first played it.  Liked the contesting on the europe map, racing to dominate the particular colonial areas, the tough decisions about what tech to buy and what counters to acquire, trying to block opponents (and block them from enabling emancipiation when you are heavily reliant on slavery).

Great looking components too.

Would happily play again and suspect I'll suggest it at some point.  May rate it higher after more plays.

Endeavor is a really nice, mechanically tight, game.  Its nothing we haven't seen before but its just put together so darned well.  I imagine it as the love child of Goa, Web of Power, and Puerto Rico.  In fact, if I had a spare hour, I'm not sure if I'd play Web of Power twice or Endeavor once.  Endeavor is probably the Goa-killer for me.

In my head, I could see at least two expansions for this game, one with new buildings, a new action type, and perhaps an added miniboard (perhaps papal influence or some such). The other would go the Imperial 2030 route and provide a second board in an earlier or later time frame, or perhaps the Axis & Allies: Pacific route and play out on a smaller scale in a specific location. This would also make a fantastic space colonization game.

Only played once. I didn't get it, but I see something there. I'll need more plays (which I look forward to) to fully understand this one and better judge it. Until then I go with my first impression: 7/10 - better than most, not as good as others.
*UPDATE (Several more games played)* I want to like this as much as everyone else, but I just don't get it. I don't feel that I can create a clear strategy and feel that even if I could, it would have little effect. In addition, I feel that the game does not scale well with different number of players (2 vs 3 vs 4 vs 5), and a 2 player game is drastically different from a 5 player game. This means that you've got to play enough games with different number of players to know what strategy to implement and how much map you expect to get to play based on how many people are playing. Therefore, a new or even relatively new player will have a severe disadvantage to experienced players and will not have fun playing with them and will get thrashed in the end.

I really enjoy this game because of the skill progression and number of paths for strategy.  Each game always feels different and it doesn't appear there is a dominant "win all" strategy.  Great mechanisms, artwork, and component feel.  I might not win very often, but always a great gaming experience.

11/28/09 Played a three-player game. This may go up if I'm able to play a four or five player game. Right now I don't rate it higher due to it not playing well with three. Plus, the graphics on the board aren't the best. Those extremely long trade route lines are very hard to see the connections between the colonial areas and Europe. You almost have to put a finger on a trade route and trace it to make sure you aren't "jumping lines" and ending up in the wrong place. I saw several comments on BGG from people making the same complaint. As many stated on BGG, the game is somewhat like combination of Struggle of Empires and Goa. I thought that spot on. I like Endeavor. However its not a good as either of these pseudo-parents.

I saw the designer post he thought it quite normal/proper for many of the colonial area to not open up in a three player game. My view is history-wise this is ridiculous. I mean, could you imagine Spain, France and England deciding, "You know what, phooey on Africa and the Far East. That's too much trouble. We'll merely sail to the Americans and go no further." Yeah, right.  

03/13/10 Played a four-player game with the rules in the box. As I feared only three of six colonial area opened up. The variant should have been used to remove a chit from each trade route, but the owner didn't want to. 
08/28/10 Played a five-player game. As I expected, the game only truly shines with a full compliment. All six colonial areas were opened up.  
04/02/11 Played a three-player game with the variant of removing two chits from each trade route. This worked quite well. Five of the six colonial areas were open by game end. 
03/24/12 Ditto. 01/19/13 Ditto. 05/11/13 Ditto. 07/29/14 a four-player game. 09/12/15 a three-player game.

Exploration seems to be one of the themes of the moment. I've recently bought a few games which are thematically similar, if mechanically different.

I've now played this once and it was an interesting mix. My first building choice was the shipyard, which limited my early expansion - it seems the Workshop gives a better sprint start.

It seems to be a game that rewards efficiency, though time will tell whether I'm right or not.

Nice components, and I like the way your choices expand as the game develops, though sometimes it can be a curse when someone jumps on the one thing you wanted to do next.

I was extremely excited about the release of this game since it sounded like a beautiful variation of Puerto Rico with track-based advancements and area control.  But after a few plays, I'm not convinced that it will deliver on everything I had hoped for.  The game seems rather repetitive and I've had considerable difficulty determining how I should be handling the beginning of the game.  I can only assume it'll get much better once I get a good idea about what tracks are more important in different situations and I become more familiar with the cards.  I'm still holding out hope for this one, since I was so excited about it in the beginning; for now, I just need to play it more.

Just loses the quarter point for possible kingmaking concerns, but you should be able to avoid almost all of these by considering the big picture throughout.

I am continually amazed at how quick Endeavor plays for all of the mechanics it involves. The first few turns are lightning fast, and then you are in the end game. The dynamic board appeals to me as well. At the end of each game, I always feel like I have played a more complex game than I did. Excellent game for the 60m playtime. NOTE: Bumped up from an 8 to an 8.5 due to the awesome 2P variant which feels like a 3P game without much hassle or added workload. Great game.

Well balanced and somewhat unique feeling engine game that does not seem to have the run away leader problems I initially thought it would.  There is a good mix of short and long-term investments (depending on whether you send people to shipping lanes or onto the board).  There is teamwork, attacking, connection bonuses, etc.  It works really well for a quick and rather abstract game.

Quickly becoming one of our favorite games.

Interesting game for sure. What is basically a technology tree is implemented through a shared pool of upgrades, such that other players can "block" your path.

RATING: 8
Played twice; it's definitely one to play more than once, as I learned a lot during the first game. 

This is, to some extent, an area control game at its heart: players build up their ability to place workers on the board to control areas.  When placing workers on the board players get benefits, and must plan their moves to choose between being able to build better buildings, getting more workers, being able to use their workers more efficiently, or being able to hold more special power cards.  The buildings players can buy allow players to carry out more actions, but there aren't so many as to lead to confusion.  

One big problem we ran into in our first game is that the cannon building appears to be very strong.  In short, it allows a player to kill an opposing player's worker and replace it with one of their own.  There is no defense against this.  Unfortunately, this allows the attacking player to both get one-time benefits from building a bigger network and also gets them an advantage in controlling the area (since obtaining special-power cards requires a minimum number of workers in an area).  So, if one player is already ahead in an area (say, 3 to 2), then by doing one attack they are now at a 4 to 1 advantage, making it functionally impossible for the losing player to ever gain control of that area (especially since the benefits of building a network are one-time benefits, so even if the losing player attacks they can't get as many rewards).   

However, there are ways to gain influence that are immune from the cannon (by "shipping"), and thus if a player doesn't want to fight it out for influence they don't necessarily have to.  

After the first game I was concerned that the cannon mechanic will make the game frustrating (as, if used multiple times on a player it has the power to knock down players to a point where they can't recover), but I think it is okay, as long as players understand how it works and plan accordingly (either get cannons to fight it out, or avoid placing workers in cannon-prone areas.

Great game that attempts to mimic the early era of European colonization around the globe. Great limited "fighting" mechanism. Wonderful "slavery" mechanic. You may benefit but beware if you slave and the others abolish slavery. You will suffer. Always fun. Just so many darn small pieces to set up. Beward losing any of them. Has a cool 2-player variant with a Neutral Power, that plays different from the 3-5 player. Best with 4-5.

Nice game. Feels like a textbook euro. Many choices to make, you have a few different buckets to fill, and all are important. There's a little bit of combat, but it's costly so should be done sparingly. I seem good at the game, but it's 90% tactics and 10% strategy to me. I've enjoyed my first 4 or 5 games of Endeavor, but I could see the game wearing down with repeated plays. We'll see.

I enjoyed my one and only play of this, which seemed to pack a lot of features (development tree, mild conflict, resource management, networking, area influence) into a surprising small amount of time. Oddly enough, it reminded me a little of Olympos, another clean system that feels like a longer game in much less time. As with that title, I suspect this would get "samey" with repeatedly plays, despite the various ways in which both games try to mix things up. Regardless, consider me presently intrigued.

Really enjoying this game.  I love that the board is different every time since the chits will always be different.  Not sure of the best strategy but you definitely have to change depending on where the chits are and what others are doing.  Seems like a pretty tactical game.

It's remarkably odd that Endeavor and Hansa Teutonica came out in the same year, as they're basically the same game only sliced and diced in different directions. Hansa is combative, but mostly non-interactive. Endeavor has a really cool collusion mechanism in the shipping lanes, and a really cool timing mechanism reminiscent of the type of thing you find in a great worker placement game where you have to prioritize your action choices to prevent getting blocked by the other players or leaving anything too enticing open for them or even opening up new possibilities for them.

Hansa focuses on getting the various game actions ["getting more control markers", "deploying / redeploying control markers", "gaining better / more actions", "gaining bonus abilities", etc] into the right phasing and most of the player interaction seems to be about getting out of phase with the other players, while most of the strategy seems to be about optimizing your own action timing. Endeavor puts all of this into a very rigid order [while maintaining nearly all of the same action types as Hansa], making player interaction and strategy about what you do with the actions.

I've had people recommend me Hansa Teutonica time and time again when I ask for a game with a "broad" decision tree where you have a lot of options available to you on any given turn [something like Tigris or Antiquity], but I haven't felt compelled by the game at all the two or three times I've played. It strikes me as a very straight-forward Euro optimization / action timing game like Puerto Rico, Goa, Notre Dame, etc. There's just nothing interesting here to me. Endeavor is the game all of these well-meaning people should have been recommending to me all this time.

Excellent euro style game. It has a clever blend of mechanics with area control, worker placement, and set collection. The game is tight and so scores should be close at the end as there are multiple paths to victory. There is minor conflict which really makes the game tense and keeps players on their toes. Finally, the games has excellent variability (trade tokens random each game), a good balance between strategy and tactics, and is enjoyable from start to finish.

RATING: 8
Great Game. A winner for sure. Very simple but yet with so many things to do. Agonizing decisions and a lot of paths to victory. A little bit of the feel of Puerto Rico and Goa.

Play 2 games with 3 players in one night, first game 1h30 duration, second one 1h10m. 

Tomorrow I will try it with 4 players. I think it could be even better. 
One of my bets for the best game of 2009.
Congrats to the designers and Zman to find this jewel.

Day 2 - After a 2 more plays a few flaws has starting to appear in the game. A little more downtime then expected because of one of the players, and could have king making because of the battles.

The turn order have a huge importance in the game progress. Beware of bad play by the right player, just like Puerto Rico.

Because of this reasons I decided to downgrade my rating to an 8.

Thus, still an excellent game. 

5th game, 4 players. 1 hour. No AP, Sgrovi wasn't at the table. :)

Theme comes through beautifully and there are continual choices for your own actions and how they interact with others, as well as the challenge of balancing your economy and action options. Excellent and very enjoyable, not complex and everything makes sense.

In the new world, there are 7 rounds in this game. Each round, you construct a building. Next you collect colonists. Then you put colonists into buildings to take actions: (ship to Europe or one of the outlying regions, draw cards, attack another player). Then you put back colonists from occupied buildings into your supply, and start a new round. Each player has a player mat to track their abilities and the cards they collect.

This is a good game. Your actions are fairly simple, and there are many tough choices. There are some instances where it is possible to lose your token in your area when you are attacked, but it is expensive to attack. This game really grows on you, and forces you to make tough choices from turn to turn.

Nice middle-weight game with very elegant rules.

Maybe difficult to win by a big strategical plan, instead it seems it is won by the sum of many good tactical moves (I prefer strategy over tactics). But I may be wrong, and I want to play the game more to discover if it has more "substance".

Surely it is nice to play and to try new combination of buildings / ways to victory.

It is fast and this, together with the elegance of the rules, is a very good thing (even if it often seems to finish too soon).

UPDATE March 2013
There are so many games at the moment that I prefer to this that I decreased the rating accordingly.

Endeavor is a good game, but it puts up too many 'Do Not Purchase' flags to warrant ownership.

Primarily, the amount of choices available from outset are so vast and yet the number of actions per turn are so limited that, early on, novices are highly likely to make decisions that will negatively affect their progress for the rest of the game. Even the limited options for 1st turn building choices will massively affect future turns.

Fluctuations in player's tracks in later turns due to the gaining and discarding of cards can be difficult for some to keep track of correctly.

Later turns also are very limited in choices, making for analysis paralysis as players try to calculate the optimal course.

Finally, endgame scoring takes forever.

That said, I'd sit down to a game of Endeavor whenever, but in no way would I consider owning it.

RATING: 7
Puerto Rico mixed with...something else.  The idea of shipping and building up your play area reminds me of Puerto Rico.  There is no role selection. 

There is also alot of route making in this game.  Placing your tiles in the proper places to get you the good bonuses.  

Played this game 3 or 4 times and enjoyed so I picked it up...a year ago and still never had it hit the table.  Whether it is because I never felt the need to bring it out, or if no one is interested remains to be seen.

RATING: 7.5
Awesome game with a kind of 7 Wonders feel to it, in that it's an empire builder that abstracts away the concept of resource collection. Early rounds play super quickly, but this completely reverses in the later game as fewer available spots leads to much agonizing. Downsides are the very fiddly set up and end-of-game scoring sections.

Not sure it was that awesome the second time, but it did play even more quickly.

RATING: 9
Played once with SoloPlay's 2 player variant and 3 times with SoloPlay solitaire rules.

I really liked the concept behind this game based on reviews and feedback given.  It reduces the whole explore and exploit concept down to the combination of a few actions.

I think I like it so much because I get such a feeling of accomplishment through a really smooth economic engine.  Somehow the seeming disparate acts (Shipping, Occupying, Drawing/maneuvering politically for gain perhaps?) generates an increasingly powerful engine that allows me to do more.

I like that the randomness is in the setup.  And wow, is it ever random!  After that, it is your choices that matter.

I like fiddling with bits that matter.  All of those chips can and will make a difference.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I like variety

RATING: 8
First impression (3 players): Looks very abstract with only a hint of theme. Has a bit same feel as Homesteaders that you have fixed number of rounds (7 here) and the first 3 or so rounds go really fast as you don't have too many options. Then the turns start to take time after you have more things to consider and more actions to do. 

Not sure if there is enough variation to last for more than a few games but at least the first game was interesting enough so I want to play for a couple more. 

Probably best with 3 or 4 players.

Interesting stuff. Something I need to play a lot more of to consolidate my opinion. Some very apparent downsides, even first time around, are the need for players of equal ability (you can be screwed very easily by other players making sub-standard moves), and an easier accounting system. But there's a good core to this game, and something which positively invites further exploration (pun intended).

Easy to learn - I think it took like 15 minutes of explanation.

Conflict done well for a Euro.

What a cool game! (another play could easily increase the rating)

This is a total strategy game, where people can blow other people out of the water... I think it is really fun to play, and i love the multi dimensonal scoring aspect... So far I've only had the one "practice" game (with 4 people) but i think this game has good potential...

Quick thoughts:
it kind of feels a bit like most building games where if you invest wisely early on you can accelerate way ahead of the crowd..

the biggest strategical downside is that the winner could easily be the player that has no other player playing the same strategy. (not necessarly a fault though... but in order for it to be fair, everyone should have a good understanding of the game)

the biggest other downside to the game is that it is a little cutthroat (i dont mind that too much, but you should be aware of that if your going to play it)

the rules are involved, and if your not used to some of the eurogame mechanics it could take a while to understand

I would glady play again... i played with 4, i think that was a good number

Excellent game, one of the best I played in 2009. 

If chits are placed on the map completely randomly it is possible for 1st player to get an advantage. We check the board as a group, swap 1-2 pairs if required, then detarmine who will start.

For the depth of play, this is surprisingly easy to teach.

My relationship with Endeavor is very fickle.  I absolutely love this game when I win or look to be in a winning position.  When I lose I don't like it at all.  When I lose I don't feel like I have done much different to when I have won.  So the jury is still out on how the winner is determined - if its good play or bad play by the other players.

This just seemed boring.

Slavery doesn't seem to be as slippery a slope as I'd thought it would be, but then a slaver almost always needs a barracks to defend himself, or a huge presence in Europe.

I don't see why you would not hop on the band wagon when someone starts a shipping route; it doesn't seem to be correct to go off to Asia if everyone piles into Africa and the Caribbean, for example. Thus, the first person (or maybe the first 2 people) to start a shipping route seems to have the biggest influence on the mid-game.

More games may be needed.

It seems to have a good balance between a wide range of options and a very clean fast playing system. There is very little down time, and always a good range of choices to make. Based on only two plays my impression is that it has a good range of different strategies to pursue, and it doesn't seem to be the case that a balanced strategy is necessarily the best one. My only concern is that the very streamlined gameplay, which is one of the appeals, will result in lower replayability.

Sold my copy.
While being a very good game, it takes too much effort to set it up. Whenever our group thinks about the time it'd take to set it up, we rather pick other games to play.
Drop the score to 8 for that reason.

-----------------------------------------
A very nice game with short gaming time. 
Setup is a bitch though.

My favorite part about this game is that everyone start with some thing small, doing very little actions. But as the game progress, consequences of different initial strategy unfolds, doing a lot more actions. 

I'm really interested to try different strategy combination each time I play, disgarding whether or not I win the game.

It'll be interesting to see if the buildings provide enough strategic variety to generate ongoing interest in what is otherwise simply a place a piece, advance down a track type game, where the tracks provide enhanced powers (get more pieces, access better buildings) plus VPs Industrial Waste style. The cannons provide some leader hitting which I found somewhat out of place in an otherwise peaceful pursuit of abstracted happiness. It’s a solid Euro but the more I play it, the less enchanted I am with the cannon-hitting and the consequent king-makery exchange of points as the game nears its end.

RATING: 9
Neat game. Slight learning curve. The game starts out simple and slow, but ramps up nicely. AP alert. Teach the game well, encourage light and fast play, and the game will move along. Kindof a tactical point salad with a lot of denying other players of stuff. Wonderful graphics. Much replayability, though the only randomness in the game is from the token setup of the board. Not as heavy or meaty as Puerto Rico or Brass, but rather on the level of a Michael Schactht or a Wolfgang Kramer game. The 2 player variant is nice, but I have to believe that the sweet spot for this game is with 4 or 5 people.

Horrible rule book. Could use better immediate understanding on the action marker flow, easier understanding of what the shipping paths are, and who is allowed to go where.

"Mostly abstract action-point area-control game. I don't like area control, plus this one has some direct pvp attacks."

What I like:
- Finished in 90 minutes with 4p, 2 first-timers
- The basic flow of play is simple and clean
- There appear to be multiple paths to victory

What I don't like:
- Players are STRONGLY encouraged to take a slavery card
- It is way too hard to abolish slavery in a 4p game (and presumably 5p)
- The slavery card symbol is too hard to see from across the table
- Some of the rules are complex and hard to remember
- There are some direct attacks

It's a decent game, but no way is it worth $70 or more.

I think the BGG-voted 2.9 weight is a reasonable assessment, partly because it "feels" like a serious game.

Another fine game of Essen 09!
The first few round are over very quick. The game gets more tense in the last 3 rounds. and feels a little bit short because of this. Have to play this more before deciding its final rating.

At the beginning the choices are much easier to make as you place tokens on the board and collect a few cards, but as the game progresses you must try and open other areas and hopefully be the mayor in them (have the most tokens) in order to get bonus cards and be able to grab the better cards. At the end, you must chose your actions carefully and ensure you have the right buildings to perform these actions. Another great from Essen.

Evitai di provare Endeavour/Magister Navis a Essen perché a un primo impatto rimasi dubbioso: da una parte l'ottima grafica a tema dei componenti (edifici, plance, carte), dall'altra il tabellone di gioco poco convincente per i miei gusti. 
Magister Navis è un gioco con buonissime idee (gli indicatori della nazione che determinano il livello di costruzione, popolazione, economia e politica), meccaniche tradizionali ben implementate (le maggioranze nelle colonie che indicano la qualità di carte acquistabili) e qualche finezza (la carta che abolisce la schiavitù mettendo in crisi chi fino a quel momento l'ha sfruttata). Poi il gioco scorre liscio come l'olio e ha una durata contenuta. Il gioco però conferma le mie impressioni in terra tedesca. Tutta quell'ambientazione, ben resa e molto presente nelle plance di ogni giocatore, viene meno nel tabellone: poco più di un grafo molto, troppo astratto per quello che dovrebbe rappresentare. Il criterio stesso di assegnazione casuale dei segnalini nelle città neutrali e nei collegamenti (senza nessuna specificità geografica) non aiuta a togliersi dalla bocca quel sapore di astratto che potevi "vestire" senza problemi con un'ambientazione spaziale, medievale o contemporanea. 
I pregi sono comunque superiori ai difetti e il gioco è tutto sommato molto carino.

I like the global colonization theme  The art is great.  It is highly interactive, sweetly balanced and nuanced.  I think of it as a Hansa Teutonica Light, which is just fine by me. Not all groups need the intensity of HT.

In this game, you need to make the best use of your buildings to advance on four different tech tracks and put ownership markers on the board.  I really appreciate the interaction in claiming different areas and the different strategies that the buildings represent.  However, I'm a little worried that once people play this a bunch, a particular strategy will become dominant.  Also, I didn't like that it was significantly more difficult to end slavery with 5 players.

Seems like an unnecessary overcomplication of a better, simpler game and an unnecessary oversimplification of a better, more complex game. Simultaneously.

One more play. A slight adjustment down to 7,5. Not sure about this yet.

I could say Endeavor felt a bit like a mix between Struggle of Empires, AoEIII, Puerto Rico and ...um... Thurn & Taxis. But that would probably not say much anyway - thing is, Endeavor plays very unique.

More abstract than I anticipated, more abstract than SoE of course, but Endeavor also had less richness in theme and feel than both AoEIII and Puerto Rico as well. There was almost a sense of remoteness to the setting.

A couple of strategies that can be combined in a multitude of ways, an "easy to overview but hard to predict" kind of game. I had fun playing this one and I bet it has strong replayability.

One play so far - rating may change

Nice game with a light theme and a board that changes some elements with each game. It's also surprisingly quick for how strategic it is. Since balance is key, it is difficult to find a "one" way to win like other games. So it is very replayable. Not bad at all.

First, when you get down to it, Endeavor provides nothing new. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and that doesn't make it a bad game, but it does mean I can get my fix in other games I think are better.

Second, the game feels overly balanced. I've tried multiple strategies, but they really aren't so different. I found that all strategies led to the same end. Increase A to facilitate the increase of B/C/D to facilitate the increase of A/C/D, etc... A high level of specialization is a losing strategy because you need some of everything. The only difference is where you start, thus repeated plays started to feel the same regardless of how I proceeded to increase my tracks. Highly tactical.

Third, in my experience the game is won and lost in the cards. It's probably not all that surprising, but you can't win without taking higher numbered cards. However, the cards just aren't that interesting. Higher levels provide moderate increases over lower levels, but acquiring the cards you want/need can be tedious.

Ultimately, to me it's a pretty dull exercise in efficiency and min/maxing. The game likes you to think you have all kinds of strategic choices, but all you've really got is a couple hours of tactical reactions to the current state of the game when it gets back to your turn. Additionally, while the game plays better with more players, it also increases the play time to such a degree that it isn't worth the time investment, but playing with three players doesn't provide enough tension to make the game worthwhile.

Having said all that, I enjoyed my plays, but it has run its course.

I've played this game 3 times, each time with 3 players.  I don't think it scales well,  I anticipate that it will be best with 4 and better with 5.

I think that with 3 the focus is on Europe/Med early on and other areas don't get opened up in a timely fashion.  So, whomever get to go first gets a leg up.

RATING: 7
There's little meat to sink your teeth in, but there are more than enough options and strategies to keep things interesting for a long time. That's pretty impressive for a game of its length (not very long) and weight (not very heavy).

I prefer games with a big central mechanism to compete over, which Endeavor hasn't got. Each player can more or less find his or her own way in order to maximize points, so there's little tension. I generally dislike this type of game, but Endeavor is pleasant and varied enough, and there is just enough competition and interaction that I don't mind playing it at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Endeavor has some familiar Euro mechanics cleanly implemented with the interesting problem of trying to maximise your meeple power. A continual problem for me though is that I can't get excited when the scoring status is so scattered and fragmentary. Another strike against the design is there is no hidden information to promote uncertain tension. The other offputting element is the attacking is too easy to carry out (so long as you have enough meeples) and there is no means of defence so your mental considerations feel wasted.

Touted as the next step up after Settlers....hmm don't think so, it doesn't have any inherent fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great game which I think can be categorized as a veiled  worker placement game- placing discs instead of meeples. Very polished, engaging, and with lots of interesting and thoughtful decisions.
The one negative is that in the 5-player game the downtime is increased somewhat since there is bound to be some A/P during some moves. But even then it's a great game.

Really fun game of putting out discs to create sailing lanes to colonial areas of the world and mess with your opponents.  Building the engine in this game is a lot of fun.  Wish this would come back into print.  I like attacking people in this game even when I know it's not the best idea!

RATING: 7
This game is like an onion. Each time I play I have peeled off another layer. I don't even think I'm past the skin yet. Very accessible, yet deep. My complaints are: It falls into the common Euro trap of a weak theme. Naming the cities would have gone a long way to mitigating this and would have taken next to no work. And, as with any multiplayer game wherein you can attack the other players, a player who manages to avoid conflict will tend to do better--this is not guaranteed however, and overall I think combat is implemented well.

After reading the rules I was intrigued. After playing my first game I was impressed. I was surprised at how quickly the game ramped up in seven turns and I was surprised by the effectiveness of the Attack action. The game itself is elegant but feels rather bland after a few plays. This game quickly fell into the "been there, done that" category for me.

RATING: 9
Still loving this fantastic game of balancing your tableau improvements and board presence with lots of interaction. Across 7 rounds, you choose a new building and add it to your player board. Then your player board's stats in various categories determine how many disks you get. When a building's action allows you to place a disc on a space, you collect the token that was randomly assigned to that space at the start of the game. Between the spaces are routes, and when you claim both sides of the route, you also claim the token between them. New areas open up as ship disks come to the board, and powerful cards become available for players who invested discs into those regions. The ultimate goal is to hold spots on the board, and increase the stats on your player board to their highest scoring threshold through collecting those tokens or cards.

It's a fantastic game of balancing your tableau building with your board presence and lots of player interaction as players vie to be the one to finish a route, or compete over tokens or knock other players out of locations. The game demands 4 or 5 players to shine, because it doesn't have any scaling for fewer player counts, but it's one of those really elegant and satisfying mid weight euros .

RATING: 7
I was slightly underwhelmed by Endeavor on my first play, but afterwards I realised that was because I'd been expecting something more thematic and involved. Reading some of the interesting articles by the designers made me realise how well they'd achieved their goal of a slick, fast-playing development game. It's impressively easy to explain to newcomers, can comfortably play in 20 mins per player and offers lots of choices, both strategic and tactical. My second play was really enjoyable as I could actually decide on a plan and optimise it. My only slight criticisms revolve around its almost abstract nature. There's nothing to really distinguish the different areas you are colonising (not even names for the cities) and so you're just hunting for the symbols that match your strategy. The only exception is the abolition of slavery mechanic; it might have been nice to have a few more of these 'bells and whistles', but I can also see why the designers sacrificed them in the interests of elegance. Other minor niggles are the fiddly set-up and the potential for AP when drawing and discarding in the final round.

European colonial expansion. I like the random placement of tokens to represent the exploration aspect, this will keep repeated plays fresher. 
Much of the position building aspects is reminiscent of Goa, and works fairly well.

While Endeavor has it points it is not a game I can get excited about. It seems too bland for the era it is representing. However, as a Euro it could grow on me. After playing it a few times it has grown as solid game on the era.

A very good game. The rules are clear, the game plays relatively fast, specialy for that level of game. The material is O.K. The set up is a little bit long but the game plays so well that you won't mind. This game will find it's way out of the closet a lot because the game as it's share of reflection without risking falling into A.P. Even if there is almost no direct conflict between players but you always have to be on the lookout of your oppenents moves that will influence you game play.
Note: In a 3 player game, you better close one colony in order to create more traffic in the others.
I highly recommand that game

Un bon jeu. Les règles sont claires et les parties sont rapides pour ce type de jeu. Le matériel est O.K. Le placement initial est un peu long mais le jeu coule si bien que oublierai vite cet inconvénient. Ce jeu sortira souvent car c'est un bon jeu de réflection qui ne tombe pas dans la P.A. Même s'il n'y a pas de conflits directes entre les joueurs, vous devez toujours surveiller les actions des autres joueurs car celles-ci auront des répercussions sur votre jeu.
Note: A trois il faut absolument fermer une colonie afin de créer plus de circulation dans les autre colonies.
Je recommande grandement ce jeu.

A lighter version of Struggle of Empires. Less direct conflict and no alliances. Still, a neat efficiency machine game with enough interaction to make it worthwhile. The rules are simple but there are many strategies to go for and many options you have, especially in the early stage of the game. A bit more randomness would have please my chaotic nature but it does not feel incomplete without. Neat and tranquil artwork etc. rounds the experience up. Good one.

I don't really see anything too special about Endeavor.  The mechanics seem neat, but somehow it doesn't really excite me. 

I enjoy the tech tracks.  Not enough games have tech tracks.  They are fun because they allow (force) you to explore different aspects of the game based on what is available and what strategy you want to employ.  

The map is neat and kind of different but somehow the tech tracks and the map doesn't add up to a game with any excitement.  Perhaps it's because it is too easy for the same people to pursue the same strategy because there isn't enough building variety.

Another high quality euro with some fresh mechanics.  At first glance, it seems like there are a lot of paths to victory.  However, the game starts too slow, develops too quickly, and in the end, you need to cover too many paths to achieve success.  So, it's really a lot of different ways to end up in the same place.  It's still an excellent game, but it could have been so much more . . .

Great game.  You push your civilization forward in Europe while shipping to and occupying various parts of the world.

You have to decide which parts of the map you should strive to control.....which of the 4 elements of your civilation you should develop first......whether you should ship first, get more powerful buildings/actions first, collect cards.  So there is some strategy involved.   There is also some tactics and postioning involved.

Give it a try....you won't be disappointed.

 Very smooth gameplay with lots of options during the phases. Should have good replayablity as you try different strategies in deciding which buildings to construct, where to ship and occupy and who to attack in-order to get better placement later in the game.

RATING: 7.12
Endeavour operates by placing workers, which in turn enhances your score-track in one of four different 'progress' ratings. These then supply more workers or resources. And so on.
It escalates quite nicely, each player getting more and more actions with each passing round (there are seven in total). There is a lot less player interaction than in other games of this general type (Age of Empires/Caylus/Keymarket/Le Havre) but over-all I think the game is all the better for it. It feels tight and streamlined, with simple easy to learn but genuinely difficult to master mechanics.

Game starts of slowly (players have nothing) and then builds and builds.  The first few turns you will wonder how you get anything done, but it picks up nicely for the middle and the end.

Didn't care much for the "chicken" aspects or having to fall on my sword to prevent another player getting a plum.  I dunno...I want to try again, maybe with more than three.

UPDATE: More than three was a negative, not an improvement.  More players acting between my turns meant watching lots of opportunities arise and get gobbled up before I had a chance to act.  If I do play again, I'll certainly be more likely to choose fighting as a strategy.  Still, lots of unpleasant games of chicken, frustratingly slow development, and other un-fun elements.

--Sep2009-- I found it quite intriguing.  The worker placement economy is pretty tight; the board placement delightfully reminiscent of _Taj Mahal_; and scoring is amusingly chunky.

RATING: 5
It tries somewhat, but a pretty theme-less track-racing competition, with a board element that rewards a good sense of the game's timing. A whiff of take-that, but not so much to offend any except the most squeamish (read: "ME").

Best with the full five player count. Any less hurts the game. It is rather fragile in that way. I'm surprised the designers couldn't think of ways to make it scale better. But instead, they appear here on BGG insisting that it works fine with three :surprise:

A new game combining elements from Puerto Rico, Goa and Phoenicia. The game is very balanced and fun and quick to play. The theme fits well although the playing itself feels somewhat abstract. I like this type of game where there is progress and a lot of options on how to proceed forward.

One play with 5p. It seemed to be a very slow ramp up which had me thinking we were doing something wrong. But I think we did it right. I'm nbot sure this justifies the large price and high rating it has. Rated 6 for now. I will play again and see if i missed something.

It packs quite a lot it for its short time and simplicity. It is, however, a little too abstract and sometimes you can find yourself forgetting about what the other players are doing (although that is more an indicator of poor play by the players than poor design from the designer).

For the kind of game it is, it does it quite well. I like the building mechanic, and the placement on the board is quite engaging while you're playing. Still, it definitely has that been-there, done-that feeling, and the combat aspect feels half-baked to the point of being annoying.

RATING: 8.5
Very nice Empire-themed game. Interesting mechanism with cumulative worker placement. Strategy is allowed as each turn provides more options for placing workers and more workers, with the balance being needed between getting and spending workers and aiming for dominance in certain actions - whilst at the same time map placement and action selection allow for tactical interaction between the players. 

I don't think I own a game that quite-so-effectively synthesizes these various elements.

A good game. Looks complicated when set up but ends up simple and quick-playing. Mainly it's about balancing growth of workers, money, actions. The random token layout changes the possible ways to do so. The network map is a bit of a strain on the eye.

RATING: 9
In Endeavor you are trying to win glory for your empire through occupying cities, opening trade routes, becoming governor of a new region, and expanding the wealth, culture, and political prowess of your empire.  The game lasts 7 rounds, in which players, in turn, each build one building, then gain new workers, then pay the salary of last turn's workers, then take actions (governed by the buildings they have built).  Players must balance their ability to build, their ability to recruit new workers, their ability to pay for the workers they have, with their ability to open shipping routes and occupy cities.

At the end of the game cities are worth points, advances in building, culture, money, political influence, some cards, and any recruited but idle workers are worth points.  Players can also gain an extra point for each pair of adjacent cities.  The tension in the game is bound up in managing limited resources within only 7 turns.  Players are also capturing cities or opening trade routes vying for the better position on the board.  Players can interact by using an attack action, which is costly but can gain that coveted city.

The game has a good depth and breadth of strategy.  The board layout is randomized each game play, so the replay value is high; no two games will employ the same tactics, and may require different strategies.

A decent, rather quick (although the setup is not so quick) and somewhat abstract medium Euro. If you're a fan of Puerto Rico growing a bit tired of it, it might suit you (although the gameplay is completely different). It lacks it's wonderful tight resources and blocking, which makes it overall an inferior game I think, but at least much prettier. Still, I'll join a game when proposed (if I don't have time for anything bigger), which is more than I can say for most other games.

RATING: 7
Enjoy the combination of worker placement and civilization development, enjoy the theme, thumbs up. Cons include fiddly set up and, perhaps, the merest suggestion that this might be a game that has been a smidgeon over-developed, with a somewhat committee-created feel to it. Glad that they were able to include both slavery and conflict in a game themed on colonialism, it would have been a little bit silly without them. 

Edit: Weird how this one dropped so quickly out of favour in gaming circles. Merits - speed of play, simplicity, variability of set-up, excellent component production. Best with 4 or 5.

Seems like there are multiple ways to play, and with just the right amount of aggression for my taste - it has purpose because it's usually used to secure a connection. It's kind of light and forgiving, with the need to plan ahead a little bit. Unfortunately it's also very, very fiddly and has had a surgical theme extraction for the sake of Germanising the game. It's all stuff we've seen before, but this game turns it all into something I'll be happy to explore quite a bit further.

The spelling irks me. I'll be selling my USA copy and replacing it with the German one - a nicer box size to boot.

It would also be really nice if future editions had the city names on the board. It would allow me be more descriptive during the game rather than just saying "this city" and "that city" while pointing.

This game is like an improved mix between [i]Puerto Rico[/i], [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=105&Itemid=1]Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery[/url][/i] and [i]Struggle of Empires[/i].  It not only uses a worker placement mechanic, but players can choose the actions that they may perform.  That, together with some nice decisions about combinations as the players put their chips in the map, makes an excelent game, one of the best of the last few years.  Besides, it plays very fast.

I've just scratched the surface of this one, but I'd be happy to dig deeper. So many meaningful decisions each turn. Everyone starts out slowly, and your engine ramps up until the game flies by. If you build a crummy engine, it will sputter along. But if you build a good engine, it's a thing of beauty. 

4 seems to be the sweet spot for this, for the same reasons that Taj Mahal is best with 4--though they're nothing alike otherwise.

Interesting game with a number of things going on.  The first couple of turns you think "Only seven turns in this game, what can you possibly accomplish."  But by turn 4 your realize things are moving much more quickly.

An excellent perfect-information game, with enough variation (e.g. in the initial token placements) to sustain interest for me over multiple games.  I haven't seen an X-factor in it that would push it into the echelon of truly great games for me, but for the moment I'm very happy to see it continue to hit the table.  The fact that it's designed by New Zealanders is the icing on the cake.

RATING: 8
A nice 60 min game that plays out based on the arrangement of the resource tokens on the board. As a result each game will be different, and you adjust your strategy based upon the resources available to you.

Minor niggles for new players:
The Crate icon, represents goods, and means pick up a card. Its not immediately obvious what a crate does, an icon of a card would have been better. 

Some of the card limiting and pick-up card rules are a little fiddly to understand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A thin engine-builder with a topographical adjunct that is about opportunity instead of maneuver. There are a handful of new and interesting things happening in this game that have not been replicated elsewhere. Reminds me a bit of the best Schacht games in how much is done with so little.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think of the game as supporting two main play styles, and combinations between the two. There is macro, which is mostly about taking culture and finance at every opportunity, and there is teching, which is all about getting and using more efficient buildings. You can go to one extreme or take a more balanced approach. 

The way attacks work, if someone gets attacked repeatedly throughout the game, it is very difficult for them to win. Most of the points come from the tracks, but you can get some from cards, some from buildings, and some from the board. Having some board presence is important, because colonize is so points efficient. 

There is a good amount of strategy, you can pursue different paths throughout the game, and it plays fast. When I play with experienced players, games usually take about 45 minutes.

The ideal combination - simple mechanics, complex strategy.

Un juego de los que me gustan, de peso medio, fácil de enseñar, de duración contenida y muy divertido. Si bien tiene un número de turnos fijo (7 turnos), no he detectado una sensación de que fuera necesario un turno más. Además, tiene un curva de juego muy apropiada para las primeras partidas, porque los dos primeros turnos sirven de aprendizaje, al sólo poder hacer uno o dos acciones en cada turno.

Lo peor, que es extremadamente abstracto y que brilla necesariamente a 5 jugadores, por la inexistencia de limitaciones de zonas en función del número de jugadores.

Un gran juego, muy recomendable.

This is a really fun and quick-moving area control and engine building game.  Area control usually isn't my thing, but it's done really well and there are some tough choices to be had.  I especially liked that I was able to win, even though I didn't have a lot of presence in the cities.  I unlocked regions and built up my board.  Really good game and I'm glad that I finally decided to try it before selling it.

RATING: 10
I helped playtest Endeavor, and loved it every time. One major change suggested by Z-Man after they accepted it from Carl&Jarrat moved it from being "great" to "awesome" - they put tokens & glory points in between the cities to be earned only if you got the cities on both sides - adding another layer of interaction and making the military option a lot more effective.  

Here are the key things I like about this game: 

It's short! Can even take less than an hour if everyone knows what they're doing, but even if they don't it should never take more than 2 hours. 

Given how short it is, it handles a *lot* of aspects of its theme in an elegant and abstract sort of way: Expansion, war, shipping, trade, colonization, slavery, culture, finance, politics - who would of thought you could fit all of that into a light/medium weight 60-90 minute game? 

It's "luckless" - after the initial random setup of the board chits, which are visible to everyone, there's no luck involved at all, except the choices of your fellow players, which you can influence...

There's no real downtime or analysis paralysis - every turn requires a fair bit of thought, but there's no point in thinking things too far ahead because what the other players do is always going to affect what you can or should do next. 

Oh, and now I've finally played on a real board rather than a paper prototype, I can confirm the artwork and component quality are absolutely top notch!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Optimisation withing a minimal frame of options is for me the lowest circle of gaming hell. Because the only way to figure it out is to internalise arbitrary pieces somebody (i.e. designer) threw in the game box by rote learning and then figure out a way these go together, because designer couldn't be bothered with this. PG: FM has nice looking visuals (better, more evocative than Power Grid itself), but Endeavor is just ... lost in the sea of bland pastels which also hides the actual geography the game uses for reasons unknown. I mean, if you want a boring MPS game of optimisation of ship movement in the age of explointation of colonies, then look into Navegador. It's as brown, but at least has Geography. And it's also dull and soulless, but not soul and mind crushing.

[9 plays] The first time we tried this we enjoyed Endeavor so much we decided to play it again immediately. I love that. 

Endeavor is cleverly crafted and well balanced. The artwork and graphic design is nicely done. The theme isn't deep, but there's enough to tie all of the elements together in a way that makes sense.

Most importantly, the decisions are tense, the turns move quickly, and the game is a blast to play. Subsequent plays have confirmed that this game is right up my alley. Love it.

Solid if somewhat derivative Euro that steals elements from Puerto Rico and games of its kind.

After my first play I shrugged and said, "meh." But I was convinced to play it again a few more times and now I love this game.

Every decision creates opportunity for someone else to exploit. I enjoy this game plenty.

Played one game.  A nice game with no hidden information and no randomness except for the setup.  Most of the time you are presented with interesting decisions regarding which actions to take, in terms of which status track it will increase, which future options it opens up for you and your opponents (particularly with drawing and shipping), and how many glory points it is worth.

The end makes you feel a bit like a bean counter.  Also, the disconnect between map control and status track levels feels weird.

Simple rules and deep game play make this game a winner.

This is just a solid design.  All the parts work together and this is one fine tuned machine - it's one fast and lean Euro.  Endeavor is more forgiving than Princes of Florence but it has that same angst created by a fixed number of turns.  The gaming payoff here is setting up a powerful turn 6 and 7.  I also love the fact there is direct conflict for control of the board - something a lot of Euros are afraid to tackle - but it's done right here - not random, nasty and worthwhile.  In my opinion right now given the length of play time, the ease of teaching the game, and the multiple strategies - this THE medium-light weight Euro to have in your collection.

Nagy elődökből merít ez a jól összerakott, nagy újrajátszhatósági faktorú játék.
Meríti a Goából a fejlesztési részt. Meríti a Puerto Ricóból a munkásokkal aktiválható épületeket. A játékosok felfedezők bőrébe bújva próbálnak városokat foglalni és új területeket hajózással meghódítani. Ennek a hajózási résznek a megvalósítása nagyon jól sikerült. Minden meghódított városért és hajózásért különféle előnyök szerezhetők, amelyek nagyobb építési lehetőséget, több embert, több pénzt (az emberek újra munkába állását növeli), több előnykártya kézben tartást eredményezik. A különböző előnyöket kis korongok jelképezik, amelyek minden játékban teljesen véletlenszerűen kerülnek fel a rengeteg helyre, ezzel növelve az újrajátszhatóságot. Ezen felül kártyák is vannak, amelyek további előnyöket adnak. Jól összerakott játék, amiből talán az ágyúzás, az egymás városainak elfoglalása lehetőséget kihagytam volna.

A fun blend of area control with some Goa-style player boards plus a few other elements.  It plays up to 5 and I think that is probably close to the optimum number of players.  Even in a 4 player game, it seems difficult to get more than 2 or 3 areas open before the last turn.  It is a little difficult to tell who is ahead before the scores are counted up at the end.  We were surprised at who ending up winning.  This can lead to several people ganging up on someone who isn't even really in contention.  Overall though, pretty solid.

This game is like a funny car race.  You put the pedal to the medal.  You question how you will get anything done by the end of the game, but soon you see how you rip from zero to 270 mph. You pick a strategy and see if it works as you barrel to the end.    

This is Goa for those that don't dig auctions and wish it had direct conflict and a map.

This game always feels fresh - Due to the setup of the disks on the board and the need to react to your opponent's strategies, your tactics always need to be flexible to take advantage of the board conditions ...

This is a game I would never want to part with ...

My enthusiasm for this one is somewhat hampered by the fiddly setup. 95 little chips (better not lose one!) all have to go onto individual spaces on the board. The mechanics are nice, though, and there actually is some theme to it.

At first, during the rules explanation, it seems overwhelming, then it seems like it's going to last about 30 minutes, and then it gets brain-hurty. I really like how the game restricts the players actions in the beginning, and then through the balancing act of Industry, Culture, Money, and Something (forgot what the card limit is called), the game gets bigger and bigger. Really fun.

Easy to learn, completely intuitive after one round, wonderfully elegant interweaving of the roles of components as they move from the map to your player board and back.  A higher degree of player interaction than I had anticipated at first glance, welcome opportunities for blocking or frustrating the goals of other players, and at least once a game you have to make a brutal choice between two things you absolutely must do, but can do only one.  Neat ramp up of pacing -- slow and leisurely in the first two rounds, frantic and tense in the last two.  All that in less than 90 minutes!  A winner.

This is a decent game, but I'm surprised at how highly it is now ranked.  It does play quickly and has some nice choices, although the theme is a bit thin.  Toward the end of the game, your choices are a bit limited, however, and there was nothing about this game that struck me as particularly new or original, although it is pretty fun to play.

There are several things I don't like about Endeavor, starting with the fiddly setup and ending with the points-for-everything scoring. It's an optimization game with individual player boards, and some people like that, but I usually don't. It's reasonably brisk, short, and there's a map with territory to fight over, so it's not a solitaire experience. The individual player boards are for bookkeeping more than anything. If I were more into optimization games, I might like Endeavor. The way slavery is handled is clever mechanically but a bit disconcerting in the same way as Puerto Rico.

It's a pretty interesting game! You build buildings, which grant you special powers. But you only get to build 7 of them! You use the building powers to place pieces on the board, move them around (attack), get more pieces from supply, etc. You get VP both by position on the board, and by winning the VP cards. 

I can see why it got all the good reviews -- I'd certainly like to play it again although I'm not sure I need to own it. On the other hand, there's not a lot I feel I need to own these days!

First game was very confusing in terms of WHAT to do, moreso than a game like this should be. I think its visual clutter and lack of internal logic makes it a hard game to jump into it, which is unfortunate because it's actually quite a good mid/low complexity euro with some fun decisions and direct conflict.

Second game was way more enjoyable than the first, and I can see myself coming back to this one in the future.

RATING: 7
All the moves are interrelated, evidence of a solid game design.  It's interesting how the game looks difficult and really isn't very easy to explain, but once you play a round or two it all makes sense.  Reminds me of Goa with the balancing act between the different levels you're trying to reach.  My main criticism is the endgame feels unsatisfying. Also, there might not be enough building options.  Part of it feels a bit too programmed.  Still, there are enough choices and a relatively quick playing time to rank as a good game, just not a great one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a reasonably uncomplicated game where almost all the decisions seem to be based on opportunity costs and that makes it very, very interesting.

The majority of the game involves taking control of areas of a map in order to collect symbols that improve your abilities as well as unlock new areas and draw cards, also with symbols on them.  The reason so much of the game involves opportunity costs is because every time you take an action you open up new possibilities for other players.  When you take a spot on a shipping lane you make a new symbol available to your opponents and you also progress towards a card draw for the player with majority.  When you take a colony opponents need to decide whether to take the corresponding symbol to prevent you from collecting an additional symbol and also whether they even want to have the corresponding symbol and whether the additional symbol even helps you much.  There's also a lot more.

This is a neat game because it is so accessible and considering all this stuff makes for a deep and rich experience.  There's always a balance to consider between progressing the game and what you are giving up to others by progressing it because you always have the opportunity to stall but this can create stand-offs.  Very well designed and interesting system.

I was kind of disappointed on this one. It's a fair game with some difficult choices but it doesn't add anything new. It's a classic eurogame, short in gameplay and excellent components. I won't mind playing it occasionally because it has no mistakes. It's a solid design. I guess it doesn't work that well with 3 players only.

One of the things I like on this game it's the fact that it has several paths to victory. In that sense it's not a dry mechanical game. Players can find different strategies and aiming VP's in a different manner.

I don't like the fact that players need other players help to make discoveries because it always seem unfair to a third party if someone helps a player getting an extra action token.
Military actions seem quiet relevant to gameplay and I really think that it is the most important aspect of the game because it determines a few but major tweaks to final scoring. Military actions are not that expensive and are not avoidable thus being fundamental to the game result.

Setup is dull.

From reading the rules and making assumptions about the theme i thought this might be a not so good Struggle of Empires/Age of Empires 3. Not so.

Very quick play, all information open. Lots of tactical and strategic choices to be made. Lots of different ways of to appraoch the game (building v chits)

V much looking forward to first face to face.

So good i'm wondering what the  catch is - whether being great out of the box means it won't take repeated play?

Rating 10 after six plays. (now 8 after 16....)

Not enjoyed as a three player game, less areas open less options, feels a little scripted

I wonder if there might be a small turn order issue? Going early in the first round means you get the available action tokens.

I played a demo of this at Gencon a couple years ago and it wasn't described as well as it could have been(or its possible that I was sleep deprived) and I missed the attack options.  Imagine my suprise where in this seemingly dry euro, someone starts blowing my shit up.  I was immediately soured and it quickly dropped off my radar.  But then soemone brought it out at a recent game night and I knew that I needed to give it a second shot.  Well, I am glad I did.  It is a decent worker placement, with a little bit of competition and a smattering of conflict. 

The random chit placement adds a little replayability, but really I don't think your strategy is tied that closely to the token placments.  Sure, the token placemnet will alter your choices on where to place your workers; but overall if you (for example) like a shipping strategy, you are not going to have to abondon that strategy based on the token distribution.  

My opinion went from meh, to I'd play it again. I increased my rating for a 5 to a 7.

Pretty typical eurofare. Again, lots of ways to score, but in this case there at least seems to be some connecting game mechanism. You have to pick your path, not just score some points in many different categories (and carefully optimizing your actions).

just one, 3-player game so far, but looks extremely promising.  The rules and actions are very simple and straightforward, and the the only luck is the chit randomization at the start of the game.  Since that random factor is completely open, this lends the game to some great strategy-play.  There is just a bit of tactical play as you respond to the other players' plays, but on the whole the main action is strategic.  This looks to place the game in one of my favored categories--games where you define your strategy at the very beginning of the game and the clash comes where those strategies collide.

Good stuff and highly likely to go up in score as we play more!

+ Not everybody agrees, but I feel the theme works
+ The turns start out short and get progressively longer as the game advance for a nice learning curve
+ Relatively short play time for the type of game even with 5 players
+ Highly tactical you have to think to repercussion of your move and how to best optimize your empire
+ The randomization of the token means good replay value

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Pretty boring with 3 players as most region don't open up.
- It's pretty fiddly with all the cards, discs, cubes and tokens. Also needs lots of table space with the player boards.
- The end game needs some work.  If you're the player in the lead be prepare to be bombarded

For the playing time and the replay value involve, this is a great game for 4-5 players.  I like the tactical nature of the game, but hate the cannon fest that ends the game.

I'm pretty sure the game's name comes from the fact that it is another fairly dry cube-pusher that's "endeavoring" to pass itself off as a thematic game.  It's not a bad game, though.  It's a delightfully simple game to learn, and the various game elements do make thematic sense in their own abstract way.  With enough players, there's a decent amount of player interaction in the form of competition for various things and the occasional bit of rather costly direct confrontation.  However, the experienced players in our 5-player game were united in their belief that the game ONLY plays well with 5 players, no fewer.  My own opinion based on a single play was that the game was decent enough and I would play it again if asked, but it wasn't interesting enough for me to request another play.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

A good, solid euro that I'll happily play but can't imagine ever [i]choosing[/i].

There's an interesting balance of choices in the early game but I don't like the way shipping becomes useless. What I really don't like is what happens with combat in the final turns -- it seems that often attacks by players who are not competitive can play kingmaker among those that are.

Edit: A few years on and I do not feel it has been improved by time. A number of friends rave about this one and I don't understand the appeal. There's not that much going on, there are often elements of inadvertent kingmaking, and I think there is an uncompensated turn order advantage early in the game. Ratings history: 7 -> 6 -> 5.5

Interesting game to play, solidly designed.  Reminds me of Notre Dame in that a certain number of events transpire and everybody tries to harvest points from the sequence... but Endeavor seems to be heavier, and I like that.

Overall enjoyed learning this game would go out of my way to try it again.

4/23/10: I'm not sure I get the insane love this game is getting lately.  It's not [b]bad[/b], but it's not super-spectacular, either.  There are aspects that I feel like I should like a lot--I'm a big fan of developing a civilization by building up tech, and games where it feels like there are many valid strategies.  But something just feels really quite bland here.  Plus I think the board's graphic design is confusing and unattractive (though the player boards and cards are nice), and the setup is annoying.  I'll play it again, it's interesting and I do get that "Next time I'll get it right" that some of my favorite games (Through the Ages, Le Havre) give me, but something about Endeavor just doesn't really catch me.

It's Puerto Rico meets Goa, but it has some nice tactical, geographical elements that make it much less abstract than either of its predecessors. Oh, and it has the guts to call a slave a slave.

Single play, treated as a learning game, with many fundamental implications & repercussions only becoming apparent as the game progressed (in particular, the rule requiring you to have a certain amount of presence in a region before drawing cards wasn’t factored in until it was too late). Simple & accessible rules disguise a pretty meaty development game. Echoes of older games (Goa, Taj Mahal, Puerto Rico) but Endeavor also feels different. All the bits were a little larger than I’d expected - in a nice way. Keen to try again soon.

Second play: quite different. Two players with one game under their belt, two newbies. Less exploration, more attacking. I was always behind on buildings & population, so limited actions. I scored only 2 points from city occupation.

RATING: 8
Game with many possible routes that is fairly interesting game mechanics wise (how everything ties together).

The only problems I have with it, is that I wish there was more diversity in what you can do (it is all about controlling those spots, and I wish there was an option outside of that conflict). Also, I don't like the all open aspect. I wish there was some randomness or hidden information to spice it up. But I could see all of these things in a possible expansion, which would greatly increase my rating.

I might change rating after a few more plays, but right now it is between a 7.75 and an 8.

EDIT: After playing it again I feel it is a solid 8. An expansion pack would be awesome and would really help the game out -- as I think there is something missing. Not sure what but something feels off... there needs to be some other way to victory besides the obvious diversification or whatever.

EDIT 2: Very good game that is very tight the entire time. Captures the feel of a Civilization game but in a very short time. I still wish there was some kind of expansion that added some more depth to the game, like hidden cards or a more "technology"-like aspect, but it is still great.

Area control exercise with a colonial theme and no luck. Players have to increase their power to build, populate, pay and politicise, and a balance has to be struck as this needs to be done relatively evenly. Buildings allow players to perform certain actions such as shipping to particular areas of the board, settling territories or conducting military attacks to displace an opponent from a territory. Victory points are awarded for how far along the various status tracks a player has progressed and for how many areas they have settled. There is a slightly abstract aspect to the game but it incorporates its theme very well.

Played 1+ times.  Neat no-luck game of exploration.  The individual player boards are a little Goa/Industrial waste like in that you are improving  your position in a number of categories and each category gives a different ability.  The board play isn't that similar to a game I've played.  You place workers to control forts or help open a new area of forts.  Each fort is worth 1 point at the end of the game.  Every worker you place also gives you a token good for an advance in one of your player board categories.  
At the end of the game you get points for the level you've reached in each category, your forts and for connections to adjacent forts, and some bonus points for buildings constructed and cards drawn. **UPDATE** plays very quickly which is a plus. 2010/04/08

Not really understood the first time through this obvious candidate for another go round. Reminds me of Puerto Rico with those buildings which turns me off as a theme because I dont see building an opera house as necessary for the future of Spain and it's too clunky for an abstract.

First play tonight.  Originally, I browsed through the rules and didn't quite "get" it, so put it aside.  This is months later and by luck (we flipped coins) it beat out Cyclades and Dungeon Lords and hit the table.

Man, am I glad it did!!  This game was very fun and both players (3-player game) enjoyed it greatly as well.  The game doesn't scale with more/fewer players, so we barely managed to break into the new areas (outside Europe).  It didn't happen until the final/7th round.  I actually think this ended up being perfect, as once you get to the 6th/7th round, you have a lot of actions to use anyways...so sifting through cards and/or shipping into the other areas goes fast!  I suspect a 5-player game might have more gunfire (ie cannon use) than we had.

Overall, an awesome game!

A very nice game, with easy to learn rules and relatively short play time due to the fixed 7-rounds duration. As with a lot of "euro" games, this one has nice game mechanics and forces you to ressource management - but as with a lot of "euro" games, player interaction with "take that!" moments is quite limited.

I thought this was pretty good, I liked it enough I would actively seek to play it again in the future.  It is a Euro, but it has a little bit of combat built into it which makes it interesting enough.  I think there are multiple paths to victory, but not sure without more plays.

Nagyon kellemes kis játék, ami tényleg nem túl bonyolult, de azért elég sokmindenre oda kell figyelni. Nagyon szépek a játékelemek is, kellemes élmény volt játszani vele.

A fejlődési sávok miatt a Goára hasonlít. Nincs benne aukciós rész, cserébe van egy többségi mechanizmus a kormányzó (Governor) kártyák megszerzésénél. Van még benne egy tábla is, amin a városok elfoglalásáért jár pont. Atekintetben is a Goára hasonlít, hogy a fejlesztéseket a győzelmi pontokkal együtt lehet beszerzni.

No meg aztán ott vannak az épületek, és a karikákba helyezhető emberkék. Ez persze Puerto Rico-ra emlékeztet, de itt is van egy kellemes kis csavar: az emberkéket vissza kell szerezni, hogy újra használhassuk.

Mindent egybevetve szépen összerakott kis játék. Ugyan ismert mechanizmusok vannak benne elegyítve, de azért minden mechanizmus meg van tekerve annyira, hogy újszerű és érdekes legyen. Végeredményben eléggé különbözik mindegyik ötletadó játéktól ahhoz, hogy érdemes legyen azok mellé (is) beszerezni.

Mindenkinek csak ajánlani tudom.

Vaguely like Goa, you up various tracks to give you more power. You claim various connection bonuses for immediate rewards and final victory points. The game has some designed in "awkwardness" in that settling is useless in mid game and shipping in end game--not a feature I like. The random set up of the game has more effect than I expected on play. This is definitely a game where belligerent players can make the game into a mere popularity (or innocence-feigning) contest. With seven phases, no chance of even turns.

More plays are needed to determine whether this game really has anything to recommend itself over other economic games, but I think not.

Setup is a bit of a hassle, and, thematically, Endeavor is a snooze. If you can get past the cliched, almost lazy theme, the game is actually tight and well done. There is a limited number of turns, and each choice therefore feels quite meaningful.

Endeavor is a fun "growth" game, in which you start off with very little, and quickly build up your abilities.  It has a bit of an abstract feel, as players try to collect symbols to improve their stats, but the theming of shipping and politics etc. get a little lost.

RATING: 8
This has some elements of Puerto Rico (occupying buildings), Taj Mahal (picking up bonus tiles while placing influence on the board and making connections) and Goa (chits that give you extra actions and increase your abilities on your own development board/tracks). While it has borrowed mechanics from a lot of sources, it has its own unique feel. Endeavor also has an awful lot going on. Players have tons of options, many possible paths to victory to pursue and difficult decisions to make (especially when building - the most important choice a player will make each round). There's always more you want to do than resources allow, so each action is crucial. There's plenty of depth here, but experienced players should be able to knock back a four-player game in under an hour, which is a nice bang for the time invested. My one small quibble is the attack action creates a get-the-leader dynamic in the game, which can really hose a player (especially if other players incorrectly assess who is actually the leader). Endeavor also is a game, like Puerto Rico, where inexperienced players can give the game away to another player by "setting them up" for a big turn too often. With players of roughly the same experience level, however, Endeavor is a tense, challenging game that plays quickly despite the depth it offers.

Played twice with 4 players. Played one rule wrong (did not notice that one could ship to a region with a full shipping track), but that didn't affect the game too much. The first game was a little rough as most of the players didn't realize the importance of shipping, so quickly fell behind and it was tough to recover. That first game didn't have much colonization as many provinces weren't even close to having full shipping lanes. The second game was completely different as all shipping lanes filled up and the board was 85% filled. Doing well at this game is a fine-balancing act as one must improve all four status tracks to advance. Beautiful components, a fully functional game system, and a good bang-for-the-buck game. Looking forward to trying this with 5 as the confrontation should get even cutthroat. The only downside to this game is that there is no way to defend against an attack; one must prepare themselves to be attacked and not grow too attached to one's occupations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Endeavor looks more shallow--and more abstract--than it is.  Treasures are acquired via colonization and conquest, buildings are built and staffed, victory points are scored in a multitude of ways, and an organized player mat documents increasing capability across four tracks.  Endeavor delivers a lot of meat in just seven rounds.

I've seen someone mention it before and unfortunately it turned out just like it: this game allows for situations in which you are taken out of the game early on and can't do anything about it. For the rest of the game you will then be able to exist along the other players without any chance of really getting your economic engine started. 

The gamebreaker: While attacking someone is painful for the attacker, it is also very lucrative and it's backbreakingly painful for the one who is being attacked, especially early on in the game. It's even more annoying as the attacker chooses arbitrarily in the beginning who to attack. You cannot see at that point  who's good in the game or not. And you can do nothing to prevent it. 

I see some nice ideas in the game, which is probably why this game receives so many BGG praises. However I am astonished by this games's rating overall. One of my coplayers witnessed the very same problems in his one session he played the game before. And the problem is not solved by a learning curve. You can be experienced all you want. If two people choose to attack you in round 2, that's it.  

Maybe the game was so cutthroat because we were 5 players. The only way I see me giving this game one more chance is with 3 players. Cause knowing in round 2 that there will be no way of coming back into the game however hard you try is just sitting the game out for the remaining 1 1/2 hours. The finals scores showed that I just happened instead of playing. 

54-52-45-42-32

And also I fail to see what the many different strategies are supposed to be for this game. I'd make a bet if you don't settle in Europe at the start of the game and instead try to aim for a long-term strategy it won't work. 

Highly overrated, overhyped.

This has become the go-to game in our house lately.  It has a decent amount of strategy, plays different each time, and tends to be close in scoring.  It does have a bit of that same feeling of Kingsburg, where all players have the same basic building options, and, even though the there are many choices, the game can be played in the same basic way every time.  

However, because of the highly fiddly and prolonged nature of the random set-up, the way the game is played has to be adjusted from game to game, if even only slightly.  It can have that "want to play it again" feel, as it is fairly easy to teach, can be grasped quickly, and can be over in a snap.

A fairly simple game. The mechanics are intuitive after a few rounds. Their relation to the theme, however, is nearly non-existant, making this more an abstract game.

Lack of a scoring track may be problematic given the attack options.  It seems strange to have a person make a choice about a 4-6 point swing with a particular opponent without knowing who the most likely target should be.  That the outcome of the game may very well depend on these kind of "random" choices seems disappointing considering the thought put into the rest of the game.
 
Then again, perhaps it's just meant to be a lighter game.  One seems to have little control over the shipping majorities considering that minority players can play a significant role in who has the opportunity to trigger the Governor award.  In any case, I'm up for giving it one more shot, but if it still fails to impress, there are many other games I'd rather play.

This would normally be the type of game I would like. I guess my biggest problem with it was that, in addition to not capturing the theme very well and the mishmash of mechanics, was that there was simply too much going on for each player "behind the scenes." I wouldn't like to think anyone was intentionally cheating, but I'm pretty certain that players didn't understand the rules very well and mistakes were being made. It just wasn't a very fun experience.

Played twice at the Z-Man stall at Cancon/AGE 2009. Starts off slowly and ends with a bang. Artwork and components are top notch, gameplay is fast and the seven rounds swing by surprisingly quickly. Abolishing slavery is a killer. Shipping is your friend.

**UPDATE** 

A friend of mine picked this up in a recent math trade, so I've had a chance to play on a regular basis. The subtle strategy is this game is a delight. Timing the right building with the opening of a shipping lane is crucial. There are a couple of great two player variants on BGG and even a solo variant that ensure this can be played with any number of players.

Much has already been written about this first published design of Carl de Visser and Jarratt Gray, and whatever else anyone thinks of this game, it would be hard to argue with the fact that this is a very impressive first published design for any designer. It's a fairly complex German-style board game with a number of interlocking systems that take elements from many popular earlier designs (such as Puerto Rico and Goa) and repurposes them into a new package that works. The mechanics all work very well together which in and of itself is very impressive. It's also not a game that I can really adequately judge after just two plays and I need to play a few more times, but after those two games I'm not sure it's a game for me. My issue with the game, which I previously discussed in my Essen 2009: GeekBuzz Meets Fairplay article, is that it is yet another in a long line of games that give players the opportunity to specialize, but discourage and effectively prevent such specialization by rewarding a generalist approach that does a bit of everything. Like Agricola, Endeavor is a game that allows you to score points in a variety of categories and determines the ultimate result by adding up your points in each of these possible categories. However, you can't really specialize and pick a unique path to follow as you attempt to get as many points as possible because the way in which the technology advancement works seems to prevent such specialization. I tend to prefer games where I can actually take the game up on its offer of specialization (such as Age of Empires 3 and Container), rather than being corralled into the same generic approach as everyone else.

Played for years that you couldn't see what you were getting when you took a token from the board. Rated it 6 for being asinine. Replaying it with correct rules (so it is luckless) it's a bit better.

Basically this is a bottleneck/efficiency euro where drafting an improvement (to your economy) involves placing a disc of your color on a specific region on the map. Some regions/spaces need to get drafted before others (so sometimes you don't want to take something because a later player will get something great), and some pairs of spaces are connected so that the first person controlling both gets an extra improvement.

Moves are small in effect. You want to prioritize and time the improvements you take so that you'll have leveled something up when it next pays out.

The game is kind of a snowball, where you spend more than half of the turns doing very little, and then in the last couple of turns do quite a bit more, and then the game is over. A little strange.

I still don't like the scoring much. Scores are not quick to count up and are usually very close. There are a couple of things where I don't understand why you get points for them (labor you were unable to use, and a bonus for sucking so much that you didn't have a Governor card to store on the free space you get for one).

On the whole, a pretty painless game that would probably be irritating if it were much longer. I do like the idea of tying the drafting of economic improvements to spaces on a map. But I wish the map were more important.

A tightly integrated system, with interesting decisions and a crowded board, allowing different routes for success. Plays very quickly for what it does. Cool.

The attacks feel strange, since they're purely favoring one opponent over the other; when the game is close at the end, you wonder how much the choice of attackee affected that. But on the other hand, if you know who can attack, and you put yourself in a position desirable for the potential attacker, you're almost asking for it.

A game of world exploration and empire building. You represent a European empire colonizing the Mediterranean and shipping to all parts of the world to increase the empire's glory and status in Industry, Culture, Finance and Politics. When a region opens up (i.e. the shipping lanes are full) a player can colonize, attack or retrieve resources from that region. The game plays easily as each turn a player builds a building giving him a special action or increasing one of his main statistics, and gets a number of people with which to activate buildings for special actions (Ship, Occupy, Attack, Draw or Pay). Increased skill in Politics allow the player to hold cards that help increase his statistics and glory.

Although the game does not appear too chaotic at first glance, it is in practice. This is because actions generally have small effects for everyone and large effects for just some players. So, it happens too often that someone takes an action for the small effect that ends up seriously hurting you (since you were counting on taking it for the large effect) entirely by accident. Damaging other players' plans on purpose is one thing, but who wants to play a game of accidental screw jobs?

I am not terribly impressed with the game. I really dislike the very slow start and the snowballing effect in the last three rounds. In fact the game consists mainly of the final few rounds to determine the winner. While the game feels like it gives you choices, I suspect that one must advance relatively uniformly in the different tracks to get the maximum outcome. Choices toward the end of the games feels rather limited and you are sometimes forced to take actions that are not really useful (swapping cards to prevent others from taking them). There is nothing new mechanic wise. As it stands, I am not buying the hype in this game.

080311: Played again with four. A much better experience than with 5, but still not terribly impressed with the game. The slow and sluggish start coupled with the lack of choices at the beginning of the game makes for low re playability. I particularly dislike the building options for the game. An early rush for bricks and upgrades in buildings seem inevitable, although the end scores were close, signifying that this may not be a dominant strategy. While the strategies are subtle and I appreciate the nuances of shipping and allowing opponents to open up regions for colonization, I don't see myself holding on to this game much.

In my one play it struck me as just OK and a little dry, a middling combination of good parts from some other games. The slavery mechanic was interesting but didn't feel fully fleshed out. It sat on my shelf for a year after that, not getting played. Ultimately sold while culling my collection.

I was prepared to dislike the game because of its slavery mechanic, but I really like how every choice in the game matters and how you have the ability to adapt your strategy on the fly based on an available market card (which are really powerful) or how others are opening up a particular region. Though again, maybe this was just due to really good gaming partners and limited plays at the con...

Edit: Played it a few more times since then, and I still feel like if I'm going to play/recommend a two hour classic euro feel, it'd be this one.

RATING: 8
A solid game about the age of european expansion.  The mechanics might be a little tough to explain to newcomers, but things start to make sense pretty fast.  Downtime is acceptable as there is always a lot to think about.  The only issues that came to mind on first play are that the links between territories are a little hard to see at a glance, and the absence of any kind of naval combat was disappointing, but maybe that's just the wargamer talking.  The game will remain interesting for several plays at least, as the first few games will be spent mastering short term tactical decisions, with the big picture becoming clearer as you go along.

the only random element is the initial setup, which is viewable by all-  excellent mix of strategy and tactics, direct and indirect interaction, along with interesting and constant decisions, all in 45 minutes to an hour.  This hits all the right buttons for me, and makes me want to play it MORE every time I play it.

Excellent euro game, in the vein of Puerto Rico but different enough, more variability in setup but still a no-randomness game which I like a lot.

[+] perfect information game, fast paced, rather short game (only 7 turns), multiple paths to victory, multiple sources of interactions: race for governor, area/route control, a bit of fighting, many things to manage/optimize.
[-] no adjustments depending of number of players, might run into small issues in 3p/5p. 4p seems to be perfect.

One play, three player, and not thrilled, but not as uninspired as I was afraid I'd be.  Don't think it's very good as a three player game, probably needs four and maybe even all five to open up the exploration.  It's very short, about the maximum amount of time I can tolerate a pure Euro these days.  I like the interaction between the different ways of building up your empire, particularly how the exploration opens up the new areas.  I am worried that there can be some serious player order issues, particularly if people allow others to get the governor card.

I'm surprised to see "meh" reactions, I think this game is great, my favourite of 2009. Easy to learn, simple to play (no rules checking for the entire game the first few times you play), gorgeous artwork, and a really nice depth to playing time ratio.

Scales nicely, I've played a 5 player game on the Play by Forum, and 2 player games with the "official" variant. The variant is very good, really gave a feel quite similar to the 5 player game I played.

(9/09) After one 4p game - It is an enjoyable Euro game that might have gotten a little extra hype from GenCon.  Solid game play, interesting choices - what track do I research/build on, where should I ship, do I do a card draw, what is my hand size, can I be governor, extra points for "links", will slavery be abolished?

There are a lot of ways to score and the game is new enough that the subtle ways to gain an advantage are not super obvious so you can explore a different strategy.  There is the potential for AP - so maybe a "turn clock" is in order.  I can see future games getting done in 90 minutes with people who have played before and make decisions rather quickly.

Want to play again.

RATING: N/A
Resource collection and some drafting (buildings, cards). Minor direct interaction via wars (that can occasionally be annoying and lead to kingmaking), but mostly it is area majority.

Very fast first turns (when you have just an action or two), while later ones can be quite longer (and with more options, since areas of the boards get "unlocked" during the game). Overall, the length feels right and the decisions not trivial.

Deterministic gameplay, but random setup to offer greater replay value.

Theme is inexistent.

Nice game in its genre (optimization of actions, building an economic engine, scoring VPs to win), albeit it lacks a "soul" (i.e. some good reason to play it rather than the other hundreds of similar - and in some cases better - games).

This felt like the same sort of game as Goa and Puerto Rico - an average Euro with worker placement elements.

I think that with 4 or 5 players the game may very well by more dynamic.

To be so much more of all the same things you've seen in a Euro before (colonizing, shipping, wooden discs, VPs, and whatnot), this game really manages to distill out all of the sameness and make itself into something much more than the sum of its parts.  It's hard to really explain what makes the game so appealing, but it's turns are simple to understand, intuitive to play, and the interaction is high.  In addition, it's a perfect information game, so your decisions are meaningful, and has a lot of replay value due to its random setup each game.  I don't think it's for everyone (if you're not going to start battling each other for possession of territories, then the game won't reach its potential), but for me, it's very enjoyable.

The mechanisms are sound, and on paper, the game should work. But in practice, there's a little something missing -- maybe it's the rich-get-richer problem, or the "penultimate" syndrome (you don't want to perform the next-to-last action in a certain area, because then you open the door for somebody else to walk in and take the "end bonus").
I don't see myself playing this many more times. I'm already ticked off after two games.

Colonial exploration and colonization of Southern Hemisphere in the Atlantic. Building phase, action phase to place workers in your buildings or colonize areas. Develop ship trade, get contracts, develop politics. This game even incorporates slavery and abolition.  I don't mind learning from and remembering our past. In fact that is very important to me as a society. Good for them. Just a little too historically complete for our desired game experience.

One of the first 'middle-weight' games (okay, light-to-middleweight!) I understood after just one play. Pretty dour brown graphics make the board difficult to digest at first, but felt like a great game nonetheless.

Should be classed as a gateway game, as once you understand how the simple VP tracks, cards and connecting routes (from europe to all corners of the globe) work together, you're off.

Een spel dat in zijn relatief korte speelduur toch erg veel strategie en tactiek in zich heeft.

Alle spelers trekken de wijde wereld in om de wereld te koloniseren. Het spel verloopt in een vast patroon. Men is altijd verplicht één gebouw te bouwen iedere ronde. Hierna maakt men gebruik van zijn haar gebouwen naar gelang men genoeg bevolking heeft.

Dit spel is het absoluut waard om vaker gespeeld te worden, na de potjes die ik gespeeld heb, is er zeker nog niet één strategie echt uitgesprongen.

I like the theme, and is (by fluke) a design very similar to one I was working one (at the same time as it turns out).  It is funny how things like this happen sometimes.

I probably would have never done anything with my game so I am glad to see this one come out, but my design is different enough that maybe I will retheme it someday...

This is a marvelous game.  Because of the building and shipping, there are obvious comparisons to Puerto Rico, which is high praise right there.  This game also has no luck at all, as nothing is hidden.  Endeavor is a fairly heavy game, strategy-wise, but the mechanics can be easily learned by experienced gamers.  The one problem is that this is just another building/shipping game that really doesn't have much of a personality.  But the mechanics are darn near perfect and I would always play it because of that.

This game seems like it has a lot more going on and should take much longer to play but it's a nice little Euro package. I like how the decks are set up and the game has a built-in timer in the building phase. I'm not crazy about the random token setup as it's tough to get certain tracks going that you need early if the tokens aren't on the cities when you can only occupy. I guess you can specialize more by drawing from the decks since certain areas are better at certain tracks. The buildings are a bit generic too.

The 2-player variant works pretty well but I have a feeling this game is really for 4-5. I'm hoping 3-player is a little better with an actual brain and strategy controlling the third player. The problem I had is that the neutral player ended up screwing me more than it helped me or blocked my opponent. What I thought was a clever play would open up a port or block my own connections. Drawing seemed to be the worst, since most of the time there were only a few open ports with neutral presence so I'd be forced to discard a 2 and give the opponent access to the better 3.

Sold. Tough to get 4-5 for this and the 2-player wasn't really what I hoped for.

has some distasteful aspects that are similar to Puerto Rico, in that mixing experience players with inexperienced players, lessens the quality of the play to such a degree that it nearly ruins the game.  it has some good qualities, in that there are moderately interesting decisions to be made, and it is mercifully short.

This game packs a lot of strategy in a short amount of time.  It is a game where building a balanced empire is critical.  Sure you can invest in a heavy industry, but with out finance and population to use the high end buildings your empire is doomed.

Have played the 2p variant and with multiple players.  It plays quickly - I played two 3p games with rules explanation, set-up and clean-up in under two hours.

The game is playable with two, but much more fun with more.  I think the game is optimum with four and a 2p variant where each player controls two colors would be an excellent variant. Of course the Knizia rule (highest low score wins) would need to be in effect.

A solid, nice looking Euro game.  The setup of all the chits is a bit of a pain... but the game flows really nicely when you get going.  The expensive combat is only the most obvious player interaction as there is a lot of thought over the order to take cards and when to use the shipping lanes.  The automatic buildings were a nice touch and it will take a few more plays for me to figure out how to plan for them better.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Endeavor features an extremely streamlined gameplay that makes each round fairly quick to resolve.  The area majority aspect of the shipping track as well as the ability to attack add a small dose of interaction to an otherwise solitaire affair.  My only concern for the game itself is the technology tracks.  Since all four are evaluated at the same time for every players, one is almost expected to develop each equally with very little variation.  Which to me kind of goes against what a technology tree is for.  It should allow different paths to victory depending on my choices, but not so in Endeavor.  It's apparent that if you want to do well, you can't just devote your resources to one or two tracks.  As a result the player boards will look very similar at the end for those with scores that are close to each other.

Furthermore, even though the trade tokens are randomized, the buildings and the asset cards remain the same.  Therefore, I imagine the replayability will suffer.  There are just not enough different strategies to choose from.

I think Endeavor is a game that gives really good first impression, but will eventually fail to please as you get more familiar with it.  I'm going to have to try it again to see if it's the case.

I really like this game, but it doesn't play terribly well with 3.  This is definitely a 4-5 player game.

Yet another euro about shipping.  Pretty fun, but not overwhelmingly so.

Nagyon érdekes euró, mely első ránézésre ijesztőnek hatott, de aztán a játék felétől rá lehetett érezni. Ettől függetlenül egyáltalán nem játszottam jól, van miben fejlődni benne. Tetszett, sztem fogok még próbálkozni vele.

After 5+ Plays: It all works together smoothly, but where's the fun?  Feels a bit repetitious while playing, and even more so on subsequent plays because it tends to play out the same way each time.

RATING: 6
Very fun game. The only downsides are that it can drag on in the last two turns, and if you don't get the premise of the game, you will make some very foolish errors that will cost you more than you would think.

Very balanced, maibe to much. Quite impossible to know who's the winner until the end. In two games first, second and third at one VP distance...

Slavery for the win! Good rather abstract game about colonization, civ building and area control. Only one play so far but this one was exciting and felt refreshing.

Very nice. Similar to goa a bit.

RATING: 7
A solid design that falters in the flavor department, as there's simply very little there to captivate the creative mind and help you get lost in its world. The mechanics really are excellent, though, and the clarity with which the game comes across can't be faulted, even at the expense of prettier pictures or a more robust theme.

Very good strategic game which is faster, than you might expect due to 7 rounds. It's also for 5 players! We really do like this game in our board game club in Czech republic.

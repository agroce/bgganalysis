Played a 4p game. I kind of liked it, although not everybody in my group enjoyed it. I think it's fun, relatively quick and leaves you enough options to encourage thinking. I can imagine it's the best with 4 players, since there are more opportunities for the thief to score. Admittedly other than the thief there's little interaction and everybody just tries to draft cards most suitable for themselves. I'll stick to it for a while.

Bah (see what I did there?)

No, but seriously. This is casual filler fare. The sheep components are cute, but the game is inconsequential.

RATING: 3
Very disappointing. The initial stages of card review selection and passing around works well. However the placement rules seem wrong as they allow disconnected roads and rivers to run into town roads. The thief mechanism just doesn't work. The ample sheepdogs allow sheep to be moved out of their way and the fact that you can choose where the thieves go means that we never had a sheep stolen and they posed no threat or tension to the game. As a house rule we thought that either, the player who played the card should decide the direction and all other players had to copy, or the card layer actively moved everyones thieves where ever he wanted. The points gained for the town connections seem out of balance with the points for sheep and rivers. Overall, it seems to have lacked any proper playtesting.

Shocker... Another drafting game from Japan!  This one is pretty neat as it has a spacial aspect.  I hate the paper mats, but the rest of the components work well (the mini cotton balls as sheep!).  A filler I am looking forward to playing more!

Clever little drafting game that works well with 2. There is the constant threat of the thief cards that steal your sheep, and quite some tension regarding this aspect but also the cramped space that gives you very limited options. Extremely cute and with some nice decisions at times. OK fun for 2-4.

+ Very cute and unusual components
+ Easy to explain theme
+ Good introduction to drafting
+ Works well with 2-4 players
+ Small footprint

= Has a bit of sheep stealing interaction

- The playmats should have been card stock

Compare with SHEAR PANIC and SHEEPLAND
Breed some sheep, and watch them prosper, but watch out for those shifty sheep thieves. Players can play sheep cards to add sheep to the board, or play the sheepdog card to herd the sheep into their pens. Once they are in the pens they are safe. If a thief card is played the thieves will move, if the encounter a sheep they will steal the sheep.

Players draft landscape cards and then take turns playing them into their board. Cards with sheep cause a wooden sheep to be placed on the board, dogs allow you to move sheep towards barns where they are safe, foxes let you move the fox on everyone's board in the same direction, roads and rivers are just there. If a fox captures a sheep on any player's board, you collect it. Points are given for most sheep, longest river and connecting some points on the board with a road. A decent game but nothing really outstanding here. The game feels very solitaire until the fox starts moving but then can lead to players using it to gang up on a single player. I would play it if a group brought it out but won't be seeking it out.

RATING: 6
Essentially this is a tile laying game similar to something like Don Quixote but with card drafting.   The art is cute and there is some variability in the goals.   A very familiar and straight-forward game which plays quickly.  Not sure that there is much to mine here in terms of strategy or replayability.

Draft Cards which are laid down like Carcassonne tiles to form a landscape of sheep in fields, roads and rivers.  The sheep are cute balls of cotton.  For that alone this is a delight to play.   It all appears fairly relaxing and simple but you can steal each other’s sheep as well as send other players useless cards through the draft, so there is quite a bit to work with here.  

My only criticism is the paper board which isn’t ideal for holding the cards.  But given the alternative would have been a big box to hold the boards then I’ll live with it.

Nice game.

A cute, light tile-drafting game. It's no 7 Wonders or Carcassonne, the godparents that immediately come to mind, but a pleasant family-level filler. The minimalist Japanese presentation is part of the appeal, I suppose.

Don't really understand the purpose of the thieves. Keeping them away from your sheep is pretty trivial when you can decide where they move.  And since most points come from connecting to the town and completing rivers, sheep points aren't that important anyway.  Pretty light and simple, cute components, but not much game here.

RATING: 7
New edition is much larger than I prefer and has wooden sheeples instead of the woolly puffballs. However, it is nice to have thicker player boards and have a few changes in development made with barns and such. I would recommend that if goals are used, use one and make it a common goal for everyone or it is not a well balanced module (credit to Jonathan C. for this modification). 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was a cute game that involved a bit of Carcassonne and drafting cards to place on your map.  A thief was also present that could steal your sheep if you weren't careful.  Fun, but card distribution is likely better with more players.  The sheep were cute puffballs!

Very quick to play, so I am willing to try again to see whether this really works. Based on the first try, the card placement rules don't feel right to me, and the fox feels very strong. And since the cards are already sucky due to their configuration and the placement rules, not removing the fifth card from the game does not feel right either.

The Pegasus edition has very good component quality, even though I prefer the artwork and sheep of the original edition.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I bought Sheep and Thief to play with my 7yo daughter, but she's not a fan. She found the rules confusing and has struggled to fully grasp the game on her own. As a frame of reference she can play Lanterns on her own. I've found that the game isn't challenging or fun enough to break out when I am looking to play lighter fare. 

Sheep and Thief is a very basic drafting/tile laying game that doesn't offer many meaningful decisions. A lot of the game comes down to luck of the draw as you wait to get the card that will let you continue a road you are building as you try and connect to other cities. Stealing sheep via the fox, while fun, often isn't a very profitable move when compared to other actions you can take. I also really, really don't like the artwork in the new Pegasus Spiele edition; my girls thought the animals looked weird as well. 

In the end my kids and I all found Sheep and Thief to be a very forgettable experience and after three plays we don't have any desire to play again.[/i]

RATING: 6.7
Simple card collecting, tile laying game with beautifully drawn characters, including sheep, dogs and foxes. All with various actions that influence the outcome. I can't believe I haven't noticed this gem before. I'm certain this will see many many plays.
A drafting mechanism allows you to generate a route with cards but this is very restricted with the size of the player boards. The paths only cover four spaces and can only be completed three different ways. This makes for quite a tough challenge for kids and sometimes there has to be a little flexibility with the card placement otherwise the little ones don't score many points.
This game can be quite a lot of fun once the sheep,dogs and the wolf play their roles.
we found that simplifying the game initially and working each character in was a great way for kids to understand the purpose of the game. Also pick a simple route to begin with.A lot of fun, a challenge for younger kids , beautifully produced and quick to play.
Adding the Black Sheep Variant makes the game more interesting alongside a bonus challenge aswell.Remember to share the gold with the other players if you fail to complete the task.

19-10-2015. Rated after 5 plays. Sheep & Thief is a cute drafting/tile-placing game. The game is played over 3 drafting rounds.

In the game you try to get sheep, score points by connecting rivers and connect your home to cities. You score VPs. Thiefs destroy sheep and move on all player boards on the same way. Gives nice interactions.

Like it.

Small tile placement like Kingdomino but with tile drafting instead of bidding, and interaction between players boards (your foxes steal their sheep).

Really enjoy Sheep & Thief as a quick to play, accessible drafting game that can be enjoyed by the whole family. And the cute artwork contributes to its appeal. In fact, I enjoyed my first play of it so much that I copied the paper boards in order to laminate them and sleeved all the cards. I am confident that the game will see a lot of table table whenever we have half an hour to spare on a game night. More than other light drafting games, like Sushi Go for example, this game makes you sigh with relief everytime you succeed in connecting the cities on the board or bringing your sheep to safety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This felt a bit similar to Carcassonne with the idea of building pathways and waterways, but you were a lot more limited with card placement because of the size of your board and the card drafting aspect.  I initially thought the idea of placing sheep and herding them with the sheepdogs was interesting, but in the end none of us (in a 4P game) were ever in a situation where the thieves stole the sheep anyway.

The nice thing about this game is that it's compact, easy to learn, and quick to play. The down side is that the components are quite cheap; I'm worried about how long the paper player boards will last, and the "fluffy sheep" puff balls roll around if the boards aren't perfectly level. It's also lighter than I generally prefer, though that will probably make it good for teaching to new gamers.

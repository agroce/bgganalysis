A very nice tile-based majority game for 2.  It is just deep enough for me to really enjoy.  Very nice design.  I'll be finding my own copy.

RATING: 6
It seemed fun in the beginning, but an overall experience that made me think I will only play it one more time. IT is not that bad, you just get the whole nine yards in the first game. Fast learning curve it does not leave anything for the next games. Rated 6 after 2 plays, I am willing to try one more time to give it a chance to impress me.

Theme is just pasted on; it could really be anything and not make a bit of difference. Apart from that, game is mechanically simple but offers a decent level of strategy as you try to line up tiles and place works in an attempt to get the jump on your opponent and steal away valuable points. Interesting 2-player-only game but just not something we played enough so it got traded away.

Played a game, not a fan of area influence games. Did not enjoy it I am afraid, although I can see many nice design decisions. Perhaps if the tile placement was even more limited and specific, it would be an even better game. Area control fans may like it.

RATING: 6
This is a hybrid between Carcassonne and El Grande, but for only 2 players.
The mechanics are simple and streamlined, and although the game has some fiddlyness (the moving of the tiles on the tiles display, the removal of two rows of tiles after scoring), everthing is quite straightforward.
The luck factor can be decisive, especially when placing new order tiles.
In the end, it is a little interesting game to play with the GF when she wants some more conflict and nastyness than usual.

It's a tile laying 2 player euro - so more direct competition than you'd see in a multiplayer euro, but still a euro.

Theme is paper thin, mechanics are nothing particularly new, although the 'trash the first 2 lines' after scoring means you want to place deeper is a twist.

This isn't a game you can just play out without much thought, you need to consider your moves each turn, but it is tactical, you can't really have a strategy (other than score more points than your opponent).

I just got bored halfway through and had no desire to finish it. My opponent seemed equally underwelmed and was happy to accept my resignation.

Doubt I'll ever play this again, 2 player 'carc' I'd rather play the Castle, and much rather play H&G or The City.

RATING: 8
playtesting one of two versions of the game. Interesting 30 min/2player game, tile laying + area control with some twist

[edit] not so light and random I previously thought 7->7.5
[edit2] I played the game at many stages of development and I have seen how it was improving... now it is suprisingly heavy, quite "fierce" 2-players game - one of my favourite of this kind. Low luck factor. Lots of decisions (and calculations). Exceptional. incomparable to similar titles.
7.5 -> 8
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Akin to Carcassonne where you claim areas and those areas score points based on tiles.  This is more mechanics than theme.  It plays well enough with some thought going on in the order and selection of tiles to activate the vault or the order side.  I think I would rather play Carcassonne though.

This is a brilliant two-player game. The rules are simple but there are a lot of choices to be made during the game. It is fairly confrontational.

RATING: 6
Mean two player tile-layer with area majority scoring. Cut-throat competition from start to finish, really has a "knife fight in a phone-booth" feel to it. Presentation is a little irritating at first (the iconography of the orders is not quite intuitive), but the game flows smoothly from there.

I'm rating this 6.5 after the first game.
It has a good chance of both beeing played again and get a better rating judged by how grumpy my wife was after the game....

I really like that what you build affects which actions will be left on the bord for your opponent. Sometimes you need to build something useless (or even counterproductive) just to hinder your opponent to do something.

Damage controll is something I like in games.

I don't like that you can only manipulate your own workers, and not your opponents.

A destructive element is something I like in games.

In fact, next time we play we will let the actions be done to ANY worker.
(Or pawns. I think they are called pawns in this game, even though they are clearly working.)

This might or might not become the very first houserule in this house.

I've played this before so not clear why I didn't rate or comment before. It's a good, solid, visual game with nice choices and easy sums. There are a lot of action symbols which leads to some fiddliness, but experienced gamers will not find it hard. The graphics are well done, and it all flows nicely.

Shame it's a tad boring. I found it relatively easy to calculate optimal moves, and it came down to making sure you did things in the right order. It was fun, and I'll play again, but it didn't really get me going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good strategy game with a lot to consider, and hard decisions.  

There are some simple mechanics that add to the game--for one, I like the removal of the first two rows after scoring.  I also think being able to see the next tile that will come to the board really increases the strategy.  I like the mechanic of flipping tiles in the top row to the bottom, but at the same time that increases the luck a bit more than I like.  I also like the fact there are only two coins in the game, so I found myself often trying to entice my opponent to take an action and pay me for a move--which is another strategy and hard decision in the game.

Superficially, the box top is very eye-catchy.  Unfortunately for me the colors are garishly unpleasant, but certainly distinguish area control easily.  It was also disappointing, considering the cost, that the all-important builders that the game centers around, are just your standard, small brown cubes. Each player has only 5--surely they could have done better--they weren't even the basic meeples.

The game was easily punched--nothing tore or had ragged edges.

It is a good 2-player game, but it probably won't hit the table again with my husband who hated it--probably because the score was 90 to 0.  In fairness, all the juicy tiles came up for me at the right time.  Heavy on strategy, heavy on luck as well.

RATING: 7.3
Carcassonne-hoz hasonló lapkalerakós játék. Egy bazilikát épít két (a király kegyeiért) versengő építész. A bazilikában különböző színű termeket kell a lapkák segítségével kialakítani, és a termekben erőfölényt szerezni a bábuk (munkások, építészek) segítségével. A játék sava-borsát a akciólapok adják, melyek segítségével, amolyan kitolós carcassonne-ná válik a játék. :) Érdekes a lapok felhúzási mechanizmusa is, mivel ugyanazt a lapot fel lehet terem építésre és akció kijátszásra is használni.
A kivitelezés egyszerű, de szép és jó minőségű. 
Az új ára teljesen irreális, mivel egy árban kéne lennie a carcassonne-nal (a komponensek alapján).
Nagyon jó, gondolkodós, kétszemélyes játék, ami kevesebb, mint egy óra alatt lezavarható.

I had no idea if I would like it or not, even though I saw atleast one video review of it. Now, having played the game, I'm somewhat impressed. Sure, it plays and looks alot like a abstract game, but that doesn't make it any worse. 

There are so many options and possible plays and yet it's not deterministic, as there is some luck involved, just enough to open the game.

Only downside (which may differ with other persons) was the time it took. If played in 45 minutes, it's just great, but not so, if it takes double that amount.

Either way, great stuff.

Decent two player tile game with more depth than is initially apparent. Fairly simple rules, the only downside was trying to remember what the actions did, which i'm sure will not be a problem when we have a few playthroughs under our belt.

I thought this was an excellent two player game, one I’m glad to have in my collection.  The game is a real brain burner for such a simple game.  The game played in about an hour, and it was taxing mentally which I enjoy.  Provides a tense "if I do this, she’ll do this" type of feeling.  Packs a nice strategic punch in less than an hour. Very nice...rating could go up.

Szerintem ez egy kimondottan jó kétfős absztrakt játék, olyan, amiben játékról-játékra fejlődni lehet, és bár persze van benne véletlenszerűség, hogy hogy jönnek egymás után a lapkák, elég jól tervezhető. Igen konfrontatív, bár egy többségi birtoklású játék milyen legyen. :) Szóval nagyon tetszik, kár, hogy Anettnek meg nem annyira jött be.

An interesting 2 player game with quite a bit of planning involved. It has enough variety and control to keep it interesting without it being too predetermined to make it dull. There is an element of luck in the play as you do not get to see the tiles you will be leaving your opponent except the first one when it is too late to do anything anyway. The area control aspect of the game has enough twists in it to ensure that nothing is ever guaranteed whilst still making it awkward to make a take-over. Nicely balanced but thematically lacking and probably too many random elements for abstract purists to enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a solid tile laying game involving area majority and special powers.  However, this is only a two player game which means this is a very direct, confrontational game where conflict is ever present and required.  Playing nice will usually not work out so well.  The limited number of workers also limit your ability to claim areas.  Enjoyed this game, but I do think I prefer other two player games more - I tend to be more peaceful minded and direct conflict wears me down after time...and playing this after A Few Acres of Snow didn't help!  :-)

A potentially good game, ruined for me by bad design choices. The yellow and green colors are pretty similar, but the individual tiles have distinctive patterns making them a cinch to tell apart. There are combo tiles, however, and they decided to omit the distinguishing marks from these, meaning I had a really hard time telling which was which. I played about half a game until the headache of trying to figure out the colors won out and we packed the game in. I didn't see enough there to warrant buying a copy and marking it up so I could play, though.

RATING: 5
There's only one thing worse than a done-to-death theme, and that's sticking it on a bland abstract affair like this. You're not building a cathedral, you're placing tiles to build areas in each colour, and then placing builders on those tiles to win them area-majority style. Oh, and do three scorings to add another hackneyed Euro area-majority trope. There are some clever things to do each turn in terms of using special actions to clear out areas, boost areas, re-shape areas, and the like that can make a significant change to the upcoming scoring. But in another sense, taking the time to work out the best use of these available powers just makes the game longer. Which it really doesn't need to be.

An area control game that feels a bit like trying to win cities in Carcassonne.  But a game where it is more prudent to cut one's losses rather than try to win a large area at all costs.  The investment to do so bypasses the other scoring chances on the table.  Open tile displays means that the effect of one's move on the game state for the next move is known.  Nice 2P game with a good decision space.

This game is every bit as confrontational as other commenters have suggested.

Staggeringly dry, but an interesting premise that seems to work quite well. The game is essentially an area majority with some nice, difficult choices as to how best to try and score.

Good 2-player game. 

Abstract tile laying game with area majority and some opportunities to screw your opponent over with clever use of actions.

I hate the theme! "build a medieval cathedral..." is like a joke phrase I use to describe the most boring and over used theme of all times.

Nice tactical area majority game for two players. Can be quite a thinker at times. Lots of opportunities for creative play. Components are excellent quality and very functional with well thought out design.

Really enjoying this after 4 plays.  I don't get to play a lot of two-player games, but this currently has a place among the A-list titles in my collection that only support two.

Beautiful Euro with lots of direct attacks and conflict under the hood. Slightly fiddly upkeep as you mix building sections of roof with executing nasty orders to try and control the largest coloured regions.

Score will go up if I can find a way to make this game appeal to folks I want to play with more.

a more gamer-y carcassonne style game for only 2 players.  the tile churn mechanic was ok, but otherwise not a lot new here.  if i REALLY liked 2-player cutthroat carc, i would have liked this more, but when i bust out carc, it's not really with cutthroat players.

Δύο αρχιτέκτονες χτίζουν μαζί ένα μεγαλοπρεπή καθεδρικό ναό, αλλά μόνο αυτός που θα τοποθετήσει καλύτερα τους χτίστες του και θα χρησιμοποιήσει πιο έξυπνα τις εντολές του θα πάρει τη δόξα.

Excellent 2-player game with tough choices.  Quick playing time is a bonus.  Will play different each time.

No fireworks. Will play it from time to time, but there's nothing especially exciting about it.

Playtested a prototype. Nice tile laying game with some neat mechanics and a lot of interaction between players.

Pretty cutthroat tile-laying game which looks very innocent but really isn't. I like the ideas at play here, though I wish the package as a whole did not feel so abstract. Still, a worthwhile game.

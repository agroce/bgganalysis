All aboard the hype train! Ding ding! No, but seriously. 

In short, not only is this possibly the most engaging, interesting puzzle a co-op game has ever presented, but the asymmetry and complexity ushers players towards acting as individuals towards a common goal, rather than the 'hive mind acting as one' approach often taken (which I don't care for) 

On top of that, the theme is wonderful and deftly tied to the mechanics. And variability is through the roof. And it plays great solo.

Rating based on a strong first impression - subject to change but likely to remain at least this high. I'm hooked.

edit: Have now played it with a couple groups. 9 still feels right for me, however a couple of caveats: 
- initial plays can run quite long, as people get to grips with the mechanics and having so many options. Not egregiously so, though; just had a 3 hour 4p game, which seems fine to me for a first run. 
- it's certainly a medium-heavy game and the fact it's a co-op might not help gamers who usually shy away from games of this weight.
- some people practically ask to be micro-managed in this game, which can be tedious!

Pre-ordered from Origins so received base game and Branch and Claw expansion. So far have played twice - two players and four players. We love it. The theme and gameplay are so unique. I love the unique card powers and innate powers of each spirit and the multiple decisions one must make each round - which growth options to choose, which cards to play, how much energy to use or save, and ultimately which lands to target. Strong theme. Very strategic and tactical. And so much more to explore with different spirits, adversaries, scenarios, and the expansion which adds more to every aspect of the game.

10/12/17 - Now my favorite game. Will play, suggest playing, and will always enjoy. I prefer teaching this game with 2-3 players and find that as a 2-player game, it is actually a shockingly effective gateway game. By 'gateway game', I mean a game that actually makes a person who may have played a light board game or two get actually interested in board gaming as a hobby. It's a great solo game, it's a perfect 2-player, it's a super-exciting 3-player, and a brutally challenging 4-player (although with experienced players, an absolute blast). The endless difficulty levels provide ridiculous replayability and despite the game being as deep and heavy as they come, the rules are actually not all that complex. It's the strategy that's difficult.  

09/22/17 - After more plays, I am upgrading the rating of this game to a well-deserved 10. This game is the heaviest co-op I own, not because of the rules (the rules are in fact fairly straightforward), but because of the difficulty of the game itself and the sort of collaboration involved. I introduced this game to a friend whose heaviest game played, until that point, had been Smash Up and who claimed to hate long board games. And yet, she loved this extremely heavy 3+ hour game and immediately wanted to play again. It has been impossible to predict whether a given person will have a hard or an easy time playing this one. A player who plays games like Lisboa and Gallerist had trouble, although most heavy gamers do play quite well. This game rewards successful collaboration and an intuitive sense of synergies between powers and spirits. There is no downtime, no time when you are not actively involved in the game. As a result, this is quite possibly the quickest-feeling 3+ hour game that I have ever played. What makes this game a true 10 is the ability to endlessly modify the difficulty with invaders, scenarios, beasts, spirits, alternate maps, etc. This takes the game to a whole new level of replayability that none of my other co-op games can match. I am looking forward to trying the expansion and to getting to play with the more challenging spirits. 

08/28/17 - First play rating. Very different co-op experience.  Each spirit plays very differently and even playing the game on its easiest possible mode, it was challenging. I'm looking forward to trying out all the spirits, adding in scenarios, specific invaders, and so forth. This is definitely a game with extremely high replayability. Possible future 10, although I worry that I might have difficulty getting it to the table very often because of its complexity. Love the dynamic of the game: spirits start out very limited, but become extremely powerful toward the end of the game, just as the invaders start advancing more rapidly. I've ordered the expansion, but I suspect it will be a while before I am actually ready to play it.

Spirit Island is a heavy cooperative game with an uncommon theme: you are spirits and protect your island against settlers. It is a good mix between strategic and tactical decision-making. Thinking about your next step is a big part of the game, it is quite puzzly. Most coop games (e.g., Pandemic, The Captain Is Dead) suffer from alpha leader problems, where an experience player tells others players what to do (it depends on the game group). Due to the sheer amount of decisions, the game makes it very hard for someone who wants to be the alpha leader. Moreover, the game offers a lot of different configuration and thus replayability.

Really enjoyed this one, although it will take more plays to really understand what went on and why our plays happened to work out.

We did win, but it felt enjoyably tense until the final few rounds and I don't think we had a good handle on WHY we were winning (but we kept doing things that kinda made sense).

There's a lot of potential for combos and great plays, although tabletalk and coordination is absolutely critical.

As others have commented, Spirit Island is kind of the Anti-Catan.  The game system throws rapacious plastic settlers at the unspoiled paradise of the wooden mushroom people.  We, the island's spirits must repell them with elemental powers, violence and plain old fear.  For me the theme is twice as fun with those settlers imagined as efficiency gamers bent on gathering resources, building buildings and gaining prestige with some distant prince. Bastards.

The spirits are nicely asymmetric.  The key to the game is collectively learning how they can work together most effectively. Part of that collective learning is about the power cards we each hold; which had best be played in combination with which others this turn and in what sequence.  Protracted collective discussion of this has the potential to slow the game to a crawl.  The rule allowing any player to set a time limit on this phase feels like the designers ducking their responsibility for making their game work.  My suggestion is to agree a house rule at the start.  

Spirit Island has a nice arc to it.  Early on it feels like one of those coops like Ghost Stories that just keeps flinging more and more at you.  However, as the game progresses, your spirits grow increasingly powerful.  Play well and, just as you are staring defeat in the face, there will be a tipping point at which your ability to lay waste to the invaders will exceed their reinforcements.  And you can make that arc steeper with plenty of available tweaks to the difficulty level.  Serious fun.

Production quality is mostly very good.  My one gripe is with the frail plastic settler figures.  The artwork is vivid and functional.

It's been awhile since I've been this taken with a co-op (non legacy). I like the complexity (which reduces alpha player syndrome). I also like the way evil advances - you know a bit and can plan, but there is definitely some surprises as well. Very solid want to play again.

Amazing cooperative game with a lot of replayability.One of the games,that has done me very nervous,because it is very difficult game.It has a lot of power cards and characters,that activate their effect depending on the range and target area and make it more interest. I recommend it to people who are looking huge challenge.

This is everything I want from a co-op.  Enough complexity to ward off one person from taking over the game, and also enough to keep each player's interest.  I've watched this game be refined over time, and it's been slowly polished into a gem.  Should be one of the top hits of 2017.

My groups fav game of GenCon '17.   Smart, hard-but-fair coop that really requires a strategic group effort to...complete.  (Winning might be a nice bonus.)  Thematic help make the games rules make sense as do intuitive individual player boards.   Looks great on the table and is a heck of a lot of fun.

Spirit Island is another solo game experience for me.  I generally play 1 or 2 spirits at a time.  My one complaint is that it is very difficult to play with others on a "one off" basis (i.e. not suitable for a meetup group, IMO).  Spirit Island is a game you need to explore and become familiar with to really enjoy.

This game is very much "It's good if you like it".  If you want a cooperative game that is complex and flavorful, then this game will give you hours and hours of unique content.  If you want something simple and easy to teach then this game is not for you.

Updated Review: Played a few more games adding adversary and really enjoy the variety that is given.  I'm excited to also try the other blight cards, other scenarios, It has been a pretty big hit with the group and everyone is looking to "try more spirits, find more combos, and explore the additional nuances in the game. I feel like I've barely scratched the surface with the massive amount of content.  

One recurring comment in the group has been - it feels like Gloomhaven where people discuss high level decisions on how to tackle X/Y/Z problem, but it is up to the individual to determine how to specifically implement that action.  The teamwork feels good but there isn't an alpha gamer problem in the slightest (similar to Gloomhaven).  

The artwork in the game is stunning and I always hear "the spirits feel so thematic and it feels like I'm one of them".  We recently played the Ocean one and the whole tide going in/out was very nice and

A great co op game with awesome components and beautiful art. A very thinky game with a lot of tough decisions. 

The one downside I picked up from my first game is this can be very prone to AP for first time players. Even with more experienced players I can see that this game gets bogged down in mathing out the best moves. 

Still enjoyed my play though just isn't something Im going to seek out all the time.

First impressions (solo plays):
Solo is very good, each game was a nice puzzle which is hard but not unsolvable. The spirits feel very different in gameplay and all of the ones were fun to play (that I tried).

The folding board doesn't lay flat and some of the components (like the fear markers and turn effect markers or what) are not on a par with the rest of the game stuff.

Difficulity is very adjustable.

Initial Impression: For the price that this game commands, I was a bit disappointed by the mixed-bag quality of some of the components in the box. The cardboard and artwork were definitely top notch but I found that the minis felt small and flimsy. I almost wonder if it would simply have been better to include wooden components and/or standees. The cardstock for the cards also felt a little weak. That aside, the gameplay is where this game shines. I'm a sucker for asymmetrical player powers and this game has it in spades. Although we won our first game, I can see how coordination and communication is crucial to surviving in this thematic cooperative game. The AI is simple and predictable, which allows the players to plan up to 2 turns ahead. This game presents a brutal puzzle where one wrong move may cost the players the victory. With so many spirits, powers, and scenarios to choose from I can imagine that this game will be extremely replayable.

This game was way more brain burning than I expected even though I feed on heavy games, headache while playing my first game. Luck element is minimal which I like and the spirits playstyle really felt different from one another. Replayability is pretty insane, so many spirits and also countries and scenarios to mix and match the difficulty level. This game is no joke, the easiest level is HARD to win and there's so many levels to customize, up to level 18 I think. I love how quarterback issue is solved with this game and genuinely felt like a co-op game, you're too busy managing your own spirits to dictate what others should do. Game length is a bit too long for my liking though but I'm sure it'll improve with repeated plays. Teaching this game is tough, something I don't look forward to. Need more plays before I can really decide how I feel about the game.

RATING: 9
This is easily the best (non-legacy) cooperative game I've played. It's got an excellent, unique theme of protecting an island and it's native inhabitants from the scourges of foreign colonists. The art and components are both A+ but the gameplay is where it's at. The way you affect the board is through playing power cards and using your spirit's special abilities. Figuring out which cards to play, where to place presence tokens, how to combo with other spirits, which new cards to add to your hand...it's a wonderful wonderful puzzle to solve. The luck-level is surprisingly low for such a heavy coop which is awesome. It also scales amazingly well from 1 to 4 although be warned that each new player/spirit that gets added will significantly increase the depth. There is so much to explore in this box with the various spirits, scenarios, adversaries, etc that I don't see my rating going down and could be a Top 10 game for me.

RATING: 9
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite co-op games and my initial score of 9 may go up the more that I am able to explore the variety in the game. 
In Spirit Island, players take on the roll of island spirits who use their special powers to protect the natives and try everything they can to get rid of foreign invaders. Players will do this by expanding presence on the board and playing power cards, all of which are unique and thematic. Every spirit you can be is completely different from the next, and the game has loads of customization, even without the expansion (which I plan on getting). 

There is a lot to think about during the planning phase which can lead to some AP, but the breadth of options you have to try to ward off the invaders is surprising, and the games always feel tense and close. Also, the amount of quarterbacking in this game is naturally limited, due to the fact that it's hard to really focus too much on any board other than your own. Also, it seems to scale very simply and well. I'm really liking this game so far and look forward to playing it more. Easily my favorite co-op of 2017.

Here are 5 reasons why I adore this game after a 4p game, a couple of 2p games, and a handful of solo games


1) The rules are very easy to understand. All  players understood what was happening on the map, and what needed to be done (not that we could always do anything about it). But the steps of the game were all easily understood by each player, and my ability to answer questions about the game required no need for the rulebook for the most part.

2) The difficulty is great. I'm usually a glutton from punishment from my coop games. Faves being Robinson Crusoe, Ghost Stories, etc. Spirit Island in its introductory mode is quite difficult but beatable. This is the first time I have played what is considered to be a difficult game, beat it the first time around (4P), and wanted to come back for more. I will investigate increasing the difficulty moving forward. And this leads me into point #3)

3) The complexity of the game feeds my euro loving hunger to a great degree. What other players have mentioned is true. The complexity of the game defeats the quarterbacking issue that most coop games have. At one point, my friend turned to me and ask me “What should I do here....hey Ryan....what should I do here”. I literally could not assist him quickly because I was so engrossed in my own abilities. Best puzzle of a coop game I have played.

4) The asymmetry of the spirits is simply amazing. Possibly the best and most unique amount of asymmetry I have seen in a game like this. This lends itself so well to the strategy of the game. I was using the “Shadows flicker in Flame” spirit in our 4p game and realized early that I was not going to be able to deal with all the invaders populating my board. But I could push fear like crazy. So the focus of the group was to assist on my island when possible/needed, while I generate a lot of fear and move that engine along. Fantastic coop balance or really needing to ask for and provide help.

5) Power cards are outstanding. As I mentioned, in our 4p game we used the progression decks for the four intro spirits. This was great at teaching us the flow of the game and the importance of both types of power cards. But in the preceeding 2p game I played, we went with the draw 4 pick 1 rule. This was very engaging as we were looking for cards with the right action we needed, but it also had us hunting for specific symbols to maximize out innate powers. Can’t say enough about the power cards and the combos you can come up with.


Perfect game for me.

RATING: 8.5
[After 7 plays] Impressive design, which surface I just barely scratched.

What for me is main strength of this game, that after play or two, rule-set feels only slightly more complicated than Pandemic, yet it brings far more strategic and meaningful decisions.
This strategic depth is probably caused by your actions having long lasting consequences, even (or sometimes especially) in early stages of game.
The city that you allowed to be build might become a thorn in your side later, that choice of increasing your card play instead of energy will limit you strongly, that cheap power you selected early might actually doom you, that other power you used and discarded was crucial for next turn.

Because early decisions have strong impact later, you usually need to look few turns ahead and consider you options carefully. Also you never feel that you were defeated unfairly by pure randomness, you usually could track your failure to some specific choice, which always calls for "you can do better next time".

Difficulty is expertly balanced, each invader level feels impossible to beat until you actually try it, and no victory is easy, there are always hard parts that you need to push through.

Spirits are quite different and each provide different challenge, but thankfully they don't feel shoehorned into specific strategy - a lot of their "character" is defined by selection of random powers acquired during play, and even "low complexity" spirits could be tricky and not-so-straightforward.

"Spirit Island" offers a lot of variability out of the box, plays great solo and in greater number, requires a lot of brainstorming and teamwork in multiplayer games, and you don't feel hours that pass by.

Exceptional. Provides an intense, engaging, and engrossing gaming experience, and is probably the deepest (and heaviest) cooperative game I've ever played. Over the course of the game, the tension and difficulty ratchets up as the board gets more crowded, but your characters power up so much that you begin to have truly spectacular turns by the end of the game. The card combos are extremely satisfying, especially if you can pull them off between players.

Theme and concept are amazing, art and presentation are top-notch, and an impressive amount of thoughtful detail went into the rules and player boards. Difficulty level is high, but not impossible. The game is quite long, though: the Growth phase alone can take 5-10 minutes as players try to work out their turns together. The upside is that the game is extremely cooperative: you really have to be flexible to work with and around the powers of the other players. One of the best games of 2017  so far; this might just edge out Gloomhaven for Game of the Year for me.

first 2p play was good. it is indeed a smart concept, a co-op where the game gets tougher in a sense (or rather there are more things to do), but you also get more abilities. also, the first game (or more as I understand), are easier such that you can sense the difficulty but yet still "win". the various spirits and powers are interesting and I will be intrigued enough one day to buy it for myself I believe.

Probably one of the best cooperative games I have ever played. It's sort of like Mage Knight meets Pandemic. The amount of replay value in this is just insane. All the different spirits and there powers just flow so good in this game. Such a well produced and designed game.

This is a complicated game, no doubt about that. But it also presents challenges that are immensely fun to overcome as a result of providing numerous routes to success.

It also manages cooperative play in what I consider to be the most fun way: everyone makes their own choices, but collaborating is highly encouraged. It makes it a lot less likely that a single player will dominate the decision-making process for the whole group.

Extremely engaging!   If your play group enjoys complex interactions between players in order to play out a common strategy, this is the game for you!  Even my wife enjoys this one.  

Definitely play with the "First-Time Players" setting on your first go so you can (hopefully) get a win out of your first play through.

A completely unique game. I haven't played anything to compare it to which makes it an interesting game to "review." I'm giving it a 9 currently after multiple plays a night for a while now. The theme of the game is quite nice in my opinion so there's no fault there. What really gets me is that the game at its core is basically a puzzle you have to solve. I love puzzles. Especially ones that get harder as the game progresses. 

The spirits play drastically different, the different scenarios and difficulty create a ton of replay value, and the game art just looks wonderful. The ONLY complaint that I really have is that the components are...sub par quality. The little towns and explorers are nicely designed, but the quality of them is meh. Feels cheap. The cards feel just okay. The player boards were clearly the focus here which is good at least. 

If you enjoy a heavy, puzzle-y game that will demand your attention then this is a must own.

Fantastic deep game. Nice and beefy. Yet it has clear turn order. Very themey and pretty. Replay is great as it has 8 characters to choose from in a 4 player game. A coop that doesn't have a big fear of a gamehog telling everyone what to do. One of the better doom clock games and not unwinnable at all!

Cons:
- Lots to remember to do each phase. Phases are clearly structured, but all the extra things you may or may not have to do is not. Some structure or way to signal this besides having it written down as an extra rule would have been great.
- Difficult to git gud.

The main strategic depth of Spirit Island comes from the order of the phases. 
For example: 
- You get to see what area will get ravaged next. This puts pressure on certain places on the board and you deal with or mitigate them during the fast phase.
- You get to see what area will get built next. If you have the capability you can deal with this during the fast phase as well. If not, you still have a slow phase. 
- Your slow phase comes after the invaders so you have new information about the board state. You had planned to clear off one tile but now you need to react to what just happened during invader phase. 

Other Pros:
- Social interaction is encouraged. Each player usually starts off on their own board, but you expand to other boards quickly and help one another put out fires and cover for one another.
- You feel powerful. Every game feels hopeless, but sometimes you manage persevere, acquired new powers, kill some invaders and win. Feelsgoodman.

This seems like it would be a great solo game. One of the few where I may actually like the solo play more than multiplayer.

Edit- went ahead and got it. It's a great solo game- I love the puzzle of how to put out the various fires. It does feel a bit like you win just when you finally get your engine going though.

Pandemic with a more puzzling nature.  Comes with 8 characters and each has a unique deck and powers.  It is simple enough to understand it on your first play but complex enough that other player will have little idea on how to help you.  This is a major upgrade to many coops.  There is also a good amount of interaction and discussion in how to divide and fight out each round.

The only bad thing is that I preordered at Origins and when I put in the code they game me, the software on their web site told me I only payed 49 dollars and not the 79 I did pay and wanted me to pay more.  I contacted them and quick and helpful response.

RATING: 10
This was not a game I was immediately drawn to. I sat down at the table to play it simply to fill a spot for others who were playing. My initial concern was it looked like a bloated design that would be some convoluted mess of ideas. Oh how I was wrong...

The design of this game is exceptionally well thought out. I love how the designer is able to provide each player with interesting choices, enabling wonderful team playing opportunities even while giving each player ownership of their own turns. This game manages to capture that feeling I use to get playing mmorpg video games  when your group is engaged in some epic battle and each person manages to pull off their skills at just the right time to eek out a victory.

This game is also much weightier than I expected going into it, and it may strike some people as being a bit fiddly, but the publisher/designer has done a decent job at helping you through the moving parts. The variation of the Spirits is excellent and I wouldn't want it any other way, but like any asymmetric game, it does add to the learning curve. If you ask me, that's part of the fun here. Some abilities seem hohum until you realize your buddy across the table is able to build on your progress to terrifying effect. With fewer players, it's easier to coordinate and make the most of your turns, but with more players the complexities of making that perfect move grow exponentially. All a plus in my book.

This leads me to scalability. In theory, everyone is taking their turns simultaneously, so adding players won't add time. In practice, however, there is time added to the game based simply on their being more people with which to coordinate fun abilities. This puzzle grows more complex throughout the game as you gain more abilities and powers, which can cause quite a bit of AP (analysis paralysis). It's something you should be aware of, though I wouldn't let that put you off. If you like complexity in your games, it just comes with the territory. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys coop games with variety. I feel the levels of difficulty are well managed to provide any group with a challenge but also with the possibility of success. Win or lose, you'll be contemplating your choices for the next play of it long after you've packed it away.

Too much, just too much.  Too much planning, too many options, too much time, too many invaders, too much blight...

Honestly, this was very frustrating and stressful, trying to manage what is happening now and what is going to happen in the future, all with a limited supply of cards and actions.  At the end of our two-hour gameplay, we felt no closer to winning when we inevitably lost.  

Clearly we're missing something in the strategy, losing so quickly on the easiest level, but (i) the game was just not fun to manage, and (ii) it was not at all clear what we could have done better.

I don't mind complexity and planning, but I think it's better suited for a competitive game.  If things go wrong for me there, I don't mind losing.  But if things go wrong in a coop, because I couldn't plan well, then the game just becomes hopeless and not fun to play.

Love the theme and the varying spirit powers. Its pretty immersive and has good blurbs about each spirit on their player boards. Have only played a couple of the lower complexity spirits so far but and they both felt quite different.

Very replayable game. Has various layers of complexity and difficulty which can be escalated or de escalated to suit players. (not messed around to much with that yet but seams good on paper).

Have only played it solitaire a few times but can see this becoming  a favorite and does not seam massive complicated to teach so unlike some of my other games I wont be intimidated by prospect of suggesting a game.

Spirit Island is by far the best coop I've played, including Pandemic Legacy. 

We all have an innate enjoyment of justified violence. If we didn't the Mad Max franchise - not to mention about a third of all Hollywood films - wouldn't exist. Of all the big baddies in the world, pillaging, polluting colonists that leave a wake of blight in their path is the most real, the most present, and by far the most satisfying to tee the f*ck off on. Slaying dragons or zombies entirely pales in comparison to slaying a-holes.

Technically, Spirit Island is brilliant. It's a race, but one where you draw the finish line closer to you as you sprint for it: that's the strength of being a Spirit, a force of nature: you shift the land beneath the invaders' feet, you destroy what you can and terrorize the survivors. [i]Let them escape to their ships with tales of dread... "Set no foot on this accursed isle... here lie horrors beyond reckoning..."[/i]

If you succeed, peace and sustainability are restored to your island and it's native people. If you fail, well, fantasy begins to look more like reality... Make a donation to your favorite environmental cause, re-rack, and try once again to get it right on your little cardboard corner of the world.

So many interesting decisions. For me, I love all the complex interactions that the game makes possible, and the way it rewards detailed planning and coordination with the other players. This is paired with an awesome theme that fits well with the gameplay. There's enough going on that it's really hard for one player to alpha-game the group.

It plays well with 1-4 players in the games I've played. I personally like to play at the higher difficulty levels and plan things out; as a result, games take well longer than the stated times.

Spirit Island is a deep cooperative experience with absolutely massive variability.  

[b]Let's go over all the positive points:[/b]

-The theme is unique and refreshing: European colonists have invaded an island that inhabit the native Dahan tribe. They are taking up space in the land, using it for it's resources which blights the land. The players play as spirits of the island that will try to remove the colonists through fear and/or force.

-There is a fair degree of thematic integration: The lightning spirit is fast and destructive, the earth spirit is slow and tough, the water spirit push things from where they were originally located, the nightmare spirit causes no damage but extra fear, a volcanic power originates in a mountain region an is very destructive to its region and harmful to the nearby regions, and the list goes on and on.

-The artwork and graphic design is both functional and pleasing to the eye. The components are better than serviceable when you consider that each spirit has a cardboard map instead of a cardstock mat.

-There is massive variability to the game: there are 8 spirits in the base game and 2 promo spirits. Each Spirit has a very unique play style. Even if you played the same Spirit every game, you will get different powers from the major and minor power deck making you play the game with a different approach. The game includes 3 adversaries, which gives a unique feel to the automated AI. Each adversary has 7 unique levels of difficulty. There are scenarios included in the game, which can be be played on their own or combined with adversaries. If this wasn't enough, there is an expansion which adds new elements and increases the variability of all of the above. Oh, and there are 4 map boards which can be combined in a variety of ways as well as a unique canonical map on the reverse side of the map tiles.

-While there can be some difficult to interpret specific  interactions/powers in the game, the core rules of the game are very easy to understand. This is a deep and complex game, but doesn't have near the rules overhead of something like Mage Knight or Robinson Crusoe. If you are having issues with the game, the designer and developers are very active on the forums and regularly add to the living FAQ located [url=https://querki.net/u/darker/spirit-island-faq/#!.3y28a87]HERE[/url].

-A lot of attention to detail has gone into this game: Each level of the adversaries his an approximate difficulty listed and also a mention of what kind of spirits have a harder/easier time against them. The same is true of the scenarios. You can even score your game according to variables listed in the instruction manual. The spirits are rated based on the complexity to learn how to play the spirit well. There are also good ways to ease new players into the game (no blight card and a power acquisition list that compliments the introductory spirits).

-The alpha player problem seems drastically reduced due to the complexity of the game, as well as asymmetric spirits and unique power cards.

-Though, this is more of a preference, I have to list it under this game's strengths: I love the hand-building in this game (similar to games such as Concordia and Lewis & Clark) over games that integrate deck-building (i.e. Mage Knight, Blood Bowl Team Manager, and Orleans). There is a lot less randomness in this method of developing your capabilities. The picking up of cards is even more interesting in this game than games like Concordia because the frequency you do this really affects how your Spirit is developed over the course of the game.

[b]I don't really have many negatives to talk about, but I wouldn't be me, if I didn't nitpick a few things:[/b]

-I don't like unpainted miniatures. I would have preferred white meeples and white wooden buildings. I know I'm in a minority on this topic and the delineation of plastic as invaders and wooden as bystanders/spirits makes sense, but I can't help how I feel. 

-Regardless of complexity, some Spirits feel clearly superior over others. Imbalance of player powers is less of an issue in a cooperative game over a competitive, though. There also feels like an imbalance in the strength of the power cards (despite costs). Though, players pick between 4 rather than just blindly drawing off the top of the deck.

-In the solo game, there is a lot (almost too much) to keep track of when playing 2+ spirits and an adversary. You can play one spirit on a single tile, but you don't have interesting synergy between spirits and some spirits may be severely hampered without having another spirit in the game (i.e. Ocean's Hungry Grasp and Serpent Slumbering Beneath the Island).

-If a second expansion is eventually released, I will need another storage solution. The base game, promos, and 1st expansion fit in the base game box, but it's nearing capacity. With a second expansion, I'd likely need to a second box to store everything and I hate using more than one box to store a game. That said, Eric, please make this debacle a reality!!

[b]Conclusion/TLDR[/b]

If you couldn't tell, I absolutely love Spirit Island. In less than a month, I've played the game over 35 times, it has become my favorite cooperative game, and is now in my top 5 games of all time. It may even crack the top 3 in time. This gives me the feel of cooperative Mage Knight that's quicker, less random, and has much less rules overhead. I think the cooperative Mage Knight comparison is apt because players position themselves around the map, acquire cards, and puzzle how to use these cards to accomplish tasks and win the game. Both games have numerous scenarios to attempt and there are many ways to alter the difficulty.

If you like cooperative games, games with asymmetric powers, deeply strategic games, and games with massive replay value, I'd strongly suggest that you at least try Spirit Island.

I’m having trouble pinning this game down. It’s caught on like wildfire in the 1PG community, especially among Mage Knight fans but I’m merely tepid about it (I've played at all player counts so far). This game has been compared aptly to Mage Knight for how complex the card play is, and it is indeed very interesting.

First, you have both fast and slow power cards. The turn structure goes "fast player cards-then enemy phase-then slow player cards." So, you have to figure out how to use your fast and slow cards in ways that mitigate what the enemy plans to do. 

Then you have the way you acquire new cards. You may acquire minor or major power cards. Minor cards are simply new cards added to your hand of choices. Major cards are much more powerful but require you to “forget” (trash) a minor power. This is an ingenious mechanism that I suspect will be copied in other games for how simple yet fun it is. 

Lastly, the cards you play have symbols on them. If you play enough of the requisite symbols, you’ll trigger your innate powers for bonus effects each turn. In a Concordia-like way, you’ll have to take an action to reclaim the cards you’ve played on prior turns, so you not only have to figure out which cards to play now but what you’ll be left with on the next turn. Throw in the aspect that player powers really complement each other and the result is a wonderfully brain melting affair of figuring out how to play cards each turn.

That’s all wonderful stuff and truly inspired design IMO. And yet the experience somehow adds up to less than the sum of those parts. Given the choice, I’d much rather play Mage Knight over this anytime. MK is much more exciting and immersive in the experience. Perhaps it’s the tower defense fulcrum on which the game is built, but I just don’t get that same tingly sense of excitement when I play this game. There’s been a point in each of our games when we stemmed the tide of invaders coming and it was just a matter of time until we ground them down to satisfy the win condition.

Now, you could argue that we could up the difficulty and play with the adversaries, and I will give that a try. I also wonder if the expansion which offers events will spice things up. But my gut tells me that while I love the card play here, the tower defense aspect just doesn’t thrill me. It's too static with the result of all the mental churn not going on an adventure but rather staying put while adding and removing pieces. 

So, for now I like it but don't love it. Put this card system on some other game and it might be a MK killer for me.

Update: I paid a BGG market price of $90 for this game. For $90, I have to love a game. I only liked it so I sold my copy with the net effect of having rented it for a few dollars. Kinda bummed I'm not gaga for this the way some people are but I'm not. Maybe I'll reacquire next year when it hits retail at a reasonable price.

Truly unique theme and honestly it really married with some of the mechanics, i.e. the shadow spirit is very good at scaring the invaders away i.e moving them around the board,  the stone spirit is very defensive, river is live giving and healing and as such can remove blight etc etc. 

Its a bit fiddly to begin with and has quite a steep learning curve but once you get the flow of the game then it plays very well. Whilst you mostly concentrate on what YOU are doing you must also consider what the other spirits are able to achieve this turn and co-operate to deal with stubborn problems i.e cities.

I was expecting it to be reminiscent of pandemic but with a few tweaks and a clever theme but it is completely different and there is so much scope for replayability as there are so many little rule additions or tweaks to vary the challenge, you can add an empire to fight, or use random spirit powers, or mix up the spirits played or play a scenario or....or... or....so many options, it felt a little overwhelming at first.

For my tastes: Best solo game ever. And - no, I was not a Kickstarter backer. Excellent hybrid of Ameritrash and euros, right down to the components.

2017 AUG UPDATE: [b]Five plays in[/b] now and raising rating to a 10. Even at plain-Jane vanilla complexity, I find the cardplay of the asymmetrical spirits to be very interesting. Top-tier solo game for euro gamers and Ameritrashers?

Someone else said it well: the putting-out-fires nature of the Invaders is a bit derivative, but it is also a small part of the game - it's actually the choices in the cardplay that the tension and complexity come from (unlike, say, Pandemic where the board and infection deck get busier and more complex while player's decisions are of the same type). In Pandemic, the diseases start out simple and become sprawling and problematic; in Spirit Island, players start out weak and with little presence, then grow to be super-powerful in hopes of taking over the island. And the differences are what make Spirit Island uniquely great.

2017 AUG: [b]One play in[/b]: No lower than an 8, could rise to 10.

What I like: clever theme, simple "bot" to run, great variety is playable spirits (i.e. styles), plus a fair number of powers.

What I don't like: the bot in the into game is too straightfoward (but I assume this gets more interesting?), the art in the game lacks a unified style and consistent quality

I love everything about this game, and I feel like I've just scratched the surface.

I've played most of the base game spirits in combinations of 1P and 2P games and everything is so well designed and flows so we together.

I've beaten a few games and feel like I've got a grip on the flow of things.  Now, I need to start playing with adversaries and scenarios before moving on to the Claw and Branch expansion.

There's so much variability, replayability, and longevity here, but even the difficulty 1 base game is incredible.

I can't stop thinking about this game.

Hüha. Ez a játék nagyon-nagyon jól sikerült. nagyszerű téma, egyértelműen tematikára épített ám mégis tökéletesen működő mechanika. És végre megint egy coop játék, ami tud újat hozni. Az biztos, hogy ebbe belegebed az ember agya, pláne ha nyerni akar, ert nagyon sokat lehet és kell is optimalizálni az akciók egymásra hatásán, sorrendjén. Az újrajátszhatósága is frenetikus, a rengeteg faj miatt, amik ráadásul mind nagyon tematikusak, és nagyon nagyon más stratégiát igényelnek. Ennyi ömlengés után miért nem 10-es? Hát annak kéne lennie, de egyetlen hátránya, hogy már hármasban is sok lehet szerintem a holtidő annál több fővel meg neki se ülnék inkább. Kettesben viszont szipiszupi.

Interesting concept, playing the monstrous deities attempting to slaughter the colonists of an island, while you yourself don't really care about the natives.  There are a lot of interesting ideas mechanically here, but the game just doesn't work for me.

The real flaw for me is that in a game where so little is unknown (all players are on the same side, all take their actions together, and enemy actions are mostly telegraphed,) you can have a very slow game due to everyone just plotting and trying to optimize, and I just found that painfully slow and dull.  It might work much better solo.

I ended up getting it off Amazon. Components are top notch and I love the design of the plastic inserts. They are designed to fit everything nicely into the box. This looks fantastic. It has a lot of components.

After 2 plays:

What I like:
- Game makes me squirm with analysis paralysis. I don't know why I like that but I do (but only when playing solo)
- I love the components. Tiny little miniature invaders are neat. 
- I love a variables in the spirits and card draws.
- The rule book is pretty good. There's great references to what you need in an index at the back and lots of icons on the back page. I used it a lot for the first couple games.

What I did't like:
- The invader board was a bit warped at first and I had to flex it a bit to get it straightened out. Should be good now. 
- It's difficult for me to remember all the things I need to know about the rules, so I have to keep looking them up.
- I don't like that I didn't Kickstart this one, because I'd like to have those other spirits.

Two solo plays in, and I love it.  I loved it from the rulebook layout, the colours, and the art, even before I started playing.  The game itself, at least solitaire, is brutally, brutally hard.  It's also deliciously challenging to figure out, and I don't believe it's too hard.  For a game this good, it's shocking how little space a solitaire play of it takes up.  You could play this on a small elementary school desk!

Heavy. I sometimes look at my collection and think "I have nothing heavy enough." Now there is this. The first two hours we spent with this were the most enjoyable bewilderment.

Great game. Co-op but with less of the quarterbacking problems of most co-op games. Love the thematic touches. Each spirit behaves just like you'd expect them to based on their nature. Lots of customization to adjust the difficulty. Lots of play styles to choose from. Fairly complex and takes a while to play.

The theme caught my attention, the gameplay made me stay. Great co-operative game with straightforward rules, yet surprisingly multi-layered and engaging mechanics. The number of different spirits, powers, adversaries, and scenarios mean a lot of replayability, and highly varied situations that you simply cannot tackle on autopilot. The alpha player problem is very well controlled.

Finally a good euro-style coop! This game doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, but it comes together in a smart, engaging way. I like a lot of the mechanics: light engine building by spreading your influence, deterministic combat, asymmetric player powers, hand management and hand building; but the best part is that it's a coop with minimal and manageable randomness! The card flowing system means that you can always plan at least 2 turns ahead and still allows for an unpredictable enemy that will create a slightly different puzzle every time.

Most coop games break down after a few plays after you've "solved" the puzzle and I haven't played enough of this game to know if that will happen here too, but it's at least smart enough to include a bunch of different scenarios and difficulty levels and the playable characters are all so different so the game feels different depending on what spirit you're playing.

The difficulty is well balanced, the time and pacing seems just right. My one concern is with replayability, but so far in enjoying myself immensly.

I wish this game wasn't so complex. I wanted to like this more, but the abilities of each spirit card and the way they can stack and combo off of each other makes it especially difficult for a first time player to a) understand what they need to do on the board and b) which cards to play and in what order. I think this rating could raise significantly upon further plays and I'm willing to play it again for certain. But the complexity of this game exacerbated what I didn't like about coops in that we played the game for 3:15, but I felt like I was only "playing" the game for about 30 min.

RATING: 7
Promising, but I have a severe allergy to committee co-ops, which this skirts the edge of being. On paper there's nothing to stop it from becoming a committee game, but Eric has said that the experience design is meant to make it much easier for people to manage their own board closely and coordinate with people only in broader terms, rather than everybody agreeing about one another's play details.

In my one play it partially succeeded there, but I could feel the wall starting to crumble as we got comfortable with the rules. We'll see!

RATING: 6
Spirit Island is a co-operative game where each player is a spirit trying to keep colonists from colonizing the island. Spirit Island offers a quality version of the co-op standard tracks to victory, tracks to defeat, manage threats along the way model. It is a very complex game. With this there is some good and some bad. There are many more decisions and because of that, many more decisions that feel like "good" choices. Rarely did I run into situations where there is an obvious correct choice. This fosters positive discussions at the table about how to approach each situation. On the downside, this complexity brings with it a very long game and many situations where it is difficult to see the effect (positive or negative) of a decision. Sometimes what players do has a treadmill feel of working very hard to stay in one place. Also, the depth and complexity in each turn's order of phases is overly complicated. This creates depth, but is costly to being able to visualize the results of each decision. With most, this will be a sour first play. However, once tackled a handful of times, I can see this growing to be quite a good game. The co-op puzzles are solid, but over complicated at first.

Gold standard for co-op games. Really great fairly heavy co-op. Lots of game in the box. Requires planning and co-operation in order to win. It's both strategic and tactical. The different spirits play differently and each have a learning curve. The scenarios and adversaries add a lot of replayability. Each game usually has a really nice arc to it, with invaders rising in numbers at about the same rate as the spirits gain power. Good plays will change the balance of the game in your favour.

Haven't played yet, but I believe that this is going to become my top 3 co-op right away. Theme is super cool and unique, turning this old and traditional theme of island exploration and exploitation around and putting players in a role of a Spirit of the Island. Yes, this is a time for payback, payback for all those sins that colonists have committed. Now we are guardian spirits, whose duty along with some Island natives, is to protect the Island against the colonist threat (basically a white man). Eventually we are supposed to push them back to the sea. We will not allow them to rape and desecrate our sacred land of pure nature. These Spirits vary a lot: there's basically a Spirit for every different element, like Fire, Water, Earth etc. All these Spirits are also very different in game-play wise, they have different set of skills. Really, not only the theme is awesome but the game itself feels so different, in a good way, than most co-op's.

What a great game. Thematic, very asymmetric, clean, and gives a very satisfying amount of brain-burn coupled with the results of your hard-thinking being spectacularly satisfying. I have yet to move past the basic difficulty, still finding each game and each win feeling like I earned them despite (in hindsight) not particularly feeling like I was near to losing at any point so far, even though there is always one moment before you've built up steam with your spirit that the board state looks like you'll never be able to reverse the course. It makes it all the more satisfying when you right the ship and send the invaders fleeing.

This is a neat game!  This is a coop game with a somewhat Pandemic-like mechanism where European imperialist colonialists are infesting and spreading across your lush island.  You are native gods seeking to stamp out this growing pestilence.  You each have very distinct powers that you can bring to bear and power cards that you can play.  You have a certain amount of magic points that you can spend to play the cards each turn.  You spread your influence markers across the island that in turn allows you to bring your powers to bear on the colonialists.  Each turn your powers grow (more inflluence, more magic points, more power cards, you get to choose) but the colonialists grow more powerful too.  It's challenging even on the lower difficulty levels and there is so much to consider that no one player can dominate the coop play; everyone has their hands full just playing their own position.  Good theme and lots of interesting strategies and card combos.  There are a lot of powers that help other players.  You really need to communicate and cooperate to win.

I've been playing this one since its early beta-test days, and it's deliciously fun and replayable -- a co-op game with serious strategy and thought.

It has the characteristic of really great co-ops that you often feel like you are DoomedDoomedDoomed, but if everybody works together and fights smart you can beat back the invaders.  There aren't too many games that actually leave my heart pounding from the sheer tension of whether we're going to win or lose.

Played once. Steep learning curve, long game.  Lots going on.   If you have even a little bit of AP tendency, this will bring it out.   The game successfully avoids alpha-gamer issues, but (as many others have noted) it does this by giving each player such complex choices that they could not conceivably plan their turn and _also_ plan someone else's turn.   Hopefully will be more fun next time.

RATING: 9
I've read couple of reviews before getting this on my table, 
and I completely agree with that every player gets to make their own decision, but still cooperate/interact strong enough to achieve the goal. 

Spirits grow by having increased influence on the island which allows you to play more cards or gain more energy and eventually gains abilities by obtaining power cards. It is somewhat deck building, and because every spirit has different unique abilities and the game varies depending on how many players are involved, what spirits are involved, therefore there are so many tactics you can perform. There's definitely no solid tactic to win this game regardless of whatever combination you get in. 

The rules are somewhat look complex, but in terms of how we're trying to scare invaders off from their island as a spirit, it pretty intuitive. Takes a bit time for new player to get on board, but for those who love strategic game will be able to plan ahead from the second play.

Short words, great theme, love the dynamics, everyone enjoyed (4 players for our very first time) and high replayability. We did win by starting off what rulebook suggested, but looking forward to see how game shifts in different way with adversities and different spirits. 

Once you have fixed members of playing spirit island over multiple times, I think it's worthwhile to aim to clear within Fear Lv1 or Fear Lv2.

2017-10-23 - This is an interesting and pretty heavy cooperative game. It requires a ton of forward thinking and planing things out with the other players. It's actually, maybe a little too cooperative. The amount of coordination required means you almost need to know every card in your hand and every card in the other players' hands. I didn't dislike it, but it's not something I'm going to want to play very often.

Very early impressions:  Spirit Island impresses me. Maybe a lot.  Rating to follow after I've played more games with a variety of spirits and player counts.

Be aware that the weight rating on BGG is way off. It’s much simpler than say, The Great Zimbabwe or Food Chain Magnate, for example. Complaints of fiddlyness also confuse me. This isn’t Codenames or Onitama, but it also isn’t what I’d call a complicated game.

Update:  I'm still hot on Spirit Island, but our first four-player game was an unmitigated disaster.  The group was mixed between two players who had played before, and two new players.  That was a mistake.  Our group is made of very experienced gamers, and to be fair, no one had any issues with the rules.  That said, everything took way longer than it should have, even for a learning-ish game.

I now believe that Spirit Island is a bit like another favorite of mine, Argent.  There's a lot going on, and 2-3 players is the sweet spot, unless, maybe, all four players really know what they are doing.

initial impression, I much prefer this over Pandemic and other coops where the main puzzle is best solved by 1 player.  This feels more like Gloomhaven where each player is doing their own complicated thing with some opportunistic cooperation and planning.  There is a good amount of asymmetry here, and the amount of randomness in the AI is just about right.  I'm not sure yet if the gameplay is interesting enough to hold up after many plays though.

The presentation of the game is very dense; it felt very difficult to really get into the game. I'm usually more of a casual player and try to play games loose and fast. Despite what is written in the manual, I don't think it's possible to play this game without spending the time to analyze everything. Unfortunately, with the board clutter, it can be quite hard to evaluate every option without getting lost. I guess I would play this again, but only if an experienced person can take the charge and do a lot of the bookkeeping so I can focus on my character.

Not a bad co-operative game.  Has an interesting and unique theme of playing spirits or gods who are attempting to keep settlers from invading and settling on an  island.  Nice artwork on the cards.  This isn't typically my type of game i.e. using various powers to fight and deliver hit points to dudes or enemies on a map.  But it's interesting and I'd be willing to play this again if others wished.

I'm becoming wary of these "hotness" games which is making me more and more reluctant to play them. This co-op feels very "gamey". The cards were full of text, had to over-analyze what other players had. Have fun twiddling your thumbs as you spend loads of upkeep time with random event cards and waiting for other players to make their decisions. Overly worded, overly complicated, and convoluted which reminded me a lot of the same feelings I had for Too Many Bones another "hot" game that bored me to death. Spirit Island among many other new Kickstarters will eventually face the same fate of fading away. Spirit Island lacks game but provides a long, boring mess.

So much game here. It's meaty, but with relatively simple mechanics.  I love that it's relatively easy to teach but still very challenging and has a well defined way to ramp up difficulty if you so desire. It plays great solo, or with others, and there is so much to think about that, unlike some co-ops, you don't have to worry about anyone in the group trying to take over and tell everyone what they need to do.

with branch and claw expansion.  I don't know about this one.  It's very complex for a co-op.  The theme is great, but it needs multiple plays to shine.  For people who want a more streamlined co-op, Pandemic or Flash Point Fire Rescue does a better job.

Really great cooperative game without much of an alpha-player issue.  Hard to keep track of everyone else's powers so there is a real conversation around the table about how to approach each round.  Takes a bit of effort/time to get new players into the game or would play it more frequently.

I was excited when I first read the description about Spirit Island as I thought it was a truly unique theme by a company that I almost trust implicitly, which is a no brainer in my book. I was lucky enough to catch Christopher as he was sitting down to do a demo on the first day of GenCon and I must say that the game didn't disappoint at all. Christopher described it as a "reverse worker placement" but I really didn't see that at all in the gameplay. Its more like a cooperative area control game with special powers and fighting. I'm sure you have already read the description of Spirit Island and know that it is a game in which the players work together as spirits on island that must work together to drive off the evil colonialists. During gameplay I chose the spirit of Darkness which causes fear to spread easily in the cowardly colonists. Each spirit starts out with a number of inherent powers that they can immediately play, and during the game they will have the opportunity to add a number of other powers to their spirit which makes them more and more powerful. During the game the spirits also get help in the local population of the island who not only worship you, but also hate the colonists that are arriving. As I mentioned during my first game I was the spirit of fear, and later in the game I was able to acquire another major power that added lightening to my abilities which I envisioned as turning me into the Smoke Monster from LOST, and using this ability I was able to basically destroy a whole island space colonists. Shortly thereafter we (the spirits) won the game. This will definitely be a difficult cooperative game when it is released, and one that will definitely be a brain burner. It will also be fun as hell.
There were a couple of drawbacks in the one play I had of Spirit Island. I felt that the game has a couple of extraneous levels of complexity that I wish would be streamlined into the other mechanics of the game. Such as the innate powers, versus the powers you have in your starting cards. Then there are too many different types of pieces on the board. There are fear pieces, villager pieces, city pieces, settlement pieces, colonist pieces, beast pieces, curse pieces, and then spirit pieces. The board gets a little cluttered. 
Overall the game is definitely a strong contender, and will definitely be another home run for GtG. I just wish they would open the kickstarter and take my money already.

Our plays of this can get pretty long since we probably overthink most of our decisions. They do suggest a timer if this is a problem but it adds a bit too much stress for us. There are a lot of things to consider and keep track of and we will inevitably miss something but we just keep going and try to remember to play by the rules going forward. Really love this game but we need to make sure we block out enough time.

This game is so overrated. It just isn't that good or very fun. It gives the illusion of fun and engagement, but it feels like being on a conveyor belt that will inevitably dump you into the trash or you wise up and decide to jump off the belt.

It's appeal is perfect suited for middle-aged gamers who've played nothing more complicated than Catan-esque games; And burned themselves out on noob stuff. They then get off on the "take that" aspect of Spirit Island's theme. The game strategically fools them into thinking they are smarter than they are; that they are "eurogamers",and by beating a seemingly "complex" game, they gain a false sense of satisfaction. But it's all ultimately hollow. The game puzzle isn't more complex than a pandemic, but is complicated by meaningless actions and rules that could have easily been refined, which again lends to its facade of being "Euro".

This game is one of those things in life that acts as a benchmark of character quality. If someone "loves" this game, I already know too much about them,; more than I want or need to know. Much like people who love patchouli, Ed Hardy or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

RATING: 7
This is a tough call. I was eager to try this, as it sounded like a very different type of co-op in both theme and execution. And it's got a lot of great stuff going on. But the play felt flat.

Matt, who was teaching, had a few 2p games under his belt, but this was his first time playing 4p. And he wasn't really aware of how drastically the scale changes at 4. My wife and I, both newbs, were utterly overwhelmed, having no idea where to be or what to do and how to help.

Things got better in the second half as we figured things out, but by then the board state was hopeless and our positions weren't great. We were clearly fighting a losing battle.

That said, there really is something here. I love the anti-colonial theme, and I love touches like the spirits and natives being wood while the invaders are plastic. That's a great touch. The artwork is attractive and the gameplay is tense. It's definitely in the realm of the whack-a-mole co-ops such as Pandemic, but the way player actions are done really limits the alpha player problem. It's also pretty clear that things can unfold differently each game, even without using optional extra rules and scenarios.

My only problem seems to be the difficulty curve. I'm eager to try again with 2p, but 4p may just ramp things up too much unless you have a lot of experience with the game.

RATING: 8
One of the best coops that I have played. Much like Sentinels of the Multiverse, so much of your success relies on synergy with other players and the powers of their spirits. Also, like Sentinels, I love how different and asymmetrical the spirits are regarding their abilities and strategies for use.....also, like Sentinels, it can be a bit fiddly. However, I think that it feeds in to the complexity of the game, which is something I appreciate in a coop, given that most are pretty straight-forward. If you like coops that require a lot of cooperation and a bit of thought, try it!

Spirit Island is a complex cooperative game with awesome theme. I love the asymetrical aspect of the spirits and how they each have a unique thematic feel. You need to learn how to play each spirit for utilizing its strengths to its full potential. During the first few games, it's easy to loose track of certain aspects of the game or misplay some rules. The game shines with elements on power cards that activate special innate ability for the spirits, some very thematic design. The ability to custom the Spirit team, the different Invaders factions which all works in a unique way, scenarios adding even more flavors and the various difficulty levels is what makes some insane replayability!

Hands down one of my top 2 favourite cooperative board games. There are a lot of mechanics here but they all fit together so well like a completed puzzle. The stars are the spirits, their play styles and triggering their abilities and effects using energy and elements. Great integration of elements of area control and the board looks better in real life than in the pictures. Player's gain a true sense of cooperation where every player's voice is heard and needed in order to deal with the problems that the game throws at you.

Finally, a new game in my top 10. That's not to say there aren't downsides to Spirit Island, in fact there are quite a few, but it tackles a very unique theme in a very respectful manner (not shying away from the fact that Europeans were colonists but not overly villainizing them, protecting the natives but giving them agency so to not portray them as helpless savages), while being a very assymetrical co-op with seemingly at least decently balanced character choices. I love how each spirit plays realluydifferently, and that will probably give the game lots of replayabilty, yet you are not completely on rails since there is the handbuilding aspects of getting new powers.The different scenarios and factions which I have not tried yet should also add a lot of variability. 

Another thing great about this game is most thematic games sacrifice gameplay for the sake of their theme. Not so here. Between area influence of presence and where the invaders show up, needing synergizing powers, and timing of fast and slow actions there is a ton to think about.

As for the negatives, the invaders (maybe the adversaries changes this?) Are pretty abstract as they do the same basic thing every round which is especially noticeable when compared to the unique spirits, the game can be pretty puzzly which can make the ending anticlimactic and at least in its most basic setting once you figure it out it doesn't seem like you will lose very often afterwards, if you time something wrong (which isn't too hard to do with the fast vs. Slow powers and some that are conditionally fast or slow) it can have pretty big ramifications, there are some ambiguities about how special powers interact with the rules, and the inconsistent art style can clash at times. Therefore this game isn't for everyone and is a little rough around the edges, but it still executed a very ambitious project fairly well and is arguably one of the best  heavy thematic co-op euros out there.

Best with 2-3 spirits. One lacks synergy opportunities and 4 there is just too much coordination required of who should do what (which adds tactics but bogs the game down).

This game is shockingly heavy and thinky. It's the heaviest coop I have ever played, and really one of the heavier games I have played in a long time.

The beginner game sacrifices no core play at all. In fact, it allows new players to play the beginner game while others play "normally". It's a model for how any beginner play should work in more complex games.

The game is difficult and varied, and has great legs.

I love so many things about this game. The high variability with different levels of adversaries and combinations of spirits (or just individual spirits because they all play so differently). The theme is so fresh. The gameplay is engrossing, I just spent 3 hours playing a two-spirit solo game and didn't even realize it had been that long. This is the solo game I've been waiting for.

Generally, my favorite games tend to lean more tactics than strategy.  I like playing more by instinct and don't want to always have to math out / plan out future turns.  Likely caused by the fact that my job involves quite a bit of logistics and forward planning so I don't want to do it as much when I'm relaxing.  Of course, there are some exceptions - Spirit Island is one of them!  This game requires a lot of teamwork/coordination and forward planning.  It took me a few plays to really start to enjoy it, but once the game clicked (strategy-wise), I really enjoyed it.  You start to feel like a super powerful spirit as you pull off big moves that make life difficult for the invaders and your presence starts spreading across the boards.

The actual gameplay is fairly straightforward so the decisions you are making aren't all muddled in rule complexity.  

I do not recommend this game if you tend to play games only a couple of times.  This definitely requires repeated play to learn the various spirit play styles and really sink into the depths of the game.  

Reminds me a bit of Shadowrun: Crossfire due to the amount of teamwork and planning required to play well.  In Shadowrun, the game will wipe the floor with you unless you take the time to figure out the best way to approach each obstacle/enemy you encounter.

Positives:
-Various spirits that all have their own play style
-Ability to pull off combos/big moves
-Requires teamwork

Neutral to Negative:
-Steep learning curve so you'll want a dedicated group that can play it a few times back to back to really get a feel for the strategy 
-Likely not good for sporadic play
-Need to be in the right mood for a think-y, puzzle-y coop

I want to like this game so bad. It is fiddly, and has a lot of accounting going on from turn to turn. It also suffers from the same thing Vast does in my opinion...not only do you need to understand how the overall game works, but you need to understand how your individual spirit works. It rewards multiple plays, but this isn't a game that would get multiple for me anyway. 

You are so focused on your own game, and how it needs to be played, that the worst thing that happens is when another player says, "What should I do?". I don't know, how about you figure it out and do your job!

This is my absolute favorite game.  It’s quite the brain burner. It solves the alpha player problem by giving each player a lot to think about and by having players act simultaneously. Most interaction is deciding who will cover each problematic land. The play area is large enough that a single player can not even affect the majority of lands. 

I do somewhat wish that they hadn’t upgraded the invader tokens to custom plastic molds. I would have preferred more basic (and cheaper) wooden pieces. 

I also think that the expansion is essential after the first five or so plays.

I rated this a 9, but it may go up with more plays. (I'm only 8 plays in)

My favorite co-op used to be pandemic (with all expansions), and i saw this as a step up in complexity (and with a good theme). It's that and much more. 
There are 8 spirits (2 more in the expansion and 2 promo ones), which give a ton of replayability, but there are also different scenarios and 3 adversaries (with 6 levels of difficulty each). The expansion adds even more to this.

Top game of 2017 for me, and top 3 of all time. It might end up #1 very soon.

The alpha gamer problem is not very present in this game because of how much thinking and planning you have to do with your own spirit.

OH BOY. Where do I begin. I love the concept of this game. I'm not the biggest fan of the art DIRECTION of the game, but the overall look is certainly appealing. Combines dudes on a board with deckbuilding and all in a cooperative spirit (heh). I think the thing I like most of all is that the game appropriately scales depending on the number of players. Whether I play solo or with four, it's the same game. It's just purely a matter of numbers. Fewer players means a smaller map and smaller fear pool, but it means having less balance on teamwork and more reliance on luck of the draw. It's fun to play by yourself and fun to play with somebody else.

This is a cooperative game which largely involves each player looking for combos in the cards in their hands. I didn't feel like the game facilitated group play as much as individual co-play.

I wasn't drawn to the Euro-style look of the board, but the thematic back-side looks better, so my only negative for this game is very minor.  There's lots of replay-ability with the different spirit strategies and colonialist types.  I would like even more power cards, spirits, and scenarios in expansions, but the base game will inspire play for quite a while.  Components are easy to set up and put away compared to similar games.  The game mechanics are brilliant; simple rules that create complex puzzles that can be solved in several ways, if you planned ahead of time.  There's not too much luck involved, and every decision feels/is important.  Also, wiping out a city of land-blighters with a tsunami just feels good ... er ... evil-good.

RATING: 8.6
One of the best co-ops for my money. Crunchy, gorgeous looking and pleasantly deep and thematic, but also quite fiddly and a bit convoluted, as my first playthrough took literally two whole evenings. So I guess it can be a bit acquired taste, by I loved it. 

But man, the synergies between the characters and the card combos! I'd say one can achieve some very sweet BOOM-moments with this one. It's also somewhat refreshing in the co-op territory: kind of a dudes-on-a-map with hand-building and -management thrown into the mix. Plus the theme, the wonky take on anticolonialism! I dig it.

AS for comparisons in the heavier co-op category (this will probably take a few hours even if you know what you're doing), it's more "euro" as, for instance, Robinson Crusoe as there's no dice. Furthermore, the luck factor is mitigated some with the card trail system: you know a few rounds in advance what the game will do in its turn. Also: excellent solo!

Learning game with four players. I was taught the game.
Very fiddly. Keeping track of damage is a nightmare late-game. No real turn order/simultaneous play leads to a lot of downtime between turns -> slow actions are essentially impossible to plan intelligently because you have no way of knowing how all the other players' fast actions will resolve.
Seems overly complex especially with simultaneous play. Dedicated turn order would improve this game a lot!

Solid co-op with a pretty steep learning curve. There are a lot of cool things happening here. Especially with the theme and the AI controlling the settlers. I guess I just wasn't super enamored with it because it kind of felt like advanced Pandemic. It has some clever mechanisms to create progression like Pandemic does, but there are a lot more things to juggle in comparison. I didn't mind this, but I just don't know that I had as much fun as I probably should have. Still, this is a very good co-op game. One of the best to have come out in awhile. One of the few must-play games I've come across so far in 2017.

A fun cooperative game - I've only played it once so far, and definitely enjoyed it.  I can see how the spirit powers would change how you play drastically - I and my teammates were definitely playing very differently.  I would definitely like to play this again, although on a harder difficulty setting - I believe we were on the 2nd easiest.

This game is simply amazing.  Thematically, it is Catan Strikes Back against the Settlers, and plays like a cross between Magic the Gathering and Pandemic.  The anti-colonial theme is so refreshing when set against so many pro-colonial games, and the gameplay itself is a deeply satisfying, tactical and strategic puzzle, with a satisfying build-up, in which you start the game barely able to handle all the rampaging Europeans, but by the end you are swatting them away in deeply fulfilling fashion.  There is so much variety as well, with multiple asymetric spirits to play, different invaders who use different tactics, scenarios, and then an expansion (which I have yet to play but want) . . . and you almost don't need any other co-op games!   Stunning and magnificent.

I bought the game from watching reviews from Youtube. While YouTubers raved about the theme of the game, I didn't sense that while playing this game. I don't feel connected with the characters of the game or feel the compelling reasons to follow what's going on on the board. 

Regarding about its mechanics, the game constantly overwhelms the players with chain reactions of enemies in a turn. You never feel that you have enough power to push back the enemies and have to make compromises. If you like strategies and tactics, this might be the game for you. I also enjoy how the game makes you think about compromises and strategizes your plan on important areas. Yet, the theme is so lackluster or doesn't relate to me that I feel drained after playing the game.

RATING: 9
Beautiful game (art and writing), interesting mechanics, highly modular with each Spirit playing VERY differently from each other. High replayability, difficult game even on the easiest setting, and enjoyable to play. One of the few co-op games where it doesn't feel like one player is playing the game and everyone else is just along for the ride. High complexity, but also quite straightforward once you get used to the terminology. Cards and other components give information succinctly and are easy to read and understand.

I'm giving it a 9 for now - will likely change with a few more plays.

A 1-4 player cooperative area-control, card-playing game where you play as primitive spirits attempting to help local islanders repel European colonists off their island!

Positives: The components are all top-notch and the rulebook is excellent. Also love the illustrations and found the iconography easy to understand.

Negatives: The game is HARD! I mean REALLY HARD!!! Even on the easiest difficulty, the game will severely punish you for sub-optimal plays and proverbially kick you in the balls while you are down, frequently with little to nothing you can do about it!

Don’t enjoy coops, as they are not games, they are puzzles. Ooo! It has hard levels. Relentlessly flailing over and over to beat a game is the epitome of pointlessness to me. Yay! I won. I can stare at the box cover and gloat, then immediately throw it out.  If you like solving puzzles and gaining some kind of strange, inherent satisfaction from fighting a game opponent that doesn’t care if you win or lose or leave it on the shelf, then have fun!  Best part about the board game hobby is that there are more and more co-ops and solo games coming out all the time which means I’m saving a lot of money by not buying any more games.

I want to like this game more. A lot more, in fact. We may need to try the advanced rules or something, because the first part of the game feels very enjoyable, but after we ramp up the game kind of always ends on a very "oh, we won" kind of note. 

The first part of the game is not too easy, but once you get rolling, it seems to never get harder. In fact, the end conditions get easier, but even if you ignore them and keep them static, the game still get laughably easy near the end without additional difficulty being added via advanced  variant.

A true case of "It's not you...it's me..."

I wanted to like Spirit Island, I really did. And as a product, it's a well produced, well thought out game. It's just not a game that I enjoyed. It's not a game my wife, or my friends enjoyed either. That's not a condemnation of the game itself, it's purely a personal perferance in this case. I've played games that are just badly designed with poor mechanics, badly produced, etc. and this is not one of those games. I just didn't like it.

Ok so what's not to like? It sounds, on-paper, to be a nearly ideal game for me and my play group. We're not new to games, we're not lightweights, but this game was just brutally hard. Not impossible, just brutally hard. It took the whole table a serious amount of brain burning effort to even come close to winning and even then winning was unlikely at best. In the event of a win, it felt like we'd just got done taking a several hour mid-term exam. If we lost, then we still felt that way, just demoralized at the same time. We lost a lot more than we ever won.

In the end, the enjoyment received from the time and energy spent playing the game just wasn't worth it. I sold it on the BGG marketplace and I truly hope the new owner gets more enjoyment out of it.

Perhaps it was so hyped for me that I didn't appreciate like the common word. Expected to be blown away, found it alright. Enjoyed playing a lightening god. For me this just missed the mark and the play time being so long has me not really excited to play again. Other co-op games I enjoy more. There is a lot of replay value here though with different maps and alternate gods and decks of cards. I can see why people enjoy it.

This game has smooth mechanics, deep play, and great (scalable) challenge.  Best of all, it has an incredible theme that is well executed. 

I look forward to new spirits, foes, and any other ideas the creators have, even if the game is already so varied that it will take ages to exhaust the many options and combinations thereof that are present.  

Spirit Island has captured my imagination in a way that few other games have. I even enjoy the (and look forward to more) lore about the Island and the Dahan that helps to enliven the game and invest the players in the future of their imaginary world.

This is one of the most interesting co-op games I've seen yet. Each player gets an asymmetric board and starting hand of cards, and then players collectively need to protect their island from invading white meeples. One white meeple doesn't bother anything, but if he is left in place he multiplies, and 2 white meeples in a spot start ravaging the land. The game is marvelously low luck as the white meeples spread fairly slowly and logically, and the only chance element is that of drawing new action cards, which is thankfully a draw 4 keep 1. The player's abilities are very different, and each player is also trying to gather cards with symbols that allow them to perform the free actions on their player boards, so there's really no way to quarterback this game which is a delight for a co-op. The game allows for marvelous combos that let you feel really clever when you pull them off. It also has an extremely variable level of difficulty so you can have the game punch you in the face as hard as you like. I don't know that I could ask for more from a co-op game, which is a genre I usually don't get that excited about.

I played it twice solo. First time I didn't really understand how it was even possible to win. Made a couple mistakes in my favor and still got crushed pretty quickly. It still felt fun due to the thematic nature of the game. The second play I realized a few different things about holding cards back to combo them together and it was much easier. Won pretty easily. "Getting" some of the combos felt really cool. 

I only played it with one Spirit and with the starting player progression system so I am eager to try it with choosing my own cards and picking my own combos and also synergizing with another spirit. Seems really fun so far. Best coop I've played so far definitely.

UPDATE 10/23/17: Okay I've played the game 22 times now. Definitely the best coop and solo game I've played. It is very fiddly and with the expansion the game gets fiddlier and more random. But the expansion also gives more variety and strategy.

I knew going in that this game would be long and difficult, but it still took me a few games to grasp just quite how long and difficult it was supposed to be. There's quite the learning curve in rules, terms, and player powers. I also think we chose spirits that might not have made for the easiest first games (River and Lightning). I didn't feel like I could rate Spirit Island after even three plays, as I felt a bit frustrated with it. But on our last play, #5, oh man... Everything just clicked. My husband had a firm command of Earth, and I finally felt like I knew what I was doing with Lightning. We kept the Invaders tamped down, and our powers kept growing. Eventually, our combos became unstoppable. I was able to set him up, and he knocked their two strongholds down. So incredibly fun. I can see spending time to perfect our use of these spirits, to learn others, to increase the difficulty and face different Invaders... There's so much in this box, and so much to explore (or repel). So very fun. It's nice to have a challenging co-op that's a step up from Pandemic and defies quarterbacking. I'm glad we persevered!

Although I generally don't care much about theme and hardly ever get immersed in it, with this game I actually felt offended by the colonists destroying my island. Though nicely detailed, the bright white, square-shaped invaders even look intrusive among the other more organic components. On top of that, the game mechanics are great and it scales wonderfully. Moreover, it's a real challenge to win this game; the spirits really have to work together, but the spirit asymmetry prevents alpha gamer syndrome. A true masterpiece.

After a couple solo plays, it feels challenging with just the intro rules. The game was designed with many ways to scale the difficulty so I doubt I will get bored anytime soon.

The complexity doesn't come from the rules or the cards, but the dynamic nature of the play map. It is a brain frying game of wack-a-mole.

Will update later after a couple multiplayer plays.

RATING: 7
Positives:
 - uses asymmetrically distributed complexity between players to avoid coop-by-committee
 - novel theme that reverses normal colonial setups without being preachy
 - lots of well balanced special powers and asymmetric powers; toys!

Concerns:
 - daunting to teach; feels heavy to learn but medium-weight to play once you understand it, so there is a disconnect between beginners and intermediate players
 - can be fiddly, especially with expansion, increasing chance of a mistaken rule that leaves a dissatisfied feeling
 - with highly varied player skill levels, it can still decay into puppeteering

Overall, it's a solid card-driven coop.

Caveat:  I know the designer and helped playtest early versions of the design.

I've played my friends' playtest copy of Spirit Island multiple times, where you play as different nature spirits with unique powers and cooperatively have to defend your island from settler pieces (which are all white) with the help of the native population, jungle beasts, and tropical diseases. It's got a wealth of interesting powers, has you juggling tech tracks, positioning, and resources, and avoids the quarterbacking problem through turn-based simultaneous play and giving you enough to worry about on your own.  I'm not usually a fan of most coop games, but it was fun and engaging, and it seems like it has a lot of replay value between the different spirits, powers, and invader scenarios.  The biggest downside is that the planning phase can be analysis-paralysis-inducing, as you need to decide which growth options to take which alter which resources and powers you have, and then you need to pick two or more power cards to play.

I've played a few times solo, using both 1 and 2 spirits. I love the way this game develops and accelerates enough to feel like you are making progress towards your goal while the invaders are stepping up their game. Yet at the same time, it doesn't accelerate so fast that you feel really overwhelmed by the choices you get at anytime. I look forward to playing more of the spirits and to playing this in a multiplayer setting.

Spirit Island is a phenomenal cooperative game. It turns several board game conventions on their head: first, you're fighting against settlers, whereas most board games featuring settlers have you playing from the perspective of those settlers. Second, most cooperative games feature localized characters that move around from location to location, but Spirit Island plays more like an area influence game. 

There is a ton of variability in the game: different spirits have different play styles, the minor and major powers you draw over the course of the game will be different, you can play against different adversaries and different scenarios, you can play with different blight cards, you can play with either side of the map and using different combinations of map tiles, and the order the invader cards come up will change how the game plays out. Adding in the expansion increases this even more with almost twice as many minor and major powers, increased power diversity, and events that can help both sides. You can attack the invaders directly, defend areas and use the Dahan natives to fight off encroaching invaders, or try to scare the invaders off.

I've heard Spirit Island described as cooperative Magic the Gathering to murder the Settlers of Catan, and that's a pretty accurate way to describe the feel of the game, although Spirit Island is both much more thematically grounded, and has better mechanics than either Magic or Catan.

It's a ton of simple rules that net a ton of text to assess without satisfying effects. Everything moves pieces or causes or prevents damage with lots of fiddling to get there.

Cannot recommend.

Tentative rating after 1.5 plays. Interested in trying it more. My biggest reservation is that it's very calculation-oriented, and it's complex enough that there's a lot of calculating to do. But the flipside of that is it seems pretty deep.

Absolutely love this game.  Bought the expansion and won't ever look back.  Definitely a top-10 game for me, and that's so exciting because finding a game that really jives with you is a great feeling.  I'm playing it 100% solitaire (either 1 or 2 spirits) and can't get over how much replayability there is.  If you asked me to pick between this and Mage Knight, I'm not sure what I would do...


Received 8/10/17 via Amazon.

5 solitaire plays in:  3x with 1 Spirit, 2 x with two Spirits.  Have won each one, with me slowly escalating difficulty.  My initial thoughts:

1.  It's not that hard of a game to learn.  Just set up a 2-player game with all the bits and bobbles, and play through a couple practice turns.  Mage Knight is MUCH more demanding (and frustrating), in terms of a million little rules you need to remember.  Once you get into the flow of this game, you don't need player aids anymore.  
2.  It definitely falls within the coop-camp of putting fires out (Pandemic, Arkham Horror, etc.,etc.) which I thought I was entirely bored of - but this game manages to feel fresh and interesting regardless.  What wins it for me is that, like Mage Knight, all the crucial decision making comes down to smart card-play.  The card play isn't quite as brain-burny (and satisfying) as MK, but it's still very crunchy and rewards deep thinking.  There are times when you'll work out the perfect turn only to realize at that last moment that you don't have quite enough energy to pull it off, or the land you were hoping to target is slightly out of reach.
3.  The theme is great and definitely draws me in.
4.  The base difficulty level is not that hard, if you're used to semi-complex board games.  Indeed, I'd go so far as to say that base difficulty is easy mode, and you really need to use the Difficulty ratings (adversaries, scenarios, more fear cards, etc., etc.) to make it a significant challenge.  I think this is a good thing!  I sort of hate coop games that enjoy bashing you over the head, and you realizing that you're not going to win unless you get some significant luck on your side.
5.  Caveat:  my above comments on difficulty may only apply to solitaire play where one person gets to make all the decisions!  I can imagine that in true co-op mode, players won't work as synergistically as they possibly could.  But again, I think the game will present those groups with a nice challenge at base level - but nothing close to unfair.
6.  The components are pleasing, and I really like how it doesn't take up too much table-space.  This makes it a very nice solitaire option.
7.  On that note, it's definitely playable solitaire with either one Spirit or two (I prob wouldn't try 3).  Two is slightly more interesting - better map, larger number of problems/decisions to juggle, greater interactivity between the Spirits - but one is totally fine for a quicker, less taxing (but still challenging) game.
8.  I can see it being somewhat contentious.  It's got a great welcoming theme, but it's not a casual game.  Ultimately, it is all about managing fires while attempting to satisfy your victory condition.  It's very puzzly.  You have to think one (sometimes more) turn ahead.  This style of game will just turn off some people, esp. given its relative complexity compared to most co-ops. I'm not sure I'll ever play this with other people.  But even as just a solitaire game, it thoroughly succeeds.

I'm going to wait and see how I feel about it after I get 10+ plays in.  As of now, I feel very positive about Spirit Island (8.5? 9.0?!).  Compared to my other solitaire favorites (Mage Knight, Nemo's War, LoTR LCG), it slides right in.  More strategic/thinky than Nemo, and not as time-consuming as MK.  Love it!

Enjoying the variable player powers, and the fact that there is a ton of replayability as the more advanced aspects of the game get added. I like how player collaboration works, which is superior. Personally, I'm not as crazy about the art, and wish the towns and cities were wooden, but the theme is solid, and the game deserves a  9 for giving us so many interesting play sessions, for a variety of challenge levels, and for plenty of replayability. Hoping to see some expansions with more Major/Minor cards, and more spirits. Perhaps, also some wooden town and city tokens.

RATING: 9
9, but could hit 10 status. 
There's a lot to like here. It's a heavy-ish co-op that has some beautiful interactions and synergies. This, so far, is seeming to be a masterwork blend of strategy and theme. 

You can plan out a couple turns in advance while trying to keep an overarching strategy on track. There's enough randomness that throw some wrenches into your plans, but it's predictable enough to not feel totally screwed by the system even though it is RELENTLESS. It does a good job of making you feel [i]nearly[/i] hopeless, and the rewards of ridding sections of invaders by pulling off powerful combos is highly satisfying. 

Trying to plan out the element powers on the cards and the ebb and flow of growth actions is great. There is a lot to consider. I played a two handed solo game which was mind-meltingly beautiful as I was trying to coordinate the actions of two spirits. This is harder to do in a multiplayer experience, but still a lot of fun to try to coordinate.  

The asymmetry of powers is just plain fun. I've played as the River, Earth, and Lightning spirits, and they have all felt unique and flavorful. My favorite so far is the river. I love pushing the invaders around to assist with powerful combo attacks with other spirits. 

There is a good gradation of difficulty and a variety of scenarios and adversaries to explore. I am still exploring the vanilla game, but I have given cursory glances at the scenario/adversary material and they look fun. The expansion also looks pretty neat and seems to really bring this little island to life! 

tldr: First impressions: wow! One of the best co-ops I have tried.

Best Kickstarter I've ever done!
The game is a thinky challenging puzzle. It's quite thematic (destroy the white invaders!) but it's not for the faint of heart. There are a number of interlocking mechanisms. At its heart are the various spirit powers and since there are a LOT of those and they are all different, it'll be hard to keep all of it dancing in your brain. I've played solo,  2 player, and 3 player and enjoyed both the solo and coop immensely. (Co-op is more fun, of course, with a real feeling of a team working to eliminate the white invaders!). The game is reasonably beatable at the base level (I think you should win the great majority of base level games) but has a nice difficulty escalation system to gradually ramp up the challenges. My feeling is you should just die die die at the top levels (but I'm still learning the game).

Difficult but very fun co-op. My girlfriend and I love playing this game and cackling as we drown, burn, and otherwise nightmarishly torment the invading Europeans. It is a bit overly complex, and could have used one or two more streamlining passes. 

To play this game well, and to win on higher (and certainly the highest) difficulties, you can find yourself laboriously calculating every single turn for upwards of ten minutes, and that's just with two players. I honestly cannot imagine trying to play with 4 people (again, on high difficulties), as the amount of coordinating that would be necessary would be completely unfeasible and exhausting as opposed to engaging. 

I honestly believe the most fun way to play this game is to play at the lower difficulties (Levels 0-3ish), and just play more freestyle. Put an approximate time limit on turns to keep things moving and don't worry about planning every single tile. Playing the game at a brisker pace one turn at a time is far more fun than exhaustively attempting to plan 3 turns in advance while coordinating with one to three other players doing the same thing, all just to claim a Level 9 victory after an exhausting 4 hour game.

All that said, the game is brilliant for its inherent and well-defined difficulty levels that allows for different styles and approaches of play.

Looking forward to playing this one again.  I really enjoyed the powers and how the energy is handled.  After a round or two the strategy began evident for my character, but there's enough randomization from the cards and other player's actions that you must still react and observe to get the most out of your spirit.  Very fun, very good, just a touch fiddly.  But I expect the management of AI to improve as we all understand what we need to do.  Also:  very hard, in a good way.

Took about six plays for me to feel like I really had the hang of this game. I recommend not trying to play as more than one spirit at least while you are learning the game because it does have some weight to it. I kept trying to play as 4 Spirits starting out and that was pretty overwhelming. You can do that in other games pretty easy but this one just has to much going on if you are trying to pick it up for the first time. Its a pretty unique game and if you are into games that have more complexity then I recommend giving this one a try.

Why it is a 10:

Large Decision Space: This game has a very involved decision space, but this is by design.  R. Eric Reuss wanted to mitigate the alpha player problem by populating the game with too much information for one person to track it all.  Players have to keep track of where the invaders will act on between 2 to 16 places on the board, based off of the stage of the game and player count, for ravaging and again for building, with 1 to 21ish power plays based off of player count and how developed the spirits are, with even more powers to consider for these plays.  Add this with the positions of the friendly AI, the timing of the powers, the amount of damage already dealt to the land, the failure conditions, the location of the spirits, the range of their powers, the amount of energy each spirit has, how the spirits should develop, and how their powers combo off of one another, it is easy for one player to become overwhelmed while managing the board for a team of 4.  The amount of information for one player is easy to manage for one person, but each added player is an order-of-magnitude more information that needs considered; dividing the responsibility for this information among the players is the essence of coop.  

Variability: Different Spirits, different powers, different invaders, different invader cards, different synergies, different map set up.  Lots of things to tweak between sessions to keep things interesting.

Class Types: Each titular spirit has some different way to achieve victory.  Some try to keep explorers suppressed so there are not many threats, others try to protect the Dahan during ravaging so that they destroy the invaders, others still race to generate enough fear to trigger a win before the invaders cause them to lose.  This gives each player a different slice of solution pie that they get to enjoy on their own, or share with others at their discretion.

Why oh why do I keep doing this? These types of games just aren't for me. I can't see the long term strategy and I usually am so lost by a few turns that it's not fun for the others either. I am going to learn to just politely say I'm not interested and leave the game night if I have to.

Played the Print and Play version during Kickstarter period. Very fiddly, and despite comments that the theme was strong, I disagree. If you have a power that moves a city from one region to another, without destroying it, then that doesn't feel consistent with the theme - that's just manipulating the gameboard.

Multiple plays will be needed just to establish a gameplay rhythm so you can start to understand how to co-operate.

Overall, this game feels like it needs to be streamlined. If you have several other friends who love their AP, or are going to be happy to persevere through multiple gameplays to reach basic familiarisation levels, then maybe this game is for you.

[i][size=18]Amazing theme and unique mechanics make this one of the few co-ops to rise above the rest[/size][/i]

Co-ops are my favorite genre of boardgames, so I try to play or at least read the rules on pretty much every co-op that gets published.  Other than a few campaign or story-based games, no co-ops have really jumped out at me for several years.  [thing=162886][/thing] is the first one to really grab my attention since probably 2012.

Here are some of he highlights:
:star: [b]Theme is amazing.[/b]  Each player is a spirit that inhabits an island of natives.  You are trying to help the natives fend off the foreign invaders (colonists) from defiling (developing) the land.  It's like you are playing Catan, but from the perspective of the island.  I love it.  I also love the fact that the natives do a lot of the fighting, and you are working behind the scenes to help them.
:star: [b]Visually appealing.[/b]  The art and pieces are fantastic.  The two-sided board unfortunately has a "pretty side" that is basically unplayable, and a "basic side" that's very utalitarian.
:star: [b]Highly Variable Powers[/b] There are 8(?) spirits to play, and they all play completely differently.  You also acquire powers throughout the game in a quasi-draft mechanic, that allows you to further customize your spirit.
:star: [b]Simple, yet deep choices.[/b] There really aren't a lot of decisions to make on your turn, but they are all very important.  Feels a bit like [thing=121921][/thing].

If I had to pick nits...
:nostar: [b]Too heavy?[/b] This is a brain burner, comparable to perhaps [thing=96848][/thing] with less fiddliness.  I don't mind so much, but it limits the audience I can play this with.
:nostar: [b]Limited interaction?[/b] I've played twice with 4 players, and (perhaps because of the heaviness), I basically had no idea what everyone else was doing.  You are each on your own corner of the island, and it takes all of my brain power to make my decisions, let alone watch what everyone else is doing.  I'm curious how it plays with 2 or 3 when there is less going on.

I need to give it more plays, but this might end up being my second favorite co-op of the last 3 or 4 years, behind only [thing=174430][/thing].

This seems great, with Twinge, StormKnight and tjshields all liking it. Rahdo also put it in his top 10 games of the year. I do worry slightly that maybe this'll be too heavy for M (Tom Vasel gives it 1.5 thumbs up, but Sam only gives it 1 thumb and Zee gives it just half a thumb), but it seems worth a shot.

Interesting that looking at StormKnight's review (https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/146419/item/5565830#item5565830) he says it only takes an hour. He notes that it's group play oriented (no limits on communication and that coordination is required for good play), which is certainly a slight bummer to hear.

I like managing energy, presence, and card symbols. That part feels like an engine-building euro. The asymmetry is also nice as each character feels much different.

I've only played on the easiest setting so far, but the game is a little too easy at that level. It's probably best to start off on level one or two.

My biggest issue is the randomness. If you get a card that lets you destroy multiple buildings then you're almost guaranteed to win. Just generate tons of fear until you reach the next fear level, then focus on nothing but destroying buildings to win. If you don't happen to draw a card that lets you destroy multiple buildings the game could drag on.

There's also a good deal of randomness in the event and fear cards. Sometimes they will completely miss, other times they can have a huge impact on the game.

And depending on the players, a 3-4 player game can easily go over three hours.

Overall I like the game for the asymmetry and euro-style management. The length and randomness keep it from being great, though.

There is a lot of game in this box. The iconography and graphic design are very well done and the game's components are impressive. The level of difficulty granularity is staggering and the variable player powers should give the game real legs.

The game did feel more AP inducing than any cooperative game I've played to date and, if given the opportunity, it feels like quarterbacking could become a real issue.

I look forward to future plays and hope my worries about AP were simply due to being unfamiliar with the game.

While the game can be fiddly, the experience here is excellent. The theme isn’t just pasted on and the game tells a story, even through the component materials. It runs through the game and informs your decisions, sometimes you just don’t want to let any of the natives perish. Some of the spirits are a tad on rails, but there are so many to choose from (especially when you have the expansion and promo content) that they can largely be saved for new players. The game is not without its flaws, but it provides a deep cooperative experience that largely prevents the quarterbacking so often found in this style of game.

RATING: 9
Very good cooperative experience, I enjoyed this game both solo and with my wife.

Biggest Pros:

- Cool theme. Settlers try to build cities and gather resources from an unexplored island - and you play as the island! Well... almost, you play as spirits of the island, and your goal is to crush the invaders, or scare them away. This is a fresh and interesting theme, beautifully illustrated by the nice artwork, and integrated well into all the different cards and powers.

- Very different player powers. Your approach to win this game can fundamentally change with the "spirit" you are playing, and the combination with your other players. "Lightning" tries to destroy cities and towns as quickly as possible, the "Ocean" open the possibility for every player to drown your enemies in the waters, "Nightmares" cannot destroy anything at all and tries to frighten the invaders until they leave on their own.

- Highly variable experience. In addition to spirit selection, you can add scenarios that all bring a different feel into the game, and adversaries with fine-grained difficulty levels. But even if you play with the samecombination of spirits/scenario/aversary, the game induces just enough randomness that every play feels fresh.

- Rules make sense. Yes, there are a bunch of rules you have to remember, but you can explain almost every rule thematically. In the build phase, the invaders build towns after they have explored the land, explorers need a nearby town/city to start their journey, or they arrive with a new ship from the ocean. I very rarely had to check something in the rulebook.

Additional pros: Nice components, interesting decisitons, good solo experience, native huts look like mushrooms.

Cons:

- The rulebook itself is structured in a weird way. The first half contains just an overview and misses important details. These are explained seperately in the second half. Not really sure if this is generally good or bad, but I struggled a bit with my first read.

- Can induce analysis paralysis. You have lots of choices, and can try to think one or two turns ahead, but even then it is rarely possible to detemine which move is best. We try to think about the most importants dangers and then hope for the best.

- Game length with full player count (Maybe?). Our first learning game with two players went just over two hours. Player turns can run parallel is many parts, but I still think that a four player game with explanation might go for three hours. As always, repeated play cuts the game length significantly.


Verdict:

Highly recommended!

This game is small on the outside and huge on the inside.  It has replay-ability to go for a while.  This is a good game for folks that like co-ops,  but yet really want to learn the game, because it really will shine once you have multiple plays.  So if you are a 1-3 times and then move on to the next game this is not for you.  However, if you are a person who wants to get fully engrossed and play this game for several weeks, and multiple plays then you will love it.  Rulebook is pretty to look at, and the text is large... but it is not well constructed and goes back and forth too much, Example - You should not explain a rule, then have examples of that rule three pages later, and then repeat the same rules in Game Concept sections, that includes information needed that is not included in the base rules.   Anyway with all of that said, once you get it down, it's okay, but the timing and rule clarification lists on BGG I am sure will continue to grow...

I am not fond of coops, variable player powers or playing solitaire but this one I like so far. After a few plays I'm a bit worried that I might end up feeling bored at pretty much doing the same few actions over and over. It's hidden by the different cards and the spirits' special powers so let's see.

Promos: Heart of the Wildfire & Serpent Slumbering Beneath the Island Promo Spirits.

Outstanding. With ease the most solid heavy co-op out there; one of the best solo too. Plays marvelously well from 1 to 4.

Too complex for what it needs to be. Colonists attacks are confusing. Just not the type of co-op I want to play. It also breeds alpha leaders and quarterbacking like I have never seen before. I though it was a gaming group, but it happened in another group as well. People were visibly angry at each other. It's as if the Spirits were pushing us away from this game.

1st impressions: Really intriguing co-op - keen to explore further. Feels like Pandemic with a euro engine build tacked on. A lot more puzzley and complex - definitely not a gateway game!

Such a great game. Great theme, art, rulebook, components. Everything in this game is designed to make it more accessible - from the setup being printed right on the boards to the progressive power deck setup for your 1st game. This is one of those special games where I think about it all day after playing it.

I've only played VERY early prototype versions, but even then it was one of the best co-op games I've ever played.  Tense gameplay with a lot of tough choices mixed with a handful of unique mechanics makes for a great experience.  As far as I can tell it's only gotten better since.

Possible downsides include the game length and potential AP issues (choosing a few cards out of a wide selection can be very difficult), so I'll be curious to see how things are implemented in current versions next time I get a chance to.

This game is an invigorating breath of fresh air in the context of so many games with a settler POV. Though we have just scratched the surface of possible spirit combinations, I can tell that our ability to synthesize the spirits' powers should only increase over the course of more plays. Due to the length and the intensity of the game, I think that the other co-ops in our collection will probably see more table time, but this game is an excellent change of pace when the need arises.

Very impressed by this co-op. Lots of decisions in what to do on a turn. Good ramp up of those evil colonists. A little fiddly with putting on and taking off figures on the board, but manageable. With more than 2 players, it's probably easier if each player manages adding colonists to their own island at the appropriate phase.

Didn't do the trick for me or my group. Art is gorgeous and gameplay is solid but after two plays it didn't click with us. The endgame feels kind of anticlimatic. Suddenly the game just ends. Also, too much downtime with the group discussing what to do and trying to optimize and make the perfect turn. Game feels longer that it should.

Finally a game that sees colonization as a blight or crime rather than noble venture. Unfortunately this is a busy/complicated combat game.

The release is delayed until March 2017.

Only a few plays in, but really loving this: Mage Knight-like brain burn, but with a much faster setup and playtime.  Excellent fun, and fantastic replayability due to the different core Spirits and possible match-ups. Have only played solo. A half-dozen plays over Christmas holidays, and liking it even more; feels as though I've only scratched the surface of replayability.  Will start playing with adversaries next.

One of the best co-ops I have ever played. If you like a challenging co-op, this one is for you. The game bleeds theme and the spirits are original and play totally different. You won't get the same game twice.

A meaty co-op game with tons of content and difficulty options right out of the box. Each spirit plays to its own strengths and can take quite a bit to master, which is an excellent way of mitigating quarterbacking because most players will be unable to optimally play their own piece of the game while also dictating others play.

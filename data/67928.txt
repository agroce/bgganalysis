151117 as my rating for dominion continues to hold steady, my need for this game declines preciptiously, especially given my dislike of Sirlin's crafted persona.

120102 dominion clone, but it looks fun with more of a direct take that aspect to it.  My one play was rushed so I think it may go up in future games -- however it may also go down since I'm not sure I enjoy the whole dominion lay down a few types of cards on the table to purchase mechanism.

A decent Dominion clone with poker chips. It strays further from the Dominion mould than other similar games like Tanto Cuore or Penny Arcade due to its heavy reliance on attack chips, health tokens (gems) and player elimination. Whether this improves the game is questionable, but it is at least a bit different, which is a good thing in an overdone genre.

Game was okay, funny interaction between your neighbours, seems that the base cards of building up large negative points to pass to your neighbour outweigh the different possible action combos that might also be included in the game.

Decent [b]Dominion[/b]-style game...maybe one of the better ones yet.  Gorgeous production with chips and bags.  Not sure why I don't like this more, but I'd be happy to play it again.  I just may not seek out a copy on my own.

RATING: 6
+ Way better theme than Dominion; Game escalates as it gets closer and closer to the end.
- The holding of your hand of chips can be a little cumbersome at times.


Why it's previously-owned:
For a two-player game, it's a bit tug-of-war-ish. For more players, I'd rather be playing many other games.  
I got High Frontier in trade for this.

A pretty decent deckbuilder, probably to your taste if you'd like more interaction than Dominion gives but enjoy that game otherwise.  Played second edition with the third ed Combine rule.  The chips make me think wistfully of just how well designed it turns out cards are.

RATING: 3
In theory this should be cool:  a more interactive Dominion-concept, with characters.  In practice, the back-n-forth nature of the crashing&combining makes purples more key to all decks than, say, money is in Dominion.  There are other ways to get VPs in Dominion; there are no effective alternatives to combine/crash here, just decisions of 1) annoy your opponent so they can't do it as well to you 2) be super fast through your deck (a Dominion strategy as well) or 3) have just a LOT of purple power.

A shame:  there's a concept here that could be fun.  But it lasts a long time to a moderately random conclusion, exacerbated by the high luck of "oh, didn't get a crash this turn?  YOU LOSE"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I guess when one hits 30 plays of something one can judge clearly.

A chip based deck building game of smacking your opponents in the face with gems. Combining and crashing gems is like breathing - you have to do it to stay alive, but the puzzle chips and character chip uses will be what makes the difference between victory and defeat.

Without the upgrade pack it was good, but there were characters who were pretty boring (i.e. only monopurple was viable).

Since getting the upgrade pack it has really come into its own and strategy and counter strategy seem more achievable.

My favourite character concept was Geiger and now he is well worth the effort.

Best with two (and that's an understatement), just about viable with three and with four it's a waste of time. As two player games go, it's amazing. Play and enjoy.

Good idea and great theme (I'm a fan of both Puzzle Fighter and Yomi), but the game itself didn't work out for me. I thought I would like the appeal of chips and its convenience, but in reality they were harder to read and hold, as well as less interesting without artwork. The crash gems is innovative but perhaps abit too overpowered and essential.

This game was one that I really wanted to love, but in the end I found Dominion to be more of my liking.

The decision to trade it away came when I realized that if I wanted a Puzzle Fighter experience, then I would much rather play the actual Puzzle Fighter than this.

RATING: 8
Fun deck building game and that's a MAJOR compliment from me.  Generally speaking, I loathe deck building games like Dominion, Ascension etc because they are too strategic and not tactical enough.  Pick your stacks that you want to focus on at the beginning of the game and it's pretty much auto-pilot after that  However Puzzle Strike sticks out in a few key ways:

#1 Asymmetric Starting hands - 10 different characters (20 in expansion).
#2 Direct attack mechanism - must make more tactical decisions each turn.
#3 Buying cards in and of itself is not the mechanism for victory (see Direct attack mechanism).
#4 Piggy bank mechanism allows you to save for future turns, making it much more tactical
#5 Different color actions - washing a color, forking

Need to try it with re-balanced chips, new Shadows expansion. Tentatively an 8 but has potential to go higher.

RATING: 5
Rating based on two 4P games, played using the standard rules.  The shuffling in Dominion doesn't bother me too much.  Chips were fine too, although not quite as easy for me to manage in-hand.  Really liked the idea of variable player powers.  In the game, I didn't find myself caring at all what people did on their turns - unlike Dominion.  I'm not exactly sure why that is, although I think it may be that the random chips don't interest me as much.  It's possible that art and size is a factor.  Outside of the gems being shared between board and hand, I liked the game setup overall but hated the downtime between turns and didn't like the carryover damage.  The character strength seemed highly variable in my novice assessment, in addition to being sensitive to available chips and player counts.  I'd give it another shot with 2P or 3P, or a 4P team variant.  Mostly, it bored me and made me want to play Dominion.  And the elimination resulted in a long lag for one player in our first game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
+ Easier to setup and quicker than Dominion.
- Childish art, no theme, more chaotic. The gem thingy is the only new mechanic which I suspect will get tiresome in a couple of plays. Another Dominion wannabe, worse than the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun game, though it has a little too much downtime with four players.  I think it would be more interesting with just two.  With four, you're a little too dependent on the player two spaces away from you to keep the player on your right in check.  But I like the basic concepts, and I do like the chips, though the game would probably be just as good with cards.  Need more plays.

Been waiting months to finally get my copy of PS and am I ever ecstatic. Gameplay is surprisingly deep, but the presentation (love the chips) and the pace of the game result in an overall light experience. Roommates and I have been playing nonstop since the game arrived yesterday afternoon and are still having difficulty pulling ourselves away. Absolute recommended buy.

For those concerned with production issues, my deluxe set (#52) is in perfect playable condition with all updates and all chips included. I can understand that for the price point a lot of people had high expectations for production value but seriously come on - the deluxe set was expensive because it was a collector's item not because it was gold plated. I feel like I received something unique from a small publisher that I can show off to people. Wood chips feel great, occasional misprints are minor and barely noticable.

The standard version is affordable and should be on everybody's christmas list this year.

Cute game in the Dominion style. The victory condition is interesting, in that you get bonuses for having more gems in your gem pile ... until you have too many, and you lose. Chips instead of cards is a matter of taste, although against young opponents it's better, because they can't shuffle.

RATING: 7
Puzzle Strike has managed to build something different on Dominion's base. First and foremost there's a lot more interaction here, this is reflected by the goal of this game - to eliminate all opponents and be the last man standing. Secondly, players' starting decks substantially differ from each other which makes for a nice change when playing different characters and thus provide more longevity for the game. I like the components too, I have nothing against cards but I like chips as a refreshing change.

Puzzle strike is a deckbuilding game without cards, and this is by itself an improvement: no need to shuffle countless times and no need for sleeves are big props!
The game simulates a game of puzzle fighting (and I absolutely have no clue of what that is...), and there are 10 different characters, each one with 3 custom starting chips, one can choose to play.
The game is really fast (it has a built-in clock) and it has two more great advantages on Dominion or other deckbuilders: it is more interactive (because of the gem-crashing mechanic) and it presents _hard_ choices! When playing Dominion, Thunderstone, Ascension or Quarriors, every hand plays itself and everything is very obvious. In Puzzle Strike, on the contrary, the continuous tension between different needs (controlling the gempile, acquiring more purchase power, managing your deck composition) makes things very hard to evaluate.
Definitely hope to play it very much! By far the best deckbuilding game out there!

this feels like the best dominion clone so far, but i need to play more to see if it's ever a good idea to buy puzzle chips and not money+violets

edit: I feel way to constrained here, with some characters totally unplayable. lack of any sensible choices annoys me greatly. perhaps if I invested a lot of time to get to know every character, but what with the fiddliness of the chips, the box insert that is impossible to take out easily yet the bags only fit underneath - I am unlikely to try again.

I don't usually like to rate games as a "1" as most games truly don't deserve them, but I feel that I need to draw attention to the fact that David Sirlin, the designer of this game has behaved in ways that I find unacceptable and I think folks really should educate themselves before throwing money his way.

Mr. Sirlin's book, "Playing to Win" paints an extremely bleak portrait of what's going on in this guys head. What Sirlin's take on things essentially boils down to is that playing board and video games (read TOYS) should be a means of proving ones superiority over your friends and loved ones.  If you hold any other opinion, he's more than ready to tell you you're wrong.  He's told anyone who plays CCGs to leave his forums, nevermind if you're a fan of his work or a paying customer.  And then there's the whole part where he PLAGIARIZED someone else's work for the chip design in Puzzle Strike.

The following link, while humorous in nature, runs through the first chapter of Sirlin's book.  Jokes aside, take a look and ask yourself if you really want to encourage Sirlin any further.
http://www.projectafterforums.com/index.php?showtopic=1363

I'm not telling anyone to not buy his games, but given that he is pretty much a one man operation, please keep in mind that you're truly voting with your dollars in this case.

His games entirely derivative anyway.

[PnP Version] Definitely my favorite of the Dominion-style games.  Gets my vote for being the most different, and for the first time actually developing the mechanic.

The different starting hands are just brilliant.  Giving everyone a different strategy to start means it's a different game each time you play.

The game finally addresses the "action-glut" of the genre.  It realizes that focusing on too many actions not only slows the game down, but is a losing strategy.  The action chips in the game are only five of each pile, and considering you'll be hit so often with gems from opposing players, you'll be worried more about staying alive than which four-card action combo to adopt.

Well designed, well tested, just good looking.  A breath of fresh air.

Not a bad game.  Probably would improve with more plays, but I don't see any benefits over Dominion.  The tiles in the bag feel more fiddly than shuffling cards. The active attack stuff is a nice change from Dominion, but overall I probably won't ask to play it again.

RATING: 6
Puzzle Strike feels almost nothing like Dominion. Since buying a chip each turn is mandatory, and you always have as many buys as you want, the emphasis of the game is far less on getting a money engine and more on effectively doing bad things to your opponent. Also, bad turns are far worse in Puzzle Strike, and good turns aren't as good.

There is an imposing learning curve, with three contributing factors. First, what you need to do to win is so different from Dominion that your level of expertise with that game proportionally hinders your ability to get this one. Second, each character plays differently enough that understanding what you're supposed to be doing with, say, Jaina helps not at all in being able to play with DeGrey. Third, learning to be sensitive to what your opponents are buying is difficult when you don't know if they know what they're doing.

The chips work very well, but take some getting used to. They feel small, and the number gems are hard to distinguish because the important information is in the middle of the chip, but it doesn't take much practice to be able to handle them competently. The bags are pleasantly voluminous, allowing for shuffling and stacking within.

TRADED - Prospect of having to buy an updated version every year for 'rebalancing' and realization that no one I knew wanted to play it, preferring more revolutionary deckbuliders such as Nightfall. 

A very fun, fast and furious deck building game.  Character match-ups keep things fresh, and also give you something to strive for (if you settle on a favourite and aim for mastery!) 

The quality of the chips is fantastic and it comes with bags to put your 'deck' in for easy drawing.  Also, the storage tray works like a charm, be nice it if was better labeled, but that's easy enough to fix.

RATING: 7
Dominion + Combat (direct conflict). 

This one should appeal to the Ameritrashers who don't like Dominion's mostly-passive "victory point" objective. Yeah, Dominion can get confrontational if there happen to be a lot of Attack cards in the mix, but Puzzle Strike is a back-alley brawl by comparison. Nothing passive or multiplayer solitaire about it. It's all about screwing the opponent. I love it!

2/18/11 - I'm still having trouble getting past how little role the puzzle chips play in the game. Dominion's kingdom cards play a much bigger role. Puzzle Strike seems to be 80% about the purples, and 20% about the puzzle chips. It'll take some adjustment to get used to, but for now I'll keep my rating at 9, since I'm still very compelled to play this game. I can see it dropping several points if repeated plays show the game to be too dominated by "mono-purple" strategies.

RATING: 6
While I need some more plays to get a better feel for it, Puzzle Strike is a fairly unique deck-building game where the object is to knock players out of the game.  This is done by sending hit points (or "gems", which initially confusingly are also the currency in the game) to your left-hand neighbor.  If you can't get down to less than 10 hit points by the end of your turn, you lose and are eliminated.

The somewhat confusing thing here is that gems are both your currency and your hit points.  Gems in your hand are used to buy stuff.  Gems in your gem pool are hit points, which are kept completely separate from your hand!  So, gems in hand = good... gems in pool = generally bad.  Of course, there are also ways to move gems from your pool to your hand and vice versa.

Your chips in hand generally will allow you to buy more chips (with gems in hand) and manipulate your hit points (there are ways to combine your hit points and send them over to your opponents), as well as other various things.

Overall, I thought it was a fairly interesting twist on deck-building, although the idea of chips is much less appealing than you'd think.  The coolness factor wears out quickly, as you can sometimes have a fair number of chips in your hand, which is pretty annoying compared to a hand of cards you can just fan out.  But, the game is still somewhat interesting, and I'd be interested in trying it some more.

An interesting 'deck building' game (like Dominion) that adds player powers and a 'bad-point' gem pile.  Not only do you manage your deck, but you need to manage the gem pile before it stacks to 10 and you lose. Where in Dominion, it is fun to try and figure out the best path to victory given the subset of cards to buy, this game does not seem to have that.  The Purple chips are always available in every game and seem to out-weigh the deck building chips greatly, making that whole section of this game lackluster. Hopefully repeated plays will reveal more depth. It's still fun crashing and combining gems and knocking people out because the game length suits that type of mechanic.

RATING: 8.5
It's better than Dominion in that each player has a different character, which really does make it more interesting.  Direct attacks, no shuffling, the feel of the chips, and more interaction.  

It's worse than Dominion in that it can get a bit 'fiddly', (search your bag for a purple, then...) especially with the gems moving back and forth. Also, there's not nearly as much variety.  (Purple chips are almost always a great buy, unlike Dominion, where nothing is a certain thing).  Finally, player elimination sucks.  It usually doesn't take too long to wrap up, but sometimes it does.  Blech.

Overall, they both have their value.

My rating on this one is mostly subjective.  It's the best done of the Dominion clones, so if you like that sort of thing, you'll like Puzzle Strike.  

Unfortunately, I do not.  I understand that this one has more player interaction and less "run the optimal engine" once both players are proficient... but until then, the gameplay is pretty much limited to non-interactive engine building, and I'm not interested enough in the genre to go through the learning curve to get to the "meat" inside.

-Game can fall very flat with new players, especially compared to other "deck-building" games.

Me gustó bastante más que el dominion. El inicio de juego asimétrico le da un puntito muy interesante. El banco de fichas comunes, escaso (pues hay infumables que nunca comprarias, y fichas desequilibrantes que quieres tener 3 o 4). Por suerte, con la 3º edición lo corrigen. Recomendable si te gustan los deck builders o eres fan de Yomi.

This is what Dominion should have been.. but it still needs some Dominion-isms to be awesome.  It is very cut throat and deliberately competitive, which I like.  BUT, there is no end point until the final player elimination takes place-so sometimes it REALLY drags out.  Works best as a 2 player game.  I love the characters but the theme is kinda dumb.

RATING: 8
Puzzle Strike is essentially a deck building game that uses chips instead of cards. I consider this to be a fairly big upgrade, because I have friends who can not shuffle worth a damn. 

The general idea is that you are playing a "fighter" in a puzzle fighter game, which is essentially a combination of tetris and a fighting game. Your knowledge of these games is ultimately irrelevant to your enjoyment of the game. I have played tetris, and I have played some fighting games, but I have not played any puzzle fighter games, and I still have only a vague idea of how the actual video game would work. I suspect the board game implementation only has the vaguest connection with the video game version.

The game is won and lost based on your ability to manage your "gem pile", essentially a pile of numbers that slowly accumulates for each player at the beginning of each round. If it ever exceeds 10 at the end of your action phase then you lose. Note: if you play multi-player this has player elimination. When we were playing our four-player matches on Sunday, the losing players ended up playing Hive while the remaining two fought it out.

As the gem pile gets bigger though, and you get closer to defeat, you get to draw more chips, giving you more options, particularly if you've built your bag/deck intelligently. Additionally, there is no requirement you keep your stack big. There are chips called Crashes (and Double Crashes) that allow you to split one gem into a number of 1 sized gems equal to its size and then them to your left-hand opponent. They have the ability to counter-crash and send a gem back at you, and you can counter-counter crash, etc until people run out of crashes. Gems that are sent at each other are negated, so this will force the stack size back down, but if they do not have an effective defence then you can force their gem stack size up beyond their allowable limit, causing them to lose.

This is aided by other purchasable chips called Combines that allow you to combine two gems together to make a larger number value gem. If you get a 4 gem, you can't build them it up any higher, but that gem also becomes unblockable. Your opponent cannot play any Crashes to send gems back at your or play any other chips that effect Crashes.

Because you also need to generate money in order to purchase things (you have one forced buy per turn; if you do not have the money to buy anything you are forced to take a wound, which is a "dead" chip), there ends up being a constant tension between your desire to control your stack so that you can gain an advantage over your opponent and ultimately win, your ability to gain additional purchasing power so that you can get the "right" better chips in your bag, and your ability to get a good deck composition so that what you want to do is not drowned out by all the stuff in your bag. Because you don't have any truly dead chips that you are trying to acquire (like the vp cards in dominion and the like), you typically have quite a few decisions in each set of chips you draw. One of my biggest complaints about Dominion was that a lot of the hands were obvious and I could typically play on auto-pilot. Because of the increased decision density in hands and the interactiveness of the game, I have yet to feel like that while playing Puzzle Strike.

There are also 10 different characters in the game, each of which is represented by three chips that you start with. Each character has particular strengths and weaknesses, but they mostly seem to be balanced so far; I doubt 10 games is enough to determine this in any way, shape, or form though.

So, as I noted before, I am liking this game quite a bit right now. It really works for me in ways that all the other deck building games I have played have not. It feels a lot more multi-dimensional and is definitely more interactive, resulting in a game that is, for me at least, a lot more interesting. I expect to play the hell out of it. Hopefully it lives up to its promise, and turns out to be one I can get a couple hundred plays out of.

RATING: 8
Players are video game character battling each other in a last man standing battle. On your turn you add a gem to your pile, then play out your mini hand of five cards. At the end of your turn discard your hand and draw a new hand of five cards. The game is very heavily based on Dominion (acknowledged) but with three distinct differences. First, each player begins with three specific character cards in their deck, so everyone is different.  Second, there are no cards but instead played with poker chips with the information printed on them. Lastly, you are not collecting victory points, but instead trying to beat up your opponent by adding gems to their pile. You are knocked out of the game if you end a turn with 10 gems. Plays very clean and fast, and the poker chips make the shuffling much easier. A clean, fast Dominion - well done.  The wooden set I learned with looks amazing.  The new 2011 edition is stunning.

I admit that the constant redesigns and rebalances by Sirlin really soured me on this game.  I loved the concept, but one aspect of the game really bothered me. No matter how hard you try, you can lose simply by not drawing the rite chip at the right time.

Might need to play this more to see if I can see what others see in it.   The main purple action discs seem to be the only relevant thing happening.   I like that the goal is to knock out the other players, however.   Can't really say that I'm drawn back to it for any reason at this point.   The handling of the chips is very fiddly....  far worse than the shuffling and card manipulation of Dominion.

●Introduced and played during regular meet up.
●This was my 1st deck building game, or should I say chips building game.
●Having played my 1st ever deck building game, I have to say that the mechanic is still new to me, so I have a mixed bag of feelings on it.
●The game can be quite repetitive as what you do in your turn are pretty much the same, you do your actions, either play something or buy something, and then discards all your cards in your hand and draw a new one.
●Gameplay I'd say is pretty fast and in puzzle strike, player elimination exits. 
●Chips in this game were made from super thick card stock. Since it's in chips form, there can be no sleeves to protect it, hence I think it cannot last long through many plays (just my opinion). The cloth bag included in the game was made from a good material as well.
●Insert for the chips are excellent in doing its job.
●Probably, I'm not ready yet to own a deck building game, so I think I'll pass on this although it's a good game.

This is a deck building game that uses chips instead of cards.  You can purchase a pdf to make a card version instead of a chip version if that's your preference... both will cost approximately the same.  That being said, I played the chip version and I think I would prefer the card version over the chip. What's the game like?  It's another deckbuilding game where you randomize a set of cards and your decision making is based on what is available at the beginning and what you draw turn-to-turn.

What's good about it? Real choices in how you play the chips that you've drawn. I didn't really find a lot of angst in how to play your hand in Dominion (base) or Thunderstone (base). I really love the fact that each player starts with 3 unique chips for the 'character' he/she is playing. This can really define how you want to play the game and what chips you want to purchase. It also feels more interactive than the two previously mentioned titles as you will be piling gems on your opponent. When they hit 10 or more at the end of their turn, they lose. With the whole gem pile mechanism, there are no dead chips (like dominion VP cards, some monsters in TS) in your 'deck' unless your opponent puts wounds in your deck with chips.

What are the points of caution? (1) Most people consider this optimally a 2 player game. That may be a benefit or hindrance to some. Thought the multiplayer has changed in the new edition. (2) Based on the gem pile mechanism there is usually a high importance of purchasing/acquiring purple chips which interact with the gem piles. This has been slightly altered in the new edition. (3) Most other deck builders seem to be quicker at increasing their card variety with expansions. (4) My typical deck building issues and the chip thing, in my opinion, is actually worse than cards. (5) This game has undergone many editions... first wood chips, then this edition, then an upgrade pack, and then a new edition. This has been quite expensive for people that really like the game.

B&B 2011

Very disappointed--Despite the fact the back of the box shows a really neat game board, inside are only chips, chip bag, and storage tray. I read the contents over four times, convinced my box was missing game boards. Thanks to BGG, I now see there was previously a Deluxe version which I assume had boards? I think it is very misleading to show something on the box that the game does not contain. I did see very nice files here on BGG that gamers have uploaded--Thanks, All. It took several hours to download and print that which should have come with the game.  (I am glad I did, the player aides really make a difference.)

Nice chip tray (also printed out alaphabetical text strip names from the file by jimmcmahon), and the chips are of very heavy cardboard, and chip bags are a good size so that the hand fits easily inside. 

Punch out the frames from the backside--they practically fall out. From the front side, they are harder to punch out. 

If you have played other deck building games, especially Dominion, a five minute rule read is all you need. 

[b]The game play--NOT Disappointed:[/b]
With a few differences, this is Dominion, a Deck Building Game, with chips instead of cards.

Each player is a character with 3 unique chips which can be used only when drawn. At this time, Resident Evil is the only other deck building game I know of with Characters, but their abilities are present all the time.

This is an attack game and highly interactive. In fact, the whole intent of the game is to better your hand to attack others. Players give gems to their opponents, and when a player can't reduce his gem stack below 10, he loses. One player can create a chain reaction that takes every one else down. 

Puzzle Strike is just as fiddly when setting up and putting away as the other deck building games, but it speeds up during play because there is no card shuffling--swish chips in a bags and pull them out. Also, the chips are more durable than cards, and eliminate the expense of card sleeves, if that's the way you go. The game lasts 15-20 minutes. 

I like the simplicity of this game, as Dominion used to be before expansions. (In Dominion, there is so much down time when players can string together 20-40+ cards.) 

This is a simplistic game--not enough room on the chips to be too complex--and at first glance, the strategy looks one dimensional. However, if you go the obvious route of all purple chips, you will lose to those who develop a deeper method of play. 

I do not think this game is fun with two--this is a social game and the attacks are more interesting with three and preferably four. 

I do get tired of expansions, but they are expected for this game, and after a lot of plays, probably needed. I just hope the additional chips keep the game simple.

Deck Building Games I own and have played, in order of favorite:
Dominion 
Puzzle Strike 
Nightfall
Thunderstone
Ascension
Heroes of Graxia (Going to sell)

EDIT:  [b]Biggest hit of the year so far with my gaming friends[/b].  Had it less than a week and it has seen a dozen plays.

The game can be deceptive.  Just as I think I am in a winning position, somebody crashes me with gems, and I am the first one out!  Not an easy game to win.

A psuedo-solution to Dominion's extreme maintenance problems. I think Puzzle Strike's not quite as crisp and clear as Dominion (mostly the gem smashing/goofy player interaction bog things down) which definitely sets it back a few notches. Dominion's barebones theme lets them focus on what works and Puzzle Strike's zany theme adds some chaff. Plus it's not THAT MUCH easier to set-up and play than Dominion.

Apparently Puzzle Strike's player interaction is more than just goofy. Need to play this a few more times. I'm probably missing the point.

Likes it a lot at first, payed for the wood version for  couple hundred bucks.  It keeps changing, (version three out already?) and it may be changing for the better and I'm glad Sirlin wants to keep "honing" it, but can't keep up its constant "revolution."  Could keep playing the old one since I had fun for the time, but I feel like its a broken version at this point. It's psychological I know...

The thing that really surprised me about PS is how it feels nothing like Dominion even though the mechanics and even many of the chips are so similar. The fact that it's a battle adds so much tension to the game, and if you try to play it the way you play Dominion (which I did at first) you are guaranteed to lose horribly. This one has a lot of interest to offer and is definitely worth picking up. I don't know if it's because of the direct conflict element, but in my circles the female gamers have disliked this as compared to Dominion.

Damn, this has grabbed me and won't let go.  My wife is enjoying it, and I'm helping her to find some of the deeper strategy involved.  I'm also playing a bit online (mostly against the AI) and that's great fun too.
I'm still not sure if I want to spring for buying it, just in case there might be an even more complete and better 3rd edition (plus expansion) in the works.

UPDATE - Didn't go for the Kickstarter, mainly because Sirlin Games irritates me. Also, I decided that, with the tiles available, there is usually a pretty clear "best move" on any given turn, which knocks the game's rating down a bit for me.

A board game based on a puzzle-fighting game that doesn't exist, based on a fighting game, which also doesn't exist. A really nice deckbuilder, except the cards are chips that you draw from a bag. If you think Dominion and the like aren't competitive enough for you, then this is your game.

RATING: 5
A deck building game in the mould of Dominion but with direct player interaction and player elimination! Add cards from the poole to your deck, draw cards to play actions to play more cards, money to buy more cards, and crash your Gem cards into your opponent to raise their stack of gems to 10 or more to eliminate them. The rules are straigh forward, components are OK although one small issue to be noted - the game is a deck building game that uses chips (like poker chips) rather than cards (shuffles are done by jiggling your bag of chips) - I had the pnp card version to actually play as the chips do not appeal to me (hard to shuffle, hard to draw out of the bag, hard to hold). Art is sort of non-existant. The range of actions provided by the puzzle chips is limited and tends to be of only secondary focus to the 3 Gem action chips limiting replayability.

An expansion has been flagged that will fix perceived balance problems with some of the characters and improve the functionality of the puzzle chips compared to the gem action chips - pity it was not done properly right from the start.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This one lasted quite a while. But all the "puzzle" chips are just distractions in the end. The best strategy comes down to getting money, and getting lots of combine and crash chips. 

Yes, I can understand that if you are a Puzzle Strike fanboy, there are more strategies. But who wants to play the game that much? 

Finally, the game is really designed as a two-player battle game (like all Sirlin Games as far as I can tell). It works multi-player, but feels a little "hacked" so it's just not as good of a fit for me and my group.

Best dominion clone I've played.  It helps a lot thematically if you played the old puzzle fighter playstation game.  Even if you didn't play the video game, stick with this one long enough to figure it out.  There is a lot of meat on the bones here, and it fixes a lot of the issues people have with dominion!

I'd like to play again, the score could go up or down a point.  Also a little while after rating this game, I began to think I might be over-rating it due to nostalgia and love for the old puzzle fighter video game...  so I dropped it half a point.

The "purples only" strategy also detracts from the game a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As deckbuilders go, this one gets most things right. You get a character that steers you towards a particular style of play. So much so, in fact, that the neutral "puzzle" chips in the middle aren't as important. Compared to Dominion, where an experienced player must consider the setup of what neutral cards will be available, in Puzzle Strike, the focus is much more on considering what character you (and your opponents) are playing.

I like the combat elements in this game, and it makes for a fun and aggressive style that Dominion (even with the more interactive expansions) can't really hold a candle to. Compared to another x-builder, Quarriors, the decisions to make are much more interesting here, but the fun factor is probably about the same.

Component-wise, I had no complaints, but others I played with felt that cards would have been a better choice for this game, and did sometimes get confused between gems in hand and gems in the gem pile. Those issues it seems have been responded to with the Upgrade Kit, so kudos to the publisher for making it available, though again, I found it fine as is. The tray for organizing the chips works very well and keeps everything in place nicely. However, the chip bags don't seem to fit in very well unless they are placed UNDER the tray, which is more trouble than it is worth. Consequently, the lid sits well above the box, and the player mats in the upgrade kit would certainly exacerbate this even further.

Ultimately, this one is well worth owning and playing, especially if you favor "balance" above all else. It seems the designer has worked very hard to create different styles of play that have similar win ratios, no easy task. Even so, Rune Age delivers on a lot of these same things (variable player powers, deckbuilding, aggressive/confrontational gameplay, etc.) and is simply more fun. This is what gives it a slight edge in my estimation, though, again, Puzzle Strike is almost certainly more balanced in its 10 factions than Rune Age is in its (only) four.

RATING: 8
An unique take on the Dominion mechanics, with a lot more interactivity and more balanced chips than Dominion's cards even strive to be. There's less obvious strategic choices (but more viable strategies), less clearly more powerful combos, and more viable approaches in every game. The character chips greatly add to the varying strategies, too, making one or another approach more beneficial for the two players, and crashing gems to and fro makes this game very interactive - a much-needed change from the low-interactivity thing that Dominion is to me.

Puzzle Strike had made a really bad first impression on me, due to the printing quality of the first printing. It turns out that was not only unfortunate, but also kept me from enjoying a great game sooner. The good news is that the Sirlin Games customer service is excellent - the replacement chips are brisk and clear and look as good as I hoped the first shipment would, and they were free of charge (and shipped for free, too), and mails are answered really quickly. If you order the second printing of the game, you'll get chipboard chips instead of the wooden ones that had all these printing problems, so you should be perfectly fine.

I've got the P&P version, which seems better than the chip version. It is one of the bests deckbuilding games out there, very interactive and with many ways to achieve victory.

However, CAVEAT EMPTOR:
Puzzle Strike was advertised as [url=http://www.sirlingames.com/pages/manifesto]completely opposite[/url] to the "buying insanity" of CCGs. However, Puzzle Strike will likely suffer revisions which are going to render the game incompatible with previous versions.

Huh. Interesting.  It maps pretty closely onto Dominion, but the video game conceit really does change the way that the game works; it's less clear what you are building up to, because what you really want is to attack your opponent.  The use of different starting character chips also adds a different kind of variability. I doubt that it has the replayability of Dominion, but we'll see. (2 plays)

RATING: 8
A great take on the in-game deckbuilding genre (basically, games like Dominion). It's fun to play with chips, seems a bit easier than shuffling up a deck. I also like the player interaction, since you win by sending your gems to overflow other player's piles instead of just collecting victory points. It's also fun to see the different strategies built around each character and around the bank selected for each round.

Pink box made my girlfriend willing to try this game. :) We had a lot of fun playing this together and I've played several times with my friends also. You can actually play with 5 players without anything going horribly awry, if you just dig up other things to act as "bags".

By the way, printing quality has gone way up since release.

It takes a while to warm up to this game, but once you get a better idea of the strategy & how best to use the different chips, it's a terrific game. Nice & quick & lighthearted. Good variation between the type of game you play with 2 players versus more, as well.

A deeply flawed game that draws mechanical inspiration from Dominion but fails to achieve its predecessor's heights. Though extensively playtested by a group of people very familiar to the game, it seems little thought was given to how it would play among amateurs. The problem with that is that if a game sucks before you know the "right" way to play, you've stop playing it because it sucks before learning the rules that aren't in the rulebook.

Attack your neighbor dominion clone.  It doesn't feel like there is as much strategy in this game, but it typically moves fast enough that it doesn't really matter.  A good change of pace game.

RATING: 7.5
I'll admit to feeling the same fatigue as many with Dominion clones, but Puzzle Strike has a lot to recommend it. I've never played a "puzzle fighter" game and I find the theme cute (if a little wonky) but it's no particular attractor to me.

One of my favorite things about the game is that it feels like the players have a specific, measurable goal. Overflow the gem pile of your left-hand opponent. Repeat until you have no more left-hand opponents. It's a little thing but I get into this more than I get into "be the best duke ever, as measured by the values of the green cards in your deck."

The pace is far more frantic than in the other deckbuilders too. Gem piles can overflow very quickly if one or both players are trying to rush the ending. The longest game of Puzzle Strike I've played, in terms of cycles through my deck, compares to maybe a medium-length game of Dominion. If you're not the beatdown in Puzzle Strike, you need to either have fantastic control, or you need to make a change. Puzzle Strike replicates for me the feel of Magic: the Gathering duels. With mono-red decks, and having consumed substantial amounts of one's favorite legal stimulant beforehand. I always loved playing rush decks; they suited my ADD nature.

I also appreciate that the "victory point chips," that is the purples, actually perform actions. The only dead chips in a Puzzle Strike deck are the wounds, and those are put into your deck deliberately through another player's malice or your own recklessness.

One of my opponents had the legitimate criticism that because of the fast pace, a deck doesn't have much time to develop, and for those who value the deck building this is a significant downside. It's true, while there are combos in the game, Puzzle Strike is not a combo player's game to the extent that Dominion and Thunderstone are.

Overall, I'm expecting Puzzle Strike to settle in at an 8 rating for me and become my favorite deckbuilding filler - Thunderstone clocks in at about an hour for our group and is a bit past filler status. I have reserved some wiggle room in case it flames out in a few more plays.

Puzzle Strike is my least favorite of the Sirlin games.  I like I don't know why I don't like it more, as the concept is rather brilliant.  Dominion with variable starting powers should make for a great a-symmetrical game.  Here it feels only so-so in action. I don't like the concept of the gem pile.  It's one of the central ideas of the game however.

I do appreciate the chip mechanic as opposed to shuffling a deck of cards over and over.  Others in my group like Puzzle Strike a lot more than I do.  Balance is also an issue.  Puzzle Strike doesn't feel all that well tested to me, despite claims of years of playtesting.  I've read that changes were being made (Lum in particular) right up until the print date.  That's a great way to miss the impact late changes might make.  I've also heard updated chips/revised actions are coming out, which is nice, but it does prove my point.

I am certainly not a Sirlin hater.  I have enjoyed his website for years, and rate Yomi a 10.

RATING: 6
Dominion with a couple of significant twists:

- Players play characters with three actions unique to them that they begin the game with.
- Rather than victory points, you accumulate a pile of gems each turn and try to add your gems to the other players' piles. When your pile reaches 10 gems, you are eliminated.

The other differences are minor, such as using chips instead of cards. If you love Dominion, you'll probably like this, too.

Tentative rating. Puzzle Strike is a followup to Dominion that distinguishes itself with a much different and confrontational victory condition. The mechanics probably confine it to the 2P only crowd, which is fine. 

I don't care for Dominion, dislike Thunderstone, openly mock Ascension, and in general have found the wave of "me too" deck-builders to be a distinctly underwhelming development in the hobby. But Puzzle Strike seems like it has potential and might be the exception to the rule. Need 3-5 more plays to tell.

What Dominion should have been.  Quick, truly interactive whatever the setup, and fun.  Great job.  

update 11/4/2011:  nevermind on the dominion dig.  lack of variety in kingdom chips (or whatever they call them) brings this game down, and dominion continues to put out amazing expansions (hello hinterlands!).  I still really like PS, but mostly it's a cool twist, not a better game in any real way.

Interaction in a deck builder still hasn't been nailed. The nature of a attack b, b attack c, c attack a just doesn't work for me. And there's no reason this needs to be a bag of chips and not cards. The art suffers as a result, as do my fat fingers trying to hold the blasted little chips.

Not different enough from Dominion to make me want to switch over.  The theme certainly doesn't help.  Of course, Dominion's theme is really boring, but the videogame/fighting theme of Puzzle Strike is (IMO) worse, since it's kind of childish.  The chips are also less interesting than I anticipated.  Shuffling is definitely easier, but I find cards easier to handle and read.

I will admit that I can see that the game probably gets better when you invest more time in it, though I think that is probably true of most games.  But it is not different enough from Dominion to make me want to spend a lot of time exploring its depths.

In principle I like the players' starting powers, since it adds a little bit of variability.  I also like the interactivity of the game, crashing your gems on the next player.  I do wish that you could attack both of your neighbors though, and the need to deal with these attacks seems to constrain your actions a little bit.  By that I mean that you have to buy purples.  I guess in Dominion you have to buy money, but the action cards in Dominion seem more important than the action chips in Puzzle Strike.

It is annoying that the box doesn't close well due to the bags, though the insert is nice and makes it easier to deal with the chips.

I don't like the argument of Deck Building Games being their own genre now, and that comparing Thunderstone, Ascension and Puzzle Strike to Dominion is not fair.  I have not seen a game yet that felt sufficiently different enough from Dominion to be evaluated without drawing a comparison between the two.  I have yet to find a game in this genre that is as fun as Dominion and I don't think that I will try too many more of these until there is one that truly does something different and better.

38/100.

My plays are between the real version and the online version.

The game itself is a 9 or 10, it is very fresh and exciting.  The quality is about a 5 or 6, however, for some of the chips in my set.  This is a first edition, of course, and the chips that are an issue in my set are being replaced by the manufacturer.  I am glad I jumped on board this train.

**Update**  This game is amazing.  That is all.

**Update 2**
I received my replacement chips and they are in terribly fine form.  They look nice, they feel nice.  No signs of the wear other people have mentioned, like peeling.  Game is great.

To be fair, I have also ordered the 2nd Edition.

With player elimination, 3 powerful special chips that manipulate your gem pile, 24 Puzzle Chips (rotate in and out in sets of 10, similar to kingdom cards in Dominion) and 30 unique ability chips, 3 for each of the 10 characters, this is much more than a Dominion clone.  
Also, crashing gems and sending them to your neighbor is just a great, fun mechanic.  And then the more risky you play, the more power you get.  
So, between fun, non-confrontational attacks, risk management and a smooth, Dominion-derived engine, this game is truly a joy to play.  
Also, since the unique character chips are so powerful, each character requires different tactics, leading to very high replay-ability.  
***Edit***
The balance between characters seems iffy and changeable at different player counts.  I still enjoy the game, but I hope that the upcoming upgrade pack will better balance the characters while not diminishing the fun.
****2nd Edit****
The game just isn't holding up, even with the rebalanced characters from the upgrade pack.  Unfortunately, the game ends up seeming like watered down Dominion, with the dominance of and focus on purple chips remaining.  I bet this game will remain popular with the anime or otaku set, just because of the theme and artwork, but it no longer fascinates me.
*****3rd Edit*****
Wow, a 3rd edition that completely changes the game has been released.  At this point, I think Sirlin should have just started working on a completely different game.  Releasing a new edition, less than a year after releasing the Upgrade pack, that makes the old editions obsolete and isn't compatible with the old editions isn't cool.

Theme is rock solid (if you're familiar with the crazy fighting/puzzle game crossover genre) and the game feels tense like a puzzle video game. Some unique mechanics among deckbuilders.

With some combinations, there's a potential for the game to go on and on and on...

The characters don't seem balanced. Especially if playing with an all random setup, one could end up with no way to counter wounds that are being dealt by a character chip. One cannot even buy these chips to counter-attack, because it's a character specialty. 

I'm looking at the forums to see if there's a way to select characters based on purchase chips or vice-versa but absent that, I find it hard to believe that much play testing has resulted in THIS...

LIKES:

* I appreciate the direct player vs player conflict!  It is very confrontational and involves player elimination.
* One might consider it sort of a Dominion clone but you battle to the death instead of VPs.  Oh, and you play with discs and bags instead of cards unless you go the PnP route.
* Each player starts off with three unique special ability chips.  On the flip side, I'm not certain some of those powers are valuable.
* I love the tactile feel of the game with the discs and drawing them out of the bag.  
* When players are wounded more extensively, they get to draw more chips to use for the next round.  This makes more heavily wounded players a bit more dangerous - potentially!
* The conflict is interesting in that you crash the gem in your line...but you need to combine your one power gems to higher value to attack your opponents more powerfully.  With the right disc, you can deflect some of the damage, perhaps even return the damage to your opponent!
* Variability of the games is considerable as you only use 10 of the 25 special puzzle disc types each game.

DISLIKES:

* Although this may prove false in future plays as we figure out various strategies (much like Dominion), there were quite a few puzzle chips that seemed of little value - particularly in an aggressive game.  No doubt some of that will dissipate if we play enough to figure out excellent combos.
* Nope, this game doesn't work for me considering how little value/strategy there is outside of the crash chips.  Most of the other special action chips aren't valuable enough.

Totally reminds me of Dominion, a game which I didn't like. Never liked this game in the beginning as it reeks of Dominion. And then as the game plays on, there are more and more interactions coming from the players. I guess this makes it more fun but mean as players curse at each other a lot. While I would prefer this game to Dominion, I still found the characters to be a little imbalanced as some of them are clearly more powerful than others. But then again it's prolly cause we aren't using them as effectively as we should. But all in all a fun game.

It's Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo/Tetris Attack the deckbuilder.

Your goal is to make at least one other opponents accumulate 10+ penalty points to end the game then have the least among all other players. The deck building is more subtle, you buy fewer tiles, often having singles that simply enhance your goals or that will give you a quick leg up when they appear. The radical change, and what drives your game, are the 3 character specific tiles you receive; not only thematic but creating completely different strategies for all involved.

I have yet to do 2p, but I have the upgrade pack for the "balanced" characters and play by 3rd edition rules for free for alls. 

If you've ever wanted some confrontation in your deck buiilder, this is the one for you; pink box et al be damned.

It appears as though this is a Dominion type of game that uses the fanstasy/anime theme rather heavily.

The design also seems ripped from the guy who created the discs for Dominion (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/395648/dominion AND http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/395649/dominion).

Cost of the game is $60 from the publisher. I doubt the enjoyment of this game coupled with the theme will rival Dominion (even if the chips offer a more enjoyable experience).

The most similar to Dominion of the Dominion copies, and therefore the most successfull, but not sure it really works. Need to play more to see if it has more variety than first appears, as this is one of Dominion's strengths that seems to have been sacrificed here. Also the weird chain-reaction player elimination just seems stupid. Take one player out, and you may well take the next two out and win due to one person not drawing the right stuff.

Adds something new to the deck building game. You get chips instead of cards, which doesn't bother me but some people do not like. The hardest part is explaining the gem building and crashing, as not many people have played Street Fighter: Puzzle Fighter. When you start comparing it to Bejewled and Dr. Mario, then people start thinking they  actually have to build out the pieces with the shapes they buy.....

Once you get the concept down, the games go fast. Even with multiple players, it's fun, if a little broken. Usually once one player goes out, the rest follow quickly, if not immediately. If you want to take it seriously, only play 2v2, otherwise multi is fun casually.

I actually like this better than Dominion. I think its a neat theme with the chips, the bag and I am a fan of asymmetry. Additionally, the game is more interactive than Dominion in general and I like that you are also managing an external inverted race, which forces more decisions; "do I go attack or do I give him more gems?" So the game in essence is more strategic than Dominion. Most deck builders  you're just arranging cards in your hand to maximize efficiency with whatever you've drawn. Puzzle Strike actually forces to make more decisions with what you have in hand.

Who cares about Dominion when you can have Puzzle Strike? The actual boardgame version of Puzzle Strike is clunky with its use of chips. I really would have preferred cards. The bags the game came with feel rough, and that isn't a good thing when you're reaching in every turn for a few games. The chips themselves are hard to hold and view.

The game itself is known for having asymmetrical balance. And from what I would consider a substantial amount of experience with the game, the game is quite balanced. The characters really offer different approaches to the game. And eventually you'll find the character suited to your playstyle. 

The gameplay itself is awesome. Getting to create a [insert type] deck to tear into your opponents is FUN. There are engine decks, purple decks, attacking decks, slim decks, and everything in between. The freedom to express yourself is what gaming is about.

This is a pretty direct Dominion clone/ripoff, but it does have some interesting twists.  Generally short, which is an endearing quality.

100+ plays, 2-4 players

Changing my rating to a 5 as this version is deprecated with the release of 3rd edition.

RATING: 9
Instead of heaping a pile of extra intricacies to Dominion, this game fully embraces the dominion model.  It's even slightly streamlined to fit it's theme.  Less of an engine build than dominion and more of a sprint.  I make no illusion that the theme plays a big part into my love for the game.

RATING: 8.2
Quick fast paced deckbuilder that is played with chips instead of cards. Right off the bat, what I like most about it is that you're not disputing for more VPs, but rather, your actions aim to both keep alive in the game, and help you eliminate others. So it's a deckbuilder that get's around a common problem with deckbuilders, introducing direct conflict as part of your goal rather than a result of some cards.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed my first couple plays of this. The special characters are a great idea and I think increased player interaction really separates it from Dominion, Thunderstone, and Ascension. I'm not a big fan of the art and theme, but that's not deal. My only worry is for long-term replayability. The purple disks (combine, crash, double crash) seem absolutely essential so I wonder if the need for those narrows down the options for good play.

At its core this is a deck builder but poker chips take the place of cards. The mechanic that makes this unique is the steadily growing stack of chips in front of each player that resembles the falling blocks in puzzle games like Tetris or Columns. But as interesting as this is the poker chips are awkward and you can't help but feel that cards would have been easier in every way.

Given that it's a bit like Puzzle Fighter, I expected this to feel quite Japanese, but it's like the Ameritrash brother of Dominion. I've only played it once so far, but I prefer the direct interaction to Dominion's (mainly) anaemic play. Granted, there are ways to attack other players in Dominion, but that's not the game's ethos. This is just plain in-your-face and, whilst it's not one I think I'll buy for myself, I'm looking forward to another crack.

RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Fighting game + Deck-building game = Puzzle Strike.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Replacing flimsy cards with substantially built card-board chips was a great idea (however ripped off) in order to save shuffling time and improve long-term durability. It's fun to start games on a different foot with specific special abilities.

Cons: Holding a handful of chips can be clumsily awkward. The game's build comes a bit too fast with games possibly ending before a slow starting opponent has time to react. This requires an evenly matched group of opponents to be fun. The new twists on this genre of games doesn't feel like they've improved anything. 

Other: This game is neither great at being a deck-builder (Dominion and Thunderstone are easily better) or a great fighter (compared to Yomi). Unfortunately, while remaining an ok game, blending the two together didn't create something greater than the sum of its parts. I say if you're looking for a fighting game, play a fighting game; and the same goes for a deck-builder.

Best Use: If you want a deck-building game that forces the screw-you factor.

I absolutely love super puzzle fighter, so this was a must buy for me. Puzzle strike is a fun game that is a little bit too much like dominion in my opinion.

In the end this is a more thematic game than dominion, but it is a weaker deckbuilder in my opinion.

Too short, felt like I couldn't accomplish much in the time frame before end of game triggered. Also very fiddly. The chips are too small to look at nicely whole holding. Would be better with cards.

IF you like dominion and would like to try something with similar mechanics but difference like more interaction and avoid the non stop shuffling deck this game is for you.

It's pink!  We played wrong first time and second time through for reasons that are clarified in the version 5.1 of the ruleset.  Needs more play before rating.  Also needs the optional play mats available in the files section because gems get bumped around and it's critical to keep the stacks separated.

Puzzle Strike ist ein sehr ungewöhnlicher Deckbuilder, denn anstatt Karten, sammelt man runde Chips. Diese wiederrum nutzt man, um grüne Juwelen auf seinem Spielertableau zu vernichten und dem Gegner zu schicken. Puzzle Strike simuliert dabei einen Mix aus Tetris oder Bejeweled und einem Prügelspiel a la Street Fighter. Das Prinzip funktioniert dabei sehr gut und spielt sich realtiv zugig. Tatsächlich empfand ich die bisherigen Runden als "zu schnell" vorbei. Ein weiterer Nachteil ist das komplette fehlen von Artworks, was Puzzle Strike dann doch zu einem sehr abstrakten Spiel macht.

Excellent deck builder that simulates both a fighting game and a puzzle game. Much better than both Yomi and Battle Con. Sometimes battles can end due to poor luck of the draw, but that just means you can't make mistakes as much when it comes to building your deck.

After about 100 plays online at DragonStrike.com I can say that this game has awful balance. Certain bank combinations with certain Characters are insta-win. Many bank chips are ridiculously OP.

This seems like something born from Dominion. I don't really like the combat, though, since you are dependent on random draws to be able to block or attack. So, if you can't block, you're not going to be able to get rid of the damage you have. Just not that impressed.

I like this game more than Dominion. However, I am not sure if it's because:

- I don't mind that games of Puzzle Strike go a little longer, while I hate games of Dominion where there is at least one laggard.

- I haven't played enough people yet; I guess I could try to rectify this by introducing the game to more people.

- I like the chips; I'm a sucker for bits.

Clearly following in the footsteps of Dominion like so many games have. Nice concepts include the bag of chips which forgoes the constant shuffling of a deck builder. Also the asymmetrical starting chips, I love asymmetry in games. Negatives (mind you after a single play) include over importance of the purple chips. Also because of this less focus on engine building. But it does do a good job of capturing the brief and brutal feeling of a fighting game. The catchup mechanic is well done, serving also to ratchet up intensity.

Certainly a dominion rip-off.  However, a few plays in it feels much better than dominion.  I love the starting character chips and the victory condition difference.  It feels like I am actually playing someone now, instead of solitaire the best engine available.  I am a big fan of the universe (love Yomi) so the flavor also adds a bit of enjoyment.  Looking forward to seeing how deep this one goes.  The gems and crashing force buys of non money chips, which I feel is dominions biggest flaw (just go big money almost every game).  I can see actually buying the center chips, whereas I buy very few kingdom cards.

edit: This game is so superior to every other deck builder it's not even funny.  The characters all play differently and pretty much every chip has its uses.  This game (3rd ed) has been play-tested and balanced with a great amount of effort, and it shows.  This and yomi are fantastic, and really have me on the Sirlin bandwagon.

RATING: 6
Despite not technically being a deck-builder, this game really borrows many of its mechanics from Dominion.  Here, you're assembling a bag of chips with text instead of a deck of cards, and the chips either provide you with money to buy more chips or with special text that does funky stuff.  Really the main difference is with the scoring--here you're trying to get "crash gems" to attack other people's score piles to make them lose faster.  So it's got a take-that element.  Also, it has start chips that vary by player, and I'm not entirely convinced that they're balanced.

This is another one of those games that I played and mastered online but can never get anyone to play with me.

I am not a big fan of Dominion, because it is really a solitaire game played by multiple players at once. Puzzle Strike tries to cash in on the hype and create a hybrid of a flash-game (think Puzzle Quest / Tetris) and Dominion.

Puzzle Strike is one of those games that I really wanted to like. It is one of those games that has an amazing concept and tried to do something different with a mechanic (deck building in this case). Puzzle Strike is clearly inspired by a video game called Puzzle Fighter were you try to fill up your opponent's screen with gems before they do the same to you. You try to break lines of gems that your opponent sends over and try to send over gems to his side, which building a bag of tokens designed to help you do this (the deck building part, just with chips instead of cards). Each player controls a unique fighter which has his own set of chips and this provides flavor but the problem is... the game just isn't fun, at all. It's actually mostly frustrating and because of this I just can't recommend it.

In a a market over-saturated with deck-builders, it's nice to see games that are trying new things with a mechanic I really enjoy.that being said, new ideas aren't always the best ideas and where Puzzle Strike gets innovative is also where it loses a lot of my interest.

I'm simply not sold on the confrontational aspects of the game. For me, it plays way too fast and loose to have any real depth. Hopefully with more expansions and different chips this game will finally break the mold for me.

This game ratings keeps going down each time I play it. I get what it's trying to do, but honestly, why would you buy anything but money or purple chips?

While this is essentially a Dominion clone in basic mechanics (albeit with chips instead of cards - I know some prefer this, but to me it is a disadvantage in almost every way), it plays *very* differently, due to the different characters with different starting decks, and the different objectives. (Player elimination rather than just VP buying.) I'm sure it can never compete with the immense variety that comes from Dominion's hundreds of carefully playtested cards (full disclosure: Dominion is in my top 3 games ever), but there is enough about this game that intrigues me that I want to play it more. But my wife didn't enjoy it so much in our few plays, back in 2012, so now it languishes on our shelf unplayed. And while I think the concept is interesting enough that I would like to play this again some time, there are now many dozens of games I would rather play.

I have the print and play version and like it well enough. My main rub is the elimination part of the game. It ruins it as a lunchtime game depending on the skill of the remaining players. One game, a person was eliminated early and it took nearly an hour for the last two to finish the game.

RATING: 6.3
Dominion on chips, with player elimination as the path to victory. Interesting ideas on players hit/damage points also being players ammunition, and I like that each player has a custom character which modifies the initial deck setup.

There's a decent amount of fun playing this, but the whole player elimination thing as the objective is crap. I don't mind direct conflict in games- but I don't like knocking people out of the game only to have them sit there twiddling their thumbs while we finished up. Haven't we learned anything since Monopoly? I think this game could easily have been modified to keep everyone in the game- score points every time you do enough damage to an opponent, for instance- and had a much more favorable reception with me.

I fear the end game has potential to drag a lot especially if everyone heavily invests in crash and combine chips. I did like this better than most of the other deck building games that Dominion has spawned, though, and I think that playing a two player game of this might be ideal.

before the revision, the core chips (available in every game) were too strong compared to the variable ones, so there wasn't much variability or replay value.  This issue was fixed in the 3rd edition, and it's a much better game now.

RATING: 7
Rating based on three games at BGG.CON 2012.

I'd probably give this a 7.5 or 8 if the theme were more appealing to me.  As it is, the 8-bit/anime aesthetic is one that falls somewhere between "so what" and "actively annoying" for me.  Luckily, or unluckily, the gameplay reflects very, very little theme at all.  That said, I think this feels like a very well put together deck building game that I'm very interested to play quite a few more times.  I think the mechanisms feel very, very tight and well-tested and it feels like a game in which skill could play a big part with practice.  I got the older edition as a door prize at the con, but I'll probably be ordering either the latest pink box base game or the new "Shadows" set soon to get the errata and new rules.

*edit* Like other deck-builders, Puzzle Strike eventually petered out. The constant tweaking and new versions were a huge turn off as well. 

If it's possible, Puzzle Strike ratchets up the addictive quality of Dominion, and removes some of the basic problems with it's granddaddy. Greater variety out of the box? Check. Meaningful interaction? Check. An actual theme and some great personality? Double check. There's no mistaking it's lineage, but Puzzle Strike stands proudly as the best deck-builder yet made. It takes lessons learned by other games, and utilizes them to make one lean, mean package.

Probably the weirdest game and the best deckbuilder I ever played. Some original 'arcade' mechanics and lots of interaction for the genre. As a downside, I see it as a solely two-player because of it. It also means that an experienced player will destroy a newbie, considerably reducing the pleasure of individual play known from Dominion. If you like deckbuilders, you have to check it out. I don't, so I don't play it at all, as playing rarely makes little sense (and I couldn't find a regular opponent anyway).

The chips are a little funky though. I'd have preferred cards, which are not difficult to shuffle in sleeves while also being easier to carry around than a box of chips.

For being a somewhat underground game, and having the annoying problem of two 'updated' versions to muddle through it's a surprisingly solid game. For fans of deckbuilders looking for a very aggressive game this is a high recommendation.

I didn't like this one at all.  I think most Dominion-type rip-off games need to be killed unless someone ever comes up with one with a decent combat system involving dice...  The cutesy artwork and theme and chips also annoyed me.  Let the kids play this one...

RATING: 7
Pretty good game. It is a game that suffers a little from too strong a base strategy but there is enough in it that after quite a few plays the stronger players win more often.

I liked the Puzzle Fighter game that inspired this so it worked for me, however the theme was a little difficult to explain to those without that background.

Chips...hit and miss.

One of the better quick 2 player games out there. Unique competitive flavor. Needs the Upgrade Pack to achieve full potential though, because Valerie's rush is actually broken and Geiger and Midori are underpowered. Even with those flaws this is still way better than most games.

[b]Update:[/b] Now that the third edition is coming out, both this and the Upgrade Pack are officially retired. 3rd Edition is easily the most balanced and fun version of Puzzle Strike yet.

Holy jumping mother o'God in a side-car with chocolate jimmies and a lobster bib!

Imagine if [url=http://www.sirlin.net/about/]David Sirlin[/url] decided to remake Tetris as a boardgame after an all-night marathon of watching cartoons, playing Street Fighter, and eating Cap'n Crunch cereal. Then you'd start to get an idea of Puzzle Strike, which is one of the most imaginative, addictive, and enjoyable games to be released this year.

[ImageID=804318 large]

Puzzle Strike is gonna see constant comparison with Dominion because that's the grandaddy of deck-building games. But to simply call it a Dominion clone is to do it an injustice. 

One is a race for VP, unshackled by theme or player interaction. The other pits ten unique (yet astoundingly well-balanced) fighters head-to-head in gem-powered Battle Tetris to see who can deliver the unholiest smackdown. It's sweaty, exciting, and quick, and the forced-buy rule (where you _must_ buy a new chip every turn) really keeps the pressure on - none of this "buy two chips then sit on your haunches" crap. Most importantly, though, unlike [-]Deck: The Game[/-] Dominion, Puzzle Strike sees you building a collection of chips (your "movelist", so to speak) that you're [i]actively playing[/i] every single turn. That's the ticket for me.

I've given PS an '8' out of the gate because I've had a blast playing it with the guys that hang out on the online client; I've got a physical copy on order, and if it goes over as well with newbies and the folks in my regular gaming group then you can expect to see this score go even higher.

This is still rather unique in the pool building style of games. It has direct player interaction without the double luck of Quarriors. There is still something that just hasn't grabbed me though. I think it may be the chip actions. Other than the fact that the chips are bland to look at and you loos that physicality of holding them like cards, the interactions are so varied and, in many cases, complicated that they just don't seem to click with me. The chips don't interact with each other as I would like. They feel more like dominion where it is more about getting additional draws and actions from individual cards instead of the way the pool works as a whole the way it feels in Thunderstone, Eminent Domain, Core Worlds or Rune Age.
I believe I may like the game more if I played it enough to learn the chip interactions better but there is not enough grabbing me to want it in my collection at this time.

Rating drop: 3rd edition is an outright nasty "screw you" to all the people who suffered through the flawed 2nd edition, and spent money on an almost immediately obsoleted upgrade pack.

A nice addition to the deck building genre. Chips are a mixed bag (pun semi-intended); they have a nice feel and the chip pile works well, but its hard to hold the chips in your hand when you're drawing several, and the lack of art on the chips makes for a very bland looking game.
Fairly fast and action packed. I don't think it will stand the test of time as well as Dominion; not enough variety (the game hinges on the same chips every game) and awfully heavy luck involved. Also, I really don't enjoy the default 4 player game; too much downtime, player elimination, and the "circle of death" mechanic means you are strongly affected by players you can't directly effect. 2 player or some 4 player team variants work much better. My rating is a 7 (maybe 8) as a 2 player/team 4 player game and a 5 (maybe 4) with standard 4 player, so consider the 6 an average.
Despite the downsides, it is quite fun, and if you enjoy the deck building games and want some variety its worthwhile.

Wow, a lot of this is copied from Dominion. We spent downtime during other people's turns trying to recall the names of the matching cards from Dominion. I feel as though the name check and acknowledgements in the rulebook should probably have included half of the royalties too...

As for what's new; the gems building up is unnecessarily complicated in the rulebook, though actually pretty simple in practice. The game certainly feels more interactive than Dominion, but only moderately so. The wooden poker chips are a horrible mess. Getting splinters and having the stickers fall off (this was a replacement set after the first set was even worse) is pretty shoddy. Chips in a bag are actually harder to shuffle than cards, though less tedious. A few stickers were also stuck on the wrong side, miscut etc. I think we described it as an ambitious, glorious failure. And an expensive one at the £100 or so the set cost.

In essence, it added very little. 'More' is not the same as 'better'.

On the plus side, the game seemed to be faster (than Dominion).

I forgot; this loses a point for being 'replaced' by a later edition (poor form, Sir. Poor form) and another for the fact that the artwork was wearing and fading after just three plays.

RATING: 6
Played on dev server a decent amount.  Never could really get into it.  Tons of rules corner cases, which make it hard to figure out what can interact with what.  There's so many terminal actions, that when you are forced to buy something every turn, getting the wrong thing will hurt every few turns when it comes up again.  Obviously the game is intended this way, so that you might have multiple actions to choose from, and have to pick which one benefits you the most, but I still hated the idea of having so many blockers(either unplayable, or not useful chips).
The concept of improving on Dominion with greater interactivity is good, and Puzzle Strike can be fun regardless.  It just doesn't have enough to get into my "top tier" of gaming however.  Still play it casually on the dev server.

RATING: 7
Pretty good deck building concept built on Chips.  I like the Chips, and the fact that you're building a deck for some direct conflict.  Actions seem weak to put into your deck, so sticking with Character and Purple, and maybe supplementing it with one or two of the action chips seems to be the way to handle this, which is a bit of a shame.

Après quelques parties, je conclus que c'est vraiment un jeu pour 2 joueurs (mais très bon dans cette configuration)

2/5 At this time rated a 6, and basically disappointed. I'll keep exploring Yomi but I don't think I'll spend more time with Puzzle Strike.

Got to play it at Unity Games. 2 games, and I liked it, but I was surprised that I didn't love it. Would dress it up a bit with character art on player mats. 
Set up is a hassle and our games went long, but actually I think would play much faster once you know it.
I think it would run out of interest once you've played all the characters too. Faster than Yomi, because in Yomi you are still playing a person who could fake you out but in Puzzle Strike you probably should play the character's strengths.

I also wish the end game felt stronger. It does when you send someone up to about 15 and they have to concede. Or if someone escapes a gem height with a great combine crash combo. But most games end with the opponent trying to draw some chips, and then say "I lost." Yomi is likely to end with a killer blow.

Played about 4 more online. 

Grave still a very good starting character. A more basic trash/upgrade pathway.

Also, tips from other players to get the purple chips.

Puzzle Strike is Dominion for families.  In many ways, it improves on Dominion: the bag of chips is easier to shuffle, and the gem piles form a time clock for each player to push against.  There's no complicated scoring either; this is last-one-standing, and games go by quickly.  Gamers will find it a little simple and the pink anime theme can be off-putting, but Puzzle Strike is definitely the more approachable title.  Properly marketed, it could vastly outsell its ancestor.

It's a cool take on the Dominion "machine". Its coolness lies in the much increased interaction it has over the original. This game is all about the conflicts, crashing spheres on your opponents and filling up their gem piles. However here it feels like you're very dependent upon luck of the draw at a certain stage in the game, which is,when everybody is close to or at the maximum of the gem piles. 
We had games that were quickly finished and we had games where each of us drew chips enabling us to delay the inevitable. And those games were a terrible drag. Overall, I enjoy this but still I prefer the original.

It's hard not to give this a Dominion comparison, since this has the exact structure of Dominion just without having the VP/useful card deck tension, and instead managing a gem pile.

I do appreciate the different starting chips, and would like to see how different they really make things in future plays, as I'm a sucker for asymmetry.

Another deck building game, and I am getting damn tired of them.  This is, I suppose, one of the better of the bunch, but it's not different enough to get if you've got one of the others.  The unique characters separate this a bit from other deck building games, but given that the different buyable chips already make every game so different, the characters seem unnecessary.  Worse, they have the potential to imbalance the game if certain chips come out that meld too well with this character or that one.  But, I admit to a healthy dose of bias, as this game is designed by David Sirlin, whose [url=http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win-part-1.html]testosterone-laden Realpolitik view of gaming[/url] grates on me.

Very good, and possibly great with more plays, fun, deck building game (print-and-play card version). Plays very differently from game to game with the different characters' unique special ability cards and the different common cards. It is worth giving this game a try regardless of if you love or hate Dominion - a la Dominion but much more interactive as you try to kill each other. 

That is, my own artscow.com print-and-play card version. The real "chip" version is just an annoying gimmick. The chips have a nice feel in the hand, but they are not very practical. How can anybody think that messing around with the chips, which always face the wrong way, in and out of a bag ad nauseam is easier than just shuffling and drawing a few cards? - and the supposedly "deluxe" version was just a joke and totally sucked with pale, blurred printing and a box that could barely hold together.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For a Dominion clone (and when I say clone, I mean CLONE; a lot of the puzzle tokens do exactly the same things as some of the cards in Dominion), this game feels and plays very differently.  It's a fast and furious sort of game that plays just long enough for its depth, and the elimination aspect isn't so bad, since the eliminated players can still be entertained by watching the remaining players fight it out.  I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it, but after the first play, I knew I had to have a copy.

If you don’t understand any of that, that’s ok! Puzzle Strike is a complete game in a box that has the fun of a customizable card game without the marketing scheme of selling you parts of the game in random packs. You build your deck *as* you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each game. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game.

Four player is pretty tedious, but this works reasonably well as a 2-player game. The main problem is that there are other 2-player games that I would usually prefer playing. As far as depth goes, I'm not sure. A lot of the "skill" in the game seems to be tweaking the same basic build orders based on puzzle chip pool and opponent buys. The result is a game that is primarily about tactics and less about finding cool and interesting strategies. I also am not particularly satisfied with the balance, in which some of the characters seem to be just F tier (Midori, Jaina). At least Lum isn't a brainless unstoppable monster anymore.

I was really excited about this, and was a bit disappointed when I finally had a chance to play. (I didn't really think Dominion needed fixing, but I enjoyed Sirlin's articles on game design, so I wanted to try it.) I think my problem with it is that the increased level of player interaction make each individual hand of tiles more important than any individual hand of cards in any of the other deckbuilders I've played (Dominion, Thunderstone, Ascension, Arctic Scavengers), and that's problematic. This is still not a bad game, but I'd rather play any of the other listed ones, personally.

RATING: 8
Really loving this fighty take on Dominion. I've read Sirlin's articles on the design of Puzzle Strike and agree that it accomplishes the design goals very nicely: in particular, it makes the early and end games more interesting by giving you interesting actions from the start and never bogging you down with victory point cards, and the asymmetry adds some wrinkles to the strategy and increases replay value. The "catch up" mechanic of drawing more chips the closer you are to defeat is absolute genius, leading to a tension where you want to live on the edge as much as possible.

The way attacks and crashes work are great, and I personally very much like that you never choose an opponent for your attacks. You either attack everyone or the person to your left. It keeps the conflict high and makes sure that you have to watch what your opponents are doing (usually unlike Dominion), but it also keeps diplomacy out of the game, which is appreciated in a game like this.

One thing that's really interesting, which more than one person I've introduced this game to has mentioned, is that despite many mechanical similarities to Dominion (and some action chips that correspond directly to Dominion cards), the game [i]feels[/i] extremely different.  This really demonstrates, I think, how the feel of a game is much more about the tensions it creates than the mechanics it employs.  The tensions in Puzzle Strike are completely different than those in Dominion, so while lots of the mechanics are the same, the game manages to feel completely fresh and fun and unique.

My biggest complaint is that the purple chips are just a bit too powerful. Mixing in some action chips is almost always a good idea, but you pretty much can't go wrong buying a Combine every time you have $4 to spend, and you need to have plenty of purples in your deck by the end game. I'm hoping the coming expansion mixes this up a little somehow, because otherwise this is a fantastic game.

Wiped out in first play but still liked it, but I became less impressed as I watched two other players complete game. 

Don't just randomly buy discs unless you want game to go forever, or you want to lose.

At what it does, the game is excellent. The only ¨build your deck¨ that I really liked. This one really justify the fact that is a board game and that there are more players in the table.
Sadly its not the interaction I really like, unlike what other people say , I think puzzle skills are what you need to become better at this game. I want more mindgames skills which imo this game lacks. Some people told me that there are mindgames but that I didnt got there yet. If im proved wrong im more than willing to raise its score in the future.

Fun twist on deck building.  After a few plays, however, the game appears to mostly be about the purple chips.  It seems like the action chips don't really matter much.

Really keen to try more and work out. I think 

Chips are an excellent idea for replacing shuffling, but find most people would prefer card because easier to hold a hand of them.

Hannah really wants to play and I have told her when she is bigger. Every time she see's the box she says "I bigger now". After all a pink box and purple draw bags, what more could a 3 year old girl want in a game.

I would rate this game so much higher if it had a higher production value. It seems like the chips I received are losing their labeling and the bags are far from high quality. Perhaps a later edition of the game will address these issues.

Having said all of that I think it is a fine game with an incredible amount of replay value.

Oh my Lord. Bad game, where frustration is much more present than fun, and where you can lose within three turns without being able to do much about it. 
The counter-crash is especially irritating, where a lot of your hard work can be turned to rubble (and actually against you) by the play of a single chip from your opponent. Screw that.

And why chips? This is completely artificial: there's no single reason for chips instead of cards. With cards, you wouldn't need a player screen (just hold your cards in your hand) and you wouldn't need a back (just draw from the top of your deck).
So apart from selling more stuff with the box, what do the chips accomplish?

Why this game wasn't made with cards, I don't know, but the poker chips just don't work at all. They're too tiny and fiddly for what you use them for.

The game is also very short. You don't get a feeling of accomplishing much before people end up with over 10 gems in their pile eliminating them, since everyone is adding 1 gem every turn.

Havnt even played it fully once, but I really liked this game as a 2 player game. Usually I am not a big fan of those kind of games.

My rating is a manifestation of blatant unfairness, as I already have an extremely low tolerance for deckbuilding games.  You don't send someone with a grease allergy to review the local McDonalds, do you?

Anyway, here goes:  I like the use of chips, but I dislike everything else.

Other reviews with a similar logic structure:

[i]Deep Throat[/i] wasn't great, but the film stock was excellent.

I like the Dodgers because their uniforms are really shiny.  Plus, the corn dogs at Dodger stadium are incredible.

Another Dominion clone. Except this one is an elimination game so you have to attack. Interesting twist that seems to work.

For a brief window of time it was the best DBG out there for people like me who like strong player interaction. With the added releases since then, I've downgraded it from a 9 to a 6. Still very nice, but I like Ascension better in that genre now, and I have stopped being very interested in DBGs.

I like the mechanics at work here. I'm not sure how much replayability it would have, but it could be significant. Also, in my only play I won simply because everyone else couldn't keep themselves alive. They were not killed by attack, they simply died due to the 1 penance they had to pay on their turn. 

May be good; not sure yet.

Way better than Dominion although I wish the designer would settle on a final edition instead of constant tweaking.

A deck building game with the novelty of putting chips in bags...  The theme is well done as the game does kind of feel like Puzzle Fighter, but the 10-ish round limitation isn't really much time to build a deck and the overflow mechanic leading to many multi-player games ending in one player's good move wiping out all the others makes this one I don't think I would ask for again.

"Dominion on tokens" sounded promising.  In practice it was pretty disappointing.  There's a good game in there somewhere, but they haven't found it yet.

Asymmetric starting "decks" and lots of player interaction, as well as more balanced effects make this a winning combination for a deckbuilding game, in my book.

I think there is something flawed with the graphic design, as you are constantly covering up the things you need to look at.  Outside of that, the game was fair.  Not exciting.  A couple of killer combos, but it's a pretty standard move-collect-score game.

A decent enough game in which the players extend shipping routes with the aims of picking up stuff and building castles.  Rather like Wildlife Adventure, the routes belong to no one and so a player can extend any one.  This necessitates caution to avoid setting up the next player for easy pickings.  However, although Titania plays well enough, there is nothing fresh or particularly engaging in the game play.

While building up castles to please the King is a hackneyed idea, the nautical setting is quite nicely done, with shells for currency, starfish to adorn your castles (yes, really) and evocative artwork.

Startegy? don't think so, just opportunism. Fun? By no means! Pretty? Certainly not.

Probably a good entry game for beginners, but there's nothing in it for me.

A bit of a disappointment.  HiG can do so much better.  Collect shells and build towers.  Very dry.  Everything cleared off board midway to destroy built up connections (to make the game work).  Nicely produced, but I'm not sure it was worth the effort.

I can understand insane randomness in kid-family games but here there are practically no decisions to make in between the random stuff to make you interested. I felt every player would make the exact same moves if he happened to hold the given pieces.

Nicely produced resource gathering and building game, but almost entirely tactical. Card management and the exploration part add some suspense and the constant stream of "rewards" from occupying a hexfield leads to a pleasant game flow.
One of the lighter HiG-games, but definitely a step above Finca. I don't like the fact, that you play two almost identical rounds, between which the board is almost completely reset. Assyria achieves this resetting effect much more elegantly,  not only theme-wise.

The game is simple enough for a relaxed evening play, as a good alternative to TTR. I enjoyed our first play and am looking forward to playing it again. Sure the theme could be anything, but I don't really mind and I like the artwork.

Are you kidding me??? Honestly??? This is Hans im Glück??? This is Rüdiger Dorn??? Is this some sort of April Fool's joke? The art on the box looks great, but this is a very tired design. Maybe this was meant to be a kids game, but it sure doesn't look like it. But there's no real game here. The actions -> vp path is extremely well-defined. The randomness of the starting hidden spaces doesn't just make for a random setup, it gives the game away to the player(s) who land on double starfish, and 4 shells. The well-known designers I played with commented that if we started over (after halfway through figuring the game out), they were quite sure that the face-down tokens would decide the winner every time, with scores always very close. I agree. If this game came out 10 years ago, it would have been ok. Today it's a huge letdown, especially given the names on the box.

Wonderful. A fair bit of luck in the hidden tiles (and kinda in the cards too) but definitely some strategy to implement.

Though I said at the time that this might be a gateway game on par with TtR, on 2nd thoughts, the rules are marginally more complicated. 

A fun game regardless. I'm not sure how deep it is: I suspect that after 3-5 games, there won't be strategies left to discover that actually increase winning chance by more than 1% - the luck overshadowing the strategies beyond a certain point.

Even at that point, though, it may be fun to play once in a while for the banter.

Tried a 3p game - worked quite well. (Despite forgetting to remove 3x3 ships until half-way through first epoch !)  New player picked it up quickly (using handy ref cards from files section). Scores were quite close - two of us tied for first place until the bonus points tiles were added in (two tiles vs one). But theme is weird (though I treat most games as abstract anyway), shell colours rather muted (but ships and starfish nice and bright), and small cards a little fiddly.

During the game, seems to be quite ok. Little bit random, but also quick. But in the end...
The player who will make last move, probably will win.
(Not necessarily, all players will have same number of rounds) You can't really control that.

Surprisingly uninspiring design of Ruediger Dorn. A mix of all possible and worn-out ideas with a nice but somehow monotonous graphics. For another designer it would be a good game - for Dorn it's weak. For another artist it would be a masterpiece - for Michael Menzel it's so much below his capabilities.

Titania simply lacks that something. In a year noone will remeber its name.

Opportunistic game, card-driven mix of Through the desert and hand/resource management game.
Well conceived, easy rules, but not that fun. And, unfortunately, the graphic design seems to be a turnoff for a lot of people.

RATING: 7
Pleasant family game with an interesting setting and beautiful artwork from Michael Menzel. There are some nice decisions in the hand management and on how to best spend your shells - while hoping the opportunity is not stolen from you. But in my little experience, when played with gamers, scores are very close, and the game may be decided on the luck of a few unbalanced fog tokens or in favor of whoever manages to take the last turn. The components are fine, but the game would look awesome with detailed plastic miniatures.

As even its supporters have noted, the game is entirely tactical.  To the point where you look at the board, evaluate your best move - MAYBE with an eye toward next turn, and that's it.  You gather and spend resources, but with little eye toward any board position, since the board pieces are shared by all and your ability to control things are based on a hand of constantly recycling cards.

Might be a little more interesting with open hands.

Wer an der Reihe ist spielt Farbkarten aus und darf dann ein enprechendes Schiffchen auf den Plan stellen (angrenzend zu bereits ausgelegten Farbschiffchen).
Danach darf er das Feld ausführen das er besetzt (Muscheln erhalten, Sterne erhalten und einsetzen um Punkte zu generieren, Türme mit Muscheln zu bauen um ebenfalls Punkte zu erhalten, ...).
Nachdem eine Farbe komplett verbaut wurde, wird das Brett halb resettet (nur Türme bleiben stehen) und man beginnt eine 2. Epoche von vorne. Nach dieser ist dann Schluss.
Das Spiel hat bei mir nicht gezündet. Irgendwie kam es mir so beliebig vor... Egal was ich mache, ich bekomme was dafür. Erstmal Muscheln sammeln und diese in der zweiten Epoche ausgeben war fasst genauso erfolgreich wie alles direkt ausgeben oder erstmal Handkarten sammeln, damit man mehr Auswahl hat.
Müsste ich nicht nochmal spielen, war aber okay ;)

I hadn't heard of this but was told it wasn't highly regarded here. Not exactly sure why that is, as there was nothing too bad about it. Perfectly affable game that doesn't go on crazy long. Better than Abyss, which it reminded me of and gets tons of love here.

Un jeu de Rüdiger Dorn très tactique et opportuniste, efficace. Le matériel est joli, bien que peut-être un peu trop sombre. Ca tourne plutôt bien, mais il y a finalement un peu trop de hasard dans la façon de s'étendre : il _faut_ absolument privilégier les jetons faces cachées (sans ça, on ne peut que perdre), mais ça introduit alors trop de hasard à mes yeux. Dommage, car l'idée était très bonne.

VP-tiles are way too powerful - this devaluates the thematic tower-building. In the two-player game, about half the tiles remain face down because players like to be on the safe side, which is why I would recommend more than 2 players. Still, it's an interesting game that invites you to try out multiple strategies and ask for a return game if you lose.

Jogo insólito, do qual esperava muito mais, devido a ser de um dos meus autores preferidos, de uma editora que respeito muito, ilustrado pelo ilustrador que mais admiro, com um tema que me atraiu desde sempre e cujos componentes não desapontam... Há um problema qualquer na fluidez do jogo, pois o que o autor indica não faz sentido e o que faz sentido não é o que é suposto, não só nas movimentações, como também na pontuação. House rule needed, urgently!

Only played a two player game so I'm not really qualified yet to rate this game properly. 

It seemed interesting enough to diserve being played occasionally. Not brilliant but also not boring at all, it has some tough and somehow difficult decisions to take.

I really like the artwork very much. Components are also excellent.

I still have to give it a try with more players because with only two the construction mechanism didn't seem to fit very well. Either way, in a first glance, a good euro game.

Played it with three players two times more and I don't particularly dislike the game nor like it very much. I don't find it particularly nothing besides beautiful. I like the artwork and the pieces but strategy and gameplay are not very interesting. Still a casual gamers' game with some neat mechanics and a bit of randomness to spice things up. A keeper?! Still deciding.

Quite interesting, if abstract, game of resource gahtering and building on a network. Top notch HiG production. Like Finca'. HIg's Nuremburg 2009 release this is very much aimed at the family market with a nod towards gamers (hand , resource and network mamagement). It is completely tactical as you try not  to leave anything open for the player on your left, hoping the player on your right does for you.

The end of epoch /game condition is quite interesting in 2 player because you can control a last scoring move whilst denying it to your opponent.

Prefer it 2 player to 3

Card-driven, tactical exploration & buiding game. Players extend shipping lines to gain benefits, resources, VP, and the ability to build towers. Since all players share the ships on the board there's a constant threat of setting something up for the player to your left. There's a bit of hand management necessary, but repeated plays fall into a pattern of acquiring resources the other players lack, and looking for one ot two opportunities each turn. The board gets rather cluttered.

'Fiddly' is an understatement with this one - there's about a million tiny pieces of wood, most of which you're expected to fit on tiny spaces of the board, stack on top of each other, etc. Pretty confused and a little bit boring too, it kinda leaves you with a feeling that someone dumped their spare game bits box on the table and cried "Let's design a game on all this!"

Titania is an interesting, if not compelling, tactical hex game.  I can't say I like the nearly complete reset halfway through the game, nor do I like the dark board, which is surprisingly grim for a Michael Menzel illustration.  A player aid is essential for scoring (see Files).

Has some similarities with Pantheon, but routes are shared by all players. The game is pretty simple but some players needed to look up rules on their turns, just because the costs for building and the scoring rules were not printed on the board.

Titania is an older game that I'd never heard of. It was explained to me as a "German Family Game" and I generally agree with that description, although I'd put it at the upper end of complexity for a family game.

The game starts with six ships docked at the center of a map, 3 red, 3 yellow and three blue. The ships are surrounded by undiscovered tiles around them and there are various features printed on the map, mostly shells, stars and towers.

On your turn you either draw 3 cards, play 3 cards or some combination thereof. Cards come in three colors, red, blue and yellow (the color of the ships) with some cards having two colors. You play a card to put a new ship of that color out adjacent to an existing ship of the color. The goal in the game is to get points, which is primarily done via building towers or placing stars.

When you put a ship in a "build spot" adjacent to a tower, you must build at least one tower, but you can build more. Each level of a tower, and they can only go up 4 levels, costs a number of shells equal to it's level to build. The shells must match the color of the tower you're building. Building lower levels is more efficient than building higher levels.

You get 3 points per level you build. Additionally if there's already a star on the spot you get an additional point per level you build. When placing stars you put one star out but have to pay however many stars as there are towers. You get a point for every level already built in the towers on that spot.

When you run out of one color of ships, the game resets, with all the boats being removed from the board, the discovery tiles being put back, but all the towers remain. When it happens a second time the game immediately ends.

A lot of the game is about timing, and trying to get to particular spots at the right time. An opponent swooping in and being able to move ships and build a bunch of towers before you can is painful.

The game was thinkier than I was anticipating given how it was introduced. It was a lot of fun. The only downside was that at times it almost felt like a puzzle more than a game.

A great gateway game.  This is one of my wife favorites. 

Sort of similar to Journey to the Center of the Earth, as in no one has a color, all are available to everyone.  I really like that mechanic. 

Easy to learn, and teach.

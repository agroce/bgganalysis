Played it three times.  The first one wrong and the last two with the right rules.  Went over very well and after a bit of getting use to the cards the game picks up speed and is much more fun. Plus is different than most of the euro games.

RATING: 5.5
this is a great card game!
its best with 4 players very good with 3
and -ok- with 2
dew to less optional targets
very fast paced after you get the point of the cards and very flowing 
and the most importent thing...VERY VERY FUNny

ok the game is still fun after lots of time but really
flawed system of winning by shortage of gold
because you lose only one gold from every action
but you win 3-6 average

so really in six rounds of stealing by gerky you can cancel with one turn of gambling -_-
and because there are lots of anti cheat cards you cant make sure someone wont win you

so really no point at trying to bankrupt someone
thus - lowering the score of the game =\

Better game after several plays. The card text takes time to read and evaluate. This weighs down first time players.

A nicely themed game, suits a casual gaming session with alcohol involved.  Nice artwork, good sense of humour.  one big problem I see is that the components wouldn't stand up to play where alcohol was involved.  The cards are very thin, and not coated at all.  A real shame!

I like this one. It's a nice filler-style game, fun and light-hearted. Great theme to the cards. I fear it will fall into a quick rut with repeated plays. Once you 'get' the deck, play depends completely on the luck of the draw.

This game, and all its expansions, are a load of fun! It simulates a drinking game to a hilarious extent. The only problem I have with it is that the cards have a lot of text on them. When a player could react during another players turn, you'll often miss an opportunity since you hadn't been able to read all your cards yet.

Possibly the oddest theme I have ever seen for a game.  Take the other guy's money by beating him up / getting him drunk / gambling.  I can't say I've played a more hedonistic game :)

That said, it was pretty fun in a [thing=13493][/thing]-kind of way.  It's not too deep, but it's good for a laugh when you first play it.  I think about 4 players would be optimum: not too long and a lot of gang-up on the leader.  A quintessential beer and pretzel game if I ever saw one -- in every way.

Red Dragon Inn is a game whereby adventurers have finished their adventures and partying in a tarvern.  In the tavern, adventurers drink and gamble.  The last adventurer who is not broke and sober wins the game.

The game is basically divided into 4 phases each round.  Discard & draw, action, buy drinks and drink phase.

Discard and draw phase allows a player to discard any number of cards on their hand and refill up to 7 cards on their hands.  Action phase allows a player to play an action card if they want to.  Buy drinks phase is a phase whereby players refill drink cards onto other players drink deck.  Drink phase is a phase whereby players drink alcohol and increase their alcohol content.

During action phase, players can start a gambling round where players puts their golds at stake.  Other then action cards, there are anytime and sometime cards in the game to help players win their game.  When the gold of a player depletes or the alcohol content and fortitude meets, the player is out of the game.

Good points: The game is quite a good party game.  Easy to learn and play.  Sabotage element in a game is always interesting.  Every character in the game has their own strengths and weaknesses which makes every character to employ different strategies to win the game.  Players must know what cards they have in hand to sieze their chance to play them or they will miss playing them.  Definitely one of the few games I will recommend to casual gamers.

Bad points: Though different characters can employ different strategies, luck factor plays an important part in the game too.  The luck factor drawn on the cards in hand and the drink cards on the drink deck can make a huge difference to the game.  The broke or unconscious players will have to wait for the game to end before joining in the next game.

Any of the Red dragon games by themselves are a good fun game, but I think the game gets even better with more players, so you really want at least one of the other expansions to get the most out of it. (with 4 or more players = 8, with 3 or 2 = 7)

I make the mistake of thinking this is a gateway game.  It's definitely not.  Non-gamers just can't handle the timing of reactions/actions, and there's more going on here to intimidate non-gamers than you might think.  Having said that, this is a fantastic party game with a group of gamers who can handle their liquor.

Pros
- Fun theme of a bar and drinking with fantasy characters
- Flavor text makes sense most of the time
- Different decks for different characters add variety

Cons
- A LOT of reading of your cards
- A LOT of cards that does things differently at different times so it gets confusing when you can play certain cards
- Situational cards that can only be used if someone does something to you adds more reading and re-reading of your own cards
- Gambling is a confusing part of the game and feels tacked on to what should be a simple fun card game

RDI is a game of "take that" where a hand of unbalanced cards that do bad stuff (-3 health to you! +2 drunk to you!) isn't slung at other players unless you are last hero standing. Draw some cards, throw them at each other until everyone else passes out drunk. That's it. That's the game. 

This game has a pretty amusing theme, but if you took away the theme, would anyone still want to play it? Other problems with the game Stack up pretty quickly:

-Player elimination. You can be hanging out for a pretty long time waiting for your friends to finish. 
-Being drunk doesn't affect the game at all, and mechanically is exactly the same as losing health. 
-The art is cheap-looking and repetitive. 
-Cards that allow you to do nothing and sit out the turn immune to opponents' plays are often the best choice. When the best strategy is to not play, this says something about the design...

Red Dragon Inn is another of those games that is just too fun not to be played. Granted it's mostly just luck of the draw but in the end it's still fun! And you cannot go wrong with that. Besides in what other game can you share a drink with a priestess and a wizard while living in fear of what the killer bunny is going to do?

Better than "Exploding Kittens", though.

Fun out of the box or as a drinking game!  A great, easy to learn, card game that pokes fun at adventuring parties from D&D.  Takes 5 mins to teach and everyone always has fun!  If you are going to play as a drinking game, make sure you sleeve your cards (or maybe laminate)!

Almost a party game due to the theme and gameplay, but there's more thought possible about how to play, and player elimination.

RDI scratches the same humor itch as Munchkin, except that the humor and gameplay are actually good. There can potentially be a bullying problem in larger games - if a player gets attacked, and can't respond, then the smart thing to do is to attack them as much as possible before they get to draw again. But you can try various house rules to work around that.

Maybe this game would be more fun if I was more tired, drunk, or if I liked playing a character where you had to mimic the voice. I was in the game until the end, and I didn't care much for it. 
I didn't really care for the random card throw downs since anyone could put a card down anytime. I also didn't like that players were eliminated and had to sit around and watch the rest of us finish playing. 
It reminded me a little of Munchkin as far as the piling on cards to make someone do something.

I enjoyed the theme, a lot, but I felt like the game was rules heavy for what I wanted to be a light game. We spent a lot of time reading and deciphering cards, referencing rules, and otherwise playing slowly. A lot of the decks had duplicate cards, and I never really felt like my Time Mage was that unique to the other characters. I can see why people enjoy it, but I would likely pass if asked to play again.

Red Dragon Inn is a game where you are jostling for the last room of the inn, trying to outlast the rest of the competition in a game of poker. Don't let your health lower past your rising alcohol content, and make sure to have gold in your coffers. Now comes the sadness... this game is crap. You might want to just skip to the last paragraph at this point.

Full disclosure, I've played this twice, both taking over two hours... but felt like 15 hours. The rounds go as such;
1.)Draw up. So each turn starts with everyone waiting as each player needs to read what their new cards are and how they will play out.
2.)Play an action. If you have one you can play one(only one per turn) and is a main way to advance this snail race towards the finish line. The majority are starting a game of poker which pushes people towards bankruptcy.  In a normal, non gambling, round there is a large amount of "take that" whereas I play a card to make you lose one fortitude, only to have you play a card that lets you not lose that fortitude. 
3.)Serve a drink-Hand someone a drink from your drink pile. The hopes are they'll end up drinking it, rising their alcohol level up and getting them closer to the elimination.
4.)Drink-Drink the top card of your deck, more then likely increasing your own alcohol level. 
*You can play anytime cards at any time, and sometime cards based on what phase they say, throughout anyone's turn.

That's it... over and over... as you continually question what actions you took to lead you into this god forsaken purgatory.

One of the main ways to advance the game is by starting a round of poker, and is a perfect example of why I hate this game. If someone starts a round you need to either ante one gold, or play a card to duck out. Play continues to the next person and they can choose to pass or play a card. At this point there are four card options to play;
1.)Take control of the hand - In which you are now lead in the hand. If everyone else passes and it gets back to you, you win the pot.
2.) Raise the pot - Everyone antes again and you take control.
3.) Winning Hand - You take control and the only card that can stop you from winning is a cheating card.
4.)Cheating - You are now winning and the only card that can stop you is a winning hand.
So, everybody antes unless they have a card to save them. And if you don't draw a winning hand or cheating you are just paying money with no chance of ever getting gold back... in fact you don't even have anything to do if you don't have those cards as you just ante your money then get to pass as you watch other people play "the game."

But wait, each player has a character! Character decks are specialized to that characters role, along with stock cards that are basic actions(with different wording/pictures based on the character.) The warrior is good at knocking down other players health, the thief is good at cheating at poker, and the priestess heals. The basic actions are mainly based on poker(start a round, duck out of a round, raise, winning hand, cheat) and a few get out of jail free cards(Cancel a drink, pay from bank instead of your own gold.) Unfortunately the flavor which most decks add appear to be pretty irrelevant to game play. 


So, in recap, the two main ways to win the game come down to luck of card draw... two flipping hours of luck in which the start of every players turn you have nothing to do as people choose what cards to keep, then discard and draw up, read their new cards and decide what they are doing. Then in betting rounds of the game you have nothing to do if you don't have the right cards. Then in drinking rounds you have nothing to do as the current player picks who to give a drink to, then drinks their own drink. It's two hours of luck in which you have a solid two minutes of game play. I will be extremely happy to never play this again.

The game could be fun, but it bogs down with a bunch of people and really isn't that exciting of a card playing game. Reminds me of munchkin and fluxx. Not a fan of this type of event-based card games. I ended up killing myself on purpose as the game overstayed its welcome

This game is not bad, but having a player knocked out early and having to sit out while the game finishes is a real drain.  This is even worse if played with the expansion and a large group.  A player can be knocked out while another 30 minutes of game is still in progress.

This game is all about dividing up your spoils in a bar post adventures and that trying to make your friends fall off their bar stools.  It is an easily learned game with some very creative aspects.

There really isn't anything serious about it.  Just a riot.

This game has a little bit of competition but it does lack a certain grittiness that i really do enjoy having in a game.

A fairly cute 'take that' game which most gamers can quickly get their heads around.

The font on the cards is far too small for some and Icons could have replaced some of the more common effects such as +/- Fortitude or +/- Alcohol.

That said, each of the 8 characters (4 in each edition) play differently due to deck composition. It's key to play to your strengths and work to minimize your own weaknesses.

So you have raided all the dungeons and now what? Get drunk and lose all your money - of course. Played this game 30+ times with both games and non-gamers and it always wins the crowd. The graphics and general feel of the game is great and the way each character plays differently really makes people connect with their favorite one. Only downside is that even though the game offers you 2 ways of dispersing of your opponents (through drunkenness or lack of gold), it seems almost impossible to render their wallets thin.
Will probably be playing this game for a very, very long time into the future.

I sometimes like free-for-all beer-and-pretzels games, but I'm not happy with this one. It has player elimination, and it often seems to be the best idea to focus on eliminating a player. Once you have beef with somebody, which is basically inevitable, you better try to knock him out if you can. I also found that money doesn't really matter much if at all. Everybody seemed to have enough money all the time, and as soon as someone gets knocked out, his money is even divided to the other players.

A pretty tedious game.   While some of the "sayings" are mildly amusing, I don't at all understand the chatter about how uproariously hilarious this game is.   

Gameplay wise, you can see exactly how everyone is doing, so players just take down whoever is winning.  Whoever gets lucky with the cards at the end wins. 

Overall a disappointing affair, and one that will be traded, sold, or thrown in the trash can sooner rather than later.

Initial rating a 4.

RATING: 9
Drinking. Fighting. Gambling. What more do you need? Any set could stand alone, but this seems by far the most reasonable to do so. The other two sets seem to play off of the balance set here, game play and thematically. Usually someone plays someone from here, if not multiple people.

Hand management game with lots of interaction between players.  Join in barroom brawls and get roaring drunk as a D&D style character in a last-man-standing card game.  You can play with however many players you have characters for, but rounds get long after about 6 players.

Meh. It's alright for what it is, being a light, take that card game. But there's really not much to get excited about. Really it becomes a game of attrition, hitting people until they stop moving and hoping they don't hit you first. You could do worse (looking at Munchkin here), but you could also do better. My only feeling towards this game is crushing, intense apathy.

RATING: 3
This game is very chaotic and random, but not any fun… I could see it being fun with a bunch of Munchkin lovers, but personally I hate Munchkin and don’t find it funny, so I guess it was doomed from the beginning. 
Also, it is very random and if the other players target you, there’s nothing you can do (I died right after taking my second (!) action of the game…) Also, one of the players needed to take 7 damage (which is a LOT in this game), but he had a card which let him GAIN 7 hp instead, almost winning him the game. That’s some weird stuff right there if you ask me!). I know it’s a lightweight game and all that, but it just didn’t grab me.

This is a fun, light-hearted game.  I think that it may have better staying power than say [gameid=553], which has some of the same type of humor.  The gambling is an extra part of the game that adds some variability - it makes it more than just a drinking game.

Overall, not bad for a low-strategy, light filler.

A simple game, but one that is fun and humorous. While gameplay alone may not be complex enough to keep players engaged, the characters and card text keep the game fun. 
The core game only including four decks, however, was kind of skimpy on the part of the creators, and you almost have to buy an additional version to feel like you have a complete game. 
I recommend turning this into an actual drinking game if you want to enjoy it best.

RATING: 6
This is a game that was brought to my attention by my non-board gaming friends.  I had had watched the Bear and Board Games episode on it before, but it didn't leave an impression on me.  Strangely, I think this might make a good gateway game since it is framed around a drinking game and the game itself in not complex.

It's a lot fun especially if you get into the role the character you picked.  It does require the right group who cares more about the fun of game than winning and at very least don't mind take that and player elimination games. I found it important to have a group that watches the game state as to keep all players in until the last couple rounds which I don't think is a bad strategy either.

Can be tough at times to play your characters strength, and the luck of the draw determines a lot, but I've heard they've ironed out more and more balance in further iterations (and there are many).  For extra dedication, use real world drinks (21+ obviously).  Fun art and the multiple ways to win is a fun balancing act in itself, as you can choose to attack sobriety or health.  Light/medium on strategy, but always a good time and a good reason to have a drink with friends.

Nearly everything that's bad in game design can be found here.
1) Arbitrary selection of target to attack: check.

3) Cards that can be played at all sorts of times: check
4) Cards that counter cards, that counter other cards: check.
5) First of the game that is completely meaningless, as everyone bashes on the leader, with nothing to differentiate player positions: check.
6) Winning strategy being holding on the defensive cards: check.
Although it gets a 3 instead of a 1 or 2, because honestly, after playing the first game, I was semi-tempted to play again. But seriously, terrible terrible game.

Every character in the game has one and only one path to victory. Unfortunately, if you haven't played with that character before, you won't know what it is until halfway through the game, and, by then, it's probably too late. It's also too random for my tastes.

It's light, easy to learn/teach and a great introductory game.  Game play can be a little slow when moving through turns and it can be repetitive but overall, I think it's a great time!

This game has a really good theme; A group of fantasy adventurers sitting around at a bar, after a long day of adventuring, gambling and guzzling down ale. Last player conscious wins. It's a "Take That" card game, in which each player has a deck of cards themed to their Hero. It's a fun game that just begs to be played with real liquor and real money.

This is most certainly the worst game I've ever played. Its either a strategy game without any hint of strategy or a party game that's neither entertaining nor funny. I find it hilariously ironic that a number of gambling cards in the deck are titled 'this game is stupid.' Yes, yes it is.

RATING: 4
Not really my type of game.  A "take that", silly game in the same vein as "Bang".  It's not meant to be a game of decisions that's for sure.  You have cards.  When it is your turn, you pick a player to play a card against.  They either cancel bad effect or take damage.  Rinse, repeat.  Be the last one standing and you win.

Players represent fantasy characters, back from the dungeon and having a drink in the pub.  The object of the game is to either drink the other players under the table, or to drain all their gold by gambling.  Simple game - basically refill you hand, play an action card, buy a drink for someone else, and drink your own drink.  Your "state" is tracked via your gold, fortitude, and alcohol consumed.  Very light, quite funny, and not bad at all.

[b][FirstPlayImpression18thSEPT2014][/b]  There's a lot of take that in the game. Hurting other players trying to be the last man standing. There can be some serious king making for a game like this, and RDI isn't an exception. Each player has their own unique deck and getting to know your deck really well will definitely guarantee you a better stay. 

I've seen a lot of people said they liked this game, but for now, I don't see anything that I fancy yet. Will try again when there's a chance. This is a no buy for me, for now.

RATING: 5.5
Not sure what to make of this one. It seems fun enough for a quick, light hearted card game... except that it really isn't all that quick.

PROS: Nice art, decent gameplay, great humor for D&D geeks, fairly interesting with 4 players, makes for a good light "filler" game.

CONS: Price tag, it can go on a bit too long, humor wears thin quickly and you're left with the decent game play, not that interesting for 2 players, not really very deep once you learn how to manage your hand.

My rating of 5.5 reflects an "average" number of players (3). I'd probably lower it to a 5 with only two players, and bump it up to a 6 or 6.5 with four players. Also, I probably would have rated it a point higher if it were $5-10 cheaper- there really isn't enough game here to warrant the price.

I don't dislike the game. It's just average. Not bad, but there are better games out there to fill the same niche. I'd only recommend it if the theme really appeals to you.

Red Dragon Inn (RDI) is surprisingly not what you might expect.  I'm pretty certain a lot of gamers will walk by the shelf and see the myriad boxes with the RDI logo on it, scoff and move on.  I'm not entirely sure what it is, but people I've talked to admit that this has been the case with them and I'm sure it's the case with several others as well.  It's one of those games that's been around so long, it's simply just dismissed.

However, it took a brave (and impulsive) soul to pick up one of them just out of curiosity and contained within was an actually pretty engaging and unique game.  Will it blow your mind?  Certainly not.  But the theme and the hand management are solid and you'll find there's more to this game than meets the eye.

First off, it doesn't matter which box you pick up to start playing, so long as it's one of the big numbered ones and not the smaller character decks.  Yes, decks.  RDI is a card game through and through, and each big-box expansion contains 3-4 characters with a few unique properties (some inventive, some not), but ultimately they play the same.  What makes this game work is if you read the title of each card as you play it - each card is titled with a quote from your character and really gets you into the theme of the game, which is essentially drinking your faces off and trying to be the last one standing up at the end of the night.

To convey this, each player has their own personal deck of actions, interrupts, and whatever other kooky stuff Slugfest can think of, and there is a central drink deck containing, derp, drinks that affect your alcohol content (think BMI here).  You are eliminated from the game either by losing all your money via gambling or having your fortitude and alcohol content markers meet somewhere in the middle of your player board, effectively knocking you out and having all your money split between the inn and the remaining players.  Pretty fun stuff, but the game can go on for some time so being the first eliminated may not be so fun.

In terms of balance, I don't really feel that there is any here, though it may be baked in.  Since your hand of cards is unique to your character (although they all share similar cards) and you shuffle them all up, you could easily end up with a hand that's able to cancel everything vs. a hand that does absolutely nothing except allow you to gamble.  With such a huge luck factor, this may be a turn-off to some people, but the whole point of the game is just to have a good time.  This isn't something you would tournament at a con, so the competitiveness is just friendly and wonderfully stupid.

The neat touches are that each character has their own artwork even if it's the same card that could be found in another deck (except for cards that depict the Inn's wench, which are all the same across decks).  Though it has a cartoony look, the artist(s) for these games are great at capturing facial expressions.  Obviously getting the later expansions will feature better artwork than the original characters, but that's to be expected.

Downsides?  The game can drag on, especially when people are managing their hands well.  It's a game of slowly chipping away at your opponents if you're playing fair.  Of course, you can also play dirty as there is absolutely nothing stopping everyone at the table from ganging up on someone, piling all of their drinks on top of them or constantly targeting them - that's a surefire way to get someone upset and that isn't really in the spirit of the game.  The timing of cards is also in contention and can result in disputes, but with such a fast-and-loose ruleset, there's no real arbitration that can be found.

Anyways, if you're interested in picking this up, just find the box that has characters on the cover that appeal to you.  Though each one has unique properties, the core of the play is exactly the same across all characters.  This is good fun to be had in an evening with some more casual gaming friends or simply if you are tired of burning your brain in the latest optimization exercise from Germany.

I like the humorous art and text, and the asymmetry of the four characters. But the gambling component seems weak compared to the drinking component, which is better. Seems like the first player is eliminated via gambling, and then they have to wait 15  minutes for the game end via fighting/drinking in a four player game. Probably overpriced for a card game.

There is definitely some humor in this game however I think it would fall flat after multiple games.  I dislike the fact that a lot of the decks for the 4 character decks have similar cards with different names.  The decks need more unique cards to them.  I feel there are more interesting card game options out there but some people will take a lot of enjoyment simply based on the humor.  Some may like to try this as a real gambling/drinking game

A nice lil' quick take-that sorta card game that relys on humor to drive it forward, but one that doesn't warrent the box size, playmats, or price for what it is. It can also be turned into a drinking game, kudos for that! Each player uses a seperate deck of cards (which become their hand), and I found this a bit more interesting than a typical game which would normaly have one draw pile.

Kind of fun.  I imagine once you learn what your character is good at you can concentrate on discarding certain cards to draw what you need, but it seems like there's still not that much strategy.  The biggest con for me was the player elimination.  After two of the players were out, the last of us just played cards at each other for what seemed an interminable amount of time.  I think at one point we literally played 10 cards back and forth just countering what the person just played.  Stupid.

A game about being the last to get drunk and pass out at a bar. This shouldn't be a fun game, but it was when I played at 1:00 in the morning at Gencon.

I'm posting the same review for both The Red Dragon Inn and The Red Dragon Inn 2 as they can both be played as standalone games or together and use the same mechanics. The only difference seems to be the character decks.

The Red Dragon Inn is a lighthearted game with solid mechanics allowing for both casual and serious players. My main concern initially was that certain character decks would be unbalanced and quickly become favorites, however it appears that they've done an excellent job of balancing the abilities while maintaining a unique feel for each character.

I highly encourage roleplaying and each player should read the name of the card their character's voice.

Pointless, hilarious, random take-that game. There is of course no skill in winning or losing, it's just whether you draw the right cards at the right time.
 
Having different characters, each with his own deck, definitely bumps it up above something like a Fluxx or Killer Bunnies. The different characters provide most of the comedy, as long as the players get into it. Without that, it would be terrible.

Doesn't do much to scale with more players, so about 4 is the max here even with the expansion. We played with 5 and that was pushing it in terms of how much fun there is available in the game.

We had a lot of fun playing Red Dragon Inn. It's a very simple game with enjoyable gameplay, essentially a get-the-other-players kind of game. We ended up ganging on the person who won the first gambling round, which netted him a giant stack of coins and immediately painted a great big target on his back. This would make a great drinking game, and maybe that was the intent (though they'd have to change the stated age group on the box). We will definitely play this again. My only complaint is that it only supports up to four players. Expansions needed! There's not much strategy involved, which will put off players who enjoy some meat to their gameplay, but it's still just good fun.

This game is legendary in my house. It started the board game craze for me and my son, and we haven't looked back since. Out of our whole library, this is the one with the taped-up box corners, and components from other expansions spilling out when you pick it up.
Thematically, it's what happens when your dungeon-crawl archetypes finish their campaign, and end up at the village Inn, gambling with the collected loot, and trying to drink each other under the table. Don't look for strategy here, it's as thin as a beer mustache on an Ogre, but it's so much fun, and laugh inducing you won't care. Genuinely funny, it hits that sweet-spot of pre-long game warmup, fun diversion during next game set up, or post-long game cool down. There are now 3 expansions, but I don't recommend playing with more that 4 or 5 players. We've played with up to 10, and some players never got a second turn, so it's officially broken with more that 4, as far as I'm concerned.

Wonderful idea for a game! There just isn't enough here. The theme drives any success this game has. Give it a bad theme and no one would care about Red Dragon Inn.

There is some strategy in knowing the individual decks and learning how to play against the other characters (and how to adjust when things don't work out as they should). This can be interesting and fun...but only so interesting and only so much fun.

Can be enjoyable with the right people OR with drinks.

RATING: N/A
One play. One of those high-chaos "take that" games, but probably one of the better ones I've played of that category. It does an extremely good job of evoking the theme, it doesn't go on too long, and many of the cards are quite funny. How many plays before it gets old? I dunno. One thing though: I'm not sure I get the point of assigning face-down drink cards to each other; it seems like the table is going to always make sure that everyone has at least one in front of them; you might as well just top-deck it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very fun and thematic game. I'm always down to play and the expansions make it all the better.

The game suffers from two problems: 
1) Player elimination. It's possible for a player to get eliminated early and then have nothing to do.
2) RDI requires player "buy-in". A spoil-sport can really bring down the mood of the game.

Light filler game that is ultimately of no consequence. It struck me as Munchkin-lite, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It plays faster than the average Munchkin game, but it doesn't offer the same plethora of choices or even the fluid dynamics of the gameplay. (In this, you're forever stuck as the same character with the same cards.) It's a fun, easy game to pick up and play - but I wouldn't go out of my way for a copy.

Don't know that I actually care enough to play this. To quote reddit user /u/vikingerik:

"It's overgrown Munchkin, where it's a pile of targeted take-that until it runs out and somebody wins. And it's made even worse by player elimination. The "intoxication = health" mechanic for elimination is cute, but it's really just a more complicated way of tracking two life totals. I really don't get what kind of player RDI serves; why anyone would play this over actual Munchkin for take-that, or over something like Roll Player or Clank as an RPG-lite. I think it's the kind of game that acquires players based solely on the theme (drinking at the inn does sound fun!) and really not on the mechanics at all."

This is what Munchkin should have been. Stuffed with funny fantasy/RPG references, light and fun, and with the drinking mechanism it has a set timer. A very enjoyable game for a light gamer crowd.

Kind of a fun and light game of "take that". Not deep strategy, so it's an easy game to keep up with and play while people can still talk over the game.  Feels like a filler, but lasts about an hour.  Probably would play again, if everyone else wants to.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun enough for a light filler, but I worry that it probably doesn't have much replay value. Each player gets a deck representing one of four adventurer-type characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Throughout the game, cards are played that affect either your money, stamina, or drunkeness. If any reach the right level, you're out. It encourages mean, take-that action, which is great with the right group. I'd love to try it in a "real-life" setting just for the campiness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I wasn't convinced by this. It seemed heavy on theme and light on substance, with few decisions to make on any given turn. Basically if you have an action card you play it, unless it's clearly going to turn out badly (e.g. gambling card when you have little cash and no good gambling cards), then you bash the leader and play reaction cards to stop things happening to you. Then see if you got lucky with the drink cards or not. Rinse and repeat.

A light game about fantasy characters drinking in a pub.  You have two status', fortitude and inebriation.  When your inebration and fortitude meet you are out of the game.  On your turn you play an action, which can affect the fortitude and/or inebriation levels of you or your opponents.  You then give a drink to another player, and then must consume a drink that has been given to you.  Each player takes a different card deck for their character,and the card decks have subtle differences.

Plays quickly and is light on brainpower, but packed with fun.

Guilty as charged I liked this game.  Guess it all depends on what kind of players you have.  This is not for a serious gamer, it is for the more light hearted wanting to have some simple backstabbing fun.  Rather eager to see what the expansion will add as this game could do with more players.

Almost tempted for our D&D group to make custom decks for the characters.  It's an interesting thought

Lots of fun if you get a group that can get into the theme.  Good filler game for a group of RPG players that are already interested in the theme if you find out someone is going to be 30 minutes or an hour late and the group still decides to hang out until the person is avalible.

Also, since the theme is a drinking game where you don't actually drink - it was kind of shocking when at a board game library event and a bunch of kids (none older than 10) were playing the game.  Since you win if you get the least drunk and injured and keep hold of the money perhaps not the worst choice of game, but as an outsider watching it was amazing!

RATING: 4
The artwork is fun.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same of the game itself any more. I used to love this game when it first came out in 2007. Perhaps I'm an old fart now, but I find the game boring, overly reliant on luck, and I would never play it if there were other options available.

The gambling and drinking "mini-games" are quite interesting ideas, but even with those present, the game falls flat - most everything is still dependent on luck, which makes a lot of the game feel like you're just waiting on a card or hoping not to pick up an awful card from the drink deck. There's no depth to the game at all.

The theme and artwork (as I indicated before) are pretty well done and tie in to everything nicely. The quality of the components is on the lower side, though.

This game's got pretty funny graphics and good flavor texts. I could see how it would work with drinking, but I haven't done it.

My only complaint is that there's not much to it. Everybody simply focuses on the person that's doing the best. Why don't I just start the game off with everyone starting with just 10 fortitude? There's no point. Maybe this game would be better 2v2?

The only strategy I can tell comes from 1. Drawing and Discarding, with the appraisal of cards. 2. Waiting for the right time on betting.

I was playing with a fellow geek, and he was Gog doing a pretty good impression of an orc. I was the chick with big tits(I am a guy) so I opted out of the RP. This has nothing to do with the review.

Everything's fine and dandy about this game. I just wish it was better.

We played with expansion to accommodate eight. The first round Grog started gambling, and I kept raising, until almost everybody was down to a gold piece. Some other player came in and gave all the gold away as a tip to the wench! Hilarious. Soon after four of the players were kicked out because they ran out of gold. This reminds me of Uno or Crazy Eights type of card game, but with a tacked on theme. The artwork on the cards is great, and the text is funny to read, sort of like Munchkin. But, after the novelty wears off, it is a stupid-fun game, with a tacked on theme. Could make for a great drinking game, however. Not to be taken seriously.

Update (08/17/10): After all this time, why would I want to play this again? Downgrading to a '4'.

RATING: 7
1st played on 12/12/07. Taught in ~10min, played in ~45min w/ 4 players. It%u2019s more of a take-that & leisure type game than strategy. There is some strategy, however the winner could easily be decided on who gets picked on the least. It is a "drinking" game. Each player has a fortitude (20) & alcohol content (0; AC) ranking. Game ends when only one player is left with the two meeting. Players are also out when they run out of money. Players start with 10 gold & a drink card (also a drink deck) as well. Players attempt to shrink others fortitude or increase their alcohol level. Each player has a personal deck of cards which vary from stealing gold, On a players turn they may discard cards in their hand & then draw back up to 7 cards. Then they can play an action card (steal, gamble, make everyone drink, etc). Gambling can get quite costly as each other try to take the pot. After action, they buy drinks for others (1 free), & finally drink top most drink card they have in front of them. When resolving the drinking the card, they may lose/gain fortitude, lose/gain AC, or having a drinking contest. I'd strongly recommend giving this a try if you know someone who has it & give consideration in purchase & playing every once in a while.

GREAT theme, as an old time D&D player I always wanted to try this and the theme did not disappoint.  Game was good too I thought, for what it was that is and did what it intended to do, theme came out and it was fun.  Not sure if it went just a touch long, might have been our group possibly.  

There was an awful lot of “Vetoing” going on, “I do this to you and you drink for 2”, “No sorry I was distracted and don’t drink at all”, player 3 says, No sorry, you were NOT distracted and you DO drink!”  You get the idea, it was all part of the fun it just might have been just tad too much.  

Other than that not sure I can level any other negatives on it, beat on the leader is there and table talk can turn the tables but that can be leveled on many games and here it fits the theme and is par for the course.  Maybe the biggest is replay, in that desire to replay the game is probably an issue as other than the theme, there is no real draw to play again.

Deeply disappointed in this game. It wasn't completely awful, just fell far short of the potential. Such a promising write-up/concept but game play did not live up to it. (Didn't help that one of our regular game buddies analysed the characters way too fast and had to tell us all about them before we had a chance to work it out through play). It did have some entertaining aspects but as it is a character-driven game there is not enough variety in what the characters can do/who they are (may be different words but it is really much the same). Might be fun with more players? Not planning to buy the expansion/number 2 to find out.

A take-that card game.  Since I hate take-that, I'm impressed that I'm only mildly revolted by the thought of playing it again, but it does have a cute theme.  I suspect there are serious balance issues between the cheating and non-cheating characters, but I won't play enough to flesh out that suspicion.

This is a reasonably fun take-that game. It's high luck and plays pretty quickly. It has player elimination that can be a bummer, and the "gambling" rounds take longer than I would like, though. The different characters are kind of cool, and play at least a little differently.

Update: I've reluctantly lowered my rating to a 5. I just don't find this game even a little bit interesting.

RATING: 7.25
A fun game in the vein of Kung Fu Fighting, but here each person has their own deck of tricks.  A fun, light game.  Looking forward to the new characters, but I don't think I'd play with more than 4 people.  As far as price goes, I didn't mind paying $33 at my FLGS for this at all; I'll get my money's worth, for sure.  I wish the cards were a little nicer, but some penny sleeves will fix that nicely.

RATING: 6.5
Based on two plays with 7 people.  Art and concept are great.  I really enjoy the deck asymmetry and overall it's a pretty fun game.   

On the down side, large games like the ones I participated in are typical of most games in that the game often changes dramatically between your own turns.  I have a general dislike of games which feature player elimination anyway, but having little to no control over avoiding elimination really drags my rating down.  In the second game I was eliminated from the game about 10-15 minutes in, before I'd even taken my third turn of the game.  That's just no fun.

I can see why other people would like the theme, but it is absolutely not for me. Not interesting, and even surprisingly juvenile and immature, not even funny.

The mechanics of the game are not very interesting at all, but at least the game is short. The main problem is that I was just plain bored, one of the worst feelings you can have while playing a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not bad.  Fair amount of luck involved, but the skill seems to come in with both knowing who to hit with your cards and when to discard in order to either stock up on cards that will let you win at gambling to replenish gold or get someone drunk.

Amusing, fairly light paced.  However, there is player elimination, which might make it not fit in with some groups looking for light hearted games.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Loads of laughs. Very [b]engaging genre with stimulatingly rich humor and art[/b]. There is alot of text to read so it's [b]hard in the beginning[/b] (doesn't help to draw cards at the beginning of the turn).

After playing it for a while, it should be quick and fun with drinks to suppliment. Though it might get [b]a little stale with only 4 decks[/b] - maximum capacity of 4 players. Also has heavy emphasis on player elimination and teaming up. Would get very heated if it weren't for the humorous theme.

Besides the humor, I [b]enjoy the idea of multiple win conditions[/b] - take all money or get your opponents weak and drunk. What I don't like is the lack of difference between fortitude and alcohol level - since they both practically do the same thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light game simulating drinking and gambling. Its a bit odd, because you aren't really drinking or gambling, but playing cards which SAY you are. Nice components, especially the coins which are thick enough to have a nice clink to them.

The game itself is simple; although there is quite a bit of card-reading if its your first time. The biggest negative is player elimination which can happen far too early in the game.

I thought it was okay, a bit too long for what it is, but my non-gamers friends liked it enough that they has devised a variant to play with REAL alcohol.

The Red Dragon Inn is a quite fast and funny game to play as a filler. I don't think of this game very highly for anything else. It's a player elimination game, but it usually doesn't matter as the game is also fun to watch when your out. And usually when one player goes out other will start to drop out quite fast too.

I liked the theme and the silliness of the game.  Similar to Smash up the silliness hides some pretty cut throat elements.  The different characters with different strengths and weaknesses works thematically.  I wish there was some mechanics that keep people closer to the pack like "person with the highest fortitude has to drink, or person with the highest drunkenness sobers up 1"  maybe the expansions / sequels fix that.  Ran a little long for my taste because it's an elimination game, I tend to like those to be quicker.  Not a terrible game, I'd be more likely to try the sequels to see what they added/fixed.

Based on one three-player game.  What a hoot.  This game is different and is crazy.  It makes it much more fun if you actually read out loud the funny quotes on each card.  But I wonder if it would start getting old after awhile.  I wish there was more variability between the different characters cards.  I give this a seven but I could see it going up to an eight or even down to a six.  Hard to tell but at this point I look forward to playing this again.

Red Dragon Inn is a lot of fun to play.  I even like it with big groups, the only problem is that when you play with a big group if someone has analysis paralysis you are hosed and the game will take forever.  You really need to keep this game moving and it will be fun, but if people are slow the game will be painful.

is player elimination, so be prepared for the end game to possibly drag between two players

A game for a particular moment, it is take that gaming, with a large dash of humor added (be mean to each other while making them laugh, basically).  A game to play while in the mood it evokes, it can be quite frustrating to have your moves countered and then someone else gets away with their move, but as long as you remember this is a drunken night out of a game, more for the experience than the subtle strategy, you can have a good time out with it.

I don't like games of direct confrontation between more players... Especially when you play with 3 players, and two are fighting each other and the third wins easily... Honestly, it is always the case... Four players, can fix this problem, but when the one is out, it can easily come to this again.
House rules (i.e. Attack a player to your left/right) can fix this, but this game still pretty much sucks after a few times...

Yeah, its clearly enjoyable enough for friends who are new to gaming, but I can't stand this game.  It screams "I am a drinking game," but quite frankly, if I'm drinking, I'd rather play Munchkin or Crokinole or Zombie Dice or (dare I say it) Rock Band (all of which are just as friendly to new gamers).  I like the game's theme, but the highly repetitive gameplay combines with the constant lack of options to make this a thumb's down in my book.

Rollicking fun. Got to playtest/demo this game at Ubercon VIII this past weekend. Fast and furious drinking and gambling game where each player has his or her own deck with special character traits, in addition to certain cards that everybody gets. I think Slugfest has really nailed this one.

The initial release in March 2007 will have four decks. Another set will follow with four more characters. The art on the cards is fun and really suits the game in general and the purpose of the individual card. 
Update: Am now proud owner of base game.

Competitive card game where you manage three different "health" pools - your fortitude, gold, and alcohol level.  The biggest downside of the game is that once a player is eliminated, they're out and just get to watch everyone else finish.  Otherwise, the cards are really amusing, the characters are unique, and the play dynamic is really fun.

In Red Dragon Inn, you and your friends are a party of heroic, fantasy adventurers. You've raided the dungeon, killed the monsters, and taken their treasure. Now you're back, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game.

This is truly a game made for drinking with friends. Beyond that, its merits are limited.  I could see it as an end-of-the-night filler, but this is just an insult to its ultimate application: the ultimate drinking game that will actually be tolerated by bggeeks.

RATING: 7
There is enough charm in the basic idea and the excellent idea of character-specific deck to blur out problematic aspects like player elimination or the dreaded I'll-begin-my-turn-by-drawing-a-new-hand-and-slowly-reading-all-of-them routine.

Not a game I'l buy, but one I'd gladly play again.

RATING: 2
The text on the cards was complicated. You have to know what each card does and when to play it in order to play it at the right time. But it's confusing. It's also boring while you're waiting for your turn, even though opponents may be playing cards against you or starting a chaotic round of gambling with overly complicated rules about when and how someone can cheat and what happens after that.
If the mechanics and cards weren't bad enough, there's the awful theme — trying not to get so drunk that you pass out.
This is an elimination game, which I normally don't like. But I was so glad when I was the first one eliminated so I didn't have to play anymore.

What's not to love about this game? The humour is great, the characters are all individual and the gameplay is entertaining. Just don't play with too many people unless you play to first elimination (unless the eliminated players can do something else while they wait for the finish)

You need all the expansions so that you have all the characters available to choose from. Our favourites are: Gog, Wizgille, Kaylin, Deirdre and  Zot (but only 'cos of Pookie).

Amusing and fun gambling and drinking game with separate character decks for each player (lending to expandability) and a fantasy theme. Definitely a hit with the D&D/Munchkin type crowd.

RATING: 7
Really shines with 4 players. The theme fits perfectly within the game. The 4 travel-weary adventurer's decks reflect each characters strengths and weaknesses well. Although each character is unique, they are well balanced ensuring no guaranteed winner. This is a light filler that is easy to teach and plays quickly. A very different, RPG-type, quickie or drinking game!

A light player elimination game that simulates drinking and gambling by a bunch of heroes after a dungeon crawl. Each hero has unique abilities in the tavern that mirrors his/her profession.  Object is to out drink your opponents and leave them all under the table.  Hilarious!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another reasonably fun filler game, although I'll probably pick other games before I choose this one.  The gameplay is fun, varied, and entertaining, but I don't feel the decks are very well balanced, and the same few characters often end up winning.  For that reason alone, I often avoid this game, but I'm not opposed to bringing it out and getting into character for a lighthearted adjustment between heavier games.

RATING: 6
Silly party game where you need to make alliances to beat up on other players and then break the alliance at the right time so your ally doesn't get too powerful.  High luck in the card draw. Player elimination, which in a large game could leave you out for an hour or more.  This is a party game best played with only 4 people.

Terrible. Way too long and involved for a "party" game, but far too luck-driven and mindless for anything else. Player elimination makes it even worse.

I've gotten so many friends into board games with this one. It's light, silly, and so much fun. The gambling mechanic isn't great for whatever reason, it always seems to be half-pointless whenever someone starts a round.

RATING: 8
A very fun card game with great theme and simple rules, also plays quickly once you are familiar with the way the game works.

I am still unsure about this games replay value however- unless you swap characters each time you play (which our group doesn't) this game could get old fast! Characters are not quite as balanced as first assumed.

Also this games biggest draw back is a bad one- player elimination. If you are first to go out it can be 30+ minutes before the game ends which isn't fun.

Would give it an 8 out of 10 when combined with the expansion- adds the needed character variation.

Still makes it as the best novelty card game though.

This has quickly become one of my favorite games.  It plays fast with no down time.  Easy to teach and the rules are VERY clearly written.  There's very, very little ambiguity in how the cards effect each other.  
That alone adds two points to my score.

I had originally thought that the game dragged with four players.  That was right after we got it.  Now that we know how the cards work a little better it really goes fast.

Still a little dubious about more than four though.  Doesn't seem like there's enough interaction at that level and it might take a really long time.

Strangely works [i]really[/i] well as a two player game.

My favorite Slugfest game.  Unique fantasy character decks full of humorous card names and effects.  Can't wait for expansion(s).

Update:  I put it up for trade because it requires a special group of people to play it.  Mainly, those who would get the dungeon/rpg jokes and that do not mind reading a bunch of text in every card.  I still think it's enjoyable, appealing and funny, but with my family it doesn't shine.  Also, it has player elimination.

Flavor. This is nothing but flavor. You can't expect to win because the game IS trying to screw you over, but it never actually FEELS like that. As soon as you get into character, the game becomes fun.

It's a game where everybody needs to be in on the theme and experience. It has a lot of take that and there is a lot of down-time and can drag on for quite a bit. But for what it does, it's actually a lot of fun.

Usually a game to play in a close-knit group while enjoying a drink and each others company.

Not a deep or interesting game! But if you're just looking for a card game to play with you role-playing friends, it can be good fun.

If you're going to design a pointless take-that game where your result is entirely at the mercy of other players, then giving it a drink beer / get drunk theme to allow players to really ham it up and bring the fun to the table is a smart idea. And its saving grace. The money claiming sub-game is a nice twist and gives a smidgen of something to think about, because if you're out of money you die. The other way to die is if the take-that cards get you too drunk (drunkness is just a count). A nice feature is the game clock (in effect) where you must inflict damage on yourself each turn, ensuring the game ends in the right timeframe. Not just sill fun, but it's actually great fun for opener territory.

RATING: 9
Okay: This is not a game of skill, but a game of laughs and experience as players hand manage their character deck to try to be the last RPG Character standing.

Super Fun! Hand Manage your particular deck playing as a RPG fantasy Character! Gets pretty hilarious with the right crowd. I learned this in a large group game. Unforgettable! I can't wait until my next visit there.

I see the replayability potential, but I won't be able to confirm that for some time. Also, due to the downtime for a large group, if players play this without humor, it'll be a dud session.

Party-ish Game. Beer-N-Pretzels Game.

RATING: 7
Fun game, we like the fantasy theme, being old role players. Quirky cards and you can ham up the game too. Will consider the expansion as I could see this being the first or last game of many evenings.

Would prefer it if the cards in each deck had different functions rather than generally being rethemed but (mostly) identical
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Certainly not a very DEEP game, but it's sure a good filler.
I wouldn't exactly call it family-friendly either, considering the main themes are getting drunk, gambling, with some fighting mixed in.
That being said, it's still a great game for the comedy alone.  :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Only played once. Could be fun with the right group of people, but there's a lot of text on the cards and having to wait for people to draw up to 7 cards and read all of them can lead to some long downtime between turns.

Might be more fun with some drinks...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dungeon crawls?  Who needs 'em!  It's far more fun to watch the successful party get hammered after they've made it out!

This game is good because it is all theme and well executed.  The artwork is well done, the decks for each of the characters well constructed, and the whole point of the game well conceived.  It's one I could tire of if it saw the table every single game day, but it's great occasional filler that kills time between larger games marvelously.

No really deep strategy, but then that's not the point here.  If you can pull off a win, great.  If not, you'll still have had a good time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
Have played base game over 10 times and think it's just OK.  At 2 players, the game is very boring, yet it's an elimination game so at some point during every game you're down to 2 players.  Instead, we play 3+ with a rule that once one person is out we restart the game - it's pretty much the only reason I'm still willing to play.  I don't care for the game, but others new to the hobby seem to really enjoy it.  I wish there was more to the gambling than just throwing down more cards, and I wish there was more strategy to it in general.  In all 10 games, only once did someone go out for not having enough money (though I can see this happening more in a last man standing game).  Best played as a drinking game (in our version where you reset after one person is out: 1 drink for each point your alcohol level increases, finish your drink if you're eliminated, add a shot if you're eliminated by your alcohol marker passing the fortitude marker). It's a keeper in our collection since so many friends enjoy it and we do use it to introduce others to the hobby, though for a "hobby gamer" it's not that interesting.

Almost exactly what you would expect. It is a card driven game where you play one action per round and then take a drink. You simply have to try and be the last one standing. Not much to it and you are at the mercy of your cards and the other players ganging up on you, but still if that is what you are looking for, it is fairly enjoyable.

I can see how this would probably shine with four players. This is one of those games that requires certain ambiance, because of the "take that" aspect. There is just so much you can do to control the chaos of your own deck against the other players against the drink deck. I did not care for the player elimination aspect though. I can see someone being bashed out of the game, while the last two will fight it out for a bit.

RATING: 2
There are game designs which highlight the renaissance nature of "Eurogames" and playing this was akin to given a sheet of paper and typewriter after many year of using Microsoft word. 

Mechanically it tested my tolerance, especially playing with 4: turn starts with possible discarding then draw to hand limit and text reading before any action starts! I've been spoilt with the Knizian draw up to hand size AFTER when turn ends.

I'm not the audience for this style of play and suspect it is this kind of 'old school' design that put some people off games during their childhood.

Still the game gets a couple of points for almost making you feel like fantasy characters in a pub, but it is not a thematic environment that appeals to me, since I've worked behind a bar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
LOVE this game and own every released expansion to date.  

Take that card game that ALWAYS results in a fun time.  

I think this plays best with 4, but we have played with as many as 8 - that was nuts!!!

Has not made it to the table as much as it used to, but I plan on correcting that in the future.

My gateway game. Played games once a week @ work but owned none...till I found RDI demoing at PAX East.  Immediately bought all 3 editions plus the 2 expansion characters, and kicked in for the full Kickstarter for RDI 4 + expansion characters.  The learning curve is simple, drawing in even non-gamer gamers, the rules are fleshed out, there's plenty of game balance, the cards are funny and well drawn, and it makes for a fantastic warm-up or party game.  Easily my favourite game so far.

My family really enjoys the silliness and the, well, alcohol. For a serious gaming group however, I cannot recommend it for more than 4 players.  The "you lose, you're out" mechanic can be frowned upon in large groups as no one really likes to be excluded.  Late game can turn into cautious play between the two remaining players meaning the rest of the players get bored watching.

Who couldn't like a theme of drinking and carousing. It wants to be a quick light hearted card game, but it really isn't all that quick or light. 

It has a lot of play issues: player elimination, arbitrary early attacks before a leader is established (at least they don't misfire ala Citadels). Unclear play anytime cards, even more unclear counter-counter cards. 
Again not bad but I can pass.

I'm not really a fan of Take That games. 
I'm not really a fan of games that don't reward good play. 
I'm not really a fan of games where you all wail on the leader until eventually someone manages to win (a la Munchkin). 

Therefore there's really nothing here that intrigues me beyond the rather silly theme of a Dungeons and Dragons party going to a bar and getting drunk/gambling/etc. 

Most of the game also hinges upon constantly reading cards and figuring out all their effects, which is also something I tend to dislike--I prefer to spend time gaming planning out moves and interacting with others, not constantly figuring out what my options even are via increasing reading of card text. 

So overall this is a really bad game in my opinion, that I pretty much will only play with one friend who really loves it.

A charming game that is too arbitrary and vapid to bring to a table of gamers, and yet too rules heavy and structured for non-gamers.
Seems to be a perfect fit for those somewhere in between, alongside other random psuedo-games like Munchkin or Fluxx.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1st play - not a good first-play game, since it's yet another game that has tons of niggling exceptions on tons of different cards that have to be read and understood before being able to properly play. Aside from that, if you had the right group, this could be a fun game. I don't see how it can be played competetively, since it's all luck and timing. The reason why this superficially deserves a 6 is because I doubt the decks are balanced. It seems like Diedre is a weak deck, and my guess is that Gerki the Thief is a strong deck. It is also way too expensive for what you get.

Red Dragon Inn is fun!  I like playing the characters that are worse at gambling but better at drinking.  The cards are enjoyable because they are written so that players can role-play a dialogue without having to write the dialogue themselves.  The cards are funny, and the characters are well designed.

It is not a meaty game, nor is it one I'd play all night long even if I have played it all night long before.  There's too much having to know a large number of cards without enough payoff of satisfaction.

(25) This game can be great fun, especially if everyone playing gets into their role and reads the cards appropriately.

If it's just treated as a card game without embracing the theme, it will be boring, but if you really go all out with the personalities and phrases on the cards, etc. then it's a lot of fun.  

Seriously tempting to try this as an actual drinking game.

RATING: 5
How much fun you get from Red Dragon Inn is highly dependent on the group you're playing with. This is basically a game of randomness and king-slaying (or peasant-slaying, if you're feeling particularly nasty). While I enjoyed my time with the game, it's hard to say very many good things about it. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that it handles player elimination pretty poorly. There are better games out there that don't leave some of the players twiddling their thumbs for an hour.

Az otlet jopofa, a jatekosok egy-egy kocsmaba tevedt karaktert formaznak meg akik probaljak megtalalni az egyensulyt az italozas es a szerencsejatek kozott. Ket esetben rugnak ki a kocsmabol. Elfogy valakinek a penze, vagy annyi alkoholt ivott, hogy mar nem birja a teste feldolgozni. Eleg sok a kartyakon a szoveg, mondjuk olyan sok fajta kartya nincsen de azert zavaro lehet egy olyan szamara akinek koze nincs az Angol nyelvhez. Amennyire szkeptikusan fogtam neki a jateknak, annyira megtetszett a vegere.

About 30-45 minutes long, a great filler game. A funny parody of D&D parties; works best with people who've played D&D or at least TTRPGs. While anyone can win I get the impression that Zot > Gerki > Fionna > The Priestess.

Not really my type of game.  The cards were very clear, which made the game very easy to play.  However, it seemed like a good idea for everyone to eliminate the weakest player.  Unluckily for me, I ran out of money pretty early--even without anyone picking on me.

RATING: 6.5
Played this game twice now - and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Makes for some fun and silliness.  Since each character has different abilities and thus cards, their actions and reactions vary.  An added bit of fun if each person 'becomes' their character. 

The goal is to eliminate the other players and be the last one standing.  Those who are eliminated will need to wait for the others to finish, but I've found in both games they hung around egging on those who remained - and adding to the fun.

This game is about drinking and gambling.  The drinking part is pretty funny and the cards can mess with people pretty good.  The gambling part could use some work but I'm not quite sure what.

Every character has basically the same deck of cards, just with different names and a few unique abilities.  The winner of the game is also just whoever the group cares about winning the least.

If you play this game as a drinking game it might be alright.  Also, if you actually get people to act in character when they play cards then it help also.

I was very much looking forward to this game but was severely disappointed. The amount of text needed to read from the cards is inexcusable for such a light filler game. Maybe if you get more familiar with the cards, it will fly faster, but having to draw at the beginning of your round only to start reading through all the cards is a major drags. I like card games, but using graphical symbols (a la "Race for the Galaxy") is a vastly superiour way to present cards. On the positive side, the art is fantastic, the characters are unique and the one-liners on their cards are fun. But it plays like Muchkin, which is a game that I hate with a passion, so had I known that, I would not even have bothered.

The best way I can think to describe this game sounds odd, but here it goes. Player power variation in this game is very "rock-paper-scissors". With that being said, two players is not the best way to go. The premise of the game is a great idea (and results in hilarity) but the only way to make it work based on the card decks you are given is to play with four people.

In the right mood, this can be fun.  It's a humorous game based on trying to hold your liquor better than the other players, so it's a classic player elimination game.  There's a nice mix of having plenty of counter cards to make for fun back-and-forth.  Most players stay in it for a while and then everyone is eliminated in short order, so there's not that much waiting for the game to end after elimination.  Still, not much depth to this one, and the compelling decisions just aren't there.

With the right group, this could be interesting, but it's probably easier to find the wrong group. The gambling mini-game appears to be broken as it rarely results in anyone gaining any money.

RATING: 6
A light, simple take-that game with an entertaining theme: everyone's at the bar with the goal of lasting longer than everyone else -- you're eliminated if you lose all your money or if your alcohol level ever equals or exceeds your health!

Each player has a unique character deck full of Action, Gambling, Sometimes or Anytime cards (referring to times when you can play them). Typical for this type of game, the artwork and writing are funny, and you have to read the text of every card to see what it actually does. On your turn you get to discard any cards you don't want, then draw back up to 7 (shuffle your deck if necessary). Then play 1 action. Then "buy a drink" for someone -- place the top Drink card in their "Drink Me" pile. Then drink the card on top of your own Drink Me pile: these usually increase your alcohol level. Continue till all but one are knocked out.

This fell pretty flat for me after going into it with pretty high expectations.

Maybe not.  At least this was over fast!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is a blast to play with the right group of people.  It feels very much like Cutthroat Caverns but a little bit lighter and in the end I like the somewhat deeper and more varied mechanics of Cutthroat Caverns more.

In this game the players are a group of adventurers winding down in a tavern at the end of the night drinking and gambling.  Each player has a fortitude value, drunkenness level, and amount of money.  If your fortitude gets too low, drunkenness too high, or you run out of money you are eliminated from the game.  The last person standing is the winner.

The game is played through each player having a personal deck of cards that they play and a deck of drink cards that effect their different stat values.  It really is just good fun, especially if you encourage/require players to role-play their characters a little bit.

It certainly does have its issues though.  For starters, much like Cutthroat Caverns, if a player is eliminated early they are left watching the rest of the game from the sidelines.  I'm not usually a big fan of games that eliminate a player from the game completely.  Especially when this game in particular is most fun with larger groups, the first one out in a 6+ player game could have a long wait until the rest of the game finishes up.

Also, UNLIKE Cutthroat Caverns, this game doesn't have the variety it initially appears to have.  At the start of the game everyone has their own deck and people are playing different cards but after a few rounds you notice everyone really just has the same cards.  I looked through my deck after I was eliminated and there wasn't more than 1 or 2 kind of unique cards in the whole deck compared to what else I saw played.  Also, my one play with this was with a collection of all the Red Dragon Inn stuff released so far (of which there is a lot) and I played one of the basic characters.  The advanced characters are a little more fun (one is a paladin that gains or loses piety which affects her cards, one is a bunny that changes mood which affects their cards, one is a potion brewer that gets a potion each turn to use or sell, etc.)  Playing with one of the basic characters is less fun when you see other players using these much more varied characters.

This game scratches the exact same itch that Munchkin scratches, which is to say I'll play this sporadically and only if someone else actively is pushing us to play it.

A drinking game that does not actually involve drinking!  The theme of this game is great and the cards are hilarious!  Just be sure, when you are playing, that you actually read the cards' titles out as you play them especially "I Don't Think So!".   There are so many characters to play that the replayability is huge.  And the designers did a great job of making each character feel unique.

There are rather a lot of positive things to say about this game, considering I rate it 5.5/10.  What struck me first is that the theme is a lot of fun, and the artwork matches the fun theme and is very well done.  The fact that each character has a different hand of cards and therefore plays slightly differently is a neat feature, although this seems to be a bit of an illusions since a lot of the cards end up doing much the same thing.  And here is where the game sort of fall apart for me.  I just find that there are very few interesting decisions to make, and even as an "experience" game it is rather boring.  Unless you were to turn it into an actually drinking game and take a drink each time you gain an alcohol point - then you might be having a bit of fun by the time the game was nearing its conclusion!  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

RATING: 5
A mean take that game. Fun art. Meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
More strategy than I expected, though that really isn't the point: the art is fun and the cards very strongly themed. That's what the game is all about. The halfling says "Has anyone seen my mug of poison?" and chooses a player to lose 3 health; the swordswoman can avoid a strong drink by using it to polish her armour. If you read the cards out loud -- i.e., if you actually roleplay -- it's great fun.

Based on that sentence and my rating, you can safely assume that I hate fun. But no, my problem is just that the game outstays its welcome. It's just a little bit too random to go as long as it does, and the player elimination doesn't help.

RATING: 5
[Slugfest Games 07 edition] {Beer&Pretzel, fantasy; utility cards; optimal 4p} The D&D theme and variable-player-power system attracts me.  It's thematic, fun and interactive. It has limited tactical options and is highly luck-driven. It is quite random - take it or leave it.  It will be a very good filler for D&D fans; however, it becomes mediocre if players do not enjoy the theme. They should allow for more players (6-8 players) but it seems down time would be a problem.  Replayability is fine because players can choose different role each game; however, the fresh could still rapidly wears out because the variety of each character is little.  The only minus is that it may drag quite long.

The components are nicely illustrated.  Game experience would be better if the publisher provides plastic coins. The box is horribly larger than necessary.

Could be a pretty good drinking game for the right crowd on the right occassion. The potential to switch real drinks for alcohol points is too great an opportunity to miss.

I strongly recommend this variant which add more bluffing and tactics to the drink cards (possibly  rising to an 8 for some right-minded groups).

1) The 'Drink' Phase takes place before the 'Buy Drink' phase.

2) During the 'Buy Drink' phase you can look at the top Drink card from the Drink Deck before placing it on any 'Drink Me' pile (including your own).
 
3) In the 'Drink' phase you can either drink your top drink as per the normal game or switch it unseen for the top card of someone elses 'Drink Me' pile and drink that one instead. If the card you choose is a chaser the second card must be taken from your own 'Drink Me' pile as per normal.

I have played twice now and both games were amusing.  Don't expect to win due to tons of strategy though - any plan you might have can be quickly shot down and you will find yourself out of the game.  More fun due to the dialogue and smack talk it generates than due to the game itself.

Let me just say this, I really dislike munchkin.  There's alot more game here than munchkin.  Now don't get me wrong this is a beer and pretzels filler game to the extreme, it is however amusing, but there is replayability here.  This is a fun theme game with heavy simplicity, its easy to pull others in and have a good time while doing it.  The game really is mean spirited "you bastard" and "stab your neighbor" at its core.  One of the great things about it is the characters individuality.  Each deck has strength and weakness, the rogue is good with gambling, the mage is a jack of all trades, the warrior has fortitude and so on.  The game itself would make a great drinking game or a game to play at a pub, and maybe that was the intent.

All and all it was good filler fun, some great laughs were had.  Definitely going to pick up the expansion because more players are totally needed.

Great theme, interesting cards, and good artwork.  However, game is essentially a luck-fest with minimal strategy.  Still, fun as an occasional filler when you want something that's easy to play.

I'm not sure how to rate games such as this.  There is a huge "take that" component that pretty much defines the game.  The reason it's hard for me to rate them is that sometimes they can be hilarious, and sometimes they can be the very definition of arbitrary.  Arbitrary games have to be uproariously funny and entertaining to get a good rating from me, and this one is merely funny.

One of my favorite party games - nobody in my many gaming groups has disliked this game, as it plays fairly fast and we all understand how it works. Very light-hearted (I never feel bad about getting sent under the table) and funny, it somehow manages to capture a tavern's chaos without being clumsy. A group favorite.

Yes, it is better with drinking, but even without, I enjoy it. It's not an all the time game, but it does travel with me when going to a party and does come off the shelf occasionally. Also, priestess is OP

RATING: 6
A fairly simple "take-that" game with two main innovations. The first is that rather than just taking damage as happens in most take-that games, players gain drunkenness points while losing stamina - opposite ends on the same track. When the two counters converge the player passes out and is booted from the inn. This is a little twist that works well. The other wrinkle is that players also may be eliminated (exiled from the inn) when they run out of money, which also can be affected with take-that-style cards and gambling. With two areas to watch (drunkeness and money), the game is a little more interesting. Red Dragon Inn also is rich with theme, and the player decks are asymmetrical with while Red Dragon Inn isn't a game that I like well enough to keep in my game collection, it's definitely fun enough that I'd gladly play if someone requests it. One of the best-implemented take-that games I've played, ranking up there with a select few games in this genre I enjoy like Bang!

A take-that filler game.  The theme is designed for those who have played D&D.  They go for humor with the art and the titles of the cards.  If someone doesn't have a D&D background, I imagine this humor would fall flat.  Because of that, it won't appeal to everyone.

RATING: 5.5
This is a game where the first session spoiled the experience to me. Why that is? Because this is a game where you have to be familiar with what cards there are in a) your deck and b) the deck of your opponents. We knew rules, but didn't have any clue as to what cards there are. So there was times when my fellow gamers played cards making me think "Holy shit, these are great cards. Wish I had some of those ..." Had I known there were cards with these powerful effects I might have considered playing it a little differently. 
Well other than that there is a decent card game in here.

Very Munchkin-esque.
It's nice how this game never feels one-sided because the decks are fairly well balanced.
The rules are a little tricky at times and it's easy to overlook an important condition.

UPDATE:
The base game still fairs pretty well against the newer stuff, but you really need to play your cards right since there's a slight power creep.

This is a fun game, the decks are funny to play and with all the expansions that have come out since there are tons upon tons of cards that you can play with. The theme is really evident and the game play works well. I have seen this game kind of bomb from time to time though simply by overextending the number of people playing it, it maxes out at six, so don't try for more.

Interesting bar room theme. The characters seem well balanced, the only exception being the sneak. On many plays with four people he seems to win more often than not.

Such a neat "take that" card game.  Four different decks, which have their own strengths and weakness.  Quite a bizarre theme.  I kept picturing the group from lord of the rings doing shooters at the bar.  Its a fun, filler, with plenty of take that.  Its quick, and easy to get into.  I am not sure how often I will recommend it, but if someone else wants to play I would sign up no problem.

Its one of the better "take that" card games I have played, I'm just not always in the mood for a "take that" card game.

In Red Dragon Inn, you and your friends are a party of heroic, fantasy adventurers. You've raided the dungeon, killed the monsters, and taken their treasure. Now you're back, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game.

Chaotic card game centered around a fantasy drinking theme. Reminiscent of collectible card games and my only play suggested a game that was fairly luck-driven. The "take-that" mechanisms and cards could be a turn-off at times. Best suited for a crowd wanting a light almost party-type game - I'd say combine it with a real drinking environment but I'm not sure how the cards would hold up to inevitable drunken spillage.

This is base game but you do not need it to play with the expansion decks.

The game can be a bit confusing at first and some of the cards have to be walked through slowly or effects need a Google search to be clarified, but it's still fun as long as you buy into it. This game isn't huge in strategy but if you flavour it as you just came from an adventure it's a blast. You definitely need a group who don't mind a game that is just for fun.

While I did like the this base game I know it had its faults and a lot of the outcomes depends on luck. 

Please note this game gets a lot better everything after the 3rd expansion and the small ally packs.

This is probably one of my favorite games on this site.  Whether you're playing a simple 3-4 player game or a frantic 10+ player game (I can't wait to try a 14 player game with the new expansions!), it's great fun.

This is one of those games that really has it all-- simple mechanics, incredibly balanced, great player interaction, always interesting, and always fun.  It's actually amazing that the game is now up to 14 characters and no one character feels stronger than the other (well, except for maybe Eve...).

This is one of those games I am always up to play with friends and it just never really gets old because there are so many different characters to play that all feel different.  If I had to pick a favorite expansion, it would probably be Red Dragon Inn 2 for Dimli and Gog, but they're all worth it.

I enjoy the future expansions more, which add some subtle mechanics that at least require a modicum of thought to your playing.  The base game's character are pretty dull.  I'd go for the expansions if you're more of a gamer.

Hardly the most strategic game in the world, but fun nonetheless.  One of the better 'screw your neighbor and read the jokes on the cards' games.  This one knows what it is, and makes screw your neighbor the ONLY part of the game by making this last man standing with a little bit of luck.  At least there's no pretensions to being a constructive game by trying to reach level 10 or collecting carrots.  The gambling minigame is interesting, if chaotic.  Probably worth it to get [gameid=33451] as well if you're interested in this game, as it seems to work better with more players.  Make sure you change the rules to discard and draw at the end of your turn to speed up the game significantly.

Probably best when played with 6-8 players.  It provides enough chaos to keep one person from being picked on yet is small enough that the gambling rounds aren't too long/confusing.

The base game is incredibly easy to use and easy to get people into.  After they've played a game then I'll typically introduce the expansion characters which come with their own extra dynamics.

The game itself is very tongue-n-cheek (tongue in cheek?) and I've found it more enjoyable if you read cards using sarcasm and light-hearted humor.

Fun but does require a crowd that is somewhat open to rpg's.  If people aren't familiar with DnD or other tabletop games then I typically go with a different, less thematic game.

Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don't forget to keep an eye on your Gold. If you run out, you'll have to spend the night in the stables.

RATING: 5
A card game about what happens after a group of adventurers return from a successful Dungeon delve. They drink! Each player gets a unique deck based on a common fantasy archetype. The goal of the game is to be the last man standing, thereby taking home all of the loot. Player's accomplish this by gambling, stealing, and drinking the other adventurers under the table. Each character has player mat which tracks the level of two stats, stamina (20) and sobriety (0)...If these two stats ever meet, the character passes out and is out of the game. Players can also be eliminated by going broke and being unable to buy drinks or gamble, so it certainly pays to keep an eye on the sticky fingered rogue!

The game can be lot of fun in a large group. The decks are all completely different, with varying strengths and weaknesses and the characters all behave as you might expect. The fighter can take piles of damage, The thief will rob you blind and the Priestess can drink all night without getting drunk. It won't make or break your game night, but you could do a lot worse for a filler or warm-up game. Additional decks are coming, so this looks as if it might be developing into a pretty solid party game as well.

Only played this 8-player with the first 2 sets.

I think a conversation I had with a friend after this about sums it up:

Me: "In the category of 'Sort of party games that have enough strategy that you have to pay attention but not so much that it actually matters', this is probably about the best one I've played."
Him: "Yeah - I wouldn't ask for it, or tell anyone I know they should buy it, but I'd be willing to play it."
Me: "I would tell one friend to buy it - he'll love the theme, and it will hopefully get me out of playing Munchkin next time."
Him: "Ah. Yes, that would be an excellent reason to buy this."

At the very least, this seems to be better than its closest relative, Munchkin. You rarely have a hand that is entirely useless, and if you do, you can discard it all for a new one on your next turn. The character choices are mostly the same with only minor differences in focus. It takes a little longer than it should to finish, but it feels like it takes a lot longer when you've been eliminated early on.

Each player chooses a hero. Heroes have slightly asymmetrical cards in their decks but mostly are the same. There is simply not enough variety between the decks for any replay value, even if you buy several sets. Every game will be nearly identical. Each player takes random damage on their turn targetted damage when other players choose to pick on them. Player elimination makes the game not fun. Eliminated players could be out for over an hour watching other players slowly pick away at each other.

4 after 1 play.

Bland game revolving around attacking the current leader. Also includes player elimination which reduces the fun factor further.

The Bookshelf Games' video review made me buy this, but it was something I tired of quickly. The theme is great, but the gameplay doesn't match.

Before you play the game:

1. Sleeve everything.
2. Get some alcohol. whenever the game states you have to drink, take a shot
3. ????
4. PROFIT!

"Five of a kind.  Does that mean I win?"  This game is a hilarious filler for any RPG fan.

It's a nice game, fun to play with your friends. it's good enough that I'm interested in buying the expansions but not enough for me to actually take the time and money to buy the expansions.... if that makes any sense... Anyway have fun playing the game.

There is a very fun theme and some laughs to be had with this Beer & Pretzels game... but it tends to overstay its welcome and I'm not that big a fan of games with player elimination.  If there were more opportunities to combo cards for some more interesting effects I'm sure I would like it more.

Quickly became one of my groups all time favorite light games.  Really looking forward to future expansions to add to the number of players.

A very fun, light party game. The more into the roles you get the more fun it is. Easy to teach, and always a hit with our newbie gamer friends.

Silly and humorous.  I can appreciate the game for what it is, but the specific personality and play style for each character also acts as a handicap.  As the thief my hand of cards was inundated with gambling actions, which means that my turn always seem to resolve the same way, and that gets deathly boring if the game takes too long to finish.

The drinking events and rules are pretty confusing, especially in regards to the timing of how things are triggered, even to those that played it before.  It's fun for a bit, but definitely can wear out its welcome very quickly.

Why would I play a game about drinking and gambling instead of just drinking and gambling?

The original Red Dragon Inn is great for having gotten this wonderful series started, but in my opinion it is one of the weakest of the series (I give it an 8, whereas almost all other versions got a 9 or 10 from me).

For me, the biggest issue is that the characters are too narrow in their abilities and just don't really stand up well against the rest of the cast, who are much more balanced. Fiona is supposed to be a "heavy hitter", but thanks to "power creep" her attacks are kind of weak compared to some of the later characters, negating basically her only strong point. Deirdre has all these healing cards to help keep her alive, but that's about all she can do, and eventually those cards run out...

Then there's Gerki, who is admittedly one of the most memorable characters from the entire series, but the reason for that is because he is probably the most broken character in the game. There is really only one way to play him: gamble gamble gamble and just try to take everyone's gold before they knock you out. Well guess what, anyone who knows what he's trying to do will do just that: knock him out! So it's not really fun playing with/against him, because the game basically turns into "everyone gang up on Gerki, then play normally once he's gone".

Zot, in my opinion, is the only one who has stood the test of time and can still put up a fight against anyone else in the game because he can gamble, defend himself, and dish out some damage. However, even he has been diminished because they went and took the best thing about him and made Pooky into his own character!

Basically, if I had to come up with a top 10 list of RDI characters, I don't think any of the original four would be on it. If I had to expand that to a top 20, maybe Zot would sneak in near the bottom, but that's about it.

So, it was a great effort to get this series going, but the creators have really figured out character design and have made much better characters since this. If you don't own any Red Dragon Inn games, I would actually recommend getting RDI2 or RDI3 as your first game, since the characters are so much better/fun in those versions. But of course, this is still a solid game to play, and a great addition for a larger RDI collection.

In the series of Kung Fu Fighting game engine, this is the most perfect fit.  The effort put into having each character's own thematic deck and appropriate illustrations lends greatly to the immersion.

A fun 'chill-out' or 'warm-up' game. Simple rules allow for quick 'learn-as-you-play' with plenty of re-playability. No character seem significantly overpowering another. Decent strategy for such a simple game. Fun for all ages.

Only issue is it is a game of elimination. Once a player is 'out' they are left to watch the rest battle it out. Beyond a code of fair-play for fun for all, there is nothing stopping everyone ganging on a single character to have their player sit out for the rest of the game-time.

I will play this from time to time as it works as a fun party game for those who don't like party games (like me!).

I received this game from my Secret Santa of 2012.

I also bought Red Dragon Inn 2 and the Allies Expansion Pooky and Erin the Ever-Changing.

One of my friend's favorites, but I am not a fan.  This game leans heavily towards chance, very little strategy and although there are multiple characters to add some depth, they all play exactly the same.  While each character has its own deck giving them special abilities, other then changing the name and description they are pretty much identical.  I found this game boring after only a couple of plays, and physically cringe when it is suggested or brought out.  The upside is it is very easy to learn, and I can see how people would like it especially as an entry game.

Enjoyable game of action vs counter-action. A very good stepping stone for those new to non-traditional games because it is simple enough to learn without feeling overwhelming while maintaining game-play elements that teach the underlying schools of thought necessary to make a player competitive and able to enjoy more involved games.

Really fun game and great for a laugh, my local gaming club love it.  There's not a lot of strategy to it, but its a lite Beer and Pretzels game, that plays in 20 minutes or so, so I'm fine living with that downside.
